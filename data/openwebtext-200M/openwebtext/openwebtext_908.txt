Amazon is developing a habit of placing its New York City press events at topic - appropriate venues .
Its last one , during which it introduced the Kindle 2 , was held in the Morgan Library .
This time around , the setting was an auditorium at Pace University , which hinted that rumors of an educational initiative were on the mark .
In fact , all the rumors turned out to be on the mark — there will be a new , large - screen Kindle DX on sale this summer , and it will be paired with a new effort by newspaper publishers to get more subscribers via the device .
But the details of the publisher and education initiatives were n't available today , and the new device is n't vastly different from the Kindle 2 .
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos started things off by reiterating that the company 's ultimate goal is to have every book ever written available wirelessly in under 60 seconds .
So far , it 's a bit short , having 275,000 e-books available at the moment .
The good news , however , is that sales of those are up to 35 percent of Amazon 's total where both a print and e-book version are available .
Those numbers leaped after the Kindle 2 introduction ; prior to that , they appear to have plateaued at under 15 percent .
Amazonian chieftain Jeff Bezos explains why the Kindle is as good as a book .
Bezos then went off on a bit of a weird tangent , suggesting that some sort of Kindle device would usher us into the truly paperless world .
" Paper is worth the hassle of printing , because it 's just better , " Bezos said , standing in front of an image of an ink cartridge an saying " we sell a lot of those . "
Apparently , " all that light shining in your eyes " from active matrix screens makes for eye strain , and we'd all happily ditch both printing and reading on screen if we just had a the right combination of E Ink screen and software .
I do n't know what planet Bezos is living on , but I could spend an entire article outlining where that argument is off .
In any case , he used it as a launching pad to introduce the Kindle DX , the big - screen version of the device .
With a 9.7 - inch screen , it certainly can display documents in a more comfortable format , and it has been paired with a native PDF renderer that means the end of document conversion .
Now , simply plug in the device to a computer via USB , drop the PDFs in place , and they 're good to go .
The DX also comes with 3.3GB of storage , meaning that you can happily store a pretty significant number of documents , provided they 're not too image - heavy .
A standard - sized business card indicates the Kindle DX 's scale .
The DX also has accelerometers , and the software will rotate the screen to match however you hold it .
That 's especially nice considering that the DX lacks the double - sided arrangement of buttons on the regular sized device .
In another indication that the company is making strides when it comes to interface design , if you rotate it upside down , the four - way pointer adjusts so that directing the cursor still works as you 'd expect it .
To fit the bigger screen without turning the device into a cafeteria tray , the keyboard has been compressed vertically , and the keys are now wider ovals .
They also have a more pleasant action , which will make things like taking notes easier to manage .
Content deals
And Amazon fully expects people to be taking notes with the device .
Next fall , a number of universities will be running pilot programs with the DX ; Bezos listed Arizona State , Case Western , Reed , Princeton , and the University of Virginia .
Pace itself , the host of the event , apparently completed a deal too late to be included , but had someone in the lobby , announcing its participation .
Pace may actually be the most interesting of the lot , as its student population is very ethnically and linguistically diverse , and generally commutes to and from classes .
The campuses will have access to a decent collection of materials , since Amazon has cut deals with three leading providers of textbooks : Pearson , Cengage Learning , and Wiley .
What will these programs look like ?
Will the students get subsidized devices and texts ?
Nobody would say ; Amazon spokespeople simply said each campus would describe the structure of its program when plans are finalized later this year .
All that was said is that consumers expect their digital text to be cheaper than one that requires raw materials , and Amazon expects that textbook makers will adapt to consumer expectations .
A similar lack of detail characterized the deal with traditional print companies .
The Boston Globe , New York Times , and Washington Post would all be starting pilot programs with the release of the DX , but all that was revealed about them was that they 'd offer discounted rates to people willing to commit to long - term subscriptions .
The Times ' Arthur Sulzberger , Jr. came on the stage to say that the Kindle was an important step for newspapers , but dropped lots of hints that he did n't view it as the last step , saying , " we 're launching trials to determine how best to use it . "
He also suggested that his program would be limited to people in areas where home delivery is n't an option , which would severely limit its scope .
Newspaper content looks much better when supersized .
So , what to make of the announcements ?
Given the lack of detail , it 's really hard to say .
It was n't even clear whether the parties involved really know what they 're doing ; Barbara R. Snyder , president of Case Western , praised the device as bringing students into a new era where their textbook content and documents mingle .
But she also said that the Kindle would let them exchange documents without the need for WiFi , while an Amazon spokesperson said that the only way to exchange documents involved tethering to a computer and working from there .
You also can't browse the Web to a PDF and access it from the Kindle , meaning a trip to the desktop computer is needed in those cases , as well .
If Amazon 's vision is wireless access to everything , it clearly still has a lot of work to do .
As for the device itself , giving consumers another point on the balance between compact form factor and screen size is undoubtedly a good thing , as is the built - in PDF reader .
The documents chosen by Amazon to highlight the feature looked excellent , but I 'll reserve judgment until I put a few of my own on one of the devices .
In all other respects , however , it 's just a big version of the Kindle 2 .
Well , all respects but one , and that may be the deal - breaker : a hefty $ 489 price tag .
Everybody heard the tweets : after several other security issues , including " exotic " ones like Clickjacking or JSON hijacking , Twitter is in serious troubles again , this time with an old - school XSS worm which quickly managed to infect many users profiles and is still spreading in multiple variants .
This plague is the brainchild of a 17 years old named Mikeyy , who created it as a publicity stunt to promote his own Twitter clone , StalkDaily.com .
A good technical description of its rather simple inner workings has been kindly provided by Damon Cortesi .
As you can see , unless the mikeyylolz.uuuq.com doman is allowed to run JavaScript ( very unlikely for NoScript users ) you 're immune from infection .
This worm having been active so long is quite a surprise to me , since the exploited vulnerability ( missing output encoding on users ' profile web page URL ) requires less than one minute to be fixed , if you know what you 're doing .
The existence of a mildly obfuscated version authorizes a scary suspect : have Twitter guys just been trying to block the original strain by signature , rather than fixing their website error ?
This is would be ridiculous * , since any script kiddie can create his own slightly modified version for fun or profit ( and is probably doing that ) .
And while the initial code just logs your session cookie on a remote server ( which is already bad enough ) and replicates itself as spam , nothing restrains a more malicious attacker from taking over your account with all its profile data right away .
The morale of this story ?
Never tweet without NoScript .
* Update
Ridicolous , but apparently true : in Twitter 's first hand account of the countermeasures taken over the weekend , there 's a lot of " cleaning up and locking down profiles " , but nothing about fixing the website 's bugs which allow infections like this to be spread .
Ever wonder what kind of office a cutting - edge architect actually works in ?
If you 're employed at the Selgas Cano architectural firm near Madrid , it looks something like this .

One edge of this long , tubular office is made entirely of glass , simultaneously helping workers feel closer to nature and a bit like they 're slaving away in a hermetically sealed research station on a faraway dystopian planet .
A unique experience , to be sure .

Though it 's not apparent in the first picture , most of the office is underground , zoo - exhibit - style .
This apparently helps save on heating and cooling bills , but to try to make a practical defense of such a proudly overdesigned structure is kind of missing the point .

Facebook and CFO Gideon
Yu did not part ways because the company needs a CFO with public company experience .
A source familiar with Facebook admits that 's just spin .
We do n't know exactly why Facebook and Gideon parted ways , but after talking to several sources inside and outside the company , we believe it basically happened for a reason that contributed to several top executives -- specifically including Owen Van Natta and Matt Cohler -- quitting the company in the past 13 months .
Mark Zuckerberg no longer tolerates open disagreement or challenging discussion in meetings from his top lieutenants .
" There 's no dissent in meetings , " says a source .
" It 's basically like we 're at GM or GE . "
It was n't always like that , one of the disgruntled former Facebook employees tells us :
The reason why we were good in the early days was that dissent was allowed and encouraged .
That 's the reason you go to a startup .
That early team was amazing .
That early team is gone .
Many of its members planned to leave eventually , but not as soon as they did .
We hear that Matt Cohler , for example , left " several millions " on the table when he quit Facebook to become a Benchmark Capital partner earlier than he planned to .
So what happened ?
A couple of explanations :
By bringing in Sheryl Sandberg and Elliot Schrage , Mark Zuckerberg hired two executives who are very good at PR .
Since when you 're holding a hammer everything looks like a nail , Facebook now focuses far more on its public image than it ever used to .
Says one source , " entire meetings are about PR and what we 're going to say to the public .
In the old days [ PR ] was almost scorned . "
An executive team obsessed with the company 's image is n't usually one that will eagerly embrace messy disagreements .
Mark Zuckerberg has begun " believing his own hype , " a source says .
He believes he is the genius the magazine covers say he is .
Mark has always been an executive who made life difficult for those he disagreed with .
" Mark is a very demanding person to work for , if you screw up , one day you are in , the next day out , persona non grata , " says one former employee .
Now that he thinks he 's Steve Jobs , he 's unbearable .
What the specific disagreement between Mark and Gideon was , we can't say .
( Fill us in : nicholas@businessinsider ) .
Gideon
Yu is the guy who crafted the biggest deal in the Web 2.0 era , selling YouTube to Google for $ 1.65 billion .
Gideon
Yu is the guy who , selling 1.6 % Facebook to Microsoft for $ 240 million , found the cash to fuel Facebook 's remarkable growth to 200 million users .
Facebook investors should ask themselves whether it's really in the company 's interest for Mark Zuckerberg not to tolerate dissenting opinions from folks like that .

Officials in the former communist Czechoslovakia had planned to build an underground rail link under Austria to the Adriatic , a Czech newspaper says .
The 410 km - long ( 255 miles ) tunnel would have drastically shortened the journey to the seaside for the landlocked country , Lidove Noviny reports .
The earth from the excavation would be dumped in the sea to form an artificial Czechoslovak island - Adriaport .
But the 1975 plan never got off - or under - the ground , the newspaper says .
High - speed trains
The plan was proposed by Professor Karel Zlabek .
He devised a railway tunnel that would have linked the town of Ceske Budejovice , in south Bohemia , and the port of Koper in what is now Slovenia , then Yugoslavia .
The project envisaged that high - speed trains would take both tourists and exports to the Adriatic coast in about two hours .
Work never started on the tunnel .
But that was not because it was totally unrealistic , the BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says .
Modern - day engineers say building work could start tomorrow .
But the project failed to address several key questions .
Apart from the sheer expense , one of the key issues was whether the Austrians would have let a Communist country build a tunnel underneath their feet , our correspondent says .
He adds for decades many Czechs have headed each summer to the Croatian coast in search of sun , sea and sandy beaches .
An essential precondition was better membership .
The council ’s precursor , the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , was folded in 2006 mainly because it had , for too long , allowed gross violators of human rights like Sudan and Zimbabwe to block action on their own abuses .

The council was supposed to be different .
For the first time , countries agreed to take human rights records into account when voting for the council ’s members , and those member - states that failed to , in the words of the founding resolution , “ uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights ” would find themselves up for review and their seats endangered .
For victims of human rights abuses and advocates for human rights worldwide , the reforms offered the hope of a credible and effective body .
Now , it seems , principle has given way to expediency .
Governments have resumed trading votes for membership in various other United Nations bodies , putting political considerations ahead of human rights .
The absence of competition suggests that states that care about human rights simply do n’t care enough .
Latin America , a region of flourishing democracies , has allowed Cuba to bid to renew its membership .
Asian countries have unconditionally endorsed the five candidates running for their region ’s five seats  among them , China and Saudi Arabia .
In past years , Western countries encouraged rights - respecting states from other regions to compete for election .
This year , they have ceded the high ground by presenting a non-competitive slate for the council elections .
New Zealand withdrew when the United States declared its candidacy , leaving just three countries  Belgium , Norway and the United States  running for three seats .
Even where competition is guaranteed , it is minimal .
In the Eastern Europe region  which under the United Nations ’ rules includes all countries behind the former Iron Curtain , including my own , the Czech Republic  the countries running for re-election are Azerbaijan and Russia , whose human rights records oscillate from questionable to despicable .
Only Hungary has stepped forward to compete for the region ’s two seats .
The reluctance of Eastern European states to reclaim leadership from human rights abusers does not inspire confidence .
NRA sues S.F. over firearms laws SAN FRANCISCO
The National Rifle Association has filed suit against the city of San Francisco , Mayor Gavin Newsom and Police Chief Heather Fong , taking aim at city laws it contends violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms .
The NRA filed the lawsuit in federal court Friday on behalf of six residents and the San Francisco Veteran Police Officers Association .
It challenges three provisions of the city 's police code that it says interfere with their right " to defend themselves and others ... within their own homes . "
The provisions are :
-- A requirement that handguns in San Francisco homes be kept in a locked cabinet or disabled with a trigger lock .
-- A ban on the sale of fragmenting bullets - a particularly deadly type of ammunition .
-- A city ordinance that prohibits the discharge of firearms within city limits .
The law has been on the books since 1938 , and is seldom , if ever , enforced , according to city officials .
Neither the association nor the attorney who filed the suit for the NRA could be reached for comment Monday afternoon .
The suit alleges that because of the city 's failure to repeal the code sections , the plaintiffs in the case " are subjected to irreparable harm , in that they are unable to keep their handguns within their home in a manner ready for immediate use to protect themselves and their families from attack by violent intruders . "
It seeks to have the laws invalidated .
Matt Dorsey , a spokesman for the city attorney 's office , said the NRA 's real goal is not to strike down the specific city laws but to win court rulings that expand the reach of the Second Amendment .
" It 's more about pushing the envelope of the Second Amendment and setting new precedents and policies , " he said .
The trigger - lock requirement , signed into law in 2006 , prevents residents from having " operable " handguns at their disposal , according to the suit .
It argues that the U.S. Supreme Court , in the 2008 Heller decision , struck down a similar trigger - lock requirement in Washington as unconstitutional because it made it impractical for residents to protect themselves .
San Francisco 's trigger - lock restriction combined with a fragmenting bullet ban that precludes them from loading their weapons with " suitable ammunition , " the suit says , " makes it impossible for city residents to use their handguns for the core lawful purpose of self - defense , particularly in urgent , life - threatening situations . "
Dorsey , who accused the NRA of engaging in a nationwide suit - filing spree since the Supreme Court ruling , said San Francisco expects to prevail .
" I do n't believe anything in federal law invalidates the provisions of the San Francisco ordinances , " he said .
It 's fairly likely that you already have a personalized setting for PS1 , the default bash interaction prompt .
But what about the others available : PS2 , PS3 , and PS4 ?
Most likely , you already have a personalized setting for PS1 , the default bash interaction prompt .
Here 's what to do with PS2 , PS3 and PS4 .
PS1 is the default interaction prompt .
To set it to give you
username@host : directory $
export PS1 = " u@h w$ "
~/.bash_rc
u
h
w
usein youris the current username , the current host , and the working directory .
There 's a list of escape codes you can use in the bash man page , or in the Bash Prompt HOWTO
PS2 is the prompt you get when you extend a command over multiple lines by putting at the end of a line and hitting return .
By default it 's just > , but you can make this a little more obvious with :
export PS2 = " more -> "
juliet@glade :~ $ very - long - command - here more -> - with - lots - of - options
so it looks like :
PS3 governs the prompt that shows up if you use the select statement in a shell script .
The default is #? , so if you do nothing to change that , the select statement will print out the options and then just leave that prompt .
Alternatively , use this :
PS3 =" Choose an option : " select i in yes maybe no do # code to handle reply done
1 ) yes 2 ) maybe 3 ) no Choose an option :
which will output :
Far more readable for the user !
Finally , PS4 is the prompt shown when you set the debug mode on a shell script using set -x at the top of the script .
This echoes each line of the script to STDOUT before executing it .
The default prompt is ++ .
More usefully , you can set it to display the line number , with :
export PS4='$ LINENO + '
Massachusetts attorney 's office tells workers to avoid the Drudge Report because of a potential virus .
( The Site 's creator , Matt Drudge is photographed here ) U.S. attorney 's office : Stay off Drudge !
The U.S. attorney ’s office in Massachusetts directed employees earlier this month not to log onto the Drudge Report website with government - issued computers due to potential viruses on the site .
In an e-mail message sent May 4 , Paul Harvey , an information - technology official for the Boston office , wrote that security specialists with the U.S. attorney ’s office at the Justice Department asked them “ to reformat / reimage two computers because the user visited the drudgereport.com site . ”

“ Please avoid the Drudgereport website from the [ United States attorney ’s office ] computers , ” Harvey wrote .
Harvey said that if employees had a “ work - related reason to visit the site , ” access could be provided off the government network .
Asked why the conservative - leaning news aggregator and President Barack Obama critic was flagged by Internet security officials , Tracy Schmaler , a Justice Department spokeswoman , said it was because “ a malicious code was found contained in a Web ad on Drudge . ”
Schmaler also said the request to stay off Drudge was n’t politically motivated and said it was sent only to the office in Massachusetts .
She also said other popular sites were later found to have potential viruses , including ESPN.com .

Monads in mathematics 3 : monads from adjunctions
2 March 2009 at 12:13 am
The adjunction property between two functors , and , says that there is a natural bijection between morphisms ( in the first category ) and ( in the second category ) .
Here natural means that these bijection is compatible with composition with morphisms , or and .
Adjunctions are naturally created by the use of monads or operads .
For example , the functor mapping a set X to the free vector space with basis X , has a adjoint , , mapping a vector space to the set of its elements .
The meaning of the adjunction is that a morphism is equivalent to the choice of images of basis vectors where W is considered as as set .
Similar adjunctions exist for other free objects ( free algebras , free groups , free modules ) .
Another fundamental adjunction relates products and exponentials in the following sense .
If X , Y and Z are sets , the bijection adjoins the functors and .
A similar adjunction works for modules or vector spaces , and states .
An informal way of describing adjoint functors is that one of the functors describes how to obtain morphisms to / from objects created by the other functor ( these morphisms are said to be representable ) .
For example , morphisms from a free vector space are described by picking elements in the target , so the “ free vector space ” functor is adjoint to the “ set of elements ” functor .
Monads from adjunction
Arbitrary pairs of adjoint functors define monads in the following way : if T and U are adjoint functors as before ( T being the left adjoint and U the right adjoint ) .
Recall that the adjunction between T and U says that U describes morphisms coming from objects of the form TX .
Then the identity should be represented by a morphism .
Is is then a simple but head - aching exercise to show that UT is a monad and understand what it means .
When U is the “ set of elements ” functor and T the “ free thing ” functor , UT is the “ free thing ” monad in the sense of my first post .
Beware that TU does not define a monad , but a comonad ( whose definition has arrows going the other way ) : the natural morphism is .
The product / exponential adjunction defines a comonad which is the evaluation map .
There is also a monad ( mapping to ) : applying it twice yields which has a natural morphism towards using the evaluation map .
This monad can model computations with side effects ( the State monad of Haskell ) : these computations would usually be described as maps where S is the set of states , but these are exactly the same as maps ( using the adjunction ) , which syntaxically allows going from stateless objects to state - dependent objects .
This is an example of why the formalism of monads can be relevant in modeling real - world phenomena .

April 1st is a very tough day to report big , controversial news - if you want to be believed that is .
Fact :
The new X - Men movie has leaked to BitTorrent and Fox wo n't be laughing .
The movie is unfinished with many special effects yet to be added .
Fingers are already being pointed toward the possible source of the leak and downloads are already more than 75,000 .
April 1st .
What fun .
Everywhere you look torrent sites and release sites are being shut down , that ’s if they are n’t teaming up with the movie studios .
But what if there ’s some really serious news to report ?
What if one of the summer ’s biggest sci- fi movies leaked out onto the Internet way before its release , and before it was even completed ?
Still unconvinced ?
This is the reality today with Fox ’s ‘ upcoming ’ X - Men Origins : Wolverine and it ’s spreading with determination on BitTorrent .
At the time of writing there are at least three different ‘ workprint ’ versions , presumably from the same source .
One is reported to be a few minutes longer than the others but all are missing special effects .
The film , penned for a May 1 2009 release , was due to compete alongside the likes of Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen and Star Trek in this year ’s summer blockbuster campaigns but has ‘ premiered ’ a little earlier than planned .
Here at TorrentFreak we ’ve been monitoring this leak and since the movie hit BitTorrent just a few hours ago it has been downloaded at least 75,000 times , a rate comparable to that of the DVDrip ‘ release ’ of The Dark Knight .
Interest is likely to be significant .
X - Men ’s target audience are tech - savvy people who are likely to have heard about BitTorrent .
Multiply this by the desire to see something unusual and something you ’re not supposed to have ( like an unfinished Hollywood sci - fi movie ) and things got hot – quickly .
The leak is the source of much speculation , but one particularly interesting discussion surrounds the source of the leak of this ‘ workprint ’ copy .
Many early ‘ reviewers ’ of the movie noted that not only was the video and audio of a high quality ( screenshots ) , but there were no ‘ watermarks ’ .
This is not strictly true .
A little way into the movie from the top of the screen pops a very brief message which names Rising Sun Pictures and a date , 2nd March 2009 .
Founded in 1995 , Rising Sun Pictures ( RSP ) is an Australian visual effects company which has previously worked on the Harry Potter , Superman and Batman movies , so they have quite a pedigree .
Of course RSP would absolutely not endorse any leak and the leak could have happened before the print even reached them , but somehow a print marked with their company name has made it onto the Internet and the downloads are mounting quickly .
Another interesting development is that Devin Faraci over at Chud.com said that he ’d been told that the Wolverine DVD had been “ switching hands ” over the last couple of weeks .
TorrentFreak contacted Rising Sun Pictures but as yet we ’ve had no response .
Update : Fox has released a statement confirming the leak .
The FBI and MPAA are investigating the case .
It began with an anodyne press release from the Metropolitan police more than three hours after Ian Tomlinson died .
It ended with a police officer and an investigator from the Independent Police Complaints Commission asking the Guardian to remove a video from its website showing an unprovoked police assault on Mr Tomlinson minutes before his heart attack .
In the space of five days through a combination of official guidance , strong suggestion and press releases , those responsible for examining the circumstances surrounding Mr Tomlinson 's death within the City of London police and the IPCC , appeared to be steering the story to what they thought would be its conclusion : that the newspaper vendor suffered an unprovoked heart attack as he made his way home on the night of the G20 protests .
Late last Friday , after investigators from the IPCC had spoken to detectives from City police , the commission which claims it is the most powerful civilian oversight body in the world , was preparing to say it did not need to launch an inquiry into the deathduring one of the most controversial recent policing operations .
But the release of the video by the Guardian this week , which revealed Mr Tomlinson was subjected to an unprovoked attack by a Met riot squad officer minutes before he died , has forced the IPCC to step up to the demand that it launch a full independent inquiry .
" They have caught a real cold on this , " said a senior source .
" They were very slow , they clearly did n't think anything was wrong and they did n't look for it .
Sometimes they just do n't seem to be very independent . "
A former IPCC insider went further , blaming a " cosy " relationship with the police for the commission 's failure to act quickly .
" The problem with the IPCC is that it is too late to start inquiries and they go on for too long , " said John Crawley , a commissioner for four years .
" They should have picked this up as an independent investigation straight away .
There was strong public interest given the concern about the ' kettling ' tactics being used to police the protests and the need to gain the confidence of those demonstrators with information to come forward to someone who was n't the police . "
Policing operation
Until yesterday it all seemed to have gone so well for Met commanders .
For several hours on 1 April thousands of demonstrators had been trapped in a cordon outside the Bank of England and troublemakers were identified on handheld cameras carried by police teams .
Around midnight teams of baton - wielding riot police with dogs were sent to clear hundreds of peaceful protesters from the climate camp in Bishopsgate while the national media was absent .
Dissenters , who claimed officers were pumped - up , were dismissed by senior figures who said their teams were involved in a difficult balancing act of respecting the right to protest while tackling about 300 people committed to violence and criminal damage .
When Mr Tomlinson died during the police operation , the Met chose to delay announcing it for more than three hours .
Its statement pointed a finger at protesters .
" The officers gave him an initial check and cleared his airway before moving him back behind the cordon line to a clear area outside the Royal Exchange Building where they gave him CPR , " it said .
" The officers took the decision to move him as during this time a number of missiles - believed to be bottles - were being thrown at them .
The force refused yesterday to reveal why it took so long to announce someone had died within the demonstration area , or to address the question of where the information about missiles being thrown at police officers had come from .
Witnesses who aided Mr Tomlinson have always contested that police had been attacked by a hail of missiles .
Thus began the official narrative of Mr Tomlinson 's death .
The next day the IPCC said the incident had been referred to it by the Met and it would be " assessing the circumstances throughout the day ... examining CCTV and attending the postmortem " .
In the meantime the investigation was being handled by the City of London police because it happened in its area .
At Gold command headquarters , where senior officers were gathered on Thursday there was talk of the Tomlinson family mentioning concerns to police about his health .
That line was seized upon and used as heavy guidance for journalists who spoke to City police about the death in the days that followed .
" His family were not surprised to hear what had happened , " the guidance went .
When pressed about the nature of the inquiry and whether Mr Tomlinson had any contact with officers , journalists were told speculation " upset the family " .
Photographs
Requests to speak to the family were met with a refusal and instead City police put out a statement , in which the family were quoted as saying : " The police are keeping us informed of any developments . "
But one major development was kept from them .
On Friday , the Guardian made City of London police aware it had obtained photographs of Mr Tomlinson on the pavement in front of riot officers .
It has since emerged that those images showed the immediate aftermath of the attack .
While police did not see the images , they were aware of a suggestion Mr Tomlinson had been involved in an altercation with a police .
The family were not told this .
Throughout that day the police refused to talk about why Mr Tomlinson 's postmortem examination had been twice delayed .
The IPCC said it was still assessing what was going on and could not comment on reports of altercations .
In reality , Crawley said , the IPCC 's assessment would have involved an investigator talking to City police and viewing some CCTV footage .
What the commission did not do was seek or speak to civilian witnesses , or investigate other sources of information before making its decision .
On Saturday details of Mr Tomlinson 's postmortem examination were released by City police .
Independent approaches to the coroner were met with a refusal to comment .
City police would not comment on whether any other findings had come from the postmortem , for example marks on his head and body from a baton blow .
On Sunday , the pictures obtained by the Guardian showing Mr Tomlinson on the ground in front of police were published .
Around 10.30 am the Tomlinson family attended the scene of the death , where they spoke to the Guardian about allegations he had been assaulted by police .
They said they were glad the pictures had come out and wanted more answers .
They were concerned about allegations that Tomlinson had been assaulted .
They gave the Guardian their names , telephone numbers and address and then attended a church memorial service .
It was then , during the service , that the family 's police liaison officer told the Guardian he was extremely unhappy the paper had spoken to them .
He told the Guardian 's reporter not to contact the family " for 48 hours " .
Meanwhile official guidance from the IPCC to another Guardian journalist accused the paper of doorstepping the family at a time of grief .
The IPCC guided that the family had been deeply distressed by the newspaper 's approach .
On the same day the IPCC told journalists from rival publications there was " nothing in the story " that Mr Tomlinson had been assaulted by an officer .
On Tuesday night when the video of the assault was released , an IPCC investigator and a City of London officer visited the Guardian 's offices in King 's Cross to be handed a dossier of evidence .
They asked that the video was removed from the website , claiming it was " jeopardising " their inquiry and not helpful to the family .
By now Tomlinson 's family had found their own voice .
They told the Guardian : " Now we do know police did have contact with him .
Thanks for everything you have done so far . "
In the " City of God , " St. Augustine tells the story of a pirate captured by Alexander the Great .
The Emperor angrily demanded of him , " How dare you molest the seas ? "
To which the pirate replied , " How dare you molest the whole world ?
Because I do it with a small boat , I am called a pirate and a thief .
You , with a great navy , molest the world and are called an emperor . "
St. Augustine thought the pirate 's answer was " elegant and excellent . "
The quote is from Noam Chomsky 's Pirates and Emperors and is cited by Ralph Raico at the Liberty and Power Blog .

A new kind of laser could mean cheaper gadgets for all ( Image : John Rensten / Photodisc / Getty )
Lasers might be pushing 50 , but they are still the youthful pin-ups of fundamental physics .
Since the first one was unveiled in 1960 , the more apocalyptic predictions of how they might be used – as death rays , for example – have proved to be overblown .
Their peaceful application , on the other hand , can be seen everywhere from cutting and welding to combating cancer and cataracts , to powering telecoms and consumer electronics , and has mushroomed into an industry worth $ 6 billion in 2007 .
Advances in the laser lab translate into gadgets in our homes at astonishing speed : think of the progression from CD to DVD and now Blu-ray technology in just a few decades .
So here ’s a heads - up for you : we could be about to witness the next stage in the laser ’s evolution , a sea change in how laser light is produced .
A new wave of devices looks likely to exploit particle - like packets of energy to produce their light – packets that are neither light , nor matter , but both .
It ’s early days , but advances in taming these exotic beasts are proceeding apace .
“ I keep expecting progress to end , ” says physicist Jeremy Baumberg at the University of Cambridge , one of the pioneers .
“ But it just keeps going . ”
The pay - offs could be immense : not just lasers that use less juice than ever before and new low - power lighting technology but maybe even a way to make the semi-mythical , superpowerful quantum computer .
What is this new item in the physicist ’s armoury ?

There are moments in modern history when particular struggles galvanise millions around the world to act in solidarity .
This occurred during the Spanish Civil War , the struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialism and the liberation struggles of Southern Africa .
The time has now come for progressive humanity to cut through the obfuscations , canards and calumnies and meaningfully support the resistance of the Palestinian people .
For more than 60 years Palestinians have alerted us to one outrage after another , injustices piled upon injustices without the commensurate scale of global solidarity required to make a significant difference to their lives .
It is now in our hands to change this unconscionable situation .
Not by appealing to the ruling classes of the world and their institutions -- which remain , in the face of abundant evidence , unmoved , callous and hypocritical .
Which in fact sustain and provide succour to Israel ’s apartheid and terror .
It is rather by applying the most potent weapon we have learnt to rely on , forged and steeled through the tried and tested struggles of workers and oppressed people spanning time and space : solidarity .
International solidarity in this sense in the words of the late Mozambican revolutionary , Samora Machel is “ not an act of charity but an act of unity between allies fighting on different terrains toward the same objectives ” .
Acts of defiance and determination against overwhelming odds continue to drive the will of Palestinians .
Global solidarity activists need to be inspired and strengthened by this unleashing of creative energies ; the fact that obstacles can be surmounted and the debilitating wastefulness of internecine and sectarian conflicts exposed .
Israel : a fundamentalist and militarised warrior state
The Palestinian struggle does not only exert a visceral tug on many around the world .
A reading of imperialism shows that apartheid Israel is needed as a fundamentalist and militarised warrior state not only to quell the undefeated and unbowed Palestinians but also as a rapid response fount of reaction in concert with despotic Arab regimes to do the Empire ’s bidding in the Middle East and beyond .
Over the years this has included support for the mass terror waged against the people of Central and South America and facilitating the evasion of international sanctions against South Africa .
Besides providing a ready supply of mercenaries to terrorise a populace -- whether in Guatemala , Iraq or New Orleans -- Israel also lends its expertise of collective punishment and mass terror .
We have to recognise that the foundation of the Israeli economy was founded on the special political and military role which Zionism then and today fulfils for Western imperialism .
While playing its role to ensure that the region is safe for oil companies it has also carved out today a niche market producing high - tech security essential for the day - to - day functioning of New Imperialism .
The unrestrained hand of US imperialism and its support for barbarism whether in Iraq or Palestine should hasten our actions .
In Gaza , 80 per cent of the population live in poverty and close to a million people have no access to fresh water , electricity and other essential services .
Close to 70,000 workers have lost their jobs in the siege of Gaza .
The killing of Palestinians continues on a ferocious basis -- daily missiles are launched from US - made helicopters and fighter jets .
These cowardly war crimes are carried out with impunity -- no longer even meriting a mention in the mainstream press .
In the light of these killings and the slow starvation of the inhabitants of Gaza , as well as the frequent “ incursions ” into the West Bank , the obsequiousness of the Abbas regime becomes all the more abject .
The fanfare and din surrounding the Annapolis “ breakthrough ” is one more hoax designed to assuage the conscience and lull the “ international community ” to slumber .
Karma Nabulsi wrote at the time of this spectacle :
The tarnished trickery of those tired catchphrases “ last chance for peace ” , “ painful compromises ” , “ moderates against extremists ” is now worn so thin a child would not be deceived .
It is a meeting to legitimise the status quo .
There is an intense defeatism pervading the mainstream media and tired politicians without valour everywhere .
But there is a hopeful reality : many ordinary citizens all over the world have not given up and the Palestinians have not given up on themselves .
Palestinians remain steadfast and courageous .
Despite the complexities of the Palestinian resistance and the conflict between Fatah and Hamas , and without discouraging criticism , we outside the Israeli dungeons and the rubble of the Israeli war machine have a responsibility to support the Palestinian struggle .
I believe this can be accomplished through the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions Campaign ( BDS ) proposed by a wide array of Palestinian trade unions , and academic , student and political organisations representing the vast majority of the Palestinian people ( see http://www.pacbi.org).
Other writings have justified the need for this strategy , so it will suffice here to quote an American currently residing in South Africa , Virginia Tilley , who in the aftermath of the cluster bombing by Israel of Lebanon wrote :
It is finally time .
After years of internal arguments , confusion , and dithering , the time has come for a full - fledged international boycott of Israel .
Good cause for a boycott has , of course , been in place for decades , as a raft of initiatives already attests .
But Israel 's war crimes are now so shocking , its extremism so clear , the suffering so great , the UN so helpless , and the international community 's need to contain Israel 's behavior so urgent and compelling , that the time for global action has matured .
A coordinated movement of divestment , sanctions , and boycotts against Israel must convene to contain not only Israel 's aggressive acts and crimes against humanitarian law but also , as in South Africa , its founding racist logics that inspired and still drive the entire Palestinian problem .
Lessons from the campaign to isolate apartheid South Africa
It will be helpful to draw activists ’ attention to some of the egregious lessons from the campaign to isolate apartheid South Africa , bearing in mind Amilcar Cabral ’s “ tell no lies , claim no easy victories ” advice to revolutionaries .
First , it took a few decades of hard work before the boycott campaign made an impact .
Despite the impression given by many governments , unions and faith - based groups that they supported the isolation of the apartheid state from the outset this is just not true .
Besides the infamous words of Dick Cheney , when as a senator he called for the continued incarceration of Nelson Mandela because he was a “ terrorist ” quite late in the day , and the support given by US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Thatcher , together with regimes like dictator Pinochet ’s Chile , Israel and others , most powerful institutions , multilateral organisations and unions were hesitant for many years to fully support the campaign .
The Anti-Apartheid Movement ( AAM ) was formed in 1959 and the first significant breakthrough came in 1963 when Danish dock workers refused to off - load South African goods .
The rise of the AAM must be seen in the general effervescence of liberation struggles and social movements in the turbulent 1960s / early 1970s and in the context of , whatever our opinion was of the USSR and its motivations , a counterweight to the US hegemon .
This , together with the viciousness of the pro-Israeli lobby , its opportunistic reference to the Holocaust and anti-Semitism and the post - 9/11 climate of fear , silencing dissent and Islamophobia , makes the task of isolating apartheid Israel more difficult .
Despite these seemingly daunting obstacles the movement for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel is gaining momentum and already some significant gains have been made .
Gains which would ’ve been difficult to imagine just a few years ago .
Second , arguments opposed to the boycott related to the harm it would cause black South African themselves and the need for dialogue and “ constructive engagement ” were easily rebuffed by lucid and knowledgeable arguments .
The South African regime , like the Israeli regime today , used ``homeland ’’ leaders and an assortment of collaborators to argue the case for them .
Careful research played an important role in exposing the economic , cultural and the armaments trade links with South Africa to make our actions more effective as well as to “ name and shame ” those who benefited from the apartheid regime .
Third , sectarianism is a danger that we must be vigilant about and principled unity must be our lodestar .
Some in the AAM favoured supporting only one liberation movement as the authentic voice of the oppressed in South Africa .
They also aspired to work largely with “ respectable ” organisations , governments and multilateral organisations and shunned the much harder and patient linking of struggles with grassroots organisations .
In the UK for instance as elsewhere this sectarian attitude resulted in debilitating splits .
The biggest chapter of the AAM in London , which supported the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland and was part of the ``Troops Out Movement ’’ , were ostracised by the official AAM .
The latter was also keen not to annoy the British government by taking a stronger stance against racism in Britain .
The healthy linking of struggles against racism , in support of the indigenous people and workers in North America with the Palestinian struggle that I have witnessed must be lauded .
At a huge Palestinian solidarity rally in South Africa recently members of the Palestinian Solidarity Committee were asked by officials from the Palestinian ambassador ’s office to pull down the flag of the Western Sahrawi Republic because they feared this would alienate the ambassador of Morocco .
We refused this request much to the glee of Polisario Front supporters present .
Fourth , the campaign for boycotts , divestment and sanctions must be in concert with supporting grassroots organisations in Palestine as a whole and in the Palestinian diaspora .
This can take many forms and shapes including ``twinning ’’ arrangements , speaking tours , targeted actions in support of specific struggles and concrete support .
Initially , the dominant liberation movement and its allies did not support the independent trade union movement in South Africa , which played a pivotal role in bringing down the apartheid regime .
Fifteen years after the first democratic election in South Africa the present neoliberal government is privatising municipal services .
The poor who cannot pay their rent are being evicted and failure to pay water and electricity bills mean frequent disconnections .
The government often calls the inability to pay user fees the “ culture of non-payment and entitlement ” .
A few years back we were horrified to see officials from the municipality of Cape Town present to a visiting Palestinian delegation , including a proud Saeeb Erekart , prepaid water meters .
This is not and should not be the solidarity we are talking about !
As a postscript an article in Haaertz written by Amira Hass in February 2008 , about a workers ’ strike in the West Bank , reads :
The workers have three main demands : adjusting wages to match the steep increase in the cost of living ; a realistic addition to the " travel expenses " component of salaries ( which has not risen since 1999 , in spite of the doubling and tripling of the cost of travel because of roadblocks and the increase in fuel prices ) , and overturning a new regulation that demands every resident procure a certificate of honesty based on " confirmation of debt payment . "
… Government spokesmen , headed by Fayyad , have often spoken against a " culture of non-payment of bills , " thus portraying the general Palestinian public as prone to being debt offenders …
Familiar language for us in South Africa and resistance to this neoliberalism is growing .
For Palestinians it is happening even before ``liberation ’’.
Hass writes :
The strike , and all the public and internal discussions accompanying it , is a fascinating lesson of how Palestinians still acknowledge the power of the collective ; how they oppose a liberal economic policy under occupation and colonization , and nurture a democratic suspicion as to the motives of the leading class .
Finally , the sanctions campaign in South Africa did produce gatekeepers , sectarians and commissars but they were also challenged .
Writing in support of the academic boycott a colleague , Shireen Hassim does not gloss over the problems :
The Obama administration has filed a brief in EFF 's lawsuit against the government for its program of illegal , mass wiretapping of Americans , defending the practice , arguing that the lawsuit should be dismissed , endorsing the Bush administration 's invented " State Secret " theory , and augmenting it with a new theory , that " the Patriot Act bars any lawsuits of any kind for illegal government surveillance unless there is " willful disclosure " of the illegally intercepted communications . "
This brief was not written by Bush cronies left behind by the outgoing administration : this is an invention of the Obama administration .
I do n't expect the guy to walk on water , but I 'd sure like it if he'd stop wallowing in the mud .
Every defining attribute of Bush 's radical secrecy powers — every one — is found here , and in exactly the same tone and with the exact same mindset .
Thus : how the U.S. government eavesdrops on its citizens is too secret to allow a court to determine its legality .
We must just blindly accept the claims from the President 's DNI that we will all be endangered if we allow courts to determine the legality of the President 's actions .
Even confirming or denying already publicly known facts — such as the involvement of the telecoms and the massive data - mining programs — would be too damaging to national security .
Why ?
Because the DNI says so .
It is not merely specific documents , but entire lawsuits , that must be dismissed in advance as soon as the privilege is asserted because " its very subject matter would inherently risk or require the disclosure of state secrets . "
What 's being asserted here by the Obama DOJ is the virtually absolute power of presidential secrecy , the right to break the law with no consequences , and immunity from surveillance lawsuits so sweeping that one can hardly believe that it 's being claimed with a straight face .
It is simply inexcusable for those who spent the last several years screaming when the Bush administration did exactly this to remain silent now or , worse , to search for excuses to justify this behavior .
As EFF 's Bankston put it : " President Obama promised the American people a new era of transparency , accountability , and respect for civil liberties .
But with the Obama Justice Department continuing the Bush administration 's cover -up of the National Security Agency 's dragnet surveillance of millions of Americans , and insisting that the much - publicized warrantless wiretapping program is still a " secret " that cannot be reviewed by the courts , it feels like deja vu all over again . "

A portable radar device is designed to make measurements of ice thickness
After enduring ferocious weather , it has emerged that British explorers studying the Arctic are struggling with a series of technical problems .
A portable radar device , known as Sprite , designed to make millions of measurements of the ice thickness , has been dogged by breakdowns and uncertainties .
Another instrument , SeaCat , meant to measure the temperature and salinity of the water beneath the sea-ice , has malfunctioned as well .
The expedition 's organisers insist that other research - such as regular drilling through the ice - has meanwhile been carried out successfully .
The radar system is dragged behind the sledge of expedition leader Pen Hadow and is meant to gather data about the ice for transmission via satellite to researchers .
But when the expedition , the Catlin Arctic Survey , set off in late February , it encountered an unexpected wind chill as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius , and the technology failed .
Cable break I understand that on the fifth day in these conditions , one of the radar system 's cables simply snapped .
On the ninth day it became clear that this had led to all the cables breaking .
So with the team 's early progress anyway hampered by the weather , the Sprite only gathered data over a total period of seven hours of trekking in the expedition 's first 18 days .
A resupply flight , which landed last month , collected the device for repairs back in the UK , and that work is now complete .
But support staff are still having trouble accessing the ice data stored inside it .
The same resupply flight also delivered a replacement radar to the expedition but it's not yet known how well it has functioned over the past few weeks or if its data can be retrieved .
Another resupply flight on Wednesday brought the team the original Sprite device , now repaired , together with the communications system .
Expedition organisers are now hoping that at last , after nearly 40 days on the ice , the radar data can be gathered and transmitted as planned .
Assuming they can retrieve any data collected earlier , they hope to have lost only 13 days ' worth of measurements in all - the period the original Sprite unit was out of action .
Resupply flight
The broken SeaCat device was extracted on the first resupply flight and a replacement is due to be delivered in a fortnight 's time .
Simon Harris - Ward , director of operations for the Catlin Arctic Survey , told the BBC : " Given the very extreme conditions they are operating in during the Arctic winter we were always going to face potential difficulties with the array of advanced technology despite our robust testing programme .
" We have been cautious about making any statement about Sprite simply because of a combination of factors .
First , an uncertainty about the exact nature of the problem and second , the inevitable delays in assessing data which had to be extracted on our re-supply flights before it could be analysed . "
" Most of the Catlin Arctic Survey science programme does not require data from Sprite and the Ice Team has been continuing to collect valuable data in its wider science programme , including measurements of the floating ice 's thickness .
So we remain confident in our ability to deliver data to our scientific partners . "
The expedition 's other research tasks include drilling through the ice by hand , on average four times a day .
With 102 holes drilled so far , hundreds of measurements have been made of ice thickness and snow cover over the 243 km covered to date .
The drillings have revealed a typical ice thickness of between 1.5 - 2 m which is far thinner than a previous generation of explorers encountered .
All this data - and any that can be gleaned from the radar system - will be sent to Arctic specialists at the US Navy Postgraduate School in Monterey , California , US , to help assess the likely fate of the sea-ice .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Medicare program for the elderly may offer ways to encourage better care at a lower cost as a big part of reforming the U.S. healthcare system , a leading Senate Democrat said on Tuesday .
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel talks to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus before a dinner at the White House , March 4 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
“ Medicare is the big driver here , ” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus told reporters following a committee discussion with industry groups on ways to change the payment system .
Politicians and experts agree it is important to reward doctors and hospitals for better quality of care and move away from a system that pays them based on the number of procedures and treatments .
Medicare accounts for about one - fifth of U.S. healthcare and private insurers tend to follow the government program ’s payment structure .
Baucus , who is taking a lead on writing healthcare reform legislation in the Senate , said he was optimistic Congress would enact a healthcare overhaul .
Revamping the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system is a top priority for President Barack Obama , who argues it is crucial to long - term U.S. economic recovery .
“ Everybody here wants to address quality and reimbursements based on quality , ” Baucus said .
It was the first of three meetings on reform , which Democrats who control Congress hope to deliver to Obama by the end of the year .
The next session will focus on covering the uninsured , Baucus said .
“ More is spent per person on health care in the United States than in any other nation in the world , and yet America has some of the worst health outcomes , ” committee member Senator Jay Rockefeller said in a statement .
Glenn Steele , president of the Geisinger Health System in Danville , Pennsylvania , told the committee Medicare could help lead changes .
LEVERAGE IN MEDICARE
“ I think the leverage is in Medicare , ” Steele told the panel .
The Geisinger system has been held up by analysts as an example of how to make payment reforms to improve quality of care and lower costs .
Steele said Medicare should focus reform efforts on patients with costly chronic conditions , who often do not receive good continuity or quality of care .
Studies show those patients account for a huge share of Medicare ’s costs .
Studies also have shown that patients in high cost areas do not get better care than those in lower cost regions .
Steele said Medicare should be given the flexibility to innovate and test different models of payments to improve care without undermining the quality of care .
But he also urged lawmakers to come up with a “ plan B ” if the system does not show improved care with lower costs in a short time .
AARP , an influential group that represents older Americans , said in a statement that changing Medicare to provide better care coordination , especially for people with multiple chronic conditions , was crucial to system reform .
“ Many gaps in care often occur at care transitions , as individuals move from one setting to another , such as from a hospital to home .
A lack of coordination and follow - up care can lead to unnecessary hospital readmissions , ” AARP said .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The wife of accused swindler Bernard Madoff pulled $ 15.5 million out of a Madoff - related brokerage firm in Massachusetts in the weeks before his arrest , authorities there disclosed Wednesday .
Bernard Madoff is under 24 - hour house arrest in his Upper East Side luxury apartment .
The withdrawals by Ruth Madoff took place in November and December , according to a complaint filed by state regulators against Cohmad Securities , a firm they said was " intertwined " with Madoff 's New York - based company .
The regulators say Cohmad has refused to provide information about its ties to Madoff , who is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that may have cost investors up to $ 50 billion .
Daily wire transaction reports show Cohmad was aware of transfers to and from Madoff - related accounts , the filing states .
" For example , the few reports produced by Cohmad show that Ruth Madoff withdrew $ 5.5 million on November 25 , 2008 and withdrew $ 10 million on December 10 , 2008 , " investigators said .
Bernard Madoff , 70 , was arrested December 11 and is currently under house arrest in his Manhattan luxury apartment .
He faces one charge of securities fraud in connection with an international scheme that has cost some investors their life savings and could face up to 20 years in prison and a $ 5 million fine if convicted .
In January , prosecutors tried to revoke his $ 10 million bail after he mailed more than $ 1 million worth of diamond - studded jewelry to friends and family , a move they said showed he was trying to move assets out of government hands .
But a judge ruled Madoff was neither a danger to the community nor a flight risk .
Prosecutors and Madoff 's lawyers have agreed for a second time to push back the deadline for an indictment or probable cause hearing for the former investor , sources close to the case said Wednesday .
The previous deadline of Wednesday -- which was itself a delay -- has now been moved back another 30 days .
Madoff and the Securities and Exchange Commission already have agreed to a partial civil judgment against the disgraced investment manager , one that could eventually force him to pay fines and return investors ' money .
Under the terms of the deal , Madoff will keep a previously reached agreement to freeze his assets and not to violate any other securities laws , but it does not require him to admit or deny any allegations .
CNN 's Allan Chernoff and Amy Sahba contributed to this report .

Ron Paul : ' Pretty sad ' that Limbaugh is GOP leader David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Monday March 2 , 2009
Print This Email This Demonstrating again his propensity to go out on a limb , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) had some choice words of criticism for Rush Limbaugh , the conservative media talk show host who was the star attraction at last weekends Conservative Political Action Conference .
In a phone interview Monday morning with CNNs John Roberts , Paul said of Limbaugh ,  He is a leader .
He does say the right things now and I think a lot of people like to hear what hes saying but I think its also a little bit polarizing and confrontational and I think thats why the Democrats are bragging that Limbaugh now speaks for the Republicans so I guess the Democrats think its to their advantage if hes leading the charge . 
Responding to a question from Roberts on what it means for the Republican Party that their spokesperson is a radio talk show host and not a member of the political leadership , Paul said ,  I think its pretty sad .
It s a good point to make .
That means the Republicans are really starving for some type of leadership . 
A 2008 presidential contender , Paul was a dark horse candidate for the Republican nomination .
His advocacy against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as his criticisms of infringements on civil liberties under the Bush administration have often put him at odds with the majority of his party but have also led to strong support from civil libertarians .
 He really doesnt broaden the base ,  said Paul of Limbaugh .
 It s still very narrow and that s why some of us would like to see an approach that would emphasize personal liberties , civil liberties , looking at the drug war It s really the old Republican Party because even Limbaugh was a big supporter of Bush so he doesnt have anything new either when it comes to bringing our troops homes , not expanding the war in Afghanistan ..
In criticizing Limbaugh , Paul joins Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele , who also had some unflattering remarks to say about the popular talk show host .
 Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer ,  Steele said to CNN's D.L. Hughley on Saturday .
 Rush Limbaugh , his whole thing is entertainment .
Yes its incendiary , yes its ugly . 
Said Roberts of Paul ,  I was fascinated that in terms of expanding the base , Ron Paul is bringing a lot of young people in the door .
It s fascinating .
This 72 - year - old white guy from Texas is bringing a lot of young people in . 
Paul demurred though to Roberts enquiries of whether he would run for president in 2012 .
 I dont think so .
It s a long way off .
I can hardly imagine what [ state ] the country is is going to be in .
Right now I just plan on promoting the cause .

Man :
It 's been ages .
What 's up ?
Man : Nothing new ... same old job .
Same old spouse .
Same house .
Just the old same old .
Man : $*#! Showoff .
Woman :
He just had to rub our faces in it .
Everybody has a mother , and they all die .
Mine did ; yours will too .
When she does –if she has n’t already – you ’ll be sorely tempted to make sense of what has happened .
Ten years ago , a few years after my mother died , I asked my grandmother for some of my mother ’s letters so I could write about her life .
A book - loving woman , my grandmother nonetheless frowned .
“ Oh , I see , ” she said , her lips curling inward in what I recognized as quiet fury .
“ You want to make a story of it . ”
But I did n’t .
Stories require faith , and I do n’t have any .
My mother raised me unreligious in as many churches as we had friends .
We went to Methodist to hear Roger the bachelor sing , to Episcopalian to listen to Shersti the Swede sing , to Dutch Reformed to watch our neighbor , Mr. Nelson , direct bell ringers , and to St. John the Evangelist cathedral across the river for Christmas Eve Midnight Mass .
Since my father is Jewish but did n’t know much about it and lived somewhere else besides , my mother took the Jewish holidays as her own as well .
For a year when I was little she let a Buddhist named Veena live in the attic , and near the end of her life she invited Charismatic Christians in to pray .
Around that time my granny drove up from Tennessee to take care of her dying daughter , and she brought her own gods , as many as would fit in her Buick : the Pentecostal Holiness god of her childhood , the singular Knoxville , Tennessee Christ ’s Church of her age , and the spirits of the books she held dear , Doesteovsky ’s pagan Russian Orthodox , Thomas Merton ’s meditative lord , the bending willows of the Tao Te -Ching .
Surrounded by faiths , I had none at all .
When my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer , when she was 44 and I was 13 , I sat mute in the churches we attended with increasing frequency .
I did n’t know how to pray , not even for my mother ’s life .
By the time I began to learn , it was too late .
All I could think to pray for was an end to the pain , hers and mine .
Before she died , while she was dying –disappearing for long spells to have her skin drawn on like parchment and blasted with radiation , to cling to an IV as if it were a burning rope and she a drowning woman , to have the marrow of her bones sucked out by long needles and replaced with fresh cells that quickly withered –I ’d lie in my bedroom and follow the yellow vines adorning the wallpaper up to the blank ceiling and stare , trying to see God .
“ Please , ” I ’d say .
“ Let my mother die . ”
Useless prayers , they seem to me now ; but then , in the 13 years since she died , I still have n’t found any of the faiths she wanted me to have , the belief that calms you like the hand of the lord .
The summer after she died , I sorted through the boxes of her papers she left behind : her half - finished stories , her abandoned novels , her never - sent letters , her journals , her poems , her patched - together prayers , thinking I might find the beginning of faith there .
Instead I found fragments such as these :
Undated , from a letter about her treatment :
For about two days I was disoriented .
No sense of time , no distinction between reality and fantasy .
And I would clutch at the cloth on the bed , thinking it was my skin and wondering why it was so rough .
Three months before she died .
This body , bound in skin and downy hair , is shuddering , weeping .
It breathes and whispers a thank you with each breath .
It likes to walk fast and break into a run .
It likes to be giddy .
It likes the mysterious warm tingle of red wine on a dark winter night , the startle of fragrance when an orange is cut .
It likes the smack of cold winter air .
It likes to sweat .
It likes to float in the water then dive , pretending it is a porpoise .
It likes to dance until it is the music .

My mother drowned lying in her own bed .
She died in her room on the second floor of the house in which I ’d always lived and that she and I shared alone for the last year of her life .
She was 47 , I was 16 .
Her last breath was of water –fluid had filled her lungs , to which her cancer had spread from her breast and her skin .
My last glimpse of her I stole from my granny , who that morning while we waited for the hearse forbid me from looking at her daughter ’s corpse , her sweet Nancy now gone .
But out of duty and to repent for wishing her dead I snuck upstairs to the room she had died in and closed the door behind me .
She lay in her bed , half - covered by blankets .
It was quiet , my quiet and hers , so calm I could n’t bring myself to say goodbye .
She would n’t have heard .
Not because she was dead , but because , Jesus , she died hard : her mouth open and dark , her lips pale and curved in to cover her teeth , her thick cheekbones worn thin like knives about to tear through her skin .
Her eyelids had been shut by my granny ’s hand but what they hid I could n’t guess , there was nothing under them , as if her eyes had sunk deep down into her in one last bid to not see death .
When those prayer ladies came to save her before she died , I thought , she tricked them .
They said “ pray for your soul , ” but she made them pray for her life .
They prayed .
She died .
Her spine arched up like she ’d have jolted out of bed if were n’t for her arms , thick and shapeless , swelled to bursting from radiation .
I wanted to slip my own skinny arms beneath her and lift her up high as the morning light , coming on white and soft through the winter clouds .
But the longer I looked the darker it got .
That ’s not my mother , I thought , and a second later I knew I ’d betrayed her more thinking those words than I had wishing her dead .
But all I saw was her mouth , gaping : filled with darkness , an empty universe within a corpse .
“ That ’s my mother , ” I said .
*
I believe in my mother ’s body–her corpse–more surely than I believe in God .
Of course , it ’s not exactly original to build a theology on a dead body .
The Christianity my mother fled from and was drawn to is at its heart morbid : alive , and transfixed by death .
The Christian savior redeems his followers with the flow of his own blood .
Catholics celebrate their redemption by eating his flesh .
Less inclined to beat around the bush , a small tribe in central Africa used to believe in eating the dead bodies of their beloved .
Otherwise , they thought , the corpses would cause them to mourn forever .
We buried my mother a few miles from a home .
A somewhat soulless cemetery , ecumenical , well - mowed , each grave capped by a stone of uniform shape and size .
Hers is several yards up a hill from a landscaped stream .
A modest rectangle set flat in the ground .
I stare at it , looking not for her body but for the world it once contained .
But that ’s the tricky thing about the stones we set over graves–only once a millenium do they get rolled away .
For the rest of us , they ’re walls between now and then .
Now : undeniable belief .
Death will happen .
Then : incomprehensible love .
How could it end ?
For answers , you have to look somewhere in between .
Years after my mother died , I decided to read her medical records .
There I thought I ’d find the most precise evocation of her fate : the facts of her death , the hows and whys that stand independent of stories and dreams .
So I asked my sister , Jocelyn , who ’d been named executor of the estate , to obtain them for me .
Doing so was n’t easy .
At first my mother ’s doctor ’s office fell back on confidentiality .
That such facts were secrets presented a clue : a sign that they were not facts at all , but forbidden knowledge , stories none but a doctor could understand .
Still , I grew more determined to have the records , which in my mind had metamorphosed into a manuscript .
I must have underestimated the power of such details .
The records would reveal not only results but also calculations : Dosages of medicines multiplied by careful counts of red blood cells ; the tumors that killed her known not only by names but by measurements ; the width and depth of her disease a record of its age , a number discerned by peeling back layers of exponential growth to its origin , then tracing it back into the present .
One mutant cell gives birth to two daughters , the two are mother to four , the four become forgotten ancestors of billions , a world born within my mother ’s breast .
Not only did the records contain secrets of the disease ’s beginnings and my mother ’s condition — really my mother ’s secrets–but also secrets which in all fairness belonged to the doctors : their estimations of the future .
The prognosis , the prophecy –the story of her death laid out before its event .
We would n’t understand such stories , the doctors warned , and would unjustly turn against those who told them .
We would sue .
We would sue , and we would lose , because before the law the doctors would read aloud the records in voices of reason while we ’d sputter with rage .
The doctors would with authority refer to the “ spirometry ” record of August 21 , 1987 , observe that eight months earlier there had been no palpable lymphadenothapy , and that the white count on that day had been 6,000 .
Spilling papers onto the floor as we struggled to find the same page we the plaintiffs would desperately counter that on December 8 , 1986 , you , Dr. G. , wrote “ Lungs are clear and the heart has a regular rhythm without murmur . ”
How can a dying heart not murmur ?
Yes , of course , we understood that the murmurs of medicine are not the same as those of emotion , but given such clean and lovely words , “ the lungs are clear , the heart has a regular rhythm , ” how is it that the women in possession of such virtues would drown in the fluid of those once - clear lungs , while her heart , calmed by morphine , did not even murmur in its own defense ?
Here the doctors must sigh .
Turn then , to the pathology report recorded by Dr. C. on March 20 , 1986 , for SHARLET , Nancy , born June 28 , 1941 .
Submitted for examination : Two specimens .
1 . The specimen … consists of a… tissue mass measuring approximately 2 cm. in diameter .
On sections approximately half of the parenchyma is represented by ill - circumscribed , firm , pink - tan tumor … .
2 . Received is an elongated piece of skin measuring approximately 1.3 x 0.3 cm. DIAGNOSIS : 1 . Infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast ( left ) .
2 . Fragment of skin showing multiple foci of dermal lymphatic invasion by breast carcinoma .
[ Her skin burned with cancer . ]
Obviously , we obtained the records .
The doctors relented and sent them to Jocelyn , but the odd thing was that I then forgot .
I forgot for months that I ’d wanted them , forgot they even existed .
And I only remembered while crouching on the floor of a library , looking for what I do n’t remember , when my eye fell on a book about fortune telling .
It was a dusty old hardcover and on its spine , embossed in gold , a campy , cartoon gypsy woman wrapped in scarves peered into a crystal ball and for no conscious reason the fact of the medical records that I ’d imagined into being a manuscript came rushing back to me so hard that I literally fell down .
With a thud I rolled off my toes and onto my seat , and then I slapped my forehead , my mouth open in a comic O. Shit .
I ’d forgotten to read the book of secret things .
At the very same moment , I saw in my mind my mother with her green scarf hiding her baldness , my mother the gypsy fortuneteller searching for the number of her days .
When I finally received the documents –not a manuscript at all , just a thick stack of doctors ’ reports , nurses ’ reports , radiologists ’ reports , records of physical exams –I cried at the modesty of the pages .
In their letters to one another about possible treatments her caretakers write cautiously and without clear vision , hopeful but uncertain .
They turned out not to be priests meditating on life and death while my mother was consumed , but technicians with a homely concern for a nice woman with whom their trades had brought them into acquaintance .
“ A pleasant lady , ” observed Dr. G. , her primary physician , on her first meeting with my mother , “ she is very intelligent and she is also very scared . ”
My mother ’s doctors prescribed several cycles of a chemotherapy regimen called CAF , a combination of three drugs : cyclophosphamide , adriamycin , and 5 - flouricil .
Sometimes the drugs made my mother nauseous ; sometimes just thinking about them would make her want to vomit .
She had frequent sore throats , and feared that they signaled the spread of cancer cells into her neck and throughout her body .
Then she woke up one morning and found her thick red hair coming out in bunches on her pillow .
If this upset her , she did n’t let it show .
Instead , she bought herself silk scarves , gold , green , red , purple and turquoise .
She also bought a wig of tight red curls .
I saw the wig for the first time when , at age 14 , I came home from a friend ’s one Saturday afternoon and found it on the dining room table .
At first I did n’t realize what it was .
I picked up the mass of red curls as if I ’d discovered a new species of animal .
Then I laughed ; I was holding a wig !
“ Mom , ” I shouted , not connecting it to her , “ look what I found ! ”
My mother came down the stairs wearing a green scarf wrapped tightly around her head .
She took one look at me holding the wig in the air with a grin on my face and barked a sharp “ Jeffrey ! ”
My name boomed through the house , summoning my sister and snapping my eyes open to the purpose of what I held in my hands .
Jocelyn ran into the room just as our mother demanded the wig .
“ Oh , you idiot ! ” Jocelyn hissed .
But our mother had regained her composure .
She stepped into the kitchen for a moment , then reappeared wearing the red curls atop her head as naturally as the long wavy hair she ’d had most of her life .
That ’s when she announced her nickname to us : “ I , ” she said , “ am Curly . ”
Cautiously I smiled , then Jocelyn relented from her angry face and smiled too .
I grinned , our mother laughed .
“ I ’m not calling you ‘ Curly , ' ” I said .
“ That ’s alright , ” our mother decided .
“ Because I just am . ”

From notes kept by her doctor :
Feb. 17 , 1988 : “ Today the patient has a subcutaneous nodule at the angle of her left jaw . ”
May 9 , 1988 : “ The right breast is entirely replaced by tumor .
She continues to have multiple erythema , one in a necklace distribution . ”
November 8 , 1988 : “ necrotic ”
November 21 , 1988 : “ She is severely short of breath with any exertion , including just speaking . ”

From a letter to one of her doctors :
I tend to pray in the style that I imagine others have prayed .
For some reason I do n’t find it necessary to be exclusive .
I concentrate on Buddhist meditation and Christian prayer .
And sometimes a phrase comes to me that seems addressed to the Great Spirit .
This morning : please keep Nancy - Body together longer .
Let me make a larger pattern .
*
And , as I ’ve said , early on the morning of January 2 , 1989 , she drowned .
Her lungs had filled with fluid and her doctors had emptied them and they ’d filled again , been emptied again , filled again .
And she died .
After I ’d seen the body I walked downstairs .
My granny was in the kitchen trying to explain to my grandfather what had happened .
He was far into Alzheimer ’s then , but that morning was for him one of the worst in the course of his disease .
Every 15 minutes his daughter died anew .
“ Oh , ” he ’d say each time , a word so soft when he said it that it fell from his lips like snow .
Then he ’d forget again , and amble up to someone to ask , “ Say , who ’s that hearse out here for ? ”
I heard Granny in the kitchen – ” Charles .
Nancy is dead .
Nancy our daughter ” –and turned away , into the living room , where my father was standing .
“ I saw , ” I said , but before he could respond the undertakers were at the door , in the hall , at the foot of the stairs , their bodies between ours and the dead one on the second floor , their condolences stringing a tasteful curtain behind which they could do their work .
They carried her down on a stretcher , out the door that my father held and past my granny who whispered , “ Goodbye , Nancy . ”
Then Nancy was gone .
My grandfather saw me crying and asked me what was wrong ; I told him my mother had died .
He thought that was sad , even though he did n’t know who I was , because it ’s a shame when anyone loses a mother .
“ Her name was Nancy , ” I said .
“ I have a daughter named Nancy , too , ” he said , glad to make a connection between us .
“ That ’s who died , ” I told him .
“ Oh , ” he said , and his mouth dropped open .
In the flash of darkness within it before he forgot again and closed it and smiled , I saw the emptiness of my mother ’s body ’s face , so pained and so quiet .
“ Oh – ” I said , because even though her body had gone , there it lay for a moment before me , still lingering in my grandfather ’s eyes despite his now - amiable smile .
When at the funeral I explained to him a dozen times who the woman in the casket was I saw her a dozen times over , each time more the body in the bedroom rather than that which I saw in the coffin with its reconstructed face , its lips pressed together , its eyes brushed shut beneath perfect mascara .

From her journal , undated :
You can , if necessary , keep warm with memory .
In the darkness it gives off silent sparks like a star that falls slowly and disappears .
When you have seen what you need , your sleep will be dreamless .
In the morning , you can start something new .

The really crazy thing is not that some people believe in resurrection , in Christ rising from the grave ; it ’s that anyone does n’t .
Not the Christian resurrection exclusively , but any faith ’s concept of continuity .
Hindu and Buddhist reincarnation , Jewish sparks of the soul , the insanity of the rapture , when , according to born - agains , the dead will rise from the grave just as they were .
I remember , during the months after my mother died , going to sleep on a given night with peace in my heart and the belief that at last I ’d learned to live with her absence , only to awake in the morning with , as my first thought , an incredible frustration : “ Wait–she ’s still gone ?
I thought that was yesterday . ”
Once my mother went on a vacation and wrote a friend a postcard , which she forgot to send .
But she told him about it , and at her funeral , he told me .
“ She said she would have liked it if I could have been on vacation too , so she wrote me a postcard that said , ‘ Wish you were there , and you are . ’
My mother ’s friend laughed .
“ Then she wrote , ‘ See how powerful I am ? ' ”
This is how powerful she was :
One Sunday the summer before she died she took my sister , my friend Andrew , and me on picnic .
We went to Thatcher Park , a strip of grassland with a mountain rising above it and a cliff dropping from its edge .
While the three of us ate my mother sat against a white pine with her eyes closed .
When I asked her what she was doing she said , “ Smelling . ”
So I sniffed the air too : pine needles and tree sap , burgers grilling and farmland far below .
Then she opened her eyes .
“ Let ’s go to the waterfall , ” she said .
We walked with her down a series of metal staircases –each step for her a jarring bolt of pain –to a trail along the base of the cliff .
Andrew and I ran ahead , looking for caves .
Jocelyn stayed with our mother .
Our mother had always moved slowly on hikes , but once she ’d gone from each curious stop to the next with giant steps and swinging arms , her long hair flicked from her eyes .
Now she strolled , an elegance to her gait that disguised the necessity of its caution .
Even as she paused to inspect a mushroom or a gnarled root and declare it especially interesting , she used the moment to gather her wind ; the deep draughts of air she ’d taken under the pine had turned shallow .
But as labored as her movement was , it was a pace , and her progress satisfied her .
She gave Jocelyn leave to go ahead , and despite the red in her face when she joined us at the waterfall she grinned .
We groaned , embarrassed but pleased , as she held her tired arms in the air like a marathon winner .
By then we ’d all taken showers , perched on rocks beneath the thundering column , our heads bowed laughing , our arms held before us , our palms turned up to gather the rushing water .
When she saw us my mother rolled her eyes and called us foolish , but then she ventured closer .
Leaving the safety of the cliff , she stepped onto a boulder then sat down and rested .
Restored she stretched a leg to the next one and with her hands behind her , she pushed herself further .
Like a crab she made her way down until she reached the point of contact between the waterfall and the stone , where the roar and spray and overpowering smell of nitrogen - positive ions , if you believed my mother - confused all the senses ; where you could n’t tell what was up and what was down , whether the water fell from the sky or shot up from the center of the earth .
Shoulders bunched to give herself strength , she poked her finger into the water .
I knew she could n’t stand under the waterfall , but I wondered , if she could have , what she would have made of the water cold as creation washing over her brittle bones .
I did n’t think about faith then , and I do n’t have one now .
And yet : I still wonder what my mother might have told us when she emerged from the stream .
A dying woman granted a glimpse of a moment not frozen , forever recurring anew ; what she might have told us about a place where water meets stone .
( CNN ) --
Part of the power of social networking is the ability to form communities with like - minded individuals .
Attorney Brian Cuban is trying to get Facebook to remove pages for Holocaust denial groups such as this one .
But what happens when those communities are offensive to others ?
That issue is at the heart of attempts by a Dallas , Texas , attorney to have social - networking site Facebook remove pages for Holocaust deniers .
The Holocaust Denial movement seeks to deny or minimize the Holocaust , in which Nazis killed about six million European Jews during World War II .
Attorney Brian Cuban , brother of Dallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban , has been trying since last year to have the pages of groups with such names as " Holocaust : A Series of Lies , " and " Holocaust is a Holohoax " removed from Facebook .
He pointed out that Facebook has removed groups based on complaints before and said the site is " setting the subjective standard on what they remove and what they do n't . "

Facebook hit by phishing attacks for a second day The latest from Facebook : ' Open Stream API '
" There is no First Amendment right to free speech in the private realm , " Cuban said .
" This is n't a freedom - of - speech issue .
Facebook is free to set the standard that they wish . "
Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt said his company is in agreement with Cuban that the Holocaust - denial pages are offensive and objectionable .
Where the two sides part , Schnitt said , is whether people have the right to discuss such ideas on Facebook .
" It 's a difficult decision to make .
We have a lot of internal debate and we bring in experts to talk about it , " Schnitt said .
" Just being offensive or objectionable does n't get it taken off Facebook .
We want it [ the site ] to be a place where people can discuss all kinds of ideas , including controversial ones . "
Schnitt said Facebook has drawn the line with pages or groups that attack an individual or incite or threaten violence .
Schnitt pointed to the recent removal of the " Isle of Man KKK " page , created by residents of the island off the coast of England .
Facebook interpreted the page 's advocacy of " cleansing the island of foreigners " as threatening and inciting violence , he said .
Facebook receives lots of reports about such pages and actively polices the site , Schnitt said .
Last year Facebook removed several pages posted by Italian neo -Nazis after complaints that they encouraged violence against gypsies .
Brian Cuban , who is of Russian Jewish descent , has written about his fight to have the Holocaust - denial pages removed on his site , The Cuban Revolution .
He said he contacted Facebook after a conversation with a friend who runs the Jewish Internet Defense Force , a group that monitors and tries to eradicate anti-Semitic online content .
The Jewish Internet Defense Force , which was successful in removing a Facebook page for the group " Israel Is Not A Country !
Delist It From Facebook As A Country , " is outspoken in its own right and sometimes guilty of sweeping generalizations of its own .
In an article on Brian Cuban 's site published during the 2008 presidential campaign , a representative from the Jewish Internet Defense Force was quoted as saying that " 99.9 percent of Muslims hate us . "
The article went on to quote JIDF spokesman on the last Presidential campaign : " We hope to continue to highlight the issues surrounding [ then - candidate Barack Obama 's ] terrorist connections as well as his racist and anti-Semitic church , which has supported Hamas and the Rev. Louis Farrakhan . "
A Jewish Internet Defense Force spokesperson named David , who requested his last name be withheld because his group has received death threats , said Thursday he would rather people not focus on those specific quotes for several reasons , including the fact that it was an " informal interview " and Cuban " would not let us correct any of our statements after we quickly answered him to help him meet his deadline . "
But on the matter of Facebook and Holocaust deniers , the Jewish Internet Defense Force has a clear stance .
" Facebook should not provide a platform for hatred , especially as it is against their TOS [ terms of service ] , " David said .
" Holocaust denial is illegal in 13 countries and represents a form of Jew hatred and hate speech in general . "
Deborah Lipstadt is the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University and an expert on Holocaust denial .
She said social - networking sites like Facebook are attractive to deniers .
" It allows people to find one another , both for good and for bad , " she said .
" People who are drawn to Holocaust denial tend to be fringe kind of people who might not otherwise be able to find a group , but this way they can find other like - minded people . "
Deborah Lauter , director of Civil Rights for the Anti-Defamation League , said the issue of anti-Semitism and hate speech online is a growing one , partly because of the anonymity the Web offers .
Lauter pointed out that Facebook 's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities says that users " will not post content that is hateful , threatening , pornographic , or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence . "
She said the Anti-Defamation League has worked with sites such as YouTube and MySpace to encourage them to be " socially responsible corporate citizens . "
" Even though in the States this kind of hate is protected speech , [ Web sites ] do n't have to provide the forum to help spread it , " said Lauter , whose organization is the U.S. representative for the International Network Against CyberHate .
" Our position is that if you are going to be providing it , then you have to step up and put in the mechanism for policing it . "

On Feb. 17 , Judge T.S. Ellis added a new twist in the case of two former American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) executives indicted under the 1917 Espionage Act .
In what the Jewish Telegraphic Agency and Secrecy News describe as a major blow to the prosecution , Judge Ellis ruled [ .pdf ] that J. William Leonard can testify on behalf of the defendants when they go to trial on April 21 , 2009 .
Government prosecutors previously argued that since Leonard  a career government employee with expertise in the classification process  had been briefed about the case in 2006 , he could not legally become a witness for the defense .
Rosen and Weissman defense team lawyers expect that Leonard ’s testimony will throw down the gauntlet by saying that the U.S. government “ over - classifies ” information of the type AIPAC lobbyists sought and circulated .
Leonard has examined the national defense information ( NDI ) Rosen and Weissman obtained and is said even to be prepared to testify that the “ back - channel ” practice of disclosing national security information to journalists and lobbyists can actually advance U.S. national security interests .
Leonard is also expected to certify that the NDI released in the AIPAC case was neither closely held nor particularly damaging to the U.S.
More curious still , Judge Ellis believes ( according to his ruling ) that Leonard may even be qualified to opine on whether the defendants could have been in a “ state of mind ” in which they believed their conduct was lawful .
The 1917 Espionage Act is silent on such issues .
The defendants rightly consider Leonard to be their “ most important and irreplaceable ” witness , and jurors will likely be bowled over by his credentials .
Between 1973 and 2002 Leonard was employed by the U.S. Department of Defense as director of security programs and later deputy assistant secretary of defense for security and information operations .
Leonard was charged with developing and monitoring the implementation of policies to stop classified information leaks , investigate leaks , and ensure that NDI was properly classified .
Between 2002 and 2008 , Leonard served as director of the Information Security Oversight Office , the “ classification czar ” responsible for government - wide classification systems .
He now runs his own private consultancy .
AIPAC could have found no better friend than Leonard to gently advise the jury to “ move along , there ’s nothing to see here . ”
If that occurs , America may witness the final stage in AIPAC ’s long - term drive to essentially declassify or classify U.S. government secrets at will  a potentially dangerous threat to the rule of law in America .
If this seems a bit over - the - top , consider two prior incidents .
In 1962 AIPAC ’s predecessor organization  the American Zionist Council ( AZC )  ran into trouble when Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered it to register as Israel ’s foreign agent under the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) .
The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) discovered the AZC had secretly received the equivalent of $ 35 million in Israeli funds to build a domestic lobby and conduct public relations in the United States for arms , aid , and preferential diplomatic treatment .
In a massive but secret battle with the DOJ , the AZC managed to win two important concessions .
The AZC was allowed to file a partial activity declaration covering only three months rather than the many years during which it was most actively lobbying for Israel .
The DOJ also accepted  at the AZC ’s insistence  that its declaration of the names of recipients receiving payments from Israel be kept secret rather than be open for public inspection as all FARA declarations normally are .
This allowed the AZC to quietly shut down operations and reorganize lobbying activities within AIPAC .
The typed statement of Israeli - financed payments to major U.S. scholars , New York Times media personalities , and an assortment of other recipients was only declassified in 2008 .
In effect , the government classification won by the AZC preserved AIPAC ’s reputation , thereby ensuring the Israel lobby ’s uninterrupted rise even after the FARA order .
Although this may now seem only an esoteric historical point , the classification paved the way for even greater AIPAC and Israeli transgressions .
In 1983 , Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and AIPAC lobbied the Reagan administration for preferential Israeli access to the U.S. market .
On Jan. 31 , 1984 , U.S. Trade Representative ( USTR ) William E. Brock commissioned the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) to “ conduct an investigation and to advise the president as to the probable economic effect of providing duty - free treatment for imports from Israel on industries in the United States . ”
But rather than move the two states closer to true free trade , the trade negotiations mangled the rights of American businesses .
U.S. industry groups were alerted via the Federal Register about the proposed trade agreement and urged to provide written comments and / or appear at public hearings .
The ITC compiled reams of “ business confidential ” information about market share and trade secrets from highly concerned U.S. corporations and industry associations into a classified 300 + page report that it transmitted to the USTR for use in negotiating the deal on May 30 , 1984 .
Only 15 numbered and carefully circulated copies were ever printed , but on Aug. 3 , 1984 , the Washington Post broke the news that the FBI was investigating how AIPAC obtained a copy .
The ITC later confirmed the secret report was also held by the Israeli government .
Israel subsequently leveraged the highly sensitive inside information from U.S. companies and associations most affected by the pending agreement against them .
According to the Washington Post , “ a spokesman for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , the principal pro-Israel lobbying group in this country , acknowledged that the organization had a copy of the report but said the lobbying group did nothing illegal . ”
There is no lingering doubt about the sensitivity of the trade report obtained by AIPAC and Israel  an attempt to declassify it under the Freedom of Information Act was denied on “ national security ” grounds , among other reasons , late in 2008 .
The consequences of the alleged AIPAC espionage now on its way to trial could have been far worse .
We now know that Israel solicited American approval to attack Iran over its civilian nuclear program and sought both overflight rights and advanced munitions from the United States .
Both requests were denied on the basis of U.S. national security interests .
If Rosen and Weissman ’s parallel intelligence - collection project had gone undetected and actually succeeded  the FBI was investigating their movements since at least 1999  AIPAC might have been able to leverage the NDI through press , pressure , and propaganda into permission for Israeli or even U.S. strikes against Iran .
Perhaps with J. William Leonard in tow , AIPAC ’s abuse of national defense secrets will succeed the next time around .
But the fallout from attacking yet another country on false pretexts is unfathomable .
This is why Americans observing mainstream pundits and assorted ideologues trumpeting the current course of the long - delayed AIPAC espionage trial as a victory for freedom of the press should ponder this : is it really in our best interests that Israel and its American lobby be empowered to classify or declassify American secrets at their whim ?
Humans have been using cannabis for thousands of years for medical treatments , spiritual purposes , textile manufacturing , and other reasons .
In recent history , chemists have isolated many cannabinoids , the metabolites in cannabis sativa , and have described some of their biological activities .
For example , some cannabinoids have potent effects on multidrug resistant bacteria and others are effective against pain .
The structures of known cannabinoids also inspire chemists to create synthetic chemicals to mimic certain aspects of their function , like pain reduction , while providing a powerful medical effect and avoiding negative side effects .
Although a lot of work that has been done on cannabis , scientists have not identified every cannabinoid , so many research groups are continuing to identify and categorize the chemicals in cannabis .
Samir Ross from the University of Mississippi led one such group in the discovery of nine new cannabinoids , and they published the structures and biological activities of these chemicals in an advanced article in the Journal of Natural Products .
The researchers grew plants from high - potency Mexican C. sativa seeds and harvested the whole buds of mature female plants .
They performed chemical extraction and purification procedures on the plant material to isolate the nine cannabinoids .
They then determined the molecular structures of these new chemicals using a variety of techniques , including 1D and 2D NMR , UV , and HRESIMS ( high resolution electron spray ionization mass spectra ) .
After figuring out the chemical structures , it was crucial to know how useful these molecules might be in terms of medicinal properties .
The first good news was that none of the cannabinoids were toxic to cells extracted from African green monkey kidneys , which meant that they have potential as drugs .
Upon closer inspection , several of the compounds had respectable biological activities , as well .
Compound 5 had potent antileishmanial activity , which makes it a possible candidate against leishmaniasis , a parasitic disease that is spread by the bite of the sandfly .
Compound 8 was effective at killing Staphylococcus aureus , a frequent cause of staph infections , and compound 7 had good activity against Candida albicans , a fungus that gives people oral and genital infections .
The other cannabinoids were n’t as biologically active , but they all had some drug potential .
For insistence , compounds 2 and 6 were mildly affective against MRSA , and compound 1 had some antimalarial activity .
The identification of these biologically relevant cannabinoids will give natural product chemists new ideas for future drugs .
Even the less active ones can turn out to be useful , as chemists can make modifications of the structures that are more potent .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Canada ’s oil sands emit more carbon dioxide than average crude so developers need a clearer picture of where greenhouse gas regulations are headed to find the best way to tap the giant resource , experts said .
“ The future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and Canada will influence the pace of development , ” of the oil sands , said James Burkhard , an analyst at the energy consultants Cambridge Energy Research Associates , Inc .
“ Clarity on carbon regulation in both Canada and the United States would help regulators and investors to make decisions . ”
The U.S. House of Representatives has begun debating a climate bill that could regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from economy - wide sources .
The United States is the largest consumer of oil exports from Canada , which is developing its own federal policy .
Green groups , church leaders and some scientists have slammed the oil sands , the largest deposit of crude outside Saudi Arabia , for polluting water and air .
Greenhouse gas emissions of the oil sands have come into focus especially because developers must blast the gooey crude with large amounts of energy - intensive steam to separate the oil from sand .
They burn large amounts of natural gas , emitting volumes of carbon dioxide in the process .
A CERA report on the oil sands released on Monday found that the resource emits about 5 percent to 15 percent more carbon dioxide , over the “ well - to - wheels ” lifetime analysis of the fuel , than average crude oil .
Burkhard said drilling conventional oil also can emit large amounts of carbon dioxide as traditional oil fields age .
Young oil fields generally are easy to pump as gas within the field pushes out the fuel .
But after years of drilling a conventional oil field , companies must pump more water or steam into it to keep output high .
This can quickly boost the amount of carbon dioxide the drilling process emits .
Oil sands developers are getting more efficient in producing the tarry crude .
Burkhard said they use far less steam than they did just eight years ago .
They are also learning how to use solvents to ease the flow of crude to the well head .
It is also more expensive to melt crude from the oil sands , and developers need a crude price of at least $ 50 a barrel to make a profit .
“ We are still going up the learning curve in improving efficiency of oil sands , ” because production of the resource is comparatively young compared to traditional oil drilling , said Burkhard .
Producers would still be forced to deal with emissions under climate regulation and could either buy permits to pollute or invest in clean energy projects , also known as offsets , under any cap and trade plan .
As well as offering some splendid desktops – the image above is from one of them – the Stalin Versus Martians chaps have been busy .
In a cultural alliance between creative beings of a similar artistic muse , the game will feature the video of the Gogol Bordello - meets - Teutonic - metal of ANJ song “ Gorbachev ” .
You ’ll find the video beneath the cut .
You ’ll want to watch it .
At this point some serious , hard - working game developers who release a stream of fascinating information about the intricacies of their game mechanics and technology may be wondering if they ’d get better results in terms of getting their game covered on RPS by just doing the most ridiculous thing they can think of .
Yes .
The answer is yes .

Updated 11 March : Infrared observations of 2009 DD45 suggest it is a member of a class of rocky asteroids called “ S - type ” .
Based on the average surface brightness of these asteroids , DD45 ’s size appears to be about 19 km across , on the lower end of its estimated size range .
Its size and stony makeup suggest it would break up high in Earth ’s atmosphere if it were ever found on a collision course with Earth , and would not cause damage on the ground , says NASA ’s David Morrison in an email newsletter .
An asteroid about the size of the one that levelled the forest in Tunguska , Siberia , a century ago flew past Earth on Monday – well within the Moon ’s orbit .
The risk of a future impact with the object is not yet known .

The asteroid , dubbed 2009 DD45 , whizzed just 72,000 kilometres above the Earth ’s surface .
That is less than a fifth of the distance to the Moon and just twice the distance to geosynchronous satellites .
The object was first reported on Saturday by members of the Siding Spring Survey , a near - Earth object search programme based in Australia .
Based on its brightness , the asteroid seems to be between 20 and 50 metres across , says Timothy Spahr of the International Astronomical Union ’s Minor Planet Center .
That rivals the size of the asteroid , estimated to be as small as 30 metres , that slammed into Tunguska , Siberia in 1908 , creating a powerful blast that levelled 2000 square kilometres of forest .
Spotted in advance
Astronomers hope to get a better estimate of DD45 ’s span by observing it at infrared wavelengths to estimate how well the rock reflects light .
By modelling the rock ’s orbit over the coming days , astronomers also hope to have a better sense of the threat it may pose to Earth in the next 100 years or so , Spahr told New Scientist .
DD45 seems to orbit the Sun once every 1.5 years .
Some 6100 objects have been discovered passing within 1.3 astronomical units ( AU ) of Earth ( 1 AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun ) .
Of those , more than 1000 have been classified as potentially hazardous , because they pass within 0.05 AU of Earth .
DD45 , which passed just 0.00048 AU from Earth , is one of a growing list of potentially hazardous asteroids that have been spotted by astronomers in advance of their closest approach .
Scanning the skies
In October 2008 , astronomers spotted the first space rock on a certain collision course with Earth .
Pieces of the asteroid , which seems to have measured no more than 5 metres across , were recently recovered in Sudan .
The closest observed asteroid to pass Earth so far has been 2004 FU162 , a 5 - to 10 - metre rock that skimmed by Earth in 2004 , flying just 6500 kilometres above the surface .
NASA aims to discover at least 90 % of near - Earth objects that span a kilometre or more .
But since smaller objects can also pack a punch , some argue that NASA must do more to identify threatening asteroids as small as 140 metres .

Rush On Jeb Bush , Romney : They " Hate " And " Despise " Palin
Discussing the Republican listening tour conducted by Former Governors Jeb Bush ( FL ) and Mitt Romney ( MA ) , radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said they are " embarrassed " by Sarah Palin .
Limbaugh said the underlying issue of these speaking engagements is that Bush and Romney " hate " and " despise " the Alaska Governor and former running - mate of John McCain .
Limbaugh added they have " presidential perspirations " and called their tour an " early campaign event . "
Limbaugh defended Palin and heralded her as the " most prominent and articulate voice " for conservatism .
Rush concluded this " need to praise " President Obama leaves him " wanting . "

NEWTON , Iowa ( CNN ) -- President Obama marked Earth Day Wednesday by announcing a new initiative to lease federal waters for the purpose of generating electricity from wind and ocean currents .
President Obama unveils a new energy initiative Wednesday in Newton , Iowa .
The president announced the initiative , to be administered by the Interior Department , while reiterating his pledge to push for a comprehensive energy plan that encourages the development of alternative fuel sources , cuts dependence on foreign oil , addresses climate change , and creates new jobs .
Wind power can generate 20 percent of the country 's electricity by 2030 and support 250,000 jobs , Obama said during a visit to a wind turbine tower manufacturing plant .
It is part of " beginning a new era of energy exploration , " he said .
Contrary to the assertion of some critics , the country does not have to choose between protecting the environment and expanding the economy , Obama said .
The real choice is between " prosperity and decline . "
Watch Obama discuss the energy plan »
CNN National Report Card
You elected them , now grade them with CNN !
Rate the president , congress and your state leaders .
Wednesday , April 29th at 8 ET see full schedule »
The president said there is no " silver bullet " to solving the country 's energy needs , and that a variety of energy sources will be required to reduce dependence on fossil fuels .
The United States needs to boost domestic production of oil and natural gas in the short term before fully transitioning to alternative sources , Obama said .
But over the long term , new energy sources will be required both to address the issue of climate change and strengthen the economy , he said .
Meanwhile , Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday that $ 300 million in stimulus money will be given to state and local governments to help expand the number of clean and sustainable vehicles in cities around the nation .
The program is called the Clean Cities Alternative Fuel and Advanced Technology Vehicles Pilot Program .
" Every day is Earth Day , " said Biden at a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority training facility in Landover , Maryland , where he announced the program .
The plan , according to Biden , would help local governments and transportation authorities invest in clean vehicles and fund the fueling infrastructure to support them .
" From advanced battery cars to hybrid - electric city buses , we 're going put Recovery
Act dollars to work deploying cleaner , greener vehicles in cities and towns across the nation that will cut costs , reduce pollution and create the jobs that will drive our economic recovery , " Biden said in a statement .
The funding adds to $ 11 billion already allocated to the Department of Energy to boost local energy efficiency programs and weatherize low - income homes .
To participate , local governments have to apply to the Clean Cities Program for funding , and they can receive money for a variety of hybrid vehicles and alternative fuels .

It is a common misconception among foreigners who come to Japan that the people wearing white cotton face masks on the streets are sheltering from pollution .
In fact , they are usually performing a public service by trying to keep their cold germs to themselves .
Face masks are one of the most visible examples of the Japanese obsession with battling baikin or germs which , as the mercury rises at this time of year , goes into overdrive .
It has been the hottest May on record in Japan and with the heat comes a national fear of smells and infection bordering on the obsessive .
A breeding ground for germs
The dreaded bacteria , such as E.coli , emerge in the summer
This is not unusual .
She was cleansing the taps of the touch of her hands which were technically speaking dirty when she started washing .
Of course the quick splash is hardly likely to disinfect the taps but the gesture is meant to demonstrate her consideration for the next user .
Summer brings back the dreaded baikin with a vengeance .
Japan is not only hot in summer it is very humid , the perfect breeding ground for bacteria real or imagined .
There are real reasons to be afraid .
Japan has seen huge outbreaks of E. coli a vicious bacteria which causes fatal food poisoning .
A notorious case in which a woman poisoned a curry at a summer festival , killing four and sickening 60 others has also made the Japanese wary of the safety of everything they touch and eat .
Disinfectants , bleaches , extra strong detergents are all best sellers in summer .
Germ - free money
A new meaning to money laundering
One bank even sanitises the banknotes by heating them .
Crisp clean notes spew out of its machines to its hygiene - conscious customers .
It brings a whole new meaning to money laundering .
There are also pencils , pens , stationery , bicycle handlebars , musical instruments and karaoke microphones all made of anti-bacterial plastic .
These products and services particularly appeal to young women who are leaders of fastidious fashions .
They say they do not want to touch things handled by middle - aged men .
That is why you see women strap - hanging on trains using a handkerchief to protect their hands from the residual sweat of the previous passenger .
Fighting body odour
Women shy away from anything handled by middle - aged men
But do n't worry .
There are thousands of ways to make sure no one will be able to sniff your presence .
There is the usual deodorant of course , but there are also disposable underarm towels in handy hand bag sized packages to soak up unsightly perspiration .
And for really serious cases there is underwear impregnated with chemicals that will deodorise your sweat for 24 hours .
The 100 % cotton vests , briefs and boxer shorts can be washed 100 times and still be effective .
Most of the underwear is aimed at middle - aged men , those same creatures that young women find so unhygienic .
Breath fresheners are also big in Japan .
No one these days would be caught dead without a tiny box of fresh minty lozenges .
My favourite type are peach - flavoured papers that melt in your mouth .
They are aimed at young women with olfactory overdrive and in design they resemble the oil - absorbing papers that all self - respecting office ladies carry to keep their noses from shining in the heat .
Garlic for lunch no problem .
There 's a special tea sold in cans which will kill the lingering odour .
You can even buy non-smelling garlic , allegedly it tastes the same but your breath is as sweet as a rose afterwards .
Deodorising pills
But some ultra-smell sensitive people are going one step further .
They are taking pills that work internally to deodorise all the bodily functions .
Wave goodbye to halitosis , BO and bathroom smells just by popping a simple pill .
Made from six substances extracted from mushrooms , the leading brand is hugely profitable .
Eating the mushrooms themselves sadly does not work .
But in what may be a real service to the planet , there is a version to give to household pets as well .
In Possible Rebuke to Obama , Mexico ’s Ambassador Said an End to Marijuana Prohibition “ Needs to Be Taken Seriously ”
( Washington , D.C. )
With President Obama leaving for talks with Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Thursday , marijuana policy reformers are wondering if the role of U.S. marijuana laws in subsidizing vicious Mexican drug gangs will get the serious attention that Mexico ’s ambassador to the U.S. recently said it deserves .
Obama ’s visit comes immediately after Mexico ’s Congress held a historic debate on ending marijuana prohibition .
“ In his only public statement on the issue since taking office , President Obama treated the question of ending marijuana prohibition as a joke , but the families of the 7,000 murdered by Mexican drug gangs know it ’s not funny , ” said Marijuana Policy Project executive director Rob Kampia .
“ By refusing to bring the massive marijuana industry out of the shadows and regulate it as we do beer , wine and liquor , we ’ve handed a massive subsidy to some of the most brutal thugs on the planet . ”
In an April 12 discussion of Mexico ’s brutal drug cartels on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation , ” Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan was asked by host Bob Schieffer , “ What if marijuana were legalized ?
Would that change this situation ? ”
Rather than dismissing the idea as President Obama did in his recent online town hall meeting , Sarukhan said , “ This is a debate that needs to be taken seriously , that we have to engage in on both sides of the border . ”
“ Ambassador Sarukhan got it exactly right , ” said MPP director of government relations Aaron Houston .
“ The public in both countries is ready for a serious discussion about the marijuana laws that are directly aiding the murderous gangs that are killing people daily and now operate in 230 U.S. cities .
It ’s time for Presidents Obama and Calderon to show the sort of decisive leadership that ’s needed to get both of our countries out of this mess . ”
With more than 27,000 members and 100,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide , the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States .
MPP believes that the best way to minimize the harm associated with marijuana is to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .

I was super - excited this morning , when I saw the announcement that Google had released a Java version of their App Engine environment .
My heart sank a bit when I read that they had a class white - list for security reasons , and told myself that I would n't be surprised if that means that you cant run Server - side JavaScript at all .
However , after reading Ola Bini 's quick article on how to enable JRuby , I felt that it might be doable , after all , JS does n't even have Threads ( which more or less thankfully are disabled in GAE ) .
It _should_ work .
So I went and downloaded the eclipse plugin , created a new project , which came with its own " Hello World " servlet and dropped the Mozilla labs JS version 1.7 jar ( from the Dojo Ajax Toolkit 's util / shrinksafe folder ) into the lib / folder of the GAE project , added some paths here and there -- and it worked .
I tried something really simple like this ;
...
String s = " var foo = { foo : 17 , bar : 4711} ; foo.foo ; " ;
Object result = cx.evaluateString ( scope , s , " " , 1 , null ) ;
resp.getWriter().println(Context.toString(result ) ) ;
...
And out I got a
17
:)
I just saw that Google has limited the Java GAE SDK for the 10 first to register .
I guess Sweden was the right place to be :)

3 . There may be other shoes yet to drop .
Even in the Great Depression , things did n’t head straight down .
There was , in particular , a pause in the plunge about a year and a half in  roughly where we are now .
But then came a series of bank failures on both sides of the Atlantic , combined with some disastrous policy moves as countries tried to defend the dying gold standard , and the world economy fell off another cliff .
Can this happen again ?
Well , commercial real estate is coming apart at the seams , credit card losses are surging and nobody knows yet just how bad things will get in Japan or Eastern Europe .
We probably wo n’t repeat the disaster of 1931 , but it ’s far from certain that the worst is over .
4 . Even when it ’s over , it wo n’t be over .
The 2001 recession officially lasted only eight months , ending in November of that year .
But unemployment kept rising for another year and a half .
The same thing happened after the 1990 - 91 recession .
And there ’s every reason to believe that it will happen this time too .
Do n’t be surprised if unemployment keeps rising right through 2010 .
Why ?
“ V - shaped ” recoveries , in which employment comes roaring back , take place only when there ’s a lot of pent - up demand .
In 1982 , for example , housing was crushed by high interest rates , so when the Fed eased up , home sales surged .
That ’s not what ’s going on this time : today , the economy is depressed , loosely speaking , because we ran up too much debt and built too many shopping malls , and nobody is in the mood for a new burst of spending .
Employment will eventually recover  it always does .
But it probably wo n’t happen fast .
So now that I ’ve got everyone depressed , what ’s the answer ?
Persistence .
History shows that one of the great policy dangers , in the face of a severe economic slump , is premature optimism .
F.D.R. responded to signs of recovery by cutting the Works Progress Administration in half and raising taxes ; the Great Depression promptly returned in full force .
Japan slackened its efforts halfway through its lost decade , ensuring another five years of stagnation .
The Fleur crew were rescued by the Overseas Yellowstone in strong winds
An expedition team which set sail from Plymouth on a 5,000 - mile ( 8,000 km ) carbon emission - free trip to Greenland have been rescued by an oil tanker .
Raoul Surcouf , Richard Spink and skipper Ben Stoddart sent a mayday because they feared for their safety amid winds of 68 mph ( 109 km / h ) .
All three are reportedly exhausted but safe on board the Overseas Yellowstone .
Mr Surcouf , 40 , from Jersey , Mr Spink , 31 , and Mr Stoddart , 43 , from Bristol , are due to arrive in the USA on 8 May .
' Heartfelt thanks '
The team , which left Mount Batten Marina in Plymouth on 19 April in a boat named the Fleur , aimed to rely on sail , solar and man power on a journey to and from the highest point of the Greenland ice cap .
The expedition was followed by up to 40 schools across the UK to promote climate change awareness .
But atrocious weather dogged their journey after 27 April , culminating with the rescue on 1 May after the boat was temporarily capsized three times by the wind .
In one incident Mr Stoddart hit his head and the wind generator and solar panels were ripped from the yacht .
Ben Stoddart was hauled aboard after falling in during the rescue Water was also getting into the boat from waves breaking over it and the crew took refuge in the forward cabin .
The crew were 400 miles ( 644 km ) off the west coast of Ireland when they sent a mayday to Falmouth coastguards who co-ordinated the rescue with Irish coastguards .
The transfer from the Fleur to Overseas Yellowstone was achieved in 42 mph ( 67 km / h ) winds .
Mr Spink and Mr Surcouf were able to jump across to a rope ladder .
But Mr Stoddart fell into the sea , was thrown a line by the crew and hauled aboard .
Team spokeswoman Jess Tombs said : " They are all overwhelmingly relieved to be safe .
" They would like to give heartfelt thanks to the coastguards for their professionalism as well as to the outstanding captain and crew of the Overseas Yellowstone . "

After the Department of Homeland Security ’s report on “ rightwing extremism ” was leaked and posted on Infowars and other alternative news sites , so - called conservatives wasted little time blaming the Obama administration for the report .
A screen capture of the “ Rightwing Extremism ” document ’s properties , revealing it was initially created during the Bush Administration .
However , recent evidence reveals the report has nothing to with the supposed “ Marxist ” ( as Michael Savage and others would have it ) persuasion of the Obama administration .
It is a product created by a government not interested in the artificial divides of the right - left paradigm and concentrates on one primary objective – to demonize and criminalize all effective opposition .
The “ Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment ” document was produced during the Bush administration , as a quick check of the PDF document ’s properties reveals .
It was created on January 23 , 2007 .
In other words , the document is not a reflection of the supposed sinister political coloration of the Obama administration , said by many “ conservatives ” to be socialist or Marxist .
It is a document produced specifically as part of a larger effort to demonize and eliminate all opposition regardless of political persuasion .
An earlier report produced by the Strategic Analysis Group , Homeland Environment and Threat Analysis Division of the DHS concentrated on “ leftwing extremism ” ( Leftwing Extremists Likely to Increase Use of Cyber Attacks over the Coming Decade ) , again demonstrating the government does not hold an ideological bias when it comes demonizing groups and individuals opposed to the government .
The latest DHS report is designed to portray anti-government groups as dangerous and potentially violent terrorists and thus scare off and balkanize supporters .
It also provides the corporate media with an excuse to polarize important issues and dismiss supporters as either misled or as deluded and violent conspiracy theorists .
In particular , some observers claim the report was released and hyped by the corporate media in order to deligitimize Tea Party demonstrations against government spending and taxes held around the country .
For instance , the Huffington Post reports : “ If you think the conservative ‘ Tea Party ’ movement is daunting , take a look at a new report issued by the Department of Homeland Security that says right - wing extremism is on the rise throughout the country . ”
As another example of this dismissal of the Tea Party movement by the corporate media , consider the rather disgusting and juvenile effort by CNN ’s Anderson Cooper ( the Yalie of Vanderbilt lineage who interned for the CIA and may thus be considered a Mockingbird asset ) .
Appearing with David Gergen , a member of the Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg Group ( who has romped at Bohemian Grove ) , Cooper said it is difficult for Republicans to find their voice when they are “ teabagging . ”
The Urban Dictionary defines a “ teabagger ” as “ a person who is unaware that they have said or done something foolish , childlike , noobish , lame , or inconvenient . ”
It is also used to define a pornographic act .
Around the same time the Bush administration ’s DHS produced the “ rightwing extremism ” document , the FBI received a request to work on a similar report .
“ Fox News ’s Catherine Herridge revealed that the report , along with an earlier report on radicalized left - wing groups , was actually ‘ requested by the Bush administration ’ but not completed until recently , ” Think Progress reported on April 15 .
The report , entitled “ White Supremacist Recruitment of Military Personnel since 9/11 , ” begins with an “ intelligence assessment ” claiming “ white supremacist extremist groups have attempted to increase their recruitment of current and former US military personnel . ”
According to the FBI , these “ [ p] ost - 9/11 activities by current or former military personnel involved in the extremist movement span the range of activities engaged in by their extremist compatriots who lack military experience , and include weapons violations , physical violence , paramilitary training , intelligence collection , drug violations , fraud , threats , and arson , ” that is to say all manner of evil and criminal activity .
It is no mistake this “ disgruntled military veteran ” appears in the DHS document .
It is also no mistake the report claims “ white supremacist and violent antigrovernment groups ” present an ominous threat to Obama , primarily due to his race .
The lines separating racist nationalism ( a marginal threat at best ) and opposition to the government are blurred in the document .
The Council on Foreign Relations reiterated the parameters of the DHS and FBI documents on April 21 , 2008 .
A CFR “ bakckgrounder ” entitled “ Militant Extremists in the United States ” touches on both “ rightwing ” and “ leftwing ” extremism covered in the DHS and FBI reports .
The CFR report states :
The September 11 , 2001 , attacks in New York and Washington were the most destructive ever on U.S. soil .
But law - enforcement officials have also long struggled with a range of U.S. - based terrorist groups .
Domestic extremists include hate groups motivated by ultra-conservative ideals that are often anti-Semitic and racially motivated ; ecoterrorists who use violence to campaign for greater environmental responsibility ; and socialist groups who oppose the World Trade Organization .
While homegrown Muslim extremists have proven more lethal in Europe than in the United States , U.S. authorities continue to worry about the prospect of attacks by militant Muslims who are American citizens .
The SPLC and the ADL work closely with the DHS , FBI , and apparently the CFR .
The CFR cites materials provided by the Southern Poverty Law Center in its report .
Prior to the CFR “ backgrounder , ” the Southern Poverty Law Center ’s Intelligence Project issued a report claiming in “ the 10 years since the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people , roughly 60 right - wing terrorist plots have been uncovered in the United States , ” according to U.S. News & World Report .
“ The plots demonstrate that the Department of Homeland Security still needs to closely monitor right - wing groups , says Heidi Beirich , with the Intelligence Project . ”
On March 26 , after Alex Jones exposed the MIAC document , the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC ( ALIPAC ) issued a national advisory to all local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies and officers , along with all DHS Fusion Centers , warning against “ any reliance upon faulty and politicized research issued by the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) and Anti Defamation League ( ADL ) . ”
ALIPAC would like to advise all media sources , law enforcement officers and agencies , that the ADL and SPLC are political organizations , with stated political goals and agendas which are contrary to the candidates , political parties , and millions of Americans besmirched by the MIAC documents .
While both the ADL and SPLC actively market themselves and seek roles as advisers to law enforcement and the media , both groups regularly engage in political tactics like those observed in the now withdrawn Missouri Documents .
Materials from one or both organizations contributed to this scandal .
The ADL and SPLC are notorious for targeting “ rightwing ” groups and individuals while the FBI has a long track record of going after “ leftwing ” groups , as evinced by COINTELPRO ( the CIA also participated in this effort under its Operation CHAOS ) .
The FBI also sponsored so - called “ right - wing vigilantes , ” who were given “ funds and information , so long as they confined their attacks to COINTELPRO targets , ” consisting mostly of anti-war and Black , American Indian , and Chicano “ liberation ” groups .
( see Brian Glick , COINTELPRO Revisited : Spying & Disruption )
The FBI considered the putative “ Militia movement ” so threatening ( primarily due to its constitutional underpinnings ) it orchestrated the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 in order to demonize and criminalize the movement ( and scare off support ) .
A declaration from alleged Timothy McVeigh co-conspirator Terry Nichols , filed in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City in 2007 , reveals McVeigh was taking orders from Larry Potts , a top FBI official .
“ Potts was no stranger to anti-government confrontations , having been the lead FBI agent at Ruby Ridge in 1992 , which led to the shooting death of Vicki Weaver , the wife of separatist Randy Weaver .
Potts also was reportedly involved in the 51 - day siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas in 1993 , which resulted in a fire that killed 81 Branch Davidian followers , ” the Desert Morning News reported on February 22 , 2007 .
The DHS , FBI , and we can assume military intelligence and the CIA ( along with other intelligence agencies ) , are intimately involved in a highly orchestrated effort to demonize and criminalize activists opposed to the government , in particular the patriot movement .
In the corporate media realm – a corporate media long in the orbit of intelligence agencies – this process is limited to propaganda designed to make constitutionalists and patriots look either absurd or dangerous .
The fact the latest document was leaked a few days before the Tea Party demonstrations held around the country is probably not coincidental .
Demonizing and criminalizing the patriot movement – characterizing them as “ rightwing extremists ” and white supremacists with the help of SPLC and ADL propaganda – is a last ditch effort on the part of the globalists and international bankers in control of the government .
Our rulers realize the threat posed by a large grassroots movement – especially one including veterans – demanding less government intrusion in our lives and a return to a constitutionally limited Republic .

“ This will not be a third exit , not in the near term , ” said Roger Ehrenberg , a former investment banker and hedge fund chief executive who now runs IA Capital Partners , his angel investment fund .
“ Just like we ’ve seen a very limited or nonexistent I.P.O. market , it stands to reason that these buyers would be the same kinds of investors , so I ’m not at all convinced that the demand side is even there . ”
For one thing , it could be a thin market , on both sides of the trade .
The Securities and Exchange Commission allows the trading of unregistered securities , but only for select investors .
The new market will be open only to accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers , which the S.E.C. defines as financially sophisticated enough to invest in high - risk securities about which there is little public information .
These include individuals whose net worth exceeds $ 1 million and institutions that manage at least $ 100 million in securities .
Even if individual shareholders and venture capitalists do trade on the exchange , it will be hard for it to grow , Mr. Ehrenberg said .
There is only a small universe of such wealthy , risk - tolerant investors , he said , and companies are limited to 500 shareholders before they have to file with the S.E.C. as if they were public .
“ For this market to really develop real liquidity , that rule needs to be changed , but right now , the government needs to do the exact opposite , ” Mr. Ehrenberg said .
“ They do n’t want more people to buy illiquid , unregistered investments  they want maximum transparency . ”
As in the public markets , investors will determine how much a company is worth , but with much less information than they have for public companies .
SecondMarket will gather public data for buyers and sellers , and companies can choose to submit detailed information that buyers can see .
But it is unlikely that many private companies will reveal much data .
Although the securities are unregistered , fraud may not be a big worry .
SecondMarket says it verifies with the company and its lawyers before any shares change hands .
“ There is no risk that investors wire money and do n’t own the stock or the company does n’t exist , ” Mr. Silbert said .
The public nature of the market may also serve to discourage swindlers .

A teenage schoolgirl was arrested by police for racism after refusing to sit with a group of Asian students because some of them did not speak English .
Codie Stott 's family claim she was forced to spend three - and - a - half hours in a police cell after she was reported by her teachers .

The 14 - year - old - who was released without charge - said it had been a simple matter of commonsense and accused the school and police of an over - the - top reaction .
The incident happened in the same local education authority where a ten - year - old boy was prosecuted earlier this year for calling a schoolfriend racist names in the playground , a move branded by a judge " political correctness gone mad . "
Codie was attending a GCSE science class at Harrop Fold High School in Worsley , Greater Manchester , when the incident happened .
The teenager had not been in school the day before due to a hospital appointment and had missed the start of a project , so the teacher allocated her a group to sit with .
" She said I had to sit there with five Asian pupils , " said Codie yesterday .
" Only one could speak English , so she had to tell that one what to do so she could explain in their language .
Then she sat me with them and said ' Discuss ' . "
According to Codie , the five - four boys and a girl - then began talking in a language she did n't understand , thought to be Urdu , so she went to speak to the teacher .
" I said ' I 'm not being funny , but can I change groups because I can't understand them ? '
But she started shouting and screaming , saying ' It 's racist , you 're going to get done by the police ' . "
Codie said she went outside to calm down where another teacher found her and , after speaking to her class teacher , put her in isolation for the rest of the day .
A complaint was made to a police officer based full - time at the school , and more than a week after the incident on September 26 she was taken to Swinton police station and placed under arrest .
" They told me to take my laces out of my shoes and remove my jewellery , and I had my fingerprints and photograph taken , " said Codie .
" It was awful . "
After questioning on suspicion of committing a section five racial public order offence , her mother Nicola says she was placed in a bare cell for three - and - a - half hours then released without charge .
She only returned to lessons this week and has been put in a different science class .
Yesterday Miss Stott , 37 , a cleaner , said : " Codie was not being racist . "
" The reaction from the school and police is totally over the top and I am furious my daughter had to go through this trauma when all she was saying was common sense . "
" She 'd have been better off not saying anything and getting into trouble for not being able to do the work . "
Miss Stott , who is separated from Codie and her 18 - year - old brother Ashley 's father , lives with her partner Keith Seanor , a 36 - year - old cable layer , in Walkden .
School insiders acknowledge that at least three of the students Codie refused to sit with had recently arrived in this country and spoke little English .
But they say her comments afterwards raised further concerns , for example allegedly referring to the students as " blacks " - something she denied yesterday .
The school is now investigating exactly what happened before deciding what action - if any - to take against Codie .
Headteacher Dr Antony Edkins said : " An allegation of a serious nature was made concerning a racially motivated remark by one student towards a group of Asian students new to the school and new to the country . "
" We aim to ensure a caring and tolerant attitude towards people and pupils of all ethnic backgrounds and will not stand for racism in any form . "
Fewer than two per cent of pupils at Harrop Fold come from an ethnic minority .
It had the worst GCSE results in the entire Salford LEA last year with just 15 per cent of pupils achieving five good passes including English and maths , a third of the national average .
Since being placed in special measures , Ofsted inspectors say it has improved , not least as a result of Dr Edkins 's " outstanding " leadership .
Salford was at the centre of a storm last April after a ten - year - old boy was hauled before a court for allegedly calling an 11 - year - old mixed race pupil a ' Paki ' and ' Bin Laden ' in a playground argument at a primary school in Irlam .
When the case came before District Judge Jonathan Finestein he said the decision to prosecute showed " how stupid the whole system is getting " .
But was himself fiercely attacked by teaching union leaders for " feeding a pernicious agenda " that aided the BNP .
The prosecution was eventually dropped .
Last night Robert Whelan , deputy director of the Civitas think - tank , said : " It 's obviously common sense that pupils who do n't speak English cause problems for other pupils and for teachers . "
" I 'm sure this sort of thing happens all the time , but it 's a sad reflection on the school if they can't deal with it without involving the police . "
" A lot of these arrests do n't result in prosecutions - they aim is to frighten us into self - censorship until we watch everything we say . "
Greater Manchester Police denied Codie had been kept in a cell but would not comment further .
LEADING scientists last night rejected a new ‘ ethical ’ stem cell technique insisting it would do nothing to annoy fundamentalist Christians .
The new method takes human skin cells and makes them behave like embryonic stem cells in a breakthrough that has disappointed researchers across the globe .
But Professor Henry Brubaker , of the Institute for Studies , said : “ I did not spend eight years at university just to adopt research methods that do not annoy the holy living shit out of the Jesus freaks .
“ I got into this business to take science and rub it in their stupid , medieval , voodoo faces .
“ It always puzzled me why they got so annoyed given that the embryo in question had no brain or nervous system and how to the untrained eye it was impossible to tell if was a human or a sea horse .
“ Nevertheless they would open up their bibles and point to the bits about the sanctity of this and the holiness of that and I ’d point to the bit about how it ’s forbidden to eat cormorants . ”
Professor Brubaker said he and his colleagues liked to play with the tiny embryos and would often use them to act out scenes from the New Testament including the Sermon on the Mount and the feeding of the five thousand .
The professor stressed that stem cells will also have a wide range of clinical uses with the exception of bringing someone back to life after they have been nailed to a cross , ‘ because that ’s just a dangerously insane fairy story ’ .
He added : “ If only I could find some way of manipulating the embryo to make it gay . ”

Although on our diverse planet we have many holidays , Earth Day is quickly becoming my personal favorite .
Perhaps this is because I feel such gratitude for the Earth as my home and want to take care of it with the utmost respect , or perhaps it is because most of the other holidays we have are so “ Earth - unfriendly ” .
Whatever the case may be , I love any celebration that focuses on honoring and healing our beautiful planet .
There are many things that we can do to live out a more “ environmentally friendly ” life and leave a smaller impact on this currently fragile system .
Anything from what we drive or what we eat to what type of home gardening we do and what kinds of products we use to clean our homes with .
So seeing as it is Earth day and it is April , usually a popular month for spring cleaning , I wanted to share with you today some reputable environmentally friendly or “ green ” cleaning product companies .
Today , in the developed countries , we live in a world of abundance and in the year 2009 it is actually not hard to find more and more companies who are supporting the Earth , by producing non-toxic products .
Thus here are 10 companies who are providers of environmentally friendly cleaning supplies .
Now , while some of them still have products that need to be improved on in terms of their health effects on us , today ’s focus is that they are “ green ” and non-toxic for our Earth .
They are listed in random order .
Each of these companies offers a full line of “ green ” home cleaning products and some even more !
So there they are !
Lots of variety to choose the product that works best for your cleaning needs , home or budget .
Most of these are fairly easy to find in stores across North America and some in even other parts of the world .
If you cannot find them in a store near you , many of them can also be purchased online .
However , do not forget that there is immense power and thriftiness in simple baking soda and vinegar , which can safely and effectively pretty much clean the whole house .
For simple home - made cleaning solutions that are both environmentally friendly , safe and effective , check out the following from Loretta ’s Clean & Green , where she offers simple recipes for all sorts of household cleaning .
What is not included in this list are green products from companies that use MLM ( multi - level marketing ) and thus are hard for some to get or lock a person into buying the products .
And for those of you wondering where Clorox Green Works is , let me just tell you that I will take them seriously , when they take the environment seriously and stop producing their other highly toxic lines .
In conclusion , may we remember that making a difference for the Earth should not be saved only for one day .
May we use Earth Day as a reminder and an inspiration to treat our Earth right and live sustainably every day !
And if this is the first time you are thinking of going “ green , ” may this Earth Day mark for you the start of a beautiful journey of making a difference on this precious planet that we call home !
Eli Lilly , the drug company , is expected to agree as soon as Thursday to pay $ 1.4 billion to settle criminal and civil charges that it illegally marketed its blockbuster antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for unauthorized use in patients particularly vulnerable to its risky side effects .
Details of the agreement were provided by people involved in the negotiations .
Among the charges , Lilly has been accused of a scheme stretching for years to persuade doctors to prescribe Zyprexa to two categories of patients  children and the elderly  for whom the drug was not federally approved and in whom its use was especially risky .
In one marketing effort , the company urged geriatricians to use Zyprexa to sedate unruly nursing home patients so as to reduce “ nursing time and effort , ” according to court documents .
Like other antipsychotic drugs , Zyprexa increases the risks of sudden death , heart failure and life - threatening infections like pneumonia in elderly patients with dementia - related psychosis .
The company also pressed doctors to treat disruptive children with Zyprexa , court documents show , even though the medicine ’s tendency to cause severe weight gain and metabolic disorders is particularly pronounced in children .
Over the last decade , Zyprexa ’s use in children has soared .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States will seek to develop high - speed rail nationally , President Barack Obama said on Thursday in emphasizing a broader commitment to U.S. infrastructure investment and a transportation alternative ignored or dismissed by previous administrations but long embraced by Asia and Europe .
“ My high - speed rail proposal will lead to innovations that change the way we travel in America , ” Obama said in announcing the first steps of an ambitious initiative that will tap $ 8 billion in newly available economic stimulus money through 2012 .
Those funds will go to states for upgrading existing passenger rail lines and laying the groundwork for high - speed projects , 10 of which are in various stages of planning in California , the Gulf Coast and other regions .
Amtrak , the national passenger railroad financially supported by the government , also hopes to tap into the stimulus money to improve its heavily traveled line between Boston - New York and Washington .
Amtrak has experienced a boon in ridership in recent years and new political footing after nearly a decade of confrontation with the Bush administration , which once sought to dismantle its operations .
Obama ’s vision clashes with entrenched views of many in government and powerful transport industries about the business prospects of long - haul passenger rail .
The private sector abandoned money losing operations decades ago after the government expanded the U.S. highway system and facilitated the rise of air travel .
Still , he said reviving rail should not be a “ pie - in - the - sky ” proposition .
“ It ’s happening right now .
It ’s been happening for decades .
The problem is it ’s been happening elsewhere , ” Obama said in citing France , Spain and Japan .
“ China , where service began just two years ago , may have more miles of high - speed rail service than any other country just five years from now , ” Obama said .
“ There ’s no reason why we ca n’t do this , ” he added , noting such a system would be cheaper and cleaner than building new highways or adding to an “ overburdened ” aviation system .

FOCUS ON STATES , OBSTACLES
The administration ’s effort focuses on federal and state dollars but private investment could play a key role in accelerating projects , government and rail proponents say .
Obama envisions a network of short and longer - haul corridors of up to 600 miles plied by trains traveling up to 150 miles per hour .
Acela service operated by Amtrak only reaches 150 mph over a short stretch in New England .
Freight railroads , which own much of the rail infrastructure outside the Northeast , would also play a key role in facilitating high - speed .
The biggest freight lines include CSX Corp , Union Pacific Corp , Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp , and Norfolk Southern Corp .
Other companies that could factor in new U.S. rail investment include steelmakers and construction firms as well as locomotive manufacturer and equipment supplier GE Transportation , a unit of General Electric Co ; Canadian locomotive and train car manufacturer , Bombardier , and brake systems maker , Wabtec .
The first grants to states for high - speed projects and upgrades to existing service could be awarded this summer .
High - speed development , according to government and outside experts , will cost substantially more over many years .
Obama proposed an additional $ 5 billion for rail in his budget .
In a study released to coincide with Obama ’s announcement , IBM said that it will take many different sources to overcome many obstacles .
The company , which provides technology for rail systems in Asia and Europe , said some $ 300 billion will be spent around the world over the next five years to build up high - speed rail .
Obama addressed two obstacles , including the shrinking pool of experts needed to work on the rolling stock and track .
Also , with state economies badly bruised by recession , some will have to make difficult decisions to advance these programs .
“ To be competitive in a 21st Century economy , we need a balanced transportation system that allows us to move people , goods and commerce quickly and efficiently -- and that reduces the number of cars on our roads , ” said Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski in a statement .
Oregon is working with Washington and Canada ’s British Columbia on a rail corridor and Kulongoski said his state would apply for a grant once the Transportation Department releases competition guidelines in June .
Rail development has long been a politically charged issue at the federal level due to expense and service to less populated states .
Last year , Congress passed a sweeping train improvement bill and Obama plans to present a more detailed rail development plan in October .

Abstract Cellular phone technology is emerging as an important tool in the effort to provide advanced medical care to the majority of the world population currently without access to such care .
In this study , we show that non-invasive electrical measurements and the use of classifier software can be combined with cellular phone technology to produce inexpensive tissue characterization .
This concept was demonstrated by the use of a Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) classifier to distinguish through the cellular phone between heart and kidney tissue via the non-invasive multi-frequency electrical measurements acquired around the tissues .
After the measurements were performed at a remote site , the raw data were transmitted through the cellular phone to a central computational site and the classifier was applied to the raw data .
The results of the tissue analysis were returned to the remote data measurement site .
The classifiers correctly determined the tissue type with a specificity of over 90 % .
When used for the detection of malignant tumors , classifiers can be designed to produce false positives in order to ensure that no tumors will be missed .
This mode of operation has applications in remote non-invasive tissue diagnostics in situ in the body , in combination with medical imaging , as well as in remote diagnostics of biopsy samples in vitro .

Introduction Telemedicine , the use of telecommunication in medicine , is becoming an increasingly important branch of medicine .
A recent review of different wireless and networking technologies and their use to promote the ultimate goal of global health by means of deployment of a telemedicine paradigm is found in [ 1 ] .
Telemedicine finds applications in almost every aspect of medicine .
For instance , sampling signals from sensors on patients and transmits digital data over a Bluetooth link to a mobile telephone was discussed in [ 2 ] .
The use of wireless technologies , such as wireless LAN and sensor networks , for remote cardiac patient monitoring ( telecardiology ) was discussed in [ 3 ] .
A comprehensive 3G universal mobile telecommunications system ( UMTS ) solution for the delivery of voice , real - time video , ECG signals , and medical scans information from an ambulance to a hospital was presented in [ 4 ] .
The use of medical imaging through a telecommunication network for minimally invasive surgery was introduced in 2004 [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
Recently , our group has expanded on our previous work in telemedicine [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] and introduced the design of a conceptually new device technology in which the data processor site and the data acquisition site are geographically separated , and a cellular phone is used as a conduit of raw and processed data between the two distant sites [ 7 ] .
One possible application of this technology is for the majority of the world population currently without access to medical imaging [ 7 ] .
In another recent paper [ 8 ] , we introduced the use of classifier technology for tissue characterization in X - ray mammography .
Conventional mammography can identify areas of suspicious tissue , and often invasive needle biopsy is used to determine if the suspicious tissue is benign or malignant .
We proposed a new way to characterize the suspicious tissue without the use of needle biopsies .
The method works by combining knowledge of the location and size of the tissue sample of interest from X - ray mammography with multi-frequency electrical measurements made on the breast surface ( in a configuration similar to the mammogram , as in [ 9 ] ) and with Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) classifier techniques .
The classifying capability is due to the fact that malignant tumors have different electrical properties from benign tumors [ 9 ] – [ 14 ] .
The study was theoretical and demonstrated the feasibility of the concept .
In this study , we combine the cellular phone technology of [ 7 ] with the classifier technique of [ 8 ] for a new method of tissue characterization through the cellular phone .
This study has experimental and theoretical aspects .
The main aim of the study is to produce the first experimental demonstration of the feasibility of the theoretical concept introduced in [ 8 ] .
The experimental study was done with tissue samples in vitro .
This particular experimental technique may also have immediate use for the characterization of tissues from biopsies .
Tissue biopsies are a standard diagnostic tool .
In major hospitals , experts in histology can perform the tissue analysis on site , immediately after the biopsies are taken .
However , biopsy samples taken at smaller clinics and by private physicians are usually sent out for histological analysis .
This is a lengthy process which inconveniences patients and increases the cost of the treatment .
The technique shown in this study could be used for biopsy tissue characterization at the site where it is taken , from a distance through the cellular phone .
This paper is presented in two parts .
In the first , we introduce the experimental procedure , the data acquisition device ( DAD ) electrical hardware , and the classifier software and demonstrate how we train the classifier to distinguish between tissue types .
In the second part , we introduce the use of the cellular phone to connect between the DAD at a remote data sampling site and the trained classifier at a central location .
Discussion Classifiers were trained for all 12 electrode configurations so as to be divided into four groups of configurations in accordance with the distances between the electrodes .
It can be seen in Table 2 that the configurations in which the current electrodes and voltage electrodes were closer to each other gave better results .
Since the classifier results for electrodes that are farther away from each other are still above the random score of 50 % , they can be used in order to improve the final classifier .
It can also be seen in Table 2 that although configurations 1 – 4 and configurations 5 – 7 are respectively symmetrical , there are differences in the classifier results .
The combination of several measurements for the final classifier is more stable to noise and produces better results .
More complex methods can be employed , such as giving different weights to different configurations .
For example , closer electrodes ( i.e. , configurations 1 – 4 ) can be given higher weights than farther electrodes ( i.e. , configurations 8 – 10 ) .
This may allow the utilization of more electrodes , such as configurations 8 – 10 , which failed to improve the results and thus were not included in the final classifier .
However , for purposes of this preliminary study , using the majority method seemed sufficient .
Two types of datasets were used for the ex-vivo biological model classifier , one using the amplitude data and the other using the phase data .
It can be seen that both classifiers gave about 90 % correct classification .
We have not tried to optimize the classifier developed here for any particular performance .
However , it should be possible to design a classifier that can be biased to produce only false positive so as not to miss malignant tissue at the expense of a higher level of false positive result .
The classifier based on amplitude measurements yielded slightly better results than that based on phase data , but the database is too small to reach any final conclusions .
The potential advantage in the phase data is its inherent normalization [ 28 ] , rendering it less subject to influence by tumor size , which was less of an issue in this study .
Furthermore , it has been shown that for some tissue types , the main discriminator will be the phase data rather than the magnitude [ 29 ] .
The study presented here has demonstrated the feasibility of the classifier concept for tissue identification using heart and kidney tissue .
These tissues were chosen to demonstrate the concept because they were available from another study and our research strategy is to minimize the use of animals in research .
However , the concept developed in this study is general and is relevant to distinguishing between any types of tissue with different electrical properties in a range of frequencies .
To illustrate this point we bring here tables 3 and 4 .
The tables give the electromagnetic properties of heart and kidney tissue as a function of frequency [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
In addition the table gives the ratio between the properties of the heart and kidney at the same frequency .
Obviously the greater the difference between two tissue properties the easier it is to distinguish between them .
The tables also give the electromagnetic properties of breast carcinoma and breast fibroadenoma [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
An important use of this technique would be to distinguish between a benign and malignant breast tumor from biopsies .
The table shows that the ratio between the electromagnetic properties of these two types of breast tumors is significant and even larger than between heart and kidney .
This suggests that the classifier technique introduced here could be used to distinguish between tissues in clinical situations of importance PPT PowerPoint slide

In our previous work , we suggested using the mammogram image for localizing the tumor and estimating its size .
In this study , the tissues were placed approximately in the center of the Petri dish .
The location of the tissue of interest is important information used by the classifiers .
This information can be provided by X - rays for the classification of tissues and can be obtained visually when tissue samples are placed in a test system , such as in a Petri dish in vitro .
Obviously the technique developed here for tissue characterization with classifiers does not require cellular phone technology .
If a sufficiently powerful computer and data base are available at the patient site the technology can be made self sufficient .
However , the use of the cellular phone provides here , as with medical imaging , other advantages .
The use of cellular phone technology with classifiers is simple and straightforward .
This is particularly important in applications designated for developing areas , where the personnel might be less trained and technical support less available .
Another advantage of using electrical impedance measurements is their relatively low price and robust implementation .
We believe that the separation of the classifier location from the measurement location can help in providing an updated and accurate classifier while benefiting cost , ease and simplicity of use .
A more complete system should receive the new measured data from the remote site and only later ( after a period of several months ) receive the ground truth results .
This can provide a good follow - up mechanism and help in updating and improving the classifier .
Conclusion
In this study , we continued working toward the two goals presented in our previous studies : 1 ) developing a non-invasive method for tissue classification ; and 2 ) using cellular technology in order to make these methods more accessible in developing countries .
The first goal was examined by an ex-vivo biological model .
The results agree with the simulations presented in our previous study and demonstrate with experimental data that using electrical impedance measurements and machine learning methods , such as SVMs , can facilitate good tissue characterization in a non-invasive way .
We have also shown that the combination of electrical impedance measurements with cellular phone technology is feasible and can provide a viable and inexpensive alternative to tissue classification and biopsy analysis in areas of the world that currently have limited access to these types of technologies .

helping those who wo n’t help themselves
How far should we go to help people who refuse to help themselves ?
Or worse yet , whose parents refuse treatment we know will keep them alive ?
illustration by Erik Anderson
Science and skeptic blogs are tracking the story of Daniel Hauser , a 13 year old boy with Hodgkin ’s lymphoma who ’s mother wo n’t allow him to undergo chemotherapy treatments because modern medicine conflicts with the tenants of Nemnhah , her Native American religious tradition .
Instead , she proposes to treat her son with herbs and vitamins mentioned in a variety of internet articles from alternative medicine practitioners .
In doing so , she lowered her son ’s chances of survival from the average 95 % to a dismal and terrifying 5 % according to his oncologist .
Seems that the herbs which were supposed to cure the child will be complicit in his death .
Ideas about curing cancers with vitamins and herbs are nothing new , but what ’s novel about using alternative medicine to treat lymphoma in this case , is a religious justification for doing so .
The First Amendment grants freedom of religion and when you ’re ignoring a recognized religious group , you could technically be infringing on their right to express their beliefs and trigger all sorts of protests and countersuits .
This is why a court order to return Daniel to a hospital where he would be treated by modern medicine and get an immensely better shot at surviving his disease , may get messy and since he was raised into his mother ’s religion , he ’s already refused to obey such an order even if it ’s issued which would nullify any good that could come from it .
Would the judge really order the police to drag Daniel to the hospital , kicking and screaming ?
Is it really the best thing to do when your help will be seen as tyrannical meddling even when sound science and solid fact are firmly on your side ?
How far should we go to help those who need our help but do n’t want if for a completely irrational reason ?
Another big question to consider is whether Colleen Hauser would be liable for her child ’s death by refusing modern treatment .
Courts can , and do , hold parents liable for refusing to help their children get medical care , even when religion is involved .
Appealing to the idea that vitamins , herbs and homeopathic cures were valid medicine might also fall on deaf ears .
In Australia , a couple who treated their baby for eczema with standard homeopathic treatments and refused to seek conventional medical help when those treatments failed and their daughter died of repeated infections , was charged with gross criminal negligence .
It does n’t seem that a U.S. court would consider vitamins and herbs as a legitimate method of treating lymphoma , especially when medical experts say the treatments are doing nothing for the child , in much the same way the aforementioned Australian case has played out so far .
And again , there ’s an issue of whether a court will draw a line in the sand and say that your firm beliefs are n’t valid when someone is about to be harmed by them and society will take over your duties .
How far should we try going to help people who refuse to help themselves and those in their care ?

Python ’s lambda is broken !
Andrej Bauer
I quite like Python for teaching .
And people praise it for the lambda construct which is a bit like $ \lambda$ - abstraction in functional languages .
However , it is broken !
To see how
lambda is broken , try generating a list of functions $ [ f_0 , … , f_9 ] $ where $ f_i(n ) = i + n$ .
First attempt :
>>> fs = [ ( lambda n : i + n ) for i in range ( 10 ) ] >>> fs [ 3 ]
(4) 13
Wait a minute , fs [ 3 ] ( 4 ) ought to be 3 + 4 = 7 !
It looks like all 10 functions share the same “ last ” value of i , which is 9 .
Indeed :
>>> [ f ( 4 ) for f in fs ] [ 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 ]
This is certainly unexpected .
Let us try to get around the problem by not using lambda :
>>> fs = [ ] >>> for i in range ( 10 ) : ... def f( n ) : return i+n ... fs.append(f ) ... >>> [ f ( 4 ) for f in fs ] [ 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 ]
Still not working , so the reason is deeper , probably in the way environments are handled .
Maybe like this :
>>> fs = [ ] >>> for i in range ( 10 ) : ... def f( n , i=i ) : return i+n ... fs.append(f ) ... >>> [ f ( 4 ) for f in fs ] [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ]
Victory !
But try explaining to students what is going on .
Just to be sure , Haskell does the right thing , of course !
Prelude > let fs = [(
-> i + n ) | i <- [ 0..9 ] ]
Prelude > [ f ( 4 ) | f <- fs ] [ 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 ]
What were the implementors of Python thinking ?!
When developing a new system , getting end - to - end functionality and being able to demonstrate it as soon as possible is important .
While doing so , it ’s also an added benefit if you do not spend a lot of time writing throwaway code .
I have a set of scripts that let me test and use the system that I am developing from the command line .
Since the whole system is written in Ruby , writing a script to allow command line interaction is straightforward .
The end result of what I am developing will be a service , so functionality equivalent to the scripts must be available in a browser .
With Ruby , there are several ways to bring an application to a browser .
The usual suspects are Rails , Merb and if they do n’t work , one can always revert to using WEBrick and write servlets .
Rails and Merb did not seem right since I have an existing CouchDB backed model .
I had read about Campingand wanted to test it out so I did .
This was great .
From the time I started investigating Camping until I could show data from my model in the browser took only 45 minutes .
When I realized that I could use my own model directly rather than use the Camping model , I was just a few lines from the goal .
I have n’t given much thought to whether this is a production ready framework , but that does n’t really matter at the moment since I do n’t have to write much unnecessary code .
The benefit of reduced development time while retaining the full programmatic control of my model .
To show how easy it is to connect CouchDB and camping , here ’s a simple example that while not particularly useful on it ’s own should show a pattern that you can use in your own application .
require ' camping ' require ' couchrest ' Camping.goes :MyCamp
I use CouchRest to simplify CouchDB interaction .
The magic is of course in the last line , Camping.goes : MyCamp .
That line tells Camping to serve the module called MyCamp .
Time to implement the controller .
Note that Camping expects to find the controller definitions in MyCamp : : Controllers .
module MyCamp :: Controllers class MyObject < R ' / object /( \w + ) '
This construct might confuse people , but R is defined by Camping and the parameter is a path with a regexp in the parentheses .
This regexp yields the argument to get below .
In this case , any HTTP GET request to server / object / number1 will call get ( ' number1 ' ) .
Perfectly RESTful .
def MyObject.set_storage( storage ) @@storage = storage end
This is a way of letting the controller know the about our CouchRest model .
I could have added a Model encapsulating that , but to me that is just adding another level of indirection that only serves to add confusion and complicate code maintenance since the model already exists .
def get ( id ) @my_object = @@storage.get ( id ) @my_id = id render : mymodel end end end
This is the method that is called by a HTTP GET request matching the pattern given / object / ( \w+ ) .
render : mymodel result in the execution of the mymodel view .
module MyCamp :: Views def mymodel body do h1 " #{@my_id} " ul do @my_object [ ' items ' ] . each do |field , value| li " #{field} : #{value} " end end end end end
Simple view that iterates over the ‘ items ’ hash and lists field : value .
Note that Camping by default uses markaby to create HTML programmatically .
db_url = ' http://localhost:5984/' storage = CouchRest.database (" #{@db_url}objects " )
MyCamp :: Controllers ::MyObject.set_storage(storage )
Sets up CouchRest to use the CouchDB backend at http://localhost:5984/objects
Run you application with
camping my_camp.rb
If the database contains a document with _id = ' number1 ' and ' items ' = { " a " : 1 , " b " : 2} , your browser will show this at http://localhost:3301/object/number1 :
number1
a : 1
b : 2
There you go , a nice little Camping application backed by CouchDB .

Though pundits tend to throw around both terms as if they 're interchangeable , average and median are not the same thing .
If you grabbed nine people off the street and put them in a room with Bill Gates , the average net worth would be in the billions .
But ( unless you made your selections from a very unusual street ) the median worth -- the value that would split the room into two groups of five -- would be much much lower .
We 've all experienced the use of this difference to distort the tax debate , as Republicans use average income to make it seem as if Americans are much richer than the median income would indicate .
As it turns out , the difference between average and median is even more dramatic when looking at how release of carbon into the atmosphere is distributed across America .
( note : since I first worked on this piece several days ago , Reuters has removed the original article from their site .
The link above is to a summary .
The published paper can be found here as a pdf . )
The variation in intensity of carbon emissions is extreme .
Across 1,559 counties with at least 25,000 residents in 2002 , the average carbon emissions per capita was 7.66 tons but with a median of 3.28 tons and a standard deviation of 16.9 tons .
You do n't have to be a big statistics head to realize that when the standard deviation is five times the median value , you have a system that 's not exactly equitable .
Even the map of the data provided by the paper does n't come close to covering the variability .
Notice something about those ranges ?
The range of emission in the high - carbon states is much broader than all the other ranges put together .
Some states produce a lot of carbon .
Others produce a lot .
The data used in the study was not new , it 's the 2002 set produced from the Vulcan Project and is the same source that feeds the spiffy Google Earth carbon viewer .
The fact that carbon production is far from even is n't really the point of the new report from which the blockquote above was taken .
It 's the politics of carbon that are being examined .
Not only do some areas of America pump put much , much more CO2 than others , the location of those high and low carbon areas directly contributes to the political difficulty in getting anything done about restraining the growth in CO2 .
Whether through a carbon tax or a cap - and - trade program , the impact of emissions control and pricing will not be anything like uniform across the United States .
It will result in large distributive consequences and income shifts , hitting some groups far harder than others .
And where are these areas that will take the hardest hit ?
Counties with high emissions per capita are likely to be poorer and represented by a more conservative legislator .
According to the report , " Conservative , poor , rural areas will face a higher carbon bill under a cap and trade system than liberal , rich , urban areas . "
Though the huge populations of cities like Los Angeles turn them into a carbon hotspot ( with half the emissions coming from cars ) , when it comes back to that per person basis , high carbon emissions are really tagged to one thing : coal power plants .
Coal is shipped all over the country by rail , this is especially true of inexpensive coal from the Powder River Basin , most of which is shipped east from Wyoming to states in the Midwest and Southeast .
This is how states such as Florida , which has no coal mines at all , can still produce more than a third of their power from coal .
There are also states that used to be large producers of coal , but whose own mining industry has faded from its peak .
These states have an existing infrastructure of coal - fired power plants , many of which have been adapted to burn the lower BTU western coal .
Missouri , which produced nearly 7 million tons of coal in the 1980s , produces well less than half a million tons today , but 86 % of the state 's power still comes from coal .
Finally , there are the states that have both a legacy of coal fired plants and high levels of production today .
States like Kentucky and Indiana generate more than 90 % of their power from coal .
West Virginia is the champ , with 96 % of the state 's power production coming from coal .
By contrast , California gets only 2 % of its power from coal and New York is 17 % coal - fired .
Vermont draws 0 % coal power ( so does Rhode Island , which uses almost 99 % natural gas ) .
It 's this inequity that 's at the center of the study .
The argument is that these areas will pay the " high cost " of the transition from fossil fuels and mechanisms by which the states that " win " the fight to lower carbon emission can compensate the states that " lose . "
What the report seems to be ignoring is that the costs of the current system go far beyond the relative price of electricity and the diminishing number of jobs in the mining industry .
People are n't trapped in carbon - extraction industries by some law of nature .
They 're trapped by policy and intent .
Areas that are centered on extraction industries are far more likely to be poor exactly because of the nature of these industries .
These are very top heavy businesses that leave behind environmental damage , little to no infrastructure improvements , and a populace whose jobs skills are not easily transported to another industry .
Over the last thirty years , voters in these areas often support conservative politicians because they see these politicians as protective of their jobs .
To support these industries , conservative politicians remove regulation that would improve environmental remediation , reduce taxes that would benefit communities , and drive out unions that would protect worker 's rights .
The result builds a cycle that 's more difficult to stop than a two - pack a day smoking habit .
Areas dependent on extraction industry might as well be mining poverty .
So why do n't the people in these areas break this cycle ?
Because they 're convinced -- with pretty good reason -- that if the carbon economy folds , they 'll be out of work and the rest of the country wo n't lift a finger to help them .
When the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970 , its initial impact on coal came in the form of mandated reductions in sulfur emissions .
Sulfur from Midwestern power plants was spreading acid rain across the eastern half of the country , ruining lakes and killing off whole forests .
The assumption was that to meet the rules coal companies would respond by using more preparation plants to reduce the sulfur in their coal , and power companies in the Midwest would add " scrubbers " to their smokestacks .
But there was a simpler solution : move west .
Coal in several of the Midwest 's largest coal - producing areas tends to be over 2.5 % sulfur .
Coal in Wyoming 's Powder River Basin is less than half a percent sulfur .
Mining companies shifted a larger percentage of their production to western states where coal was easy to mine , low in sulfur -- and located in states whose right to work laws allowed them to smash the union .
Power companies opted for the much cheaper route of adapting their plants for western coal rather than adding scrubbers .
As mine after mine closed , both sides pointed at the government and told workers that their jobs had been lost because of politicians in DC .
And in a very real sense , they were right .
Certainly it was the companies who made the choice on how they would meet the regulations , but if the rest of the nation was concerned about it , they did n't move to stop it .
Why ?
It could be that while the companies had predicted a drastic increase in electricity costs with the Clean Air Act , moving to easily produced coal from large surface operations and opting for the easy out at the power plants actually reduced the cost of electricity over the next twenty years .
What politician was going to say " no fair " when the power bills of their constituents were angling down ?
Stringent regulation for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions will impose different costs across geographical regions .
Low - carbon , environmentalist states , such as California , would bear less of the incidence of such regulation than high - carbon Midwestern states .
Such anticipated costs are likely to influence Congressional voting patterns .
...
In the 111th Congress , the Energy and Commerce Committee consists of members who represent high carbon districts .
These geographical facts suggest that the Obama Administration and the Waxman Committee will face distributional challenges in building a majority voting coalition in favor of internalizing the carbon externality .
Actually , it 's worse than the paper indicates .
There is no benefit that you could offer guys like Mitch McConnell to get him to vote against the industry .
Which is why the first step toward a climate change bill has already been watered down to make it more palatable to to carbon producers .
Even as House Democrats are celebrating their deal with conservative - leaning colleagues on climate change legislation , the real winners under the compromise have been the coal , electric and auto industries , who are largely the source of the nation ’s carbon emissions to begin with .
Details of the compromise are still emerging , but already the chief sponsors of the measure — Reps. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) and Edward Markey ( D - Mass . ) — have been forced to lower carbon - reduction targets , cut renewable fuel standards and dole out billions of dollars in benefits to the nation ’s largest polluting industries .
Singaporean researchers at the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology have devised a way to convert carbon dioxide into clean - burning biofuel methanol , using a safe , non -toxic process .
Has mankind defeated the final boss of Global Warming ?

This scientific discovery was printed in the renowned chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie , who deemed the breakthrough as " very important . "
According to Gizmag , " scientists have been able to make carbon dioxide react with a stable organocatalyst called N - heterocyclic carbene ( NHC ) under mild conditions in dry air . "
After that , a dash of silica and a touch of hydrogen are added in , where the entire mixture is subjected to hydrolysis to produce the methanol .
The most promising part is that this NHC is a supposedly abundant gas .
So here 's hoping we actually see this move past the idea stage .

Amazon has unveiled a new service called AWS Import / Export that is designed to " accelerate moving large amounts of data " to and from Amazon 's S3 cloud - based storage solution .
Only it does n't rely on improved network infrastructure — instead , it relies on the good old fashioned US Postal Service .
Now , the mail is n't exactly known for operating at Internet speeds .
But the problem that arises in transmitting large amounts of data — even as networks become increasingly fast — is that our collective ability to gather data is outpacing the ability to send and receive it over a wire .
" No matter how much we have improved our network throughput in the past 10 years , our datasets have grown faster , and this is likely to be a pattern that will only accelerate in the coming years , " according to Amazon CTO Werner Vogels .
" While the network may improve another order of magnitude in throughput , it is certain that datasets will grow two or more orders of magnitude in the same period of time , " he wrote in his blog last week .
So instead of spending days , weeks , or even months trying to funnel a huge dataset through what might be relatively limited bandwidth , the AWS Import / Export service will allow you to dump your data to an external eSATA or USB 2.0 hard drive and ship it to Amazon for upload to the cloud .
Obviously , if you need to get a huge dataset out of the cloud , the process works in reverse — Amazon will dump your data to a drive and ship it back to you .
Amazon says that any dataset that would take a week or more to transmit over the network should definitely be considered for AWS Import / Export .
The company even provides a helpful table showing the theoretical transfer times for 1TB of data , which gives users a guide of how large a dataset would have to be before shipping it through the mail makes sense .
Available Internet Connection Theoretical Min. Number of Days to Transfer 1TB at 80 % Network Utilization When to Consider AWS Import / Export ? T1 ( 1.544Mbps ) 82 days 100 GB or more 10 Mbps 13 days 600 GB or more T3 ( 44.736 Mbps ) 3 days 2TB or more 100 Mbps 1 to 2 days 5TB or more 1000 Mbps Less than 1 day 60 TB or more
Unless you are a large company or university with dedicated high - bandwidth access that can be completely tuned over to data transfer , though , sending a hard drive in the mail makes a lot of sense .
At 10 Mbps , for instance , it would take 13 days of sustained , maximum bandwidth to move 1TB of data .
Many smaller businesses do n't have that kind of bandwidth to tie up for such a long period .
And if they are on some kind of metered plan , moving that much data would be cost prohibitive .
Despite promises of terabit ethernet and fiber - to - the - premises , we know that even large theoretical bandwidth claims are rarely realized .
Even today , we are just reaching the capacity to make the promise of a basic consumer service like Netflix a reality — for the first 11 years , Netflix relied on the postal service to transmit up to 9GB of data to its users for under a dollar .
Amazon 's AWS Import / Export service provides a reasonablly fast and cost - effective means of transferring ever - expanding collections of data — even if it relies on moving that data via truck , plane , or foot instead of over our near - ubiquitous network connections .

Fans of Lost , Fringe and the new Star Trek may have noticed a couple of recurring themes running through JJ Abrams ' work , making us think that he 's trying to tell us something .
But what ?
Advertisement
JJ Abrams is a time - traveler from a parallel Earth here to prepare us for some kind of upcoming reality shift .
Really , it 's the only solution that makes sense .
Think about it .
Lost has turned into your weekly primer on the rules of time travel and what can , and can't be done by those sailing the silver seas of the chronoverse .
Its creators have spoken before about how they 've had to sneak in the more science fictional aspects of the show before this past season 's all - out time travel insanity , in order to lure in unsuspecting , potentially sci-fi-phobic audiences , and that 's clearly because they are the ones who need to be taught this stuff the most .
Sure , most of us know our time travel rules -
So much so that we suspect that even detonating a hydrogen bomb through the brute force of lost love is n't going to undo everything as much as cement a new timeline and bump the Lostees forward in time so that they can meet NotLocke - but not everyone is as ... let 's go with " educated , " shall we ? as us .
Hurley and Miles ' most important roles in Lost season 5 were to bring the newbies up to speed about what time travel is all about .
Advertisement
Fringe , meanwhile , dropped the pretense of being an enjoyable dumb - science procedural in the last few weeks of its first season , as soon as Walter wheeled out that chalkboard and started trying to explain the multiverse to us all .
Now , I 'm not buying the " And that 's where deja vu comes from ! " aspect of the explanation at all , but you have to take some of it with a grain of salt thanks to Akiva Goldsman 's involvement ; nonetheless , there 's now a whole new audience out there who have discovered the idea of parallel Earths and Schrödinger 's cat ( Okay , maybe that one is better illustrated here ) , just as Lost has educated them about time travel .
And then we come to Star Trek , which demonstrates to the previously unaware that time travel + changing the past = parallel timeline .
I mean , okay , so it really demonstrates that time travel + changing the past = everyone becomes a younger , hotter version of themselves , but you get what I 'm saying .
It 's a movie that takes the lessons of Abrams ' two television shows and puts them into something approaching practice ...
But for what end ?
Clearly , Abrams ' entire career to date has not been one of merely entertainment , but instead a cunningly disguised form of education in scientific theories unlikely to be taught in even the most liberal schools ( Even Felicity ended with time travel shenanigans ! ) .
We may not know exactly why he is trying his best to make sure that as many people as possible understand the nature of time travel and parallel universes - Perhaps he 's taunted us with an evil master plan that he intends to carry out when he tires of being called the new Spielberg - but the evidence is unmistakable .
All we can do now is hope that interviewers in future will be able to ask him more pointed , valuable questions ... before it 's too late .
June is almost upon us and that means it is time for me to get serious about finishing the list of movies for the June Zombie Movie Marathon Month festival .
I had hoped to have the entire list done by now but for a variety of reasons — scheduling conflicts , inability to confirm that movies will be available , indecision — I have n’t been able to do so .
I have come up with a preliminary list of definite movies to watch ( although not the when , for the most part ) , a couple of themes to explore and a handful of “ maybes . ”
Now I am taking commentary from you fine readers .
Help me decide !
My two themes are five days each of Italy and Japan .
Italy has proven to be the easier of these , and comprises most of my “ definite ” list .
Japan is a little trickier and I may put it to a vote next week ( about time I used that poll for something , anyway ) .
Apart from that there are a few seminal films that I have managed to not see yet and a few my daughter has managed to not see yet and those comprise the rest of what is definite .
Here ’s what I have nailed down , some with commentary :
Zombie ( 30th anniversary !
I ’m doing a free showing of this )
Nightmare City
Hell of the Living Dead
Zombie 3 ( Because Lucio Fulci worked on it briefly )
Burial Grounds : Nights of Terror
Versus
Tokyo Zombie
Plan 9 from Outer Space
Children Should n’t Play with Dead Things
Return of the Living Dead ( daughter has never seen it ! )
Here ’s the stuff I am considering , but have n’t settled on :
Dead Set ( okay , it ’s a TV miniseries , but still a moving picture show )
American Zombie
Mutant
I Walked with a Zombie
Messiah of Evil
Night of the Living Dead ( 1990 ) ( Have n’t seen this in years , like since it was fairly new )
Pet Sematary ( ditto )
Onechanbara
Grapes of Death
Zombie Honeymoon
Okay , that ’s where things stand at the moment .
I ’ve got ten nailed down , ten strong possibilities and a whole , long list of other stuff that I have n’t decided on .
Comments and suggestions are welcome and encouraged .

This is fudge making on easy mode .
Now , I ’ve made plenty of fudge in my day .
Most of my recipes call for candy thermometers , precise heating and cooling , and a lot of beating ( as in , a lot of beating ) .
Not this fudge .
This fudge is easy .
And it ’s really , really good .
This is my one of my mom ’s favorite fudge recipes , based on an old Cook ’s Illustrated clipping .
It ’s creamy , dark and , well , downright fudge-y .
The original recipe explains that the tiny bit of baking soda does something to the fudge ’s pH to help lighten it up .
Easy Dark Chocolate & Walnut Fudge : A note on ingredients
Be sure to use condensed milk �not evaporated milk .
Sweetened condensed milk is really syrupy .
Basically , it ’s whole milk that ’s evaporated with sugar .
It ’s thick , sticky , and very sweet .
( Evaporated milk is condensed milk that ’s not sweetened . )
Sweetened condensed milk
For the chocolate , I used a mix of regular ole semi-sweet chocolate chips and unsweetened Baker ’s chocolate .
Oh , and about the nuts .
This was amazing with walnuts , but I ’ll bet it would also be really good with chopped pecans , hazelnuts , or almonds as well .
For the vanilla , I used the homemade vanilla extract that I ’ve had going for years .
( Vanilla beans + good vodka = fabulous vanilla extract . )
My bottle of homemade vanilla extract , stuffed with vanilla beans
Easy Dark Chocolate & Walnut Fudge :
The basic technique
Basically , you heat most of the ingredients together in an improvised double boiler ( or a real one , if you have it ) until they * just * melt .
Stir in the nuts , then turn the fudge out into a pan to cool and set up .
It ’s really that simple .
Read on for step - by - step photo instructions .
Easy Dark Chocolate & Walnut Fudge
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 oz . unsweetened chocolate
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/8 tsp. salt
1 14-0z . can condensed milk
1 Tbls. vanilla extract
1 cup chopped walnuts
spray oil
Makes about 2 1/2 lbs. of fudge in an 8 - inch square pan
Easy Dark Chocolate & Walnut Fudge :
Do a little prep
Spray an 8 - inch x 8 - inch glass pan lightly with oil .
Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper .
Press it down gently so it sticks .
Set the pan aside .
Next , start an improvised double boiler .
Put about 2 inches of water in a pan on the stove over high heat to get it boiling .
Measure out your chocolate chips and put them in a large , heatproof bowl .
Chop up the unsweetened chocolate into small - ish pieces .
( I like to use a serrated bread knife to do this . )
Toss that into the bowl with the chocolate chips .
Easy Dark Chocolate & Walnut Fudge :
Make the fudge mixture
Add the baking soda and the salt .
Stir to coat the chocolate and evenly distribute the salt and baking soda .
( You do n’t want to end up with clumps of them in your finished fudge . )
Pour in the condensed milk .
Give the inside of the can a scrape with a spatula to get it all out .
Toss in the vanilla .
Stir the whole thing to combine .
Easy Dark Chocolate & Walnut Fudge :
Melt the ingredients
By now , your water should be boiling .
Drop the heat to low .
Set your mixing bowl on top of the pot of water .
The chocolate should start to melt immediately .
Stir constantly until the mixture * just* melts .
This will only take a few minutes .
When the chocolate has just melted and the mixture is fairly smooth , remove the bowl from the heat .
Stir a little more once it ’s off the heat to ensure that all the chocolate has melted .
The mixture will be really thick and creamy , like this :
Easy Dark Chocolate & Walnut Fudge : Finish the fudge
Toss in the chopped nuts .
Stir to combine them well .
Pour the fudge out into your prepared pan .
Smooth it down with a spatula so the surface is fairly even .
Set it in a cool spot ( or in the fridge ) for a few hours until it firms up .
When it ’s firm , cut it up into squares .
Or leave it in the pan and slice as needed .
I cut the whole pan up into squares and put each one in a mini-muffin liner .
This fudge keeps well tightly wrapped on the counter for a few weeks .
That is , if it lasts .
Enjoy !
Employee Free Choice Threatened by New Lobbying Campaign
A new big business lobbying campaign against the Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA HR1409 / S.560 ) threatens to eviscerate the bill .
Starbucks , Whole Foods and CostCo are lobbying together to weaken the pro-labor Cardcheck Bill .
The proposed provisions would tighten some organizing rules in favor of workers and keep the secret ballot , but at the expense of eliminating mandatory arbitration .
Mark Ambinder reports that the new provision would also require 70 % or workers to sign cards to form a union ( cardcheck ) vs 50 % yes vote by secret ballot .
I do n’t see any appeal for organized labor in this “ compromise ” .
First , mandatory arbitration is a big deal because in many cases firms simply drag out negotiations forever , making sure there is no contract — even when unions are recognized .
And 70 % is a high hurdle .
As compromises go , this one will do nothing but compromise unions ’ ability to organize more workers and negotiate contracts .
Even if you do n’t care about workers ’ right to unionize , the fact is that where unions are strong , Democrats win .
Republicans know this , which is why they ’ve done everything they can to weaken unions .
Unions also raise wages generally in the population .
As Nathan Newman notes , even non-union workers benefit from unions , because employers increase wages to be competitive , so they are n’t too easy to unionize .
This is a battle worth fighting .
Households and firms can't access finance as the inter - bank market is still locked , because the banks – as I say each week – are still lying to each other about the full extent of their sub - prime liabilities .
Until they 're forced to " fess up " , credit lines will remain frozen and jobs will be lost .
Artwork : Chip Taylor Yahoo's CEO said Wednesday she was open to discussing a Microsoft acquisition , provided the deal were sweet .
During an onstage interview at the All Things D conference in Carlsbad , California , Carol Bartz said she 'd consider the right offer from Microsoft .
" If there 's boatloads of money and the right technology involved , we'd do a deal , sure , " she was quoted as saying in the Wall Street Journal .
" It 's that simple . "
Microsoft's February 2008 US $ 45 billion offer was priced at $ 31 per share and was later raised to $ 33 .
Yahoo shares [ YHOO ] closed Wednesday at $ 14.94 .
Yahoo and Microsoft have both scrambled to keep pace with Google , which dominates the Internet search advertising market .
Microsoft is expected to relaunch its Live Search product , reportedly under the new name Bing , at the conference on Thursday .
Bartz took over as Yahoo's chief executive after company founder Jerry Yang came under fire for his handling of Microsoft 's attempted takeover .
When she was hired in January , analysts said it was unlikely that Bartz , formerly chairman and CEO of AutoDesk , would have taken the job had it meant simply selling off the company to Microsoft .
We 've been keeping an eye on Shinoda Plasma 's curved PTA ( plasma tube array ) technology since 2007 .
What started as a single 43 - inch prototype grew to 125 - inches in 2008 .
Now , Shinoda is showing off a 145 - inch diagonal prototype consisting of six PTA panels stitched together in a 2 - meter x 3 - meter matrix .
The 960 x 720 pixel resolution might not impress you until you consider the weight : just 7.2-kg ( 15.8 - pounds ) thanks to the slim PTA panels measuring just 1 - mm thick .
Impressive compared to 108 - inch LCDs that weigh in at 196 - kg ( 430 - pounds ) and the original Osborne 1 " laptop " that weighed 24.5 - pounds .
With any luck , these giant displays will be commercialized for signage so we can all simulate crushing motions with two hands .
California is moving quickly to pump $ 415 million in federal stimulus money into upgrading job training and placement services at employment centers around the state , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced Tuesday .
A key legislator praised Schwarzenegger for taking advantage of the Obama administration ’s largess and making sure that it flows as rapidly as possible into communities that have been hard hit by the recession .
But state Senate Majority Leader Dean Florez ( D - Shafter ) also blasted the governor for the way the state ’s problem - plagued unemployment insurance program is run .
With nearly 800,000 people receiving unemployment checks and more people applying for benefits daily , the unemployment insurance system is severely underfunded .
What ’s more , it ’s handicapped by an obsolete computer system and telephone call centers that force people to dial hundreds of times to reach an operator .

The latest pot of federal money wo n’t fix the call centers .
Rather , it will be used to retrain laid - off workers , particularly in high - demand occupations , including public works construction , healthcare and alternative energy generation and related environmental services , said Patrick Henning , director of the California Employment Development Department .
The federal assistance also will be used to bolster services for the unemployed , such as providing computers for doing resumes and searching online job postings at about 250 One - Stop Career Centers .
They are operated by the state EDD and nonprofit partner agencies , such as Goodwill Industries .
About a third of the federal money is earmarked for Southern California , with $ 44 million going to the city of Los Angeles and $ 34 million to Los Angeles County .
The new funding doubles the federal investment in California job services this year as the state copes with a 10.5 % unemployment rate , its highest level in more than a quarter of a century .
“ With unemployment affecting historic numbers of Californians in this difficult economy , I am committed to doing everything within my power to provide relief to our unemployed and get Californians back to work , ” Schwarzenegger said in a statement .

But the governor must do more to help people who are applying for unemployment benefits and need to contact the state , Florez said .
He sent a letter to Schwarzenegger on Tuesday asking him to declare an “ economic emergency ” that would allow him to send extra workers to answer the phones and to speed up improvements to the EDD ’s computers and call centers .
“ EDD seems to be operating without a coherent plan to even pick up the phone when [ people ] call for help , ” Florez wrote the governor .
“ This is unconscionable for many Californians who are struggling economically and need the lifeline of an unemployment check . ”
Schwarzenegger is pushing hard to improve the state ’s response to unemployment insurance claims during a time of skyrocketing demand , spokeswoman Rachel Cameron said .
He recently opened call centers on Saturdays , expanded Internet claim filing options and authorized the hiring of 850 new caseworkers .

If you are not sure how these work , or why they are important , you should really read up on this elsewhere .
When it comes to URL:s , there are two things all CMS : es seems to get wrong .
Why not try to address these issues ?
URL:s are cryptic
The URL is one of the most important resources for SEO , so we should always make an effort to present nicely formatted URLs to the search engines .
Your human visitors will benefit from this too .
A horrible example is Joomla .
While there are a number of plugins that reformats the URL:s , the problem should n't have been there to begin with .
URL:s can't easily be changed Some would say this is a good thing .
I agree that URL:s should n't change .
But when you must do it , it 's better if you can do it cleanly and effortlessly .
It 's not enough to simply change the URL of the page .
All saved bookmarks to that specific page would suddenly be invalid .
This includes bookmarks in peoples browsers , and perhaps more importantly saved links in social bookmarking sites like stumbleupon , delicious , digg etc .
Probably the most important factor is the search engines .
Google gives all indexed pages a " pagerank " that effectively determines how many visitors you will get .
If your original URL just disappears , you will loose your hard - earned pagerank , and with it , your visitors .
Because of this , the old URL needs to be redirected as well , or you 'll find yourself losing traffic .
Google is known to transfer it's pageranks to the new URL when it 's given a 301 redirect .
This is something that is often done as an afterthought , possibly by dumping a list of expired URL:s to a .htaccess file for URL rewriting .
I believe that it should be a cornerstone feature of any CMS .
The page struct
Let 's define a basic datastructure to hold our pages :
; Our page struct .
Pretty basic , except for these : ; [ urls ] is a list of strings for the valid URL:s of the page .
; [ revisions ] is a latest - first chronological list of xexpr:s , representing page revisions .
( define - struct page ( language title description keywords urls revisions template ) #:mutable )
The struct contains the language of the content of the page , the SEO relevant metadata , a list of URL:s ( current and all former ) , a list of content revisions and a template .
The template will be responsible for rendering the page .
This is very useful when the same site might have different types of pages that needs to be rendered in unique ways .
It is also defined to be mutable , so we can make changes to the page .
To be able to use this struct at all , we need to define a function for rendering it :
; Render the page with the current template .
( define ( page - render page ) ( ( page - template page ) page ( if ( not ( empty ? ( page - revisions page ) ) ) ( car ( page - revisions page ) ) empty ) ) )
The template assigned to the page is a function that takes the page struct itself and the xexpr to be used as the HTML content .
Obviously , we need to also define such a template :
; A XHTML template to render the page struct .
; The [ content ] argument makes it easy to render work - in - progress or old revisions .
; ( A more realistic example should probably wrap the content in a couple of divs together ; with a global menu , footer , search - field etc. ) ( define ( test - template page content ) ( xhtml - response ( page - language page ) ( xhtml - head ( page - title page ) ( page - description page ) ( page - keywords page ) '( " behaviour / jquery.js " " behaviour /carousell.js " " behaviour/lightbox.js " ) '( " design/reset.css " " design/layout.css " " design/typography.css " ) '( ( " if IE 6 " . " design/ie6.css " ) ( " if IE 7 " . " design/ie7.css " ) ) ) `( body , @content ) ) )
This code builds on top of the code we created in the first part of this tutorial .
Since we have changed the representation of the page , we need to update the dispatcher to use this new page struct :
( define ( some - dispatcher page ) ( make ( string - append " / " ( car ( page - urls page ) ) ) ( lambda ( request - ignored ) ( page - render page ) ) ) )
We also need a test page in the new format :
; Let 's build an example page .
( define test - page ( make - page " en " " Everything cute " " Here , you 'll find everything that 's cute and fuzzy . " ' ( " bunnies " " rainbows " " soap bubbles " " candy cotton " ) ' ( " cutest - bunny - all - week " " bunny " ) '( ( ( h1 " Cutest bunny you 've seen all week " ) ( p " Look at " ( a ( ( href " http://www.cutebunnies.com " ) ) " this adorable bunny " ) " I found on the Internet . " ) )
( ( h1 " Cutest bunny you 've seen all week " ) ( p " Look at " ( a ( ( href " http://www.cutebunnies.com " ) ) " this adorable bunny " ) " I 'm blog - spamming about . " ) ) ) test - template ) )
Notice that this example page has two URL:s and two revisions of the content .
For now , only the first element in both lists will be used at all .
When you put all this together , your definitions window should look like this :
#lang scheme ( require " xhtml.ss " ) ;
Our page struct .
Pretty basic , except for these : ; [ urls ] is a list of strings for the valid URL:s of the page .
; [ revisions ] is a latest - first chronological list of xexpr:s , representing page revisions .
( define - struct page ( language title description keywords urls revisions template ) # :mutable ) ; Render the page with the current template .
( define ( page - render page ) ( ( page - template page ) page ( if ( not ( empty ? ( page - revisions page ) ) ) ( car ( page - revisions page ) ) empty ) ) ) ; A XHTML template to render the page struct .
; The [ content ] argument makes it easy to render work - in - progress or old revisions .
; ( A more realistic example should probably wrap the content in a couple of divs together ; with a global menu , footer , search - field etc. ) ( define ( test - template page content ) ( xhtml - response ( page - language page ) ( xhtml - head ( page - title page ) ( page - description page ) ( page - keywords page ) '( " behaviour / jquery.js " " behaviour /carousell.js " " behaviour/lightbox.js " ) '( " design/reset.css " " design/layout.css " " design/typography.css " ) '( ( " if IE 6 " . " design/ie6.css " ) ( " if IE 7 " . " design/ie7.css " ) ) ) `( body , @content ) ) ) ;
Let 's build an example page .
( define test - page ( make - page " en " " Everything cute " " Here , you 'll find everything that 's cute and fuzzy . " ' ( " bunies " " rainbows " " soap bubbles " " candy cotton " ) ' ( " cutest - bunny - all - week " " bunny " ) '( ( ( h1 " Cutest bunny you 've seen all week " ) ( p " Look at " ( a ( ( href " http://www.cutebunnies.com " ) ) " this adorable bunny " ) " I found on the Internet . " ) )
( ( h1 " Cutest bunny you 've seen all week " ) ( p " Look at " ( a ( ( href " http://www.cutebunnies.com " ) ) " this adorable bunny " ) " I 'm blog - spamming about . " ) ) ) test - template ) ) ( require web - server / dispatchers / dispatch - pathprocedure ) ( define ( some - dispatcher page ) ( make ( string - append " / " ( car ( page - urls page ) ) ) ( lambda ( request - ignored ) ( page - render page ) ) ) ) ( require web - server / web- server ) ( define stop - server ( serve #: dispatch ( some - dispatcher test - page ) # :port 8080 ) )
Remember that the new dispatcher respects the URL defined by the page struct , so you will have to visit the new URL , probably http://localhost:8080/cutest-bunny-all-week
The page dispatcher
We still do n't have the functionality to change and maintain URL:s .
To do this , we should know a little bit more about dispatchers .
PLT Scheme comes with a number of standard dispatchers .
We have already seen the path - procedure dispatcher .
Another very useful one is the sequencer dispatcher .
It takes a list of dispatchers and tries them one - by - one until it finds one that can handle the request .
As it turns out , this is exactly what we need .
since the functions that create these dispatchers have the same name , we need to rename them when they are imported .
The module system in PLT Scheme can handle this without to much trouble .
just add these lines in your definitions window :
( require ( rename - in ( only - in web - server / dispatchers / dispatch - pathprocedure make ) ( make make - pathprocedure ) ) ) ( require ( rename - in ( only - in web - server / dispatchers / dispatch - sequencer make ) ( make make - sequencer ) ) )
Now we have access to both dispatchers through the names make - pathprocedure and make - sequencer .
Using the sequencer dispatcher , we can make a single dispatcher that handles all the URL:s of any page .
The first URL in the list it the " real " one .
We should simply dispatch that URL to the template function rendering the page .
The rest of the URL:s should be dispatched to a function that redirects the browser to the real URL .
Pretty simple to say , and just as simple to write :
; To easily handle the multiple URL:s of the page correctly , we can build a custom dispatcher .
; [ page ] is a page struct .
( define ( page - dispatcher page ) ; Each page have a number of URL:s we must handle .
;
The first URL in the list is the current one .
( let ( ( real - url ( car ( page - urls page ) ) ) ( redirecting - urls ( cdr ( page - urls page ) ) ) ) ( apply make - sequencer ; The real URL should render the page .
( make - pathprocedure ( string - append " / " real - url ) ( lambda ( request - ignored ) ( page - render page ) ) ) ;
All the others need to redirect 301 . ( map ( lambda ( redircting - url ) ( make - pathprocedure ( string - append " / " redircting - url ) ( lambda ( request ) ( path - redirect - 301 - response request real - url ) ) ) ) redirecting - urls ) ) ) )
Before this will actually work , we need to define the function path - redirect - 301 - response .
It is used to build a redirecting response , causing the browser ( and Google ! ) to be redirected to the URL of our choice .
Since we do n't want to bother with details , like what server we are currently serving the page from , and what port we are using , we just copy this information from the URI struct in the request .
We also need to require another module to make it work .
( require net / uri-codec ) ( require net /url ) ; Creates a response struct , redirecting the browser to another path on the same server while preserving everything else in the URI .
( define ( path - redirect - 301 - response request new - url ) ( make - response / basic 301 " Moved Permanently " ( current - seconds ) TEXT / HTML -MIME -TYPE ( list ( make - header # " Location " ( string -> bytes / utf - 8 ( url - > string ; We copy the current URL ... ( struct - copy url ( request - uri request ) ; ... and just replace the path .
( path ( list ( make - path / param ; The URL should be properly encoded . ( % 20 , etc. ) ( form - urlencoded - encode new - url ) empty ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
There .
We can now test this .
Just make sure it's all in your definitions window and modify the code starting the server to use this new dispatcher :
; Starting the server with the page - dispatcher .
( define stop - server ( serve #: dispatch ( page - dispatcher test - page ) # :port 8080 ) )
Click the Run button in DrScheme and refresh your browser .
If all goes well you will see the same page as before .
The new , interesting part happens when you enter the " old " URL of the page , probably http://localhost:8080/bunny.
It should now redirect you to the newer URL http://localhost:8080/cutest-bunny-all-week .
Since we are building a CMS , we probably want to have more than a single page .
Therefore , our page dispatcher should take a list of pages and find the page of the current URL .
This turns out to be embarrassingly simple .
; Handles any number of pages . ; [ pages ] is a list of page structs .
( define ( page - list - dispatcher pages ) ( apply make - sequencer ( map page - dispatcher pages ) ) )
If you modify the line where the server is started , you can now serve any number of pages :
; Starting the server with the page - list - dispatcher .
( define stop - server ( serve #: dispatch ( page - list - dispatcher ( list test - page ) ) # :port 8080 ) )
Updating the page
; Add the new URL to the top of the list , but first remove it if it 's already in there .
; All URLs but the first will redirect 301 .
This bookkeeping makes sure that the new URL ; will recieve the visitors ( and pagerank ) of any old URL .
( define ( set- page - url ! page new - url ) ( set - page - urls ! page ( cons new - url ( filter ( lambda ( x ) ( not ( equal ? x new - url ) ) ) ( page - urls page ) ) ) ) )
; Add the new revision to the top of the list .
( It might be a good idea to limit the list to n revisions . ) ( define ( set- page - revision ! page new - revision ) ( set - page - revisions ! page ( cons new - revision ( page - revisions page ) ) ) )
Since we can handle the multiple URL:s , we should write a simple interface for this .
The code above will simply add the new URL to the list , or move it to the beginning if it 's already there .
I also added a function to slightly simplify handling revisions .
Let 's wrap this up by putting our new functions in their own file and adding a few more example pages .
Your definitions window should look something like this :
#lang scheme ( require " xhtml.ss " ) ( require " page.ss " ) ; some example pages .
( define test - pages ( list ( make - page " en " " Everything cute " " Here , you 'll find everything that 's cute and fuzzy . " ' ( " bunies " " rainbows " " soap bubbles " " candy cotton " ) ' ( " cutest - bunny - all - week " " bunny " ) '( ( ( h1 " Cutest bunny you 've seen all week " ) ( p " Look at " ( a ( ( href " http://www.cutebunnies.com " ) ) " this adorable bunny " ) " I found on the Internet . " ) )
( ( h1 " Cutest bunny you 've seen all week " ) ( p " Look at " ( a ( ( href " http://www.cutebunnies.com " ) ) " this adorable bunny " ) " I 'm blog - spamming about . " ) ) ) test - template ) ( make - page " en " " Hello World " " Another take at the Hello World page . " ' ( " hello world " ) ' ( " hello - world " " hello world " ) '( ( ( p " Hello World " ) ) ) test - template ) ) ) ( require web - server / dispatchers / dispatch - pathprocedure ) ( require web - server / web- server ) ; Starting the server with the page - list - dispatcher .
( define stop - server ( serve #: dispatch ( page - list - dispatcher test - pages ) # :port 8080 ) )
Try reverting a page to an older revision !
Bonus points if you implement a function to move the nth revision to the first place in the list .
; The page struct contains all it 's revisions .
;
We can revert to an older version with a function like this : ( define ( page - revert ! page ) ( set - page - revision ! page ( cadr ( page - revisions page ) ) ) )
Share and enjoy !

Dear Jeffrey ,
We appreciate your interest in the Animation Program ; however , we regret to inform you that you have not been accepted .
We have limited spaces within the program and wish to fill them with people who have real skill .
We ’re sorry to be the ones to bring this absolute lack of talent to your attention , but know that your family and friends are weak and too afraid to bruise your frail ego and tell you what they really think .
This is entirely your own fault .
They may have seen your work and expressed approval .
But you should have noticed the slight pause as they assessed whether it was not more beneficial to tell you the truth before they answered .
And why were you too dim to see the way they refused to peer at your work for more than a few seconds ?
Had it been as beautiful as they said , they would have stared at it for long , long hours , pondering the theme and lauding over its sensitivity , the way they would with real art .
Instead , their eyes darted to other objects in the room , the light fixture , the table … the door ( how they must have yearned for an escape ) .
You should have seen this coming .
We wish wholeheartedly that you could have been there as we reviewed your portfolio and ( literally ) tore it to pieces .
We wish you could have seen us as we laughed , mocking your crude linework , and concept of space and form .
As we pretended to draw like you would , our brows furrowed , hands pawing the pencil like a cripple , scribbling stick - men and pausing to make grunting noises until we toppled from our chairs in painful , spasmodic laughter .
If you still wish to have a career in the Animation industry , may we suggest the janitorial services path ?
Cleaning offices and mopping floors may be your only entry into this sphere .
Normally , we say “ better luck next time ” , but may we suggest that there not be a next time ?
Instead , focus on your ability to polish door knobs , and make toilets shine with the reflections of the animators as they use them .
Regards , and thanks for the laughs ,
The Animation Program Portfolio Review Committee
P.S. Do not come pick up your portfolio .
It has been burned .

AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX
Venue : Albert Park , Melbourne Dates : 27 - 29 March Coverage : Comprehensive live coverage and reaction from Saturday 's qualifying session and Sunday 's race across BBC TV , radio and online .
Find complete listings here Hamilton will start from the back of the grid for the first time in his F1 career McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh says last season 's title push has cost the team their competitiveness this term .
Heikki Kovalainen and Lewis Hamilton finished qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix in 14th and 15th places .
Hamilton was demoted to last place after a gearbox change , but will start in 18th place after Toyota were penalised for breaching regulations .
" Last year we were developing our car up until the last race and so we are under - developed , " he told BBC Sport .
" That was a decision we took last year and , given that we won the drivers ' championship , you have to say it was the right call .
" But some of our competitors - as you saw in qualifying - have probably been developing this year 's car since this time last year and , consequently , have a much more developed car than us .
" We must face that fact and catch up as quickly as we can . "
Hamilton and Kovalainen have long been tempering the hopes of their supporters by admitting the McLaren is not yet up to scratch .
And that was borne out throughout practice and qualifying , with the duo well off the pace of the leading pack .
The pair were consequently virtually out of the running for a podium place even before their poor qualifying effort , but Whitmarsh insists the team will bounce back to challenge for honours later in the season .
" We know that at the moment our car is , frankly , not quick enough to win races , " he said .
606 : DEBATE McLaren seem to go through a bad patch every year , if not fail entirely , and frequently its at the start of the year
Dreaduk " But Lewis and Heikki are professional and can see we 've improved it in the last couple of weeks , before which it was in a pretty poor shape .
" In the coming races we 'll be improving our car even further and hopefully quickly enough to get up there as quick as we can .
" I think it 's a long season and certainly no - one in this team is giving up yet .
At the moment the championship is wide open . "

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Vehicles on America 's roads today get only about three miles more per gallon than vehicles back in 1923 , University of Michigan researchers say .
A new study in the journal Energy Policy by Michael Sivak and Omer Tsimhoni of the U - M Transportation Research Institute shows that overall fuel efficiency for vehicles in the United States was 14 miles per gallon in 1923 and 17.2 mpg in 2006 .
The researchers documented and analyzed the annual changes in actual fuel efficiency of vehicles on U.S. roads from 1923 to 2006 by using information about distances driven and fuel consumed to calculate fuel efficiency of the overall fleet and of different classes of vehicles .
They found that overall fleet fuel efficiency actually decreased from 14 mpg in 1923 to a low of 11.9 mpg in 1973 , but then rapidly increased to 16.9 mpg by 1991 .
" After the 1973 oil embargo , vehicle manufacturers achieved major improvements in the on - road fuel economy of vehicles , " said Sivak , research professor and head of UMTRI 's Human Factors Division .
" However , the slope of the improvement has decreased substantially since 1991 . "
From 1991 to 2006 , fuel efficiency increased by less than 2 percent , compared with a 42 percent increase in mpg between 1973 and 1991 .
According to the study , fuel efficiency for cars improved from 13.4 mpg in 1973 to 21.2 mpg in 1991 , but reached only 22.4 mpg by 2006 .
For light trucks , the numbers were 9.7 mpg in 1966 , 17 mpg in 1991 and 18 mpg in 2006 .
Medium and heavy trucks showed modest improvement from 5.6 mpg in 1966 to 5.9 mpg in 2006 .
" Future improvements in fuel economy of vehicles are needed across the board , for both passenger and commercial vehicles , " Sivak said .
" Some of the improvements in effective fuel efficiency will come from the ongoing partial shift from using light trucks to cars for personal transportation .
" Given the differences in the fuel efficiency of light trucks and cars , a 25 percent shift would result in about a 2 percent reduction in the total consumption of fuel for all vehicles . "
But the researchers say the focus should not necessarily be on classes of vehicles with the lowest fuel efficiency , such as heavy trucks and buses , which have alternative societal measures that are relevant ( e.g. , miles per pound of freight or passenger miles per gallon ) .
Instead , the focus should be on the least - efficient vehicles within each class .
For example , an improvement from 40 mpg to 41 mpg for a vehicle driven 12,000 miles per year saves 7 gallons of fuel a year .
However , an improvement from 15 mpg to 16 mpg for a vehicle driven the same amount of miles saves 50 gallons of fuel a year .
" In other words , society has much more to gain from improving vehicles that get lower gas mileage , " Sivak said .
" Such improvements could be fostered by tax policies that assist the development and introduction of new relevant technologies and encourage scrapping older vehicles . "

BUDAPEST , Hungary , May 4 ( UPI ) -- U.S. FBI agents are helping Hungarian police investigate a recent series of killings involving Gypsies .
The head of Hungary 's police Jozsef Bencze said FBI agents analyze evidence they receive from Hungarian police officers and help produce psychological profiles of killers , the Hungarian news agency MTI said Monday .

About 100 Hungarian police officers work on some 18 cases which are linked with the killings of Gypsies in northeastern Hungary , Bencze said .
The Romany community has about 600,000 members and is the largest ethnic minority in Hungary .
Last week , Bencze said he suspects the killings could be blamed on the same group of extremists .
Two Gypsies were killed in the town of Nagycsecs in November .
A Gypsy father and his 5 - year - old son were killed in Tatarszentgyorgy in February and a 54 - year - old Gypsy man was shot dead in Tiszalok April 22 .
A recent public opinion survey found 82 percent of Hungarians hold negative feelings toward members of the Romany minority , MTI said .
The survey was carried out among 2,500 adult Hungarians from March 23 to April 7 , MTI said .
My baby daughter is desperately ill and her life has been put at risk by the selfishness of a sizable minority of north London parents and their wrong - headed beliefs about the MMR vaccine .
Earlier this week my normally vigorous and feisty 11 - month - old was reduced to drowsy , snot - filled lethargy .
She refused food , became uncharacteristically listless and developed a hacking cough .
Then that evening the measles rash appeared over most of her body – great timing for trying to get an appointment with the doctor .
The waiting room was rammed with patients convinced they had contracted swine flu .
That , at least , is a rational fear .
The anti-MMR parents have endangered my child ( she was due to have the vaccine at 13 months ) because of their own ill - informed selfishness – and I 'm furious .
The sorry MMR saga began in 1998 with a tiny study ( since partially retracted ) in the Lancet .
Andrew Wakefield and his team described 12 children with both bowel and behavioural problems who underwent various blood tests , gastrointestinal biopsies and lumbar punctures .
It was , frankly , a deeply unimpressive piece of science which came to the less than stunning conclusion , " Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its ­possible relation to this vaccine . "
Instead , Wakefield himself is now being investigated by the General Medical Council over the research , because of alleged breaches of medical ethics and financial conflicts of interest .
But what followed was a prolonged and shameful journalistic episode , in which Wakefield 's speculation and misinformation was spread via flimsy news stories and scandalous comment pieces .
In 2001 , at the peak of the media attention when the Blairs refused to say whether Leo had received the jab , I could almost forgive precious parents for being confused .
But now there is ­absolutely no excuse .
A shoddy theory has been conclusively quashed .
The World Health Organisation 's take on the wealth of studies now out there is that " no evidence exists of a causal association between the MMR vaccine and autism or autistic disorders " .
On its website on immunisation the NHS states that , " independent experts from around the world have found no credible scientific evidence for such a link and there is now a large amount of evidence showing that there is no link " .
Trust me , this is as nailed down as science gets .
So anyone who clings to the notion that MMR causes autism is just plain wrong .
Worse , if you opt not to have your child vaccinated , you are reducing the " herd immunity " and putting other children at serious risk .
To be effective , the jab must cover 95 % of the population , but because of the actions of MMR refusniks that is now below 85 % – and in some parts of London it is down to 60 % .
Those who delay or miss out their child 's vaccinations are putting ­everyone else at risk .
Measles is a ­serious ­disease that can lead to hearing loss , brain inflammation and death – plus miscarriage in pregnant women .
According to the Health ­Protection Agency there were 1,348 cases of ­measles last year , compared with 56 in 1998 .
In 2006 a 14 - year - old boy died of ­measles – the first fatal case for 14 years .
The reduction in herd immunity is ­causing unnecessary suffering .
The decision by many of my neighbours not to vaccinate their children is on a par with the drunk who decides to get into his car to drive home .
It is a personally reckless action that also endangers the lives of everyone else on the road .
Society should view the MMR refuseniks with the same degree of scorn .
Barack Obama is taking on health care , financial regulation , torture and environmental policy .
He ’s also revamping the White House art collection .
The Obamas are sending ripples through the art world as they put the call out to museums , galleries and private collectors that they ’d like to borrow modern art by African - American , Asian , Hispanic and female artists for the White House .
In a sharp departure from the 19th - century still lifes , pastorals and portraits that dominate the White House ’s public rooms , ...
A French government agency called MIVILUDES ( Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaries -- Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combating Cultic Deviancy ) recently issued a 199 - page report charging religious cults with having a growing influence in international bodies such as the United Nations .
According to a report at Digital Journal , " A sect is defined here as being any religious organization which can be characterized as employing any of the following methods ; Mental destabilization , exorbitant financial demands , a rupture with members ' original environment , power in the hands of one person , the invasion of a person 's physical integrity , the recruitment of children , antisocial preaching and troubling public order , activities which lead it to be tried in a court of law , using parallel economic structures , attempts to infiltrate the workplace , schools , and public powers . "
Among the 50 or so religious groups that MIVILUDES tracks in its report ( La justice face aux derives sectaries -- Justice with Regard to Sect or Cult abuse ) are : Jehovah 's Witnesses , Scientology , Mormons , The Universal Church , Raelians , and The Unification Church ( the Rev. Sun Myung Moon . ) .
Ten pages of this year 's Annual Report ( in French ) are devoted " to a stinging criticism of the activity of sects and their supporters in the UN and the OSCE ( Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ) , " Digital Journal pointed out .
" The OSCE is the biggest security - oriented intergovernmental organization on the planet .... [ whose ] job is to surveill and uphold principles such as fair elections , press freedom and human rights .
It is an ad - hoc UN Agency . "
According to Digital Journal , the report looks closely at NGOs ( non-governmental organizations ) " which it says are attempting to legitimize sect activities under cover of the principles of religious freedom .
They are said to be acting in concert to limit the influence of the MIVILUDES within the UN , using tactics such as official complaints and smear tactics . "
MIVILUDES , which originated in a presidential decree on November 28 , 2002 , has a broad mission consisting of :
* " observing and analyzing movements perceived as constituting a threat to public order or that violate French law "
* " coordinating the appropriate response "
* " informing the public about potential risks "
* " helping victims to receive aid "
Since its inception , MIVILUDES has apparently been the subject of intense scrutiny and broad criticism .
Many of the groups listed in earlier reports expressed outrage at their inclusion claiming it would lead to them being stigmatized .
According to Digital Journal , " NGOs said to be active in trying to destabilize the Miviludes ' work include Human Rights Without Frontiers , the Institute on Religion and Public Policy , the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty , and the Information and Advice Centre for New Spiritualities . "
" These and other organizations are said to be acting as front organizations for various religions who do not have UN accredited presence .
Most notable amongst them is the Church of Scientology , which has launched several attacks on the Miviludes , notably by using the US State Department 's clout at the UN .
The Scientology Internet site logo looks very much like the UN logo and the Church presents itself as being ' Associated with the UN Department of Public Information . ' "
Religion News
Blog noted that AFP reported that the MIVILUDES report is not limited to question regarding sects and the UN .
It also " includes a chapter on Satanism , which the organization says is gaining ground through the Internet ....
Further chapters address the way cults use the internet , and detail the fight against runaway sects in France and the rest of Europe . "
In addition , Religion News Blog pointed out : " The report also denounces a huge increase in unqualified therapists , warning that sects are using the personality coaching and self - help trends to target impressionable people .
25 to 30 percent of psychotherapists in France are not certified practitioners .
Some are charlatans , who use their practices to recruit the vulnerable .
The Internet has also become a frequent tool for sect recruitment . "
( A totally un-scientific survey conducted by your humble reporter -- I spoke to a fellow gym member who was born in Morocco and raised in France -- confirmed the report 's observations about France 's therapists ! )
Digital Journal concluded its piece by pointing out that " France is a fiercely secular country " which in part explains " the existence of an organization as unique and with as much influence as the Miviludes . "
It 's " long - running battles with various religious organizations ... . has [ now ] moved onto the international stage the stakes have gone up and both sides are sharpening their knives . "

Photos found on a Chinese language website purport to show the autofocus and digital compass features expected to be a part of the upcoming iPhone .
We ’re not sure how much credence to give these photos , but if true , the implementation of autofocus means that there ’s at least one next - gen iPhone floating around in the wild .
According to the website , putting your finger on a specific part of the screen moves the blue box seen above , and subsequently moves the camera ’s focus .

Expensive Car Accidents
Everybody dreams of having a sports car or a luxury car at some point in their lives , but have you ever wondered what it would feel like to crash one of these mega expensive vehicles ?
Car insurance premiums are out of this world on exotic cars like Lamborghinis and Ferraris .
Imagine what kind of auto insurance quotes you would get after crashing your $ 250,000 Lamborghini ; you would probably be able to buy a Toyota Yaris with just your Lamborghini insurance money !
The following pictures may cause nightmares for car enthusiasts , but it does make you step back and realize that there is more to life than just having an expensive car .
13 . Porsche Boxter
While Porsche Boxter 's may be the cheapest car on this list , I would still cry if I destroyed this car .
It appears as though they either T - Boned another driver or drove the front end of this poor Porsche into a fire hydrant .
This guy gets bonus points for tearing his wheel right off .
12 . Audi R8
The Audi R8 has been immensely popular since Audi recently released them to the public .
While this particular ca does not appear to be in that rough of shape , the fact that it is in a ditch probably means there is at least a few thousand dollars in damage .
I prefer my Audi R8's on the road as opposed to in the ditch ; that is just me though ; whatever floats your boat .
11 . Aston Martin
Let 's face it , Aston Martins are NOT cheap vehicles .
While this car is no write off , I would not want to be the person forking over the bill on this fender bender .
I 'd bet the unibody is bent , the bumper supports need to be replaced and obviously you 'd need a new bumper skin and hood .
It is never nice to see these cars in rough shape .
A new report released today reveals the true extent of child killings by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip during its 23 day offensive on Gaza between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ( PCHR ) is publishing War Crimes Against Children in response to the unprecedented number of children killed by Israeli forces in its latest operation ; a total of 313 children under the age of eighteen .
Containing numerous eye witness testimonies , the report brings to light Israel 's widespread targeting of unarmed civilians , including children , throughout the offensive .
' Operation Cast Lead ' was the biggest Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip in nearly 42 years of occupation .
1,414 Palestinians were killed , and PCHR investigations have found the overwhelming majority , 83 per cent , were civilians .
One of the cases in the report is that of 18 month old Farah al - Helu , who was killed on 4 January .
The al - Helu family had been told to evacuate their house in Zaytoun , eastern Gaza , but while they were attempting to flee , Israeli soldiers opened fire on them .
Farah was shot in the stomach and bled to death two hours later .
War Crimes Against Children exposes the abject failure of Israeli authorities to uphold international humanitarian law , which provides protection for children in armed conflict and the lack of adequate precautions taken to distinguish between civilians and military targets .
The report also details indiscriminate shelling of homes and schools where internally displaced people were sheltering , the psychological impact of the offensive , and the alarming scale of physical injuries inflicted on young people .
" We are calling for an independent full - scale investigation into all documented attacks on civilians during the offensive , " said Raji Sourani , director of PCHR .
" Israel must be held fully accountable for the crimes it has perpetrated against Gaza 's civilian population , including alleged war crimes against children .
We cannot allow the lives of these children to just be statistics in the history books of the Middle East . "
PCHR is calling on the international community to urge Israel to respect and uphold the human rights of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory .
" Urgent measures are needed in order to prevent further deaths , " added Mr Sourani .
The Centre is also recommending the urgent establishment of an independent committee to investigate the child killings .
The committee must meet international standards of independence and transparency and publish its findings publicly .

Germans Disguise Panthers
Cleverly Imitate M10 Gun Carriage
Investigation of four German Panther tanks knocked out in the Malmedy area in the December breakthrough in Belgium revealed that the tanks were carefully and cleverly disguised as U.S. M10 gun motor carriages .
After inspecting the tanks and realizing the amount of time , work , and materials involved in order to imitate the appearance of the M10 , Ordnance intelligence investigators expressed the opinion that these disguised tanks , used in the proper tactical situation and at the proper time , would have caused considerable damage .
Because the false vehicle numbers of the tanks knocked out were B - 4 , B - 5 , B - 7 , and B - 10 , investigators concluded that at least ten similarly disguised tanks might have been in action .
Inside the one tank which was not blown up too badly to be inspected were found items of U.S. clothing such as a helmet , overcoat , and leggings .
To heighten the deception , U.S. stars were painted on both sides and also on the top of the turret , the entire tank was painted O.D. , and U.S. unit markings were painted on the false bow and rear .
In disguising the Panther the distinctive cupola was removed from the turret and two semicircular hatch covers were hinged in its place to the turret top in order to cover the opening .
In addition , it was necessary to remove extra water cans , gas cans , the rammer staff container , and other external accessories .
The tank then was camouflaged or disguised with sheet metal , that used on the turret and upper bow being three twenty - seconds of an inch thick and that on time sides of the hull being nine sixty - fourths of an inch thick .
The lower part of the false bow was thicker , possibly made of double plates .
To accomplish the deceptive modifications , which pointed to at least fourth or fifth echelon alterations , the work probably was done by maintenance units rather than at a factory .
The work probably was divided into four sections : turret , bow , rear , and sides .
Turret Changes
The turret was disguised by using five pieces of sheet metal , two of which were cut to resemble the distinctive sides of the M10 turret and then were flanged on the edges , bent to shape , and stiffened with small angle iron .
The gun shield was carefully formed from another sheet to the exact shape of the M10 shield , and a hole was made to the right of the gun hole in the shield for the co-axial M.G. 34 , a hole which does not exist in the M10 shield .
Two pieces of sheet metal made up the rear of the turret , one representing the bottom slant surface of the rear and one representing the counterweight .
The pieces representing the sides and rear were joined together and braced with angle iron , and the whole was attached to the turret .
The false gun shield was attached to the Panther gun shield , and all the lifting rings , brackets , extra - armor studs , etc. , found on the M10 turret were carefully duplicated and welded to the false turret .
False Bow
Approximately four pieces of sheet metal , shaped to imitate as closely as possible the contours of the M10 bow , made up the false bow , necessary because the Panther bow is bulkier than the M10 .
The false bottom was shaped to give the characteristic appearance of the front drive sprocket housing of the M10 , and the top was shaped carefully and various component pieces attached to the front of the tank .
All the brackets , lifting rings , towing devises , etc. , of the M10 bow were also imitated .
A square opening was cut in the false bow to permit the use of the bow M.G. 34 , but a removable cover attached with a small chain was made for this opening .
False Rear and Sides
The false rear was made of sheet metal .
It was a faithful duplicate of the M10 rear except for two holes to permit the twin exhaust elbows of the Panther to protrude .
An attempt was made to imitate the skirting armor of the M10 which appears to hang lower than the side armor of the Panther and is bevelled in at the bottom .
A long flat strip of sheet metal was attached to the sides parallel to the ground , and a vertical sheet strip was attached at right angles to this strip to give the appearance of low skirting armor .
Features which aid in recognizing disguised Panthers and which cannot be camouflaged easily are :
1 . The distinctive Panther bogie suspension .
( The M18 motor gun carriage now has a somewhat similar suspension . )
2 . The muzzle brake on the 7.5 cm Kw.K. 42 .
3 . The wide and distinctive track of the Panther tank .
Among mainline Protestants , acceptance of homosexuality stands at 56 % , higher than among the total U.S. population ( 50 % ) .
However , the degree of acceptance of homosexuality varies greatly among individual denominations of Protestant Christianity .
Members of the Episcopal Church and United Church of Christ have the highest levels of acceptance , roughly seven - in - ten .
At the other end of the spectrum are American Baptists and members of historically black Protestant churches , where about four - in - ten accept homosexuality .
The lowest level of acceptance is found among evangelical Protestants ; only a quarter say homosexuality should be accepted .

As the G20 leaders gathered amid protestors in London last week to battle the economic meltdown , the World of Golf unveiled its latest promotion called “ Take a Swing at Brown ” .
The company has erected two giant images of Brown and Darling on four of its driving ranges – Croydon , Chislehurst , Sidcup and New Malden , the latter of which is the largest and most popular in Europe .
Brown and Darling both have targets painted on their foreheads and are positioned in full view of the hydraulically powered driving ranges for thousands of players to hit them with a Tiger Woods - like shot .
The driving ranges are open seven days a week from 8 am to 10.30 pm and stadium lighting means that anyone wishing to indulge in a little late night ' golf rage ' may do so .
With over 13 million golf balls being hit at World of Golf driving ranges every year , Brown and Darling look set to lose their heads very soon .

America is devolving into a third - world nation .
And if we do not immediately halt our elite ’s rapacious looting of the public treasury we will be left with trillions in debts , which can never be repaid , and widespread human misery which we will be helpless to ameliorate .
Our anemic democracy will be replaced with a robust national police state .
The elite will withdraw into heavily guarded gated communities where they will have access to security , goods and services that cannot be afforded by the rest of us .
Tens of millions of people , brutally controlled , will live in perpetual poverty .
This is the inevitable result of unchecked corporate capitalism .
The stimulus and bailout plans are not about saving us .
They are about saving them .
We can resist , which means street protests , disruptions of the system and demonstrations , or become serfs .
We have been in a steady economic decline for decades .
The Canadian political philosopher John Ralston Saul detailed this decline in his 1992 book “ Voltaire ’s Bastards : The Dictatorship of Reason in the West . ” David Cay Johnston exposed the mirage and rot of American capitalism in “ Free Lunch : How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense ( and Stick You With the Bill ) , ” and David C. Korten , in “ When Corporations Rule the World ” and “ Agenda for a New Economy , ” laid out corporate malfeasance and abuse .
But our universities and mass media , entranced by power and naively believing that global capitalism was an unstoppable force of nature , rarely asked the right questions or gave a prominent voice to those who did .
Our elites hid their incompetence and loss of control behind an arrogant facade of specialized jargon and obscure economic theories .

Arduino on the command line
I ’ve lately been trying to compile Arduino projects from command line .
Primarily because the Arduino IDE was n’t working out of the box on 64 - bit Ubuntu ( 9.04 ) .
That problem was eventually solved , but I ’ve been meaning to move away from that IDE anyway .
After reading a lot of posts I finally ended up with a working solution .
In addition to arduino ( for 32 - bit linux ) , you need to get a couple of packages :
sudo apt - get install avg - gcc sudo apt - get install avr - libc sudo apt - get install python- serial
You ’ll find hardware / cores / arduino / Makefile under the Arduino folder .
This one is meant to serve as a basis for your own projects .
I had to make some modifications to it , in addition to what was described in the file .
You can get my Makefile , which basically just splits the $ AVT_TOOLS_PATH into two separate paths .
A key point that was hard to figure out , was that the Arduino needs to be reset right before a program is uploaded .
This is automatically done by the IDE , but not by the Makefile .
If this is not in place , you ’ll get error messages like :
stk500_recv( ) : programmer is not responding
or
avrdude : stk500_getsync( ) : not in sync : resp=0x16 avrdude : stk500_disable ( ) : protocol error , expect=0x14 , resp=0x34
I made a tiny python script to reset the arduino :
import serial import time import sys if len( sys.argv ) !=
2 : print " Please specify a port , e.g. %s /dev/ttyUSB0 " % sys.argv[ 0 ] sys.exit( - 1 ) ser = serial .
Serial( sys.argv[ 1 ] ) ser.setDTR( 1 ) time.sleep( 0.5 ) ser.setDTR(0 ) ser.close ( )
Save this as pulsedtr.py , move it to somewhere in your $ PATH and do chmod u+x pulsedtr.py , then place it in the Makefile under upload ( Make sure you replace spaces with tabs if you copy from below ) :
upload : applet / $( TARGET ) .hex pulsedtr.py $ ( PORT ) $ ( AVRDUDE ) $( AVRDUDE_FLAGS ) $ ( AVRDUDE_WRITE_FLASH )
This was all that was needed for me to be able to make upload .
Let me know if you have any problems .
Update : After using the Makefile for a little while , I realized that the dependencies are a bit wrong .
This is fixed now .
Update :
If you happen to be replacing the Arduino IDE with Vim , I just uploaded an Arduino syntax file .
George W. Bush , over his eight years , took tax and budget policy to the crony - capitalist limit .
His White House racked up $ 5 trillion in national debt by waging reckless wars , shoveling lush contracts and bailouts to corporate and Wall Street insiders , and , perhaps most arrogantly of all , slashing already - low tax rates on the incomes of the super rich .
Few Americans realize just how incredibly little , historically speaking , our nation 's wealthy now pay in taxes .
In 1955 , America 's top 400 taxpayers paid a three - times greater percentage of their income in taxes than did the top 400 of 2006 , the most recent year with IRS data available .
This means that if the top 400 of 2006 had paid taxes at 1955 rates , the federal treasury would have collected -- from these 400 taxpayers alone -- an additional $ 35.9 billion more in revenue in 2006 .
The 139,000 U.S. taxpayers who made over $ 2 million in 2006 averaged $ 6 million in income .
They paid 23 percent of their total incomes in federal income tax .
The comparable rate for equivalent high - income Americans in 1955 : 49 percent of their income – more than twice as much !
We 've now lived through 30 years of " shrink , shift and shaft " federal budget and tax policies .
Right - wing pols , aided by Democrats who should have known better , have shrunk government and the share of taxes paid by the wealthiest 1 percent .
The tax burden , consequently , has shifted off wealth and onto wages , off the federal tax system and onto the regressive tax systems of states and localities .
The direct result : States and localities have gotten the budget shaft -- and that has forced years of chronic underfunding for mass transit , education and myriad public services .
So what can we do , as a nation , to start turning this situation around ?
Our Institute for Policy Studies report , Reversing the Great Tax Shift , described 3 steps that would generate over $ 450 billion in additional annual revenue -- dollars that would help finance our recovery fairly :
1 . Tax income from capital gains and dividends at the same rates as wage income .
Under current law , income from investments gets taxed at 15 percent .
Income from work gets taxed at up to 35 percent .
No coherent moral justification exists for such an enormous tax preference for income from wealth .
According to Citizens for Tax Justice , taxing all forms of income the same would generate an additional $ 80 billion a year .
2. Create a new top tax rate for incomes over $ 2 million .
Presently , a person with an income of $ 300,000 faces the same tax rates as a person with an income of $ 3 million .
Instituting a top tax rate of 50 percent on incomes over $ 2 million would generate more than $ 60 billion a year .
3 . Levy a progressive estate tax on large fortunes .
The federal estate tax , our nation 's only levy on grand accumulations of private wealth , will expire in 2010 and revert to the 2000 status quo .
Lawmakers are n't going to let that happen -- if , for no other reason , to take inflation into account -- and that reality creates an opportunity to make the estate tax more progressive .
Therefore institute graduated tax rates on large estates , while exempting estates worth less than $ 2 million , $ 4 million for a couple .
Such an approach would generate over $ 100 billion a year a decade from now -- while taxing no more than 1 of every 200 estates .
Polls show that these three steps would enjoy widespread public support .
Our grandparents seriously taxed the rich and economic growth was at a maximum .
Why can't we do the same ?
All stats have been taken from a recent Alternet article by Chuck Collins and Sam Pizzigati , scholars at the Institute for Policy Studies :

TVNorge have done reasearch that shows a loss of about 10 % of the viewers on the series “ Lost ” to filesharing and bittorrent .
I am puzzled by the fact that the big studios do n’t get the point .
If they have a look at the music industry they can see parts of the solution .
One of them is called iTunes Music Store .
Or , to be very precise : legal and user friendly alternatives .
The reason why so many people downloaded Lost here in Norway is the fact that we got the episodes months behind the US .
So , the brilliant story telling in Lost became the biggest motivation for download of new episodes from the net .
The people in the movie and television industry are wizards at visual communication .
In a hope that they might get the point I have taken up the art of comic drawing .
Something that I have not done since the age of 14 .
You can clearly see that in my story about Bob the Millionaire , but the message is the important stuff here .
The strip about Bob the Millionaire is based on a true story .
And , Bob the Millionaire is in for a very pleasant surprise :
Do - you - get - it ?
Bob could not resist .
And as a bonus he gets the episodes in a quality that no Norwegian television stations can give you today .
Related post :
Help for the left behind Yes , they will release Lost on DVD in Norway , but what quality ?
Probably standard definition .
So , even if it was possible to buy Lost you would get better quality through BitTorrent … Hello ?
Anybody home ?
And , here ’s a list of simple hints for the movie industry : 1 . As already mentioned : make user friendly , high quality alternatives to illegal download 2 .
Remember : the world is connected ! :
The system of different regions on DVD was a bad idea even at the point where DVD was born back in 1996 :
To even think about dividing the planet into something other than 6 billion potential viewers is utterly ridiculous 3 . Availability !
People want to play their content on all their devices
Feel free to add more hints to the movie industry here by adding comments .
I think the worst kept secret in the political world was made official today with veteran Republican Senator Arlen Specter switching his party affiliation to become a Democrat .
To me , this is more of a survival tactic played by the senator since he was more than likely going to lose the upcoming republican primary for the 2010 election .
Now if you are the democrats , you welcome him and take him in with open arms because he is one of the most respected people in congress regardless of which political hat he decides to wear .
However , with the GOP fighting with every last breath they have to keep Al Franken from being seated in Minnesota , the problem still remains of having 60 seats to prevent a filibuster .
Specter probably would have voted in line with the democrats against a filibuster even if he did n’t switch so it does n’t really solve anything .
In turn , Specter probably gets a less competitive primary challenge on this side or the aisle with the party backing him in the 2010 race .
Now if you are one of the very few moderates remaining on the conservative side , this really just brings to the forefront most of the problems you are facing .
There is no longer exists such a thing as a moderate Republican .
It ’s either you are with the extreme right wing base with the likes of Limbaugh , Hannity , O’Reilly and Bachmann and that is a real shame .
It should n’t matter if the vast majority of the people in this country are leaning moderately or completely liberal now , there should always be a respectable and honest but not lunatic opposition on the other side .
You should have base a voice of reason from the minority to keep the party in power of over - extending their reach of power but we just do n’t have that anymore in this country and it is quite a shame .
I have always tried to respect a person ’s view within reason regardless of whether I agreed with it or completely disagreed because the critics always tell you your faults .
They may not necessarily express in the way you might like it , but more likely than not they will tell you something about trying to appeal to more people .
It ’s quite unfortunate that a vast majority just disregards the republican minority now as nothing but a party of no but that is nobody ’s fault but the Republican Party ’s .
They have , for far too long relied on the politics of fear and isolation to shove their legislation through and the masses have finally woken up .
As a self - identified moderate liberal , I think it is more important in today ’s times than ever which so many politicians getting caught up in a power struggle rather than representing their constituents .
Living in one of the very few political systems that institutes a two - party system which is quite undemocratic as it is , and now having one of the two parties run by people who have extremists views is not a step in the right direction of democracy in this country .
Since the 3rd parties can only spout off their mouths and exert very little influence into the political system that is in play right now , it is that much more crucial to moderate and reform the conservative base .
The Republicans will need a purge sooner or later of these people with radical fundamentalist views at the forefront and the public face of its party .
As the next generation of younger constituents who are naturally more liberal to begin with begin to grow up , the GOP faces a major threat of facing the situation they had a couple of decades ago where they are down to 150 seats in congress .
You already notice the slight change with the likes of Megan McCain calling for the Roves of her party to step away since they are no longer relevant and are hurting the progressive cause of their party .
As for people my age , two of the most conservative people I know are shifting their views in polar opposite directions .
One is becoming much more liberal fiscally and towards economic policies to support a system where the government plays a bigger role in helping people get back up on their feet .
On the other hand , the other one is becoming more and more conservative by the day .
You almost get a feel of an old and battered athlete who does n’t know when to retire and admit his time has come and gone .
Resorting to out of context quotes and unsubstantiated rumors as “ facts ” to try to pick up any dirt or score cheap points in a political discussion .
Now for Senator Specter , we will very quickly find out whether he jumped ship simply to save and extend his political career or whether his political philosophy has really become more in line with the Democrats .
SEOUL , South Korea  Escalating its anti-foreign vitriol , North Korea threatened on Wednesday to shoot down American military planes it said were spying on the site of its impending rocket launching .
In mid-March , North Korea ’s regime announced that it would launch a satellite into orbit between Saturday and next Wednesday .
Since then , it has warned that any attempt to interrupt the launching will be considered an act of war .
“ If the brigandish U.S. imperialists dare to infiltrate spy planes into our airspace to interfere with our peaceful satellite launch preparations , our revolutionary armed forces will mercilessly shoot them down , ” the North ’s state - run Korea Central Radio said .
The broadcast accused the United States of deploying RC - 135 surveillance aircraft to spy on the Musudan - ri launch site near the North ’s northeast coast .
North Korea regularly accuses American surveillance aircraft of intruding into its airspace , a claim the United States military dismisses as propaganda .
Its threats to shoot them down reflects the overall tension between the United States and North Korea over the planned rocket launching .
Today President Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America
Act into law .
It will take affect October 1 of this year .
Read more about the Act .
During one of the most exciting National Volunteer Weeks in recent memory , President Obama and national service supporters gathered today at the SEED School in Washington , D.C. , an academic and boarding charter school .
At the signing , Obama said , our “ government cannot do everything alone , ” but needs the help of citizens in local communities everywhere .
And national service is n’t just for recent college graduates ( watch news footage from AARP . )
Sounding Whitman - esque , he called people every where to “ Put your shoulder to the wheel ” of service — and if you do , you can look back on the “ moment when your own story and the American story converged . ”
He also recognized Bill Clinton for launching AmeriCorps during his administration , and the First Lady Michelle Obama who was the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago , a national service program .
Obama went on to talk about the long legacy of service contributed by the Kennedy family including Ted Kennedy , for whom the legislation is now named .
He also introduced Maria Eitel his nominee for the new chief executive post at the Corporation for National and Community Service ( CNCS ) and Acting C.E.O. Nicola Goren .
The bill re-authorizes CNCS and its programs through 2014 , and authorizes sweeping expansion of national service ( with a nod to international service ) and aims not only to give hundreds of thousands of Americans an opportunity to dedicate their time and talent to their communities , but also to leverage exponentially more local volunteers and resources to improve the lives of millions of people in the United States .
Alan Khazei — the major force behind the Service Nation movement that brought together service , nonprofit , and even military groups — calls the signing of the Serve America Act , “ a milestone for the service movement , and the largest expansion of civilian service since the Depression Era Civilian Conservation Corps ” in today ’s Huffington Post .
( Listen to an interview from today , with Khazei and the Chronicle of Philanthropy reporter Suzanne Perry . )
In a statement she issued last week , Acting C.E.O. of the Corporation for National and Community Service Nicola Goren reminded the national service community that :
There are two broad points about implementation that we would like to emphasize .
First , the law goes into effect on October 1 , 2009 , not on the day the President signs it .
Congress chose this date to provide time for the Corporation and the national service field to plan and prepare for the extensive changes established in the law , and to coincide with the beginning of the next fiscal year .
Second , the Serve America
Act is an authorization bill , not an appropriations bill .
It makes changes in the underlying statutes that shape our programs and sets funding thresholds , but it does not itself fund them .
The actual funding is set through the annual appropriations process .
The President ’s detailed budget request for FY 2010 , expected later this spring , will be the starting point for that process , which will culminate in the fall .
We will be working closely with Congress and the White House throughout this process to support the budget proposed by the President .
According to a thorough explanation of the legislation ( and the movement behind it ) in the Chronicle of Philanthropy , the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementing the Serve America
Act will cost close to $ 6 billion over five years .
The Kennedy Serve America
Act will :
Ask many more Americans to give a year to solve specific challenges ( participation in the program will not be mandatory as has been rumored in some circles ) :
Building on the success of AmeriCorps , the legislation will create new “ corps ” focused on areas of national need .
It will ask 175,000 more Americans to give a year of service through these corps as part of a new national commitment to solve these challenges , expanding the number of national service participants to 250,000 by the fiscal year 2017 .
Increase opportunities to serve by people of all ages :
The legislation will improve opportunities for young people in low income , high - need communities to engage in service to improve their own communities .
It will dramatically expand service opportunities over the next eight years to 250,000 .
It increases the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award level , and pegs it to the maximum level of the Pell Grant .
For working adults , encourage employers to let employees serve , by establishing a tax incentive for employers who allow employees to take paid leave for full - time service .
For retirees , value their skills and make service work for them .
Many retiring citizens are ready , willing , and able to be involved in service and have skills the public needs , as evidenced by those who already serve through the current Senior Corps Programs .
The legislation will build upon the existing framework and enhance incentives for retirees to give a year of service through the new corps , and will establish “ Encore Fellowships ” that help retirees transition to longer - term public service .
For Americans of all ages , increase volunteering .
Not all Americans can make a significant time commitment to service , but many volunteer in other ways .
The legislation will expand the volunteer pool by establishing a “ Volunteer Generation Fund ” to help nonprofit organizations recruit and manage more volunteers .
The legislation will strengthen agency management to support the expansion .
Support social innovators in the nonprofit sector :
The legislation will recognize and support the role of effective social entrepreneurs like Wendy Kopp ( founder of Teach For America ) who are experimenting with new solutions to pressing problems :
Establish a commission to study and improve how the federal government , nonprofits , and the private sector work together to meet national challenges effectively .
Apply effective business strategies to the nonprofit sector , by establishing a network of “ Community Solution Funds ” that are basically venture capital funds to help the nonprofit sector seek talent and put it to work .
Improve and expand short - term international service for skilled professionals :
Support for short - term international service opportunities :
While many legislators behind the Serve America Act support the strengthening of Peace Corps , the Act itself does n’t authorize that .
The legislation does aim to strengthen the Volunteers for Prosperity , which coordinates and supports short - term international service opportunities for skilled professionals to serve in developing nations .

Representatives in the North Dakota House have voted to leave gays and lesbians exposed to discrimination .
Lawmakers voted 54 to 34 to reject a measure that sought to ban discrimination in the areas of housing , employment and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation .
Senate Bill 2278 was introduced by Senator Tom Fiebiger , a Democrat from Fargo , on January 19 and won approval by the Republican - led Senate by a 27 - 19 vote .
Fiebiger , the father of a gay son , told The Concordian that passage of a gay protections law had become his “ passion ” in recent years .
The bill defined sexual orientation as the “ actual or perceived heterosexuality , bisexuality , homosexuality , or gender identity ” of a person .
The term “ gender expression ” appeared in the original draft of the bill but looks to have been removed in the final reading .
Religious groups would have been exempt from the law 's provisions .
Opponents said the law would have meant a state endorsement of a “ lifestyle choice . ”
“ [ Being gay or lesbian ] is not something that you 're born with , that you have no choice in , ” said Rep. Robin Weisz , a Republican from Hurdsfield , told the AP .
“ It is a behavior , and it is a lifestyle choice . ”
The Focus on the Family - related North Dakota Family Alliance said the bill would “ provide for special status , not equality ” and would be “ detrimental ” to religious liberties and organizations .
Other opponents took aim at the bill 's inclusion of transgender people , arguing such protections would allow sexual predators access to children .
“ This is a bill that begins to confuse the gender differences between men and women to the point of trying to allow men to use women 's restrooms , and , of course , that means sexual predators going after young children , ” Tom Minnery , senior vice president of public policy at Focus on the Family Action , said in a radio message .
Republicans hold a nearly 2 - to - 1 majority in the House .
SHUANGYAO , China --
The global slowdown is taking a toll on China , claiming the jobs of an estimated 20 million migrant workers and dimming their prospects as they set out in search of work after the New Year holiday .
The year ahead appears no more promising : Officials forecast the number of migrants looking for jobs will reach at least 25 million .

Superconductivity Record Tops 240K High - Tc Advances More Than 100 Degrees in 3 Years
Superconductors .ORG
herein reports efforts to increase the Tc of the 233 K superconductive material , announced in March 2009 , have been successful .
Producing a new world record near 242K ( - 24 F , - 31C ) , the host compound has the formula ( Tl 4 Ba ) Ba 4 Ca 2 Cu 10 O y and is believed to have a 9212/2212C intergrowth structure ( shown below left ) .
The chemical formula is written ( Tl 4 Ba ) Ba 4 to indicate an extra barium atom is being substituted into a thallium atomic site .
The purpose behind this 20 % substitution is to hole - dope the insulating layer .
Potential heavy metal dopants with oxidation states lower than +3 included mercury , cadmium and barium .
However , both mercury and cadmium create a topological defect in the structure due to their affinity for other atomic sites .
This left barium as the best candidate for doping .
Several magnetization tests confirmed a phase change in this material consistent with superconductivity .
A sharp drop in magnetic susceptibility was observed between 248K and 249 K , as can be seen in the above plot .
Since barium is lighter than thallium , the planar weight ratio of the 242 K structure is lower than that of the 233 material ( 19:1 vs 20:1 ) .
However , the increased hole content overcomes this setback , producing a net gain in Tc .
A weak resistive transition appeared near 234 K in some of the R - T plots ( as shown above ) .
This is believed to result from a 7212/2212C structure forming as a minority phase .
Plotting both the 242K and 234K signals based on the planar weight ratios of their structures yielded the below graph .
The slope of the line linking ( Tl3 Ba ) and ( Tl4 Ba ) is not parallel with the ( Tl4 ) - ( Tl5 ) lines due to ( Tl3 Ba ) being optimally doped at 25 % , while ( Tl4 Ba ) is under - doped at 20 % .
Note :
Only whole number doping is viable in these intergrowth structures .
This discovery is being released into the public domain without patent protection in order to encourage other researchers to examine this material and its structure .
Numerous R- T and magnetization tests may be necessary to see the respective transitions above the noise .
After 4 or 5 tests , the pellet may need to be dried out for a couple days before testing again .
These " 3rd day " tests often produce the best results .
Synthesis of these materials was by the solid state reaction method .
Stoichiometric amounts of the below precursors were mixed , pelletized and sintered for 34 hours at 865C .
The pellet was then annealed for 10 hours at 500C in flowing O2 .

The magnetometer employed twin Honeywell SS94A1F
Hall - effect sensors with a tandem sensitivity of 50 mv / gauss .
The 4 - point probe was bonded to the pellet with CW2400 silver epoxy and used 7 volts on the primary .
RESEARCH NOTE :
The copper - oxides are strongly hygroscopic .
All tests should be performed immediately after annealing .

Abstract in LaTeX format :
This paper surveys results in the design and analysis of self - organizing
data structures for the search problem .
We concentrate on two simple but
very popular data structures : the unsorted linear list and the binary search
tree .
A self - organizing data structure has a rule or algorithm for
changing pointers or state data .
The self - organizing rule is designed to
get the structure into a good state so that future operations can be
processed efficiently .
Self - organizing data structures differ from constraint
structures in that no structural invariant , such as a balance constraint in
a binary search tree , has to be satisfied .
In the area of self - organizing linear lists we present a series of
deterministic and randomized on - line algorithms .
We concentrate on
competitive algorithms , i.e. , algorithms that have a guaranteed performance
with respect to an optimal offline algorithm .
In the area of binary search trees we present both on - line and off - line
algorithms .
We also discuss a famous self - organizing
on - line rule called splaying and present important theorems and
open conjectures on splay trees .
In the third part of the paper we show
that algorithms for self - organizing lists and trees can be used to build
very effective data compression schemes .
We report on theoretical
and experimental results .

Billy Bob Thornton elicited boos and catcalls last night at Massey Hall as he attempted to explain his bizarre behaviour during an interview on CBC Radio on Wednesday .
Referring to Jian Ghomeshi , the host of CBC Radio's Q , as an " a - - hole , " the Oscar - winning actor turned musician interrupted his band 's set three songs in to give his side of the story .
After commenting on the beautiful theatre and the legendary performer they were opening for ( Willie Nelson ) , Thornton said , " It seems as if when I say something it 's in the news . "
When that drew boos , Thornton continued : " Boo all you want , but I want to say something ....
We 're really happy to be here , but I need to say something .
I talked to this a -- hole yesterday .
" I sat down and talked with this guy .
He and his producers say , ` We promise you we wo n't say that ' ( meaning references to Thornton 's acting career ) .
The very first thing they said was that .
" I do n't really like sensationalism , " he added .
" If you look someone in the eyes and promise them something , and you do n't do it , you do n't get the interview .
That 's the way it goes . "
The explanation was met by further boos and catcalls of , " Here comes the gravy , " a reference to Thornton 's description of Canadian audiences as " mashed potatoes with no gravy " during his interview with Ghomeshi .
Before the show , Thornton told a Star reporter that he " loves Canada . "
When asked what he meant by the mashed potatoes comment , Thornton , wearing a thick layer of skin - tone facial makeup and sucking on a cigarette , said : " I was talking about the guy who was interviewing me . "
The interview , which featured Thornton claiming he did n't know what some of Ghomeshi 's questions meant , responding to others with non-sequiturs , then chastising Ghomeshi for referring to the actor 's film career , has gone viral .
More than 600,000 viewers had watched the clip on YouTube by 8 p.m. yesterday , while a CBC spokesperson said the network had received roughly 3,700 blog responses and emails .
Before last night 's show , the second in which the Boxmasters opened for Nelson and Ray Price , several fans were miffed at Thornton 's radio performance .
" He 's an a -- hole , " said Nick Goodman of Aurora .
" He was probably drinking backstage or something . "
Danny Duckworth of Toronto said he likes Thornton as a comedian and actor , but " I could n't care less what he thinks .
If I want to get up and dance , that 's my choice , " he added , a reference to Thornton 's comment that Canadians just sort of sit there .
" If Billy Bob does n't like it , he should quit . "
Ghomeshi could not be reached for comment last night .
Earlier yesterday , he said it was one of the most difficult interviews he 's ever done and he was taken aback at Thornton 's strange responses ( sample : when Ghomeshi asked when the Boxmasters were formed , Thornton answered , " I 'm not sure what that means " ) .
Ghomeshi also said it would have been irresponsible to his audience not to mention Thornton 's acting past during his introduction ( he did not ask any questions about acting during the interview ) .
" Our policy is that we do n't allow anybody to tell us what we can and cannot say , " said Ghomeshi .
" Beyond that , it was this notion and the language that he used during the interview that I thought was unfortunate , that we were `instructed ' to say this and that .
And I think that does raise interesting questions about ideas around how much journalism is to be controlled , especially when it comes to arts and entertainment and culture , and I think that that 's a concern .
" The reality is , and I tried to explain this in the interview , these guys have only been together for two years .
You just do n't get the kind of national press they are getting without the incentive being something like his career past ....
And I think if he could graciously accept that and say , `Hey , I want to focus on the music , but I get that the reason we 're here is because I 'm a movie star that 's won an Oscar . '
There 's not a lot of people who can say that . "
Ghomeshi felt like he was " in the middle of a tsunami " yesterday .
He was being interviewed by media around the world .
" The nice thing is the reaction that I 'm getting from journalists around the world that is really kind of sweet , but it is all very odd ... and a lot of people , especially in this country , seemed to support the way I did things , " he said .
" Maybe it was a little Canadian to be polite , but I can live with that . "

Thornton 's interview was being compared to the recent Joaquin Phoenix appearance , in which the actor turned rapper sulked through a chat on Late Show With David Letterman .

I attach an XEDS plot for red material from a red / gray chip found in
WTC dust -- a separate sample from any of the FOUR in our paper , from

His results confirm several major features of our results ( compare our

Notice that there is NO magnesium or chromium in this material so that
it can not be the Tnemec paint identified by Dr. Greening .

I AGREE THAT THE PAINT ISSUE APPEARS TO BE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE OF
THE DEBUNKERS .
i have a ( possibly irrational ) fear that the bacon trend may be waning .
with the advent of bacon salt , bacolicio.us and any number of bacon blogs , a once underground community of bacon lovers is on the verge of going mainstream .
just last week , the new york times published an article on the bacon explosion , a giant roll of bacon wrapped in sausage wrapped yet again in bacon .
the times even recognized the absurdity of publishing the bacon explosion piece alongside another article about nyc ’s war on salt .
this leaves me a little worried that the bacon overload could go the way of pirates , ninjas , robots , monkeys and zombies , concepts that have just been driven into the ground , particularly by the internet masses .
i’m holding that bacon stays timeless and untouchable , which explains why i decided to make a recipe that combined candied bacon with chocolate chip cookies .
enough about my bacon fears , let ’s get to the recipe .
i was inspired to make candied bacon by david lebovitz , who combined it with ice cream .
i also found several recipes for bacon chocolate chip cookies , but they used ordinary bacon .
i wanted to take the decadence of candied bacon and insert it into the sweetness of a cookie .
dare i?
i dared .
the candied bacon by itself was overwhelmingly delicious , so much so that i could only eat a bite at a time without my taste buds exploding with joy .
i chopped up the bacon into tiny pieces and mixed it in with ordinary chocolate chip cookie batter ( the tollhouse recipe of course ) .
before i put them in the oven , i worried that the bacon would overtake the taste of the cookie and simply be too much to handle .
luckily , i was completely wrong .
in fact , what results is a very subtle bacon flavor that teams up with the chocolate chips to elevate the cookies – sweet and salty never disappoints .
you might want to canvas your friends before making a full batch of these though .
no matter how i explained the process , i got the same incredulous looks from everyone i told and could n’t get even one person to try a single cookie .
apparently , candied meat cookies are still ahead of their time , which means i have some work to do .
maybe this bacon trend is n’t on its way out quite yet .

Superb writing on art & design in games , with the fantastic bonus of giving away actual art resources you can use in your own games !
Infrequent posts but totally worthwhile .
Out of all this discussion about graphics , never lose sight of the big picture .
The single most important thing is for you to finish your game .
Iterating towards completion is the root of all practical knowledge about game development .
Putting a complete game in the hands of player is how you 'll learn to make your future games shake the world to its core .
If you are telling yourself " Oh , I can't complete my game because I do n't have an artist , " be honest with yourself .
You are making excuses .
Graphics are not an impediment to making a great game .
Do what ever it takes to finish your game .

Jeff Vogel has been making old - school single player RPGs since 1994 but only started blogging this year .
A treasure trove of insight for indie game developers already , and will only get better .
I am going to give full sales results for our game Geneforge 4 : Rebellion .
I am not the first Indie developer to reveal this sort of information .
However , most public sales figures come from projects that were either blockbusters or disastrous .
But our games have never landed in either pool .
I have been doing this for a living for almost fifteen years .
I make good money , but I 'm not a rich guy .
At the same time , I have been unusually successful in this business , if for nothing else that I HAVE done it for a living for a long time .

Interesting business - themed articles , particularly about charging models for MMOs , microtransactions & virtual goods .
Despite my obvious affection for virtual asset sales in a free - to - play model , I do n’t think the decision to go free - to - play or subscription ( or one of a myriad of other business models for MMOs ) is that simple .
It ’s not purely about whether you ’re reaching a larger audience and I do n’t believe it ’s a given that you ’ll make more money , overall , with the free - to - play model .
I think it ’s largely dependent on the game you make and the audience that ends up developing for it .

Love the epic rants .
More please !
You would n’t wax philosphical about how you ’ll dilute the intellectual property or how the fanbase will criticize you for selling out .
You ’re running an advertising - based world , and as far as advertising goes , Coke is the holy grail .
You will relax your muscles and allow the Coca - Cola corporation to ram its fistfuls of hot , sweaty cash wherever it so chooses .

Great all - rounder blog covering business & technical advice with a slant towards Flash games .
The ultimate question for a sponsor is , “ How much traffic will this game drive to my site ? ”
The quality of your game is ultimately only important with regard to its potential distribution / viral spread , and its viral spread is only important with regard to how many clicks this will generate .
But the CTR is crucial as well .
A game with 1 million plays and a 5 % CTR is not as valuable to a sponsor as a game with 600,000 plays and a 10 % CTR .
So show your sponsor what kind of CTR your game can drive .
Put in some placeholder branding .
Show where the links will be .
If you ’re willing to offer some exclusive content , show the sponsor — make one version with the content unlocked , and another version with it locked and what the link back to the sponsor ’s site to play this content will look like .
Do n’t wait for a sponsor to request these things .

One executive at a top UK bank who did n't want to be named for fear of angering the IRS said : " It 's just about manageable under the current system - and that 's because we 're big .
The danger to us is suddenly being hauled over the coals by the IRS for a client that has n't paid proper taxes .

Pic General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc ( GA - ASI ) , maker of the famous Predator and Reaper unmanned warplanes , has taken the wraps off a new and still more powerful kill - robot - the " Avenger " .
The company says that first flights have been conducted successfully this month .
Avenger .
Well , it was n't going to be called Serenity or something , was it ?
For a full hi-res , click here .
The Avenger , also known as Predator - C , has been developed with GA - ASI 's own money , as was the successful Reaper ( Predator - B ) before it .
GA - ASI 's philosophy is to build what the company thinks the US military will actually need for operations , rather than trying to build what the services say they want .
“ Our company has been uniquely successful in forecasting military needs and delivering extremely capable unmanned aircraft that are ready for near - term military use , " says Thomas Cassidy Jr , GA - ASI president .
" Just as the first Predator B aircraft were developed and flown on IRAD [ Internal Research and Development ] funding because we saw the need for this type of capability , likewise , Avenger was developed through foresight and significant company investment . ”
This philosophy has stood GA - ASI in good stead during the last ten years : the firm has managed to place a big force of unmanned warplanes with the US Air Force , which left to itself would probably not have bothered .
The original Predator is now turning into an almost hands - off Army aircraft , the Sky Warrior , set to operate without benefit of expensive pilots trained in manned aircraft : the enlarged , turboprop - powered Predator - B ( known as Reaper in the USAF ) carries a lot more weapons and flies much higher .
Now comes the Avenger , upgraded to jet propulsion and offering some Stealth features .
GA - ASI say that it is " more survivable in higher threat environments " and say that it " will have higher operational and transit speeds than current Predator - series aircraft , resulting in fast response and rapid repositioning " .
The firm promises 400 - knot airspeeds and a 60,000 - foot ceiling using the Pratt & Whitney PW545B turbofan ( the same used in the Cessna Citation XLS biz jet ) .
The Avenger can be flown using the same control stations as its predecessors , and " can carry the same mix of weapons as Predator B " - that is , laser - guided Hellfire missiles or Paveway / JDAM smartbombs .
It will also be suitable for carrying any of the various advanced sensors - ground - sweeping radars , thermal imagers , multiplex Argus spyeyes , mobile - phone sniffers etc. - nowadays so popular for airborne surveillance .
It 's a biggish brute , 41 feet long and with a 66 - foot wingspan - comparable in size to an F - 15 fighter plane , but wide rather than long .
As can be seen in the pic above , supplied to the Reg by GA - ASI , the Avenger has an arrester hook ; it might one day operate from aircraft carriers as well as runways .
Avenger should be harder to see on radar or infrared - search - and - track than its predecessors , with the engine hidden between V tailfins ( plus no propellor ) and its weapons carried internally .
However , it is n't a full - blown Stealth design , as a look at the undercarriage doors alone will confirm .
The better " survivability " spoken of by GA - ASI probably refers as much to the improved ceiling ( 60,000 feet is too high for some anti-aircraft missiles the US forces might encounter someday ) as to radar cross-section .
Under the new Obama Pentagon roadmap lately announced by Defence Secretary Gates , the unmanned - warplane fleet was moved out of supplementary funding and into the core budget .
It 's now official that robot planes are here to stay , rather than being a temporary measure as some pilots might have hoped .
Meanwhile the CIA - the original user of armed Predators - is mounting a serious , nominally - secret bombing campaign in the Pakistani borderlands using its drone fleet .
It seems likely that GA - ASI are correct in thinking that the Avenger will find a market , despite the fact that nobody in the Pentagon has got round to asking for it yet . ®
The lake that Cupid made ( after global warming had melted the glacier )
It seems an unlikely place to find such a symbol of romance .
But Mother Nature chose this bleakly beautiful Arctic landscape to leave her mark in the form of a stunning heart - shaped lake .
It has emerged as climate change melted the glacier that covered the area .
Blocks of ice trapped during the glacier ’s retreat caused the ground to cave in , creating a heart - like hollow , some 120 ft by 90ft , that then filled with rainwater or snow melt .
The picture was taken by French photographer Bruno Mazodier on Spitsbergen , the largest island in the Svalbard archipelago .
Pool of love :
The lake at Borebukta on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen emerged after a glacier melted
The Norwegian island 620 miles from the North Pole is the most northerly inhabited - place on Earth , although people are outnumbered by polar bears .
Dr Bryn Hubbard , of Aberystwyth University , said : ‘ The glaciers all through this island chain have receded , but the heart shape is an anomaly .
You would do well to find another . ’
As astronauts work to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope this week , another large space telescope of NASA started a new life on its own .
As expected , on May 15th , 2009 , the Spitzer Space Telescope ran out of its liquid helium coolant that has enabled it to observe dark , cold objects both within and outside of the solar system with ultra - high sensitivity .
This does n't mean that the telescope is nearing the end of its life ; rather , it merely switches the mission from the “ cold ” phase it has been in since launch to a new " warm " phase , with new scientific objectives .
This is actually a big week for infrared astronomy .
The European Space Agency launched two space - based IR telescopes of its own , the Herschel Space Observatory ( HSO ) and the Planck mission .
The HSO is armed with the largest mirror ever put into space , at 3.5 m , approximately four times the size of Spitzer 's .
It 's carrying three years ' worth of coolant that will allow it to image deeper into the infrared , pushing close to radio astronomy wavelengths .
With the Spitzer now shifting to the shorter - wavelength ranges of the IR , the HSO and Spitzer missions will largely complement each other .
The Planck satellite also observes in the far - infrared , but its goal is to measure the cosmic microwave background radiation .
Both HSO and Planck are on a four - month trip to the L2 Lagrange point , during which time ESA scientists should have the chance to calibrate their instruments .
The Spitzer telescope is part of NASA ’s Great Observatories Program , which is made up of four space - based telescopes which together cover the full - spectrum of light from far - infrared to gamma-ray radiation .
The other three are the Hubble Space Telescope ( covering the visible and near - ultraviolet ) , Chandra X-ray Observatory ( soft X- ray ) , and Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ( hard X - ray and gamma ray ) ,
The Spitzer Space Telescope covers the infrared part of the spectrum .
Astronomical objects that shine primarily in infrared are mostly cold , dark objects .
To observe these stellar bodies , a telescope ’s detector must be as cold as possible , as the thermal noise within the detector itself can otherwise overwhelm the very photons that come from the objects of interest .
The Spitzer has been peering at those cold cosmic targets by chilling its light detectors to just 5.5 Kelvin above absolute zero using liquid helium , the coldest cryogen that we have .
The telescope was launched on August 25th , 2003 , carrying 360 litters ( 96 gallons ) of the cryogen , which was originally meant to last for at least 2.5 years with a hope of stretching it to 5 years .
Achieving almost 6 years of cold - phase mission is beyond these original expectations .
Even without the cryogen , the Spitzer ’s capabilities in the mid-infrared are not expected to degrade at all , as that detector is designed to maintain temperatures below 30 Kelvin even without the liquid helium .
These capabilities will not be surpassed by NASA until the James Webb Space Telescope becomes operational sometime after 2013 .
What the telescope will lose is its ability to see objects in far - infrared — it can no longer see some of the darkest objects it revealed during the cold phase .
Unlike the Hubble , which is in low - Earth orbit , the Spitzer orbits around the sun just behind Earth , and cannot be reached by the Shuttle to replenish the supplies and upgrade the instruments .
I found the most amazing thing in the parking lot of a gas station yesterday .
Now do n’t get me wrong , I ’ve found some pretty amazing things on the ground– mostly money , a few tens , a few twenties , things that people lose but do n’t usually go back for or ca n’t claim at a lost and found .
Yesterday , I found a Nintendo DS .
I have to admit , my first thought was something along the lines of “ Holy– sweet ! ” but as I turned the thing over in my hands and looked at it , realizing what a prize I ’d found , it also struck me as what a prize someone else had lost .
I ’ve seen DS ’s in the store– they ’re not cheap , and they ’re certainly out of my spending range .
“ Should I keep it ? ” I wondered .
It was a sure bet that I probably would n’t get a chance to hold one in my hands again until Nintendo came out with something better and slashed the price on the DS to somewhere near reasonable , and by then it might not even matter anymore .
I stood there in the rain just looking at it for probably five seconds , torn .
And then my ethics kicked in .
I ’m not a religious person , but I live by one singular rule , a code that I think is valid in any situation where one is presented with a moral dilemma :
“ Do unto others as you would have them do unto you .
” So I took it into the gas station and gave it to the attendant , hoping that the person who lost it would come back looking for it and ask the attendant those hopeful words : “ Has anyone turned in a ... ” Because if it was my DS , I ’d hope , even expect someone else to do the same for me .
It ’s not a perfect world , there are plenty of unethical things going on everyday that we cannot change , but what we can do is teach by example .
We can live ethically , simply because to do otherwise is to be a douchebag , and if enough of us do it , we can change the world .
Every year , American businesses lose about $ 190 billion to fraud , making this a widespread issue .
As a company higher - up , you ’re going to want to take action to ensure that your business is n’t targeted .
This way , when criminals inevitably target your organization , you ’ll be prepared and protected .
For this reason , having good fraud detection software is essential to any growing business .
But what exactly is a fraud detection solution ?
That ’s what we ’re going to look at here today .
Read on to learn what fraud detection is and what the most effective technology is to combat these hackers and thieves .
How Does a Fraud Detection System Work ?
At the most basic level , a fraud detection system is a computerized technology that runs programs to identify whether money and resources are being taken from a company illegally or through false pretenses .
It will scan the software that you use for business operations along with your business transactions .
However , there ’s a lot more to fraud detection than that .
If malware tries to infiltrate your system , fraud detection software will alert you immediately .
Also , if there is any suspicious activity on business accounts or credit cards , it will automatically deny the transaction .
It then will alert you so that you can either give the transaction the green light or look further into the issue .
Since screening happens in real - time , fraud management software will catch these problems before they have the chance to cost your company money .

Okay , so we kid .
This ' chop was created for Freaking News , but we find it to be somewhat ironic considering all of the official and unofficial ' special edition '
Veyrons that have been released over the past few years .
We thought Ford owned the " No Special Edition Left Behind " moniker , but we are slowly learning that we were wrong .
So wrong .

Southern Poverty Law Center : 50 % rise in violent hate groups David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday April 15 , 2009
Print This Email This A new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) , which tracks the activities of violent hate groups in the United States , has found an alarming rise in the number of such groups , from 602 in 2000 to 926 in 2008 .
This comes on the heels of a controversial report on " violent extremism " from the Department of Homeland Security , which has outraged many conservatives by seeming to lump them in with extremists .
Morris Dees , the founder of the SPLC , told CBS 's Harry Smith on Wednesday that he believes the two reports do " synch up pretty much " and that " the report from the Department of Homeland Security should be taken very seriously . "
However , the SPLC 's own report focuses very narrowly on groups which actively preach violence , including neo -Nazis , the Ku Klux Klan , and the " racist skinhead subculture . "
It also notes the surprising rise of " anti-Semitic black separatists calling for death to Jews on bustling street corners in several East Coast cities . "
" A key 2008 hate group trend was the increasing militancy of the extremist fringe of the Hebrew Israelite movement , " the report states , " whose adherents believe that Jews are creatures of the devil and that whites deserve death or slavery .
These radical black supremacists have no love for Barack Obama , calling him a ' house nigger ' and a puppet of Israel .
They preach to inner-city blacks that evil Jews are solely responsible for the recession . "
Dees told Smith , " The political climate , the election of Obama , the immigration issues ... and now , especially , the economy is almost causing a resurgence of what we saw in the days of Timothy McVeigh , almost a militia movement that 's being reborn .
...
I think that an American person is much more likely to be harmed by a domestic terrorist extremist group than by one from abroad . "
Dees also emphasized that many extremist groups are recruiting Iraq veterans and even active - duty members of the military because of their expertise with arms and explosives .
" It 's a serious issue , " he stated , " especially with a lot of these guys coming back with post - traumatic stress syndrome , coming back to a failing economy , the inability to buy a home and get a job and get credit . "

I ’ve mentioned previously that one of the most important ingredients in a weight control program is more often implied than specifically mentioned : the role of psychological factors .
I know that for myself , I have learned that it takes me about four or five specific psychological “ tricks ” every day to stick to my program .
As I ’ve been working on this blog , I ’ve come to realize that I ’ve never really listed them all in one place before .
I assume that it ’s not just me .
It seems likely that for the vast majority of people , the psychological factors are key to sticking with and succeeding at any significant weight control program .
Think about it by way of an analogy :
Many of us have probably fantasized about some kind of “ full immersion environment ” that would literally force us to stick to all the tough weight loss “ rules ” we must follow to lose weight .
Maybe some “ fat farm ” resort where nutritionists prepare all your meals , and where you ’d have lots of free time and a trainer and an Olympic - quality gym to use every day .
Or maybe just join the military and they ’ll make you lose the weight at boot camp .
( I ’ve had students who tried this route . )
Or maybe some medicine that decreases your appetite and so takes away the hard “ psychological ” part of the process .
You may even consider surgery or stomach banding , mechanical processes that among other things , tend to powerfully reduce both your appetite and your capacity for eating too much .
In all these cases , what we are wanting to do is to get some external factor to essentially supplement or even to replace the psychological processes that others have managed to use to make their programs work .
Essentially , these alternatives take us out of the realm of having to make sure our “ heads ” and our behavior stick to the diet / exercise plan .
And there is absolutely nothing wrong with these alternatives .
Two of my close friends are preparing for surgery , and I ’m sure it ’ll be super helpful for them .
I ’ve considered it and discussed it with my medical advisers a few times .
People who do it often swear by it .
But suppose you decide it ’s not for you — not yet , anyway .
Or suppose boot camp is out of the question ( I ’m too old ) , or that you ca n’t afford six months at a spa ?
What then ?
It ’s likely that these are not , in fact , the solutions for the vast majority of people .
Most of us have to slog on as best we can , trying day after day to stick to the diet changes and exercise regimens we know are likely to work for us .
In that case , it may be helpful to list some of the psychological attitudes that can aid successful weight loss .
I have n’t done a systematic survey of these .
What I am going to list here are seven psychological factors that I have personally found to be helpful in weight control .
Your mileage may vary ; not all of these will be useful for you .
But this is the list that makes the most sense of this for me .
Maybe you ’ll find some of them helpful .
Briefly listed , they are :
1. Keeping weight loss a high priority
2. Persistence ( as an attitude , as well as a behavioral pattern )
3. Frustration tolerance
4. Rituals and positive focus
5. Feedback looping — an attitude of “ learning as you go ” and modifying what you do as a result
6 . Self - image : learning to see yourself in a new way ( as an athlete , as a thin person )
7. Motives : having clear reasons for what you do — what will you DO with this new , thin self when you have her / him ?
In future posts I ’ll talk about each of these , including the value of each attitude / habit and how you can go about systematically changing your thinking so that you can up the odds that you ’ll stick to your program .
None of these are things you just “ have ” or “ are ” — there is an element of skill in making each of them work for you .
Stay tuned for suggestions as to how to make the seven attitudes a part of who you are .

Skandinaver snakker nesten samme språk .
Men er det nordmenn , svensker eller dansker som forstår hverandre best ?
En undersøkelse utført av Nordisk språkråd prøver å komme til bunns i mysteriet , skriver Dagsavisen .
Du har kanskje opplevd om du møter andre skandinavere at det lett oppstår diskusjon om hvilket annet skandinavisk språk man forstår best .
Noen nordmenn synes dansk er enklere å forstå enn svensk , mens andre har motsatt oppfatning .
Og hva så med svensker .
Er norsk eller dansk lettest å forstå ?
- Nordmenn er skandinaviske mestere i nabospråkforståelse , sier Arne Torp til Dagsavisen .
- Norwegians are the masters in Scandinavia in understanding neighboring languages , says Arne Torp to Dagsavisen .
Han er førsteamanuensis i nordisk ved Universitetet i Oslo og har deltatt i utformingen av en språktest som er gjennomført i Norge , Sverige og Danmark .
Nordmenn , svensker og dansker fikk se en sekvens av tv-programmet « Vil du bli millionær » , de fikk lese en avisnotis og høre på en nyhetssendig .
Testgruppene fikk poeng ut fra hvor dyktige de var til å forstå hva som ble sagt og skrevet .
60 poeng var full pott .
Undersøkelsen viste at nordmenn hadde størst forståelse av de nordiske språkene .
Nesten en tredel bedre forståelse av de andre språkene enn svensker og dansker ble status når poengene var talt opp .
I 1976 , da man foretok en lignende test , kom også nordmenn best ut , skriver Dagsavisen .
Undersøkelsen viser at både svensker og dansker synes norsk er enklest å forstå .
I Sverige er det slik at de synes nynorsk er enklere å forstå enn bokmål .
Trolig skyldes det at svenskene har problemer å forstå dansk , og bokmål har større innslag av dansk språk enn nynorsk .
Nordmenn forstår litt bedre svensk enn dansk , viste undersøkelsen .
Forståelsen av norsk har bare økt siden 1976 , spesielt forstår svensker nordmenn bedre nå enn før .
- Det at vi har blitt rike på olje og at svenske arbeidere kommer hit for å arbeide kan ha endret synet på det , sier Torp til Dagsavisen .
Undersøkelsen viste også at de som bor på Østlandet forstår svensk veldig godt .
Trolig skyldes det at de har lett tilgang til svensk tv og at dansebandmusikk er populært på Østlandet .
In this post from last year I sourced a forum post that claimed the following :
But even though that forum post agreed with my own experiences , it was unsourced and I 've always wanted to find an actual study on the matter .
Yesterday I found one , from 2004 ( it also references a previous study from 1976 so even better ) .
Here 's what it says : Scandinavians speak almost the same language .
But is it Norwegians , Swedes or Danes that understand each other the best ?
A study done by the Nordisk språkråd attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery , writes Dagsavisen .
You might have experienced when you meet other Scandinavians that it is easy to get into the discussion on which other Scandinavian language is best understood .
Some Norwegians think Danish is easier to understand than Swedish , while others have the opposite opinion .
And what about Swedes ?
Is Norwegian or Danish easiest to understand ?
He is an associate professor in Nordic at the University of Oslo and has taken part in the designing of a language test conducted in Norway , Sweden and Denmark .
Norwegians , Swedes and Danes saw a sequence of the tv program " Who wants to be a millionaire " , read a newspaper notice and listened to a news broadcast .
The test groups received points for how well they understood what was said and written , with a maximum of 60 points .
The survey showed that Norwegians had the greatest understanding of the Nordic ( Scandinavian ) languages .
They had almost one third better understanding of the other languages than Swedes and Danes when the points were added up .
Norwegians also did best in 1976 when a similar test took place , writes Dagsavisen .
The survey shows that both Swedes and Danes see Norwegian as the easiest to understand .
In Sweden they found Nynorsk to be easier to understand than Bokmål ( note : these are the two official standards of the Norwegian language .
Bokmål is used by the majority and looks a lot like written Danish ) .
Perhaps that is because Swedes have problems understanding Danish , and Bokmål has a greater Danish element than Nynorsk .
The survey showed that Norwegians understand Swedish a bit better than Danish .
Understanding of Norwegian has only increased since 1976 , especially where Swedes understand Norwegians better now than before .-
The fact that we 've become rich in oil and that Swedish workers come here to work may have changed the outlook on it , said Torp to Dagsavisen .
The survey also showed that those living in Eastern Norway understood Swedish quite well .
This is probably because they have easy access to Swedish television and that dance music is popular in Eastern Norway .
Refuted economic doctrines # 8 : the superiority of flexible labor markets
According to the latest Eurostat data* , the unemployment rate in the US was equal to that in the EU - 15 in March , and is now likely to be higher .
Writing in the NY Times , Floyd Norris refers to the conventional wisdom that flexibility inherent in the American system — it is easier to both hire and fire workers than in many European countries implies that unemployment should be lower ( at any given point in the business cycle ) in the US than in Europe .
Although this is the conventional wisdom , the research on which it was based ( by Lazear and others ) has long since been qualified or refuted .
I looked at this in the context of the Australian debate about unfair dismissal laws a few years back .
Although the early research supported the simple view that more flexibility = more jobs , later research yielded the conclusion that employment protection laws lower the variance of employment and unemployment but have no clear effect on the average levels .
When you look at the institutions involved , this is unsurprising .
Although Norris refers to restrictions on hiring and firing , the reality is that restrictions on hiring are nowhere very important .
Even in the extreme case of Spain , they amount to a few weeks of salary .
The big differences are in costs of firing , and it is the anticipation of these costs that acts to constrain hiring in periods of expansion .
Advocates of the US system make much of the deterrent to hiring associated with employment protection laws , but they ignore the other side of the coin .
When the economy is contract , employment protection laws do in fact protect employment ( if they did not , they would have no adverse effect on hiring either ) .
On this basis there is nothing surprising in what we are seeing .
EU unemployment rates should be higher in expansions and lower in contractions , which is exactly what is required for lower variance .
Which is better ?
The big problem with strong employment protection is that it tends to create an insider class of well - protected permanent employees and an outsider class who are either unemployed or assigned to some form of semi-permanent “ temporary ” status ( see , for example , the tenure system in universities ) .
But , comparing the EU and US as a whole , the opposite seems to be the case – there is a sharper class divide , and less social mobility in the US than in the EU .
More on this from the Center for Economic Policy Research ( h/t Brad DeLong ) .
* In response to various comments , this is harmonised data adjusted to remove the effects of differences in national definitions .
The choice of definition still makes a difference – for example , the harmonised definition refers to the civilian non-institutional population .
If prisoners were treated as unemployed , this would raise the US rate by about 1.5 percentage points and the EU rate by about 0.2 percentage points .
Students disciplined for praying can sue PRAYER
Two students who were threatened with suspension at the College of Alameda after one of them prayed with an ailing teacher in a faculty office can sue the community college district for allegedly violating their freedom of speech , a federal judge has ruled .
The students , Kandy Kyriacou and Ojoma Omaga , said college officials at first told them they were being suspended for " disruptive behavior , " then held disciplinary hearings and sent them letters warning that they would be punished if they prayed in a teacher 's office again .
The women sued , and U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled in San Francisco that their case could proceed , saying a college student has the right to pray in private outside the classroom .
Although a public college , like other government agencies , must refrain from endorsing religion , Illston said in her March 31 ruling that an objective observer probably would n't have thought that the Alameda community college was making any such endorsement just because the teacher bowed her head while the student was praying .
The case dates from the fall of 2007 , when Kyriacou and Omaga were studying fashion design and merchandising at the two - year college and took breaks from class to pray with each other and other students on a balcony , according to their suit .
Kyriacou prayed with the teacher , Sharon Bell , at an office Bell shared with other teachers , on two occasions in November and December 2007 .
The second time , a day when Bell was feeling ill , another teacher entered the office and told Kyriacou , " You ca n't be doing that in here , " and the student stopped praying and left , the suit said .
Kyriacou and Omaga received suspension notices 10 days later .
Omaga was accused of praying disruptively in class , Illston said , citing testimony at the students ' disciplinary hearings .
The students ' suit seeks an acknowledgment of their rights , an apology and removal of all disciplinary action , but no damages apart from attorneys ' fees , said Steven Wood , one of the lawyers .
In seeking dismissal of the suit , lawyers for the Peralta Community College District argued that the school was entitled to designate faculty offices as " places for teaching and learning and working , " and not for " protests , demonstrations , prayer or other activities " that would be disruptive .
The students countered that they were being punished for the content of their speech , not its disruptiveness .
Illston said the students could try to prove that the school treated religious expression more harshly than other speech .
Brad Dacus , president of the Pacific Justice Institute , which is representing the students , said , " It is alarming that a publicly funded college would seek to suspend and expel students for praying on campus , then dig in its heels to defend an untenable , unconstitutional position . "
Jeff Heyman , a spokesman for the college district , said its leaders " respect freedom of speech and the First Amendment , " but would not comment on a pending case .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday declared a “ state of emergency ” for the state over an outbreak of the swine flu that has killed 149 people in Mexico .
So far state and local officials have confirmed 13 cases of the swine flu in California .
None has been fatal , although Los Angeles County Coroner ’s officials were investigating two deaths as possibly related to the disease .
Schwarzenegger ’s proclamation allows the state to deploy additional resources to the Department of Public Health and more quickly and easily purchase equipment and materials .
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano declared a federal public health emergency on Sunday .

Advertisement A skydiver from Staffordshire has survived a 6,000 ft free fall in Russia .
James Boole , from Tamworth , said he was supposed to have been given a signal by another skydiver to open his parachute , but it came two seconds too late .
Mr Boole , who was filming the other skydiver for a television documentary , landed on snow - covered rocks and suffered a broken back and rib .
" I really thought that I was going to die - an incredible feeling of sadness and just how unfair that was , " he said .
" What went through my mind was my wife and my daughter . "
Mr Boole said he could not make sense of his survival Mr Boole , who has made 2,500 jumps , is now back at home in a body brace .
He said : " ( The other flyer ) took us so close to the ground where I thought I was dead .
" When I finally looked at the ground and realised how low I was , I knew there was no time for me to get a full parachute above my head .
" For the first 48 hours after the accident I thought maybe I am dead and this is some kind of after - life limbo , or some other reality , because I could n't make sense of it - how I was still here to come through this ? "
His wife , Kristina , who is also a skydiver , said : " For the moment I 'm thinking just of him to recover , so not about jumping or anything like that .
" But yeah ( I ) would like him to stop doing that . "

Former President George W. Bush announced in Calgary yesterday that he is planning to write a memoir “ so when the history of this administration is written at least there ’s an authoritarian voice saying exactly what happened . ”
Bush did not reveal if John
Yoo would be the co-author .
Bush spoke to an “ invited audience of Calgary businessmen , ” according to a report in the Examiner .
The paper noted that “ Bush was full of jokes throughout his speech . ”
Since it was an “ invited audience , ” there were no awkward questions about torture or whether Bush expects to be indicted as a war criminal .

Sir David Attenborough has revealed that some viewers send him hate mail for not crediting God in his nature documentaries .
Speaking about his recent work on Charles Darwin and natural selection , the presenter told the Radio Times : " They tell me to burn in hell and good riddance . "
Sir David explained that he is often asked why he does not credit the Lord , saying : " They always mean beautiful things like hummingbirds .
I always reply by saying that I think of a little child in East Africa with a worm burrowing through his eyeball .
The worm cannot live in any other way , except by burrowing through eyeballs .
" I find that hard to reconcile with the notion of a divine and benevolent creator . "
The naturalist was recently credited for encouraging a group of Golden - eyed Treefrogs to mate during a visit to the ZSL London Zoo .
The frogs had endured a three - year dry spell until Sir David 's presence encouraged them to do the deed .

There is only one place I know that combines tiny balls , plastic cups and vats of beer .
Besides Jose Canseco's house , that is .
It 's a beer pong tournament .
This is a sport that requires a steady hand , faulty hearing and a titanium liver .
It 's believed that 73 % of all tuition money goes toward it .
Beer pong is played on a table slightly smaller than Ping - Pong 's , by teams of two .
Ten cups , filled about one - third with beer , are set like bowling pins at the ends .
As you try to toss or bounce a Ping - Pong ball into the cups on the side opposite yours , opponents jump and yell unspeakables about your mother .
If you make it , they must drink it .
First team to sink all 10 cups wins .
It 's very sophisticated .
But the beer pong I play is nothing like the kind in the World Series of Beer Pong , which I covered recently at the Flamingo Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas .
That 's where North America 's 414 best pong teams competed for the $ 50,000 first prize .
Second prize : bubkes .
Gulp .
You have never seen such large people throw such tiny objects into such small receptacles with such hair - raising frequency .
The best teams hit about 70 % of their shots on the eight - foot tables .
That 's like pitching a quarter into a parking meter slot seven times out of 10 .
More shocking was that it was more about pong than booze .
Four of the 10 cups were filled with water , which worked out to one beer per player per hour .
Regular pongers pour more than that on their Raisin Bran .
In fact , drinking was optional .
One team used only water in the first round —
Mrs. and Mrs. Lara and Kristin Mendez of New York City .
That 's right , two married women .
Beer Pong : changing the world .
Still , there were quality team names , such as : He Sucks … I 'm Good ; Beer Pong … Because Jesus Would ; and Chase 's Mom ATM .
There was also Francois the Butt Dusters , made up of my sons , Jake ( 21 ) and Kel ( 23 ) .
The Dusters started off 4 –0 , including a W over a team from Rochester , whose members , no joke , would , out of nowhere , slap each other hard on the face .
The slapee , red-cheeked , would look at his partner — stunned — and then yell , " Yeeeeahhh ! ! ! "
One guy from Jersey ripped his shirt off just before a crucial point .
One team played sitting on each other 's shoulders .
The real drama centered on Albany 's the Iron Wizard Coalition .
These guys made last year 's finals and sank their final cup while their opponents , Chauffeuring the Fat Kid , still needed four .
They went triple Gramatica , jumping and dancing and hugging .
" I had that money spent , " says Mike Hulse , 28 , of the Wizards .
But they forgot about beer pong 's diabolical redemption rule , which allows a last chance as long as you do n't miss another cup .
Fat Kid never did .
Four straight sinks .
Pong history .
Kid wound up winning the game and the cash .
" Do I think about it ? " says Hulse , who does n't make much working for a cable company .
" I think about it every time I look at a bill .
Every freakin ' time . "
Alas , the Wizards wound up 49th this year .
The Butt Dusters finished a valiant 182nd .
The finals came down to the tourney faves : Smashing Time ( Ron Hamilton and Michael " Pops " Popielarski , both 25 ) vs. Getcha Popcorn Ready ( Brian Nentwig and Joe Radesco , both 23 ) .
The 6 ' 4 " , 280 - pound Hamilton chugged a bottle of Jack Daniel 's beforehand .
" The key today , " he said later , " was me getting real drunk . "
( Maybe it was n't always more about pong than booze . )
Popcorn , winner of the loser 's bracket , needed to win both games to be crowned King Pong .
Smashing Time had to win only one .
Popcorn won Game 1 .
The next would be for everything .
And that 's when I saw something I 've never seen in sports .
The two teams had made a secret deal before the match :
If Popcorn won Game 1 and the tourney continued , the winners would give the losers $ 3,000 .
Can you imagine ?
" Tell you what , " Kobe says to KG before Game 7 .
" Winner buys the loser a Rolls . Deal ? "
Bad move for Smashing Time , which then proceeded to sink little white balls just like in Tiger 's dreams .
They used only 12 shots to make their final 10 and win easily .
Twelve balls , 10 cups .
Try that at home .
It should be noted that the final was filled with honor .
Nobody mentioned anybody 's sister or flashed unwelcome appendages .
That 's good .
All this bush league stuff will have to go if we 're going to take beer pong to the next level : the Olympics .
Hope they do n't test for whiskey .
Love the column , hate the column , got a better idea ?

Online video site Hulu trumpeted its ascension to the media big time a few months back with a dash of sardonic humor .
In its debut TV commercial , in which Alec Baldwin mocks the audience ’s addiction to the very shows he creates as a fictional network executive , the site calls itself “ an evil plot to destroy the world . ”
The joke is uneasily close to the truth for some in the television business .
Once dismissed as “ Clown Co. ” by Silicon Valley critics who scoffed at the notion that old media giants could ever harness the Internet , the website with a name that sounds like a Hawaiian dance has quickly upset the status quo .
Hulu ’s traction with users has entrenched entertainment companies worried that the video site ’s runaway success could undercut the financial underpinnings of the industry .
Those companies are fighting back , and the result could mean no more free passes for many signature cable programs that appear on Hulu .

NBC Universal and News Corp. publicly launched Hulu a little more than a year ago as a gamble on television ’s digital future .
The website allows viewers to watch thousands of episodes of TV shows for free , from current hits like “ Family Guy ” and “ The Office ” to old favorites like “ WKRP in Cincinnati ” and “ I Dream of Jeannie . ”
Hulu ’s simple design , expansive catalog and no cover charge have elevated it to one of the most popular websites for watching video .
With 42 million viewers in March -- an audience nearly twice the size of TV ’s most popular show , Fox ’s “ American Idol ” --
Hulu whizzed past Yahoo and Microsoft ’s MSN , and is now nipping at the heels of Google ’s YouTube .
“ Hulu has certainly exceeded all of our expectations , ” said Jean - Briac Perrette , NBC Universal ’s president of digital distribution .
“ We ’ve come a long way from Clown Co . ”
Late last month , Walt Disney Co. overcame its initial skepticism and signed on as an equity owner of Hulu , which has nearly 150 content partners .
That gives the video site even more star power with the addition of ABC ’s “ Desperate Housewives ” and “ Lost , ” and cable hits such as ABC Family ’s “ The Secret Life of the American Teenager ” and Disney Channel ’s “ Wizards of Waverly Place . ”

“ Our feeling is that -- and some of this is instinct , by the way -- media consumption online is growing and will continue to grow , ” Disney Chief Executive Robert A .
Iger said in a call last week with analysts who grilled him about Hulu .
“ It is really important for us to establish ourselves there . ”
But in making a bid for the next generation of Internet - attuned viewers , Hulu ’s owners have strained their lucrative relationships with cable and satellite operators .
Companies like Time Warner Cable Inc. and DirecTV Group Inc. pay cable networks billions of dollars each year to carry programming .
Believing that they should have exclusivity because their payments support the enormous cost of producing TV shows , such companies have been pushing back against the Hulu freebies .
Investors also are wary that the media companies ’ embrace of the Internet - content - should - be - free philosophy threatens one of Hollywood ’s biggest profit centers : cable programming .
“ If you give away your premium content for free , you are basically hastening your own demise , signing your own death warrant , ” said Laura Martin , a media analyst with Soleil - Media Metrics .
“ There is a choice that companies have to make . ”

Hulu illustrates the quandary that media executives face as they weigh the potential of the Internet against their dependable , old - line businesses .
If the television industry does not find a way to preserve its two pillars of revenue -- advertising and subscription fees -- the consequences could be dire .
Analysts point to the rapid deterioration of newspapers , which traded paying print subscribers for the expectation of big bucks from online advertising that have not materialized .
The conflict has forced Hulu to make concessions that have hurt users who have come to expect a rich menu on the video site .
In recent months , entire seasons of “ It ’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia ” were abruptly taken off the site , along with episodes of other cable TV shows such as “ In Plain Sight ” and “ Psych . ”
Hulu even blocked access to a technology that lets its users watch content on their TVs .
The move provoked outrage among fans of the software , called Boxee , drawing 385 angry comments on the company ’s website .
“ Big Media had better come out of their hole and embrace the power of Internet streaming or they ’ll be in big trouble down the road , ” wrote one poster who identified himself as Lew Ciokiewicz .

Hulu ’s pullback in the case of “ Always Sunny , ” one of the site ’s early favorites , underscores the tug of war within established media companies over the wisdom of placing TV shows on the Internet for free .
The quirky sitcom about a group of slackers has become a signature of the FX cable channel .
( FX is a division of Fox , whose parent company , News Corp. , is one of Hulu ’s founding partners . )
Even as FX acknowledged Hulu brought it new viewers , the cable network nonetheless demanded that the video site drop three seasons from its free online offerings over fears it would undercut the show ’s ratings and hamper lucrative DVD sales .
“ We are not going to take steps that ignore the needs of our partners , ” explained Hulu Chief Executive Jason Kilar .

In the summer of 2006 , Hulu partners Fox and NBC were thinking primarily of their own needs .
YouTube , the video site that Google Inc. would later buy for $ 1.65 billion , was beginning to look like the future of television .
Initially designed as a platform to share homemade videos , it was quickly appropriated by users sharing TV highlights .
That terrified media executives , who feared they were about to lose control of their shows .
They had cause for alarm : Consumers were gravitating toward online video at a faster clip than they had with cellphones , DVDs and even high - speed Internet service .
With the lessons of music piracy and Napster freshly in mind , Hulu was launched in March 2008 as a way of keeping TV programming safely in the hands of its creators and distributors .
And by making it free , it could short - circuit piracy .
It worked .
Perhaps too well .
“ The appetite for full - length TV shows online was larger than anyone thought or expected , ” said Bobby Tulsiani , Forrester Research media analyst .
“ And now people are starting to wonder , do we even need the cable connections ? ”

The country ’s largest cable operators are n’t waiting around to find out the answer .
In recent months , the operators have taken a hard line against cable networks for funneling their shows to Hulu .
Some have gone so far as to stipulate that cable networks limit the number of episodes they make available online .
Others have imposed an outright ban .
The strictures buy time for cable operators until they can develop their own response to Hulu .
That strategy puts cable networks in a corner .
They do n’t want to jeopardize the multimillion - dollar payments they receive from cable and satellite operators , so they are approaching the website cautiously .
For example , Turner Broadcasting System Inc. refuses to give popular shows like TNT ’s “ The Closer ” to Hulu , preferring to keep a handful of episodes on its own site .
“ We have to be mindful of the fact that we have a good business that works for all the players , ” said Andrew Heller , domestic distribution president for Turner Broadcasting .
“ We have to find ways to advance the business rather than cannibalize it . ”
Even the cable channels owned by Fox and NBC have been stingy about what they provide on Hulu .
Just five episodes of cable shows like “ Psych ” on NBC Universal ’s USA Network or “ Dog Whisperer ” on Fox ’s National Geographic channel appear on the site -- usually a week after their initial television run .

Fox and NBC say there is little evidence that people are canceling their cable subscriptions because of Hulu .
They contend that making shows available online provides valuable publicity , which stokes viewership on TV .
Nonetheless , the two media companies are discussing ways to adapt Hulu to preserve their relationships with cable operators , whose carriage fees help underwrite the cable networks ’ programming .
Operators have another incentive to come to the table :
They want to keep customers signed up for their high - speed Internet service , which people need to watch shows online .
NBC Universal and News Corp. are considering whether to adopt a cable industry initiative called authentication , which would require users to prove they are pay TV subscribers before they can watch current shows on Hulu .
The partners also are discussing setting up a tiered system for online video , with some shows available for free -- such as prime - time network offerings -- while others would be reserved for existing cable TV subscribers .
Advertisement
“ Everyone is coalescing around a central area -- authentication , ” said Tony Vinciquerra , chief of Fox ’s television networks .
“ If we can move this in the right direction , it will be something relatively seamless to the consumer , and good for business overall . ”

I admit that when I read a news report titled “ NGOs , Teesta spiced up Gujarat riot incidents : SIT ” in Times of India , I almost bought it .
I know it is stupid to blindly believe everything that the media churns out , but the story was published in TOI and they quoted the SIT in their news report which added to some primary credibility .
Then there were immediate responses from Sangh Parivar sympathizers .
They said that the “ pseudo - secular media ” conveniently withheld the story from publishing since it is election time .
They attacked their enemies , those who stand for the secular ethos of the country .
They also wanted the Supreme Court to initiate action on the “ pseudo secular media ” because of their silence on the issue .
I was shocked to read the whole thing .
I got confused too , as whom to believe and whom not to believe on such sensitive issues .
I thought that the very same secular values that many people in this great country stood for have just got dirty because of people like Teesta .
Like I said before , I almost bought it .
Yet , the main charges / claims of the Times of India reporter had no substance and it did not come from the SIT .
The major claims in the Times of India report mentioned the following :
The riot witnesses were tutored by Teesta Setalvad before submitting the affidavits
The celebrated rights activist [ referring to Teesta ] cooked up macabre tales of wanton killings
The gangrape on Kausar Banu , and the gouging out of her foetus by the mob was found with “ no truth ”
Dumping of dead bodies into a well by rioters at Naroda Patiya was also found with “ no truth ”
The TOI report said that all of these were told by SIT chief R K Raghavan in the Supreme Court on April 13th , Monday .
But hold your horses , because none from the SIT or Mr. Raghavan himself were present in the apex court on April 13 to tell anything .
Even though the TOI article was referring to the SIT report , the person whom they quoted was Gujarat government ’s counsel , Mukul Rohtagi .
And the SIT chief Mr. Raghavan told Hindutan
Times that the alleged leaks appear to have been based on statements of state police officials and “ cannot be termed as findings of the report . ” [ via ]
Then came the second article in Times of India , by the same reporter and this time the reporter said nothing about the above claims and rather held on to “ discrepancies ” and “ contradictions “ .
No word about Kausar Banu , Wanton Killing or the Tutoring of Teesta .
He chose to be silent on those allegations which he had earlier stated as the “ SIT found untrue “ .
So yes , if this is the kind of journalism we are fed with , there needs to have legal action against “ such ” media houses .
Unfortunately , these are the times of India .
PS : It does n’t take a genius to guess why the Gujarat counsel ’s claims made news just 3 days before the 1st phase of general elections .
I am not for or against Teesta ’s case .
We have a process of law in place and our Supreme Court to judge the case .
So let the law take it ’s due course .

Completely and totally mind - blowingly awesome .
Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a machine that allows a pig ’s heart to beat WITHOUT THE BODY .
Yes , heart transplants are cool .

The mindset of a sub is vitally important when employing the technique of erotic humiliation .
As mentioned in my book Erotic Humiliation , many suffer from psychological issues stemming from childhood .
Abuse is a commonplace which too many fail to deal with .
They are victims who never were able to get past those situations .
Getting involved in BDSM does not mean that we become psychologists .
Nevertheless , it is important to understand how past abuses affect self esteem , self worth , and can impact all the decisions that one makes .
Traveling down this road with one who lacks the mental makeup to enjoy it can have adverse affects .
The damage caused can be irreversible .
Erotic humiliation is a technique that is designed to enhance a scene .
Like much in the BDSM world , it walks the fine line of play and reality .
The degradation of a sub is done within the confines of a controlled environment .
This is what deparates it from everyday life .
The parameters established allow him / her to enjoy the scene while not having the esteem affected .
I ran across a few who will take what a Dom says seriously .
This is part of the process through the power exchange .
However , a sub needs to be able to separate the scene from other aspects of her life .
For example , just because a Dom tells her how worthless she is during the scene , that does not mean it is true in all areas of her life .
Nobody is totally worthless .
She might be a wonderful mother , successful executive , or tremendous citizen .
Nevertheless , during the scene , the Dom might want to enphasize her worthlessness .
The fact that it is not true will often allow the sub to have a heightened sexual experience .
BDSM contains a lot of fantasy .
We often engage in activities that fulfill people 's fantasies .
This is one of the highlights of BDSM .
Individuals can do things that they would not ordinarily do .
Being degraded is something those with submissive streaks often dream about .
Making this part of the play scene is a good way to fulfill this desire .
Yet , there are those who can handle it and those who cannot .
Be wary when touching upon this subject .

Substance abuse or misuse is ‘ the continual misuse of any mind altering substance which severely interferes with an individual ’s physical and mental health , social situation and responsibilities ’ .
Alcohol dependence is the most common problem of this kind , but the misuse of any drug , including heroin , cocaine , crack and cannabis , comes into this category , as does the misuse of volatile substances such as glue and aerosols .
Substance abuse may also include smoking cigarettes or drinking excessive amounts of coffee .
Although not strictly a form of substance abuse , the eating disorder bulimia nervosa does involve the misuse of food .
Most forms of substance abuse may give you a temporary feeling of well being or of being in control but all of them can ultimately damage your health .
The most severe forms of substance misuse are normally treated by specialist drug and alcohol rehabilitation services .
For people with mental health problems who are also substance misusers , the mental health team normally encourages contact with a specialist substance misuse service for help .
There is also a lot you can do to help yourself .
What leads to substance abuse ?
There are many reasons why you may start to use and then go on to misuse any of these substances .
You may begin because of curiosity , a sense of rebellion or influence from your peers .
You may find the experience enjoyable and want to repeat it .
It may start when you are unhappy or stressed or trying to cope with problems in your life .
Drugs , alcohol , nicotine , solvents and even food can start as ‘ props ’ to help you get through difficult times .
But the feelings of relief are only temporary , and as the problems do n’t disappear , you may use more and more of these substances and risk becoming dependent on them – which in itself creates new problems .

Coffee , tea and chocolate all contain caffeine .
It is also added to some soft drinks and energy drinks as well as being an ingredient in some painkillers and cold remedies .
The amount of caffeine in different products depends on the product and on how they ’re prepared .
The average cup of coffee contains around 40 mg per cup , a can of cola around 23 mg , whereas some energy drinks have four times that amount .
Plain chocolate has 40 - mg caffeine per 100g – nearly three times as much as milk chocolate .
Dependent on caffeine
Caffeine stimulates the brain and nervous system .
It can make you feel more alert and better able to concentrate , and it also increases acid production in the stomach , which helps digestion .
If you regularly have large quantities of caffeine – say , five or more cups of coffee a day – you may find your tolerance has increased and you need to drink even more to get the same stimulant effect .
The disadvantages of caffeine are that it raises your heart rate and blood pressure and makes you pass more urine – so you may end up losing calcium if you have too much .
Sensitivity to caffeine varies from person to person , but too much can make you anxious , restless , irritable , jittery and sleepless .
It can also give you headaches , stomach pain , nausea , muscle twitching or palpitations .
Medicinal drugs , such as tranquillisers and sleeping tablets , are initially prescribed for very good reasons , but they can also cause health problems if used for long periods .
Experts believe tranquillisers only really help anxiety for about a month and that sleeping tablets are only effective for a couple of weeks .
After that time you may find you need a higher dose to get the same effect and even then your anxiety may increase or your sleeplessness return .
Street drugs , such as cannabis or ecstasy , are usually taken for recreational purposes .
How they affect you will depend on the type of drug , the amount you use , your mood and surroundings .
For some people , the first hit can cause problems , especially if the drug contains impurities .
For other people , the problems may start as their bodies get used to the repeated presence of the drug , and they need higher and higher doses to maintain the same effect .
Types of drugs
All drugs can be divided up according to the main effect they have on users .
Stimulants
These include caffeine and tobacco as well as amphetamines , anabolic steroids , ‘ poppers ’ , hallucinogenic amphetamines ( ecstasy ) , cocaine and crack .
They act on the central nervous system and increase brain activity .
Users generally feel more confident and alert , are able to stay awake for longer or perform physical tasks for a long period of time .
With all except tobacco , high doses can cause nervousness and anxiety .
Apart from tobacco and caffeine , stimulants can cause temporary feelings of paranoia .
These include minor tranquillisers such as Valium , Librium , Mogadon and temazepam , solvents , glues , aerosols and gases .
Depressants act on the central nervous system and slow down brain activity .
They relax users , making them feel less tense and anxious , but at the same time impair mental and physical activity and decrease self - control .
Analgesics
Analgesics are painkillers and include heroin , opium , pethidine and codeine .
They make users less sensitive to emotion and physical pain and produce feelings of warmth and contentment .
Hallucinogens
These include cannabis , LSD and ‘ magic ’ mushrooms .
Hallucinogens act on the mind , heightening sensations and distorting the way users see and hear things .
Signs you may be becoming dependent on drugs
If you rely on drugs to help you feel less anxious or depressed or to improve your mood , you may be becoming psychologically dependent .
If you rely on drugs to achieve certain physical effects or you can’t face the unpleasant physical effects of not taking the drugs , you may be becoming physically addicted .
In fact most drug - related problems generally involve physical and psychological symptoms and sometimes it is difficult to separate the two .
Other signs that you could be becoming dependent on drugs :
If obtaining and taking drugs are more important than anything else in your life
If you use drugs to block out both physical and emotional pain
If you use drugs to distance yourself from problems such as loneliness , family or relationship problems , low self esteem , poverty or housing difficulties , unemployment or lack of opportunities .

Keep in mind that the very same politicians who are supporting this sort of thing are also telling us , in very grave tones , how worried they are about the deficit and why it 's impossible to do things like provide universal health care or more money for education .
One could reasonably retort that it 's simply a matter of different priorities .
Just remember :
Although we elect the legislators , it 's the corporate lobbyists who keep those high - priced perks coming !
May 22 ( Bloomberg ) --
Banks negotiating to reclaim stock warrants they granted in return for Troubled Asset Relief Program money may shortchange taxpayers by almost $ 10 billion if Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s first sale sets the pace , data compiled by Bloomberg show .
While 17 financial institutions have repaid TARP funds , two have come to terms with the U.S. on the value of the rights to buy stock that taxpayers received for the risk of recapitalizing the industry .
The first was Old National Bancorp in Evansville , Indiana , which gave the Treasury Department $ 1.2 million last week for warrants that may have been worth $ 5.81 million , according to the data .
If Geithner makes the same deal for all companies in the rescue program , lenders may walk away with 80 percent of the profits taxpayers might have claimed .
“ For once we ’d like to get a fair value when we come into contact with the banking system , ” said Representative Brad Miller , a North Carolina Democrat and chairman of the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of House Science and Technology Committee .
“ We do n’t want a ruthless bargain . ”
From the ' forking open source ' files :
Nagios is critical open source application providing monitoring capabilities that are widely used ( by millions ? ) by many including myself .
Yet apparently the pace of Nagios evolution was n't fast enough or inclusive enough for all , so a group of contributors is now forking Nagios and making their own Nagios - based open source systems monitoring solution called ' icinga . '
According to icinga's website , their goal is to , " be more responsive to user
requests and faster in software development through the support of a
broader developer community . "
Initially ( at least ) , icinga is set to be compatible with Nagios , which is how forks typically start out .
Over time though it is rare in my experience that forks remain compatable .
Take Nessus for example ( no longer open source but it was ) , it 's open source fork OpenVAS is no longer compatible with the leading edge of Nessus development .
That 's a bit of a different case though as Tenable ( the commerical sponsor of Nessus ) claimed back in 2005 that the open source development model was n't working for Nessus .
With Nagios , the claim is a little different .
The claim is that there are governance and development issues that current organization structure of the Nagios project are not addressing , so the Icinga people are the option of forking and starting their own project .
Icinga claims that its members have attempted to clear the development bottleneck but have been unsuccessful .
" Long awaited improvements
such as the regular integration of community patches , the connection to
databases or the web interface were hoped to be accelerated , " Icinga claims .
" Unfortunately , these attempts came to little success and effective
community commitment has gradually deflated . "
So who is Icinga ?

Legislation which would force public bodies to prevent class discrimination has been published for the first time in British history .
The single equality bill was presented to the public today , before being debated and voted on in the Commons .
" The recession has put a focus not just on people 's fears for today but on their hopes for tomorrow , " women 's minister Harriet Harman said .
" That hope is for a fair and equal society which is stable and prosperous . "
It brings together all the UK 's equality legislation , with several new pieces of law which have divided commentators and set down the groundwork for battles to come .
Public bodies will have an obligation to reduce inequality , for instance by encouraging parents from poor backgrounds to apply to successful local schools .
Private companies will also feel the effects of the bill , with firms being forced to provide audits of their pay to staff , so gender gaps can be spotted .
Companies which consistently pay their male colleagues more will be named and shamed .
Firms with more than 250 employees will have until 2013 to reveal the salaries .
The scheme also applies to public - sector bodies with 150 employees or more , including Whitehall departments , local councils , strategic health authorities , regional development agencies and the Met - as well as ministers .
Shadow women 's minister Theresa May said the plan would make no difference to the gender pay gap .
" We 're concerned that too many of the proposals in this bill will be bureaucratic and expensive without providing real results , " she said .
" For example , Labour 's proposal for compulsory pay audits for all companies , rather than those proven to have broken the law , will simply waste time and money without making any difference to pay discrimination . "
The business sector is already smarting from the proposal .
David Frost , director general of the British Chambers of Commerce , said : " Last Wednesday the chancellor positioned business at the heart of the economic recovery in the Budget and said all actions were to help reinforce that position .
" Yet within days the government is announcing that businesses are to be burdened with a requirement to carry out gender pay audits in the equalities bill .
Clearly some sections of government just do n't get it , that business is critical to recovery . "
Trade unions responded fiercely , with Brenden Barber , TUC general secretary saying audits were the most effective way to get movement on equal pay .
" The UK will never tackle the problem of unequal pay until there are systems in place exposing the huge gap between what men and women doing similar jobs in the same workplaces are paid , " he said .
" The business lobby will of course complain loudly about what they see as another burden on business , but pay audits are the very least employers should do if we are to finally get rid of low and unequal pay for female workers in the UK . "
There is also an outright ban on age discrimination and a general requirement for public bodies to actively think about the needs of minorities , rather than just react to problems .
This will bring gay rights into the same category as race or disability .
Seemingly innocuous , it will almost certainly provoke political earthquakes later on , with teachers in faith schools likely to rebel over discussing homosexuality in the classroom .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) is ploughing a lonely path through the proposals .
On the one hand , its finding are part of what has prompted action in the first place , with a recent report showing City bonuses for women are 79 per cent lower than for men .
But the Commission is uncomfortable with the audit suggestion , raising concerns that forcing firms to conduct equal pay reviews could provoke a flurry of litigation claims .
Instead , the ECHR wants an amnesty period for employers to tackle the problem internally without resort to the tribunal process .

Funny men have the last laugh ...
Who gets the girl ?
Funny men like David Walliams , seen with model Lauren Budd , are luckier in love
It has long been noted that women love a man who can make them laugh - just look at ' sex thimble ' Dudley Moore or serial dater David Walliams .
And now scientists believe they know why .
Being funny apparently makes men seem more intelligent , trustworthy - and a better bet for a relationship .
Psychologist Kristofor McCarty said : ' A quick browse of lonely hearts ads will confirm that women look for a good sense of humour in a potential partner - our research may explain why this is the case . '
Mr McCarty drew his conclusions after a study where he asked 45 women to rate the personalities behind a selection of ' lonely hearts ' adverts .
Some of these were funny , others were entirely factual .
The men in the humorous adverts were rated as more intelligent - despite the descriptions containing no clues on IQ .
They were also seen as more honest and better material for a relationship or a friendship , the British Psychological Society 's annual conference heard .
Mr McCarty , of Northumbria University , said : ' There was a kind of halo effect .
The funny guys appear to be getting everything .
' I think men play on this - I would if I was funny .
' For a man that does n't look like Brad Pitt , it gives them a bit of hope .
' You probably wo n't call somebody like Billy Connolly particularly attractive but he's had a couple of wives and had children .
His selling point is that he is hilarious . '
James Corden , star of the BBC comedy Gavin and Stacey , has said being funny helped him to attract women from his teenage years onwards .
James Corden has said being funny has helped him to attract women from his teenage years onwards
' My weight was never a concern for me , ' he said .
' I could always talk to them and make them laugh , so they tended to overlook my physical imperfections . '
It is thought women equate wit with brains - perceiving funny men as good providers and good father material .
Mr McCarty said : ' From an evolutionary point of view the reason a woman wants to look for a humorous guy is because it is a sign of intelligence and intelligence gives a man the ability to provide resources for their children and survive rather than falling down a trap and dying .
' And having a funny guy around the house rather than some drab businessman is much more fun . '
But Mr McCarty cautioned : ' Guys be warned : not just any gag will do .
' We discovered that humour must be genuinely funny for the man to be judged as more intelligent . '
Men , however , do not place so much value on a woman 's wit .
When a man says he would like a woman with a good sense of humour , he really means one that will laugh at his jokes , said Mr McCarty .
All right , it ’s missing an engine , but the legendary British fighter could make you a garden feature .
The Harrier GR7 ( ZD462 ) is being offered to the highest bidder after spending its twilight years as a training plane for mechanics at RAF Cosford , near Telford , Shropshire .
The two - seater will have trouble fitting into most garages .
It is 46ft long and has a wingspan of 26ft .
A new GR7 would cost millions , but used , engineless , Harriers have fetched just over £ 60,000 .
The British - invented Harriers became famous in the 1982 Falklands War .
This particular jet ’s history is not so illustrious .
It came to RAF Cosford after crashing into the sea in 1996 .
The pilot safely ejected .
It is being sold by the Disposal Services Authority , which sells items for the armed forces .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama came under strong criticism from Republicans on Wednesday for leaving the door open to the prosecution of former Bush officials who authorized severe interrogations by the CIA .

Obama ’s decision to release classified memos last Thursday that detailed aggressive techniques used on terrorism suspects , including waterboarding , sleep deprivation and forced nudity , has triggered a political firestorm in Washington .
Politicians on the left are eager to launch investigations into the Bush - era policies that were part of the effort to prevent a repeat of the September 11 attacks in 2001 .
Those on the right say Obama , a Democrat who took over as president from Republican George W. Bush on January 20 , seems to be breaking a pledge to look forward , not review the past .
Karl Rove , who was a top aide to Bush , accused Obama of seeking to conduct “ show trials ” a day after the president left open the possibility of prosecuting officials who provided legal analysis of interrogation procedures .
“ If the Obama administration insists on criminalizing policy disagreements , how can they place any limits on who they prosecute ? ” Rove told Reuters .
“ Everyone in the interrogation process would have to be treated the same , ” he said , including the CIA agents , the physicians who monitored interrogation sessions and the lawyers who researched and wrote the memos .
The chain could reach “ to the leadership of the intelligence community to the legislators in both parties and the Bush administration officials who were briefed on these memos and agreed to them , ” Rove said .
“ It is now clear that the Obama White House did n’t think before it tried to appease the hard left of the Democratic Party . ”
Critics of the harsh interrogations , including the waterboarding technique that makes suspects feel as if they are drowning , say they amounted to torture .
“ NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW ”
Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department will follow the law wherever it leads in probing U.S. officials behind CIA interrogation policies .
“ No one is above the law , ” he said , reiterating that the department had no intention of prosecuting CIA interrogators who acted “ in good faith ” to follow official legal guidance .
The controversy threatened to become a distraction for Obama as he seeks to keep Americans ’ attention on his efforts to rebuild the U.S. economy .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Obama believes the memos and their release should be a moment for reflection , not a moment for retribution .
Any decision to prosecute anyone , he said , would be made by the Justice Department , not the president or the White House .
“ I think that the lawyers that are involved are plenty capable of determining whether any law has been broken , ” Gibbs said .
Three key U.S. senators , Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham and Democrat - turned - independent Joe Lieberman , issued a joint letter to Obama strongly urging him not to prosecute government officials who provided legal advice related to detainee interrogations .
“ Pursuing such prosecutions would , we believe , have serious negative effects on the candor with which officials in any administration provide their best advice , ” wrote the senators , all of whom had opposed the harsh interrogation tactics .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Democrat , renewed his call for the creation of a special commission to investigate the severe interrogation methods .
Leahy said if the votes cannot be mustered among lawmakers to create such a bipartisan commission , he would hold an investigative hearing and would expect other congressional committees to do so as well .
“ I want someone to tell us exactly what happened so that it wo n’t happen again , ” Leahy told reporters .
The speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , backed Leahy ’s call for “ a truth commission ” but said it should be very selective in granting immunity .
A commission would remove “ all doubt that how we protect the American people is in a values - based way , ” she told a media roundtable hosted by the Christian Science Monitor newspaper .
A liberal group , Moveon.org , asked readers on its website to sign a petition calling on the Obama administration to appoint a special prosecutor “ to investigate and prosecute the architects of the Bush - era torture program . ”
Condoleezza Rice , Bush ’s national security adviser , approved the CIA ’s interrogation program , including waterboarding , in 2002 and Vice President Dick Cheney affirmed White House support a year later , a Senate Intelligence Committee report said on Wednesday .
A former Bush White House press secretary , Ari Fleischer , said if a probe is started , “ Barack Obama will regret this as one of the worst moments of his presidency , because it will set off a multi-year , extraordinarily divisive , all - consuming Washington scandal / controversy and everyone will end up looking bad . ”
No Country For Old Newt
" If the Republicans can't break out of being the right wing party of big government , then I think you would see a third party movement in 2012 , " Newt Gingrich said during a Wednesday speech in Missouri .
Speaking on Fox News Sunday , the former Speaker of the House expanded on why conservatives might turn away from the Republican Party .
" Republicans need to understand that there 's a country which did not like the big spending of the last administration , did n't like the interventionist policies of the last administration and the country at large would like to see a genuine alternative to the Obama strategy of basically trying to run the entire economy from the white house and basically trying to increase government , I think , by 36 % this year , which is the largest single increase outside of war in American history , " said Gingrich .
Oh please .
Sure , there 's a " country " out there that did n't like any of Bush 's policies and it's called " America . "
Contrary to his other assertion , they are n't upset about Obama running the economy from the White House because that 's a load of bs that only addled dittoheads actually think is happening .
And if there is a country of people who hate both Bush 's and Obama 's policies , they are pretty likely to be lefties who have a whole set of concerns that have absolutely nothing to do with concerns about too much intrusion into the private sector .
There have been double - digit decreases in Bush approval ratings among pure independents ( those who are independent and do not " lean " toward either party ) and moderate and liberal Republicans .
Pure independents ' support has fallen from 42 % to 28 % , while moderate and liberal Republicans ' support has dropped from 83 % to 69 % .
Conservative Republicans remain overwhelmingly likely to approve of Bush , but his support among this group has fallen below 90 % in the past 11 months .
Here 's where he ended up in November of 2008 :
Views of President Bush ’s popularity are highly partisan .
Only 6 % of Democrats approve [ and 18 % of Independents ] of the job he has done as president , while 57 % of Republicans approve .

NASA announced via Twitter that the space agency will announce the name of the new International Space Staton module next week on the Comedy Central show , “ The Colbert Report . ”
As you may recall , the show ’s host Stephen Colbert encouraged his viewers to write - in his name in NASA ’s “ Name the Node ” contest , and he won in a landslide over NASA ’s top suggestion , Serenity ( “ that ’s the name of an adult diaper , ” said Colbert ) , by over 40,000 votes .
NASA astronaut Suni Williams will appear on the show on Tuesday , April 14 at 11:30 pm EDT .
This certainly bodes well for the Colbert Nation , but will NASA really come through on this one and do something fun and engaging , or do what the middle - aged space agency usually does .
Will it be “ Democracy in Orbit ? ”
Watch a video of Colbert below telling NASA , “ the ball is in your court . ”
Update — NASA just released a press release on this , and here ’s more :
“ The node naming poll was organic and took on a life of its own , ” said Bill Gerstenmaier , associate administrator for Space Operations at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
“ We received more than a million
entries , in large part because social media Web sites and television programs , such as ‘ The Colbert Report , ’ took an interest .
This spread overall awareness of the International Space Station . ”
NASA originally planned to announce the node ’s name on April 28 after it arrived at NASA ’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
However , the node ’s arrival at Kennedy is delayed until May , so the announcement moved to April 14 .
The show ’s producers offered to host the name selection announcement after comedian and host Stephen Colbert took interest during the census and urged his followers to post the name “ Colbert . ”
“ I certainly hope NASA does the right thing , ” said Colbert .
“ Just kidding , I hope they name it after me . ”
Node 3 is a pressurized module that will provide room for many of the space station ’s life support systems .
Attached to the node is the cupola , a one - of - a - kind work station with six windows around the sides and one on top .
Node 3 is targeted for launch in late 2009 .
For more information about the station and Node 3 .

Back in December , the Wall Street Journal had a good chuckle over Russian academic Igor Panarin ’s prediction that the United States would break apart by 2010 .
Using threadbare Cold War logic , Andrew Osborn wrote that Panarin ’s forecast “ is music to the ears of the Kremlin , which in recent years has blamed Washington for everything from instability in the Middle East to the global financial crisis . ”
For the WSL scribe , Panarin ’s analysis is about the Red Bear “ returning to its rightful place on the world stage after the weakness of the 1990s , when many feared that the country would go economically and politically bankrupt and break into separate territories . ”
The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were nullified many years ago , at least since the emergence of the Federalists under Alexander Hamilton .
In fact , it was not so much “ weakness ” that destroyed Russia as it was the IMF , the World Bank , and Wall Street , in other words it was another bankster looting and fire sale scheme that brought the former Soviet Union down , not that we should expect the Wall Street Journal to admit as much .
Ditto the current “ global financial crisis ” and instability in the Middle East .
“ Mr. Panarin posits , in brief , that mass immigration , economic decline , and moral degradation will trigger a civil war next fall and the collapse of the dollar , ” Osborn summarizes .
“ Around the end of June 2010 , or early July , he says , the U.S. will break into six pieces — with Alaska reverting to Russian control . ”
In the case of a growing number of U.S. states , however , it is not so much economic decline and moral degradation pointing the way to a “ disintegration , ” but rather violations of the Tenth Amendment .
The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution , which is part of the Bill of Rights , was ratified on December 15 , 1791 , and states restates the Constitution ’s principle of Federalism by providing that powers not granted to the national government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states and to the people .
It is based on an earlier provision of the Articles of Confederation : “ Each state retains its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and right , which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States , in Congress assembled . ”
Although Fox News and CNN are not telling you about it , a growing number of states are declaring sovereignty .
Washington , New Hampshire , Arizona , Montana , Michigan , Missouri , Oklahoma , California , and Georgia have all introduced bills and resolutions declaring sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment .
Colorado , Hawaii , Pennsylvania , Arkansas , Idaho , Indiana , Alaska , Kansas , Alabama , Nevada , Maine , and Illinois are considering such measures .
For details on the particular bills and resolutions introduced by the above states , check out the following :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Sadly , far too many Americans are woefully ignorant when it comes to understanding their rights and the Constitution .
As Gary Alder notes in his “ 15 Key Principles of the Founding Fathers , ” the “ 9th and 10th Amendments are the keystones to preserving Freedom . ”
In fact , the first 10 amendments , known as the Bill of ( Individual ) Rights , clarify the restraints placed on the national government and they safeguard the rights of individuals .
It does not take a rocket scientist to conclude that all of these individual rights are under withereing attack by the federal government .
“ Obama ’s plans for a federal handgun license , ‘ hate crimes ’ laws to regulate Christians ’ speech about their own religious beliefs on homosexuality , President Obama ’s youth corps for mandatory public service and the so - called ‘ Fairness Doctrine ’ to ‘ balance ’ talk radio have New Hampshire Lawmakers telling Obama to basically grow up and get some better ideas , ” writes Jake Jones .
“ They say that if Obama ’s plans are implimented , it would constitute a nullification of the Constitution for the United States . ”
Unfortunately , the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were nullified many years ago , at least since the emergence of the Federalists under Alexander Hamilton , as Thomas J. DiLorenzo persausively argues .
“ Federalists like Joseph Story and John Marshall , and later Whig politicians like Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln … would tell The Big Lie that the Constitution was ratified by ‘ the whole people ’ and not as it actually was – by the citizens of the sovereign states , with their representatives assembled in state conventions , ” writes DiLorenzo .
In the years since , the reach and severity of federalism has grown expotentially .
“ The U.S. government is now characterized by dictatorial power , abuse of every kind of personal liberty , confiscatory taxation , economic fascism , dangerous militarism , and imperialism . ”
New World Order minion Obama will take this dictatorial power to new heights under the pretense of saving the people from the bankster engineered global economic depression .
As Obama and Congress further extend the dictatorial reach of the federal government — under the control of a small cotorie of globalists and international bankers — we can expect more states to assert their rights under the Constitution and the Tenth Amendment .

Art of Organizational Refactoring
April 5 , 2009 at 8:08 am
I am doing some thinking about what it takes to implement Scrum in an organization that is not used to or even familiar with agile concepts , let alone Scrum .
When you start a new team or a new company implementing new methodology is rather easy – you select people based on what you believe the required roles and functions are , there is no legacy to overcome and everybody is open to whatever process you are installing .
There is no inertia , there is no resistance and there is no conflicting interests you need to account for .
Of course the exact opposite is true when you are attempting to implement Scrum ( or whatever else ) in an organization with strong waterfall culture .
It ’s not just about telling people about how in Scrum you do so and so , go to this meetings , here is how product backlog should look like – and then you are done .
It is much more challenging because of “ that ’s not how we are used to do things around here ” – so not only you have to be able to teach what Scrum is , but also be able to overcome years of practise of doing something else .
And that is not the hardest part .
It is impossible to make all the changes overnight – this stuff takes a long time to get absorbed and interned and used to .
So there is going to be some time where organization is not going to be very “ organized ” for the lack of better word .
And yet , there are customers and sales and support and contracts that need to be taken care of , and that can not be “ pushed back ” until we can figure out how to do the Scrum stuff properly .
And this brings me to the concept of refactoring .
In software engineering , refactoring is the art of taking an existing piece of software that maybe is using some old technology that is a bit obsolete by now , or maybe it is written in somewhat inefficient way and taking that piece of software and rewriting it in such a way that from the outside it keeps looking exactly the same , performs exactly the same function ( but better ) while inside it gets completely overhauled and made more efficient , with less bugs and easier to maintain .
And I call it an art because yes there are some practices and tricks which help you do that refactoring , but in the end , every software is different and what might have worked on a previous project would n’t work on the next one , so to be able to do this and succeed requires some flexibility and creativity .
And I think similar art form should be developed for implementing Scrum in organizations that are currently stuck in the old ways .
The similar challenges apply – keep the outside interface , support clients , make the sales , while in the same time transforming the entire organization to much more efficient , flexible and adaptive proceses .
And yes , even though some techniques are probable shareable , in the end every organization is different and it will take each one a unique path on its road to agile success .

Artisanal recently held a grilled - cheese - sandwich contest , and though some of the contenders seem to have been lacking ( one judge tweeted : “ Last Meal : The most wretched grilled cheese sandwich ever built by the hand of man ” ) , a winner has been crowned .
Having been deemed worthy by the likes of Terrance Brennan , Eric Ripert , Cesare Casella of Salumeria Rosi , and Rob Kaufelt of Murray ’s Cheese , a taleggio , cherry mostarda , and arugula sandwich created by one Eric Zawacki will now be added to Artisanal ’s menu .
Proceed with caution .
The Winter Olympics in Vancouver brought thousands of people into our region from around the world .
At least two of them arrived with a disease now rare in Canada : measles .
The result was an outbreak of the disease in British Columbia .
There have been twenty - nine cases in total most of whom have not been completely vaccinated .
article continues below
Although a minor outbreak , this event highlights the very real possibility of importing disease .
The need for vaccinations is in some ways greater than has been before because of the ease and frequency of travel around the world : we are going all over the world , and the world is coming to visit , too .
What may have been rare or exotic disease may no longer be so rare , thus the need to be prepared .
Travelling abroad means protection from bugs and viruses our bodies may have never seen .
The best way to prepare is to visit a travel clinic at least four to six weeks prior to departure .
They will advise on the best practices for avoiding disease while travelling , and provide recommended or even required vaccinations for your destination .
Among the more common immunizations that may be needed are malaria , cholera , diphtheria , hepatitis A and B , polio , rabies , typhoid and Japanese encephalitis depending on your destination .
Immunization against yellow fever is a common requirement for entry to some countries .
Without proof a traveller may be denied entry , quarantined or vaccinated .
Saudi Arabia requires proof of meningococcal immunization for all pilgrims to Mecca during the Hajj .
While many diseases can be prevented with vaccination , there are many precautions one can take while abroad .
Anti-malaria drugs work , but it helps to avoid insect bites in the first place using insect repellents and wearing long pants and sleeves .
Water or food - borne disease can be a problem , but again , preventative measures are key .
The simplest rule to remember : " Boil it , cook it , peel it , or leave it ! "
Other precautions include avoiding uncooked foods including shellfish and salads .
Also avoid food from street vendors .
Drink only purified water that 's been boiled or disinfected with chlorine or iodine , or commercially bottled water in sealed containers .
Carbonated drinks and beer are usually safe as well .
Avoid ice unless you know it 's been made from purified water .
In addition to your local travel clinic , other excellent sources of information for travellers include the BC Center for Disease Control ( www.bccdc.ca) and Health Canada 's travel information website ( travel.gc.ca ) .
The BCCDC site provides a good overview plus details about immunization ; Health Canada offers more thorough travel information including travel advisories , immunization requirements and advice on staying healthy while travelling .
Whether travelling to Mexico ( malaria , dengue , botfly , roundworm , West Nile ) , further abroad to Thailand ( malaria , Japanese encephalitis , avian influenza , shistosomiasis , measles , polio ) or anywhere in between , preparation and caution are the keys for coming home as healthy as when you left .

It 's like airplane 's " black box " flight data recorder .
But it 's for data centers .
Israeli startup Axxana has developed an black box recorder to store enterprise data in real - time , so that it 's recoverable in the event of a data center disaster .
When disasters strike data centers , data that has not yet been transmitted to a disaster recovery site is lost .
Axxana 's Phoenix System is a hardened and disaster - proof , 180kg enclosure , built to withstand the equivalent of the extreme conditions in a jet plane crash .
It is hooked up to the storage system at a data center and records a synchronous data stream from that storage , on its own internal solid state drive storage , at the same time as that data is replicated asynchronously to a remote site .
Axxana says the result is rapid post - disaster application recovery , with no data loss whatsoever .
It wo n't however promise 100 per cent data protection .
If a disaster happens , the Phoenix can be recovered and data extracted from it by " physically locating the system by tracking the homing signal and connecting a laptop with an Axxana software component to the Phoenix System at the disaster site " or by the Phoenix system " transferring the data to the secondary site using highly resilient cellular broadband technology . "
It contains a hardened and protected cellular modem , batteries and antennae .
The result is rapid post - disaster application recovery , with Axxana claiming the Phoenix can withstand any disaster short of an atomic explosion and , specifically :
Direct flames at 2000 °F for one hour followed by 450 °F for an additional 6 hours
Pressure of 5000lb
pierce force of a 500 lb rod dropped from 10ft
30 ft of water pressure
A shock of 40G .
Axxana calls its technology Enterprise Data Recording ( EDR ) and says it " eliminates the need for very high bandwidth required for synchronous replication and the need to maintain peak level bandwidth at all times . "
You can download a white paper about it from here ( pdf ) .
The company was founded in 2005 by three people .
One is Dr. Alex Winokur , its Chief Technology Officer , and an IBM master inventor .
He came to Axxana from XIV , acquired by IBM , where he was the CTO , and he was previously a co-founder of deduplication company Sepaton .
The second is Dan Hochberg , Axxana 's EVP for business development and sales , who was previously at Radvision .
Axxana 's CEO and third co-founder is Eli Efrat .
Interestingly , its board of advisors includes the so - called father of the Symmetrix and an XIV founder , Moshe Yanai .
He was also involved with dedupication vendor Diligent and sold it and XIV to IBM .
Another advisor is Fred van den Bosch , the former CTO of Veritas .
Yanai has said this about Axxana 's technology : " It is for the first time that I see a solution that enables a failover site at any distance with the ability to absolutely recover all transactions . "
Axxana has just raised $ 4 m in a second round of funding .
Yanai was involved in this second funding round which took its total funding to $ 10 m .
Axxana has just been recognised by Gartner as a cool vendor in the disaster recovery area .
It is partnering with storage vendors and shipped its first product to an Israeli company in January .
Axxana by the way is a Hebrew word for storage . ®
Feeling a lack of body confidence about your belly ?
Feeling fat and ungoddessy ?
It ’s time to take control , from body magic rituals to creative photography and retraining your well - meaning friends .
These are some body image tips you really wo n’t have seen before …
I ’ve spent a good chunk of my life focused on my belly .
I ’ve looked at it from the front , fully bare in the mirror , and then quickly switched my body to look at it from the side .
And then the front again .
Followed by how it looked in clothing from the front .
And side .
And not in a good way .
I ’d be happy with it the mornings after I refrained from eating late the night before , or when I was doing a cleanse , or had been throwing up the entirety of my insides from a stomach bug ( insanity , no ? ) .
I ’d be terrified of it when I had just consumed a 5 - course meal and was wearing a form - fitting shirt that earlier that day ( pre-breakfast ) had seemed to look sexy .
And then , on the eve of my 30th , I decided I was done .
Absolutely , positively , f*ckin ’ done .
It was time to LUV my stomach , the core of womanly power , hotness appeal , and intuition .
I mean , who decided we should go through life believing we are supposed to hate our amazing , unique , scrumptious bodies because they do n’t look like a 12 - year - old boy’s ?
So whether it is your stomach that makes you feel as if the entire world will call you out for being too fat ( the way they did to Britney on the Video Music Awards – ridiculous ) , or your thighs make you think the hot guy on the other side of the bar is texting his friend about the elephant legs he has just spotted ( who does that ? ? ) , here are 7 ways to accept your gorgeous , goddessy body :
1 . Turn off the telly .
And the internet ( at least the sites that bash women ’s bodies ) .
You know what I ’m talking about .
TMZ .
Hello !
OK !
Yes , they are our guilty pleasures , and there is nothing wrong with that .
But they also fly to remote islands , using super - duper spy lenses to take pictures of famous actresses who have one tiny patch of cellulite on their thighs that their boyfriend does n’t even notice when they are up close and personal .
And then their sister woman ’s magazines , like Allure airbrush the hell out of every picture that touches their pages , literally creating impossible - to - attain bodies .
I mean , c’mon , people , when will this craziness end ?
Well , they are n’t going to end it because they are making too much money doing what they do .
So you have to be the strong one and shut that sh*t off .
Or at least skip over to the stories about the latest celeb to be caught with their pants down .
Now that ’s good stuff .
2 . Take your own pics of your sensuous , smooth , sexy tummy ( or other body part ) .
Never thought I ’d be the type to take nude photos .
But as I approached the big 3 - 0 , I decided I needed to push this belly - acceptance ahead into overdrive .
So I had a good friend ( who is also a good photographer ) take some pics that focused specifically on my stomach .
Trust me , you will have a different perspective of what you look like once you get photos taken of yourself .
No need to necessarily go nude , but be sure to highlight the area of your body that you have qualms with .
This can include dressing it up with bindis or other stick on jewelry , henna , or even some drawn - on hearts as a shout out to your navel , thighs , etc. – wassup , lovelies !
3 . Spend some quality alone time with your lovely lady parts .
This goes beyond vibrations and finger manipulations – it ’s more of a tantric , caressing and crooning appreciation .
Sit in front of a full length mirror , or get a small one you can hold above you while lying on your bed , and get to appreciating .
Thank your stomach for digesting all that you eat with care and precision , and manifesting this nourishment into the sight that you see with , the brain that you do your life ’s work with , and the mojo you have sex with .
Feel the skin with your fingers ( it almost always seems to be softer than you would expect , even if there are bumps , nooks , or crannies ) , and tickle yourself so that you and your belly are laughing together .
Trust me , the laughter will take you far .
4 . Rock it out , belly - dancing style .
No offense to the skinny girls – ya’ll are hot and awesome too – but dancers who have a bit more flesh to move around are so damn sexy , do n’t you agree ?
Especially if they are showing their belly .
If you are n’t quite comfortable tribal bellydancing in public , check out this beginner ’s belly - dancing video .
There are also belly dancing classes all over this whole wide world ; search for a local one here , and get those hips and tummy a - shimmyin’ .
Or , take on a burlesque dance experiment – you ca n’t help but feel sexalicious when dressed up in lingerie and garter belts , shaking your lovely lady lumps , booty , and other bounties .
5 . Connect through rituals , magic , and goddesses .
Whenever I feel myself getting worked into a tizzy about having a fat - day , I immediately go to my goddess tarot cards .
Suddenly , I ’m faced with beautiful drawings of goddesses that got the curves - a - kickin ’ in all the right , womanly , places .
Ahhh , that ’s better .
There are also many wonderful rituals you can do when you feel that spiral pulling you downward and you ’re not entirely sure you can find your way out on your own .
bind / banish negative body image spell
One of my favourites is a bind / banish negative body image spell , where you ’ll need salt , sugar , black or white rope , red or pink candle , and a piece of paper stating “ negative body image ” .
Light the candle , and focus on the piece of paper , reciting :
“ I bind my negative body image ,
I banish it and replace with excessive love .
It ’s a new start ,
There ’s change in my heart .
Im now proud to say my name is______ ”
Put the paper in a container where you can burn it , throw salt at it and set on fire , then repeat the above phrase .
Once the fire is out , throw the sugar on top of the ashes and recite the words one more time before either burying the ashes or letting the wind take them away .
But also feel free to come up with your own ritual that feels good to you , even if it is just giving a shout out to the much maligned body part first thing in the morning or before you go to bed .
And the more often you do it , the bigger impact you ’ll feel .
6 . Refuse the “ I look so fat in this ” conversations .
Lordy , I know this one well .
It was one of my go - to phrases with friends for many , many years while trying on clothes , sitting at cafes , or as pointless references in conversations .
Something that went along with this oh - so - well was the comment from friends or acquaintances , “ You ’ve lost weight !
You look great ! ”
While I appreciated the sentiment , the fact that I looked great after I ’d “ lost ” five pounds ( i.e. my period ended so I was no longer bloated ) is inextricably linked to the fact that I wo n’t look great when those five pounds come back in 3 1/2 weeks ( or before ) .
I decided to tell my friends to no longer mention to me if they noticed that I ’d lost weight , even if they just wanted to tell me I looked fantastic .
I explained kindly that although I knew it was being said out of love for me , and that they were hardly trying to imply I looked like a heiffer previously , my psyche still liked to go on its own rant about it so it would best for all involved that they just smile and nod .
7 . Get your partner , lover , good friend or massage therapist to rub your tummy .
Act like you are Buddha and need your belly rubbed .
Blame it on an upset stomach that only a little abdominal chi nei tsang massage will rectify .
Say that the only way anyone is getting a smile out of you today is to softly tickle your belly button .
I do n’t care how you do it , just get some tummy ( or thigh , arms , backside ) lovin ’ whatever way you can .
What is amazing about each and every one of these approaches is that they will undoubtedly make you feel better about yourself .
There ’s really no way around it .
So why continue to expend any energy whatsoever on NOT revering your totally bangin ’ , incredibly desirous , never - ending pleasure - producing body ?
WHY , I ask ?
That ’s what I thought .
Get it , girl .
Our intrepid journalist shows off her nice tattoo – and tummy .
Hurrah !
These last 3 pics were taken for some low - fat yoghurt ad campaign and were meant to repel you .
Er , what ?
They ’re fantastic !
Especially the ‘ American Beauty ’ riff !
Mookychick gives these photos a 2 thumbs up !

During a downturn , the future can seem daunting for freelance architects .
However , during difficult times the key to excelling is remembering the rules from the good times and ensuring additional prudence .
With regards to winning business , remember that it is easier to sell to existing clients than to prospective clients .
Do n’t forget that your clients are likely to be experiencing the same economic pressures as you at the moment .
Look to use your expertise to ‘ go the extra mile , ’ and provide extra value and potentially services that will benefit the client .
‘ It ’s not what you know but who you know , ’ is a particularly apt phrase at this time .
Keep in contact with all previous hirers and colleagues and do n’t be afraid to ask for referrals .
Remember to reward a client well for referring you .

Niche networking tools , such as www.freelancealliance.com, part of Freelance UK , are often a good way to find business .
They allow you to network with those in other professions and to collaborate and refer opportunities amongst each other .
The saying ‘ work smarter ’ is an oft over used cliché but there is sound thinking behind it .
Keep meticulous records of the time spent dealing with each client , allowing you to work out which clients or which industries are the most profitable for you .
This will be important to bear in mind when touting for new business .
It is always valuable to keep one eye on the market to allow you to decide where the next expansion will take place .
Do some industry sectors ride the recession storm more than others ?
Are you able to diversify in areas to increase your work offers ?
The most important thing to do in the event of a dry spell is to set a plan that enables you to feel in control of the situation and to alleviate any fear of panic .
It is vital that you are not too scared to pick up the phone .
Consider a ‘ No ’ to be a ‘ Not just now thank you ’ : you should ask leading questions like ‘ What ’s coming up ? ’ , ‘ Who currently supplies you ? ’ or ‘ When might tempt you to give me a try ? ’
Although during a recession short term survival is the main concern , relationships built up over time will yield results .
Talking to other freelancers can offer moral support - many views are shared in the forum on http://forums.freelanceuk.com/ as well as those collaborating on Freelance Alliance
As well as attracting new business , you must also protect your existing business .
At the start of new projects , interview the clients thoroughly and be sure that that they have signed off the contact - this will protect you in the event of a dispute .
During an economic downturn , when you perceive there to be more competition for work , an easy trap to fall into is cutting your fees .
One of the key rules , that you need to be especially diligent to adhere to during a recession is to stand out because of your designs , not your ‘ cheap as chips ’ fees .
Also , run a credit check on any new clients to avoid the nightmare of not being paid for a substantial project .

Chasing debts can be one of the most frustrating elements of being a freelancer , and organisation is vital here .
It is a dull , yet essential part of the job to keep on top of the invoices that you send out and make follows up calls in a timely manner .
If bills are not paid within an acceptable time frame ( anything much more than three months , and alarm bells should be ringing ) , instruct a reputable debt recovery firm to pursue the client for you .
Freelance Alliance offers a service at a reduced cost and only takes 5 % commission .
A professional has a greater chance of recovering a debt and will relieve you of much of the stress of the process .
Another worthwhile investment is legal advice .
It is important that you know your position in the event of either party wishing to cancel the contract halfway through .
Consider also how much notice you require for a cancellation and add a “ late cancellation ” fee to compensate for income lost .
Also consider your position if you are unable to fulfil a contract and need to cancel .
It is also worth looking into insuring your business .
Gingrey warns fellow Georgia Repug Tom Price what to expect next
SCARBOROUGH : Congressman , do you disagree with Rush Limbaugh that Colin Powell should leave the Republican Party ?
PRICE : Look , it ’s not up to Rush Limbaugh to decide who ought to be in the Republican Party .
There are all sorts of wonderful folks across this land who hold dear the fundamental principles that we , as Republicans ...
SCARBOROUGH : Congressman , do you believe that Rush Limbaugh or Dick Cheney are better , quote -- I ’m just using terms that we hear every day on TV and radio -- that they are somehow better Republicans than Colin Powell ?
PRICE : No. Goodness .
The Republican strategist who helped Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman prepare for a possible presidential run says the Republican party is in for a devastating defeat if its guiding lights are Sarah Palin , Rush Limbaugh and Dick Cheney .
" If it 's 2012 and our party is defined by Palin and Limbaugh and Cheney , then we 're headed for a blowout , " says strategist John Weaver , who advised Huntsman and was for years a close adviser to Sen.
John McCain .
" That 's just the truth . "
... " I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us , " says Weaver .
" But I have the feeling that our party maybe wo n't order that prescription in 2012 . "
" If their goal is to increase the Democrats ' numbers in Congress , they 're doing a very good job , " said Rep. Steven LaTourette ( R. , Ohio ) , a moderate who won his seat in 1994 .
" Do they want a permanent minority of 140 people as pure as Caesar 's wife , or a Republican majority that can get them 70 % of the issues that are important to them ?...
If the Democrats said everyone had to look like a Democrat from Massachusetts , they would not be the majority party . "
Tom Price 's
House colleagues find him to be one of the most unpleasant , overly partisan and inflexible members of Congress .
Even the most cursory examination of his voting record shows a lockstep obstructionist and over - the - top extremist who is completely owned by the banking interests -- they 've " donated " $ 901,849 to his career -- and always votes to push forward their agenda , regardless of how devastating the impact on his constituents back in the suburbs north of Atlanta .
This morning former GOP - congressman Joe Scarborough had Price as a guest on his Republican Party propaganda TV show at MSNBC and Price , as unlikely a man for the task as one could imagine , drew a line in the sand separating the GOP from Rush Limbaugh : You 'll recall that the last time a Georgia congressman -- Phil Gingrey -- tried something like this with Limbaugh , he was licking the Pig Man 's pilonidal cyst within 24 hours , groveling and publically begging for forgiveness .
If Price does n't back down , that makes 2 congressional Republicans who have denigrated Limbaugh in the last few days , John Shadegg ( R - AZ ) , hardly anyone 's idea of a profile in courage , having done so last week .
When Obama named Utah's Republican Governor Jon Huntsman , Jr , a mainstream conservative , ambassador to China , people joked that in accepting the job , Huntsman -- whose approval ratings are the highest of any GOP governor in America ( 84 % ) -- was being forced to flee the country to get away from the Limbaugh / Cheney / Coulter wing of the Republican Party which has targeted him as disloyal for cooperating with Obama on issues vital to the citizens of Utah .
Many think Huntsman is positioning himself to pick up the pieces when the hard right 's strategy of all obstructionism all the time shatters what 's left of the GOP in 2010 and 2012 , just like it did when Republicans followed the exact same playbook in 1934 and 1936 after Roosevelt was first elected .
Then it left the Republicans with 17 seats in the Senate and 88 in the House .
Keep in mind , not a single Republican in the House voted for Social Security and the only one who voted for it in the Senate , George Norris , was driven out of the party , then running as an independent and even stripping Nebraska out of the GOP Senate delegation !
Huntsman 's strategy could be looking forward to 2016 .
This morning right - wing propaganda writer Byron York interviewed John Weaver , a Republican political operative close to both Huntsman and John McCain .
Weaver predicts that if the GOP stays on course presenting itself as the Party of No dominated by Cheney , Limbaugh , the teabaggers , far right extremists , and Know Nothings , the effects will be the same as in ' 34 and ' 36 : a blowout This morning 's Official Republican Party Talking Points Dispatch makes it clear that many GOP office - holders are starting to get cold feet that Cheney , Limbaugh , Palin and the Club For Greed extremists have become the ( very ugly ) face of the party they have to run for office on .
After Specter blamed the Club for Greed for his decision to jump the fence , some of the left behind Republicans started " to turn on the organization , saying it backs those who are so conservative that they then lose to Democrats .
"
You may recall how flustered Lindsey Graham was after Specter left the GOP .
" I 'm not looking to be a member of a club , " he lisped .
" The difference between being a club and a national party is being able to play outside your traditional areas . "
That carried over to the South Carolina Republican Party this weekend , where he was booed and harrassed when he defensively tried taking a mainstream conservative approach at a gathering dominated by teabaggers -- who had already tasted Gresham Barrett 's blood last month -- and Ron Paul libertarians .
They reap what they 've sowed : Chris Bowers at Open Left put together this fascinating chart that shows the favorability ratings of the country 's most visable Republican leaders .
Odd that people still hate Bush the most , even more than Cheney .
Maybe they should switch spokespersons and have Cindy McCain out there more and Limbaugh , Newt , Karl Rove and John Boehner a lot less .

Not so long ago , Facebook took some serious slack for its decision to alter its privacy policy .
The new scheme , many worried , could have allowed third parties to tinker with user accounts even after they had been terminated .
Thankfully , Facebook backed off and now it 's turning to users for an alternative .
The original debate surrounded Facebook 's terms of service policy .
Early in February the social networking giant quietly unveiled a rather cold - hearted plan giving the site ownership of its users ' accounts forever -- even if they decided to cut ties with the page .
Understandably , users raged against the policy , and Facebook quickly dropped the issue .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Search " Facebook Site Governance Vote "
However , since it seems intent on resolving the question once and for all , Facebook is now turning to its users for help .
Soon , visitors to Facebook 's site will be allowed to participate in one big vote on two important options :
A new and improved " Facebook Principles and Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ( SRR ) , " heavily inspired by the flood of comments resulting from February 's debate , or
The " Terms of Use " currently in place .
Those interested in taking part in the vote should do so prior to Thursday , April 23 at 11:59 am Pacific time .
A ballot page has been made available ; just search for " Facebook Site Governance Vote " after logging in .
( Source : cnet.com )
60 Million Votes Needed ?
Unfortunately , it wo n't be easy to get the vote to stick .
According to Facebook 's own rules , at least 30 per cent of those people who have logged onto their accounts in the last thirty days must vote for the successful selection to be considered " binding " .
Given that Facebook boasts that it has 200 million active users , some 60 million will need to vote .
Option one 's success would mean that Facebook would have to go through a series of votes like this one in order to tinker with its policies .
That 's clearly very important to a lot of people , but unless 60 million people make their voices heard , there 's no guaranteeing Facebook 's continued attempt to consult its users .
Hear me out — last week 's hearings from the Library of Congress ' Rulemaking on Exemptions from Prohibition on Circumvention of Technological Measures that Control Access to Copyrighted Works were terrifically interesting to observe .
Sure , they might sound as fascinating as last week 's meatloaf , but where else can you hear lawyers don the mantle of outrage and take on Big Content with screeds like this :
Why are they so reflexively confrontational ?
They know that the uses we seek will not harm their market in any way .
They know that whether the exemption is granted or rejected will have absolutely no impact on the level of infringement .
They should welcome our use of their content in our classrooms .
They should make our legal use as easy as possible .
We should n't even have to apply for the exemption .
They should proactively declare that they wo n't bring DMCA actions against higher ed institutions for assembling film compilations .
Instead , they insult us by treating us as potential infringers who ca n’t be trusted to use a technology any 12 - year old can download from the Internet .
Yowza .
That was attorney Jonathan Band , brandishing his rhetorical sword in defense of American libraries .
The last time this issue came up , college libraries won an exemption for film studies professors to rip DVD clips for use in the classroom , something that is generally illegal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Nearly all " circumventions " of DRM are banned by the 1998 law , though every three years the Library of Congress can create narrow exemptions .
This time around , the libraries are reaching for more ; they want to extend the DVD clips exemption to all university professors .
Radical , we know , but even such small changes worry rightsholders , since they chip away at DMCA protections and set increasingly broad precedent for DRM cracking .
Film companies are fine with professors using clips in classes — that 's not the issue — but they would really prefer that people do it without cracking the CSS DRM that has already failed so spectacularly to stop the copying of DVDs .
So rightsholders proposed a few alternatives , showing that cracking DRM was n't needed .
Law professor Rebecca Tushnet , arguing for expanded circumvention rights when amateur videographers want to remix or critique movie clips , said that the DMCA 's restrictions were a " digital literacy test " and that having to buy expensive camcording gear was a " digital poll tax . "
The movie industry said ( again ) that camcording a film off the TV screen was a pretty good solution ( and they should know , since they have plenty of experience busting camcorder - wielding pirates ) .
In fact , a lawyer for the industry showed a video last week of how this could work and what incredible quality the camcorded version could have .
This led attorney Band to say , " If camcording can produce high - quality copies , why does the motion picture industry bother using CSS ?
Why does the industry support the DMCA , and why are we in this hearing ?
We should all go across the street together and ask Congress to repeal the DMCA because it is completely irrelevant . "
Other suggestions ( using screen recorder software , asking a movie studio for written permission each time a new clip would be used in class ) would waste an untold number of hours of US professorial time and might not even work .
Time Warner , for instance , said it be glad to offer permission to professors ... so long as they also received publicity rights approval from the Screen Actors Guild .
And Vista makes screen rips of DVDs more difficult .
But rightsholders at the meeting were determined not to give ground if possible .
If some other solution to circumvention exists , it must be used instead .
Law professor Rebecca Tushnet , arguing for expanded circumvention rights when amateur videographers want to remix or critique movie clips , said that the DMCA 's restrictions were a " digital literacy test " and that having to buy expensive camcording gear was a " digital poll tax . "
One attorney for content owners even reminded the panel of government lawyers chairing the meetings , " The fact that you might have to spend something to take advantage of the alternative " does n't matter ; so long as some alternative can be dreamed up without cracking DRM , an exemption should not be granted .
Not just DVDs
Not all the action related to DVDs .
Cell phone unlocking — which was granted the last time around — was on the table once more .
Even though it has been legal , wireless trade groups still oppose the exemption .
According to Public Knowledge 's Rashi Rangnath , " Mr. Bruce Joseph , representing CTIA , the wireless industry association , maintained that cell phone unlocking might expose other copyrighted works such as games and ring tones contained on cell phones to infringement .
However , other than in the case of Virgin mobile , he conceded that he did not know if software that locked cell phones also locked other content . "
Copyright attorney Wendy Seltzer was also at the hearings , which she characterizes as a " perfect theater of the absurd .
First , the [ Library of Congress ] is authorized to exempt non-infringing users of ' classes of works ' from the circumvention prohibition , but not to legalize the tools needed to circumvent access controls ( which are prohibited by 1201 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) .
That leaves all participants dancing around the question of how users are to exercise their rights , if granted — ' surreal , ' as Jon Band put it .
Likewise , we all ignore the ready availability of DeCSS and the near - instant posting of DRM - free versions of anything issued in ' protected ' format . "
Marybeth Peters , the Register of Copyrights , will make her recommendations to the Librarian of Congress over the next few months .
Any exemptions that the Librarian chooses to grant will go into effect on October 28 and will last for three years — at which point , the process begins all over again .
DRM geeks can now listen to the sessions at the Copyright Office website .

The WHOIS is here .
1. Frame jig - it is used to hold all parts in their exact position .
I have built the frame jig from scrap wooden rods and some lathed parts and connected with screws .
You can also build e.g. adjustable aluminum jig , where you can make the frame geometry according your needs .
As a template of a frame dimensions for construction of a jig , I have used my bike frame that I rode before .
The completed jig was stiff enough and guaranteed the position and the alignment of the metal parts during the construction of the foam core .
2. Metal parts - they include an aluminum bottom bracket shell , head tube , short seat tube , cable stops , rear dropouts and a rear brake bosses .
The used thin walled tubes and cable stops were made on a lathe , for the carbon frame I have purchased rear dropouts and brake bosses from the bike parts supplier .
I have made them by water - jet cutting for the bamboo frame .
I prefer to use 7075 Alloy for the metal parts .
It is good to have all aluminum parts anodized , as then you do not need to wrap a light layer of fiberglass around the aluminum tubes and part of the rear dropouts as an insulation between the aluminum and the carbon against galvanic corrosion .
3 . Foam core - I have used polystyrene foam to make the core of the carbon frame .
But it is better to use extruded polystyrene , or polyurethane foam , which is more rigid .
Later I have used the polyurethane foam which is normally used for insulation of the outer walls of buildings .
4. Materials for laminating - I have chosen a bi-directional woven carbon cloth ( 180 grams per square meter ) .
I have used MGS 's L285 epoxy resin with hardener 285 for laminating .
For the carbon frame I used about 3.8 sq.m of the fabric , for the bamboo frame about 2.0 sq.m .
You can also use uni-directional carbon for the base layers and use the bi-directional carbon just for the outer layer .
5. Supplies - I used plastic kitchen foil for covering the workbench during the wetting out the carbon , latex gloves , a small digital scale for weighing of the exact volume of resin and hardener , cups for mixing , paint brushes for wetting out , lots of electrical tape , sand paper and a good respirator during sanding .
6. Patience - the more the better
I do n’t want to introduce this post by saying why smoking is bad .
I was a smoker in the past .
I quit only because I wanted to have a baby and I believed me smoking was harmful for my child .
But I am still annoyed when people start educating me why smoking is bad .
I think that ’s every person ’s business and choice .
So what I was looking at in the following anti-smoking campaigns is not the educative value ( I personally doubt smokers are n’t aware of the risk already ) but creativity and original idea ( the way it was implemented ) .
Street campaigns :
Stop Smoking Bus Advertisement : “ Ready to quit ? ”
Smoke Is Poison Advertisement : 12 meter long chemical tanker that looks like a giant cigarette was used by Cancer Research UK to highlight the toxic smoke in cigarettes ( via toxel.com ) .
Bus stop anti-smoking campaign :
“ What we see when you smoke ”
This one from the Cancer Patient Aid Association was put on the roofs of outdoor smoking areas ( via inventorspot.com ) :
Anti-smoking promotion for ‘ World No Tobacco Day ’ found at coffee shops in Dubai , where people come to smoke ( via inventorspot.com ) :
“ Fight Smoking “ : an ad campaign throughout the gyms :
Anti-smoking campaign as a stylish piece :
This anti-smoking hat looks both stylish and scary ( via moolf.com )
Print negative advertisements :
“ For more information on lung cancer , keep smoking ”
“ Before it ’s too late ”
Wyoming Department of Health : “ Do n’t secondsmoke the messenger ”
“ Second hand smoke in the home hospitalises 17,000 UK children a year ” ( the campaign for Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation , the UK medical research charity dedicated to dedicated to defeating lung cancer ) :
Another campaign for Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation : Deathbed :
“ Smoking causes premature ageing ”
“ There is an easier way of committing suicide : try smoking ”
“ It ’s called suicide because it ’s your choice .
Give up smoking : 0 8008 700 700 ”
“ Non-smoking area ”

Das Guttenberg - Dossier ( Teil 1 )
Teil 1 : Der Zögling
Von FRIEDERIKE BECK
Als uns vor kurzem der neuen Wirtschaftsminister Karl - Theodor von und zu Guttenberg präsentiert wurde , stellte sich bald ziemlich alles , was über seine angebliche Erfahrung in der „ freien Wirtschaft “ berichtet wurde , als falsch heraus .
Aus den Medien war und ist außer nachweislichen Falschinformationen und Plattitüden kaum etwas Sachdienliches zu erfahren .
Wer aber ist zu Guttenberg wirklich , woher kommt er ?
Und wofür steht er? zeitgeist - Autorin Friederike Beck begab sich auf Spurensuche und fand erstaunlich Brisantes .
Ihr Beitrag gibt aber auch Einblick in eine Form des investigativen Journalismus , die man eigentlich von den großen Nachrichtenmagazinen zu erwarten hätte ...
Aufgrund der Fülle des Materials wird das „ Guttenberg - Dossier “ in mehreren Teilen veröffentlicht – exklusiv auf zeitgeist Online .
Anzeige(n )
Karl - Theodor , unser neuer Wirtschaftsminister … von und zu Guttenberg auf einem Wirtschaftposten – das ist gelinde gesagt merkwürdig , außer man ist der Ansicht , wer Verkehr könne , könne auch Außenpolitik und wer Außenpolitik , der auch Wirtschaft und wer Wirtschaft , der auch Innenpolitik usw .
Oder man ist ohnehin der Meinung , dass entsprechende Politik nur von Fachberatern und Experten im Hintergrund gemacht wird und ein Minister habe nicht viel zu besagen .
Dennoch : Deutschland hat als Wirtschaftsminister in Zeiten einer Weltwirtschaftskrise nun jemanden , der als erklärtes Hobby die Außenpolitik hat .
Die angebliche Erfahrung des Aufsteigers in der freien Wirtschaft stellte sich inzwischen als eine Gesellschaft zu Verwaltung des eigenen Familienvermögens heraus , die es seit einigen Jahren nicht mehr gibt .
Keinesfalls handelte es sich dabei , wie allseits vermutet , um ein fränkisches Unternehmen , das Dämmstoffe u. ä. herstellt .
Guttenbergs Vater Enoch kann die Millionen unmöglich mit dem Dirigentenstöckchen herbeigezaubert haben
Laut SPIEGEL ( 11/2009 ) wird das Familienvermögen des feschen Freiherrn auf ca. 600 Millionen Euro geschätzt .
Die Familie von und zu Guttenberg , die auf ihrem Schloss im Fränkischen bei Kulmbach residiert , gehört damit zu den 300 reichsten Familien bzw .
Personen Deutschlands .
Wenn die Informationen des SPIEGEL stimmen , vermisst man eine nachvollziehbare Angabe darüber , wie dieses unvorstellbare Vermögen aufgehäuft werden konnte .
Adel steht , das weiß jeder , längst nicht mehr für noble Verhältnisse ; vielmehr übte man sich – besonders nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg – oft eher in der edlen Kunst des stilvollen Verarmens .
Und das Heizen von alten Schlössern geht auch ganz schön ins Geld .
Auch „ KT ’s “ Vater Enoch ( ein Dirigent , der wirklich gute Musik macht ) kann diese Millionen unmöglich mit dem Dirigentenstöckchen herbeigezaubert haben .
Die Frage nach dem „ Woher “ steht also unbedingt im Raum , zumal Karl - Theodor nachweislich nie in der „ Freien Wirtschaft “ tätig war :
Er ist promovierter Jurist und arbeitete ein Jahr lang in einer New Yorker Kanzlei .
Welcher ist unbekannt .
Gutti geizt ganz offensichtlich mit genauen Informationen über seine wirtschaftlichen Umstände und seinen beruflichen und politischen Werdegang .
Seine Homepage ist schütter und dürftig .
Aber diese falsche Bescheidenheit in Sachen Angaben zur eigenen Person , auf die in einer Demokratie die Öffentlichkeit nun einmal Anspruch hat , dürfte einigen Hintergrund haben .
Die Ernennung des 37 - Jährigen stets gut Gegelten in ein Ministeramt ( auch wenn , wie wir noch sehen werden , wohl eher das Außen - und nicht das Wirtschaftsamt angepeilt wurde ) hatte sich schon früher abgezeichnet – wenn man genauer hingeschaut hätte .
Als Indikator kann schon 2002 Guttenbergs Berufung in den Auswärtigen Ausschuss des Bundestages zeitgleich mit seiner Wahl in den deutschen Bundestag für die CSU ( Wahlkreis Kulmbach ) im sensationell zarten Alter von nur 31 Jahren gelten .
Vorher hatte Guttenberg allerdings schon bei der CSU im Fachausschuss Außenpolitik gesessen und einige Jahre als CSU - Politiker hinter sich – wie viele erfährt man nicht .
„ Das Geheimnis des schwarzen Barons “ lautet der Titel eines Porträts zu Guttenbergs im FOCUS , Heft 13/2009 .
Der Artikel selbst lüftet es jedoch nicht .
Stattdessen gehen die Redakteure lediglich auf sein Erfolgsgeheimnis ein ( Welcher Erfolg eigentlich ?
Er hat doch noch gar nichts geleistet … oder etwa doch , hinter verschlossenen Türen ? ) , welches in seinem schon immer vorhandenem grenzenlosem Selbstbewusstsein und seinem Bemühen , nicht den Eindruck eines abgehobenen Aristokraten zu vermitteln , verortet wird .
„ Er wurde bereits in jungen Jahren auf eine spätere Führungsaufgabe vorbereitet … “
Wie kommt es nun , dass ein so junger Parlamentarier , der gerade erst in den Bundestag gewählt wurde und Außenpolitik bisher nur auf CSU - Parteiebene betrieben hat , sogleich in dieses bedeutsame Gremium weitergeleitet wird ?
Worin bestand seine „ Qualifikation “ ?
Auf Guttis Webseite heißt es dazu : „ Seine Berufung in diesen Ausschuss war für einen neu gewählten Parlamentarier sehr ungewöhnlich .
Der 31 - jährige CSU - Politiker ist zudem das jüngste Mitglied in diesem Gremium . “
Eben .
Eine Frage ist jedoch keine Antwort , und so beschloss ich , mein Wissen über den Auswärtigen Ausschuss etwas aufzufrischen .
Der Auswärtige Ausschuss
Auf der Homepage des Deutschen Bundestages heißt es über die Befugnisse und Aufgaben des Auswärtigen Ausschusses ( Ich habe die mir wichtig erscheinenden Hinweise unterstrichen ) :
Klassisch politisch und hochsensibel
Der Auswärtige Ausschuss ist ein von der Verfassung privilegierter Ausschuss , er gehört zu den vier Ausschüssen , die das Grundgesetz fest vorschreibt .
Als klassischer politischer Ausschuss begleitet er die auswärtige Regierungspolitik vor allem im Vorfeld wichtiger außen - und sicherheitspolitischer Entscheidungen .
Grundsätzlich arbeitet er hinter verschlossenen Türen .
Denn seine Beratungsthemen sind hochsensibel .
So beraten seine Mitglieder federführend , ob die Bundesregierung deutsche Soldaten zu Auslandseinsätzen entsenden darf .
(…) Die Pflege der Beziehungen zu auswärtigen Staaten ist Sache des Bundes , genauer Sache der Bundesregierung .
Sowohl für die Übertragung von Hoheitsrechten auf zwischenstaatliche Einrichtungen , als auch für Verträge , welche die politischen Beziehungen des Bundes regeln oder sich auf Gegenstände der Bundesgesetzgebung beziehen , schreibt das Grundgesetz aber die Mitwirkung des Parlaments vor .
In der Praxis ist es der Auswärtige Ausschuss , über den diese Mitwirkung stattfindet .
(…)
Federführend für das Plenum des Bundestages werden diese Entscheidungen vom Auswärtigen Ausschuss nach eingehenden Beratungen vorbereitet .
Bisher ist das Plenum in keinem einzigen Fall von einer Empfehlung des Auswärtigen Ausschusses abgewichen .
Die Ernennung des 37 - Jährigen stets gut Gegelten in ein Ministeramt hatte sich schon früher abgezeichnet – wenn man genauer hingeschaut hätte
Der Auswärtige Ausschuss ist also faktisch das Gremium , das hochsensible ( = hochgeheime ) sicherheitspolitische ( = den Einsatz des Militärs betreffende ) Entscheidungen hinter verschlossenen Türen fällt .
Der deutsche Militäreinsatz in Afghanistan etwa wurde und wird hier entschieden .
Die Zustimmung des Bundestages ist faktisch nur noch eine Formalität , da er bisher , wie offen zugegeben wird , in keinem einzigen (!)
Fall von den Vorgaben dieses Ausschusses abgewichen ist .
Welche Voraussetzungen qualifizierten Gutti für dieses hochsensible Gremium ?
Entscheidend für die umstandslose Inkorporierung Guttenbergs in den Auswärtigen Ausschuss des Deutschen Bundestages , der , wie wir gesehen haben , nur formal ein Beratungsgremium , aber faktisch ein Entscheidungsgremium ist , muss seine Mitgliedschaft in der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik ( DGAP ) zu Berlin gewesen sein .
Über den genauen Zeitpunkt seiner Aufnahme ist wieder nichts zu eruieren , sie muss jedoch schon vor 2002 erfolgt sein .
Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik
Es wird daher Zeit , einmal die DGAP etwas kritisch zu beäugen : Ein Blick auf die aktuelle Mitgliederliste zeigt eine interessante Mixtur aus einflussreichen Politikern , Wirtschaftskapitänen , Bankenbossen und Medienmogulen .
Die DGAP firmiert auch unter German Council on Foreign Relations , was ihre abhängige Verwandtschaft zum entsprechenden US - amerikanischen Einflussgremium „ CFR “ verdeutlicht .
Die DGAP ist also ein direkter „ Kaktusableger “ des CFR .
Über den Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) ist schon vieles geschrieben worden , und hier ist nicht der Ort , all dies wieder aufzufrischen .
Es kann jedoch kein Zweifel daran bestehen , dass es sich bei dieser Gesellschaft um ein äußerst einflussreiches Gremium handelt , dass sich gerne als „ Denkfabrik “ apostrophiert .
Die finanziell hochpotenten Kreise , die den CFR unterhalten , haben eine klare Vorstellung davon , wie die Welt nach ihrem Wunsch und Willen modelliert werden soll .
Diese Vorstellungen überschneiden sich streckenweise mit neoliberalen , neokonservativen oder US - amerikanischen geostrategischen Interessen , kommen aber nie 100 % ig mit diesen zur Deckung , denn es handelt sich um Interessen „ sui generis . “
Die Aufnahme in dieses Einflussgremium steht folglich nicht jedem politisch Interessierten offen , sondern erfolgt nach eigenen Regeln .
Der CFR unterhält ein von David Rockefeller bezahltes Denkfabrikprogramm , dass sich in drei Zentren unterteilt : Das Center für Präventivaktionen , das Greenberg Center für geoökonomische Studien und das Zentrum für universale Erziehung .
Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik ist ein direkter „ Kaktusableger “ des CFR
An diesen Zentren geschieht bei geeigneten Kandidaten Hirnmassage auf höchstem Niveau , und der Blickwinkel der Stipendiaten und dort Forschenden wird kunstvoll so geformt und eingeengt , bis sie zu perfekten Transformatoren der Ideen von Rockefeller , Kissinger und Associates werden und ihnen deren Gedanken und Strategien als ihre eigenen erscheinen .
Die hier geformten Ideen werden dann in einer unübersehbaren Zahl von Publikationen ( Büchern , Zeitschriften , Gastkommentaren ) und anderen Kommunikationsmedien in den Mainstream abgelaicht und als die jeweils eigenen Denkprodukte verkauft .
Natürlich gelingt es nicht immer , einen gewissen „ Stallgeruch “ wegzuparfümieren .
Künstlerische Naturen nennen so etwas dann „ Zeitgeist “ .
CFR : Die Erfindung des Zeitgeistes
Ein solches Zeitgeistphänomen ist der sog .
„ Kampf gegen den Internationalen Terrorismus “ .
Es ist vielleicht das hervorstechendste , aber keineswegs das einzige .
Ähnlich wichtige Zeitgeistphänomene sind z. B. die „ Globalisierung “ oder die „ Liberalisierung der Weltmärkte “ .
Ein paar Worte zu ersterem Zeitgeistphänomen :
Es ist schon amüsant zu lesen , wie sich die hochkarätigen CFR - Politikforscher um gewisse Erscheinungen des internationalen Terrorismus sorgen , obwohl ihre Quellenlage doch eigentlich um ein Vielfaches besser sein müsste , als die eines harmlosen Nachrichtenkonsumenten , der das Weltgeschehen und seine Hintergründe mühsam mithilfe von Puzzleteilchen und Brosamen erklären muss , die aus dieser Herren Mundwinkel fallen .
Mithin müssten also ihre Möglichkeiten zur Ursachenforschung um ein Vielfaches höher liegen .
Hier half die Arbeitshypothese weiter , dass es auch innerhalb des CFR eine Sprachregelung geben muss .
Henry Kissinger etwa , zeitweiliger Präsident und Dauergast des CFR , lässt keine Gelegenheit aus , öffentlich vor den Gefahren des internationalen Terrorismus zu warnen .
Wenn man seine Lebensbilanz in dieser Hinsicht analysiert , fragt man sich eigentlich , wie es zu solch einer Begriffsverwirrung hatte kommen können .
Ich denke daher , dass es nicht dasselbe sein muss , wenn zwei Personen das „ T - Wort “ gebrauchen .
„ Warnen “ ist ja mittlerweile ein Reizwort mit Allergiefaktor geworden .
Wenn Schäuble , der in solchen Machtmanagementgremien ein häufig anzutreffender Gast ist , wieder einmal warnt , was eigentlich mittlerweile täglich der Fall ist , sollte man sich umgehend fragen :
Was ist da im Denktank nur wieder ausgeschwitzt worden ?
Zufällig stieß ich im Netz auf einen Beleg für eine solche „ Sprachregelung “ :
Es handelt sich um ein Interview vom 16.12.2006 mit Meyrav Wurmser , der Gattin des Cheney - Beraters für den Nahen Osten David Wurmser .
George Bushs ehemaliger Vizepräsident Dick Cheney wiederum war einige Jahre Präsident des CFR .
Dr. Meyrav Wurmser ( Hudson Institut ) steht für eine Gruppe einflussreicher „ Neocon “ - Denker und Think - Tanker , welche die US - Politik inspirierten und wird von Ynet gefragt : „ Haben Sie praktisch den Krieg im Irak herbeigeführt ? “
Antwort : „ Wir haben Ideen geäußert , aber die Politik im Irak wurde den Neocons sehr schnell aus der Hand genommen .
Die Idee war , dass Amerika einen Krieg gegen den Terror hat , und dass der einzige Ort , um damit fertig zu werden , im Nahen Osten ist , und dass ein fundamentaler Wandel durch das Auswechseln der Führerschaft kommen würde .
Wir mussten irgendwo anfangen . “
Die vom CFR angewandte Sprachregelung hinsichtlich der Vokabel „ War on Terror “ scheint wie folgt zu funktionieren :
Unter den meisten ihrer Stipendiaten und Forschern , und natürlich in die Weltöffentlichkeit getragen , bedeutet die Vokabel etwas Konkretes , das , was wir eben alle darunter zu verstehen glauben .
Auf einer höheren Ebene der Denkfabrik ( Vorstand , führende Think - Tanker ) wird der Terminus „ War on Terror “ als ein politisches Konzept begriffen , als eine Idee eben , mit der man konkrete politische Ziele erreichen kann .
Daher ist es mitnichten dasselbe , wenn zwei Personen das T - Wort benutzen !
Dieses ist nur in besonders eklatantes Beispiel für eine Politik der Sprachregelung , die sich bei anderen Themen natürlich ebenso wieder finden lässt .
Aus dem Pool sorgfältig ausgebildeter Nachwuchsdarsteller für die Bühne der ( Außen - ) Politik entsendet der CFR seine Favoriten immer wieder direkt in die amerikanische Politik .
Daher muss die Annahme verneint werden , der CFR sei lediglich eine
Art geniales Beratergremium , wo sich Mitglieder einer Denkfabrik gleichsam schwitzend wie in einer Sauna , aber selbstlos und ohne eigenen Ehrgeiz , konkret in die Politik einzugreifen , neue Konzepte und Lösungen für Probleme der Außenpolitik ausdenken .
Es kann getrost davon ausgegangen werden , dass der CFR als Ideen - und Konzeptgeber übergeordnet ist und sich nicht nur auf das Denken beschränkt , sondern auch handelt .
Der CFR kennt zwei Sorten von Mitgliedschaft : die auf Lebenszeit und die auf Zeit .
Die Mitgliedschaft auf Zeit ist auf fünf Jahre begrenzt , die lebenslange kann man nicht per Antragsformular erwerben – Vollmitglieder werden sorgfältigst auserlesen : Ein solcher Kandidat muss von einem CFR - Vollmitglied schriftlich empfohlen werden und weitere drei Empfehlungsschreiben wichtiger Personen , die vorzugsweise auch dem CFR angehören , vorweisen können .
Manche Bewerber werden trotz alle Empfehlungen nie erwählt .
Auf diese Weise stellt der CFR seine höchsteigene dynastische Kontinuität sicher .
Ganz ähnliche Auswahlverfahren finden sich in allen bedeutenden Einflussgremien ähnlicher Provenienz .
Die von CFR & Co. geformten Ideen werden in einer unübersehbaren Zahl von Publikationen in den Mainstream abgelaicht
David Rockefeller war mit dem ererbten Reichtum seiner Familie ( Erdöl , Banken ) ab 1975 Präsident und Spiritus Rektor des CFR .
Er bezahlte ein beeindruckendes Netz von Einfluss - und Entscheidungsgremien , wie u. a. die Trilaterale Kommission , in deren Vorstand er saß , oder den Council on the Americas .
Auch bei den exklusiven Bilderberger - Treffen wurde er gesichtet .
Bei einem Treffen der Trilateralen Kommission 1991 soll Rockefeller gesagt haben : „ Die supranationale Souveränität von einer intellektuellen Elite und von Weltbankern ist sicherlich der nationalen Selbstbestimmung , die in vergangenen Jahrhunderten praktiziert wurde , vorzuziehen .
“

Auch wenn ich nicht bei dem Treffen der Trilateralen dabei war , so beschreibt das Zitat doch sehr anschaulich den programmatischen Soll - Zustand und führt uns auf das Thema „ Eliten “ bzw .
Elitenmanagement des CFR zurück .
An diesem Punkt kann man zusammenfassend bereits sagen :
Es besteht der begründete Verdacht , dass sich zu Guttenberg für den wichtigen Auswärtigen Ausschuss im Bundestag über seine Mitgliedschaft bei der DGAP , die – wie oben erwähnt – ein Ableger des CRF ist , qualifizierte .
Ob das aber seine einzige Prädestinierung war ?
Im Führungsgremium des CFR finden sich immer wieder Namen , die man aus der Politik kennt ( z. B. Ex-Außenministerin Madeleine Albright , Ex- Verteidigungsminister Colin Powell ) , aber auch viele Namen aus Industrie und Bankensektor , die nicht so im Rampenlicht stehen .
Der Außenpolitik - Dino Henry Kissinger etwa zelebriert eine Vielzahl weihevoller Konferenzen vor den Augen von Würdenträgern aus Wirtschaft , Militär und Politik , wo er wegweisende Dinoeier legt ( für ca. 25.000 Dollar pro Nachmittag ! ) , die dann von wissbegierigen jungen Aktentaschenträgern ausgebrütet werden dürfen .
Selbstverständlich wurde auch zu Guttenberg an der Seite der üblen alten Außenpolitik - Diva mit der Gänsehautstimme ( und warum diese Bezeichnung völlig untertrieben ist – darauf komme ich noch später zurück ) gesichtet : Am 11.11.2007 z. B. fand in der New Yorker Carnegie Hall die Konferenz „ Political Berlin “ , ausgerichtet von der American Academy , statt .
Bilder von der Konferenz finden sich auf deren Homepage .

Unter „ Meet the artist “ heißt es u. a.:
KARL -THEODOR FREIHERR ZU GUTTENBERG
Baron zu Guttenberg is a member of the German Parliament ( CSU ) and Chairman of the CSU ’s Committee on Foreign Affairs .
In Berlin he serves as Department Spokesman for the CDU / CSU Parliamentary Group on the Foreign Affairs Committee and as Spokesman for Non-Proliferation and Arms Control .
Before being elected into Parliament , he was head of the Guttenberg family ’s companies in Munich and Berlin , and gained work experience in Frankfurt and New York .
Baron zu Guttenberg was Managing Director of the Guttenberg GmbH ( Munich ) and is a member on several boards .
Prior to this position , he studied law and completed a doctoral thesis on comparative constitutional law ( JD ) .
Guttenberg has published many articles on foreign and European policy as well as on the period between 1933 and 1945 in Germany .
( His family was actively involved in the resistance against Hitler . )
He is married to his wife , Stephanie .
They have two daughters .
An der unterstrichenen Stelle wird behauptet , Guttenberg habe viele Artikel über die Periode zwischen 1933 und 1945 geschrieben und dass „ seine [ Guttenbergs ] Familie aktiv am Widerstand gegen Hitler beteiligt war . “
Auf diese Angabe ( im doppelten Wortsinn ) kommen wir später zurück .
Die Ankündigung der Carnegie Hall zeigt eine merkwürdige Asymmetrie bei den „ Künstlern “ ; die Personalien des Programms sind so kombiniert , als würde man die Sängerin Kiri te Kanawa zusammen mit dem Poppelsdorfer Pupenchor ankündigen , aber halt , nur auf den ersten Blick : Denn zwar ist „ Kissi “ ( der mit dem Todeskuss ) ein echtes Schwergewicht der Außenpolitik mit einer außenpolitischen Mortalitätsbilanz im Hekatombenbereich , doch auch Gutti hat Bedeutung : Er saß 2007 schon seit fünf Jahren im Auswärtigen Ausschuss des Bundestages , der diesen ja faktisch bindend berät …
Ich mache mir einfach Sorgen , ob sich zu Guttenberg noch in guter Gesellschaft befindet
Deutsche und amerikanische Experten diskutierten bei dem Event Berlins Rolle in internationalen Angelegenheiten .
Neben Henry Kissinger durften Freiherr zu Guttenberg , ZEIT / SZ - Herausgeber Joffe , der frühere US - Botschafter John C. Kornblum und Vorstand der Investmentbank Lazard Germany sowie Richard Holbrooke als Vorsitzender der American Academy in Berlin miteinander reden .
Richard Holbrooke , war da nicht was ?
Ja richtig , Holbrooke , der ebenso wie Kissinger fließend Deutsch spricht , arbeitete ebenfalls für die Nixon - Administration als Indonesien - Berater .
Er und Kissi gaben militärische Unterstützung für die grausame Invasion des Inselstaats Osttimor durch Indonesien .
In ihrem Gefolge starben ca. 200.000 Menschen .
In den 1980ern war Holbrooke dann unter Reagan Ostasienberater und mitverantwortlich für die Rücknahme des Abzugs der US - Truppen aus Südkorea .
Er stellte die US - amerikanische operative Militärleitung unter einem US - südkoreanischen Kommando wieder her .
Dies führte zu Studentenprotesten , die 1980 mit amerikanischer Rückendeckung brutal im sog .
Gwangju - Massaker niedergeschlagen wurden .
Aber dies soll ja kein Artikel über Holbrooke werden – ich mache mir einfach nur Sorgen , ob sich Gutti noch in guter Gesellschaft befindet ?
Die American Academy und der German Council on Foreign Relations sind jedoch nicht die einzigen transatlantischen Einflussgremien , bei deren Festivitäten und Ausbildungsprogrammen Gutti gesichtet wurde .
Der American Council on Germany
Der American Council on Germany ( ACG ) etwa kümmert sich in vielerlei Hinsicht um Deutschland .
Z. B. vermittelt er verschiedene Stipendienprogramme , die deutschen Journalisten einen Amerikaaufenthalt bis zu vier Wochen im Jahr ermöglichen , Tagesgeld von 200 Dollar , Flug und Zug inklusive .
Dieser Amerikanische Deutschlandrat vermittelt Deutschen , die dort ein Lernprogramm absolvieren , Kontakte zu höchsten Kreisen der Hochfinanz , Wirtschaft , Militär , Medien .
Ziel ist die stetige Einhaltung und Bewusstwerdung des amerikanischen Blickwinkels des Weltgeschehens und die Umsetzung US - amerikanischer Prinzipien und Ziele in den so bedeutsamen Bereichen Geostrategie und Wirtschaft ( Globalisierung und Finanzen ) .
Dies wird durch diverse Trainingsprogramme durch die Alumni immer wieder eingeübt .
Der Amerikanische Deutschlandrat tagt und berät quasi permanent ; ein besonderes Herzensanliegen ist ihm , die Verständigung der Finanzfunktionseliten beider Länder zu fördern , denen der Rat eine Art Dauerforum bietet .
Auf der Homepage des ACG liest man nicht umsonst „ programming “ , denn hier werden „ Young Leaders alumni “ regelmäßig von älteren „ Leaders “ programmiert .
Die Fotos zeigen Merkel , Guttenberg und den Ex-Staatssekretär im Verteidigungsministerium Friedbert Pflüger , erstere noch vor ihrer Amtsergreifung , vermutlich also noch im Modus „ Young Leader alumna “ bei einer Programmierung 2002 .
So wundert man sich gerade bei SPIEGEL ONLINE , was für eine gute Figur Guttenberg in New York gemacht und wie selbstverständlich er mit dem großen alten Finanzspekulatius George Soros diniert habe .
Nicht schon wieder !
Natürlich kennt Gutti diese Kreise seit Jahren , denn er ist bei diesen alten Führern als Young - Leader - Schüler in die Lehre gegangen , und auch wenn sich der alte Hexenmeister einmal weg begeben sollte , dorthin , wo Geld gar nichts mehr wert und seine Konten von einem ganz anderen verwaltet werden , so macht das gar nichts aus : Seine Besen werden hienieden auch weiterhin fegen und nach seinen Worten wesen .
Präsident des ACG ist – Henry Kissinger !
Die Liste der „ Lecturers “ ( Dozenten ) gibt einen recht realistischen Überblick über die Machtverhältnisse in den USA und in der Bundesrepublik .
Die Veranstaltung vom 12./13.1.2006 z. B. zeigt ein typisches Teilnehmermix : Greenspan , JP Morgan , Goldman Sachs , Madeleine Albright , Merkel usw .
Merkel stellte klar , dass sie an einer engen Kooperation mit George W. Bush interessiert sei .
Jedwedem
Thema werde sie mit einer pragmatischen Haltung begegnen , versprach sie .
Motto der Veranstaltung war das gemeinsame Bauen an einer globalen Agenda und ein wesentlich höherer Beitrag Deutschlands daran und an militärischen Anstrengungen …
Da schlägt einem als deutscher Bürger schon das Herz höher – natürlich vor Begeisterung .
Der damalige US - Botschafter Robert Kimmitt hielt bei diesem Polit - Event eine Rede , in der er seine Besorgnis über die deutsche Debatte über Hedgefonds ( hochspekulative Finanzprodukte ) äußerte .
Dies halte er für gefährlich .
Das ist interessant zu lesen , 2009 , im Nachhinein … , nicht wahr ?
Der Amerikanische Deutschlandrat vermittelt deutschen Stipendiaten Kontakte zu höchsten Kreisen der Hochfinanz , Wirtschaft , Militär , Medien
Nicht , dass ich dagegen wäre , dass sich auch mal Banker , Militärs und Konzernbosse tief in die Augen blicken und sich transatlantische Zöglinge erwählen ; im Gegenteil , das wäre auch gut so – allerdings finde ich den Anschein krass , dass deutsche Funktionseliten ( Merkel , Guttenberg etc. ) in den USA oder in US - Machtmanagementgremien in Deutschland , die jeder demokratischen Kontrolle entzogen sind , für zukünftige entsprechende Politik programmiert wurden .
Das Young Leaders Programm des American Council on Germany beschreibt seine Aufgabe wie folgt :
The American Council on Germany reaches out to the next generation of decision - makers and opinion leaders by organizing conferences to familiarize them with key transatlantic issues and to enable them to establish a network of contacts across the Atlantic .
American - German Young Leaders Conferences bring together about 50 Germans and Americans and take place on an annual basis .
The first Young Leaders Study Group on the Future of Europe convened 37 Young Leaders from Western Europe , Poland , Russia , and the United State four times over the course of two years .
Zu deutsch : „ Das ACG greift [ also ] nach der nächsten Generation von Entscheidungs - Machern und Meinungs - Führern , indem er Konferenzen organisiert , um sie mit transatlantischen [ ein Schlüsselwort für US - amerikanisch ]
Schlüsselthemen bekannt zu machen und sie in die Lage zu versetzen , ein Netzwerk von Kontakten über den Atlantik hinüber zu errichten .
Die Amerikanisch - Deutschen - Junge - Führer - Konferenzen bringen ungefähr 50 Deutsche und Amerikaner zusammen und finden jährlich statt .
Die erste Junge - Führer - Lern-Gruppe über die Zukunft Europas versammelte 37 junge Führer aus Westeuropa , Polen , Russland und den Vereinigten Staaten über 2 Jahre hinweg viermal . “
Netzwerken , Weben und Spinnen : Das ist es , worauf bei den Trainingsprogrammen wert gelegt wird .
Darin ist man : „ Hut ab ! “ Es gibt eine schier unübersehbare Anzahl von elitebrütenden Einflussnetzwerken .
Die Einsicht in ihr völlig ungebremstes Wirken , bereitet mindestens schwere Schwindelattacken , im schlimmsten Fall mit Erbrechen einhergehend .
Die Academies , Councils , Foundation und Panels tun alle recht unabhängig und independent , jedoch ist es mit dieser Unabhängigkeit voneinander gerade soweit her , wie bei King und Kong und Ping und Pong .
Das ungenierte , sorgfältige Heranzüchten von deutschen „ Führern “ und „ Meinungsmachern “ im Sinne US - amerikanischer neoliberaler und neokonservativer Interessen wäre an sich völlig unproblematisch , wenn es denn von den Medien transparent gemacht und in der Öffentlichkeit diskutiert würde .
Dieser Vorgang wird jedoch entscheidend erschwert dadurch , dass zukünftige Medien - „ Führer “ und Journalisten ja ebenfalls die Trainingsprogramme durchlaufen , und finanzkräftige Kooperationspartner wie die Bucerius - Stiftung ( ZEIT - Herausgeber ) sorgen dafür , dass das in Deutschland auch so bleibt .
Vielleicht bin ich altmodisch und habe nicht bemerkt , dass eine Dauerwelle nicht mehr in ist , aber sollten die Europäer ihre Eliten nicht lieber selbst ausbilden und das Entscheidungsmachen demokratisch dem Volk überlassen ?
Der American Council on Germany gibt sich nicht einmal die Mühe , im Sinne einer demokratischen Fassade wenigstens verbal an sich zu halten .
Mit Führern haben wir Deutschen ja schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht und zucken schon zusammen , wenn wir dieses
Wort nur hören .
In Deutschland werden die Führervokabeln dieser US - Machtmanagementgremien daher auch konsequent nichts in Deutsche übersetzt , man zuckt als Deutscher so weniger .
Guttenberg kommt also neben seiner Herkunft aus altem , deutschen Adel noch aus einem anderen „ Zuchtstall “ , der ihn viel nachhaltiger geprägt hat , so steht zu fürchten .
Wie zu lesen war , entspringt er einem sorgfältigen jahrelangen US - amerikanischen politischen Zöglingsprogramm für deutsche ( und europäische ) Eliten ( „ Young Leaders “ ) und ist mittlerweile erfolgreich in einer „ Leading Position “ implemetiert worden .
Für Deutschland heißt es nach Merkel nun ein weiteres Mal : „ Mission accomplished “ .
Mit der frühzeitigen Beweihräucherung der „ Alumni “ als „ Young Leaders “ wird den transatlantischen Nachwuchsschauspielern über einen etwaigen Schmerz hinweggeholfen : erkennen zu müssen , dass sie eigentlich nur „ Young Followers “ sind .
Wenn man sich die Schnittmenge von Personalien wie Ex-Verkehrminister Matthias Wissmann , Pflüger und Guttenberg anschaut , steht allerdings zu befürchten , dass diese Befürchtung unbegründet ist .
Nichtsdestotrotz gestehe ich , dass ich stellvertretend für „ Gutti “ einen Schmerz gespürt habe : den der Scham
Nichtsdestotrotz gestehe ich , dass ich stellvertretend für Gutti einen Schmerz gespürt habe : den der Scham .
Der in den letzten Jahren von allen Medien in Deutschland quasi einhellig beschworene , mit fast religiöser Inbrunst zu einer inneren Notwendigkeit hochstilisierte Siegeszug des Neoliberalismus , der Deregulierung der Finanzmärkte , der Globalisierung , entpuppt sich so als eine bewusst von transatlantisch inspirierten und implementierten Meinungs - „ Machern “ und „ Entscheidungsträgern “ eingeläutete Epoche .
Diese entspringen ebensolchen Trainingsprogrammen .
Im Moment haben wir weltweit die absurde Situation , dass diejenigen , die mit dem bejubelten Siegeszug des Neoliberalismus die Krise erst herbeigeführt haben , diese nun mit denselben Mitteln beheben sollen .
Denn nichts anderes haben sie über Jahre gelernt und für etwas anderes wurden sie nicht programmiert .
Ich erlaube mir also schwarz zu sehen .
Auf Seite 3 des „ Transatlantic Dialogue “ , Ausgabe 1/2005 , dem Newsletter des American Council on Germany , lesen wir : „ Young Leader alumnus and Bundestag Member Karl - Theodor Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg ( CSU ) spoke to the gathering at the Staatsbibliothek about the growing complexity and occasional turbulence of the German - American relationship . “
Will sagen , unser zukünftiger Wirtschaftsminister machte sich damals Gedanken über ( wenn auch nur gelegentliche , Gott - sei - Dank - nur - ) Turbulenzen in der Deutsch - Amerikanischen Beziehung .
Auf Seite 4 finden wir folgende Bildunterschrift : Young Leader alumnus and Bundestag Member Karl - Theodor Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg .
Ziel all dieser Netzwerkerei ist vor allem :
Den „ Antiamerikanismus “ klein zu halten , bzw .
das , was man als solchen definiert .
Dies ist : jedwede Kritik an der Ausrichtung amerikanische Außenpolitik , die einem anderen Blickwinkel entspringt , als dem , welcher von den besagten Einflussgremien noch toleriert wird .
Vor allem Standpunkte , die einem Hirn entströmen , das wie durch ein Wunder noch selbstständig denken kann .
Besonders verpönt sind hierbei Standpunkte , die auf eine unterschiedlose Anwendung des internationalen Völkerrechtes , der unterschiedlosen Anwendung von Menschenrechten und – besonders im Kriegsfalle – der Genfer Konventionen pochen .
Ziel ist weiterhin , amerikanische Interessen als im Prinzip deckungsgleich mit den Interessen der Deutschen bzw .
Europäer zu definieren .
Amerikanische Sicherheitspolitik : Ziel ist die möglichst vollständige Einbindung und Inverantwortnahme der Deutschen .
Kampf gegen die größte Gefahr : Das Konzept de Gaulles vom Europa der Vaterländer mit einer „ Achse “ Paris - Berlin - Moskau , die sich während der Regierung Schröder bedrohlich abzeichnete .
Unversöhnliche Bekämpfung solcher und ähnlicher europäischer Strömungen .
Im Moment haben wir weltweit die absurde Situation , dass diejenigen , die mit dem bejubelten Siegeszug des Neoliberalismus die Krise erst herbeigeführt haben , diese nun mit denselben Mitteln beheben sollen
Wenn hier häufig der Begriff „ amerikanisch “ verwendet wird , so ist das zwangsläufig ungenau , denn eigentlich ist er nur ein Deckname für bestimmte Gruppeninteressen , die natürlich mit dem amerikanischen Volk und dessen Interessen überhaupt nichts gemein haben .
Daher sind Diskussionsthemen des CFR oder des American Council über vermeintlichen „ Antiamerikanismus “ nur sprachliche Verwirrspiele , in denen der Außenpolitik - Dino Henry Kissinger wie immer Meister ist : „ Globalisierung ist nur ein anderes Wort für US - Herrschaft “ 2 .
Ja und nein …
Kurz nach seiner Wahl in den Deutschen Bundestag und seine Berufung in den Auswärtigen Ausschuss ereilten Guttenberg noch zwei weitere Rufe : Er wird Mitglied in den Spitzenzirkeln des Aspen Instituts und der Atlantik - Brücke zu Berlin .

President Obama has ordered the closure of Guantanamo Bay The US is abandoning its use of the term " enemy combatants " to describe terror suspects - ending a key policy of the Bush administration .
It is the latest shift on Guantanamo Bay by President Barack Obama , who has announced the camp is to be closed .
The decision to drop the term is deeply symbolic , correspondents say .
President George W Bush argued that his status as commander - in - chief allowed him to hold " enemy combatants " indefinitely and without trial .
Announcing the end of the term 's use , the Justice Department said suspects would in future be held according to legal standards set by the international laws of war .
Under the new definition , only those who provided " substantial " support to al - Qaeda or the Taleban will be considered detainable , officials said .
' Values '
By using the term " enemy combatants " , the Bush administration argued that they were not prisoners of war , the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says .
International laws - like the Geneva Conventions - therefore did not automatically apply .
It is essential that we operate in a manner that strengthens our national security , is consistent with our values
Eric Holder
US Attorney General
Q&A : Closing Guantanamo
The Obama administration will , by contrast , hold prisoners under the authority granted by Congress , when it approved the Authorisation for the Use of Military Force " against nations , organizations , or persons the president determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the September 11 attacks , or harboured such organizations or persons " in September 2001 .
" The government 's new standard relies on the international laws of war to inform the scope of the president 's authority under this statute , " according to the Justice Department .
" As we work towards developing a new policy to govern detainees , it is essential that we operate in a manner that strengthens our national security , is consistent with our values , and is governed by law , " said US Attorney General Eric Holder in a statement .
Around 250 detainees are still being held in Guantanamo , our correspondent says .
The Obama administration is currently reviewing each case before making a decision as to who should stand trial , he adds .
Harsh techniques
The detention centre was set up in January 2002 by the Bush administration to hold men captured in the fight against al - Qaeda and the Taleban after the 2001 attacks on the US .
It later became notorious because of the harsh interrogation techniques used there , which many said amounted to torture , and because the detainees there were being held without trial and without many of the protections of international law .
During the presidential election , Mr Obama pledged to close the camp if elected , and in his first week in the White House , he issued the order to do so .
Some of the detainees are expected to stand trial in US courts , while others will be returned to their home countries .
But the Obama administration is likely to face difficulties prosecuting some inmates , because evidence against them may have been obtained using inadmissible techniques .
Other prisoners cannot be sent back to their home countries because they may face torture or execution if they return .
Mr Obama this week appointed diplomat Dan Fried to serve as a special envoy to persuade third countries to accept detainees who cannot be extradited to their home countries .

We 're entering commencement time , which means all kinds of notable people ( the President and First Lady included ) will be giving well - crafted speeches about the importance of education and a college degree .
But is one kind of degree better than another ?
Much has been said about the importance of science and technology degrees in terms of keeping the U.S. competitive with the rest of the world .
And as the economy has worsened , and fears of joblessness have risen , the voices advocating pursuit of more " practical " degrees have grown in both number and volume .
A recent New York Times article noted that Humanities now account for only 8 % of all college degrees , and that proponents are having to work harder than ever to justify the worth of a humanities , or liberal arts , course of study .
The article quotes Anthony T. Kronman , a Yale law professor , as saying , reluctantly , that the essence of a humanities education may become " a great luxury that many cannot afford . "
I passionately disagree .
( Full disclosure : I graduated from an Ivy League university with a liberal arts degree in Semiotics , which most people would consider a highly frivolous subject .
Although I have to say , the degree did turn out to be useful in getting me job interviews in all kinds of fields , simply because nobody knew what the word meant . )
However .
Three points worth considering in the debate :
First ... I figured out the true value of a college degree not in the lofty halls of Brown University , but in a corrugated cardboard factory in New Zealand .
I 'd taken a " leave of absence " as they call it , after my sophomore year , to figure out if I really wanted to pay all that money learn things that seemed , well ... a tad non-essential , at best .
I packed a backpack and took off for the romantic frontier - land of New Zealand with nothing but $ 500 and a working visa in my pocket .
The six months I spent there were a far cry from what I thought the adventure would be , but it was educational .
Culminating in my job at the cardboard factory -- where I was surrounded by people who hated their jobs but had no other viable option .
In a flash , I grasped the true value of a college degree .
It did n't matter what I majored in .
It did n't even matter all that much what my grades were .
What mattered was that I got that rectangular piece of paper that said , " Lane Wallace never has to work in a corrugated cardboard factory again . "
A piece of paper that was proof to any potential future employer that I could stick with a project and complete it successfully , even if parts of it were n't all that much fun .
A piece of paper that said I had learned how to process an overload of information , prioritize , sort through it intelligently , and distill all that into a coherent end product ... all while coping with stress and deadlines without imploding .
I also realized that I 'd do far better at all that if I studied what I was most passionate about learning , practicality be damned .
Hence my switch to Semiotics ( which , for anyone wondering , is a four - dollar word for communication ) .
If you want to be an engineer or physicist , you 'd better major in the subject .
But only if that 's what you truly want to study and do .
Pro forma dedication is discernible from 100 paces away .
Second ...
In an increasingly global economy and world , more than just technical skill is required .
Far more challenging is the ability to work with a multitude of viewpoints and cultures .
And the liberal arts are particularly good at teaching how different arguments on the same point can be equally valid , depending on what presumptions or values you bring to the subject .
The liberal arts canvas is painted not in reassuring black - and - white tones , but in maddening shades of gray .
What 's the " right " solution to the conflict in Sudan ?
What was Shakespeare 's most important work and why ?
Was John Locke right in his arguments about personal property ?
Get comfortable with the ambiguities inherent in a liberal arts education , and you 're far better equipped to face the ambiguities and differing viewpoints in a complex , global world .
( The late David Foster Wallace expanded on this point in his acclaimed 2005 Kenyon College commencement address , which , if you missed it at the time , is worth taking the time to read . )
Third ...
Yes , the U.S. needs technical expertise to keep pace , economically and technologically .
But we also need innovators and entrepreneurs creating break - through concepts and businesses .
And while knowledge in an area is important , I 'd argue that the most important trait a pioneering entrepreneur needs is the confidence to buck convention ; to believe he or she is right , despite what all the experts say .
The Atlantic , and in his book Free Flight Last year , I interviewed Alan Klapmeier , founder and CEO of the Cirrus Design Corporation , which revolutionized the piston - airplane manufacturing industry with its composite Cirrus aircraft ( discussed at length by James Fallows both here at , and in his book .
I asked Klapmeier what gave him the idea , back in the mid-1980s , that he could take on an industry as conservative and entrenched as general aviation .
His answer :
" I think it was my college education .
I went to Ripon College , which was a liberal arts school .
And that kind of school teaches you how to think for yourself .
My professors did n't tell you you were wrong .
They convinced you you were wrong .
And if they could n't , you might end up changing their minds on something .
Figuring out for yourself what right and wrong is builds a huge bit of confidence .
The kind that makes you think maybe we can take on an industry . "
Worth thinking about .
Scripps Networks , the parent company of The Food Network , has quietly launched a new website that might just be a " killer app " for online recipe search .
Currently in " beta , " Food.com sports a clean , almost zen design -- lots of white space , a bunch of carrots , a sprig of rosemary -- which stands in stark contrast to the brash style of its sibling site , the Food Network .
Food.com is a vertical search engine for recipes and an online repository for recipe collections .
Down the road , Scripps also plans to add social media tools to enable commentary and interaction between users .
Surprisingly , it 's not just a search engine for Scripps ' proprietary recipes on the Food Network website and Recipezaar ( which Scripps also owns ) .
Rather , Food.com searches all of the major recipe publishers on the web -- from epicurious to Food & Wine ( it presently skips over blogs ) .
Unlike these other sites , which search only within their own sites , Food.com 's search has no walls .
Aside from FoodieView , I believe it 's the only recipe search engine of its kind .
Using the Food.com website ( or a downloadable toolbar ) , you may select among sites such as epicurious , gourmet.com , Bon Appetit , CHOW , and other outlets , to search for recipes .
Enter search terms and Food.com will display the results from all of the sites in a single , scrollable list .
Recipe results and searches may also be filtered by variables such as the type of course , cuisine , main ingredient , technique , special diet , and cooking time .
Interestingly , Food.com does n't only list recipe titles from the other recipe sites .
It generates a thumbnail photo and -- here 's what 's unusual -- scrapes the entire ingredient lists as well ( see screenshot , right ) .
A link is provided for the user to go to the recipe owner 's site for the complete instructions .
While ingredient lists are generally understood to be copyright - free , and traffic will ultimately be directed to the recipe owners ' sites , this seems like a game - changer for recipe search , and I am very curious to see how the other publishers will respond .
Food.com also has a bookmarking feature which enables user 's to " add " recipes to your " recipe box " from other sites not included in the recipe search collection .
It 's a little clunky right now .
The function only works for those sites food.com has " white - listed " ( the developers told me more sites are being added all the time ) .
Moreover , by adding a recipe from one of these outside sites , Food.com currently only logs the URL and none of the rich information offered on a search of the major publishers .
So , is food .com a game changer ?
It would seem to eliminate the need to go around from site to site searching for recipes , and it also provides a single place to " store " recipes found online .
Moreover , scraping the ingredient lists allows for a time - saving way to skim through recipes and compare their complexity .
What do you think ?
Warehouse Workers Shut Down Walmart Warehouse in San Bernardino County
There is a growing movement of workers fighting for justice and good jobs in the warehouses of California 's Inland Empire .
On May 14th , they took the fight to America 's largest private employer : Walmart .
The Inland Empire has some of the highest rates of foreclosures and unemployment in the country , but the main industry of the area , warehousing for national retailers , is built on bad , low paying jobs .
Most of these jobs are through temp agencies and , in addition to low pay and no benefits these jobs do not allow workers to have any job security .
Jobs in the Inland Empire need to be good jobs with a living wage and affordable health care ; this is the best way the region has to pull itself out of the Great Recession .
On May 14th , warehouse workers , clergy , community members , and area students staged a nonviolent civil disobedience outside a Walmart warehouse in San Bernardino County .
The protest ended with the arrest of 7 people , including 4 clergy members , who had literally put their bodies on the line by blocking the truck entrance to the warehouse .
Over 200 people gathered in front of the Walmart warehouse , carrying signs with messages such as Warehouse Workers Want the Freedom to Form a Union .
They were protesting Walmarts vicious anti-worker and anti-union policies and highlighting the need for the Employee Free Choice Act .
Past attempt by workers at this warehouse to form a union were thwarted by managements harsh tactics of fear and intimidation .
The Valley Boulevard warehouse is completely dedicated to products destined for Southern California Walmart stores .
The facility serves Walmart stores and supplies a significant percent of non-food goods to Walmart stores in the region .
The facility operates 7 days a week , with three shifts running 24 hours a day .

Embedded Video Description : Workers Fighting Back : Warehouse Workers Take the Fight to Walmart
Somalia has experienced almost constant conflict since the collapse of its central government in 1991 .
It was hoped the election of moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad as president of a transitional government in January and the departure of Ethiopian troops would stop the violence , but Islamist insurgents are keeping up their almost daily attacks .
Who are the insurgents ?
The main fighters are from al - Shabab , a radical faction that emerged from the remnants of the Union of Islamic Courts , routed by the Ethiopian forces that invaded Somalia in 2006 .
AU 's MOGADISHU QUAGMIRE AU force in Somalia ( Amisom ) was mandated in January 2007 Supposed to be 8,000 - strong but currently has only 4,300 troops Comprised of soldiers from Uganda and Burundi Sierra Leone has offered battalion , which would take force over 5,000 Restricted by security situation to operations in Mogadishu
The group , which is on the US terror list and is said to have links with al - Qaeda , now controls much of southern and central Somalia and has imposed strict Sharia law in those areas .
They see President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , a former UIC leader , as having sold out for agreeing to head a government backed by the international community .
This view is shared by another group of Islamist fighters - Hisbul - Islam - formed after Mr Ahmed become president in January .
One of its main leaders is Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys , who together with Mr Ahmed headed the UIC in 2006 .
Unlike previous divisions in Somalia , these groups are not based on the clan system .
So what do they want ?
Power - so that Somalia is ruled by Sharia .
President Ahmed 's recent introduction of Islamic law has not appeased them .
They are followers of the Wahhabi school of Islam , which is based on a more rigid and literal interpretation of Islamic texts , rather than mainstream Sunni schools followed by most Somalis .
The Islamists also want the African Union peacekeepers , based in Mogadishu , to leave .
Mr Aweys , who recently returned from exile , says he will not enter peace talks with the government and his former ally until these " invaders " have gone .
Will the government survive ?
Not necessarily .
Military and intelligence sources say many government troops have defected to the insurgents .
One assessment reckons the government can only rely on some 4,000 fighters against 6,000 from al - Shabab .
Meanwhile , the AU peacekeepers , in the capital to bolster the government , do not have the mandate to pursue the insurgents .
Only 4,300 troops of a planned 8,000 strong force have deployed .
What is the international response ?
There is little appetite for international intervention given Ethiopia 's recent experience , which gave rise to the current insurgency .
Ethiopia initially intervened in late 2006 to save the interim government and to prevent the spread of fundamentalist Islam in Africa , a concern shared by America .
But they suffered daily attacks - and at the worst of the fighting the bodies of dead Ethiopian soldiers were dragged through Mogadishu , bringing to mind similar events when the US intervened in the 1990s - made famous by the film Black Hawk Down .
The UN backed the peace process which led to the election of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed as president .
In April , the international community pledged more than $ 200 m to Somalia to beef up its security .
Most of this is for the embattled AU to help them with equipment and the training of Somali forces .
They are intended to oversee the creation of 10,000 - strong police force and the training of 6,000 soldiers .
How are ordinary people coping ?
The latest fighting is said to have forced about 20,000 people from residential areas of the capital , where the battles are being played out by pro-government forces and insurgent groups .
And over the years hundreds of thousands of Somalis have fled to neighbouring countries .
More than one million people , in a nation the UN estimates to be of nine million , are internally displaced .
Drought is further exacerbating the situation , with more than one third of the population reliant on food aid .
Many Somalis depend for their survival on money sent home by their relatives abroad .

For decades , recording artists have lived in fear of their albums ending up in limbo if a record label refused to release it .
But no more ?
Danger Mouse , who broke into the public consciousness with his remarkable Grey Album remixing Jay - Z and The Beatles and went on to form Gnarls Barkley , is apparently counting on the fact that it 's the fans , not record labels like EMI , who have the upper hand in the digital age .
Danger Mouse has been working on a collection called " Dark Night of the Soul . "
Apparently , relations with EMI on the project have broken down , resulting in Danger Mouse issuing this statement :
Danger Mouse 's new project Dark Night Of The Soul consists of an album length piece of music by Danger Mouse , Sparklehorse and a host of guest vocalists , along with a collection of original David Lynch photography inspired by and based on the music .
The photographs , which provide a visual narrative for the music , are compiled in a limited edition , hand numbered 100 + page book which will now come with a blank , recordable CD -R .
All copies will be clearly labeled : " For Legal Reasons , enclosed CD - R contains no music .
Use it as you will . "
In other words , Danger Mouse is counting on fans getting the music elsewhere ( it leaked on P2P networks on May 7 and is currently available as an on - demand from NPR ) and burning it to the CD -R included with the book .
Some copyright lawyers may ask whether Danger Mouse is " inducing " copyright infringement by encouraging fans to make these unauthorized copies ( this assumes EMI owns the copyright in the sound recordings that make up " Dark Night of the Soul , " which would be typical in a major label deal ) .
Here 's where an interesting copyright law wrinkle might step in -- if the blank CD - R is a royalty - paid " music CD - R , " then the copies made by fans ( whether made from NPR or P2P ) would be legal under 17 U.S.C. 1008 , which provides that no infringement lawsuit may be " based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of [ a digital audio recording ] medium for making digital musical recordings . "
Digital audio recording medium ( DARM ) is defined to include " music CD - Rs " on which a royalty is paid to copyright owners .
All this just underscores what the digital world has been telling record labels for a decade : we do n't need you for distribution .
At least for Danger Mouse , the fans will be taking care of that themselves .
Staring up from the bottom of the deepest pipe in the world 's most ambitious plumbing operation , the view is that of a frog in a well : a small distant disc of sky .
Look again two years from now , and you would see a torrent of water apparently defying gravity as it surges up the 130 ft ( 39 m ) shaft first towards the heavens , then to Beijing and other thirsty cities .
The Guardian was the first foreign news organisation to enter the pits and tunnels at Jiaozuo in Henan province , which are at the centre of China 's latest , greatest engineering project , the South - North Water Diversion Scheme .
In the spirit of President Hu Jintao 's drive for " scientific development " , the aim is to engineer a solution to the most pressing environmental problem – the alarming depletion of water resources in the arid , heavily populated north .
More than twice as expensive as the Three Gorges Dam and three times longer than the railway to Tibet , the 50 - year , $ 62 bn ( £ 40.67bn ) project aims to channel a greater volume than the Thames along three channels – each more than 600 miles long – from the moist Yangtze basin up to the dry lands above the Yellow river .
At Jiaozuo , giant drills have already gouged out more than half of the 2.5 mile - long tunnel that will take the water under the Yellow river .
At the foot of the construction shaft , the nine - metre wide concrete pipe stretches into the dark far below the farm fields that stretch towards the river .
" This is a first in the history of the Yellow , " one of the engineers , Han Jiping , says proudly .
" There is nothing to compare . "
A project too far ?
The project has sparked so many ecological , financial and political concerns that government advisers are calling for the plan to be delayed and , possibly , curtailed , raising the possibility that this could prove a mega - project too far even for China .
First proposed in 1962 , the scheme was approved by Mao Zedong , who said it was fine for the south to " lend a little water " , but until recently the government has not had the money or technical ability to go ahead .
In the north , the disparity between supply and demand is evident across swaths of land that rely on the overworked and heavily polluted Yellow .
China 's second - biggest river accounts for 2 % of the country 's run-off , yet irrigates 15 % of the crops and supplies water to 140 million people , about 12 % of the population .
Xinhua news agency reported in 2008 that 4bn tonnes of industrial waste and sewage are discharged annually into the river system , leaving 83 % of the water too contaminated to drink without treatment .
Tang Xiyang , one of the founders of the green movement in China , is apocalyptic : " The Yellow river civilisation has been destroyed .
People cannot survive on that river any more . "
Yet the pressure on China 's " Mother River " grows as industrial parks and cities expand .
The accumulated overuse of water in Beijing , Tianjin and Hebei areas of northern China is estimated at 9bn cubic metres .
Water tables are falling and lakes evaporating .
Reducing demand has been difficult .
At the control centre of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission in Zhengzhou , water allocations are displayed on a wall - sized screen .
Nine provinces share the water .
Proportions have been fixed since 1987 based on an over - optimistic estimate that annual run-off is 58bn cubic metres .
This year , the volume is forecast to be less than 50bn cubic metres .
In 2003 , it fell below 45 bn .
Provinces are supposed to equally share the shortfall .
Yet Ningxia , Inner Mongolia and Shandong take more than 1bn cubic metres of water above allocation every year without permission .
The loser is the ecosystem .
Twenty - one billion cubic metres are set aside for sediment flushing and maintenance of non-human life on the river .
This is the area of the water budget that is raided when provinces go over their limit .
Research shows the value of keeping water for nature , but officials say they need more power to achieve this .
' Digital Yellow river '
" Some provinces and reservoirs do n't obey our instructions .
They ignore us to generate electricity , " says Yu . " It 's a problem .
We lack punitive measures . "
The commission has reduced flooding and sedimentation and says pollution has peaked in several areas .
But regulation of demand remains a challenge .
Central government is drafting a Yellow river law that will give more power to the river 's administrators .
There are plans for a " digital Yellow river " scheme for officials in Zhengzhou to remotely control and monitor sluice gates and ­irrigation channels along the river – today only possible in the lower reaches .
This demand - side solution faces fierce opposition .
No province wants a cut in water supplies when they all want to boost industry and agriculture .
The latter is the biggest drain on the river , accounting for 90 % of diverted water .
Yu and his colleagues are dispatched to sluice gates during times of drought .
" It can be very dangerous , " he says .
" In the past , our engineers have been thrown into the river by angry residents .
In the early days after 1999 , nobody wanted to accept us .
Upstream residents did n't care about lowstream demands .
They said that historically , they could always take what they wanted . "
Faced by such obstacles in reducing demand , the government is pressing ahead with measures to increase supply .
Its primary response is the diversion scheme , approved by Hu Jintao – a hydro - engineering graduate – in 2002 .
A year after the first leg was supposed to be complete , all three routes have hit snags .
The eastern leg , along the Grand canal , was supposed to be easiest to finish , but pollution in this heavily industrialised region is so great that water treatment is prohibitively expensive .
Tianjin reportedly prefers to build desalination plants .
The western leg has been suspended over concerns about the political and economic cost of diverting water from the Yangtze to the Yellow , high on the Tibet - Qinghai plateau .
The central route also faces delays over environmental and compensation concerns .
About 300,000 people will have to be relocated and swaths of farmland cleared .
At Jiaozuo , a 40 - minute drive north of Zhengzhou , engineers from the 16th Bureau of the China Railway Construction Group are digging a 130 ft - wide channel through the red earth .
Once completed , it will take 9.5bn cubic metres of water from the Han river , which feeds the Yangtze , to Beijing – but it will leave problems at its source .
Du Yun , a geologist at the China Academy of Sciences , has warned that the diversion of a third of the water in the Danjiangkou reservoir will raise the risk of pollution , sedimentation and flooding on the Han river .
To offset these fears , the government has earmarked an extra 8 bn yuan ( £ 760 m ) to bolster the Han , including diverting water from the Three Gorges reservoir on the Yangtze and along the Xinglong Hinge .
These measures – essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul – will require at least 400 miles of channels to be dug through farmland .
Many people in Hubei feel they are still losing out .
Solar and wind options
" We are appealing for the government to increase the compensation fund for Han river projects and to build more sewage plants , " said Shen Xiaoli , of the Research Academy of Environmental Science in Hubei .
" Once a construction project starts upstream , it requires water compensation downstream .
This , in turn , necessitates other projects to deal with the negative impacts .
It 's a circle in which you need ever more solutions and ever more funds . "
Most of the grumbles are coming from the middle reaches of the Hanby the diversion scheme .
" Local people are very worried about the impact on our ecology because we will lose a fifth of our water , " said a resident of Xiangfan City , who asked to remain anonymous .
" Although we are concerned , everyone must express support .
We dare not oppose the central government . "
Yet , this is only the first of three - planned phases of construction on the east and central legs .
The government has been advised to wait and see the results before proceeding further .
" The original plans were made 20 years ago .
Since then our society has developed and the natural environment has changed .
My view is that we must make a new assessment of the plan for the middle and eastern legs , " a senior government adviser said .
" Then we should decide whether we need changes , whether we should go ahead with the second and third stages . "
The comments are part of a debate about the wisdom of nature - conquering mega-projects .
The new scientific development aims at sustainability , at quality rather than quantity .
A new generation of academics and policymakers has started to question the " big is beautiful " approach of the past .
" I am not a supporter of mega - projects , " said Zuo Qiting , a professor of hydrology at Zhengzhou University .
" One way to halt the trend of ever - bigger projects is to evaluate their impact from a wider perspective .
We need to look not just locally , but at the national and global level . "
International environmental groups say the focus should be on reducing demand rather than boosting supply .
" Transferring water from the Yangtze tributaries to the thirsty plains of northern China may well lead to environmental collapse of the Han river , the Three Gorges reservoir , and the Yangtze delta , " said Peter Bosshard of International Rivers .
" To resolve its water crisis , China needs to phase out thirsty industries and agricultural crops in the drought - prone north and replace them with more environmentally sound practices . "
According to recent surveys , somewhere between 79 and 92 percent of Americans believe in God .
But if the responses to my column on Terry Eagleton ’s “ Faith , Reason and Revolution ” constitute a representative sample , 95 percent of Times readers do n’t .
What they do believe , apparently , is that religion is a fairy tale , hogwash , balderdash , nonsense and a device for rationalizing horrible deeds .
Of course , there is more than name - calling to their antitheism ; there are arguments , and the one most often made insists on a sharp distinction between religion and science , or , alternatively , between faith and reason .
The assertion , generally , is that while “ science is based on observation , religion is based on opinion ” ( RM Paxton )
Or , in another formulation , science does not involve belief , it is “ based on common observation ” ( Dave Goldenberg ) .
Science “ simply reports facts ” ( Bob W. )
Or , in the same vein , “ Science helps us to understand the world as it is ” ( Mark Grein ) .
In short , while science provides a window on the world , religion places between us and the world a fog of doctrine and superstition , and if we want to become clear - eyed , we have to dispel ( a word that should be taken literally ) that fog .
This is the promise offered by Christopher Hitchens , who tells his readers ( in “ God is Not Great ” ) , “ You will feel better . . . once you leave hold of the doctrinaire and allow your chainless mind to do its own thinking . ”
( Thinkers of the world , unite ; you have nothing to lose but your chains . )
Sounds good , sounds simple .
Just free the mind of pre-packaged beliefs and take a good look at things .
But is it that easy ?
Is observation a matter simply of opening up your baby blues and taking note of the evidence that presents itself ?
Does evidence come labeled as such – “ I am evidence for thesis X but not Y ” ?
When Tony Eads declares that “ the overwhelming weight of the evidence fails to provide any ground for believing there is a God , ” is the evidence he refers to ( he does n’t actually present any ) just lying around waiting to be cited as independent confirmation or disconfirmation of an equally independent thesis ?
I do n’t think that ’s the way it happens or could happen .
Let ’s say ( to give a humble example from literary studies ) that there is a dispute about the authorship of a poem .
A party to the dispute might perform comparative analyses of the writings of rival candidates , examine letters and personal libraries , research the records of printers and publishers , look at the history of reception , etc .
Everyone who engages in the dispute will do his or her work in relation to well - established notions of what counts as evidence for authorship and accepted criteria for determining whether or not the evidence marshaled is persuasive .
But suppose , you think ( in the manner of Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault ) that the idea of the individual author is a myth that emerges alongside the valorization of property and property rights so central to Enlightenment thought ?
Suppose you believe that the so - called author is not the source of the words to which he signs his name , but is instead merely a site transversed by meanings neither he nor any other so - called “ individual ” originates ?
( “ Writing , ” says Barthes , “ is the destruction of every voice , of every point of origin . ” )
I am not affirming this view , which has religious ( “ not me , but my master in me ” ) and secular ( it is the age or zeitgeist that speaks ) versions .
I am just observing that there are many who hold it , and that for those who do the evidence provided by printers ’ records or letters or library holdings will not be evidence at all ; for they do not believe in the existence of the entity — the conclusively identified individual author — it aspires to be evidence of .
If no one wrote the poem in the sense assumed by the effort to fix authorship , that effort is without a point and the adducing of evidence in the absence of something to be proved will seem quixotic and even perverse .
The example might seem to be to the side of the ( supposed ) tension between faith and reason , but it is , I believe , generalizable .
Evidence , understood as something that can be pointed to , is never an independent feature of the world .
Rather , evidence comes into view ( or does n’t ) in the light of assumptions – there are authors or there are n’t — that produce the field of inquiry in the context of which ( and only in the context of which ) something can appear as evidence .
To bring all this abstraction back to the arguments made by my readers , there is no such thing as “ common observation ” or simply reporting the facts .
To be sure , there is observation and observation can indeed serve to support or challenge hypotheses .
But the act of observing can itself only take place within hypotheses ( about the way the world is ) that cannot be observation ’s objects because it is within them that observation and reasoning occur .
While those hypotheses are powerfully shaping of what can be seen , they themselves cannot be seen as long as we are operating within them ; and if they do become visible and available for noticing , it will be because other hypotheses have slipped into their place and are now shaping perception , as it were , behind the curtain .
By the same analysis , simple reporting is never simple and common observation is an achievement of history and tradition , not the result of just having eyes .
And while there surely are facts , there are no facts ( at least not ones we as human beings have access to ) that simply declare themselves to the chainless minds
Hitchens promises us if we will only cast aside the blinders of religion .
Indeed , there are no chainless minds , and it ’s a good thing , too .
A chainless mind would be a mind not hostage to or fettered by any pre-conceptions , a mind that was free to go its own way .
But how could you go any way if you are not anywhere , if you are not planted in some restricted location in relation to which the directions “ here , ” “ there ” and “ elsewhere ” have a sense ?
A mind without chains – a better word would be “ constraints ” – would be free and open in a way that made motivated ( as opposed to random ) movement impossible .
Thought itself — the consideration of problems with a view to arriving at their solutions — requires chains , requires stipulated definitions , requires limits it did not choose but which enable and structure its operations .
MB asks ,
“ Why is it not possible to reason simply as a gratuitous exercise . ”
Why , in other words , is it not possible to reason without anything in mind ?
Just try it ; you ca n’t even imagine what it would be like .
If there is no thought without constraints ( chains ) and if the constraints cannot be the object of thought because they mark out the space in which thought will go on , what is noticed and perspicuous will always be a function of what cannot be noticed because it can not be seen .
The theological formulation of this insight is well known : Faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen ( Hebrews 11 ) .
Once the act of simply reporting or simply observing is exposed as a fiction — as something that just ca n’t be done — the facile opposition between faith - thinking and thinking grounded in independent evidence cannot be maintained .
Pking gets it right .
“ To torpedo faith is to destroy the roots of . . . any system of knowledge . . .
I challenge anyone to construct an argument proving reason ’s legitimacy without presupposing it . . .
Faith is the base , completely unavoidable .
Get used to it .
It ’s the human condition . ”
( All of us , not just believers , see through a glass darkly . )
Religious thought may be vulnerable on any number of fronts , but it is not vulnerable to the criticism that in contrast to scientific or empirical thought , it rests on mere faith .
Some readers find a point of vulnerability in what they take to be religion ’s flaccid , Polyanna - like , happy - days optimism .
Religious people , says Delphinias , live their lives “ in a state of blissfully blind oblivion . ”
They rely on holy texts that they are “ to believe in without question . ” ( C.C. )
“ No evidence , no problem — just take it on faith . ” ( Michael )
They do n’t allow themselves to be bothered by anything .
Religion , says Charles , “ cannot deal with doubt and dissent , ” and he adds this challenge : “ What say you about that , Professor ? ”
What I say , and I say it to all those quoted in the previous paragraph , is what religion are you talking about ?
The religions I know are about nothing but doubt and dissent , and the struggles of faith , the dark night of the soul , feelings of unworthiness , serial backsliding , the abyss of despair .
Whether it is the book of Job , the Confessions of St. Augustine , Calvin ’s Institutes , Bunyan ’s “ Grace Abounding to The Chief of Sinners , ” Kierkegaard ’s “ Fear and Trembling ” and a thousand other texts , the religious life is depicted as one of aspiration within the conviction of frailty .
The heart of that life , as Eagleton reminds us , is not a set of propositions about the world ( although there is some of that ) , but an orientation toward perfection by a being that is radically imperfect .
The key event in that life is not the fashioning of some proof of God ’s existence but a conversion , like St. Paul ’s on the road to Damascus , in which the scales fall from one ’s eyes , everything visible becomes a sign of God ’s love , and a new man ( or woman ) , eager to tell and live out the good news , is born .
“ To experience personal transformation that in turn can truly move and shake this world , we must believe in something outside of ourselves ” ( Judith Quinton ) .
” The kind of religion that moves me , ” says Shannon . . . is the story of hope and love . . . not the idea that any particular story describes concrete historical ‘ truth . ’ ”
“ It is n’t about moral superiority , ” says Richard .
“ It ’s about humbly living an examined life held up to the mirror of a higher truth .
It certainly does not seem to be about comfort . ”
So to sum up , the epistemological critique of religion — it is an inferior way of knowing — is the flip side of a naïve and untenable positivism .
And the critique of religion ’s content — it ’s cotton - candy fluff — is the product of incredible ignorance .
One more thing .
A number of readers chided Eagleton and me for daring to enter the lists against the superior intellects of Hitchens and Richard Dawkins .
E.R .
Wood predicts that “ if Fish debated Dawkins , Fish would lose by KO in every round . ”
It would be hard to reply to that without seeming either defensive or boastful , so I ’m happy to leave it to someone else .
I refer you to a piece by syndicated columnist Paul Campos , which begins by asking , “ Why is Stanley Fish so much smarter than Richard Dawkins ? ” Darned if I know .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : hmatrix - static : statically - sized linear algebra
Hi everyone , I am pleased to announce hmatrix - static [ 1 ] , a thin wrapper over Alberto Ruiz 's excellent hmatrix library [ 2 ] for linear algebra .
The main additions of hmatrix - static over hmatrix are : - vectors and matrices have their length encoded in their types - vectors and matrices may be constructed and destructed using view patterns , affording a clean , safe syntax .
hmatrix - static includes statically - sized versions of hmatrix 's linear algebra routines , including : - simple arithmetic ( addition , multiplication , of matrices and vectors ) - matrix inversion and least squares solutions - determinants / rank / condition number - computing eigensystems - factorisations : svd , qr , cholesky , hessenberg , schur , lu - exponents and sqrts of matrices - norms See http://code.haskell.org/hmatrix-static/examples/ for example code .
Installation and requirements :
Because of the use of type families and view patterns , hmatrix - static requires GHC 6.10 to build .
The linear algebra routines are ultimately implemented by BLAS , GSL and LAPACK ; see the hmatrix manual [ 3 ] for instructions on installing these , prior to installing hmatrix .
Once this has been done , hmatrix - static can be installed by $ cabal install hmatrix - static I would be very interested in your feedback , so please try it out .
Kind regards , Reiner Pope [ 1 ]

Citing documents , interviews and megamedia reports , this article discusses " harrowing details " of the " torture inside and outside Guantánamo " as uncovered by the Spanish investigation :
Among them : " blows to [ the ] testicles ; " " detention underground in total darkness for three weeks with deprivation of food and sleep ; " being " inoculated ... through injection with ' a disease for dog cysts ; ' " the smearing of feces on prisoners ; and waterboarding .
A March 2005 memo written by a lawyer who visited prisoner Omar Deghayes at Guantánamo describes torture of threatening to leave Deghayes in a room with large snakes that were shown to him and recounted how Deghayes witnessed one prisoner sodomized at Bagram :
" One day they took me to a room that had very large snakes in glass boxes .
The room was all painted black - and - white , with dim lights .
They threatened to leave me there and let the snakes out with me in the room .
This really got to me , as there were such sick people that they must have had this room specially made . " ... Deghayes was eventually moved to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan , where he was beaten and " kept nude , as part of the process of humiliation due to his religion . "
U.S. personnel placed Deghayes " inside a closed box with a lock and limited air . "
He also described seeing U.S. guards sodomize an African prisoner and alleged guards " forced petrol and benzene up the anuses of the prisoners . "
The memo includes more accounts of Deghayes ’ torture , including smearing the feces of another prisoner onto his face , beatings by a knee to his nose , forcing water up his nose with a high pressure hose until he was suffocating and forcing pepper spray into his eyes and pushing a finger into his eye .
A medical examination cited in the Spanish investigation confirmed that Deghayes suffered from blindness of the right eye , fracture of the nasal bone and fracture of the right index finger , as well as post - traumatic stress disorder and " profound " depression .
The articles also discusses how the Spanish investigation may " for the first time place an intense focus on a notorious , but seldom discussed , thug squad deployed by the U.S. military to retaliate with excessive violence to the slightest resistance by prisoners at Guantánamo . "
The Immediate Reaction Force ( IRF ) teams are called the " Black Shirts of Guantánamo " by human rights lawyers representing prisoners .
Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller , the " man credited with eventually " Gitmoizing " Abu Ghraib and other U.S. - run prisons " , issued a Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta at Guantánamo in 2003 .
The IRF teams , on paper , are supposed to be emergency response teams of 5 military police officers used as a " forced - extraction team " to extract a prisoner from a cell who is combative or resistant .
The team members are " dressed in full riot gear " that prisoners and their attorneys describe as " Darth Vader " suits and " each officer is assigned a body part of the prisoner to restrain : head , right arm , left arm , left leg , right leg . "
However , in reality , according to prisoners and lawyers , the IRFs can not be separated from the torture .
The " ' Black Shirts ' of Guantanamo routinely terrorize prisoners , breaking bones , gouging eyes , squeezing testicles , and ' dousing ' them with chemicals . "
While much of the " torture debate " has emphasized the so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques " defined by the twisted legal framework of the Office of Legal Council memos , IRF teams in effect operate at Guantánamo as an extrajudicial terror squad that has regularly brutalized prisoners outside of the interrogation room , gang beating them , forcing their heads into toilets , breaking bones , gouging their eyes , squeezing their testicles , urinating on a prisoner 's head , banging their heads on concrete floors and hog-tying them -- sometimes leaving prisoners tied in excruciating positions for hours on end .
According to General Miller ’s SOP memo , all of the actions of the IRF teams should be videotaped .
In 2005 , there were " reportedly 500 hours of video ; the ACLU attempted to force their release , but they never have been produced . "
A former IRF member stated that cameras were present for IRFing , but usually the camera was not turned on or was pointed at the ground .
However , one lawyer , Stafford Smith , who also represents Binyam Mohamed , says that he can " confirm that there is photographic evidence . "
A US soldier , Sgt. Sean Baker , was ordered to participate in IRF training drill in January 2003 as an uncooperative prisoner .
However , IRF members believed that he was a real prisoner .
Sgt. Baker described the IRF physical assault :
They grabbed my arms , my legs , twisted me up and , unfortunately , one of the individuals got up on my back from behind and put pressure down on me while I was face down .
Then he -- the same individual -- reached around and began to choke me and press my head down against the steel floor .
After several seconds , 20 to 30 seconds , it seemed like an eternity because I could n't breathe .
When I could n't breathe , I began to panic and I gave the code word I was supposed to give to stop the exercise , which was ' red . ' ...
That individual slammed my head against the floor and continued to choke me .
Somehow I got enough air .
I muttered out : ' I 'm a U.S. soldier .
I 'm a U.S. soldier . '
Sgt. Baker said his head was slammed once more , and after groaning " I'm a U.S. soldier " one more time , " I heard them say , ' Whoa , whoa , whoa , ' you know , like ... he was telling the other guy to stop . "
CBS and the New York Times later reported that while all such drills are routinely videotaped , the military can not find the tape .
" Baker was soon diagnosed with traumatic brain injury .
He began suffering seizures , sometimes 10 to 12 per day . "
In April of this year , a 21 - year - old Guantánamo prisoner called Al - Jazeera and described in an interview a recent IRF assault of beatings and tear gas .
A new supercomputer with the power of 50,000 home PCs - the fastest in Europe and the third worldwide - has been unveiled in Germany .
The " Jugene " , capable of 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second , ranks behind the " Roadrunner " and " Jaguar " computers in the United States , said Kosta Schinarakis from the Juelich research centre , where the computer is located .
Jugene will be used for a wide variety of operations , including research on fuel cells for electric cars , weather forecasting and the origins of the universe , the centre said .
Apple has rejected an iPhone app that would enable users to fashion their mugs into portraits resembling Jesus Christ .
The app , called Me So Holy , involves using the iPhone 's camera to snap a mug shot of someone , which can then be scaled and cropped to replace Jesus ' face .
Apple rejected the app , saying it " contains objectionable material , " according to Me So Holy developer Benjamin Kahle .
" Applications must not contain any obscene , pornographic , offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , etc. ) , or other content or materials that in Apple ’s reasonable judgement may be found objectionable by iPhone or iPod touch users , ” the iPhone SDK agreement states .
Apple may be tightening its restrictions on its iPhone App Store after it approved an iPhone app called Baby Shaker , a game whose objective was to shake a baby to death .
Amid parental outrage , Apple subsequently removed the app , saying its approval was a mistake .
Though tremendously successful , Apple 's iPhone App Store has been the victim of heavy scrutiny .
Other than being criticized for approving questionable apps such as Baby Shaker , some developers have slammed Apple for being unclear about its App Store approval process .
For example , FreedomVoice Systems in March told Wired.com that Apple had n't said a word about its iPhone voice app Newber for six months , potentially costing the company $ 600,000 in wasted investments .
In defense of Me So Holy , Kahle questioned what was objectionable about his app , since it did not contain any violence or offensive content .
" We feel that Apple is being too sensitive to its perceived user group and are disappointed that this otherwise creative , freethinking company would reject such a positive and fun application , " Kahle wrote in his blog .
" The message to developers is that they should think inside the box , rather than outside it . "
Nonetheless , the App Store continues to lure developers with dreams of striking it rich .
One of the largest success stories to date involves Ethan Nicholas , an independent developer whose iPhone game iShoot earned him $ 600,000 in a single month .

The movie studios have described RealDVD as " StealDVD " Hollywood has locked horns with the technology industry over who will control digital entertainment and how it is watched .
The six big film studios say a program called RealDVD violates copyright .
This week a San Francisco court could decide if DVD users can make personal backups the way people do with audio .
" The consumer should have the same fair use rights to copy DVDs just as they have for the last decade with music , " said Bill Hankes of RealDVD .
RealDVD , which is made by RealNetworks , allows DVD owners to make digital copies of their discs onto a computer or laptop hard drive for their own personal use without having to pay extra .
Downloadable versions of many movies are available online , and some studios let users make a digital copy of a movie onto a computer by paying more for an " expanded edition " of a DVD .
Many believe this means the consumer is being made to pay twice .
Kevin
Hunt who writes the Electronic Jungle column for the Baltimore Sun said : " For 11 years , since the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) made it illegal to bypass any digital rights management protection system , the movie and music industries have fought a war ostensibly against piracy .
" In reality , it has been a war against the consumer , designed to make people pay more than once for the same song or album or movie . "
' Steal DVD '
At the heart of the case the movie studios , represented by the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) , claim that RealDVD is illegal under the DMCA .
Figures show the DVD market in the US was worth almost $ 22bn in 2008 The Association said the software bypasses the copy protection built into DVDs meaning that users could copy a DVD and share it around .
The studios have described the product as " Steal DVD . "
The real fear being expressed is that the technology would enable people to " rent , rip , and return " DVDs .
These are the terms used to describe someone who rents a DVD , copies the content onto a hard drive and returns the movie without ever paying for the unauthorised copy .
" Our objective is to get the illegal choices out of the marketplace and instead focus constructively with the technology community on bringing in more innovative and flexible legal options for consumers to enjoy movies , " Greg Goeckner , executive vice president and general counsel , MPAA told the BBC in an e-mail statement .
RealNetworks , which makes RealDVD , claimed that in actual fact the company has enhanced the security of the product .
" We have added an extra layer of security encryption , the same the government uses , to ensure piracy is not a possibility , " said RealDVD spokesman Mr Hankes .
A digital version made using RealDVD can only be played on the computer that made the copy .
The DVD Copy Control Association , which is primarily responsible for the copy protection of DVDs and also suing RealNetworks , told the BBC it would not comment until the case is resolved .
" Tension " RealDVDs '
Mr Hankes said he had not been surprised by Hollywood 's reaction to the product .
" There has been a tension between Silicon Valley and Hollywood for a long time and this is another example of that .
The MPAA said the cost of movie piracy is the industry 's biggest threat " It is not uncommon for content owners to be initially concerned about the manner in which their content will be treated by new technology .
That is why we went to talk to the studios before we released the product , " said Mr Hankes .
The National Consumers League , a 100 - year - old consumer watchdog group , said a survey it conducted in conjunction with RealNetworks showed consumers want choice .
" The entertainment industry would be wise to pay attention to the attitudes and purchase desire of the typical American consumer , who , according to our survey , is very interested in being able to back up his or her collection , " said executive director Sally Greenberg .
To some extent the genie is already out of the bottle because there are a number of illegal ways to do what ReadDVD does .
" Consumer behaviour is going to continue regardless of what happens in this court case .
The question is can Hollywood and technology get out in front of it so the consumer adopts legitimate behaviour , " said Mr Hankes .
Fred Von Lohmann , a senior lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation suggested the picture is not so black and white .
" Hollywood says that without encryption , the DVD market would collapse .
I say , the pirates have already won , the software to copy is free and you 're still selling DVDs . "
" The sky has not fallen , " added Mr Von Lohmann .
The case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California is being heard by Judge Marilyn Patel .
She presided over the Napster case and eventually shut down the original peer - to - peer music file - sharing service .
The hearing , which will resume on Thursday , is expected to end this week with closing arguments this Friday or the following week .
Most people expect Judge Patel to deliver her decision in a written ruling in the coming weeks .

Subject Introducing SELinux sandbox , confining untrusted binaries From Eric Paris <> Date Tue , 26 May 2009 12:54:03 - 0400 Dan and I ( mostly Dan ) have started to play with using SELinux to
confine random untrusted binaries .
The program is called ' sandbox . '
http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/28545.html
The idea is to allow administrators to lock down tightly untrusted
applications in a sandbox where they can not use the network and
open / create any file that is not handed to the process .
Can be used to
protect a system while allowing it to run some untrusted binary .
A quick dirty example of this sandbox would be to confine the ' cut '
binary .
If I wanted to create a file of users on my system from
the /etc / passwd file , I could try
> sandbox cut -d : -f1 /etc / passwd >
/tmp/users
/ bin/cut : /etc / passwd : Permission denied
Which shows the sandbox domain is not allowed to open / etc / passwd
But I can execute
> cat /etc / passwd | sandbox cut -d : - f1 > /tmp/users
And it works just fine .
Inside the sandbox cut was n't allowed to get to /etc / passwd .
But in the
second example since /etc / passwd was opened by the shell and handed to
cut inside the sandbox it works .
I 'd love to hear feedback , suggestions , problems , enhancements ,
thoughts , complaints , things of that nature !
Check it out , SELinux confinement made easy .

Bill Gates probably will not sing the praises of Keith Curtis , a programmer with Microsoft for 11 years who 's now left the fold and written a book about why the Redmond way will fail .
Oh yeah , Curtis is not afraid to speak his mind as a Linux guru , either .
The mantra Curtis repeats throughout his book " After the Software Wars " : proprietary software is holding us back as a society .
In the book , Curtis says that while proprietary software made Microsoft one of the most successful companies of all time , it 's a model destined to fail because it does n't let software programmers cooperate and contribute , and thus stifles innovation .
Curtis did programming work on Windows , Office and research at Microsoft and never actually used Linux , he says , until he quit his job in late 2004 .
The ensuing years have made him a Linux fanatic , and he is convinced that free , open - source software is technically superior .
As long as Microsoft and its proprietary model dominate , Curtis says , we will live in " the dark ages of computing . "
" If Microsoft , 20 years ago , built Windows in an open way , Linux would n't exist , and millions of programmers would be improving Windows rather than competing with it . "
Keith Curtis
In an interview with CIO.com 's Shane O'Neill , Curtis discusses the rise of free software , Linux 's role in what he calls the inevitable fall of software 's biggest giant and ... robot - driven cars .
In what ways will free software be Microsoft 's undoing ?
Free software will lead to the demise of Microsoft as we know it in two ways .
First , the free software community is producing technically superior products through an open , collaborative development model .
People think of Wikipedia as an encyclopedia , and not primarily software , but it is an excellent case study of this coming revolution .
There are also many pieces of free software that have demonstrated technical superiority to their proprietary counterparts .
Firefox is widely regarded by Web developers as superior to Internet Explorer .
The Linux kernel runs everything from cellphones to supercomputers .
Even Apple threw away their proprietary kernel and replaced it with a free one .
Second , free software undermines Microsoft 's profit margins .
Even if Microsoft were to adopt Linux — a thought experiment I consider in the afterword of my book — their current business model would be threatened .
There are many ways for hardware and service companies to make money using free software , but these are not Microsoft 's sources of revenues .
Free products like Linux and Google Docs currently comprise only a tiny proportion of their respective markets compared to Microsoft .
What will it take for free software to truly catch on with consumers and businesses as you predict it will ?
And how long will that take ?
Linux and other free software are already doing well in markets other than the desktop .
Google has hundreds of thousands of machines running Linux .
Free software is well on its way to conquering the small and the large , and the remaining challenge is the desktop in the middle .
The desktop is a particularly hard problem , but Linux is very close and is advancing at a fast pace .
The move to the Web has also undermined Microsoft 's position , as the most popular application on a computer is a Web browser , and Firefox ably meets those needs .
The second most popular usage is for productivity applications , and while OpenOffice still needs some work , it is good enough for perhaps 99 percent of users .
I worked on text engines for five years at Microsoft and wrote my book using OpenOffice .
" Even if Microsoft did embrace Linux , not only would it hurt their profit margins , they'd be forced to explain to customers why they should continue to pay for Office . "
Keith Curtis
I do n't know when Linux will become 10 percent or 25 percent of the desktop market .
Some said Linux would take over 10 years ago , and while that was premature , it is close now .
Part of my book is a message to the computer industry discussing the remaining challenges .
Google Docs , and the question of whether all apps will move to the Web , is a raging debate .
But Linux can succeed without such a transformation .
I think that while the Web is great for simple applications , it is very limited .
I think Google Docs is an example of a bridge too far .
You mention the bugs in Windows Vista as evidence of the limitations of proprietary software .
How could Microsoft improve Windows ?
If Microsoft , 20 years ago , built Windows in an open way , Linux would n't exist , and millions of programmers would be improving it rather than competing with it .
However , I think it is too late for that now .
For example , if Microsoft were to release the source code to Internet Explorer , no one would care because Firefox and WebKit ( the basis of Apple 's Safari ) already exist .
Microsoft is manning a leaky ship , and the only thing they can do is just try to pump water faster .
It appears that Windows 7 plugs many of the leaks in Vista , but it is still fundamentally flawed .
The biggest difference between Windows and Linux is that free software contains thousands of applications , installable with one click , and managed as one set .
A Linux operating system includes all the obvious stuff like a spreadsheet , Web browser and instant messaging .
But it also includes tools for making pictures and music , server software and development tools .
Linux changes how people think about their computer .
Microsoft has no response for this .
In addition , proprietary software hurts Microsoft .
Google writes mostly proprietary software , but quietly leverages a lot of free software that is a key to its success .
What can Microsoft do to curb the threat of free software , and what do you think it will be willing to do ?
Other than adopting Linux , there is little Microsoft can do .
Even if they did embrace it , not only would it hurt their profit margins , they'd be forced to explain to customers why they should continue to pay for Office if the company believes the free OpenOffice is good enough .
Microsoft has created Web sites where developers can use free code and collaborate , and the latest is called CodePlex .
While it shows that Microsoft understands the benefits of free software , this site mostly contains tiny add - ons to proprietary Microsoft products .
Microsoft has also released some software it wrote under various open licenses .
While it is good PR for Microsoft , this software is being absorbed by the outside community .
This does n't actually curb the threat ; it increases it .
So I do n't really know what Microsoft can do .
While the company says it does n't like piracy , it does allow itself to compete on price with free software .
As Bill Gates wrote : " It 's easier for our software to compete with Linux when there 's piracy than when there 's not . "
Other than operating systems and application development , how is proprietary software impeding progress in the world ?
Faster progress in artificial intelligence is one of the most interesting benefits we 'll receive from free software .
We could have had thinking machines and cars that drive us around years ago if we had our AI researchers all over the world working together .
It will also improve our understanding of biology .
I went to a human genomics conference and found it was filled with proprietary software .
I think many companies in this field have adopted the Microsoft model , thinking it was how people should build software .
In my book , I talk about how free software will play a key part in the 21st century renaissance .

The nature of man being what it is , the desire for fun and leisure is limitless .
After a hard week of working and saving , Friday night is enough reason to open the barn door for music and celebration .
Farmer Bob woke Monday to face another week of reaping that which he had sown .
He knows the routine : out to the fields in the morning for a long day of labor .
Each evening , he returns to his barn and tosses the day 's bales of hay , one after the other , onto an ever - growing pile in the back .
Bob recognizes that he has to store - to save - this hay so that he has something to exchange at the Saturday farmers market throughout the year .
In addition , he recognizes that he has to set aside some bales to feed his animals next week and throughout the long , cold winter .
After completing this task , Bob locks the barn door and drags his exhausted body toward home and kitchen .
During the season , his routine is usually the same .
But this week had a little twist .
Unbeknownst to Bob , his wife invited her Uncle Sam to visit .
Now , Uncle Sam is a real layabout .
Sure , he is fun , always ready for a hearty laugh , yet he never works a job .
At family reunions and get - togethers , Uncle Sam alludes to " all that money my wife left me . "
But folks who knew his wife never heard of any family wealth or riches .
For the price of meals and a bed , Uncle Sam entertains relatives for a week at a time , moving from house to house , and city of city , arranging events that become the talk for years .
Now it was Bob 's turn to host the party .
Yet , somehow , Bob sensed he drew the short straw .
Given the challenges of running a business , Bob relies on his entrepreneurial calculations to keep his family fed and the finances of his farm in order .
So , throughout his work week , Bob mentally tallies bales of hay .
There are the 100 he unloads into the barn each evening - his nominal savings .
And then there are the five bales that succumb to pests and mold during the week .
So , working five days per week , Bob has an effective savings of 495 bales per week - the 500 reaped less the 5 lost .
At the end of each week , Bob splits his weekly product between the 50 bales for next week 's feed , the 300 he sets aside as long - term savings - for exchange and feed throughout the winter , and the remaining 145 he exchanges for current goods , services , loans , etc .
As the season is 10 weeks old , Bob has already stored 3,000 bales in the barn - a great savings to be sure .
At the start of the week , Bob had confidence in his future .
But he soon experienced a nagging concern over that layabout planning the Friday shindig .
Each day , Bob labored while Uncle Sam relaxed on the porch , iced tea in one hand , phone in the other , planning the big event .
Bob simply could not figure how Uncle Sam was going to pay the final bill .
A concern that disturbed Bob 's usually fitful sleep .
Friday evening arrives and Bob is exhausted and just a little annoyed - guests are arriving in droves .
After unloading fresh bales of hay , Bob turns to lock the barn door .
But there stands Uncle Sam , quickly reaching out his hand .
" Bob , leave the door open .
We need the space to store stuff for the party , " Uncle Sam says with a coy smile .
Against better judgment , Bob complies .
He leaves the door wide open , wipes his forehead , and heads toward his warm meal .
We can guess the ending .
The party is the event of the year .
As expected , in the morning the yard is a mess and the barn is empty save a few bales littered here and there .
Uncle Sam is still around , seated at the breakfast table , looking tired but happy .
Bob is irate , " Sam , how could you do that ?
It 's all gone ; my savings , my future . "
Uncle Sam is unshaken .
" Look , I used your hay to stimulate the local economy -- it was a real boom , was n't it ?
And do n't worry , your barn will soon burst with hay once the multiplier takes over .
Trust me . "
" Multiplier ? "
Bob shakes his head .
He knows the hard work involved in the production process .
And Bob knows that it is only hard work that leads to savings and a future .
While Uncle Sam reaches for seconds , Bob quickly downs a second cup of coffee and heads to the fields .
He has a lot of work to do .
The question remains : During the week of Uncle Sam 's visit , what was Bob 's savings rate ?
Is it based on the 500 bales he reaped but did not directly consume ?
Is it based on the 495 bales that survived pests and mold ?
What about the 300 set aside for the winter ?
How about the 195 to be exchanged at the market for current goods , services , and loans ?
Or , is his rate of savings based on the 3,000 odd bales that are no longer in the barn due to the booming party thrown by his Uncle Sam ?
Hollywood to Turn " Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs " Into Shitty , Nihilistic Movie
When I was a kid , before I could read , before I learned to get obsessed with girls , I was obsessed by a little perfect picture book that my poor , patient grandmother read to me over and over again until I was banished outside to eat bugs , a book called " Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs , " by Judi and Ron Barrett .
The story is simple : it is the legend of the land of Chewandswallow , a place where instead of rain , snow , wind , and ice , the residents are showered daily with food .
Each day , folks in Chewandswallow check the local weather report and see what they will be eating that day -- hamburgers , fish , iced cream , apple cobbler , steak , or jello .
Food rains down three times a day and is scooped up by the sanitation department , who snap the food up into tupperware containers for later .
In Chewandswallow , al fresco is de rigeur .
You sit there with your plate in front of you and you wait .
But then , things start to go wrong .
Giant , horrible food starts to precipitate for no reason .
Flapjacks destroy schools .
Huge , buttery muffins crush automobiles .
And then the food gets disgusting .
It rains nothing but Gorgonzola cheese for days .
For weeks , there is nothing but peanut butter sandwiches .
The food falling from the sky has become suddenly , impossibly hostile .
And so the people of Chewandswallow build huge rafts made of stale bread and sail away into the modern world , where you have to grow food and cook it .
It 's the story of the Garden of Eden stripped of the religious paranoia and delivered as a pure , rollicking tale that made my feverish toddler mind spin like an overloaded washing machine .
In addition to having a beautiful , pointless story ( you could argue that it is a parable about modern environmental disaster , but really it is about motherfucking food falling from the motherfucking sky ) , " Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs " contains beautiful illustrations that are so meticulous that I thought they were photographs from a world beyond dreams , a world that would open to me someday if I prepared myself for it .
I have told everyone I know about this book .
Over the years , I have used " Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs " as an example of what a story should be : simple , clean , devastating , and perverse .
But now I wo n't have to tell anyone about this story ever again .
Because it will be released next September as a new Hollywood animated movie !
Unlike the original children 's book , this film has a fun new message .
You should n't try to fix the world 's persistent and nightmarish hunger problem with science .
Or maybe you should .
Who knows ?
I guess you have to ask one of the " ratbirds .
"
If I ever meet the person responsible for this movie , I will introduce myself and -- if they look like they can take it -- I will slap them so hard in the face that they will feel it for years and will be forever scarred , the inch - deep impression of a crazy man 's hand - print branded into their cheek like an embarrassing birth defect .
Maybe the movie will be a smash - hit animated success , but most likely it will be another lank , soggy link of feces squirted from the flaccid anus of an increasingly irrelevant , increasingly empty medium .
Hollywood is an industry built on the raped , tortured bodies of insubstantial creatures too weak to defend themselves : pure stories snatched from their parents and contorted by modern comprechecos into disgusting , disfigured carnival attractions at which the benumbed masses are invited to mock and jeer .
Someday , Hollywood will destroy something from your childhood that you love , you will be slapped yourself , and you will see film for what it is : a traveling carnival of horrors where the ravaged souls of the dead are forced to dance , sing , and entertain for eternity .
Go ahead .
Buy another DVD .
Carve another bleeding hole in the chest of another infant story , and fuck another beautiful story to death in its tender , too - weak heart .
Someday the stories will have their revenge .
Raw Sockets Basics Presentation
Description : Raw Socket programming is probably one of the most important topics in network security .
Almost most of network security consists of either monitoring a network or protecting it from an attack .
Network monitoring requires that everything going on in the host network can be seen by the security device .
This is accomplished by what is called Packet Sniffing .
Also , techniques used to actively protect a network generally inject their own custom built packets - this is done by using Packet Injection .
In this 2 part video presentation , we will look at the basics of Packet Sniffing and Packet Injection and try and understand how to make Packet Sniffing and Packet Injection programs .

The University of Chicago is hosting an interdisciplinary project called Defining Wisdom .
The idea is to draw on work across disciplines – philosophy , psychology , sociology , etc. – to try to gain a better picture of the nature and benefits of wisdom .
I like the idea , though the project is still in a very early stage , and not a lot has come of it yet .
Psychologists like Dan Gilbert ( see his TED talk here ) have shown that “ happiness ” – or at least many features of happiness — is not unreachable through experimental methods .
Why not think the same is true of “ wisdom ” ?
There is a rough consensus of when the label is used correctly , which makes it prima facie plausible that there is some real meaning behind the term .
My own sense is that wisdom simply means knowing what ’s important .
This could be over a narrow domain : a mechanic can be car - wise or a lawyer law - wise if they know their subjects well enough to sort through the noise and grasp what ’s essential in the problems that come before them .
Or the knowledge could be over the broad domain of life , as when people know what activities and relationships are important in life , and gear their lives toward them .
So how do you figure out what ’s important ?
Through the tumble of experience , usually .
You find out what ’s not important the hard way – by spending too much time with it and realizing that your time has been wasted .
If you are lucky , you will stumble across something that really feels significant , meaning ( I guess ) that it gives you a lasting happiness , or at least a lack of lasting unhappiness .
Seems like most humans find good interpersonal relationships , mental stimulation , and physical health to be important .
Some also get that significant feeling by joining into a humanitarian cause that extends their concerns beyond their own lives .
( See Gilbert ’s talk , linked above , about what generally leads to human happiness . )
Two concerns , though .
First , it seems possible for someone to be wise without being anywhere near happiness .
Think of Schopenhauer .
It does n’t seem at all wrong to call him a wise philosopher , but his wisdom consisted in the insight that all existence is suffering and it would have been better not to have been born .
Second , I can imagine someone taking the stance that “ just because you think you ’ve found wisdom , and feel all happy about it , does n’t mean you are genuinely wise . ”
I think the Schopenhauer concern – and we could throw in the Stoics as well – shows that happiness is n’t the only measure of wisdom .
There is a truth component to wisdom in addition to the emotional component .
If I feel happiness as a result of false beliefs , I ’m not wise .
I ’m just a lucky fool .
On the other hand , if I self - consciously dupe myself with the aim of feeling happy , then maybe I am wise ; maybe my wisdom is that happiness is the only valuable state , and one should seek whatever brings it about .
But that would be an intentional self - deception based on a truthful insight .
There is plenty of room for substantive discussion here – is it ever wise to dupe oneself ?
Are there truths we should avoid learning ?
But these are questions well worth asking .
I hope the “ Defining Wisdom ” project gets on with discussing them .
This requirement – that wisdom has to be grounded in truth – goes a long way to answering the second concern as well .
At any moment , I might think I am wise , and have found true bliss , etc. – but there ’s always , always the possibility I ’ve deceived myself and oversimplified the world .
No , not just the possibility : the probability .
As Dr. House teaches , “ Everybody lies . ”
This is one of the most frequently asked questions I ’ve been receiving lately both at work and via email .
Companies across the country are trying to find ways to cut costs during this recession and a prime target is the matching program on a 401k or 403b .
This is bad news for employees , but the silver lining is that cutting the match may reduce the need for cutting jobs .
That might be a glass half - full way to think about it , but what if your match is taken away ?
Should you still contribute ?
Is a maximum 401k contribution worth it ?
Should you switch to an IRA ?
Or is it time to give up on retirement saving completely ?
There ’s no easy answer that works for everyone .
In some cases it may make sense to keep contributing while in others it might make sense to stop .
So , let ’s look at what you need to consider before making that decision .
Eligibility for IRAs
When it comes to saving for retirement , most people will utilize one of the two most common individual retirement accounts — the traditional and Roth IRA .
Without getting into a lesson on the differences between a traditional IRA and Roth IRA , we ’re going to work with the most notable difference in that a traditional IRA is funded with pre-tax dollars and qualified withdrawals are taxed , and the Roth IRA is funded with after - tax dollars and qualified withdrawals are tax - free .
Before you give up on your 401 k you need to make sure you ’re eligible for contributing to an IRA .
After all , if you ’re ineligible to receive the tax benefits that IRAs provide , even without a match it would make sense to keep contributing to your 401k .

How to roll over your 401k into an IRA
Roth IRA
Eligibility for a Roth IRA depends on your income .
As a married couple you would qualify for a Roth IRA if your modified adjusted gross income ( MAGI ) is below $ 173,000 .
If MAGI is between $ 173,000 and $ 183,000 , then you can contribute some , but not the full amount .
If income exceeds $ 183,000 , you do not qualify for any current year Roth IRA contributions .
Single filers begin phasing out of a Roth IRA at $ 107,000 and is gone completely at $ 125,000 .
As you can see , depending on your income , giving up your 401k in favor of a Roth IRA may not even be an option .
It ’s a good idea to have a Roth IRA if you qualify , but just keep the income limits in mind before stopping your contributions with your current plan .
Traditional IRA
Here ’s where things get a little more tricky .
Unlike a Roth , a traditional IRA is funded with pre-tax dollars , so this type of retirement account closely matches your 401( k ) .
If you were looking to mirror what you ’re currently doing from a tax perspective , this is your likely candidate .
That being said , the IRS does n’t make it easy for us .
There are also income limits and other considerations that need to be addressed before qualifying for tax - deductible contributions .
The deductibility phase out for a traditional IRA for a single filer begins at $ 56,000 and ends at $ 66,000 if you ’re currently covered under an employer - sponsored retirement plan .
Joint filers phase out between $ 90,000 and $ 110,000 .
If married and your spouse is not covered by an employer plan , then there is no limit for you .
I emphasized a piece of information above because there is often a lot of confusion as to what this means .
Being covered by an employer - sponsored retirement plan has nothing to do with whether or not you ’re contributing to a 401 ( k ) .
Just because you elect not to does n’t mean you ’re not covered .
As long as you have a plan and could contribute to it , as far as the IRS is concerned you ’re still bound to the income limits .
Furthermore , other pension and profit - sharing plans would also count .
So even if your employer eliminated the 401 ( k ) completely but still provided some sort of pension benefit , that ’s considered being covered under an employer plan and subject to income limitations .
Other IRA Considerations
Finding out if you ’re eligible for an IRA is the first step , so what ’s the next step if you are ?
First , decide which type of IRA would be most beneficial for you .
Are you single , no kids , and no major tax deductions ?
You may enjoy the continued benefits of deducting current contributions from your taxes with a traditional IRA .
If you ’re looking ahead to the future and expect your income to increase and tax rates to be higher , then a Roth IRA that gives you tax - free withdrawals in retirement may be your best bet .
As long as you qualify , you could opt for an IRA of each type .
To get started with your IRA , you have a few different options .
First , you can open up an IRA with one of the big no -load fund companies such as Vanguard or Fidelity directly .
Keep in mind that there may be a minimum investment requirement to get started .
But this is a good way to invest directly in the low - cost funds you want .
The other option is to open your IRA with a discount brokerage company such as TradeKing .
With a brokerage IRA you will have more flexibility in terms of investment options .
Here you can buy individual stocks , bonds , ETFs , mutual funds , and even CDs all within the same account .
If you ’re looking to move beyond index funds with just one company , this can provide some flexibility as long as you keep transaction costs down , which TradeKing will do .
Finally , do n’t overlook the reduced IRA annual contribution limits .
In 2009 you ’re only allowed $ 5,000 ( $ 6,000 if age 50 + ) per year in IRA contributions .
If are currently putting more than this amount into your 401 ( k ) you ’d want to make sure you ’re still contributing as much as you can .
For example , if you have been contributing $ 10,000 to your 401 ( k ) and want to switch to an IRA , you should max out your IRA with $ 5,000 and reduce your 401 ( k ) contribution to $ 5,000 .
This way you ’re still adding your $ 10,000 to your retirement accounts each year , but it ’s simply divided across two accounts .
Some Final Considerations
A 401(k ) without a match is still a viable retirement account , although the deal is obviously not as sweet without the free match money .
If you ’re considering the switch , be sure you take into account all aspects of the plan .
While 401 ( k ) plans get discussed in the news about high fees , remember that not all plans are created equal .
Obviously , if you ’re in a plan with high fees and you do qualify for an IRA , the decision is pretty simple .
But there are a number of plans that may also have even better fees than you can get no your own .
For example , my 401 ( k ) plan has institutional variants of funds , including some Vanguard and Fidelity .
That means after all said and done , my net expenses are the same or even lower on these funds than I could get in my own IRA .
So , if your company drops the company match and you ’re trying to decide what to do :
Examine your current plan , check expenses and fund offerings , and see if the match has been temporarily suspended or eliminated indefinitely .
Check to see what type of IRA you qualify for , and if eligible , decide whether a traditional or Roth is better for your situation .
Open the necessary IRA through a no-load fund company or discount brokerage such as TradeKing .
Make sure you ’re still contributing the same amount or more to your retirement accounts even if this means contributing to both an IRA and your 401( k ) .
Just because your company stopped matching does n’t mean you should contribute less overall .
Prepare for changes to your tax situation .
Going from a 401 ( k ) to a Roth IRA could have an impact on your taxes , so plan accordingly .
I hope that helps clear things up when faced with this question .
As you can see , there are many reasons to switch to an IRA if your company drops the match , some of which I did n’t even touch on here .
But there are also a number of limitations that need to be taken into account before making that decision as well .
There may not be a right or wrong answer to this question , but if you ’re armed with all the facts , you can make sure you ’re making the most reasonable decision for your situation .
Improving performance is one of Microsoft 's design goals with Windows 7 , and many early reviewers ( including ours ) have said that the new OS seems peppier than Vista .
But tests of the Windows 7 Release Candidate in our PC World Test Center found that while Windows 7 was slightly faster on our WorldBench 6 suite , the differences may be barely noticeable to users .
We loaded the Windows 7 Release Candidate on three systems ( two desktops and a laptop ) and then ran our WorldBench 6 suite .
Afterward we compared the results with the WorldBench 6 numbers from the same three systems running Windows Vista .
Each PC was slightly faster when running Windows 7 , but in no case was the overall improvement greater than 5 percent , our threshold for when a performance change is noticeable to the average user .
The largest difference was 4 points -- 102 for Vista versus 106 for Windows 7 on an HP Pavillion a6710t desktop .
Our other two test machines showed similarly minor performance improvements : A Maingear M4A79T
Deluxe desktop improved by 1 point ( from 138 on Vista to 139 on Windows 7 ) , and a Dell Studio XPS 16 laptop improved by 2 points , from 97 on Vista to 99 on Windows 7 .
WorldBench 6 consists of a number of tests involving ten common applications , including Microsoft Office , Firefox , and Photoshop .
On the individual tests , the benchmark results were generally within a few percentage points of each other .
One notable exception , however , was Nero 7 Ultra Edition , where Windows 7 made significant improvements , ranging from a 12 percent speedup to a 26 percent speedup , depending on the PC we used in our tests .
Although we have yet to confirm it , PC World Test Center Director Jeff Kuta notes that this difference may be due to updated hard - disk drivers in Windows 7 .
Any improvements to Windows 7's disk support will be more noticeable in an application like Nero , which uses the hard drive heavily .
The test involving WinZip , another hard - drive - dependent task , also showed marked improvement under Windows 7 .
We also measured a noteworthy 7 percent speed increase in our Autodesk 3ds max 8.0 SP3 ( DirectX ) test on the HP Pavillion desktop , which had an nVidia GeForce 9300 GE graphics board .
n Vidia 's drivers appear to be better optimized for Windows 7 than Windows Vista .
In contrast , however , each of the systems took slightly longer to perform the tests in Microsoft Office and Firefox when they were running the new operating system than when they were running Vista .
Of course , it 's important to remember that we performed these tests with the release candidate of Windows 7 .
Though the operating system 's features likely wo n't change in the final version , Microsoft ’s engineers may still find ways to tweak the code to improve performance .
If these test results remain consistent with those for the final version of Windows 7 , the news will likely be disappointing to many Windows users .
One of the major complaints about Windows Vista was the fact that it was consistently slower than Windows XP .
If Windows 7 does n’t significantly improve that situation , it may fail to convince people to move away from Windows XP .
That said , there may be other areas we did n't cover in our testing -- such as startup times -- where Windows 7 may outperform Windows Vista by a wider margin .
The best way for you to get a feel for Windows 7's performance is to download the release candidate and take it for a test drive on your system .
How We Test
We used three PCs in our testing : a Maingear M4A79T Deluxe desktop , an HP Pavillion a6710t desktop , and a Dell Studio XPS 16 laptop .
The powerful Maingear comes equipped with a 3.2GHz AMD Phenom II X4 955 Black Edition CPU overclocked to 3.71GHz , 4GB of memory , and dual ATI Radeon HD 4890 graphics processors .
The Pavilion , a mainstream desktop , features a 2.6GHz dual - core Pentium E5300 with 3GB of memory and an nVidia GeForce 930 GE graphics chip .
Lastly , the Dell Studio XPS 16 laptop packs a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor , 4GB of memory , and an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3670 graphics card .
On all three systems , we ran our WorldBench 6 benchmark suite on a clean installation of the 32 - bit edition of Windows Vista Ultimate with SP1 and repeated the process with the Windows 7 Ultimate release candidate ( again , the 32 - bit version ) .
We made both operating systems current with Windows Update , and we installed the most current hardware drivers available .
John Osher is the protagonist of that story .
You know it well .
It inspired you to begin inventing and continues to give you hope in the darkest of days .
It ’s as rare as it is remarkable .
For John Osher , lightning has indeed struck twice .
And three and four times …
He ’s the creator of the smash toy - candy “ Spin Pop ” , a lollipop that sits atop a battery operated handle , twirling the sweet treat in your mouth .
In it ’s inception , the Spin Pop created an entirely new category of products , now known as “ interactive candy ” .
The Spin Pop , born in 1996 , sells around the world today .
But the product , successful as it might have been and still is , was merely the precedent for Osher ’s next bigger and better creation .
Osher is the inventor of the “ Spin Brush ” , which he sold to Proctor and Gamble in 2001 for 475 million dollars .
How ’d he do it ?
I want to first make clear that Osher ’s story is FAR from the typical inventor ’s experience .
But it ’s relevant nonetheless because many of the skills he used to bring his product to market , despite having sophisticated design teams , established contacts , and sufficient funds , are the same ones you must master .
Osher approached the creation of the Spin Brush in a unique manner .
“ In 1997 , after the sale of the Spin Pop to Hasbro , I got together with a group of designers and inventors , many of whom I previously worked with .
We decided to purposefully invent a new product – rather than having an idea come to us , we would actively seek a great new one .
We wandered the aisles of WalMart and Walgreens , eventually conceiving of over one hundred ideas .
Creating an electric toothbrush that would retail for five dollars was at the top of the list . ”
Osher knew the potential market for such a product was enormous – every sex , race , religion , creed brushed their teeth , right ?
But because the retail price of electric toothbrushes between seventy and eighty dollars , the product simply was n’t affordable .
But Osher had the technology to create a new electric toothbrush – he would apply the same technique utilized by the inexpensive toy candy twirler to a toothbrush .
“ Our design group was very specific about what we wanted to invent .
A group of rules was decided on .
The brush would not cost over a dollar forty to make , and would not retail for over five dollars .
The new brush had to better than a manual one .
The brush had to last a minimum of six months , and the brush ’s batteries for three .
If any of these criteria proved to be too difficult , we would have abandoned the project .
It would n’t have been worth it . ”
But remarkably , it was .
The audacious plan was underway .
“ The most difficult task we faced was proving the Spin Brush was n’t a gimmick – that even though it was so cheap ( especially in comparison to other existing electrical toothbrushes ) , it really worked . ”
How did they begin making the Spin Brush ?

It came as good news yesterday from Attorney General Eric Holder that the government is n't going to prosecute any Central Intelligence Agency officials who participated in the government 's waterboarding interrogations .
Mr. Holder cited the simple logic that it would be unfair to prosecute these officials for acts ruled legal at the time by the Justice Department .
Mr. Holder also pointedly said the U.S would defend the CIA interrogators against attempted prosecutions from overseas .

Did the U.S. Secretary of State actually criticize Israel ?
At a joint press conference with Mahmoud Abbas ?
That 's new :
BRUSSELS , March 4 -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday criticized the Israeli government for plans to demolish dozens of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem , calling the actions " unhelpful " and a violation of international obligations .
Clinton made the rare public complaint about Israeli actions in response to a question at a joint news conference with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah , on the West Bank .
Israeli plans to destroy the homes in Arab East Jerusalem , which Palestinians consider the capital of a potential Palestinian state , have touched a nerve in Palestinian society .
The Jerusalem municipal government in recent weeks began planning to evict 1,500 residents and raze 88 homes in an area designated as a national park , on top of other demolition plans in the Silwan area .
Israel says the homes were built without permits , but Palestinians say permits are impossible to obtain and that many of the homes were built before Israeli occupation in 1967 .
" It is a matter of deep concern to those who are directly affected , but the ramifications go far beyond the individuals and families that have received the notices , " Clinton said .
" It will be taken up with the Israeli government . "
Most of the high - end tuning companies in Germany focus on turning out extreme creations based on BMW , Mercedes - Benz and Audi models .
And why not — all of these are produced in their own back yard and the native engineering prowess is extensive .
So when a tuner in Germany decides to focus on American brands like Hummer and Cadillac and pump out muscle cars such as the Corvette and Mustang , they tend to stand out .
In fact the closest Geiger even comes to touching a European car is the Infinity brand , and that ’s still not so close .
The newest creation from Geiger Cars is the Wild Thing based on the Corvette Z06 .
This beast puts out 809 hp from it ’s 7.6 - liter twin - turbocharged engine .
Who ever had the possibility to drive a Corvette Z06 never complained about the engine power for sure .
After all , the US - American sport - car - icon is already powered by a series seven - liter - V8 engine with 512 hp .
Even expert drivers should be careful behind the wheel of this steam hammer , novice drivers should definitely not get behind the wheel of the Z06 .
Only a madman would want to increase the output of this fast car significant .
Karl Geiger from Munich is such a madman .
To be able to increase the output of an internal - combustion engine substantially there are basically three king ways : more cubic capacity , a charge using a turbocharger or compressor as well as classic tuning in the form of the modification of locomotive engine parts as well as the supplying of fuel and air .
GeigerCars.de has a long time experience in all of these divisions this is why Karl Geiger decided to go all three ways for the ultimate engine on base of the Corvette Z06 .
The thought of the final outcome is going to make the mouth water of hp-freaks .
But one step at a time .
Pure Power
The Geiger Bi-Turbo power package covers a flaring of the cubic capacity up to impressive 7.6 litre .
Modifications are made to the engine block , to the cylinder heads and the crank motions .
Geiger employed amplified insert springs , spring cups made of titanium , sport camshafts as well as a 100 mm air mass flow meter .
The dampers and the induction tract have been dealt with .
The cores of the engine tuning are the two high performance turbocharger , which blow air in the combustor .
And because everything that comes in in the front has to get out in the back , GeigerCars .de installed a sport exhaust system with four end pipes , each one as thick as an arm , and sport catalysts .
The paper mould of the cubic capacity giant is already more then impressive : unbelievable 890 hp at 6.100 U / min as well as 940 Nm at 4.500 tours shows the data sheet .
The maximum speed is about 354 km/h .
However , only the driving experience makes one comprehend what the numbers on the paper really mean .
I do know what I am talking about .
With an angry thunder and fizzle the Bi-Turbo - Corvette answers every gas blow with an unbelievable thrust , which seems to have the possibility to cause a whiplash injury .
Pure poison !
Karl Geiger has chosen his distinctive Geiger Green colour for this wild animal not without cause .
Carbon fibre drive chain
Of course there is not used a serial Z06 drive chain .
Built in is a boosted transmission as well as a two - disc - transmission mad of carbon in combination with a cardan shaft made of carbon .
Shaft drives and differential gear were boosted as well .
A further challenge is the diversity of the engine power on the street .
Geiger hoisted in the front 285/30 an in the back 345/25 tires on bright black coated rims .
Behind the rim star appears a high performance brake system with grooved 380×32 mm brake discs and 6 - piston - back gauges in the front and 355×32 mm discs and 4 - piston back gauges in the back .
The Geiger sport undercarriage contains sport shock absorber with 16 - fold adjustable compression , tighter compound springs as well as stabilizers for font and back axle .
Rendered broad
As usual Geiger used the in -house GT - Kit for the Corvette – car body .
The bug and the rear show a completely new and brawny appearance .
The louvred in the black hood not just look spectacular but also serve a technical purpose : they guard against thermal indispositions of the turbo engine .
Earth Day : a man -made invention ( from the makers of Valentine ’s Day & All Saints ’ Day ) , wherein its creator sets aside a 24 - hour period each day to reflect upon the other 364 days of the year when man clog ’s Mother ’ Earth pores with plastics , recyclable garbage , archaic non-plasma television sets , nuclear waste , appliances , concrete slabs , dead sex toys , and aluminum canisters filled with petty rationalizations and excuses as to why Americans feel the need to bend Mama Earth over and stick it to her every non-Earth Day of the year .
Like insincere New Year ’s Resolutions , we Americans used Earth Day as an excuse to take time away from producing more waste to make vows not to produce more waste .
The big question is how many of us , when we wake up tomorrow morning with an environmental hangover , will actually remember the promises we made in the global warming of the moment while trying to get into Mama Earth ’s pants .
That said , I ’ve decided to strike preemptively by going public with my vows to help protect Mother Earth ’s borders :
1 . Whenever somebody tells me Global Warming is a hoax ( which usually happens on an uncharacteristically cold day in Iowa ) , I will open up a can of Lysol on ‘em and spray the CFCs in their eyes and say : “ How does that feel , naysayer ?
You think Mother Earth likes it ?
Do you ?
Huh ? ” ( Note : this is merely a hoax , so if anyone should go blind or bleed from the eyes , chalk it up as mere happenstance . )
2. Participate in the “ Litterbug Catch and Release Program . ”
Any time I see somebody litter or flick their cigarette butt on the ground , I will apprehend them and call the authorities , who will arrest them and either release them on the other side of the ozone layer or sentence them to hard time in a nearby land fill ( formerly known as “ The Dump ” ) .
3 . Stop using modifiers in the future .
4. Team up with Mother Earth ’s Creators , Klaatu and Gort ( aka Jesus and God ) and film a sequel to the original “ The Day the Earth Stood Still ” ( not to be confused with the recently recycled version starring Keanu Reeves , whose acting career has been overly recycled beyond the Best - When - Used - By Date : “ Bill and Ted ’s Excellent Adventure ” ) .
In the new film , “ The Day the Earth Stood Full , ” we will declare Inertia on Earth , holding earthlings hostage until they meet our demands : Appoint WALL -E Czar of Earth , stop using doublespeak to mask threats against Earth ( e.g. “ clean coal ” ) , and boot Keanu Reeves out of the Actors ’ Guild – no questions asked .
5 . Recycle this post .
teaching the controversy where none exists
Yet more shenanigans from the Texas School Board of Education , this time about the age of the universe and the basics of cosmology .
Texas State Board of Education member Barbara Cargill tells us that it will be beneficial for students to have some intense discussions about things like redshift and cosmic microwave background radiation , two main pieces of the Big Bang cosmological model that have been observed for many decades .
She also wants us to note that the age of the observable universe is “ estimated to be between 12 and 14 billion years which leaves a little room for discussion as to how many billions . ”
( The answer is two by the way . )
And she should know how to teach astronomy .
After all , she was a high school biology teacher who taught at her local church ’s Sunday School on the side .
And she fervently believes in creationism , parroting the “ teach the controversy doctrine ” on her website .
You know , the controversy in which over 99 % of biologists say that evolution is pretty much a fact and all we need to do it to keep studying it in depth ?
I wonder what her students were actually learning in the classroom …
The same “ controversy ” applies to concepts of redshift and CMBR .
Astronomers see them every time one of their instruments is pointed to the sky .
We know they ’re there .
What is there to debate ?
That they do n’t exist ?
That they were measured improperly ?
What does she propose to debate about ?
The variation in our estimate of the age of the visible universe is approximately 120 million years .
Not billions as she claims .
Maybe we should ask her colleague , Don McLeroy , the man who thinks it ’s perfectly rational to assume that Earth is just 6,000 years old because that ’s what he was told in church and who ’s website declares that it ’s his duty to spread creationism to students , what he thinks about this age of the universe business since he would also be imminently qualified to pronounce judgment on cosmology as a former dentist .
Of course he got way too aggressive in pushing his pseudoscientific agendas and his confirmation to another term was declared to be dead in the water so he would be of little help to Cargill , but they certainly seem to share the belief that if we try to push religion out of science class , it ’s their duty to politick it in anyway .
Probably the most important question in all this is why a biology teacher who ca n’t grasp evolution and a fiery zealot who ’s only brush with science was dentistry , are dictating science education curriculums ?
Why does n’t the testimony from experts or public glares of disapproval phase them when they ’re shown to be wrong ?
Oh , and in case you were wondering , the guidelines for “ intense debate ” over the very basics of astronomy given by Cargill passed with an 11 to 3 vote tally .
I wonder what they ’re going to debate next .
Maybe encourage “ very intense discussions ” about the shape of the Earth or heliocentrism ?
And when will they learn that science is not up for voting and facts are facts no matter what you think of them ?

Interviewed last week , John Holdren , President Obama 's chief scientific adviser , said that drastic measures should not be " off the table " in discussions on how best to tackle climate change and that geo- engineering could not be ruled out .
Making clear these were his personal views , he said : " It 's got to be looked at .
We do n't have the luxury of taking any approach off the table . "
He 's right .
We do n't have that luxury – not only because the Kyoto protocol 's first phase , running to 2012 , is manifestly failing , but because the emissions reduction approach that it embodies cannot succeed .
It is manifestly failing because emissions are going ahead faster than even the worst scenarios considered by the IPCC , which provides scientific assessments to the UN Climate Convention and because many rich countries are on course to fall short of their emissions reductions commitments .
Research since the IPCC 's last assessment reveals that the threat of climatic disaster is more serious than previously supposed .
Several threats exist but the most imminent is probably a collapse of substantial areas of land - based ice into the oceans , as studies of ancient climates show happened in previous warming phases .
This seems likely to be due to the lubrication of Greenland 's ice floes by water that accumulates year after year , with warmer summers melting the surface and rivers of melt - water flowing down crevasses to the bedrock , making the underside of the ice increasingly mushy and prone to slip down towards the ocean .
Reports from Greenland , of increased frequency of " ice- quakes " , suggest that areas of the ice cover have slipped and bumped into other areas that are still stuck .
When the last bit gives way there may be an unstoppable rush of ice into the ocean , as with ancient warming phases , raising ocean levels by several metres over a few decades .
" Probably " ?
" Likely " ?
" Suggest " ?
" Maybe " ?
Yes , all is uncertain and the models are inadequate .
But you do n't drive full - speed down a twisty lane on a foggy winter 's night hoping there 's no ice round the next bend .
A measure of the threat is the accumulation of warmth from successive summers , which is making the glaciers ' undersides increasingly mushy .
Even a deeply implausible reduction of emissions to zero in 25 years sees that measure treble over the next half - century with no end in sight .
So something more than emissions reductions is needed .
We must take CO2 out of the atmosphere or prevent some of the sun 's radiation from reaching the surface .
But geo -engineering is usually thought of as shielding the earth from solar radiation by whitening clouds and by putting reflectors in space between earth and sun .
The latter seems difficult to reverse and perhaps a very last resort .
But whitening clouds can be quickly halted .
It involves putting sulphur aerosols into the clouds in amounts that are trivial compared with the effects of either volcanic eruptions or coal burning worldwide .
Or injecting saltwater micro-particles into ocean clouds which , whitened , then rain slightly salty water back into the oceans .
Amazing though it may seem , these apparently hopeful options are opposed by NGOs that seem more willing to run the risk of climatic catastrophe than deviate from the emissions reductions gospel .
Their concern seems to be that geo-engineering will result in relaxed pressure to reduce emissions , which neglects the reality that more ambitious commitments will obviously go with increased capability to mitigate .
They even oppose research , unlike Holdren 's " it 's got to be looked at " .
The British researcher Tim Lenton uses the term geo-engineering to mean any way of cooling the earth that is not emissions reductions ( even growing trees , which is included under the Kyoto protocol ) .
His definition puts me – somewhat to my surprise – among the ranks of geo-engineers , as I have long advocated widespread tree - planting programmes , such as those initiated by the Nobel Peace laureate Wangari Muta Maathai , founder of the Green Belt Movement , which has planted more than 30 m trees across Kenya .
Growing trees is one way of stocking carbon out of the linked ocean - atmosphere system .
Others advocate fuelling power stations with energy crops and capturing CO2 from flue gases and piping them into deep saline aquifers .
A third option is biochar , current darling of the policy community , which promises not only to store carbon in the soil but to provide rural energy supplies and raise soil productivity as the basis for sustainable rural development .
Yet even this win - win - win prospect is rejected by 129 NGOs who have declared " Biochar – a new big threat to people land and ecosystems " .
I would rather listen to the 1,500 poor subsistence farmers in Kumba , south - west Cameroon , who are already experiencing its benefits and who deny rich - country NGO claims that civil society in the developing world rejects biochar .

The crew of the International Space Station ( ISS ) have celebrated a new on - board water system by raising a toast of their own recycled urine .
They clinked their water bags together and said " cheers " , before telling ground control the water was " great " .
The system collects urine , sweat and atmospheric moisture and recycles it into purified water .
It is seen as an important step forward in plans to double the crew on the ISS by the end of May .
" This has been the stuff of science fiction , " said Flight Engineer Mike Barratt .
" Everybody 's talked about recycling water in a closed loop system but nobody 's ever done it before .
Here we are today with the first round of recycled water . "
He told ground control that " the taste is great , " but joked it should come in bottles with labels advising it should be drunk " when real water is over 200 miles away " .
Mars plans
The ISS is expected to have a crew of six by the end of May The system is connected to the station 's Waste and Hygiene Compartment toilet and also recovers and recycles moisture from the station 's atmosphere .
It was installed on the ISS in November 2008 and has been producing the water since March this year , when a valve was replaced .
The three astronauts were given approval to try the water on Wednesday , after tests on 20l ( 5.28 gallons ) brought back to Earth by earlier missions deemed it safe for consumption .
Kirk Shireman , ISS Deputy Programme manager in Houston , Texas , said the success was an important milestone in the station 's development as it reduces the amount of water which would need to be carried to the ISS in the future .
The system will also " test out a key technology required for sending humans on long duration missions to the moon and Mars , " said Mr Shireman .

Much is known about the rule of Moctezuma II , the great 16th - century supreme military commander and " divine leader " who inspired worldwide awe with his battle - hardiness and wondrous ability to mediate with the Gods .
Historians have marvelled at his creative achievements over the largest empire in Meso - America , feared for its military might and bloodthirsty human sacrifices .
The tale of his downfall , on the other hand , is a cautionary example of the dangers of trust : the Aztec ruler met his end at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors who arrived on his shores and apparently beguiled him into a friendship that ended in incarceration and death .
Yet after centuries of study and archeological discovery , Moctezuma , the man , remains virtually unreachable to historians .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Almost nothing has been gleaned about the personality of the last great elected Aztec ruler , who leaves the loyalties of Mexicans utterly divided to this day because he is believed to have colluded with the incoming Spanish colonial power against his own people .
Now , though , a new blockbuster exhibition at the British Museum will attempt to solve some of the mysteries surrounding a myth that has long been impenetrable .
" Moctezuma : Aztec Ruler " is the fourth and last in the British Museum 's series of big shows about emperors .
It will present a revisionist view of the leader that looks set to reveal the monarch in more intimate detail than has ever been possible before .
That progress is the result of new evidence emanating from an archeological study currently being undertaken in Moctezuma 's palace , in what is now Mexico City .
The show 's curator , Colin McEwan , admitted that personal details about Moctezuma are so scarce that one academic thought the exhibition , which opens on 24 September , would be impossible .
Even first - hand descriptions of his life are full of contradictions , which means that the style in which he ruled , to say nothing of the character of the man , remain elusive .
But there are some details that can be pinned down .
We know that Moctezuma II , or Montezuma as he is sometimes called , was the last elected Aztec emperor and ruled over an empire that stretched from the shores of the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico .
As a battle - hardened general , he was appointed supreme military commander before being elected as " ruling lord " in 1502 , when he built a new palace in his capital Tenochtitlan ( modern day Mexico City ) .
While we will never have the benefit of a full character study , we can surely glean something of the emperor 's personality from his name , which means " he who frowns like a lord " .
By all accounts , this was a lord with good reason to frown : Moctezuma wrestled with a great number of woes during his reign .
Although he was seen as a cunning and fearsome legislator , heavy centralised taxation provoked resentment in outlying areas .
And that headache paled in comparison with the problem of how to deal with the arrival of the Spanish conquistador Herná * Cortés , who landed at Veracruz with just a few hundred men in 1519 .
When Cortés attempted to march on to Tenochtitlán , he was well received by Moctezuma , but that kindness was not returned , and eventually the emperor was taken prisoner .
Although he was eventually restored to the throne , he was never again more than a vassal of Spain : the long - accepted version of events is that dissident groups among his people rebelled and stoned him to death .
But the truth , the British Museum suggests , is rather different .
In fact , the new exhibition claims , he was ruthlessly murdered by the Spanish when he was no longer of use .
Curators point to the evidence gathered in the new show , which will display together for the first time two 16th - century manuscripts brought in from Mexico and Glasgow University .
The documents feature small figures among a wealth of detailed illustrations of the first encounters between Aztecs and Spaniards which have have only recently caught scholars ' attention .
In the images , both manuscripts show Moctezuma shackled or with a rope around his neck .
Descriptions of the emperor 's death have documented the grief felt among the colonial force .
The account of Bernal Díaz del Castillo 's " True History of the Conquest of New Spain " portrays a noble leader who won the hearts of his captors .
He wrote : " Cortes and all of us captains and soldiers wept for him , and there was no one among us that knew him and had dealings with him who did not mourn him as if he were our father , which was not surprising , since he was so good .
" It was stated that he had reigned for 17 years , and was the best king they ever had in Mexico , and that he had personally triumphed in three wars against countries he had subjugated .
I have spoken of the sorrow we all felt when we saw that Montezuma was dead . "
Díaz del Castillo went on to provide a detailed description of a debonair leader who cared about his personal appearance , kept " many mistresses " , and had a grand total of 19 children – 11 sons and 8 daughters .
" The Great Montezuma , " he wrote , " was about 40 years old , of good height , well proportioned , spare and slight , and not very dark , though of the usual Indian complexion .
He did not wear his hair long but just over his ears , and he had a short black beard , well - shaped and thin .
" His face was rather long and cheerful , he had fine eyes , and in his appearance and manner could express geniality or , when necessary , a serious composure .
He was neat and clean , and took a bath every afternoon .
" He had many women as his mistresses , the daughters of chieftains , but two legitimate wives ...
The clothes he wore one day he did not wear again until three or four days later .
He had a guard of two hundred chieftains lodged in rooms beside his own , only some of whom were permitted to speak to him . "
But not every observer agreed with that essentially benign image .
Bernardino de Sahagún , a Franciscan missionary to the Aztec people , for instance , portrayed Moctezuma as a weak - willed , superstitious and indulgent ruler .
Some historians , including James Lockhart , explain that disparity by suggesting that when the Aztecs were searching for a scapegoat for their defeat , Moctezuma was unfortunate enough to fit that role .
Claims that he was killed by his people could be seen to confound that myth .
Whatever the truth about Moctezuma 's demise , one thing is certain : the arrival of the Spanish represented the collapse of the naive world order and the imposition of a new civilisation that ultimately gave birth to modern Mexico .
Unveiling details of the exhibition , British Museum director Neil MacGregor said the story of Moctezuma presented " perhaps one of the most fascinating examples of implosion of power and the clash of civilisations " .
Moctezuma 's reputation is still contentious in Mexico , according to MacGregor .
" There has never been an exhibition on this man , a great emperor of an extremely sophisticated empire , " he said .
The exhibition will bring together spectacular loans from Europe and Mexico , including 132 objects , some of which were recently excavated from remains of the Aztec city .
Next year it will coincide with the anniversaries of the independence of Mexico in 1810 and of the Mexican revolution of 1910 .
If the picture of Moctezuma is still a little hazy , there remains hope of a resolution .
Objects are still emerging from beneath Mexico 's modern capital as part of the excavation .
With luck , those objects will have their own stories to tell .
If so , it may well be that the mysteries lying under centuries - old dust and rubble explaining the character of the great Aztec king , who had the privilege and misfortune to rule at the cusp of a new era , may yet be fully revealed .
The exhibition runs from 24 September to 24 January 2010 .

The Vancouver Canucks are the first team to advance to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs , and they made a little history in doing so .
Alex Burrows scored his second of the game with 19 seconds left in the first period of overtime as the Canucks defeated the hometown St. Louis Blues 3 - 2 in Game 4 of their Western Conference quarter - final on Tuesday .
Burrows came down the right wing in the dying seconds of OT and put one through goaltender Chris Mason 's legs for the win .
The 28 - year - old from Pincourt , Que. , was quickly mobbed by his teammates after the goal .
" I think Willie [ Mitchell ] just made a great play to get it up [ the ice ] , and I just wanted to try and get it on net , " Burrows told Scott Oake of Hockey Night in Canada .
With the win , Vancouver swept the Blues right out of the playoffs , taking the series 4 - 0 .
It marked the first time in franchise history the Canucks have accomplished that feat .
" I think we just found a way every game , I think [ goalie ] Roberto [ Luongo ] played unbelievable for us , and all 20 guys did a great job , " Burrows said .
" Now we 'll be able to relax and get ready for the second round . "
Luongo was outstanding in the game , as he was in the entire series .
He stopped 47 of 49 Blues shots , and 126 of 131 in the series .
" I do n't know , there 's a little ways to go here .
I 'll let you know in a few weeks , " Luongo said after Oake asked him whether this was the best he 's ever played in his career .
Scary situation in second
The Canucks thought they had lost Luongo late in the second period when he seemed to strain something as he stretched to keep the go - ahead - goal out of the net while St. Louis players crashed his crease .
He was down for a while but looked no worse for wear afterward .
" We have a few guys banged up , " Luongo said .
" It 's good that we 're going to get the rest now and heal up and make sure we 're ready to go when the next round starts . "
Not to be outdone , St. Louis 's Mason was just as solid in the losing effort , stopping 32 shots himself .
" I just lost [ the puck ] for a second , and I did n't close [ my legs ] up quick enough , " Mason said of Burrows 's OT winner .
" It just slipped through . "
Vancouver 's Kyle Wellwood , along with the Blues ' Brad Boyes and David Perron , scored the other goals in regulation .
St. Louis made a strong effort to keep the series going in front of its home crowd , especially in the last half of the game , but could n't break through to gain the lead .
The Blues out - shot the Canucks 49 - 36 .
Vancouver 's penalty - killing is one of the main reasons the team is heading into the second round after only four games .
The Canucks held the eighth - best power play in the regular season to a single goal in the series , killing off 23 of 24 St. Louis man-advantages .
" The one thing that killed us in the series is our power play , " Blues forward Keith Tkachuk said .
" We had opportunities throughout the series and we did n't capitalize .
" You 've got to bring it up a notch , and we did n't do that . "
Two big penalty - kills in OT
But none was bigger than the two penalties Vancouver survived in overtime .
Daniel Sedin took a hooking penalty at 6:22 and Ryan Kesler took a four - minute high - sticking penalty at 10:36 , but both were killed off thanks to stellar play from Luongo .
Canuck forward Mats Sundin sat out Tuesday 's game as he was still suffering from a lower - body injury .
He also missed Game 3 on Sunday .
Defenceman Sami Salo also missed Tuesday 's game with a lower - body injury .
Ossi Vaananen took his spot in the lineup .
Vancouver grabbed the lead at 5:20 of the first period , right after a glorious Blues scoring chance went by the wayside .
St. Louis forward Andy McDonald could n't slide one home with Luongo sprawling , and the puck went back into the Blues zone .
And that 's where St. Louis defenceman Carlo Colaiacovo made a terrible giveaway in his own end , as his pass was intercepted Canucks forward Wellwood , who danced in alone on net and deked out netminder Mason for his first goal of the playoffs .
Edler makes save
Vancouver defenceman Alex Edler helped his goalie out when he stopped a B.J. Crombeen shot on the Canucks goal - line halfway through the first .
The attempt went through Luongo , but Edler blocked the puck with his skate .
The shots were almost even in the first , with St. Louis holding a 9 - 8 edge .
Early in the second frame , Blues goalie Mason made a big save to keep his squad within one .
Henrik Sedin one - timed a pass on a two - on - one , but Mason slid across to make the pad save .
But he could n't stop an Burrows tip - in at 9:23 , when he perfectly redirected a Shane O'Brien point shot for his second of the playoffs to put Vancouver up by two .
St. Louis comes back
The Blues were held in check until 13:30 of the second , when forward Boyes took a shot and fired his own rebound into the back of the cage , cutting the deficit to 2 - 1 .
The goal brought the almost - comatose Scottrade Center back to life .
And then the crowd nearly brought the house down at 16:54 as their Blues tied the game .
St. Louis 's McDonald took a shot on Luongo and the other two Blues forwards crashed the net .
Perron ended up with the loose puck in the crease and fired it into the net to tie the game 2 - 2 .
The St. Louis wagons were circling as the Blues buzzed around the Vancouver net for the rest of the frame .
Lucky to escape
The Canucks were lucky to escape the second period with the tie ( and their goaltender intact ) , as St. Louis again crashed the net with around two minutes remaining .
On the replay the puck clearly went past the goal - line , but referee Marc Joannette disallowed the goal , saying he intended to blow the whistle before the puck went in the net even though the whistle sounded after it crossed the line .
" He meant to blow the whistle , " St. Louis coach Andy Murray said .
" He never did , but the rules say that 's enough . "
The Blues out - shot the Canucks 12 - 8 in the second .
In the third , both teams had chances to grab the lead , but big saves by both netminders kept the game deadlocked .
With 6 ½ minutes to go , Vancouver 's Steve Bernier and Mason Raymond found themselves all alone in front of the St. Louis goal with a loose puck staring them in the face , but neither could score as goalie Mason redirected the disc over the boards .
Not to be outdone , Luongo made a couple dazzlers in the Canuck crease , robbing McDonald with his glove as the Blues winger one - timed a shot near the top of the left circle , and stoning Perron on a couple chances near the three - minute mark .
St. Louis out - shot Vancouver 34 - 27 in regulation time .
The Canucks had a huge chance early in overtime to end the game on a three - on - one , but a Jannik Hansen slapshot hit the crossbar at around the two - minute mark .
Other than that , it was all Blues , as they out - shot Vancouver 10 - 1 through the first 10 minutes of overtime and 18 - 9 overall in the period before Burrows 's goal .
Colaiacovo took a roughing penalty at 14:41 of overtime for punching Burrows in the Blues crease .

One of Zizek ’s most direct , most complete critiques of ( Western ) Buddhism is an essay published by In These Times .
It starts off analyzing what Zizek calls “ a type of pop- Buddhism ” that influenced George Lucas ’ directing for his most recent Star Wars films , Episode 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Zizek quickly turns to a question of the ideologically mythic qualities of the films .
It is here that he teases out the “ ’ Christological ’ features of the young Anakin ” pitted against “ Star Wars ’ ideological framework [ of ] the New Age pagan universe . ”
This “ pagan universe ” is for Zizek , as becomes clearer later in the article , consonant with a popularly conceived Buddhist cosmos of Oneness .
For this reason , Zizek argues , Anakin ’s Christological character , one of “ Christian intolerant , violent Love , ” becomes , if he is not always - already the ultimately Evil character , Darth Vader .
This transformation is possible , inevitable even , and ultimately problematic because “ Christianity proclaims as the highest action precisely what paganism condemns as the source of all evil — the gesture of separation , of drawing the line , of clinging to an element that disturbs the balance of All . ”
The conflict arises because , Zizek elaborates , Christianity contains an ethos of difference , while Buddhism contains an ethos of indifference .
Zizek blames this clash between a perversely heroic Christological anti-hero in a Western Buddhist influenced pagan Universe for “ not only its ideological confusion , but , simultaneously , its inferior narrative quality . ”
He would have preferred to have seen a parallel between “ the shift of the Republic to Empire and of Anakin to Darth Vader , ” and that Anakin “ … become a monster out his very excessive attachment with seeing Evil everywhere and fighting it , ” rather than Lucas ’ explanation that
He turns into Darth Vader because he gets attached to things .
He ca n’t let go of his mother ; he ca n’t let go of his girlfriend .
He ca n’t let go of things .
It makes you greedy .
And when you ’re greedy , you are on the path to the dark side , because you fear you ’re going to lose things .
The difference here is that in Lucas ’ view that Anakin becomes attached to “ things , ” “ things ” are things of difference , where as in Zizek view , Anakin ’s transformation into Vader arises from an “ excessive attachment with seeing Evil everywhere [ in all things ] and fighting it . ”
In other words , this is an excessive attachment to an indifference towards things .
This ideological confusion is part of an exchange between , a switching - out of Judeo - Christian religion with so - called Western Buddhism in global Capitalist ideology .
Buddhism ’s influence is suppose to be one of passivism and moral ambiguity .
Almost out of nowhere , Zizek launches into a tested accusation of ( Western ) Buddhism “ [ presenting ] itself as the remedy against the stress of capitalism ’s dynamics — by allowing us to uncouple and retain some inner peace — it actually functions as the perfect ideological supplement . ”
The only ‘ critical ’ lesson to be drawn from Buddhism ’s perspective on virtual capitalism is that one should be aware that we are dealing with a mere theater of shadows , with no substantial existence .
Thus we need not fully engage ourselves in the capitalist game , but play it with an inner distance .
Virtual capitalism could thus act as a first step toward ‘ liberation . ’
It confronts us with the fact that the cause of our suffering is not objective reality — there is no such thing — but rather our Desire , our craving for material things .
All one has to do then , after ridding oneself of the false notion of a substantial reality , is simply renounce desire itself and adopt an attitude of inner peace and distance .
No wonder Buddhism can function as the perfect ideological supplement to virtual capitalism :
It allows us to participate in it with an inner distance , keeping our fingers crossed , and our hands clean , as it were .
This “ inner distance ” is precisely the same as the “ passive nihilism ” that Nietzsche assigns Buddhism .
Both Nietzsche and Zizek argue that Buddhism functionally provides an effective psychological , even physiological relief to the stresses of life , without resorting to the promise of a better life after life , but within this life .
When Nietzsche calls Buddhism “ a hundred more times realistic than Christianity , ” or “ a hundred times colder , more veracious , more objective , ” Zizek echoes him in claiming that Western Buddhism is “ a fetish ” in the sense that “ fetishists are not dreamers lost in their own private worlds , they are thoroughly ‘ realists , ’ able to accept the way things effectively are — since they have their fetish to which they can cling in order to cancel the full impact of reality . ”
What does Zizek mean by the term “ Western Buddhism ” ?
In On Belief , he calls it “ today ’s counterpoint to Western Marxism , as opposed to ‘ Asiatic ’ Marxism - Leninism . ”
This is a mostly useless explanation unfortunately , because Zizek never , for as strongly opinionated he is about Buddhism , discusses primary sources , the things the Buddha taught — except for the milieu of secondary , tertiary , quaternary , and otherwise ungrounded interpretations of the Buddha ’s teachings ( buddha - dhamma ) that actually constitute the primary source of ( Zizek ’s ) Western Buddhism .
There may be , however , a useful parallel to Zizek ’s Western Buddhism in what Nietzsche called “ a Buddhism for Europeans . ”
This kind of Buddhism was primarily represented in Schopenhauer and his following .
It also arose from the scholarship on Buddhism and India available at the time , then called “ buddhology ” and “ indology . ”
Because Nietzsche was a philologist , at a time when indological and buddhological scholarship was essentially philological in nature , he was friends with and influenced by some of the prominent scholars at the time , like Paul Deussen and Ernst Wunsch .
Except for Coomaraswamy ’s abridged English translation of the Sutta - Nipata , a small collection of aphorisms and sayings composed almost entirely in verse , like the more well - known Dhammapada , Nietzsche only knew Buddhism through secondary sources at best .
It is hard to say with certainty that Zizek has not engaged with primary sources of Buddhist philosophy and practice .
As far as his written works are concerned though , he rarely engages the teachings of the Buddha , or any primary sources , but always the phenomena and so - called teachings of ( Western ) Buddhism .
However at times he is ready to throw away any possibility of a distinction between his scholarly neologism and any traditional , even if sectarian , practice of the buddha - dhamma .
One should add that it is no longer possible to oppose this Western Buddhism to its ‘ authentic ’
Oriental version ; the case of Japan delivers here the conclusive evidence .
Not only do we have today , among the Japanese top managers , the wide - spread “ corporate Zen ” phenomenon ; in the whole of the last 150 years , Japan ’s rapid industrialization and militarization , with its ethics of discipline and sacrifice , was sustained by the large majority of Zen thinkers – who , today , knows that D.T.
Suzuki himself , the high guru of Zen in the America of the 60s , supported in his youth , in Japan of the 30s , the spirit of utter discipline and militaristic expansion .
Zizek ’s conflation of Western Buddhism with otherwise Buddhism is very problematic — very much for the same reasons that conflating the writings of Nietzsche with Nazism is problematic .
By conflating Western and otherwise Buddhism he sets up a strawman argument to be uninterestingly destroyed , indicating perhaps more subtle , perverted , unconscious interests on his part , though totally ignoring the real potential of actually reading Western Buddhism not just in light of Lacan , but the teachings of the Buddha and their lineage .
This kind of reading would be very valuable , because Western Buddhism as Zizek sets it up has no coherent intellectual or spiritual ties to the Buddha ’s teachings .
In this way , it really is very different from what the Buddha taught , and effectively not the buddha - dhamma at all as some Buddhists have pointed out .
Patrick Kearney ’s “ Still Crazy after all These Years : Why Meditation is n’t Psychotherapy ” makes exactly this point , and approaches from the Buddhist perspective the same critique of what Zizek is calling Western Buddhism , although not in quite those terms .
Kearney goes a step further than Zizek though , and distances all traditions of the Buddha ’s teachings from this distinctly Western phenomenon , but to the discouraging point of practically refusing any dialogue with Western psychoanalysis or philosophy .
Western Buddhism , rather than the perfect ideological supplement to global Capitalism , which implies something about it before it co-dependently arises with the attitude of global Capitalism , has the functions as a fetishistic spectre of both Capitalism and the buddha - dhamma .
This is not much different than Zizek argues , except that this formulation should not carry any pretension of an analytic stance towards Buddhism as much the West ’s effect on it .
It also reconfigures how we appraise Western Buddhism , making way for a Buddhist critique of what from that perspective could be argued an abuse , if not sheer abandonment of the Buddha ’s teachings .
The transformation that Buddhism has undergone in the West for the last 200 has been an inversion very much like that of Nietzsche ’s Master Morality and Slave Morality .
What once were ancient , disciplined practices of meditation and monasticism matched with relatively idiosyncratic philosophies has been inverted into a relatively uniform intellectual system that seems to neither affirm nor negate any particular practice .
Ironically , the phrase “ kill the flesh to release the soul ” comes to mind , but here the soul of the buddha - dhamma is the concrete , lived practice , and the flesh that comes and goes are the philosophies and intellectualizations .
It is in this way that Zizek sees Western Buddhism coupled so well with Capitalist ideology , and why he sees it as so dangerous .
Zizek sees Christianity as much more bearable , because at least it commits itself in its “ intolerant love , ” where as Western Buddhism exacerbates a kind of libidinal paralysis already underway in the contemporary European or American , who in the 20th Century endured the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics , the cultural relativism of anthropology , the deconstruction of all meaning , the almost total simulation of appearances , and the rise of global capitalism .
This paralysis happens because the typical self - identified Buddhist in the West uncritically absorbs ideas of detachment , chakras , karma , impermanence , re-incarnation and past - lives , meditation , and non-duality from the litany of pop-psycho - therapeutic - new - age - mystic - neopagan - transpersonal - naturalist - buddhist garbage now available .
Without grounding themselves in a concrete practice , their experience of the Buddha ’s teachings is purely an intellectual affair — never dealing with the soul of the matter .
In Western Buddhism , where the ideas and not the life concerning the Buddha ’s teachings reign supreme , we encounter again ( as if we ever left ) the ascetic ideal .
In the same way that Nietzsche saw science and atheism in his time as nothing more than the up - and - coming ideological - cultural milieu expressing the ascetic ideal , Zizek ’s Western Buddhism may offer a glimpse of the new milieu to come .
What can be done now , what will be done in this essay , is an exercise in the critical engagement with the buddha - dhamma needed in the West — not to prescribe a new Western Buddhism , but to point out what is problematic about calling Western Buddhism , especially as Zizek conceives of it , a form of Buddhism at all .
This latter point will be very important , because it will open up space for something Zizek has entirely omitted from his critique of Western Buddhism : a Buddhist perspective .
To get there , a return to Nietzsche ’s distinction between active and passive nihilism will be useful , which as with Nietzsche underpin the distinction Zizek makes between Christianity and ( Western ) Buddhism , because Zizek is , without a doubt , fighting in his critique of Western Buddhism the encroaching passive nihilism , and the triumph of the reactive forces , that Nietzsche detected 100 years prior .
Nihilism : Active and Passive
“ And to repeat in the conclusion what I said in the beginning : man would rather will nothingness than not will . ”
This statement , rather cryptically , captures two senses of nihilism to be developed .
Nihilism is , in its simplest sense , as Nietzsche uses it at any rate , the negation of life and meaning .
Deleuze ( in Nietzsche and Philosophy ) suggests to avoid confusion that “ In the word nihilism nihil does not signify non-being but primarily a value of nil .
Life takes on a value of nil insofar as it is denied and depreciated . ”
The will to nothingness is relatively positive in that “ it is and remains a will ! ”
This will affirms the will , even if it negates life , which is at its bottom a “ ’ good will — a will to the actual , active denial of life . ”
This is nihilism in its active form .
Christianity and perhaps earlier Buddhism were both , Nietzsche felt , originally actively nihilistic religions ; they had goals , albeit in the form of the ascetic ideal .
Nietzsche suggests its counter - part , passive nihilism , as a radical skepticism :
For skepticism is the most spirited expression of a certain physiological condition that in ordinary language is called nervous exhaustion and sickliness ; it always develops when races or classes that have long been separated are crossed suddenly and decisively [… ]
But what becomes sickest and degenerates most in such hybrids is the will : they no longer know independence of decisions and the intrepid sense of pleasure in willing — they doubt the ‘ freedom of will ’ even in their dreams .
( Beyond Good and Evil )
Skepticism in the sense that Nietzsche uses it above is the negation of even the will to nothingness — a skepticism of the value of will .
The will is paralyzed by the absolute disbelief of and detachment from meaning .
Gilles Deleuze and Alenka Zupančič ( in The Shortest Shadow ) both suggest a relationship between the two forms of nihilism , making use of a third term reactive nihilism .
They differ in that , on the one hand , Zupančič erroneously conflates reactive and passive nihilism , particularly when she explains how reactive / passive nihilism as the will negating the will to nothingness actually gives a new life , as it were , to the will .
On the other hand , Deleuze , calling “ active nihilism ” “ negative nihilism , ” teases the two apart :
“ ’ Reactive nihilism , ’ in a way , prolongs ‘ negative nihilism ’ : triumphant reactive forces take the place of power of denying which led them to their triumph .
But ‘ passive nihilism ’ is the final outcome of reactive nihilism : fading away passively rather than being led from outside .
Deleuze argues that eventually the reactive forces ( the reactive people ) grow weary of the ebb and flow of reacting to the domination of the will to nothingness , or perhaps they grow suspicious that ultimately the will to power they ultimately affirm in that process will turn against them , and they “ break their alliance with the negative will . ”
They increase their negation of the will , and , so to speak , steal the show .
When the reactive forces win out , “ they triumph because , by separating active force from what it can do , they betray it to the will to nothingness , to a becoming - reactive deeper than themselves . ”
The reactive forces , by triumphing over the will to nothingness , effectively dominate the will , which will yield a will to something ( not - willing ) with no countering affects ; and as “ negative nihilism is replaced by reactive nihilism , reactive nihilism ends in passive nihilism . ”
It is in this sense that Nietzsche proclaims in a deceptively positive tone that
Buddhism is a religion for late human beings , for races grown kindly , gentle , over - intellectual who feel pain too easily ( — Europe is not nearly ripe for it — ) : it leads them back to peace and cheerfulness , to and ordered diet in intellectual things …
Buddhism is a religion for the end and fatigue of a civilization …
( The Anti-Christ )
As passive nihilism , Buddhism is a religion that has since gone through its reactive break with the active will to Nothingness , if it ever could have been characterized as one .
As a spiritual milieu , Buddhism is the emergence of a will to not will , which persists until it extinguishes even itself .
Hence the cheerfulness : since separating itself from affirming the will to Nothingness , the will that was at the bottom of negating that will to Nothingness becoming the total exertion of the will , Buddhism gives rise to a perverse cheerfulness , the same as would accompany the total exertion of life - affirming will .
In other words , in totally dominating the will to anything and turning it into a will to nothing ( not nothingness ) , Buddhism offers the Buddhist all the surplus - enjoyment in its excessive hold of the will .
Western Buddhism as Passive Nihilism
It is as passive nihilism that Zizek ’s Western Buddhism , and his fervent critique of it , starts to make sense .
Western Buddhism is “ a Buddhism for Europeans ” that represents , or at least encourages , the domination of the will towards a not - willing .
Zizek ’s condemns Western Buddhism for how it “ perfectly fits the fetishist mode of ideology … as opposed to its traditional symptomal mode , in which the ideological lie which structures our perceptions is threatened by symptoms qua ‘ returns of the repressed , ’ cracks in the ideological lie . ”
On the one hand , the symptomal mode of ideology is the mode of nihilism characterized by the active and reactive forces in tandem .
The symptoms are the reactive forces that come back to break - down the ideological lie or the will to Nothingness .
On the other hand , the fetishist mode is the inverse of the will to nothingness turned into , and not merely at tension with a not - willing .
Western Buddhism works as a fetish because it negates , in its domination of the affective forces , the troubling conflict in the Superego prohibition and command to enjoy .
Zupančič explains this conflict and its negation as hedonism and not asceticism , which invokes the cheerful quality of Nietzsche ’s Buddhism .
To consume sugarless sweets and decaffeinated coffee is — far from being ascetic — a hedonistic act par excellance .
It is not so very different from the proverbial Roman hedonism , where people would make themselves throw up in order to consume more food .
It is also an equivalent of ‘ how to will without ( really ) willing . ’
But , of course — and this is the whole point — this modern hedonism needs the stimulation , the excitement , of the ascetic ideal , as well as the threat that looms on its horizon ( rather Nothingness itself than .
. . ) .
It is a hedonism built upon the ascetic ideal , which is not a bad definition of passive nihilism .
( The Shortest Shadow )
Western Buddhism embodies the moral code of this hedonism , because “ our lives may well be hedonistic , but this in no way implies that they are immoral , or even ‘ beyond morality , ’ that is , ‘ beyond good and evil . ’ ”
The moral , Superego injunction is that the only appropriate way to behave is according to no principles , no morals .
This “ beyond morality ” invokes a perverse interpretation of Nietzsche ’s own phrase , which he attributed to the Buddha .
Rather than really being beyond good and evil , Western Buddhism paradoxically insists that what is good is that which is beyond good and evil .
Like the will to nothingness remaining a will , such goodness beyond good and evil is deeply moral despite its confusing appearance .
Such a morality without or beyond morals is the perfect expression of the above mentioned hedonism .
This moral stance parallels the impossible claim that we live in a so - called “ post - ideological ” era , when such a claim is itself ideological ; or more perversely , the claim that since there is nothing that is not ideological , the only non-ideological stance is to accept that there is nothing outside of ideology .
Zizek ’s critique of the post - or non-ideological claim could thus constitute a more subtle , perhaps unconscious attack of what he in other places identifies as Western Buddhism .
To invoke Nietzsche , the Western Buddhist , true to his reactive humanity , would rather have no moral values , than not be moral .
Zizek is fervently resisting this moral stance of no moral stance , this claim to a non-ideological judgment that all judgment is ideological , the “ inner distance ” or fetish that allows one to “ cancel the full impact of reality . ”
One way he is doing this is by repeatedly making the case that “ we should remain faithful to the Christian legacy of separation , of elevating some principles above others . ”
This is ironically Nietzschean of Zizek , in spite the fact he does n’t like Nietzsche .
The debate over Zizek ’s political project thus seems to have a grounding point .
He seems committed , giving prominence to active , even if nihilistic forces .
It is as if Communism was the last active force of the 20th Century , and with its fall the reactive force of Capitalism triumphed .
Thirty or forty years ago , there were still debates about what the future will be–Communism , socialism , fascism , liberal capitalism , totalitarian bureaucratic capitalism .
The idea was that life would somehow go on on earth , but that there are different possibilities .
Now we talk all the time about the end of the world , but it is much easier for us to imagine the end of the world than a small change in the political system .
( from “ The Marx Brother , ” published in The New Yorker by Rebecca Mead )
Now , as Capitalism asserts itself with no other “ one goal , ” as the reactive , will - negating forces dominate even our imagination for something different , we cheerfully resign ourselves to an ascetic hedonism for nothing .
What , however , has Buddhism to do with this resignation ?
Nihilism as Nietzsche describes and to which Zizek alludes , even if passive and “ cheerful , ” fundamentally contradicts the Buddha ’s Middle Path , the path he describes in the saṃyutta - nikāya that leads to the end of suffering through the avoidance of indulgence in sensual pleasure and “ [ giving ] oneself up to Self - mortification . ”
If this basic principle is violated , is it accurate to imply that Western Buddhism is simply the Buddha ’s teachings practiced by Westerners — what is at stake here ?
How do the extrapolated tenets and tendencies of Zizek ’s Western Buddhism compare to the teachings of the Buddha and his lineages ?
Western Buddhism under the Buddhist Lens
Characteristic of Zizek ’s Western Buddhism , and perhaps its most dangerously intoxicating quality , is a certain ambivalence and aimlessness that follow from the “ inner distance and indifference ” it teaches us .
Such aimlessness supposedly arising from the Buddha ’s teachings is quite ironic when one considers the name of the historical Buddha prior to his Awakening ( Enlightenment ) : Siddhartha , or , “ one who has achieved his aim . ”
Zizek would like us to believe that the Buddha ’s teachings compel one to throw up their arms at the demands and difficulties of life , because “ the basic premise of Buddhist ontology is that there is no ‘ objective reality ’ . ”
This is remarkably similar to Nietzsche ’s criticism of a tendency to inaction that follows from what he calls European Buddhism :
Extreme positions are not succeeded by moderate ones but by extreme positions of the opposite kind .
Thus the belief in the absolute immorality of nature , in aim - and meaninglessness , is the psychologically necessary affect once the belief in God and an essentially moral order become untenable .
Nihilism appears at that point , not that the displeasure at existence has become greater than before but because one has come to mistrust any ‘ meaning ’ in suffering , indeed in existence .
One interpretation has collapsed ; but because it was considered the interpretation it now seems as if there were no meaning at all in existence , as if everything were in vain …
This is the European form of Buddhism — doing
No after all existence has lost its ‘ meaning . ’
( The Will to Power )
What is consistent in these two views ?
Nietzsche and Zizek are both accusing Western / European Buddhism of being the “ extreme position of the opposite kind . ”
Nietzsche saw the historical period of the Buddha as being culturally similar to his own , which had grown abstract and divorced from the dogmatic , often violent beliefs and practices of the older Vedic religion of the Brahmin priests .
The Buddha taught what appeared to Nietzsche to be an opposite view of the once prevailing certainties of Vedic religion .
Zizek also sees a great switching out between East and West :
The ultimate postmodern irony is today ’s strange exchange between the West and the East .
At the very moment when , at the level of ‘ economic infrastructure , ’ Western technology and capitalism are triumphing worldwide , at the level of ‘ ideological superstructure , ’ the Judeo - Christian legacy is threatened in the West itself by the onslaught of New Age ‘ Asiatic ’ thought .
( Revenge of Global Finance )
All of these accusations of nihilism and extreme ambivalence , that there is no objective reality , are blind to the Buddha ’s own teachings against such tendencies .
His Middle Path ( Majjhimā Paṭipadā ) was a rigorous avoidance of extremes , at its most abstract : affirmation and denial of views or ideas .
‘ Bhikkhus , these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household life .
What are the two ?
There is devotion to the indulgence of sense pleasures , which is low , common , the way of ordinary people , unworthy and unprofitable ; and there is devotion to self - mortification , which is painful , unworthy and unprofitable ‘ Avoiding both these extremes , the Tathagata has realized the Middle Path : it gives vision , it gives knowledge , and it leads to calm , to insight , to enlightenment , to Nibbana .
So , as Robert Morrison and to a lesser extent Freny Mistry have made the strong case in the last 20 years , the basic charge common to Nietzsche and Zizek that the Buddha ’s teachings are nihilistic is subject to harsh criticism , if only on the basis of the Buddha ’s teachings themselves .
This is expressed by Vajjiya Mahita , a contemporary lay - student of the Buddha , when he answers questions posed to him by mendicant “ wanderers ” about the Buddha ’s teachings .
As [ Vajjiya ] was sitting there , the wanderers said to him , ‘ is it true , householder , that the contemplative Gotama criticizes all asceticism , that he categorically denounces ; disparages all ascetics who live the rough life ? ’
‘ No , venerable sirs , the Blessed One does not criticize all asceticism , nor does he categorically denounce or disparage all ascetics who live the rough life .
The Blessed One criticizes what should be criticized , and praises what should be praised .
Criticizing what should be criticized , praising what should be praised , the Blessed One is one who speaks making distinctions , not one who speaks categorically on this matter . ’
Vajjiya ’s reply to the wanderers resonates with an exchange the Buddha had with one of his most persistent critics , the wandering ascetic , Vacchagotta .
Vacchagotta asks a stock series of questions common to the philosophical milieu of the Buddha ’s time and region , probing more or less for an affirmation or denial of one of the many metaphysical theories concerning the destination of the soul upon death , the existence of the material world , the finitude or infinitude of the world , the eternality of the world , and so forth .
The Buddha plainly says no to all of Vacchagotta ’s questions , pointing out that he takes no one , categorical position on how things are , either in the affirmative or negative sense .
This sounds much like what Zizek is criticizing , but we must not forget Vajjiya ’s point that “ … the Blessed One is one who speaks making distinctions , not one who speaks categorically … ’ ”
In other words , the Buddha is not advocating throwing ones arms up when it comes to making a choice , but rather that we should always be here in the moment when a choice is to be made , making every single choice in our lives , rather than be lost in some fantasy of how things are or are not that chooses for us .
D.T. Suzuki , whom Zizek has probably never read , a trained Zen Buddhist , as well as professor of Buddhist philosophy and delightfully fluent writer and speaker of English , echoes Vajjiya when he writes about Zen as life as “ absolute affirmation . ”
We must remember , however , that we live in affirmation and not in negation , for life is affirmation itself ; and this affirmation must not be the one accompanied or conditioned by a negation , such an affirmation is relative and not at all absolute .
With such an affirmation life loses its creative originality and turns into a mechanical process grinding forth nothing but soulless flesh and bones .
To be free , life must be an absolute affirmation …
Zen does not mean a mere escape from intellectual imprisonment , which sometimes ends in sheer wantonness .
There is something in Zen that frees us from conditions and at the same time gives us a certain firm foothold …
Zen abhors repetition or imitation of any kind , for it kills .
For the same reason , Zen never explains but only affirms .
Life is fact and no explanation is necessary or pertinent .
To explain is to apologize and why should we apologize for living ?
To live — is that not enough ?
Let us then live , let us affirm .
Herein lies
Zen in all its purity and in all its nudity as well .
( An Introduction to Zen Buddhism )
The point that must not become lost is that the buddha - dhamma is all about choices , which may be summarized as Suzuki does , as the choice to affirm ( life ) .
This is one of the first things the Buddha teaches , for in avoiding extremes the Buddha means that we should avoid that which negates life , including the apparent affirmation of it in the indulgence of sensuality and / or fantasies of be ( come)ing this or that — both tendencies being at their core the expression of certain views about how things are .
This is surprisingly what Nietzsche was concerned with as well , except his favored term was the Will ( to Power ) .
When Lacan tells us “ do not concede your desire , ” he is making the same point : we have this capacity to affirm our desire or negate it , and affirming the desire of the Other ’s desire is not really our affirmation .
A story told by the Buddha in the Middle - Length Discourses may be usefully for expressing this ethical statement .
The Alagaddupama Sutta contains many stories about the appropriate view a monk should hold towards the Buddha ’s teachings .
One of them , one of the most popular in all Buddhist literature , is the raft analogy .
The Buddha compares his teachings to a raft used for crossing a great expanse of water , the further shore representing Awakening .
He instructs that as one should not drag the raft along with them once they reach the further shore , thinking that for as great as the raft was for crossing the water it must be worth keeping around and maintaining , one should also not cling to the Buddha ’s teachings ( or any view ) , for they are only means for becoming Awaken ; after which , even they must be released .
The Lacanian reading of this is obvious .
The desire that Lacan instructs us not to concede is the same desire we should properly have for reaching the further shore ; becoming attached to the raft , or the Buddha ’s teachings , is akin to giving up on our desire and seeking through something else , like the desire to have a phallus or be one for someone else .
The difference in the Buddha ’s case is that he is also suggesting that staying true to our desire will yield the satisfaction of that ( and all ) desire , whereas Lacan is less interested in what it would mean to satisfy our desire , if it is once we have properly identified it .
That is , it is precisely in this aim to properly orient our desires that the practical side of the Buddha ’s teachings appears to be the same as Lacan’s .
The analyst ’s refusal to give up his desire or knowledge as the “ subject supposed to know ” is comparable to the case in the many stories of Zen literature where a master poses to the student (s ) an impossible question , and demands a response .
Shuzan ( Shou - shan , 926-992 ) once held up his shippe to an assembly of his disciples and declared : ‘ Call this a shippe and you assert ; call it not a shippe and you negate .
Now , do not assert nor negate , and what would you call it ?
Speak , speak !’
One of the disciples came out of the ranks , took the shippe away from the master , and breaking it in two , explcained : ‘ What is this ? ’
( An Introduction to Zen Buddhism )
Rather than calling it a shippe or otherwise or being silent , which are the only desires we can imagine that the Other has in this situation , the disciple expresses his ability to act despite this otherwise paralyzing Che vois ?
This is the exact opposite of the wishy - washy , post - modern , Western Buddhist about whom Zizek is complaining .
It is not that Zizek is lying to us , that this kind of person he sees does n’t exist .
Rather , it is that Zizek is wholly mistaken in accepting the self - identification of this person , of their guiding principles at any rate , as Buddhist .
This pseudo - Buddhist is faced with the same Che vois ?
as the Zen monk by his teacher , but in the name of the very same principles that guide the monk to act the pseudo - Buddhist withdraws .
And Now For Something Completely Different
What Zizek has identified in Western Buddhism is not the Buddha ’s teachings , but the perverse lens through which Western culture is able to view the those teachings .
That lens is a spectre of the Buddha ’s teachings , which , to echo a passage from the Diamond Sutra , is perhaps why Western traditions of the Buddha ’s teaching fail to articulate their ostensible subject , the buddha - dhamma .
The Buddha then addressed Subhūti .
‘ Do not say that the Tathāgata thinks , “ I have spoken Dharma . ”
Do not say the Buddha has spoken Dharma .
I do not think like that , and you should not think that way either .
Someone who says that the Tathāgata has spoken Dharma thereby slanders the Buddha .
Such a person does not understand the Buddhadharma . ‘
‘ The Buddha spoke dharma for forty - nine years , ’ you
say .
‘ Many sūtras remain .
How can one say he did not speak Dharma ?’
Once Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva asked , ‘ Will the Buddha
please once again turn the Dharma wheel ? ”
The Buddha replied , ‘ Mañjuśrī , in forty - nine years I
have not spoken one word . ’
This impossibility of ever meeting is to be understood precisely as the same impossibility of the sexual relationship .
It is no surprise that Buddhism appears as a fantasmic spectre in the West , where masculine jouissance is predominant .
Buddhism at once promises and threatens with the Other , dark , feminine jouissance .
Buddhism is only conceivable in what Zizek might call the Western ideological matrix as this testement to its very failure to be concieved .
Zizek ’s critique of Western Buddhism , therefore , has much less to do with the teachings of the Buddha than he has made it seem , and significantly more to do with the mystical , feminine jouissance it suggests , which seems to be beyond and for that reason threatening to Zizek .

From ' gathered storms ' to reigning beauty queens
by Jeremy Hooper
Well folks , we called it .
Miss California hs signed up to become the new Florida orange juice spokesperson NOM ad star :
Miss California , Carrie Prejean , who offered memorable opposition ( above ) to same - sex marriage and a young , attractive new face for the movement against it , will appear tomorrow at a press conference hosted by the National Organization for Marriage at the National Press Club , according to a press release from the group .
She 'll be launching a new ad , the second in what the group says is a $ 1.5 million campaign .
Miss California emerges as ' opposite marriage ' spokeswoman [ Politico ]
Get your mocking caps ready , internet !
NOM ad FAIL Vol. 2 starts tomorrow !
**SEE ALSO : Carrie is at the uber - anti-gay Liberty University today , further cashing in on her oh - so - learned assessment of " opposite marriage " :
Your thoughts
Never thought I 'd be looking forward to shameless , hateful propaganda , but I can't wait to see how bad this one is .
Posted by : ZJ | Apr 29 , 2009 2:16:25 PM
Hopefully , they 'll keep spending money putting out dumb ads that everyone can lampoon until they eventually go bankrupt .
Posted by : Jon | Apr 29 , 2009 2:36:58 PM
If Prejean is as inarticulate in the NOM ad as she was answering " that question " , then the this one ( or at least the leaked out - takes ) should be pretty entertaining .
But at least she will be able to use those newly implanted fake boobies for Jesus !
Gotta get some mileage out of 'em !
I think that they should have the lightning strike her in this one !
Maybe causing one ( or both ) of those implants to explode !
How cool would that be ?
Posted by : Dick Mills | Apr 29 , 2009 2:50:24 PM
I want to find out if Michael Phelps is fucking this stupid bitch .
Posted by : Frank | Apr 29 , 2009 2:58:26 PM
Methinks Prejean needs a good pie in the face .
Posted by : RainbowPhoenix | Apr 29 , 2009 2:59:05 PM
If the pageant didnt ask her this question we wouldnt of had this situation .
I think we should stay away from issues like this in the Miss USA pageant event .
However
Id like to see Miss California to be lampooned by any drag queen with comedic flair .
Posted by : Matt from California | Apr 29 , 2009 3:20:24 PM
Liberty University ?
Anti-gay ?
As an insitution , yes .
But hon , I do n't even go to LU and I still run out of fingers when I try to count the number of queens I know there .
Posted by : Harrison | Apr 29 , 2009 4:14:01 PM
I tried to defend this failure on the basis of freedom of speech , and the fact that Perez Hilton does not represent any sentiment of the gay community I want to be associated with .
But then she had to go and do this .
Posted by : Chris | Apr 29 , 2009 4:47:03 PM
NOM should want Miss Prejean as their representative as much as most in the gay community want Perez Hilton as their representative !
Sheesh !
Posted by : KZ | Apr 29 , 2009 5:05:57 PM
Let 's not be so quick to kick this development aside BEFORE the ad comes out tomorrow .
Jeremy 's link gives the language of the ad .
To me , it does n't make any sense and furthers the silly " they are calling us bigots for trying perserve traditional marriage " distraction that Maggie Gallagher is constantly trying to push .
Posted by : a. mcewen | Apr 29 , 2009 5:28:50 PM
One more thing - I think the ad has footage from the pageant .
Ca n't NOM get into trouble with pageant officials regarding copyright ?
Posted by : a. mcewen | Apr 29 , 2009 5:30:00 PM
I 'm frightened , but I have faith that my gay peeps will ensure that a witty and stinging parody will come from this !
Posted by : @Daniel_Baylis | Apr 29 , 2009 5:38:19 PM
Chris : I 'm with you .
On Friday night , when I saw her on CNN , I really thought she was going to downplay this .
She was working the " I have the same position as Obama " angle , and I really thought that her whirlwind week had given her insight into who she does n't want to be .
I really thought she would reject these calls to become the new Anita B .
And I said as much .
But this week , it has gotten worse and worse .
She is not only going along with it -- she is courting it .
It 's as if she 's hired an agent to seek out these offers in particular .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Apr 29 , 2009 6:03:53 PM
Gee , I can't say that I think she should be making adds for or against gay marriage , but that having been said .
All those that exploited her and her answer have made money off of it .
First of all , it is n't news .
She spoke freely about her opinion .
No laws broken there .
She was n't even insulting to anyone .
The only ones that took offense are the PC people and who really cares .
She did not make a big deal out of her answer , Perez did and the press did .
I do n't believe in gay " marriage " and the reason I do n't is that it goes against MY religious beliefs .
You cannot , nor should you want tp. take that right away from me .
That being said , I believe that Gay Couples deserve every legal right that any heterosexual couple has .
I believe they should be able to own property , make contracts , be each other 's health care providers , have first right to medical information etc .
I just oppose the use of the word " marriage " .
It just grates on me because to me that is a Sacrament and is given in my bible .
It means the joining of one man and one woman for the purpose of procreation to me .
That is my belief .
If we could have intelligent conversation about this , the issue would go away .
But I believe that the left leaners in this country do n't want it to go away .
They would prefer to call me names and take make my beliefs less important than theres .
Therefore , this issue will never bring us together .
It is sad , because I love my Gay friends very much and would rather solve the problem than to call each other names over it .
Posted by : Bette Lewis | Apr 30 , 2009 10:54:22 AM
Bette : Nobody is trying to take away you , or Ms. Prejean 's , right to oppose marriage equality .
This is not about the options religious sacrament , which will still be left to the churches .
This is about the CIVIL marriage contract -- the one that everyone needs to have a legally - binding marriage , regardless of whether or not the opt for faith blessing .
Period .
No gay activist -- I repeat , * NO * gay activist -- is seeking forced religious ceremony .
And the " name - calling " is a straw man .
There are people on both sides who made , unfortunately , resort to name - calling .
But the core of this debate is fair and reasoned , with our side coming out on top .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Apr 30 , 2009 11:19:42 AM
Carrie , you are a sore loser .
Stop trying to get 15 more minutes of fame for your wanting to have only marriage for heterosexuals .
Marriage should be for everyone who is within the age of consent .
Hope you lose your crown like others have because of your racy pictures you had taken when you were 17 .

It is cost rather than privacy concerns that will save us from Labour 's megalomaniac surveillance schemes – a point underlined this morning when David Cameron was interviewed on the Today programme .
With the vast choice of public expenditure open to him , he would single out only the identity card scheme and the children 's database ContactPoint as definite targets for immediate cuts .
There are many more savings to be made .
Earlier this year , I and a couple of researchers started to calculate the costs of the database state and came up with a total of about £ 35 bn from published figures .
The Rowntree Trust followed with a report that claimed that £ 16bn was spent each year on IT schemes and that spending plans over the next five years amounted to £ 100bn .
So we are talking very big figures indeed , although no one really knows how much the surveillance state will cost .
When you confront civil servants like Sir David Varney who is in charge of the transformational government project , which will make all information about individuals available to all departments and agencies , they say that the savings will pay for the scheme .
But recent investigations by the Times and Computer Weekly showed that the overrun on large - scale IT projects totals £ 18.6 bn .
For instance , the cost of the NHS Spine – a controversial plan to computerise all patients ' records – has risen from £ 2.3 bn in three years to £ 12.7bn , and the system still is not working .
Here are some figures :
ContactPoint
The projected cost of the database , which will contain the personal details of every child of school age in the UK , is £ 224 m with operating costs of £ 41 m per annum over 10 years .
The total cost of ContactPoint is £ 634m .
ID Cards and national identity register
A report in June 2005 from the London School of Economics predicted that the ID card scheme would cost in total between £ 10.6bn and £ 19.2 bn over 10 years .
The original Home Office estimate was £ 3.1 bn .
The official figure was revised up and down to £ 5.4bn and £ 4.5 bn .
The difficulty with the ID card scheme is working what the Home Office has passed on to other ministries and what costs it is hiding .
Most estimates outside the government believe the final bill to be somewhere between £ 10bn and £ 11bn .
e-Borders
The e-Borders scheme will monitor everyone crossing UK borders .
Those leaving the country will be expected to supply up to 53 pieces of information to the government .
The estimated cost over the next decade is £ 1.2 bn .
Costs to the UK travel industry for the same period , which are expected to be passed onto the travelling public , are £ 360 m .
Therefore costs to the taxpayer and indirectly to the public equal about £ 1.5 bn .
Again this is unlikely to be the final story , especially when you consider that £ 650 m alone was earmarked for the Raytheon Systems over the next 10 years .
As yet there is no publicised estimate for the spy centre at Wythenshawe , which will track all our movements .
Known costs are about £ 1.5 bn .
Interception modernisation programme
Proposed in the communications data bill , the IMP will store data from every text , phone call , email and internet connection .
The costs of the data silo are estimated at £ 12bn , although the Home Office has suggested it might be run in the private sector .
Experience suggests this is unlikely to cut costs and that the security of the system would be compromised .
Estimated cost : £ 12bn .
Automatic number recognition camera network
This system tracks , records and stores the details of all journeys undertaken on major roads and through city centres .
The information is stored for five years .
In 2007 this was said to have costs £ 32.5 bn in funding with a further £ 10 m since then ; a total of £ 2 m per annum is spent .
The final bill over five years is £ 52 m .
NHS spine
This is a computerised system linking health records .
Estimated cost : £ 12.2bn .
Some important points : first , a lot of this money is being spent with foreign systems companies ; second , the government has never produced a global figure for the surveillance state ; third , there are no estimates of the vast amounts of money being wasted locally , for instance on CCTV schemes , which are held by police officers and the House of Lords to have little effect on crime reduction .
If people with knowledge of the economics of surveillance are reading this , they may like to help to refine the bill .
At any given time , there are about 8 - 10 sure - thing , bankable action stars in Hollywood .
These are actors that directors and producers can cast into any role , and they are guaranteed a varied level of success – even if the film ends up being bad .
Then , there are the other actors that pursue roles in action films ; they are actors that typically started out in comedy , athletes trying to break into movies , and of course , the B movie guys .
The worst , we believe , are listed below .
They are the worst twenty action film stars of all time .
Jay Leno- Collision Course
After 17 years of hosting The Tonight Show , Jay Leno became a household name .
But before he took over duties from Johnny Carson , he was just another actor / comedian .
And in 1989 he stared in the action flop Collision Course .
The movie was pitched in the same vein as Beverly Hills Cop , but unlike Murphy , Leno was not as funny on the silver screen as he was off .
And thankfully he has since stayed off .
Worst One - liner : “ I ’m gonna bust your ass ! ”
Brigette Neilson – Red Sonja
During the Reagan Era , Hollywood seemed to jones for big budget action flicks .
The studios did n’t spare any expense when they green lit Red Sonya .
Back in the day Brigette Neilson was kick ass hot , but never kick ass .
She played a better uptight Russian wife , than she did a kick ass medieval mistress .
Worst One - liner : “ No man may have me unless he ’s beaten me in a fair fight . ”
Bruce Li – Everything He Ever Did
There was an obvious void in Hollywood when Bruce Lee died .
To fill that void , certain studio executives decided to release Karate movies with action star Bruce Li .
To say the least , the Brucesplotation did n’t last , and Li went back to his first dream , being a P.E. teacher .
Worst One-liner : “ WAAAAAAAAA ! ”
Halle Berry – Catwoman
Halle Berry is hot , and Halle Berry is even a decent actress .
But what Halle Berry is not is an action star .
She has an affinity for playing comic characters , or sunbathing topless ( Swordfish ) ; Berry is best suited for roles where she is not wearing a fitted leather costume with strategically placed tears in it .
Worst One - liner : “ White Russian , no ice , no vodka… hold the Kahlua . ”
Steve Austin – What Was The Movie Called Again ?
For some reason , big white guys on steroids think they can perfect their acting skills in the WWE .
Steve Austin is no exception .
Worst One - liner : “ Sounds like you ’ve had a hard life … good thing it ’s over ! ”
Corey Haim – Prayer For The Rollerboys
By 1991 , Corey Haim was on the decline , and rollerblades were on their way to mainstream success .
And for some reason , a team of producers got together and thought Haim would be a good fit for the rollerblade - apocalypse movie known as Prayer for the Rollerboys .
Haim starred as a kid who helps a gang of ‘ bladers save the world .
This film simply should not have been created – ever .
Worst One - liner : “ Speedbagger …
Do n’t hate me . ”
Dolph Lundgren - Universal Soldier Franchise
Everyone knows that Rocky IV was awesome , and to this day I still think of Dolph Lundgren as a Soviet boxer .
But , unfortunately for everyone , this guy continued to put out Universal Solider movies .
There were 6 Universal Soldier movies from 1992 to 2012 , and if you have seen one , you have seen them all – quite possibly the worst action film franchise of all time .
Worst One - liner : “ Dying is easy , rock n roll is hard . ”
George Clooney - Batman & Robin
There ’s no doubt that George Clooney is a wildly successful actor - producer , but nothing can redeem his performance in Batman & Robin .
Some blame Joel Schumaker , others blame the synthetic rubber suit , I just blame the casting director .
Clooney is just too pretty to act in a rubber suit .
It just was n’t believable , and frankly , the only good thing to come from this movie was the Smashing Pumpkins opener and closer on the soundtrack .
Worst One - liner : “ This is why Superman works alone . ”
John Cena- The Marine
What do you get when you put a rapping wrestler in a big - budget action film ?
Alabama box office gold !
Alabama and Tennessee are about the only place this movie did well .
Furthermore , I understand it ’s important to blow crap up in movies , but when there are more explosions than lines , you can tell the director is trying to hide the fact that his star ca n’t act .
Worst One - liner : “ You married a marine , Kate . ”
Shaq – Steel
Shaq can dunk a basketball , Shaq can block a shot , and Shaq can even get a master ’s degree , ( University of Phoenix ) but one thing ’s for sure –
Shaq ca n’t act !
When Shaq broke onto the NBA scene , Hollywood came knocking on his giant door .
Hoping to match his success on the court with box office bucks , Shaq starred in a string of terrible kid-friendly action flicks .
When people see his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame one day , hopefully , they ’ll be able to forget his terrible excuse for an acting career .
Worst One- liner : “ Man , Metal , STEEL ! ”
Martin Lawrence – Bad Boys I & II
Martin Lawrence was awesome on TV and as a comic .
But being entirely honest , we ’d rather see him act in drag than in action movies .
Will Smith truly carried Bad Boys I & II , as Martin Lawrence was more like an annoying backseat driver than a believable cop .
Worst One - liner : “ Damn , it ’s the niggras ! ”
Brendan Fraser – Tarzan
To be honest , playing a thawed - out cave man showed the extent of Fraser ’s acting talent .
Since Encino Man , however , he has n’t made much progress in the talent department .
That ’s not to say his movies are n’t entertaining , because they are .
But the fact remains , CGI effects can never replace someone ’s ability to act or lack thereof .
Or their hair .
Worst One- liner : “ Gazangas ! ”
Nicholas Cage – The Rock
You got to admit , Nicholas Cage carries himself pretty well for a man wearing hair plugs .
But just because he carries himself well does n’t mean he can perform in action films .
Enjoying the fruits of nepotism since his start in the early 1980s , Cage ( Coppola ) peaked early with his performance as a drunk in Leaving Las Vegas .
It was n’t until Cage was cast in The Rock with Sean Connery that he began this action hero bit .
Since then it seems
Cage has released at least one crappy action film per year .
Nicholas
Cage should have stuck to the roles that allowed him to display his true talent as the town drunk that he actually is .
Worst One - liner : “ I love pressure .
I eat it for breakfast . ”
Hulk Hogan – Suburban Commando , and Everything Else
Anyone remember wrestling buddies ?
Those things were awesome , and if we ’re honest , wrestling buddies have about as much acting talent as Hulk Hogan .
Given , his target audience was pre-pubescent kids , his acting skills were about as convincing as Uncle Jesse playing an E.R. doctor .
Although Hulk Hogan remains one of the most famous and highest grossing wrestlers of all time , his lack of talent for acting remains hideously obvious .
Worst One - liner : “ I WON ’T be around when this check clears ! ”
Gary Sinise – Imposter
No offense against Gary Sinise , but he ’s a better Lt. Dan than he is a leading man .
In 2001 , Sinise was cast as the lead in a sci- fi action thriller , Imposter .
You can tell the studio that made this mistake did n’t have high hopes for it since they released it in mid-January 2002 .
The only thing that could have made this movie better ( worse ? ) is if Val Kilmer was cast as the lead .
Worst One - liner : “ Only two things are infinite : the universe and human stupidity ; and I ’m not sure about the universe . ”
Steven Segal - Everything He ’s Ever Done ( A lot )
When I think of Steven Segal the first thing that pops into my head is the random boob shots that always appear in all of his movies .
Anyway , this guy is known more for his quick fighting hands than he is for his acting range .
Despite the fact that he is elderly , he is continuing to keep the B-rated , low - budget , action genre alive .
Worst One - liner : [ after crushing some guys skull ]
“ Take some aspirin for that headache ! ”
John Stamos – Born To Ride
There ’s a reason Uncle Jessie has been a TV star his entire career , three words , Born to Ride .
The plot for the movie is : the Army decides to modernize its horse driven cavalry to motorcycles , and apparently this pisses off Stamos ’ character .
That ’s about it .
To emphasize Stamos ’ character ’s distain , the movies tag line reads , “ He was born to break the rules . ”
Worst One - liner : “ Not the hair , C’mon . ”
Triple H – Blade : Trinity
The first two Blade movies were pretty good , and through these films , Wesley Snipes proved he could play a badass vampire slayer .
Then Blade : Trinity came out and Triple H from the WWE played a vampire vigilante in pursuit of Blade .
Not even the awesomeness of Snipes could redeem H’s performance in this piece of douchebag snuff .
Needless to say , this was Triple H’s one and only stab at the big screen , and boy did he suck … sorry , cheap laugh !
Worst One - liner : “ Hey , dick - face .
You seen my dog ? ”
Jennifer Garner - Elektra
Now I understand there are plenty of Alias fans out there that love Jenifer Garner , but did you see the fifth season ?
And did you see the movies in which she played Elektra ?
She may be the ultimate kick ass fan boy fantasy , but that in no means qualifies her to be an action star .
And to make matters worse she married and started a family with one of the biggest douches in Hollywood , Ben Affleck .
Worst One - liner : “ Do n’t worry .
Death ’s not that bad . ”
Vanilla Ice – Cool As Ice
I am convinced no one in the history of super celebrity rose or fell as fast as Vanilla Ice .
People could n’t get enough of this guy , and then all of a sudden they hated his guts .
I kind of feel sorry for the bastard .
Truth is though , this guy ca n’t act or rhyme worth crap , and once his sexy hot whiteness appeal wore off , the public was done .
Seems that his terrible motorcycle action movie Cool As Ice , was what kick - started his decline , and for good reason .
I believe this movie was only out in theaters for a weekend , and it tanked .
Worst One- liners : “ Yeah , whackhead tried to play baseball with my homeboy ’s bike ! ”
“ Drop that zero and get with the hero ! ”
“ I ’m gonna go across the street and , uh , schling a schlong . ”
“ Looky , looky in Kat ’s black booky . ”
“ You ’re not wasting my time , I ’m just cooling . ”

OTTAWA – Canada 's Olympic athletes will be wearing seal skin on their 2010 uniforms to protest an international ban on the product – that is , if the country 's parliamentarians have their way .
The federal Parliament voted Wednesday to use the Vancouver Games to protest a European Union ban on seal products .
Parliamentarians from all parties agreed unanimously to a motion from the Bloc Quebecois that says the Games should be used to promote products from the seal hunt .
The motion suggests one possibility : that Canada 's Olympic uniform include at least one seal product , likely skin .
Fisheries Minister Gail Shea applauded the idea , while wondering whether it might be too late .
" I would imagine the Olympic clothing is all designed and probably made by now , " Shea said .
" But I think it 's a good symbolic suggestion – to add something to the outfit of our athletes .
I think it would be a good statement for the Canadian sealing industry , and Canada 's support of it . "
Parliamentary motions are non-binding on either the government or the Canadian Olympic Committee , but are an expression of the will of Canada 's elected politicians .
The European Parliament voted massively in favour of a seal ban , which could have a dramatic impact on Canadian hunters and exporters .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said he does not want the ban to scuttle separate talks on Canada - EU free trade .
But Canadian lawyers are already considering a legal challenge , while the EU council of ministers considers whether to implement the ban .
Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe said the Canadian government was outmanoeuvred on the public - relations front and that it should have been more aggressive defending the seal hunt .
Duceppe singled out one country that had no business lecturing Canada on animal rights : Spain , where fights with bulls in front of cheering spectators is a national sport .
" I find it completely abnormal to see protests ( against the seal hunt ) in Spain – the country that holds the bullfights , " Duceppe said .
" We need a campaign .
Our adversaries conducted one heck of a campaign , and Canada did not conduct a major one on the promotional level .
...
" The Olympics are n't a trivial thing .
We could use this event to shed light on this , but we need to use other events , too . "

Duceppe shot back at one questioner who asked whether Olympic athletes might bristle at the idea of being forced to wear animal pelts to make a political statement .
" I do n't know what my shoes are made of – but if they 're not made out of plastic , they 're not made out of straw , they come from an animal . "

Review of Iron Man MK III
Sixth Scale Action Figure Hot Toys

Introduction
It 's taken forever - or at least it seems that way to me - but I finally received my Hot Toys Iron Man Mark III sixth scale action figure from Sideshow .
As you might expect , I have the MKII and MKI suits on pre-order as well .
Hot Toys first started shipping these to various international retailers back in February , but Sideshow ( the official US distributor ) just started sending out their orders in the last couple weeks .
As you 'd expect ( this is a Hot Toys figure after all ) , he 's not cheap .
He runs anywhere from $ 140 - $ 180 , depending on the retailer , and most places are in the $ 160 range .
I do have several sponsors that are carrying him , and one is below $ 150 !
UPDATE : The Mark II is now shipping , and I have my review up as well !
Packaging - ****
Wow .
This is easily the coolest package I 've ever seen .
It 's similar to Sideshow 's Star Wars packaging , because it uses magnetic closures and wraps around the box .
But Sideshow 's only wraps around the two sides and the front - this cover wraps around the box entirely !
That means you get a full inside panel the size of both the front and back of the box , along with both narrow sides .
There 's a ton of text and photos included , and it's a fantastic presentation .
On the center of the front cover is a die cut hole , which allows the silver chest symbol to stick through .
This symbol is then incorporated both in the open and closed appearance of the package .
Oh , and it pretty much goes without saying that it 's completely collector friendly .
No tape , no twisties , no string , no rubber bands - absolutely nothing to stop you from opening it up , taking it out , and returning it later without any damage at all to this beautiful box .
Sculpting - ****
If you own either the Hot Toys Endoskeleton or the Robocop , you know what amazing engineering feats Hot Toys is able to pull off .
As good as though two figures are , the articulation and design of this outfit is even more amazing .
The armor is sculpted to work with the various joints extremely well , and yet looks just like the on screen version .
He suffers from the one issue all Iron Man figures do - he 's a tad skinny for a guy wearing a suit like this over his body - but the detail and quality is so outstanding , that I 'm more than willing to over look it that relatively minor issue .
One reason it is relatively minor is that the internal proportions are so well done .
The head to body , arms and legs to torso , hand and foot size , and other ratios all are just about dead on and extremely realistic .
The smooth metallic look of the suit is broken up by small rivets , plates and screws .
There are opening panels on his forearms that expose the small rockets , as well as panels on the back of his calves that show off the internal pistons and mechanics .
The detail work here is amazing , and I 've included a close up of the calf to show the extreme detail , right down to the tiny sculpted wires .
They 've included a second head sculpt of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark .
The realism of the work , much like their other recent releases , is downright scary .
The textured skin , subtle facial hair , and realistic eyes are a sight to see .
I will admit though that the likeness to Downey is off * slightly * .
It 's mostly the nose that 's throwing it a bit for me , but this is a very minor issue .
Paint - ***1/2
The quality of the paint work on the armor is top notch , with no slop , no bleed , and no poor cut lines .
Most impressive are the small details , particularly the hidden wiring and pistons under the movable panels .
The color seems a bit off to me though , hence the slight drop in score .
The red is very dark , darker than it appears in photos .
It should be darker than say , a candy apple red , but I compared it to the 1:1 prop replica helmet red and it 's still a bit darker .
EDIT : One of my readers ( Thanks , Andrew ! ) has one of the cool Rittenhouse Archives trading cards that has a piece of the actual suit embedded in it .
He thought the Hot Toys suit was a bit dark to until he compared them , but they are actually dead on .
Score one for Hot Toys , zero for those of us with less than perfect color vision .
Articulation - ****
There 's so much articulation here , and so much of it is unique , that it 's almost impossible to explain it all .
The easy joint is the ball jointed neck .
The movement is pretty good , although I could n't get it quite as far back as Jeff Parker did in his review photos .
The very last photo at the bottom of the page shows him in a flying pose resting on the included display stand , and as you can see , I could n't quite get the neck back far enough .
But since Jeff had better luck , your mileage may vary .
The shoulders are complex pin/ post ball joints with articulation on both sides of the ball that allow for a tremendous range of movement .
The shoulder armor is also articulated , both where it attaches to the shoulder , and at the mid-point where the two pieces of shoulder armor attach to each other !
Pin joints like these utilize metal pins , rather than plastic , to make them even more sturdy .
The elbows are single pin , and the wrists are basic ball / socket ball joints , but the elbows have such a wide range of movement , that this is enough for just about any arm pose .
Because of the light up feature , there 's no waist or ab - crunch joint , which is the only real limiting factor on the overall body .
But because the light up feature works so well and looks so good , it 's a sacrifice I 'm willing to make .
EDIT : I have it on good authority that it is possible to move the ab and waist joints ... but I 'd be really , really careful doing it .
Mine are stuck solid , and I do n't want to risk damaging him .
The hips are excellent ball joints , and the ball rotates both in the pelvis , and in the thigh .
They are clicky style joints too , which helps lock them into place .
The knees might appear to be single pin at first , but they are actually a fairly unique type of joint where a section of knee is actually buried in the leg .
As you move the knee , this section is exposed , making it possible for the leg to move quite a way backwards but maintaining a terrific look .
Perhaps the best joint system in the whole body is the ankles .
These are very complex .
There 's a swivel joint that allows the foot to move side to side and back and forth , so that the foot remains flat on the floor in even deep stances .
There 's also a half foot joint , and the various armor flaps that hang down around the foot are jointed to allow them to move up out of the way .
While it is not typical articulation , there are also flaps that open on the back for flight , as well as flaps on the forearms that open to lift up the rocket launchers , and flaps on the calves that expose the interior pistons .
Be careful with these , as they are more delicate than the other joints .
The level of articulation here is amazing , and almost all of it is extremely well hidden .
It 's truly an outstanding piece of engineering , the likes of which you rarely see in toys or collectibles , even in this price range .
Accessories - ***1/2
I mentioned the additional Tony Stark head in both the sculpt and paint sections , but it 's also a big reason for the good score here .
Getting the extra head sculpt really adds a lot to a character like this , since now it 's quite easy to pick up an extra True - Type body ( around $ 25 - $ 30 ) , grab a suit from someplace like Triad Toys ( around $ 40 ) , and you have yourself a great looking Tony Stark on the shelf next to your Iron Man .
He also has two extra sets of hands , above and beyond the fists he comes wearing .
Both of these sets are open , with light up palms .
One set has the fingers splayed wide , while the other set has them curled in slightly .
The head and hands swap extremely easily .
Because of the light up feature , the posts are a permanent part of the body , and are much thicker and sturdier than usual .
Of course , it means that the head and hands are n't quite as articulated , but I mentioned that in the previous section .
Light Feature - ****
Iron Man lights ' up with bright LED lights at four locations - eyes , chest , and both palms .
These four locations are controlled by three switches .
There 's a small switch ( very small , but very sturdy ) on each forearm for the palm lights , and there is an equally tiny switch on his back under the his left flap that controls the light for both the eyes and chest .
The various areas light up via plastic ' tubes ' that carry the bright light to the respective spots .
Since the hands and head are removable , these tubes are the actual posts that they fit over .
The lights are very bright , and very even .
What impresses me is that even though they are very bright , there 's no spill around the joints .
For example , none of the light that illuminates the eyes spills out around the neck .
The lights look terrific , even in normal room lighting , and add quite a bit of value to this expensive figure .
Outfit - N /
A
Unlike most HT sixth scale figures , there 's no actual costume here .
The body is sculpted plastic , and while the various flaps and panels open , nothing comes off .
Fun Factor - ***
I might be a little generous here , since this is n't a toy .
Not at all , not by any stretch of the imagination .
You should pose and manipulate him with extreme care .
He 's not going to fall apart in your hands , but there are tiny parts , hinges and clips that can be broken with a heavy hand .
But he 's still damn fun , even if you are n't a kid .
If you are looking for something in this scale for your eight year old , go with the Repulsor Iron Man instead .
He 's not great , but really the only available IM in this scale right now .
Value - **1/2
Yep , he 's expensive - but there 's plenty of good reasons for it .
He 's an amazing piece of engineering , much like their earlier Endoskeleton and Robocop .
Oh , you are n't going to feel like you got a deal , but you wo n't feel like you overspent either .
Things to Watch Out For -
The joints seem very sturdy , and the heads and hands swap easily , so there should be no issues there .
But the small pins and plastic flaps on the back , forearms , and calves are a bit more fragile , and I managed to break one of the two flaps on the back of his ankle .
So take some care when opening and closing them , or when positioning the feet .
Overall - ****
If you 're looking to take my Best of 2009 in the 12 " - 18 " range , then you 're looking at the figure you have to beat .
That 's not to say that there are n't some contenders coming this year - including Hot Toys Hellboy - but it 's not going to be easy to take the spot from this guy .
Then again , I like the look of the Mark II suit from the film even better than the Mark III , so maybe he 'll be beat by his own predecessor !
The articulation , sculpt , and light up feature are outstanding , and even though he's not cheap , you 're getting your money 's worth .
Score Recap ( out of **** ) :
Packaging - ****
Sculpting - ****
Paint - ***1/2
Articulation - ****
Accessories - ***1/2
Light Up Feature - ****
Fun Factor - ***
Value - **1/2
Overall - ****

President Obama , rejecting former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s contention that Obama has put the nation at greater risk of terrorism , suggests in an interview airing tonight on “ 60 Minutes ” that the previous administration ’s stance was an “ advertisement for anti-American sentiment . ”
“ How many terrorists have actually been brought to justice under the philosophy that is being promoted by Vice President Cheney ? ” Obama asks .
“ It has n’t made us safer .
What it has been is a great advertisement for anti-American sentiment . ”
The “ 60 Minutes ” interview is Obama ’s longest since taking office , CBS says .
The interview was edited down from a 90 - minute session taped Friday evening .
The president also defends Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner against growing criticism of the government ’s handling of the financial crisis .
If Geithner were to try to resign , Obama said , the president would tell him : “ Sorry , buddy , you ’ve still got the job . ”

Cheney , who has been outspoken in his criticism of the Obama administration , said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” last Sunday that Obama has increased the nation ’s risk of terrorist attacks by jettisoning key elements of the Bush administration ’s aggressive approach .
Since taking office , Obama has announced plans to close the Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , detention facility ; banned waterboarding ; ordered the closure of secret interrogation sites ; and ordered CIA interrogators to abide by rules in the Army Field Manual .
“ Now he is making some choices that , in my mind , will , in fact , raise the risk to the American people of another attack , Cheney said of Obama .
President Bush has shied away from criticizing his successor , explaining in Calgary , Canada , on Tuesday during his first paid speech since leaving office that Obama “ deserves my silence . ”

Asked by CBS ’ Steve Kroft about releasing prisoners who have returned to terrorist groups , Obama replies : “ There is no doubt that we have not done a particularly effective job in sorting through who are truly dangerous individuals . . . to make sure [ they ] are not a threat to us . ”
Yet , the president maintains , the Bush administration ’s policy on detainees at Guantanamo -- including long incarcerations without trial -- was “ unsustainable . ”
In the interview , Obama also addresses the economy , the proposed 90 % tax on bonuses for top officials working at bailed - out firms , healthcare , carmaker bailouts , Afghanistan and Pakistan , CBS says .
The president says that neither he nor Geithner has mentioned resignation from his Treasury post , according to CBS , and that criticism is natural , considering the circumstances of the economy .

“ It ’s going to take a little bit more time than we would like to make sure that we get this plan just right , ” Obama says .
“ Of course , then we ’d still be subject to criticism -- ‘ What ’s taken so long ?
You ’ve been in office a whole 40 days and you have n’t solved the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression . ’ ”
Obama was asked about grumbling from Wall Street because the administration criticized bonuses for executives at financial institutions collecting government bailouts .
“ They need to spend a little time outside of New York .
Because . . . if you go to North Dakota , or you go to Iowa , or you go to Arkansas , where folks would be thrilled to be making $ 75,000 a year -- without a bonus -- then I think they ’d get a sense of why people are frustrated . ”

The current Swine Flu pandemic headlines read like those flashing through the intro sequence of a post - apocalyptical movie .
Now you can see the cases spreading in real time — as the WHO declares them — in Google Maps .

In case you have not been paying attention to the news during the last few days , there 's a pandemia going on .
A spike of infections of the H1N1 Swine Flu—a mutation of a pork virus that jumped from pigs to humans — happened in the city of Mexico ( 103 dead already ) and it is quickly spreading through the world now , thanks to airline connections .
Reading the map is very simple :
We are all going to die
The pink markers are suspect , the purple markers are confirmed , and deaths do n't have a black dot in the marker .
The yellow markers are negative , but I do n't see any .

Last week , I had one of those clarifying moments when the enormity of the American fiasco stirred my livers and lights again .
I was riding in a car at sundown between St. Cloud and Minneapolis on I - 94 through a fifty - mile - plus corridor of bargain shopping infrastructure on each side of the highway .
The largest automobile dealerships I have ever seen lay across the edge of the prairie like so many UFO landing strips , with eerie forests of sodium - vapor lamps shining down on the inventory .
The brightly colored signs of the national chain fried food parlors vied for supremacy of the horizon with the big box logos .
The opposite lane was a blinding river of light as the cars plied north from the Twin Cities to these distant suburbs in the pre-Thanksgiving rush hour .
All that tragic stuff deployed out on the prairie was but the visible part of the storm now being perfected for us .
On the radio , Iraq was coming completely apart and with it the illusion of America being able to control a larger set of global events -- with dire implications for all glowing plastic crap along the interstates , and the real - live people behind the headlights in those rivers of cars .
The main fresh impression I had amidst all this is how over it is .
The glowing smear of auto - oriented commerce along I - 94 ( visible from space , no doubt ) had the look of being finished twenty minutes ago .
Beyond the glowing logos lay the brand new residential subdivisions full of houses that now may never be sold , put up by a home - building industry in such awful trouble that it may soon cease to exist .
If suburbia was the Great Work of the American ethos , then our work is done .
We perfected it , we completed it , and , like a brand new car five minutes after delivery , it has already lost much of its value .
The chief failure in American politics lately has been the inability to appreciate the relationship between how we live here and how other people in other lands support us with their resources -- oil from the Middle East , human labor and money saved from the fruits of human labor from the Far East .
The oil obviously runs all the cars and the money from China and Japan supports our debt ( and incidentally pays for building ever more big box stores and fried food emporia ) .
The Middle East is now so close to exploding that we may not get so much oil from them in the years ahead .
China and Japan have stepped back from buying American debt in the form of US Treasury certificates .
Even if there were no exogenous forces operating , the proverbial Man-From - Mars casual observer would have to conclude that America has built all the shopping venues it will ever need ( and far beyond ) , and certainly more single - family housing subdivisions useful only in a happy motoring meta-system .
But the exogenous events are out there and they are going to assert their power to make us uncomfortable and to alienate us from the very stuff that we have poured all of our wealth and spirit into .
The New York Times headlined yesterday that the US government might try to start negotiations with Iran and Syria over the fate of Iraq -- an idea so preposterous that it might have been a wire - story from The Onion .
Iran and Syria have no interest in the matter whatsoever except in the failure of America to control events , and the humiliation entailed by that failure , which is happening on its own .
So the story is a clear signal of our desperation that we are even pretending to make overtures .
For the US military this is a tragedy of classical Greek dimensions , a playing out of implacable forces despite its heroism or even good intentions .
But for the American public , back home , enjoying the bright lights of the WalMarts and the steaming heaps of baby back ribs , and the comfort of the ride home with the latte plugged into the cup holder and Jay - Z's inspirational thoughts playing on the car stereo -- it 's really the end of the road .
I 've been saying for a long time that as our illusions dropped away , the US economy would fall on its face .
I think the process is underway , especially with last week 's movement of the dollar against the Euro .
All the elements are now set for a full - throttle depression in which currency loses value while credit dries up and incomes are lost .
You get a fire - sale of assets that behaves like a deflation while the dollar itself inflates .
The Federal reserve can't possibly drop interest rates if foreigners will not buy our bonds .
Losing your house to the repo man is a major illusion - breaker .
The housing bubble has popped and entered a downward self - reinforcing feedback loop that will be understood as a death - spiral of valuation .
Even if nominal house prices stayed close to where they are , dollar inflation would signify a real drop in value .
The jobs associated with the bubble -- everything from the legions of house - framers to the realtors to the creative mortgage hawkers to the Crate - and - Barrel furniture elves -- will drop into a black hole .
Mortgage obligations will not be met , credit card payments will stop , house refinancings will no longer be possible as equity dissolves , the WalMart associates will get their pink slips , the vacancy signs will go up in the strip malls , and a mighty sob will be heard above the prairie wind .
This is really a tight spot .
Wider war in the Middle East is hardly out of the question , with Iran and a broad array of jihadistas emboldened by America 's flounderings in Iraq .
A year from now , perhaps , or less , we will lose our access to a substantial portion of the imported oil that we run all our stuff on .
The sodium vapor lamps will flicker out .
The last taco will be served .
The US public will have to start paying attention and making other arrangements .
I believe what Garrison Keilor says about the people in Minnesota .
Scratch below the surface , you 'll find a thoughtful , practical mentality .
I believe that when they can't do anymore of what they 're doing now , they 'll turn around and do something else .
With summer almost here , and the green shoots on the ground ( if not on the Dow ) grown to leafy fullness , the White House has completed an annual springtime chore : choosing among the many invitations from colleges and universities for the boss to address the graduating class .
This year , three were accepted .
On May 13th , President Obama speaks at Arizona State University , in Tempe ; four days later , at the University of Notre Dame , in South Bend , Indiana ; and , five days after that , at the United States Naval Academy , in Annapolis , Maryland .

In recent years politicians have been given a run for their money at commencement time by anchorpersons and Hollywood celebrities , but loftily placed public officials , especially those who can be credibly deemed statesmen , are still the most sought - after speakers — and the biggest “ get ” of all , of course , is the President of the United States .
The President is a statesman ex officio , a guaranteed publicity magnet , and a person whose fame and entourage can bathe even the roomiest campus in a glowing aura of importance .
( Another plus : Presidents do n’t demand speaking fees or airline tickets . )
The feeling is mutual .
Your statesman regards a campus backdrop and academic robes as the ideal stage set and costume for the utterance of large , grave thoughts .
Winston Churchill was between prime ministerships when he delivered his “ Iron Curtain ” speech at Westminster College , in Fulton , Missouri , in 1946 , but he was introduced by President Truman , which made the occasion official .
A year later , Secretary of State George C. Marshall announced his plan for war - ravaged Europe under the trees of Harvard Yard .
In 1963 , President Kennedy chose commencement at American University , in Washington , D.C. , as the venue for the speech , perhaps the finest of his Presidency , in which he called for a ban on nuclear tests in the atmosphere .
If a President happens to have made himself detested — by starting or escalating a bloody , ill - conceived war , say — he is wise to limit his campus appearances to the service academies , where students and faculty alike are subject to military discipline and unlikely to be rude to a Commander - in - Chief , even one whose folly threatens their lives .
But a merely unpopular President is normally a trouble - free choice — and Barack Obama is anything but unpopular , especially on campus .
He ’s brainy , he writes books , he ’s pouring billions into education , his team bulges with professors and Nobelists ( and the odd ex-president of Harvard ) , he follows March Madness , and his idea of a lucrative side job is teaching at a university — none of which explains why the first of his graduation - day bookings was met with a dis and the second with a Donnybrook .
As for the dis , Arizona State ’s lèse - majesté was less lèse than advertised .
When word got out that the invitation did not include an honorary degree , Obama did not complain .
Nevertheless , awkwardness ensued .
A.S.U.’s president explained that his institution no longer confers honorary degrees on “ sitting politicians . ”
A university spokesperson unhelpfully pointed out that at A.S.U. honorary degrees are reserved for “ someone who ’s really outstanding , who has made outstanding contributions in their field . ”
Obama , whose field is being President , has n’t been on the job long enough to qualify .
On the other hand , Obama will be A.S.U. ’s first outside commencement speaker in thirty years , which is a big honor right there .
And the university hastened to expand its main financial - aid program and rename it the President Barack Obama Scholars Program .
Despite the weather forecast — a hundred degrees and very , very sunny — an audience of sixty - five thousand is expected , Obama ’s largest since Inauguration Day .
Notre Dame planned from the start to confer an honorary doctorate on Obama , as it has done for eight of his predecessors , beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt .
This only heightened the dudgeon of the American Catholic right .
The loudest protests have been orchestrated by the Cardinal Newman Society , founded in 1993 and unconnected with the Newman Centers for Catholic students , which are a familiar sight on hundreds of campuses .
The group describes itself as dedicated to strengthening “ Catholic identity ” at Catholic colleges and universities , “ many ” of which — including Notre Dame , apparently , the Gipper notwithstanding — embrace “ a mistaken notion of academic freedom . ”
It claims to have collected three hundred and fifty thousand names on a Web petition demanding that Notre Dame rescind its invitation and “ halt this travesty immediately . ”
Pat Buchanan chimed in , accusing Notre Dame of saying that Obama ’s alleged “ support for policies and programs that bring death to more than a million unborn children every year is no disqualification to being honored by a university dedicated to Our Lady who carried to term the Son of God . ”
And the protests are not just a fringe phenomenon .
Sixty - eight American bishops — one of whom suggested that Notre Dame change its name to Northwestern Indiana Humanist University — have voiced their displeasure .
But Obama is not such an easy target .
One of his first acts as President was to cancel the so - called “ global gag rule , ” which denied funds to overseas family - planning organizations that also offer abortion services , or even information about abortion .
But because the main focus of such organizations is contraception , cutting off their funding almost certainly resulted in more ( and more dangerous ) abortions , not fewer ( and safer ) ones .
The President also reversed his predecessor ’s ban on funding for embryonic stem - cell research , but specified that the embryos must come from fertility clinics that would otherwise discard them .
At his most recent press conference , he rejected the idea “ that this is simply an issue about women ’s freedom and that there ’s no other considerations . ”
And he noted that his domestic - policy staff “ is working with groups both in the pro-choice camp and in the pro-life camp to see if we can arrive at some consensus ” on ways to reduce the unwanted pregnancies that are abortion ’s invariable precondition .
In any case , the controversy about Obama ’s Notre Dame appearance is less about him than about divisions within the American Catholic community .
Church teaching holds that abortion , even in cases of rape or incest , is an “ intrinsic evil . ”
Contraception is an “ intrinsic evil , ” too ( as is torture ) .
But a Pew poll prompted by the Notre Dame flap found that more Catholics would keep abortion legal in all or most cases than would ban or restrict it , and a Gallup study found practically no difference between Catholics and non-Catholics on embryonic stem - cell research , which is “ morally acceptable ” to around sixty per cent of both groups .
It is significant that sixty - eight bishops have protested Notre Dame ’s invitation , but just as significant that hundreds have not .
The real division is between social conservatives , on the one hand , and social moderates and liberals , on the other , not between Catholics and non-Catholics .
But that does n’t make it any less deep , and Obama ’s approach — practical , nonideological , “ pro-choice ” but hardly pro-abortion — is more likely than any of the alternatives to keep it relatively civil .
Meanwhile , from the midshipmen at Annapolis , not a peep .

Hong Wei was born with an extra thumb on his right hand
By James Reynolds
BBC News , Shanxi , central China
For the Li family , the best part of the day comes at noon .
Every day , after school , Li San San picks up his children from school , jams them all onto the back of his motorbike and drives them through the hills back home .
The kids cling onto each other and laugh as they try not to fall off .
On the main roads nearby , lines of coal trucks head off to the rest of China .
The valleys are full of steelworks and heavy industry .
The Li family get back to their home , which is carved into the side of a hill .
Six - year - old Hong Wei eats his noodles and sits quietly in front of his school notebook .
He has a shy smile and hides in his sister 's lap when we try to talk to him .
Hong Wei was born with an extra thumb on his right hand .
His elder sister Lixia , who 's 14 , was born with a twisted left foot and walks with a heavy limp .
Like many people in Shanxi , this family is too poor to go to the doctors .
The parents do n't know why their children were born with defects .
They 're simply left to guess .
" The air is n't good around here , " says Li San San .
" When it 's bad , it 's difficult to breathe , it looks gloomy and smoggy out there . "
The province of Shanxi is one of the most polluted places in the world .

The rate of birth defects in this region is six times higher than the national average .
In January , the director of family planning in Shanxi , An Huanxiao , told the China Daily newspaper that the province 's high rate of birth defects was related to environmental pollution .
But doctors we spoke to in Shanxi are more sceptical .
One doctor at a village clinic told us that a local survey carried out in 2002 concluded that birth defects were caused by malnutrition .
As a result , he said that the authorities decided to distribute enriched flour to poor families in the area .
Poor medical care
At the Zhong Yang county maternity hospital , also in Shanxi , there 's a view that malnutrition is as much to blame as pollution .
A poster on the wall encourages pregnant mothers to eat well .
Zhao Shuzhen , 23 , has come in for an ultrasound as she is nine months pregnant .
" This is my first baby so we want to know whether or not the kid will be okay , " she says .
" My husband was worried so we discussed it and decided to come to the hospital . "
The Zhang family , in the village of Gao Jiagou , has never had the benefit of proper medical attention .
The family 's two eldest children , 13 - year - old Yi Mei and 9 - year - old Yi Long were both born with mental disabilities .
Yi Long is unable to talk .
Yi Mei can only say one word and spends the day listening to music on a mobile phone .
It 's too early to tell whether new born Yi Wu is healthy
Their mother has just given birth to a third child , Yi Wu .
The new baby lies under a blanket in the middle of the only bed in the house .
A cardboard box is propped up behind his pillow .
His mother believes it 's too soon to tell for sure whether or not Yi Wu has been born without any disabilities .
But she keeps looking at him , hoping for signs that he is okay .
" When I look at him he seems alright , " she says hopefully .
She wants him to be a doctor when he grows up .
China has promised to clear up its air and water , but in this province , industry comes before a cleaner environment .
And in the grime of this one house in Shanxi , the hopes of an entire family rest on one baby .

It ’s 5/7/09 , a nice odd sequence , so time for a few odds and ends I ’ve collected .
OK , this is worth a few minutes of your life : the elevated demo is awe - inspiring .
Terrain generation ( be patient when you start it ) , fly - by’s , and music , all in less than 4096 bytes .
By way of comparison , an empty MS Word document is 9834 bytes .

Google has put out a browser - based low - level 3D graphics API called O3D .
API here .
Demos here .
Some initial impressions here .
It will be interesting to see if they succeed where so many others have failed .
There is a call for participation out for a new book series called “ Game Engine Gems “ , edited by Eric Lengyel .
( thanks to Marwan Ansari )
The main thing I look at on the SIGGRAPH exhibition floor are the book booths .
Good books are such a ridiculous bargain : if a book like Geometric Tools saves a programmer 2 hours of time , it ’s paid for itself .
One new book that I want to see is Real - Time Cameras , by Mark Haigh - Hutchinson , which came out this April .
Looking around for more info , I noticed this sad note .
I never met Mark , but we corresponded a few times .
He came up with a clever idea to avoid performing division when doing a point in polygon test ; I folded this into the CrossingsMultiplyTest Graphics Gems code here , crediting him .
I ’ve been looking at GPU capabilities and benchmarking information lately .
Some nice resources :
You probably know about the benchmarking group Futuremark .
Me , I had n’t realized they had useful stats at their site : see the Futuremark ORB links at the bottom of the page and start clicking .
Two applications that tell you a ton about your card ’s capabilities : GPU-Z , with a ton of information and a statistics page & cute map of downloads at their site , and GPU Caps , which also includes CUDA - related information and some nice little OpenGL benchmarks .
Chris Dragan has a web database that provides a fair amount of data on card support for DirectX capabilities and OpenGL extensions .
The Notebook Check site had way too much information about many laptop graphics accelerators .
n Hancer is a utility for NVIDIA cards .
It lets you get at all sorts of different capabilities on your GPU , on a per - game basis .
There are also interesting antialiasing and anisotropic filtering comparison pages ( click on the radio buttons ) .

Some interesting libraries I ran across lately :
GTS is an open - source mesh manipulation package .
Box2D is a 2D physics engine .
Touchlib is a multitouch development kit. ( thanks to Morgan McGuire )
Coincidental world : it turns out there ’s a different “ Eric Haines ” out there that made a well - received 3D graphics game for the iPhone , Realmaze 3D .
I ’m not sure how it compares to his The Magical Flying Pink Pony Game , which looks awesome .
( thanks to Nikolai Sander )
I ’ve seen similar real - world illusions , but still thought this one was pretty great .

HR 875 - Monsanto's agriculture bill - NewsGrabs Sunday , 29 March 2009
HR 875 - What might the so - called " Monsanto bill " really do ?
HR 875 , the Food Safety Modernization
Act of 2009 , is a limited - vision attempt by moderate Democrats and Republicans to craft food safety legislation to address the out - of - control filth and contamination that are inherent in our industrialized , now globalized , " profit - at - any - cost " food system .
If the bill 's regulations were applied in a one - size - fits - all manner to certified organic and farm - to - consumer operations , it could have a devastating impact on small farmers , especially raw milk producers who are already unfairly targeted by state food - safety regulators .
The Empire Strikes Again - Controlling Food from Growth to Table
Last month , the so - called Food Safety Modernization
Act of 2009 was introduced by Rosa DeLauro ( D - CT ) as House Resolution 875 .
The bill calls for the creation of a Food Safety Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services .
This new agency would empower the government to regulate food production at all levels , up and down the chain of production .
As if that were not enough , last September , Senator Sherrod Brown ( D - OH ) placed before the U.S. Senate another “ food safety ” bill ( S.425 ) called the Food Safety and Tracking Improvement Act .
Also supported by Monsanto , this bill would – as with H.R.875 – establish an electronic “ traceability system ” for the FDA to track food production , manufacturing , processing , and distribution .
NHF ’s Scott Tips : “ Congress never seems to learn .
The NHF opposes these two bills as unconstitutional in their usurpation of States rights , far - too burdensome in their scope , wildly overbroad , largely unnecessary , and so discriminatory against small businesses as to be almost certainly intended deliberately to drive small food businesses out of the marketplace .
As with typical government action , these bills – if passed into law – would fail in their stated purpose as they would make food less safe , not safer .
Remember , the failed War on Cancer , the failed War on Drugs , the failing War on Terror were all launched by the Federal Government .
Are we so naïve as to think that centralizing food safety in the hands of the Federal government will be any different in result ? ”
Pesticide mixtures are more toxic than predicted
Certain pesticide mixtures are more toxic to young fish than would be predicted based on the potencies of the individual compounds , according to study appearing in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
Since pesticides occur in the environment as mixtures , it is often difficult to understand and predict their risks .
Synergy is the term used to describe a situation where the toxicity of mixtures is greater than the additive toxicities of the compounds that make up that mixture .
Synergism is of concern because chemical safety in the US is based on toxicity evaluations of single chemicals .
The bacteria boom - implications of the Human Microbiome Project
human beings serve as communities in which prodigious numbers of bacteria can thrive .
Since the average human is currently outnumbered by the pathogens they harbor , the genes produced by these bacteria outnumber human genes as well .
According to Mullard , “ Between them [ the pathogens in our bodies ] , they harbour millions of genes , compared with the paltry 20,000 estimated in the human genome .
To say that you are outnumbered is a massive understatement . ”
So by sequencing only human genes , the Human Genome Project has failed to take into account a vast number of bacterial genes that also have the potential to affect the progression of human disease .
The fact that many researchers are interpreting genetic data while leaving bacterial genomes and bacteria in general out of the picture is a serious issue .
Drink diet soda ; develop diabetes
A daily diet soda drinking habit is associated with significantly greater risks for select incident components of the metabolic syndrome ( MetSyn ) and type 2 diabetes , according to the results of an observational study reported online in the January 16 , 2009 edition of Diabetes Care .

Hundreds of deaths linked to schizophrenia drug clozapine
Fifty people die each year and hundreds more suffer serious side - effects as the result of taking powerful tranquillisers prescribed by the NHS , The Times has learnt .
Data from the medicine watchdog ’s own reporting scheme suggests that clozapine , a drug taken by schizophrenia patients , has been linked to 950 deaths since being licensed in 1990 — equivalent to nearly one fatality a week .
These figures are only for the UK - the article is only about use of the drug there .
Wonder how many people that drug kills world wide ...
Patient Advocacy Group Calls For Suspension Of JAMA Editors , Investigation
" We are deeply concerned about the unbecoming and unethical conduct of the Editor - in - chief and Executive Deputy Editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association , who were reported to have used unprofessional and intimidating tactics against a conscientious academic , Dr. Jonathan Leo .
Their behavior undermines the integrity of the JAMA peer review process , first , by failing to properly vet a manuscript for the accuracy of scientific reporting and for author conflict of interest and bias and , second , by launching an ad hominem attack on the scientist who was attempting to correct the record .... "
Nonprofit Hits JAMA Editors , Urges Inquiry
This is an article on Wall Street Journal about the same mess at JAMA .
It requires subscription to read , but I am anyway linking it as there was an interesting comment :
" Funding of experimental studies should be randomized , just like sample selection and assignment to case and control groups . "
Great idea I say - it could conceivably eliminate the nefarious control of funders on study results and their presentation .
Antipsychotics Now Top Revenue Producers
In US , Topping Cholesterol Drugs
IMS Health reports that in 2008 , sales in the US of antipsychotics ( used for absolutely every alleged mental disorder under the sun ) in 2008 reached $ 14.6 billion , topping lipid regulators ( ie , statins , etc. ) which hit $ 14.5 billion in US sales .
I can assure one and all that America did n't suddenly develop millions of more people with psychotic disorders .
These drugs are being used for depression now and that 's where I bet the sales boost came from .
America is no longer " Prozac Nation . "
It 's " Atypical Nation . "
And that ai n't good .
Florida : Approval process lowers the number of kids on atypical prescriptions
Nudged by public pressure , Florida health officials took a baby step last year toward reining in the use of power­ful antipsychotic drugs among children :
They began requiring that doctors get approval before giving these drugs to kids under 6 on the Medicaid program .
That simple step prompted a seismic change in doctors ' prescribing habits .
CDC Finances Bogus Italian Study To Support Vaccine Safety Claims
Documents disclosed under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) show the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) spends U.S. tax dollars in foreign countries on studies to claim the vaccination programs they promote for U.S. children are safe when they know the results of the studies will produce false and misleading negative results .
What the U.S. public is not being told is that the study was certain to be unable to detect any effect .
The CDC internal email exchange obtained under FOIA shows that , to be able to detect any effect in children with the methods used , the dose applied by the age of three months had to be more than 50 millionths of a gram of mercury and more than 100 millionths of a gram by the age of six months .
Table 1 of the paper shows Italian children received by the age of three months two - thirds of that minimum amount , or no more 37.5 millionths of a gram .
By four months they had only three - quarters of that minimum : 75 millionths of a gram and the maximum by six months was 100 millionths of a gram , not enough to hit or exceed the threshold ...
Vaccine refusals spur outbreak fears
Hundreds of thousands of fearful Ukrainians have refused vaccines for diseases such as diphtheria , mumps , polio , hepatitis B , tuberculosis , whooping cough and others this year , according to official estimates .
Authorities have cancelled a UN - backed measles and rubella vaccination campaign funded by U.S. philanthropist Ted Turner , and will have to collect and incinerate nearly nine million unused doses in coming months .
“ I never thought I 'd see the day where perfectly good vaccines are being destroyed , ” said Michael Bociurkiw , a spokesman for UNICEF .
Around the world , health officials say they are struggling with the repercussions of vaccine fears they call unwarranted and dangerous .
Perhaps those health officials should start taking an honest look at what vaccines actually do cause , rather than blocking any claim that links vaccines to subsequent health problems for fear of losing vaccines as an " effective prevention " ...
Why we are spending so much on HIV / AIDS ?
Compare just the research funding for HIV / AIDS with that for other diseases :
Why are we spending nearly 100 times as much on HIV / AIDS research , per patient and per death , than on research into heart disease ?
$ 2800 compared to $ 29 per patient , $ 207,000 compared to $ 2700 per death ?
Or compared to diabetes , 15 times as much per patient and 70 times as much per death ?
Hitching TB to the AIDS bandwagon
Tuberculosis is one of dozens of conditions that can cause a so - called HIV antibody test to react “ positive ” .
In Africa the symptoms of TB can be easily misdiagnosed as “ AIDS ” , based on the Bangui definition which defines African AIDS as a collection of symptoms caused by poor nutrition and lack of clean water , including diarrhea , fever and weight loss .
Now the World Health Organization only adds to the confusion by blaming TB rates on HIV infection .
AIDS : A Treatable Combination of Nutritional Deficiencies
Clinical reports from Zambia , Uganda and South Africa indicate that AIDS may be stopped by nutritional supplementation .
A number of members of the medical profession have observed that high doses of the trace element selenium , and of the amino acids cysteine , tryptophan , and glutamine can together rapidly reverse the symptoms of AIDS , as predicted by Dr. Harold D. Foster ’s nutritional hypothesis .
The Human Brain Is On The Edge Of Chaos
Self - organized criticality ( where systems spontaneously organize themselves to operate at a critical point between order and randomness ) , can emerge from complex interactions in many different physical systems , including avalanches , forest fires , earthquakes , and heartbeat rhythms .
According to this study ... the dynamics of human brain networks have something important in common with some superficially very different systems in nature .
Computational networks showing these characteristics have also been shown to have optimal memory ( data storage ) and information - processing capacity .
In particular , critical systems are able to respond very rapidly and extensively to minor changes in their inputs .

N.B. Editors note :
As Chris Cornwall noticed last week there was a premature announcement of BBC iPlayer going HD .
But now it 's ready , and Anthony has the full details .
Internet video used to be , and for the most part still is , a grainy , lower quality version of the video that you 're used to seeing on your TV , and subject to stops and starts that you would n't expect or tolerate from broadcast television .
The good news is that today BBC iPlayer takes a major step to address that quality gap , with some programmes now available in HD , and all programmes now also available in a new SD - quality stream that 's pretty close to TV quality .
As of today , iPlayer 's standard definition video quality should be as good as most Freeview channels , plus you 'll now be able to stream or download BBC programmes in high definition without need for a set top box .
Along with the introduction of these new higher quality formats , we 're also adding a new larger video playback window , adding adaptive bitrate technology to automatically deliver the best quality video that your internet bandwidth can support , and adding a diagnostics page that lets you easily test your internet connection speed .
Finally , we 're taking our cross-platform iPlayer Desktop download application out of Labs and ending our use of peer - to - peer technology .
It 's a major release , the most significant since the current iPlayer site went live in July last year .
Much of the new technology in this release sits ' beneath the hood ' , so let 's take a look at the new features in more detail :
i Player goes HD
Good news for those with fast computers and fast internet connections : BBC iPlayer now delivers some of your favourite BBC programmes in HD .
The HD proposition in iPlayer follows the HD content availability on the BBC HD channel , so we 're starting with about 40 hours of HD content per week , which will grow over time .
HD has been a long time coming to iPlayer , so you might be interested in the back story :
We first began investigating HD in iPlayer over a year ago .
The BBC HD Channel quality controllers have high standards and insisted that for us to label content as " HD " it had to be true HD - i.e. 720 p or above with no obvious encoding artefacts .
No cheating ( as some other video sites do ) labelling anything upwards of 800x600 as HD - our HD needed to be at least 1280x720 .
That meant using H.264 and an encoding bitrate of 3 M bps or greater ( we actually settled on 3.2 Mbps as our preferred HD bitrate ) .
However , since many people wo n't have an internet connection that can stream 3.2 M bps reliably , we wanted to make HD available for download as well .
Trouble is , a year ago our download manager was Windows - only , and we were determined to only release HD when we had a solution that allowed our Mac and Linux users to download them as well .
Additionally , a year ago too few people had a version of Adobe Flash that could play H.264 , which meant many users would need to install a software update in order to access our content - something we 're keen to avoid .
The good news is that as of today the various pieces are in place for going live with HD :
Our new cross-platform download manager allows Windows , Mac and Linux users to download HD , everyone has a version of Flash that can stream HD , and our HD channel now has more content available .
It should be noted that glitch - free HD playback requires a fairly recent computer with a decent graphics card - older computers wo n't be able to handle the CPU - intensive decompression & rendering and may drop frames , leading to jerky playback .
To get the best HD experience always play back in full - screen mode , and if you do n't have enough bandwidth to stream try downloading instead .
So , look for the new BBC HD Channel in iPlayer , then go full - screen to enjoy the HD quality .
Or , why not take this opportunity to connect your computer to your ( HD - capable ) TV set and enjoy HD on a nice big screen .
Note that HD programmes are about 1.5 gigabytes per hour of video , so you might want to check your internet package , particularly if you 're on a 3G connection , to see if you 're on a bandwidth - capped plan and , if so , how many hours of HD content you can stream or download before you reach the monthly limit for that plan .
New resizable media player
Back in December we introduced in iPlayer Labs ( the testing ground for new iPlayer ideas and features ) the ability to change the size of the video playback window .
i Player Labs users told us via their feedback ( which we hugely value and which influences our product design decisions ) that they loved the idea , asking overwhelmingly for this feature to graduate from Labs .
In Labs we tested three video player sizes - you told us that the smallest and largest sizes hit the spot .
So today the ability to resize the video player window graduates from Labs and is available to all iPlayer users .
New high quality 1500 Kbps video format
Finally , BBC programmes should look as good on your computer as they do on your TV , even if you do n't choose the HD option .
If you select the new large video window size , iPlayer will automatically switch to using our new 1500 Kbps 832x468 video format .
When you switch to full - screen mode , iPlayer will continue to use the 1500 Kbps stream for a playback experience that 's close to TV quality .
Programmes that you download using iPlayer Desktop will now also use this new 1500 Kbps format , making downloads now close to TV quality as well .
Regular video streams get a boost too
In addition to introducing a new 1500 Kbps SD quality format , we 've also shifted our default video quality up a notch , so that our existing High Quality ( 800 Kbps H.264 ) format now becomes the default used in the smaller video playback window size .
For programmes without fast movement played back on a small computer screen the quality of that 800 K bps format is pretty good , which means that as of today our baseline video quality takes a big step up .
Adaptive bitrate , phase one
You might be thinking ... the baseline stream has changed from 500 Kbps to 800 Kbps ... what if I do n't have enough bandwidth to stream 800 Kbps ( or for that matter our new 1500 Kbps streams ) ?
The good news is that this iPlayer release also includes the first phase of our adaptive - bitrate technology , such that iPlayer will now automatically switch to a lower bitrate stream if it detects that you do n't have enough bandwidth to play the preferred version .
For example , if you 're happily playing the 1500 Kbps stream when your partner at home also decides to watch an iPlayer programme on their computer and you do n't have enough bandwidth to support both streams , then iPlayer will automatically drop down to 800 Kbps , and then down to 500 Kbps , as needed .
In this first phase of our adaptive bitrate system , once iPlayer has dropped down to a lower bandwidth stream it will stay with that lower bandwidth version for the rest of the programme you 're watching .
Over the coming months we 'll enhance that behaviour to allow iPlayer to automatically ramp up and down between available versions every few seconds to match your available bandwidth .
For users on bandwidth - capped internet connections or who otherwise might want to override the adaptive bitrate system and use only our lowest bandwidth ( 500 Kbps ) stream , we 've provided an option to do so ( right ) .
New internet speed diagnostics page
With the availability of our new 1500 Kbps and HD streams we thought it a good time to add a diagnostics page to help you see what bandwidth you 're getting from your ISP , and also help us better understand average bandwidths that our users are getting , including allowing us to analyse the bandwidth available from different ISPs by time of day , etc .
Our new diagnostics page - https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/diagnostics
- looks at first glance similar to others you may have seen at speedtest.
net and elsewhere , but it 's significantly more sophisticated than other speed test sites we 've seen .
Most speed test sites measure the speed taken to download a small file over HTTP .
That 's a good number to know if you 're trying to measure your HTTP download speed , but what we and our users are more interested in is the ability to stream an iPlayer programme - and that means measuring RTMP streaming protocol speed , and from the specific locations where our servers are located .
Accordingly , our diagnostics page performs a total of four tests :
The first tests the download speed from our BBC web site servers , the next three tests measure the Flash RTMP streaming speed from each of three major content distribution networks ( Akamai , Level3 , Limelight ) , giving us excellent visibility into overall network throughput and allowing us to shape future design decisions accordingly .
i Player Desktop out of Labs
Three months ago we released iPlayer Desktop , our new Adobe AIR - based cross-platform download manager .
Initially we made iPlayer Desktop available to Labs users only , allowing early adopters to try it out and give us feedback .
Many thanks to all those Labs users who sent us valuable feedback - we read them all - you 'll find many of the bugs you mentioned have been fixed , and many of the ideas and suggestions have either been incorporated into the latest version or are on the to - do list for future release .
Today iPlayer Desktop graduates out of Labs , replacing our existing download manager as our new cross-platform download platform .
Windows , Mac and Linux users can now download iPlayer programmes , including in HD , for offline playback .
As of today , we 're no longer using P2P to distribute our content , or use your upload bandwidth - all content is now either streaming or direct HTTP download from our servers .
If you 're a user of our existing BBC iPlayer Download Manager , you can continue to use it to play back files that you 've previously downloaded , but all new downloads will be via iPlayer Desktop , so feel free to go ahead and uninstall BBC iPlayer Download Manager ( look for that entry in Add / Remove Programmes ) .
Note that Sky Player and 4OD use the same Kontiki technology as our existing BBC iPlayer Download Manager , so if you 've installed their download managers you may find that some shared Kontiki components remain after uninstalling ours .
Download to view on your TV
Although they 've not yet caught on in a big way , Windows Media Extender devices provide a way to play back downloaded movies and songs on your TV set .
Made by companies including Linksys , D - Link , NetGear and Zyxel , plug one end of these devices into your home network ( or connect via wi - fi ) and the other end into your TV set and / or audio system , and you can then browse and play files shared on your home network by any PCs running Windows Media Centre .
Many of these devices have HDMI outputs , 1080 p upscaling and SP - DIF audio output to your 5.1 system , providing a high - quality way to play back downloaded programmes on your TV .
User feedback told us that a popular use case for downloading iPlayer programmes was to play them back in Windows Media Centre or via these Windows Media Extender devices .
We have good news for these users :
We 're now making those same WMV files available for direct download , with no need to install any software - just look for the More Downloads option ( right ) , then download the file , save it to your desktop or Windows Media Centre library , and play it out as you wish , including moving it around your home network , playing it back on other devices in the house , etc .
Now working on ...
i Player 3.0
Over the next couple of months we 'll have a few more iPlayer releases with additional features , but the iPlayer team is now focussing on the next - generation of the iPlayer site - we call it the iPlayer 3.0 release - coming this summer - though it 's early days it 's looking really exciting - stay tuned for more info as development progresses .

The connections of Pirate Bay judge Tomas Norström to national and international pro-copyright lobby groups are even more far reaching than initially reported .
Consequently , many leading figures within the Swedish judicial system are now convinced that a retrial is necessary so the defendants can have an unbiased trial .
A few days after the verdict in the Pirate Bay trial was made public , judge Tomas Norström was heavily criticized for his involvement with pro-copyright lobby groups .
To everyone ’s surprise , Norström never declared these activities before he took on the case .
Together with several of the lawyers who represented the movie and music industries , the judge was a member of the Swedish Association of copyright ( SFU ) and the Swedish Association for Protection of Industrial Property ( SFIR ) .
These engagements automatically make him a member of two major international pro-copyright organizations , ALAI and AIPPI .
In their statutes , these organizations state that it ’s their goal to ensure that the interests of copyright holders are satisfied .
Indeed , by sentencing the Pirate Bay defendants to a year in prison in addition to the high damages they were ordered to pay , the judge lived up to these expectations .
Initially , many Swedish legal system insiders doubted whether the connections to the Swedish groups were enough to warrant a retrial , but the ties to ALAI and AIPPI have changed that perception , according to Swedish radio .
Many of the insiders and experts wish to remain anonymous , but Eric Bylander , Associate Professor of Procedural Law at the University of Gothenburg said that “ confidence in the judicial system requires that the court of appeal see this as bias . ”
If a retrial is granted this would mean another win for the Pirate Bay defendants and a replay of the ‘ Spectrial ’ , with possibly a rewritten ending .
Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde , one of the defendants convicted by the biased judge , hopes to see a retrial .
“ In the best interest of the Swedish people ’s trust in the system a retrial should be not only granted , but pushed for , ” he told Torrent Freak .
Requests for a retrial have been filed and we will hear more about the outcome in a few weeks .
Aside from the biased judge , Peter and the other defendants will also request a new police investigation .
The investigation on which the prosecution built its case was headed by Jim Keyzer , who already knew that he was going to be employed by Warner Bros .
when he interviewed the defendants .
“ We want everything to be in the eye of the public so that we can get help to see that everything is correct , ” Peter writes on his blog .
Miss California blamed Satan for Perez Hilton asking her about same - sex marriage .
Carrie Prejean said on the " Focus on the Family " radio show this week that Satan was trying to tempt her .
However , Prejean did make it clear Satan and Hilton were not in cahoots together .
Dr. James Dobson :
Why did you give the answer you did with regard to the affirmation of marriage ?
Prejean : " Honestly , I felt as though Satan was -- and I do n't want to say that this person represented Satan , but -- I felt as though Satan was trying to tempt me in asking me this question .
And then God was in my head and in my heart saying , ' Carrie , do not compromise this .
You need to stand up for me .
You need to share with all these people .
If there were 95 percent of the people in the audience that were gay , you need to witness to them , and you need to show that you 're not willing to compromise that for this title of Miss USA . ' "
Prejean said that she knew right there , that it was no longer about winning .
" It was about being true to my convictions , " she said .
Prejean sparked a firestorm of criticism with her answer to a question about same - sex marriage during the pageant .
Miss USA Pageant Owner Donald Trump explained that her answer was the same sentiment of the president of the U.S .
But that 's only half of the Miss California controversy .
Donald Lets Prejean Keep Her Crown
On Tuesday , " The Donald " allowed Prejean to keep her crown even though semi-nude photos surfaced of the beauty queen .
The photos were taken when she was 17 .
" We have determined that the pictures taken are fine , " said Trump .
With those words , the fate of Miss California was sealed : she will remain the Golden State 's Golden Girl , regardless of unauthorized photos of her in semi-nude poses .
" We 've made a determination that everything we 've seen to date -- some beautiful , some risqué -- but we 're in the 21st century .
We 've made the decision the photos were fine , acceptable , in many cases actually lovely , and they are modeling pictures , " said Trump .
" A girlfriend took some shots of me at home to include in my portfolio for application , not publication , " she said , claiming when she applied for Miss USA , she did not lie about them .
And yet more photos surfaced Tuesday , this time with Prejean topless .
She answered those photos with a direct attack on the photographer : " I find it appalling that a professional photographer would publish shots from a shoot on a windy day which I was unaware of . "
Trump and Prejean reiterated their position in a Today Show interview with Matt Lauer Wednesday morning -- with her blaming the photographer , and the fact that she was standing on a cliff , and Trump saying that for this day and age , the pictures were n't that racy .
On the streets of Los Angeles , reaction to the news was mixed .
Vinton
Wolf called her a beautiful , honest girl who should keep her title .
Others , like Erica Grossman of Burbank , was surprised by the news .
" I do n't think she represents all of us in California , " she said .
" Maybe that was n't the best choice . "
And Richard Dunne said Prejean should 've been reprimanded .
" She broke the rules , beside the fact of her ridiculous views on marriage , but even without that , she broke the rules , " Dunne said .
But it was Prejean with the last word , as she told reporters , " Not everyone may like or agree with me .
But I hope they respect my rights as I respect theirs . "
Invertebrates with sometimes deadly stings make unusual incursion into waters normally considered too warm for them

Visitors to the Mediterranean could find themselves in for a painful surprise this year after Portuguese man- of - war invertebrates , with their sometimes lethal stings , made an unusual incursion into waters normally considered too warm for them .
The jellyfish have been seen close to the beaches of the Costa del Sol , in southern Spain , and off the coast of Murcia , in the south - east .
The Portuguese man - of - war , a jelly - like creature , gives a burning sting that is far more painful than that of a jellyfish .
In extreme cases , the sting can cause heart attacks in victims who are allergic to it .
Westerly winds have blown the Portuguese men- of - war into the Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar and along the length of Spain 's southern coast , scientists said .
" They go wherever they are driven by the wind , " Xavier Pastor , of the Oceana NGO organisation , explained .
" They have little sails and that means that , if the wind is blowing in towards the coast , they end up on the coast . "
Pastor said groups of the creatures had been seen off Malaga and the Costa del Sol a few weeks ago .
The latest sightings , around Murcia , were made by Spain 's state - run Oceanography Centre of Murcia .
The tentacles of a man - of - war can be 30 metres long and are strung with tiny stinging capsules that survive even when it has been washed up onto shore or if the tentacles have broken off .
The capsules have small triggers that release the stings when they are touched and hang below a pink - tinged blue bubble that acts as the sail .
Pastor said there did not appear to be enough of the creatures to form a permanent colony in the Mediterranean but warned of dramatic consequences if they did .
" It would be a big problem for the tourist industry and for swimmers , " he said .
" This is far worse than having jellyfish . "
Here 's Fox News host Neil Cavuto talking with a producer at 12:10 PM , recorded on a live mic ( update : Cavuto was in Sacramento ) :
CAVUTO : Any estimates on how many people are here ?
PRODUCER : No , we 're trying to get ...
CAVUTO : There 's gotta ' be 5,000 .
PRODUCER : Oh , at least .
You know , I mean the cops are n't going to tell us , and we 've been trying to get ahold of the PR person to give us their number , but I think 5,000 .
You can say it 's starting at 5,000 [ unintelligble , but sounds like " and maybe it 's more . " ] .
printf
f you 've been programming in C++ for any time at all then you 're familiar with variadic functions , functions ( such as ) that can take a variable number of arguments .
C99 introduced variadic macros , which also take a variable number of arguments .
C++0 x takes this concept a step further with the introduction of variadic templates , where the number of template arguments is not specified when you write the template .
You declare the variadic part of a variadic template with an ellipsis ( ...) just like with a variadic function , though in this case it goes in the template parameter list :
template < typename ... Args > class my_class {} ;
You can then specify the arguments when you use the template .
This approach is the same one you would use for a normal template , except that you can specify as many or as few arguments as you like :
my_class<int > mc1 ; my_class < double , char , std::string > mc2 ;
Just like with variadic functions , you do n't even have to pass any arguments :
my_class <> mc3 ;
You can have other non-variadic template parameters too .
After arguments have been allocated to the non-variadic parameters , the remainders constitute the parameter pack for the variadic parameter :

" There 's prestige to it . "
DOMAIN DOMINATION DOMAIN DOMINATION
Of 177 million domain names registered through 2008 , more than half , 90.4 million , ended in .com or .net .
How a few others ranked ( in millions ) : .org 7.3 .info 5.1 .biz 2.0 Source : VeriSign
A sea change may be coming to cyberspace with Web addresses ending in anything from .a to .z .
That has businesses increasingly worried they will have to spend millions to guard their brand names .
The familiar .com , .net , .org and 18 other suffixes — officially " generic top - level domains " — could be joined by a seemingly endless stream of new ones next year under a landmark change approved last summer by the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers , the entity that oversees the Web 's address system .
Tourists might find information about the Liberty Bell , for example , at a site ending in . philly .
A rapper might apply for a Web address ending in .hiphop .
" Whatever is open to the imagination can be applied for , " says Paul Levins , ICANN 's vice president of corporate affairs .
" It could translate into one of the largest marketing and branding opportunities in history . "
Many businesses see more problems than profits — opportunities for scammers to exploit brand names and mislead consumers , or even attack brands .
" It costs companies hundreds of thousands of dollars , if not millions , to enforce their trademark rights in the existing space , so imagine how expensive it will be when Verizon gets infringed in a thousand new domains , " says Sarah Deutsch , vice president and associate general counsel for Verizon .
" Many businesses feel this is a form of extortion . "
To beat a competitor to the punch , a company might decide it needs to control a new generic domain , such as .cereal or . detergent , but it would be costly .
The currently proposed application fee is $ 185,000 , says Levins , plus an annual " continuance " fee of $ 25,000 .
If more than one company wants a suffix , there could be a bidding war .
A more likely scenario would be for a business just to register site Web addresses pairing their brand name with any new extensions , such as fios .
telephone or gillette.razor .
But even that defense could cost marketers up to $ 1.5 billion , estimates the not - for - profit Coalition Against Domain Name Abuse .
Many businesses already do that , usually then redirecting users from , say " product " .
net to the product 's primary website ending in .com .
More generic domains will add to that cost .
Companies will " do it more out of competitive necessity than any real desire or ability to meet consumer needs or improve their business , and that 's a bad reason , " says Peter Fader , professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School .
" I would bet a large number of registrations would be purely that — people carving out turf they do n't want other people to have , but not necessarily turf they can do anything good with .
"
The turf war could be endless , says Dan Jaffe , executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers trade group of big marketers .
" Think about some of the companies out there .
Some have hundreds , maybe thousands of brands .
...
It 's really open - ended . "
Levins says ICANN is still taking comments on rules to protect trademarks , secure the Web and solidify a process to challenge new extensions as offensive .
ICANN wo n't take new generic domain applications " until we 've addressed those concerns , " he says , adding that the earliest would be the end of this year .
While some fret about new , more specific generic domains , others see opportunity .
" There 's prestige to it , " says film producer Minor Childers , who co-founded Dot Eco to push for a .eco domain for use by environmentalists .
Al Gore is among its supporters .
" It 's of value to someone who wants to say something about their identity . "
Such value would take effort to establish , however .
At the end of 2008 , 90.4 million of the 177 million registered website names ended in .com or .net , according to VeriSign , the company that manages those extensions .
Liliana Gil , director of global marketing services with Johnson & Johnson , does n't see the common suffixes being overtaken but believes , " This could be a fun new way to communicate a message digitally .
... You could have tylenol.children , tylenol.pm . "
A new extension likely would need a marketing push .
Generic top - level domains , such as . travel , approved in 2005 and .biz , approved in 2001 , have been slow to catch on , says Ron Jackson , editor of Domain Name Journal . " .
Com was the only choice in the early years of the Internet , so that has been branded in the public 's consciousness , " he says .
" If you 're a small businessman and you buy a new extension you 've got an uphill fight .
...
It 's going to be like being invisible on the Web . "

Browse column FRESNO , CA -- I think I 've finally found a religion I can convert to .
I 'm thinking of turning Sikh .
And we 'll just slide right by all the puns popping into your little heads , if you do n't mind .
The Sikhs are just the coolest warrior tribe around .
Take their scripture .
My Bible goes on about beating swords into plowshares -- I always hated that bit , because all you 'd get was a wrecked sword and a lousy plow .
But the Sikh scripture actually says that the sword predates the universe : " After the primal manifestation of the sword , the universe was created . "
See ?
That 's a god who 's got his priorities in order !
No doubt about it , I 'm letting my beard grow and practicing wrapping old socks around my head .
Gary B. Singh , you can call me from now on .
It all started when I got a letter from a guy named Gill , a Sikh in the UK , whining about how I 'd talked up all the other warrior tribes but never had a word to say for the Sikhs .
" Give us some love , Gary , " Gill whined .
Well , the War Nerd makes war , not love , but after weeks of looking into this Sikh thing , I gotta give the bearded boys their due .
The Sikhs have one of the most amazing military histories on the planet .
And they 're still living through their Golden Age right now .
One of the great last stands in Sikh history happened less than 25 years ago , when 200 Sikh militants holed up in their version of the Mormon Tabernacle , the " Golden Temple " in Amritsar , India .
Anybody with sense knew those 200 Sikhs were going to fight like demons , because that 's what Sikhs have been doing for the past 400 years .
Sikh military history is so packed with glorious last stands that George Armstrong Custer would be a smalltime footnote if he'd worn a big turban to go with that long hair and beard of his .
It was 1984 , and the Indian Army must have known it was in for a big bloody mess to get the temple back , especially since its upper ranks are filled mostly with Sikh generals , Sikhs being the designated hitters of the Indian war game .
But Indira Gandhi was PM , and she was a lady who did n't like being disobeyed , so she ordered her Sikh Commanding General to overrun the temple .
Mistake .
The Sikh CO inside the temple was a dude named Shahbeg Singh , who pretty much single - handedly engineered the collapse of the Pakistani Army in the 1971 Indo - Pak War .
It was Shahbeg who organized the Mukhti Bahini , the Bangladeshi guerrillas who made history by being the first Bengali armed force in history not to pee in their dhotis and flee at the sound of gunfire .
In fact , this Sikh must 've given the Bengalis some kind of Sikh blood transfusion because they fought well enough to make the West Pak garrisons surrender en masse even before Indian troops crossed the Bengal border .
After that it was the end of history for East Bengal , except for a bunch of whiney George Harrison begging chanteys , and a tidal wave or two .
Well , this same Shahbeg arranged the defense of the Golden Temple so well that at the end of a seven - day battle with the Indian Army 's best units , his 200 - odd amateur militants had inflicted 83 KIA on the army and even managed to blast the first tank to enter the compound .
They paid a price , naturally - at least 500 Sikh dead and the Temple blasted into gold dust .
But Sikhs -- well , if there 's one thing you can say about 'em , it 's that they 're willing to pay any price .
And they make the enemy pay , too .
Less than five months after Indira Gandhi ordered the attack on the Temple , she was strolling into her garden to be interviewed by that fat old Brit with the Russian name , Peter Ustinov , when the Sikhs got their revenge .
It must have been a pretty scene , the fat man sweating in the Delhi heat , Indira swirling up in her best sari -- when BOOM !
Two of her bodyguards , who were Sikhs , naturally , opened fire on her with machine guns , turning her into human chutney .
She died before the sweat dried on Ustinov 's chins .
And then , just to add to Ustinov 's fun , her other non-Sikh bodyguards started blasting at the Sikh shooters , killing one and wounding another .

BBC London News
Section 44 allows police to search any person or vehicle without suspicion Somebody in London is stopped and searched every three minutes , according to new figures obtained by BBC London .
The Metropolitan Police used section 44 of the Terrorism Act more than 170,000 times in 2008 to stop people in London .
That compares to almost 72,000 anti-terror stop and searches carried out in the previous year .
The Met said anti-terror searches had been more widely used since the planting of two car bombs in central London in July 2007 .
Terror threat
Of all the stops last year , only 65 led to arrests for terror offences , a success rate of just 0.035 % .
Figures showed more than 60 % of those stopped were white - about the same as the proportion of white people in London .
It catches no or almost no terrorism material , it has never caught a terrorist and therefore it should be used conservatively
Lord Carlile of Berriew The Section 44 power allows police to search any person or vehicle without the need for suspicion .
It was intended to be used for big events like the Queen 's Speech or just in designated areas where the terror threat was high .
Since February 2001 , however , it has been in force throughout the Met area .
Where and when it can be used is decided by the police who have to apply to the Home Office for approval for its use in a specific area for up to 28 days .
Lord Carlile said it was time for the Met to reconsider how the power was being used .
" The new Metropolitan Police commissioner should look at London again from the viewpoint of section 44 , " he said .
" It catches no or almost no terrorism material , it has never caught a terrorist and therefore it should be used conservatively . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Section 44 is used outside London but far less .
In 2007 , all the other police forces in England and Wales combined only used it 12,399 times , compared to almost 72,000 in London that year alone .
A
Met police spokesman said : " The threat to London from terrorism is real and serious and these powers are a vital tactic in our counter - terrorism strategy .
" They can disrupt and deter terrorist activity , create a hostile environment for terrorists and provide visible reassurance to the public . "
He added : " No one community is singled - out or targeted , terrorists come from all backgrounds . "
The Home Office , the Ministry of Justice and the Metropolitan Police were all unable to say whether anyone had successfully been charged or convicted for terror offences as a direct result of section 44 .

Trailer for Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
In the sequel , Sam Witwicky ( Shia LaBeouf ) again joins with the Autobots against their sworn enemies , the Decepticons .
One aspect of the Wall Street Journal article published today that we failed to mention in our previous coverage was that Apple is indeed working on a new type of device .
According to The Wall Street Journal 's sources , Apple is working on a portable device that is " smaller than its current laptop computers but bigger than the iPhone or iPod Touch . "
No other details were provided but there have been ongoing rumors that Apple has been working on either a tablet or netbook device .
In fact , some reports even combine the two concepts into a single touchscreen device .
Netbooks traditionally resemble smaller laptop computers and typically include a keyboard .
Apple 's ongoing research into multi-touch , however , has generated speculation that Apple may incorporate more advanced gesturing into a future device .
There was no time to hold her son and barely time to hear his cries .
Moments after she gave birth , Tammy Marquardt 's youngest child , Eric , was swept from the delivery room and made a Crown ward , as her son Keith had been two years before .
Today , two boys , now 12 and 14 , live somewhere in Canada in an adoptive family , not knowing the truth about their mother .
What has helped keep Marquardt going during " an exhausting fight " for exoneration is her determination to see them and tell her story .
" If I was to sum up my experiences over the past 15 years in one word , that word would be `hostage , ' " the petite 36 - year - old said in the Grand Valley Institution for Women in Kitchener , where she is well into the second decade of a life sentence for murder , a situation she hopes will soon change .
This week , the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted filed papers in the Supreme Court of Canada asking to have her case reopened .
Marquardt , who grew up in Scarborough , was convicted in October 1995 of killing her first child , Kenneth Wynne , 2 1/2 , on the basis of testimony from disgraced pathologist Dr. Charles Smith , who said tiny red marks on the boy 's lungs and chest were proof of asphyxiation .
His findings have since been repudiated by six forensic experts , including Dr. Simon Avis , Newfoundland 's chief medical examiner , who say Smith wrongly concluded the child 's death was a homicide .
In fact , the red marks in question can appear for a number of reasons and are considered meaningless without further evidence , something forensic textbooks pointed out as far back as 1974 .
Kenneth , who had epilepsy , may have died during a seizure or of other natural causes , said Avis .
Of the dozens of parents whose lives were ruined by Smith 's mistakes , Marquardt is the only one still behind bars .
In documents filed with the Supreme Court , James Lockyer , an association lawyer , is asking the court to order the Ontario Court of Appeal to reconsider Marquardt 's case in light of the new evidence , which was n't available when her appeal was dismissed in 1998 .
It includes assessments by five international experts , who looked at Kenneth 's case as part of a review by Ontario 's chief coroner 's office , and a lengthy report by Dr. Pekka Saukko , a professor of forensic medicine from Finland , prepared for the Goudge inquiry into the pediatric forensic pathology system .
When Marquardt entered the former Prison for Women in Kingston she was 23 and pregnant with Eric .
A guard , well - versed in the inmate code , which reserves its harshest measures for convicted child killers , offered some advice .
" She said if I wanted that child inside of me to live , I had better lie and say I killed my husband , " Marquardt recalls .
But before long , Marquardt 's case was mentioned on a television news program and conditions grew openly hostile .
She was placed in protective custody as stories circulated that she " nuked her kid " or placed him in a roasting pan and ate him for Thanksgiving dinner .
With the Goudge inquiry , things changed – sort of , said Marquardt , who followed the newspaper coverage and asked the prison librarian to download Justice Stephen Goudge 's entire report .
Tensions have subsided , with other inmates now sympathetic .
On the other hand , she 's still in prison .
" I sit here and go , ` Okay .
They finally have evidence to prove I have n't done it .
Why am I sitting in here ?
Mistakes were made .
Go correct them .
Let 's get on with it .
This is my life . ' "
Even before the terrible events of Oct. 9 , 1993 , when Kenneth was found tangled in his bedsheets , it was a life full of struggle .
Marquardt was raised by a single mother , first in a basement apartment , then at a Metro Toronto housing complex on Lawrence Ave .
E . At 17 , she left home to escape sexual advances from her mother 's boyfriend .
She lived in shelters and at friends ' homes while struggling to make it through Grade 11 .
At 18 , she became pregnant with Kenneth .
Two years later , living at a home for single mothers , she met up with Rick Marquardt , a former boyfriend .
When they married in 1993 , he was expecting a child with a former girlfriend , which would become an important component of the prosecution 's trial theory .
When Kenneth died , Rick Marquardt was at a hospital with his former girlfriend , who was giving birth .
Earlier that afternoon , Marquardt had laid Kenneth down on his bed for a nap , then fell asleep herself on a couch .
She woke up , went to the bathroom then heard Kenneth calling from the bedroom .
She said she found him rolled up in bedding and when she got him untangled , he was white and limp " like a rag doll . "

He died three days later after being removed from life support .
Two weeks after Kenneth 's death , Marquardt was so devastated she asked to go the cemetery so she could take his place in his grave .
The Crown would later paint it as a sign of guilt .
The prosecution 's theory was that Marquardt had been angry with her husband and took it out on her son .
Marquardt rejected a prosecution offer of five years in prison in exchange for a plea to manslaughter .
" I said I have n't done anything .
Forget it . "
At her trial , her older sister testified for the Crown , offering support for the prosecution theory by alleging Rick Marquardt had an extramarital affair .
As with so many other cases involving Smith , then regarded as Ontario's top pediatric forensic pathologist , the defence could n't find an expert to challenge him .
While on bail awaiting trial , Marquardt gave birth to Keith , Rick Marquardt 's son , who was immediately seized by Children 's Aid .
She was permitted weekly visits .
After she was convicted , she was told she could have " one final visit , " but Keith was never brought to see her .
Rick Marquardt disappeared from her life in 1995 and Eric was conceived with another man .
After he was born , Marquardt had periodic visits until he was adopted .
Her request that her boys be adopted by the same family was honoured .
Marquardt was allowed to write them a letter , which they can read when they 're 18 , said Michael Cvijetic , her former high school law teacher , who has stuck by her and poignantly recalls the borrowed red dress she wore at her high school graduation .
Cvijetic never doubted Marquardt 's innocence and has a theory about why she was convicted .
" You know what I think it boils down to ?
She was poor and nobody gave a s---. "
Marquardt intends to chart a new course after prison .
She wants to become an architectural draftsperson and plans to apply to the University of Toronto .
First though , she wants to get Kenneth a gravestone .
She 's been pricing them through the cemetery .
They want $ 500 down , while the remaining $ 500 can be paid in instalments .
There 's only a number to mark where he is buried .
" That 's not right .
He can't remain a number , " said Marquardt .
" He was a human being .
He needs to have his little mark in the world . "
The Hobbit 's foot is in many ways quite primitive Scientists have found more evidence that the Indonesian " Hobbit " skeletons belong to a new species of human - and not modern pygmies .
The one metre ( 3ft ) tall , 30kg ( 65lbs ) humans roamed the Indonesian island of Flores , perhaps up to 8,000 years ago .
Since the discovery , researchers have argued vehemently as to the identity of these diminutive people .
Two papers in the journal Nature now support the idea they were an entirely new species of human .
The team , which discovered the tiny remains in Liang Bua cave on Flores , contends that the population belongs to the species Homo floresiensis - separate from our own grouping , Homo sapiens .
The group argues that the " Hobbits " are descended from a prehistoric species of human - perhaps Homo erectus - which reached island South - East Asia more than a million years ago .

Over many years , their bodies most likely evolved to be smaller in size , through a natural selection process called island dwarfing , claim the discoverers , and many other scientists .
However , some researchers argued that this could not account for the Hobbit 's chimp - sized brain of almost 400 cubic cm - a third the size of the modern human brain .
Disease theory
This was a puzzle , they said , because the individuals seem to have crafted complex stone tools .
They said the Hobbits were probably part of a group of modern humans with abnormally small brains .
One team led by William Jungers from Stony Brook University in the US analysed remains of the Hobbit foot .
The group found that , in some ways , it is incredibly human .
The big toe is aligned with the others and the joints make it possible to extend the toes as the body 's full weight falls on the foot , attributes not found in great apes .
But in other respects , it is incredibly primitive .
It is far longer than its modern human equivalent , and equipped with a very small big toe , long , curved lateral toes , and a weight - bearing structure that resembles that of a chimpanzee .
So unless the Flores Hobbits became more primitive over time - a rather unlikely scenario - they must have branched off the human line at an earlier date than Homo sapiens .
In another study , Eleanor Weston and Adrian Lister of London 's Natural History Museum looked at fossils of several species of ancient hippos .
They then compared those found on the island of Madagascar with the mainland ancestors from which they evolved .
" It could be that H. floresiensis ' skull is that of a Homo erectus that has become dwarfed from living on an island , rather than being an abnormal individual or separately - evolved species , as has been suggested , " said Dr Weston , a palaeontologist at the museum .
" Looking at pygmy hippos in Madagascar , which possess exceptionally small brains for their size , suggests that the same could be true for H. floresiensis , and that ( it could be ) the result of being isolated on the island . "

Despite the fact that the UK parliament network was vulnerable to the Conficker virus just last week , reports suggest that the UK Government is forging ahead with their dubious plans to harvest all the personal electronic data of every citizen and storing it for one year , opening the door to the Big Brother super database .
Mobile phone calls , emails and Internet activities of every Briton will be stored for a year , placing legal duties on Internet companies to store everyone 's private information , including email traffic and Internet browsing histories effective Monday , April 6 , 2009 .
The actual content of emails or phone calls wo n't be retained ; however , details like IP addresses , dates , time and user telephone numbers will be .
The terms of the EU directive required the Home Office to write to leading Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) and phone companies and offer compensation for costs incurred in retaining the data for a year .
ISPs confirmed that the Home Office had written them to set out their obligations under the new law .
Home Secretary Gets Taste of Her Own Medicine
In a twist of what one could call poetic justice , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was embarrassed when some very personal and private information about her family ended up in the public domain through a ' security vetted ' outside contractor , who had been employed " in good faith . "
( Source : timesonline.co.uk )
Smith 's private information included personal expenses that milked taxpayers in what the Times Online calls unseemly and avaricious fashion .
According to reports , her husband even used taxpayer money to rent adult movies .
She was n't alone .
Other MPs found their expenses copied and leaked , offered for sale to the media for a hefty price .
The information was supposed to be published officially in the summer -- once every member went through and deleted details they wanted to keep private -- but both the original and edited versions were on sale .
As noted by the Times Online , people have been assured that they did n't need to worry about leaks and that the security of everyone 's information would n't be compromised .
The government has repeatedly proven that this is a major fallacy because it can't even keep its own information safe .
60 million constituents of theirs are about to have the same problem .

Multiple Problems with Britain's Database
A comprehensive map of Britain 's database state report from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust Ltd. reveals some very disturbing information on the many central databases built by the government .
The databases hold information on every aspect of its citizens lives -- from health and education to welfare , law enforcement and tax -- and are alleged to make public services better or cheaper .
However , in reality , the exact opposite is achieved and it is shown that the databases are prone to repeat controversies of effectiveness , privacy , legality and cost .
( Source ( PDF ) : jrrt.org.uk )
The assessment of 46 databases across the major government departments found that one quarter of the public - sector databases reviewed are almost certainly illegal under human rights or data protection law .
Furthermore , more than half of the databases had significant problems with privacy .
Fewer than 15 % of the public databases assessed are effective , proportionate and necessary privacy intrusions .
Britain is out of line with other developed countries where records on sensitive matters are held locally and that the benefits claimed for data sharing are often illusory .
Sharing those records can harm the vulnerable and make millions of innocent people victims .
A lot more information can be found in the Database State Report .

The Hazards of Data-mining Outweigh The Benefits
It is nearly impossible to guarantee the security of massive and comprehensive databases the UK government is assembling .
Involving more people in maintaining those records only results in increasing the risk and leaving more people vulnerable .
In the UK , as in the U.S. , taxpayers are paying the bill for their government to egregiously , and oftentimes illegally , spy on them .
If MPs are allowed to go through and delete information they do n't want made public , why is n't the public allowed the same option ?
More information on privacy issues and concerns raised by the new ' rules ' instituted by the EU can be found in the article from The Independent UK .

Editor 's Note :
This story is part of an In - Depth Report on the science of beauty .
Read more about the series here .
Cottage cheese , orange peel , hail damage .
By any other name , cellulite may still throw the perfectly sane into a tizzy as winter pants and coats are doffed for more revealing spring and summer styles .
This cultural anxiety has meant big bucks for some beauty product–makers and medical practitioners alike .
A barrage of products and procedures promise to seek out and destroy the lumpy fat on thighs , bottoms , arms and tummies , but a miracle cellulite assassin has still yet to be uncovered .
It might stand to reason that in our fat - phobic culture , where even famous backsides ( à la Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian ) are critiqued , such distinct jelly deposits are so loathed .
And cellulite does n't only afflict the full - figured .
It 's also a scourge of the skinny , not to mention girls as young as teenagers .
Despite the vast amounts of time and money that have gone into trying to find ways to dissolve these nuisance nodules — from lasers to caffeine creams — researchers and doctors are still scratching their heads .
So can anything — other than a serious overhaul of cultural beauty standards — really conquer these less - than - darling dimples ?
We spoke with osteopathic physician Lionel Bissoon to help us get to the bottom ( so to speak ) of some of the cellulite hoopla .
Bissoon runs a clinic for mesotherapy ( injections of homeopathic extracts , vitamins and / or medicine designed to reduce the appearance of cellulite ) in New York City , and is the author of the book The Cellulite Cure published in 2006 .
[ An edited transcript of the interview follows . ]
What exactly is cellulite ?
It 's a condition that affects 90 percent of women and 10 percent of men , mostly in industrial nations .
As women start approaching menopause , estrogen starts decreasing .
From 25 to 35 is when you start seeing the appearance of cellulite .
Estrogen has an impact on the blood vessels .
When estrogen starts to decrease , you lose receptors in blood vessels and thighs , so you have decreased circulation .
With decreased circulation you get less oxygen and nutrition to that area , and with that we see a decrease in collagen production … .
[ Also , at this time ] fat cells start becoming larger , [ they ] begin protruding through the collagen [ and become the bumpy fat known as cellulite ] .
Women tend to get cellulite around knees , saddlebags and buttocks , because they have three layers of fat in these areas [ instead of just one ] .
Women also have three levels of fat in the stomach and in the triceps areas .
Does cellulite serve a purpose ?
I do n't think it has an evolutionary purpose .
I think as people have evolved in an industrial society , we 've become lazier .
Our jobs are sitting at a desk , answering the phone .
We do n't go to the gardens and pick our food — we drive to the store and park in the spot closest to the building .
So we 've become more sedentary as a culture .
The bulk of the articles on cellulite in the scientific literature started in about the late ' 70s , but you [ could ] say women did n't expose their legs [ much before then ] .
What I try to do is find old picture books , women in the 1950s or 1960s ….
When you find these pictures , women had perfect legs .
And back in the ' 40s and ' 50s they did n't have the computer programs to retouch those photos .
Why do women get cellulite more than men ?
The [ structure of ] collagen , the main protein of connective tissue , in women has the appearance of a picket fence , whereas in men it looks more liked a cross - linked fence .
So you can see the cross - linked structure is much stronger [ and will hold fat in better ] .
Another reason women get cellulite has to do with the [ two kinds of ] adrenergic receptors .
When stimulated , alpha receptors will cause fat cells to produce fat [ as well as triggering constriction of blood vessels and release of sugar into the bloostream ] when beta receptors are stimulated , they break down fat [ as well as increasing heart rate and relaxing blood vessels ] .
In women , for every one beta receptor in the thigh , there are nine alpha receptors .
Estrogen also makes fat whereas testosterone breaks down fat .
So a women 's body is basically — and I hate to say it — genetically designed to be a place for cellulite to develop .
Men have one layer of fat throughout their entire body and a one - to - one alpha - and beta - receptor ratio .
Today we 're seeing younger women developing cellulite — women in their teenage years are getting cellulite .
How do you explain that ?
Too much estrogen makes fat cells larger , so …younger women who are overweight might have a condition called estrogen dominance , which means they are making too much estrogen and / or are eating foods [ such as soy or using containers that leak bisphenol - A ] that have estrogen - mimicking ingredients .
Why do some women have more cellulite than others ?
I 've spent a lot of time traveling in developing countries and photographing local women .
When I photograph these women [ who do n't have much , or any , cellulite ] , you see the kind of work they 're doing and the kind of food they 're eating .
They 're eating all organic foods , they 're constantly moving from the time they get up .
These women are washing clothes in the river .
Getting water [ in an industrialized country ] means getting up and going to the fridge or faucet .
For women in developing countries , they 're walking to the river and coming back carrying a heavy container .
So the physical activity levels in industrialized nations have also decreased .
Many women wear regular underwear with elastic across the buttocks .
When you see panty lines , it 's cutting off circulation — just think what it 's doing to your body .
Look , take a tourniquet , put it around your leg and see what happens .
And a lot of women wear underwear under panty hose .
The panty hose force the lymphatic drainage back into the body .
It 's like turning the hose on and clamping it so every thing gets backed up .
Cellulite did n't become a problem until the 1970s and 1980s when the diet and activity and underwear started changing .
Back in the ' 20s , women wore longer skirts and the underwear was loose , almost like pajamas .
Cellulite is always underneath where the elastics go , and if you draw an invisible line where the cellulite is , you will see where the panty lines are .
I tell people the most important preventive thing you can do , if you can't afford treatment , is change your [ style of ] underwear : Wear a thong .
Does diet play a big role in the amount of cellulite people get ?
Diet does play a role , because look , women in Asia , what do they have for breakfast ?
Noodles — it 's a high - calorie meal , but when they go to work they burn those calories .
In contrast , we eat these calories , then go to work and sit at a desk .
Think of those [ fat - producing ] alpha receptors just waiting to rock and roll .
So , it all goes together .
That 's why women struggle to lose weight below the waist .
From the waist up , for every four receptors that break down fat , there are five that make it , so it 's almost a one - to - one ratio .
From the trunk up , there 's just one layer of fat , except for the triceps arm area .
It 's really a whole biochemistry .
People tell you :
Do n't eat fat , do n't eat sugar .
It 's really more than that .
It 's hormone balance — you need to eat healthy , you need activity .
How big a role do genes play in cellulite levels ?
There is a genetic component or predisposition to cellulite .
But just because you have the genetic component does n't mean you have to develop it if you do the right things : eat a healthy diet , exercise , and skip restrictive underwear .
Do creams — thigh creams , caffeine creams — really work ?
Most all creams will only address the fat .
So the Nivea [ Good - Bye Cellulite Gel - Cream ] and others with L - Carnitine transports fats into the [ cells ' ] mitochondria to be used as energy .
Caffeine creams will help by blocking the making of fats by the alpha receptors .
Some creams have aminophylline , ( a compound in some respiratory drugs ) which , like caffeine , works by blocking the alpha receptors .
In most creams , you find some way of targeting only the fat cells [ and not addressing the connective tissue or circulation aspects of cellulite ] .
What other treatments are there for cellulite ?
There are three treatable components of cellulite :
You have to address the collagen ; you have to reduce the fat , and you have to increase circulation .
But it depends on the grade of cellulite you have .
There are four grades , ranging from zero to three : Grade zero is no visible cellulite .
If you pinch the skin and see a cottage cheese–like texture — that 's grade one .
Grade two is if cellulite is visible on the legs of someone standing .
Grade three is if you see cellulite when you look in the mirror or lie down .
I call grade three " terminal , " because it 's very hard to treat , although the good news is that I do n't think anyone 's ever died of it .
Machines to treat cellulite include vacuum rolling and radio waves to break up the fat .
The first one of them on the market was Endermologie .
When you 're vacuuming and rolling [ the skin ] , you 're increasing circulation , and the heat helps to break down the fat , which smoothes out the skin .
The downside to the machines is you have to go once a month [ for at least several years ] .
What about lasers , injections and surgery ?
Laser treatments are combined with massage and rolling ; they either do suction or rolling and use radio waves and heat up the fat — put fat on a stove in a frying pan , and it melts .
[ Those treatments ] heat it up and hope we can break it down that way , and use section and rollers to try to force it out [ of the puckered near - skin area ] .
" Subcision " surgery was invented to get rid of indentations in the face ( such as acne scarring ) , and one dermatologist took that technology and applied it to dimples in the buttocks .
For subcision , you anesthetize the area , then you take a special needle — a
Nokor needle , which looks kind of like a little hatchet — so you can make a small incision and , moving it back and forth , you can cut the skin from the tissue holding [ it ] down , getting rid of the dimples .
I 've see women who have had fat injected into their thighs , buttocks , bellies and anyplace else they have cellulite in an attempt to even out the texture — and it was like a bump sticking out of the leg .
Other injections you have to have every few months .
The bad thing about silicone [ and fat - transfer ] injections [ that aim to fill in the dimples ] that they can move and can get absorbed — and you can't get rid of it .
As for liposuction [ when plastic surgeons literally suck out the fat through a tube ] , you 'll find tons of women who complain that the procedure actually made their cellulite worse .
Liposuction has only been proven to work for body sculpting [ changing the body 's contours by removing excess fat from some areas of the body , which does n't have much — if any — effect on the texture of fat that will remain below the skin ] .
If you have a doctor telling you that you can get rid of cellulite with liposuction , run out that door and do n't ever look back .
I know a lot about science and I am absolutely sure that this is how it works .

A 15 - year old boy from the Kemerovo orphanage who took part in a children 's contest to design a spaceship logo is to go down in space exploration history .
The logo he submitted has been approved as the emblem for the next mission of the Russian shuttlecraft , the Infox .ru website reports .
Anatoliy Perminov , head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos , has approved the design as the emblem for the Soyuz TMA - 15 mission scheduled to launch in May .
The emblem was originally entered in a competition to design a logo for the previous Soyuz mission .
Yura Menkevich from the orphanage “ Ostovok ” ( “ A tiny island ” ) took part in the Soyuz TMA - 14 Logo Contest .
“ His patch caught Roman Romanenko’s , the Russian cosmonaut ’s , eye and he and immediately decided that it would be a perfect match for his next Soyuz crew , ” the Roscosmos press service reports .
The logo features a golden angel against a black background supporting the ISS with his outstretched arms with a caption below reading : “ Soyuz TMA - 15 ”
The next mission ’s astronaut crew members will wear spacesuits bearing the approved patch .
Similar logo - bearing suits will be provided to the backup crew , with no names on them , however .
The Soyuz TMA - 15 is scheduled to be launched on May 27 .
The capsule is expected to dock with the International Space Station ( ISS ) two days later .
It will transport the commander , Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko , and two flight engineers - a Belgian astronaut from the European Space Agency , Frank De Winne and a Canadian astronaut , Robert Thirsk .
They are due to return to Earth in November 2009 .
A total of four manned Soyuz spaceships will be launched to dock with the ISS in 2009 .
Uppdrag Granskning : Gripen - the Secret Deals The Swedish television program " Uppdrag Granskning " originally presented Fredrick Laurin 's full - length documentary " Gripen - The Secret Deals . "
The website , though mostly in Swedish , features a wealth of additional information about the film in English .
More than five years ago , a team of Swedish investigative journalists got a tip from an anonymous source that there was something illegal at the heart of one of Sweden 's biggest arms deals .
The Swedish aerospace company , Saab ( unrelated to the car manufacturer of the same name ) and the British defense contractor , BAE Systems , had been negotiating to sell a number of Gripen jet fighters to the Czech Republic .
Rumors of improprieties had surfaced around previous Gripen deals , but nothing had ever been proven .
The source that came forward had worked on the Gripen deal in The Czech Republic , and claimed that he had intimate details of how a systematic campaign of illegal payments had been used to influence politicians .
The subsequent deal to lease Gripen jet fighters was important not only for the aircraft manufacturers , but also for the Swedish government .
The Gripen project has become the largest industrial venture in Sweden , costing Swedish taxpayers an estimated $ 15 billion , and the government was anxious to offset some of the financial burden .
With the Czech deal , it was also a chance for Sweden to break into the NATO market for the first time .
The reporters ' investigation culminated in the documentary series , " Gripen : The Secret Deals , " which uncovered a massive network of alleged bribes , shell corporations and secret contracts around the marketing of the Gripen aircraft .
Using hidden cameras , the reporters posed as business intelligence agents and were able to capture what seems to be an on - air confirmation from Jan Kavan , a prominent Czech politician and former president of the United Nations General Assembly , describing how Czech politicians across the political spectrum had accepted bribes to approve the Gripen deal .
The reporters also tracked down an array of contracts signed by the then - marketing director of Saab , which detailed multimillion dollar commissions promised to agents if the deal was successful .
When it aired in 2007 , the documentary caused an international outcry and prompted prosecutors in at least seven countries to open investigations into the suspected bribery .
When it aired in 2007 , the documentary caused an international outcry and prompted prosecutors in at least seven countries to open investigations into the suspected bribery .
Investigations are ongoing in Sweden , the Czech Republic , Britain , South Africa , Switzerland , Austria and the United States .
Last week , the international investigations yielded its first arrest .
Count Alfons Mensdorff - Pouilly , a BAE lobbyist profiled in the film , was arrested in Austria for alleged money laundering and bribery in the Gripen deals .
Both SAAB and BAE Systems have denied any wrongdoing and say that they continue to cooperate with investigators .
Kavan , the Czech politician who described the bribery that allegedly occurred in his country , has said that he was just passing on his personal speculations and that he has no evidence any corruption took place .
Reporters Joachim Dyfvermark , Sven Bergman and Fredrik Laurin ( Laurin is interviewed in the accompanying video ) won the " Stora Journalistpriset , " Sweden 's most prestigious journalism award , for their work on " Gripen : The Secret Deals . "

Teenage pupils should be given an extra two hours in bed to boost their learning abilities , a Tyneside head teacher has urged .
Dr Paul Kelley , of Monkseaton High School in North Tyneside , said continuous early starts created " teenage zombies " in the classroom .
He said research showed allowing teenagers to begin lessons at 11 am had a " profound impact " on learning .
Dr Kelley has already pioneered shorter lessons at the school .
Research suggests teenagers ' brains are wired differently to those of adults and work two hours behind adult time , he said .
Memory tests performed on Monkseaton pupils by neuroscientist Russell Foster , chair of circadian neuroscience at Brasenose College , Oxford , showed the students ' brains worked better in the afternoon .
People need to consider what is at stake here and that is the well - being of our children
Dr Paul Kelley
This suggested young people 's body clocks may shift as they begin their teens - meaning teenagers got up later not because they were lazy , but because they were biologically programmed to do so .
Dr Kelley said depriving teenagers of sleep could have an impact on their mental and physical health as well as their education .
He said evidence had shown rousing teenagers from their beds early resulted in abrupt mood swings , increased irritability , depression , weight gain and reduced immunity to disease .

More from BBC World Service Dr Kelley said : " This affects all teenagers from about year 11 and stays with them until their university years and beyond .
" The research shows that we are making teenagers the way they are and that we need to do something about it .
" Starting school later is important not just for their academic performance , but for their health and wellbeing .
" People need to consider what is at stake here and that is the well - being of our children . "
Dr Kelley hopes school governors will approve a new timetable before the start of the next school year .
Last year he carried out a trial that found pupils scored up to 90 % in a GCSE science paper after one session involving three 20 - minute bursts interspersed with 10 - minute breaks for physical activity .
The pupils had not covered any part of the GCSE science syllabus before the lessons .

For Years , IS&T Has Monitored Network Data Without Policy
SCREENSHOT FROM
https://mrtg.mit.edu/mrtg/
Since 1999 , Information Services and Technology has been collecting information about campus network traffic without an official policy governing how it may use or store the data .
Currently , IS&T monitors all network connections within campus , originating from campus or destined for campus , and makes a record of who connected to whom .
For instance , the logs would be able to show that a student visited a particular website at a particular time , but not what the website contained .
According to Timothy J. McGovern , Manager of I/T Security Support , this information is only stored for three days , though there is no official policy .
IS&T also monitors raw data going from and to MIT , which is scanned for anomalous patterns .
Though it is possible for someone to look at the raw data , McGovern said that nobody does .
Any suspicious activity is logged for no more than 30 days , McGovern said .
McGovern emphasized that no one outside of IS&T has access to the raw data or logs .
IS&T does not publicize any of these practices on its website .
Undergraduate Association President Noah S. Jessop ’09 said he was surprised that IS&T was collecting this information without notice .
“ It is not the kind of thing I would expect from MIT , and it is definitely not the kind of thing that I would expect to hear long after the fact . ”
Data and connections being recorded
IS&T collects information on network activity in order to investigate compromised machines , which are machines that have been hacked or have a virus or worm .
All connections are monitored , not only in academic buildings but also in dorms and FSILGs .
When I/T Security Support detects a compromised machine , they typically confirm that the machine is affected and then contact the machine ’s owner to inform them of the compromise .
IS&T collects information about every connection on campus , and keeps it for three days .
The logs include the connection ’s source address and port , destination address and port , start timestamp , end timestamp , and the amount of data transferred over the connection .
The logs do n’t include any of the raw data that is transferred .
McGovern said that the connection information is only stored for 3 days , and described that time as the “ current operating policy . ”
IS&T also scans a portion of all raw data that passes in and out of campus .
The data is fed into an intrusion detection system that flags suspicious activity .
McGovern said the raw data is not stored .
Mike Halsall , information and network security analyst , said that the logs of suspicious activity are not kept for more than 30 days .
For both the connection logs and the suspicious activity logs , only two people have access : Halsall and Tom N. Jagatic , senior IT security consultant , both of whom work for IS&T .
Jeffrey I. Schiller ’ 79 , MIT Network Manager , confirmed that this data is being generated and it is only being sent to the I/T Security Support team .
Schiller and McGovern both said that they have never seen a subpoena for these logs .
MIT has briefly stopped monitoring in the past .
In 2004 , as IS&T was undergoing reorganization , the raw data feed was shut off , which prompted complaints .
According to McGovern , the port was turned back on when staff contacted Jerry Grochow ’ 68 , the Vice President of Information Services and Technology , saying that “ being able to detect and recover compromised machines was a good thing , ” and Grochow directed that the port be turned on .
No Official Policy
Officially , IS&T collects DHCP logs , which are used to link people ’s computers to their online addresses .
These logs are what are typically subpoenaed when the RIAA or MPAA is pursuing an alleged copyright infringement case .
The policy regarding DHCP logs is published on the IS&T website .
In contrast , IS&T does not appear to have any policy covering the retention and use of connection or security logs .
Professor Harold Abelson , who teaches 6.805 “ Ethics and the Law on the Electronic Frontier , ” found it troubling that these logs were being collected without public knowledge .
“ It ’s a violation of fair information practices to be keeping logs that people do n’t know about …
If they ’re collecting logs , they have to inform people that it ’s there .
If they ’re collecting logs , there has to be a policy on how those logs are used or not used . ”
Abelson also said that because these logs could involve student information , having a policy is especially important .
He said that a policy would probably need input from the Council on Educational Technology .
About the logs , Jessop said “ It ’s egregious to implement measures on the network that could be used to circumvent user privacy without both policies and procedures in place and some means for the users to understand what the implications to them might be , ” Jessop said .
“ If you told me this was Comcast , I would n’t have been quite as surprised , ” he said .
JERUSALEM 
The Israeli police on Monday closed down an official Palestinian media center that had been set up in East Jerusalem for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI , as Israel and the Palestinians competed to exercise authority in the contested part of the city .
As the pope arrived in Jerusalem , each side accused the other of exploiting his visit for political gain .
Though the pope ’s movements have been carefully choreographed to avoid obvious political minefields , every step and word was bound to be closely scrutinized .
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war and annexed the territory containing some of the holiest sites for Christians , Muslims and Jews .
The annexation was never recognized abroad .
Israel has hoped to fend off any open challenge to its rule over Jerusalem during the pope ’s visit , while Palestinian officials said they were worried that the pope would be put into situations that implied de facto acceptance of the Israeli annexation .
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state .
( CNN ) --
The United States has offered more than $ 900 million to help the Palestinian people , particularly those in Gaza , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced Monday .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attends Gaza donors conference in Egypt on Monday .
" Only by acting now can we turn this crisis into an opportunity that moves us closer to our shared goals , " Clinton said at a Gaza donors conference hosted by Egypt in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el - Sheikh .
" By providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza , we also aim to foster conditions in which a Palestinian state can be fully realized . "
She said the U.S. aid package -- which must be approved by Congress -- has been " designed in coordination with the Palestinian Authority " to make sure the money " does not end up in the wrong hands . "
Clinton was referring to the Hamas leadership of Gaza , which the United States has designated a terrorist organization .
The Palestinian Authority , based in the West Bank , is led by President Mahmoud Abbas , whose Fatah party is a bitter rival of Hamas .
Watch CNN's Ben Wedeman on the huge challenge of rebuilding Gaza »
President Obama has not ruled out talks with Hamas but said the group must first renounce violence , recognize Israel , and abide by previous agreements that successive Palestinian governments have reached with the Israelis .
Clinton is on her second overseas trip as secretary of state , after a tour of Asia last month .
This week 's trip to the Middle East and Europe focuses on Mideast peace , NATO and relations with Russia .
After the conference in Egypt , Clinton will travel to Israel and the West Bank .
On Thursday , she heads to Brussels , Belgium , for an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in preparation for the NATO summit in April .
The next day , Clinton is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to begin the process of what Vice President Joe Biden has called " pressing the reset button " in the U.S. - Russian relationship .
She then heads to Ankara , Turkey , for talks with key leaders before returning to the United States on Saturday .
State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Clinton 's trip is an effort to " take the pulse of various leaders " on peace in the Middle East .
Israel recently ended a three - week military campaign in Gaza to stem rocket attacks .
Despite the operation , Israel and militants in Gaza continue to trade fire .
Egypt has been trying to broker a broader peace deal to reopen Gaza 's borders , which have been under an Israeli blockade .
Israel has allowed limited humanitarian supplies into the Palestinian territory , but international aid organizations operating in Gaza say it is not enough .

Israel says it must maintain the border closure and blockade of Gaza 's seaports to prevent weapons from entering Gaza .
Egypt , which also shares a border with Gaza , has not reopened the Rafa border crossing .
Israel is demanding that Hamas release a kidnapped Israeli soldier before it fully reopens the border crossings with Gaza .
But Hamas has rejected including the release of Gilad Shalit as part of a cease - fire negotiation with Israel .

Mr Mohamed , a British resident , claims he was tortured in US custody Police are to investigate whether an MI5 officer was complicit in the torture of ex-Guantanamo detainee Binyam Mohamed .
The Attorney General , Baroness Scotland QC , said the probe would be " the appropriate course of action " .
Mr Mohamed , 30 , a UK resident , said MI5 had prolonged his detention and torture while he was being held in Morocco .
The MI5 agent who questioned him has denied threatening or putting any pressure on Mr Mohamed .
' Seriousness and sensitivity ' Ethiopian - born Mr Mohamed says he was tortured while in US custody in Pakistan , Morocco and Afghanistan , with the complicity of MI5 .
He says that in Morocco in 2002 , he was mistreated by local officers who asked him questions supplied by British intelligence .
Frank Gardner , BBC security correspondent
This is the first time in living memory that anyone can remember the police being asked to investigate MI5 , the Security Service .
As the two organisations working side - by - side on the front line of Britain 's fight against terrorism it is an extraordinary and for some , uncomfortable situation .
The official Home Office position is that MI5 will co-operate fully with any police investigation .
Initially this is likely to focus on the MI5 officer known in court documents as ' Witness B ' .
This is the man sent out to Pakistan to question Binyam Mohammed in 2002 , at a time when he was suspected of being part of a major al - Qaeda plot .
But any police probe is unlikely to stop there .
That MI5 officer sent back reports to London , so how much did his superiors know about Mr Mohamed 's treatment and did they authorise co-operation with the CIA and his interrogators to continue , regardless ?
Awkwardly for the Security Service , the man running International Counter - Terrorism at MI5 at the time was one , Jonathan Evans .
He 's now the Director General , yet he may soon find himself helping police with their enquiries .
Mr Mohamed returned to the UK in February 2009 after seven years in custody - four of which were spent in the US camp at Guantanamo Bay .
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the investigation would focus on an MI5 officer known as Witness B , who travelled to Karachi in 2002 to question Mr Mohamed .
It is alleged that Witness B told Mr Mohamed that his only way out of Pakistani custody was to co-operate fully , and that the officer knew to where Mr Mohamed would be subsequently rendered .
Baroness Scotland said she had invited the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , to begin an inquiry .
" I have expressed to the commissioner the hope that the investigation can be taken forward as expeditiously as possible given the seriousness and sensitivity of the issues involved , " she said .
" The conduct of the investigation will be a matter for the police , with advice from the Crown Prosecution Service . "
The allegations were referred to law officers in 2008 by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
In a statement , she said the government and the security services would co-operate fully with the police if asked .
" Wherever allegations of wrongdoing are made , they are taken seriously , " Ms Smith added .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted that the UK did not tolerate torture , but said the security services had his unequivocal support .
" I want to stand up for our security services because they cannot stand up for themselves , " Mr Brown added .
But Zachary Katznelson , the legal director of charity Reprieve , whose lawyers represent Mr Mohamed , said he was concerned that crucial evidence would be kept from the inquiry .
" Many of the documents related to Mr Mohamed 's treatment have been classified either in the US or the UK and unless the police have access to all of them , they will only see one tiny piece of the picture , " he added .
Shadow justice secretary Dominic Grieve said Mr Mohamed 's claims raised broader concerns .
I understand that ministers are concerned there could be more allegations that British agents have been complicit in torture
BBC political editor Nick Robinson
Read Nick 's thoughts in full Torture claims probe : Reaction Attorney General 's statement " It goes to the entire issue of the involvement of the British security services with the activities of others who may have committed torture not just on him but on other people as well , " Mr Grieve added .
Former shadow home secretary David Davis said there was " a very serious case to answer " .
He added : " It is vital that this investigation does not simply select a low - ranking MI5 officer as a scapegoat , but establishes where the responsibility for approving these actions originated , no matter how high they go . "
' Due course ' Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Edward Davey welcomed the announcement .
But he warned that the " wider question of the government 's policy on rendition and torture throughout the Bush and Blair years will remain unanswered " until a full judicial inquiry was held .
Amnesty International UK's head of policy and government affairs Jeremy Croft said the decision was just a " first step " .
" We still need an independent inquiry with the powers to unearth any wrongdoing by UK officials during the ' war on terror ' , " he added .
Moazzam Begg , a British former Guantanamo Bay inmate , said he had spent several days with Mr Mohamed since the end of his " terrible ordeal " .
Mr Begg added : " It 's fantastic news .
" We 've been saying this for so many years now - that the MI5 were present at every leg of my journey during my extraordinary rendition , that included in Afghanistan , in Pakistan and Guantanamo Bay . "
Scotland Yard confirmed it had been asked to begin an investigation .
A spokesman added : " A decision on how this will be taken forward will be made in due course . "
Mr Mohamed arrived in the UK in 1994 and sought asylum on the basis of his family 's opposition to the Ethiopian government .
His application was rejected , but in 2000 he was given exceptional leave to remain in the UK for four years .

" In essence what you ’re saying , I think , is that I ’m going to , I do n’t care what the law says , I ’m going to come out , I ’m going to pursue an outcome that I think is fair and just .
I ’m going to rewrite the law .
And I think that ’s dangerous , " - Alberto Gonzales , a former attorney - general who secretly approved of breaking the Geneva Conventions and the UN Convention on Torture .

Popular insistence upon prosecuting George W. Bush stems from at least two faulty assumptions : 1 ) that our political and economic systems function in the general interest , and 2 ) that the crimes of the Bush administration are isolated violations of those systems .
Now , that man over there — he ’s the prosecuting attorney — and he could n’t be happier today .
He ’s a happy man today , because today he ’s going after a judge [ President ] .
And if he gets him — if he gets him — he ’s gonna be a STAR .
He ’s gonna have his name in this month ’s ‘ Law Review ’ — centerfold — ‘ Lawyer of the Month ’ .
Now , in order to win this case , he needs you [ the jury ] , naturally .
And you ’re all he ’s got , believe me .
So he ’s counting on tapping that emotion in you which says ‘ let ’s get somebody in power ’ .
‘ Let ’s get a judge ’ [ President ]
However these proceedings are not about that .
These proceedings are here to see that justice is done .
And justice , as any reasonable person will tell ya , is the finding of the truth .
And what is the truth , today ?
As Arthur Kirkland ( Al Pacino ) goes on to explain , the “ truth ” is that someone has been abused ( raped , tortured ) , and that the intention of justice is “ to see that the guilty people are proven guilty and that the innocent are freed — Simple is n’t it ? ”
Only we have a problem here .
Do you know what it is ?
Both sides wanna win .
We wanna win .
We wanna win regardless of the truth , and we wanna win regardless of justice , regardless of who ’s guilty or innocent —
Winning — is everything .
In his big finish , Pacino exclaims : “ That man there — [ Dubya ] — that man there is a SLIME !
If he ’s allowed to go free , then something REALLY WRONG is going on here ! ”
This memorable scene from And Justice For All comes to mind every time I see an article or hear a speech about prosecuting George W. Bush — and the people who write those articles are right .
I certainly appreciate their sentiment .
Al Pacino is right .
They ’re all right about the abuse and the rape and the torture and the law — and they ’re even right about the “ slime ” .
But does being “ right ” actually change anything ?
“ What is the truth , today ? ”
The “ truth ” is that we live under a political and economic system designed to support the interests of less than half of a percent of the total population , and to hell with everybody else .
Capital ownership “ wins ” and the rest of us lose because we dropped out of the wrong vaginas .
So which is more important : 1 ) that George W. Bush - is- a “ slime ” , or 2 ) that “ something really wrong is going on here ” - produces - “ slime ” like George W. Bush ?
Which problem demands more attention , the system itself or its defective products ?
By reducing this to a question of quality assurance in production we are forced to ask ; what kind of a system produces “ slime ” like George W. Bush ?
Can such an obviously failed system be revised ( “ reformed ” ) , or must it be replaced altogether ?
Has the time finally come for us to withdraw our consent to be governed by criminals ?
If so , how can we prohibit our political and economic systems from hatching intolerable “ slime ” like George W. Bush in the future ?
I should pause here to explain I am not at all opposed to prosecuting George W. Bush .
But how likely is the success of that mission within the same crooked system that generated , perpetuated and now fiercely protects him ?
Good luck with that .
Our broken system leaves we , the people , with no recourse in this matter .
There is no ballot box on this issue .
There is no referendum .
The “ decider ” has spoken .
There will be no prosecution of George W. Bush , now or ever .
It ’s time for every “ American ” to understand the grave implications of this reality , and begin to respond accordingly .
I realize that “ Arrest Bush ” and “ Prosecute Bush ” and “ Impeach Bush ” seem far more exciting and sensational than boring stuff like “ Fix The Damn System ” .
But the profound waste of resources seems an unjustifiable distraction from the root of the problem .
As long as the energies of brilliant “ progressives ” are tied up in attacking George W. Bush , those people wo n’t spend any time thinking about building a new system that does n’t generate criminals like “ Dubya ” or enablers like Obama .
Rather than challenging the status quo , this melodramatic obsession with prosecuting George W. Bush seems to actually support it .
The President of the United States is not an agent or a servant of the people and we do not live under a “ democracy ” .
So it seems silly to approach the problem from that naive perspective .
As an agent and a servant of capital , the President is obviously not bound by the democratic process or even by the law .
As such , pleading or reasoning or negotiating with him seems utterly pointless — let alone “ prosecuting ” him .
Agents of capital do n’t honor petitions or pay any attention to protests and marches unless those efforts present a viable threat to the interests of the owners of capital .
This was the genius and the courage of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . In addition to his nonviolent approach , he also knew where to grab them and how to yank .
Sadly , this also happens to be the reason he ’s dead .
I rest my case .
Meanwhile , the agents of capital seem very happy when we invest all of our time and energy in pursuits other than in building a new system that might inherently prohibit their crimes .
As Rob Kall reminds us , Bill Clinton failed ( refused ? ) to investigate and prosecute Bush Sr. for his Iran Contra illegal dealings .
Moreover , President Bush Sr. actually pardoned everyone who had been found guilty of their crimes in that affair .
Meanwhile , after a street in Odon , Indiana was renamed to “ John Poindexter Street ” , Bill Breedan ( a former minister ) stole the street ’s sign in protest of the Iran - Contra Affair .
He claimed that he was holding it for a ransom of $ 30 million , a reference to the amount of money given to Iran to transfer to the contras .
He was later arrested and confined to prison , making him , as satirized by Howard Zinn , “ the only person to be imprisoned as a result of the Iran - Contra affair . ”
Does this mean protest and petitioning is pointless , overall ?
No .
But these efforts do seem misdirected , pointless and futile unless they actually do something to change how the system works .
Our political and economic systems work just fine for the people they are designed to serve .
The problem is that those people comprise less than half of a percent of the total US population .
This is the system that made sure George W. Bush was President of the United States for two full terms without winning a single election .
This is the same system that hand - picked a young black man from Illinois to placate millions of angry “ Americans ” , and it ’s the same system that will ensure Obama dutifully protects his predecessor from any sort of “ prosecution ” — against the best interest of every “ American ” who supposedly “ elected ” him to office .
Most importantly , this system keeps everyone so busy trying to prosecute and petition and protest the symptoms of the problem that we do n’t have any time , energy or interest to invest in building a new system that does n’t generate those kinds of symptoms .
With due respect for all the moral crusaders who insist upon extracting truth and justice from this fiasco — what exactly is the plan ?
With such adamant refusal from our newly appointed leadership , how do we intend to enforce all these “ laws ” that George W. Bush has so casually dismissed ?
What consequences does Obama face for not prosecuting George W. Bush ?
Will “ progressives ” withdraw their political support ?
Seems to me , “ progressives ” were fairly divided about Obama long before he was appointed to office .
So what exactly is a “ progressive ” , anyway — and what sort of threat do they present to the newly selected President ?
Obama has firmly denounced any attempt to prosecute Bush and his pals .
How “ progressive ” is that ?
Where do we turn next ?
Congress ?
The Supreme Court ?
The same people who appointed Bush to the Presidency in the first place ?
As Dr. King suggests , laws are meaningless unless they are enforced — or at least enforceable .
Now a black President — one of the most popular Presidents in US history — deliberately ignores King ’s admonition with his refusal to enforce those laws .
This , if nothing else , should clearly indicate there is enough wrong with our current system to warrant its replacement with something that functions more effectively in the general interest .
Do I agree with Barack Obama that nothing should be done regarding the crimes of the Bush administration ?
No .
Quite the contrary , it seems reasonable to expect Obama — out of a little courage and common sense if nothing else — to voluntarily begin proceedings against the previous administration .
But exactly the opposite is actually happening .
What does this tell us about our system and Barack Obama and the “ new ” administration ?
Good lord , this guy was a constitutional law professor for 12 years !
So if we , the people , are forced to prod , coax , beg , plead , whip , shame , lobby , coerce , bribe , or petition him to do his duty according to the law , then “ something REALLY WRONG is going on here ! ”
But according to Aziz Huq , it ’s worse than most Americans even realize .
Turns out the US Constitution does not in any way obligate Barack Obama to pursue the prosecution of George W. Bush .
Quite the contrary , there is plenty of “ constitutional ” incentive against the idea .
But wait — it gets better .
Now , when the President signs a new law , he can also approve another document reserving his right to ignore the law .
What ’s wrong with this picture ?
1 ) Less than half of a percent of the total US population are passive claimants of economic wealth , who are also the most active daily participants in the democratic process .
2 ) The rest of us tend to be active daily participants in generating economic wealth , but we are also the most passive observers in the democratic process .
We , the people , consent to this crippling arrangement every single day we get out of bed and go to work and hand over most of the value ( power ) we produce to passive ownership .
But as Thomas Jefferson famously suggests , any time we get sick and tired of the system , all we have to do is scrap it and build a new one .
Is “ too big to fail ” too big to exist ?
No .
In fact , “ too big to fail ” strongly suggests that certain structures must exist .
But public structures like our government do seem far too big and essential to be privately owned and controlled by a few passive claimants of wealth and power .
The question of civilization is no longer “ who decides who gets what ? ”
The more pressing question is , “ how can the democratic process become an integral part of daily living to answer this and many other questions ? ”
Genuinely democratic control of our government and its policy might have prohibited the terrible tragedies of the past eight years ( 200 - years ? ) , making prosecution of George W. Bush completely unnecessary .
But genuinely democratic control begins in the workplace and is then extended to government — not the other way around .
Under the current system , no amount of protest or petitioning will result in the prosecution of George W. Bush or anyone else in his administration .
I wish I was wrong .
But once again , the model is upside - down .
It ’s time to flip it over .
For all his bluster , Mr Putin 's bargaining power is weakening by the day .
Russia 's foreign reserves have fallen by 34 pc since August to $ 396bn ( £ 277bn ) after months of capital flight and the collapse in the price of Urals crude oil to $ 45 a barrel .
The rouble also fell to a record low yesterday after sliding for weeks in a controlled devaluation .

Hersh believes that Cheney still has key people in multiple agencies -- especially military and intelligence of course -- who keep him informed at a detailed level .
He calls this a " stay behind " , an intelligence term for moles left in - country , to conduct sabotage or other operations in the interests of an expelled force .
He suggests that the extent of this network is such that Cheney has some lingering ability to interfere with the new administration , to influence the execution of policies , and to intimidate his potential critics still in government .
He notes that Cheney is easy to caricature and underestimate , but is very smart and a formidable manipulator , " the real deal " as he put it at one point .
I got the feeling that Hersh was choosing his words carefully on one level to be reasonably clear and to quite frankly alarm people , without getting too inflammatory ( as he has sometimes done and later regretted ) .
I also noticed that he did toss in the word ' sabotage . '
[ The Cheney discussion is scattered through the interview , but the key stuff comes near the end ; I gather from comments below it 's around the 35 min mark , with some other juicy stuff near 21 or 22 minutes . ]
[ THIRD UPDATE : I am told that Hersh was on Countdown tonight , addressed this topic , and made it sound less sinister than he had on Fresh Air .
For my take on what it all means see my Second Update at the end of this diary .
I also wrote in a separate comment below ( slightly edited ) :
It is very serious business , now matter how it is described .
Of course Cheney has no ' voice ' in high level policy , but he still has power to obstruct , intimidate , and ... well , we do n't exactly know where it stops .
As with the struggle over the US stance toward Iran , extensively discussed above , calling Cheney out for this is surely in part an effort by some to limit his influence .
At a time like this -- when everyone recognizes that the next few years may be a window like the 1930s , during which the US is reshaped in ways that will last for many decades -- an intense power struggle amongst DC power players , and other ' stakeholders ' in how the US government goes about it 's business , is inevitable .
Cheney is , so far as I can tell , still playing a central role in this contest .
Amongst other things , we should recognize the existence of this beneath - the - surface conflict , as we assess , comment on , pressure , etc. , the Obama administration .
]
This is exactly what I would have expected out of Cheney , but it 's still frightening and upsetting to hear it laid out by someone in a position to know .
So , what do y'all think that we -- and the Obama administration -- are really facing here ?
An infuriating rearguard action mostly about protecting the folks from the last administration , or something potentially quite a bit more serious than that ?
Watching what Cheney and his pals have done , I have wondered before in these pages about something .
-- so there 's the shit that we know about : rendition , torture , cooked intelligence , mindboggling corruption and cronyism in conducting an occupation , outsourcing military functions to mercenaries , secret prisons in far - flung locations ( some on board ships in international waters ) , assassination teams , and so on .
What about the shit we do n't know ?
What 's up with that , anyway ?
What did they do with all those billions and all that power , around the world , for eight years , that still has n't seen the light of day ?
How many mines did they sow under Obama 's feet ?
[ OMG , first time on the rec list .
Wish it were a happier topic .
Ummm , thanks Dick .
Now stop being such a dick , K ? ]
=======================================
First Update :
Cheney is also under discussion at TPMCafe in a post by Carol Gee :
Cheney could not stand the thought that Obama might have success as a peacemaker .
So he tried to poison the new President 's chances [ to ] deal effectively with Israel ....
Not content to write a book , join a think tank , or hold forth from his home in Virginia , Cheney has been making the rounds of the cable news shows trying to sabotage President Obama 's success as President .
And some have suggested that the public activity could be due to his increased concern about recent revelations of what he did as Vice President , i.e. , " the best defense is a good offense . " ....
Important details of the history of covert operations since the Reagan administration are in another in the very useful series [ on firedoglake ] by emptywheel ( 3/23/09 ) , " Cheney 's Assassination Squads and Iran- Contra Findings . "
Second Update
I gotta run , but wanted to mention that on one level - as some have commented - this is a no- brainer .
Of course someone as much of a connected player and policy shark as Cheney would still have ties and influence .
And it is suggested that Carter and Clinton both faced undermining efforts from within the bureaucracies ; beltway business as usual .
I believe it .
Nevertheless this sort of thing needs to be called out , especially with the stakes as high as they are now .
In some ways the stuff that Cheney ( and company ) did was just a Bigger and More Shameless version of things that were already going on -- at least at times -- in our name .
New and improved , if you will .
But Cheney and his cronies applied all the lessons learned in Watergate and Iran - Contra to expand executive power .
And so , what the Cheney administration was able to achieve is different not just in degree but also I would argue , in kind .
Just thought that was interesting .
This is not the first time such relocation offers have caused outrage in France .
In April , a car parts manufacturer in Brittany told workers they could be sacked or move to Poland for 700 euros ( £ 630 ) per month before tax .
The Gary Little Story :
A Man , A City And The News Media by Bruce Brown F EW SEATTLE NEWS stories have had more direct -- or quicker -- impact than the revelations about Superior Court Judge Gary Little that ran on the front page of the Seattle Post - Intelligencer Friday , August 19 , 1988 .
Inspired by rumors that had recently led Little to announce his retirement , the stories detailed Judge Little 's sexual relations with five teenage boys during the early 1970s when he was a prominent Seattle attorney and part - time teacher at Lakeside , the city 's most prestigious private prep school .
As the first edition of that Friday 's P - I was rolling off the presses , Little shot himself outside his chambers on the eighth floor of the King County Courthouse in downtown Seattle .
A janitor found his body in the hallway beside a handgun and a suicide note .
Remaking the front page of the main metro edition of Friday 's paper , the P - I inserted a story on Little 's suicide above the lengthy investigative pieces by Duff Wilson that prompted it .
That morning , people all over Seattle were awakened early , as if by a thunderclap .
In the aftermath , some expressed the view that the press had unfairly hounded Little to his death .
As the judge himself said in his suicide note , " I had hoped that my decision to withdraw from the election and leave public life would have closed the matter .
Apparently these steps are not satisfactory to those who feel that more is required , so be it . "
Many others , however , thought the press had erred in the opposite direction .
For them , the deeper question was how a man who boasted of pedophilic rapes could use establishment connections to avoid public detection over three decades .
Why , they asked , had it taken so long for the Gary Little story to be told ?
That question could be especially troubling to journalists .
I began wondering about Gary Little in 1969 when I was co-editor of the Lakeside Tatler .
It was that year that Little began teaching a class entitled " Introduction to the Law " at the Lakeside School .
He was then a slight figure with thinning hair and fashionably long sideburns .
Although his features were a trifle heavy , his face had a marvelous mutability that made him hard to read .
Like the editor of a small - town newspaper , the editor of a high school newspaper hears a great deal that never sees print .
I knew he was a 39 - year - old bachelor who liked to spend time with boys away from school , assumed he was gay , and heard gossip that he had an extremely odd relationship with his mother .
It was in 1970 , apparently , the year after I graduated , that Little began having sex with Lakeside boys .
He was careful -- even meticulous -- in his method of recruitment , but like much compulsive behavior , it could be uncontrollable .
Although the Lakeside student body then included many high - powered talents , including Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen , Little surrounded himself with a more mundane crowd of mostly rich kids whose desire for conventional rewards sometimes exceeded their ability to attain them through their own performance .
From these he recruited about a half dozen to become " Gary 's boys , " as the clique that spent time at Little 's Sinclair Island summer home became known around school .
Most of " Gary 's boys " were never involved with him sexually .
For them , Little was a dynamic and often very helpful mentor .
But it was from this group that he selected his marks , mostly white male boys , with slender builds , fair hair , and blue eyes .
The ones he took to bed also tended to be the neglected or emotionally abused sons of some of Seattle 's most powerful families .
That they were emotionally deprived may have made them easier victims , but , peculiarly , that they came from powerful families may also have been instrumental in protecting him from public exposure .
In any event , despite the considerable damage he did to some Lakeside students , none of the families told the school administration that Little was raping students .
Had someone spoken up then , Little 's tragedy -- and that of his young victims -- might have been avoided .
Little might have gotten the help he needed and be alive today .
So many people knew , or certainly had serious suspicions , but Gary Little skated forward under a benign silence .
By 1973 , though , Lakeside was beginning to have its own doubts about Little .
A long - time faculty member remembers a discussion in the faculty lounge " about Gary Little messing around with kids . "
That year was Little 's last at Lakeside .
But because the school had never received any specific allegations of impropriety on Little 's part -- and because many parents were honestly enthusiastic about the attention their boys had received from Little -- the school gave Little a good recommendation , enabling him to become , of all things , attorney for the Seattle public school system .
From all available records , it was not until 1980 that the darker side of Gary Little 's life was suggested to the news media .
It was to be much longer still before the story broke .
In 1980 , Little ran for the King County Superior Court bench .
Several former Lakeside students contacted Dan Coughlin , the P - I 's courthouse reporter .
They said that Little had a pattern of sexually exploiting people under his authority , and they feared for the youngsters who might come before his court .
Coughlin pursued the lead , but because the alleged victims were still unwilling to go public , he concluded he did not have a story and the issue never arose .
It was much later before a 19 - year - old Bellevue Community College student testified how Little bore in on him one evening after dinner at his house , calling him " a nebbish , nothing , " sodomized him , and told him he had " just been legally raped , " adding , " I 've done this before with seven boys such as you .
You are the eighth .
I have never failed . "
Within two years of taking office , however , Little had begun to provoke the same sort of questions in the legal community that had previously concerned Lakeside and the Seattle public school system .
And once more the system prevailed over public exposure .
Complaints by lawyers prompted the office of the King County prosecutor to prepare a 107 - page report detailing irregularities in the sentences Judge Little handed out to physically favored young men .
In the fall of 1981 , despite Little 's success in pressuring at least one witness to give false testimony , the prosecutor 's office notified the state Commission on Judicial Conduct that it would soon be filing a complaint against Little .
Two days before the complaint arrived , however , the state commission essentially threw it out by adopting rules prohibiting consideration of any evidence against a judge prior to its creation in 1980 .
This decision was championed by William Baker , an Everett lawyer and a personal friend of Little 's , who later served as chairman of the state commission .
All investigations by the state Commission on Judicial Conduct were originally supposed to be public , but the commission circumvented the legislature 's intent by inserting an intermediary stage of investigation prior to public hearings .
This is how the commission handled the King County prosecutor 's 1981 complaint .
Little was privately admonished for his conduct in three juvenile cases , but the the public was never informed of the complaint , or its resolution .
Little , meanwhile , began to recruit sexual partners from among the defendants who came before him .
One was David Curran , who appeared before Judge Little on a variety of petty theft counts .
Thin , blond and then 16 years old , Curran fit the profile of one of Gary 's boys to a tee .
By means of a somewhat veiled judicial ploy , Little essentially gave Curran a heavy sentence , and then suspended it at his own discretion .
In this atmosphere , Little had no trouble coercing sexual favors from Curran in exchange for a reduced sentence .
" There was n't a question in my mind that I could refuse [ Little 's sexual advances ] because of the fear he could do something to me , " Curran said later .
" The fact of me being on probation , it was enough .
He always had something on me . "
In 1984 , after Little had dropped Curran , Curran and Jerry Chun , another youth who had been abused by Little , met at the Conquest Center , a drug and alcohol treatment center outside Seattle .
There both told counselors about their experiences with Little ; both later said they were advised to keep quiet .
Although the state Commission on judicial Conduct continued to receive complaints about Judge Little , it did not think them serious enough to keep accurate or detailed accounts .
In 1985 , however , after a juvenile defendant listed Little 's place as his home in court records , the presiding judge of the King County Superior Court removed Little from hearing all juvenile cases , assigning him instead to complex civil litigation .
Catching wind of the move , the press began to reexamine the file on Little .
Seattle Times reporter Peyton
Whitely wrote several stories about official investigations of out - of - court contacts between Little and male juvenile offenders .
Then just as Whitely thought the story was really beginning to get hot , he was pulled off and assigned to cover other subjects .
When he resisted the change , he was told by Times City Editor Mindy Cameron , that " he was having too much trouble getting it together . "
As she recently recalled in an interview with one of the paper 's own reporters , she said , " It was all very elusive . "
Managing Editor Alex MacLeod added , " I 'm aware of the fact that there have been rumors circulating literally for years that there was a conspiracy not to report or to investigate his personal activities .
I can say to you unequivocally that that was untrue . "
Other stories , they said , had higher priority .
At about the same time , KING - TV in Seattle had taped interviews with several of Little 's victims , who also provided the station with sworn affidavits supporting their statements .
Reporter John Wilson prepared a thorough , hard - hitting piece on Little 's sexual abuse of teenagers at Lakeside 15 years before .
Again , the segment never aired .
Wilson 's superiors decided it was " relatively older news . "
This was the same year that the presiding judge of the King County Superior Court had found it necessary to remove Little from any cases involving juveniles .
When that old news finally caught up with Gary Little three years later on the front page of the P - I , he characteristically showed no remorse and offered no explanations .
" I have chosen to take my life , " his suicide note read .
" It 's an appropriate end to the present situation . "
The note concluded , " I am deeply appreciative of those who have wished me well these past few weeks . "
It was as if the judge , faced with being defrocked , was determined to sit in final judgment on himself .
Gary Little , the charming little man who always had to be in control but who could not control himself , strove for dignity by refusing to face what he had done .
The secret at the heart of the Gary Little tragedy may have been his own father 's suicide , which occurred when Judge Little was eight .
If his own suicide was a plea of no contest to the charges against him , it was also a final act of loyalty , protecting the establishment network that had protected him for so long .
Still , he could not kill the glare entirely .
The Gary Little story runs like a radioactive tracer through the Seattle power structure , exposing the old - boy network that connects many of the best law firms , local government , the old media families , and local barons of industry and retailing .
One measure of the size of a place -- no matter what its actual population -- is the size of story that can be squashed by the local establishment .
In this sense , Seattle has been a very small place for years .
If there is a bright side to the multifaceted tragedy of this marvelously talented man who twisted lives and destroyed his own , it is that in finally telling the truth , Seattle has grown as a city .

Last.fm Radio will soon require a monthly subscription fee of € 3.00 , unless you live in Germany , Britain or the United States .
The site has long offered a paid subscription option ( $ 3 per month in the United States ) that removes advertising and adds playback flexibility .
Soon , that fee will be mandatory for listeners in unsupported countries who want to access the 7 million songs on the interactive music service .
3/30 Update : After user feedback , Last.fm says it has decided to postpone the subscription to implement gift subscriptions , API partner support , and alternate payment options .
The reason , according to a source close to the situation , is that ad rates are not high enough in other countries to cover the Last . fm 's costs there .
Music fans in the rest of the world will be able to pay for the same ad - free version of the service that 's available in Germany , Britain and the United States — it 's just that they will no longer have the ad - free option , because the ads sold in their countries would n't generate enough revenue to keep pace with royalty payments , and Last . fm lacks localized advertising teams in those countries .
In ad - supported media , listeners are only worth what advertisers are willing to pay .
In this case , music fans in three specific countries will be able to pay for music with their time spent watching ads , while those in other countries will have to pay for the premium , ad - free version .
A comment that Wired.com has verified was posted by Last . fm employee Matthew Ogle explains that these three countries support strong Last.fm ad sales departments .
" These are the countries in which we have the most resources to support an ad sales organization , which is how we earn money to pay artists and labels for their music , " he wrote .
" We are focused on the U.S. , U.K. , and Germany as key markets , with the help of the CBS Interactive sales force and our own sales team here in London .
Our headquarters are in the U.K. and we 've always had a strong presence in DE . "
" In the United States , United Kingdom and Germany , nothing will change , " posted Last.fm co-founder Richard Jones on Last . fm 's blog .
" In all other countries , listening to Last . fm Radio will soon require a subscription of € 3.00 per month " or the local equivalent .
The Last .fm social website and all of its features will still be accessible for free in the rest of the world , but in the vast majority of the world 's 200 or so countries , as Wired.com confirmed with a company spokeswoman , the € 3.00 monthly fee will apply .
Last.fm , acquired by CBS early last year , has deals with over 280,000 labels and artists , some of which it pays directly .
( Warner Music Group , which failed to renew its contract with Last. fm last summer , is not one of them ) .
Jones did not explain why the company is implementing the fee all over the world except for in the three above - mentioned countries , other than that it was necessary in order for Last.fm to " keep providing the best radio service on the web . "

From Tim to Kim : German pop star , 16 , becomes world 's youngest transsexual after sex change op
German teenager Kim Petras who became the world 's youngest transsexual after undergoing an operation at the age of just 16 says she can't wait for the summer so she can try out a whole new wardrobe of tight fitting clothes .
The pop singer - born Tim - is well known in Germany for having started hormone replacement therapy as part of her gender transition by the age of 12 .
Now 16 , she completed Gender Reassignment Surgery in November , according to a posting on her blog .
Switch : Kim Petras is currently the world 's youngest transsexual after having gender reassignment surgery earlier this year at the age of 16
Dr Bernd Meyenburg who heads the Psychiatric Special Outpatient Clinic for Children and Adolescents with Identity Disorders at the University of Frankfurt Hospital said : ' Very few youth psychiatrists have any experience with transsexual developments .
The families wander from one psychiatrist to the next .
' I was always against such operations on children so young but after seeing how happy one of my patients was and how well adjusted after returning from having the operation abroad while still a teenager – I realised that in some cases it is the right decision .
' Kim is such a case – she always knew what she wanted . '
Kim herself said : ' Everything has changed because of this operation .
I just can't wait to put on my favourite bathing suit and go swimming like I 've never done before .
' I had to wait until my 16th birthday but once that was past I was able legally to have the operation .
Kim Petras pictured as a young boy
' I know that because of my past people will always bring up the subject , I can't get away from it .
But I hope that one day I might be better known for something else like my music . '
In Germany , such operations are not usually allowed until the patient is 18 .
However Kim managed to convince doctors when she was just 12 that she should have the surgery .
By 14 she was officially registered as a girl - and was already famous for her choice .
The costs of her procedure were covered by health insurance as her condition was officially diagnosed as an illness .
Dr Achim Wuesthof , an endocrinologist specialising in children and adolescents , who was treating Kim at a clinic in Hamburg , said that he and his colleagues felt that in this case it had been best to start earlier .
He said : ' To the best of my knowledge , Kim is the youngest sex change patient in the world .
' According to German law , two independent psychiatrists must confirm that the child is indeed transsexual and approve the sex change .
Once that has been done , it is best to start as early as possible .
' Transsexuals experience the onset of puberty , and the physical changes it brings , as a serious trauma .
' But there is a general lack of empathy with cases like Kim's , mostly because people know little about the condition .
Imagine a man that suddenly starts growing breasts or a woman that starts growing a beard against their will – that is how Kim and people like her experience puberty .
' They are not freaks , nor do they suffer mental illness .
They are simply trapped in the wrong bodies .
That is why it is best to help them as early as possible and reduce the trauma for them and their families . '
Last year Kim was signed to Joyce Records and released online her first single ' Last Forever ' .
It became a YouTube and MySpace hit .
In September - just weeks before the cosmetic surgery finalising her transition from a male to a female - she released her first commercially available single ' Fade Away ' into the German market .
Kim said : ' I was asked if I feel like a woman now – but the truth is I have always felt like a woman – I just ended up in the wrong body .
' I had a problem because I could n't wear skinny stuff , but now I can wear whatever I want to .
I really am looking forward to going swimming like everyone else and to wearing tight jeans that show off my figure .
They are so tight , I always felt quite uncomfortable in them until now .
' Now I can go as tight as I want to .
I used to wear mini skirts too , but yes , now even the tight ones can be part of my wardrobe .
' I can enjoy swimming , and bikinis , go in the changing rooms without a problem , everything has changed because of this operation .
I just can't wait to put on my favourite bathing suit and go swimming like I 've never done before . '
Kim , who is now studying fashion design , began calling herself a girl when she was just two years old .
Her father Lutz said : ' I suppose it took me longer than my wife to accept it , but Kim is a very persuasive girl , she knows what she wants and how to get it .
' I am very proud of what she has achieved , how she has managed to get there and how she sticks to her dreams no matter how hard and painful they are to follow . '
This project is the natural evolution of the “ standard ” version described in the previous page .
The idea is quite simple : we have a micro capable to trigger the camera , why not to program it to shoot a picture , automatically , at a regular intervals ?
This function is often called “ intervalometer ” and is mostly used for time - lapse photography .
The use of an intervalometer , however , is n't limited to realizing slow - motion videos .
It can be used , for example , for capturing events like lighting , an animal eating , detecting footprints ( see intervalometer - detects - footprints ) and whatever else you can think up .
My intention was to realize a pocket - size circuit , simple and quick to set up .
For this reason you wo n’t find any kind of display , buttons or numeric keyboard .
The minimal requirements are : a power switch ( the remote control must work “ stand - alone ” , no human key press will be needed ) , a system to change the time intervals , a manual push button ( so we wo n't need a second manual , remote control ) .
For the time selector I used a 10 position rotary BCD switch .
It has 4 output bits that can be connected directly to the microcontroller .
The power supply needs some changes .
A small CR2032 is n't enough to keep the circuit powered for many hours , so I opted for a 9V battery .
An alternative choice could be 2 or 3 AAA batteries , but I was unable to fit them in the plastic box I want to use .
As mentioned previously , a similar circuit will probably be kept on for a long time ( unlike a standard remote control , turned off after one shot ) , so is it interesting to reduce the global power consumption .
Simple changes I made from the standard version are :
- Slower crystal clock : now 4 MHz ( I have n't found 1 or 2 MHz at a reasonable price )
- Software interrupt for timing , so is it possible to use sleep during pauses
- Less current for the IR led .
This remote control is probably always used not too far from the camera .
- To reduce the 9 volts I used an LM3936 - 5 voltage regulator , but you can use a 78L05 or similar ( in this case the current consumption will be about 2 milliamperes more ) .
A new function I introduced via software is the “ manual continuous shooting ” : keeping the push button pressed , the camera is triggered continuously with no pause .

The final result of my new project is shown in the figure below .
The source code or the compiled program is not available for free .

Being a parent of two means playing the part of occasional mentor to my soon - to - be - a - parent friends .
In fact , no less than 5 of my friends will have welcomed their first child into the world this year and each of them has come to me at some time with questions about how to prepare .
Most often , I ’m asked a general question such as , “ What ’s it like ? ” or “ Were you scared ? ” Sometimes I ’ll be asked something more useful like , “ What brand of diapers do you prefer ? ”
But no one has asked me the most important question , “ How can I make preparing for baby less expensive ? ”
If one of them were finally ask me this , here ’s what I ’d tell them to avoid :
Burp Cloths
I was amazed at the things one of my friends put on her baby registry , but the one thing that really caught my eye was a set of 2 “ designer ” burp cloths for $ 14 .
Seriously ?
$ 7 for a 27 square inch piece of colored material on which your child will be depositing various bodily fluids ?
That ’s a big waste of money .
Instead of spending that much ( or asking other people to by putting it on your registry ) , consider buying cloth diapers .
For $ 11 , you can buy a pack of 12 cotton cloth diapers that will literally last you for years and serve a number of purposes .
We bought 36 diapers before our first daughter was born and they ’ve seen way more than $ 30 worth of use .
They ’ve served as burp cloths , backup diapers , mild day nap blankets , bibs for messy meals , and so much more .
Just avoid single - purpose burp cloths altogether and save your money .
Diaper Genie
Diapers stink , but they ’re not that bad .
You honestly get used to many of the smelly , messy substances your child creates very quickly because you have to .
Paying $ 40 for a glorified garbage pail and then $ 6 per “ refill ” of trash bags is quite literally throwing your money away .
Before the birth of our first child , we got a second - hand Diaper Champ at a garage sale for $ 5 and that uses regular kitchen - size trash bags .
It does n’t smell , it locks the diapers away safely , and it ’s simple enough to use that my 2 - year - old can throw her own diapers away .
And since the birth of our second child , we ’ve been content to throw ( non- stinky ) diapers in the covered kitchen trash can rather than take up space in the diaper pail .
You just do n’t need an expensive setup to dispose of your child ’s disposables .
Baby Wipe Warmers
Baby wipe warmers are one of those things that clever marketers came up with to make parents think they ’re doing something good for their child .
All it does is sit there and waste electricity keeping disposable wet wipes slightly warmer than room temperature until you whip one out to clean up your messy child .
This one gets double negative points for wasting your money up - front and wasting electricity ( and money ) over time .
That wet wipe you ’re holding is going to be in contact with your child ’s skin on average no more than 5 seconds before it is thrown away in favor of a fresh , clean wipe .
Do you think it ’s going to make a huge difference to your child if it ’s 72 degrees or 95 ?
Name Brand Clothes
Have you ever heard of one infant commenting that her playmate ’s clothes are “ so last year ” and “ definitely not designer ” ?
Your kid wo n’t know the difference between a $ 2 white onesie and one that costs three times as much because of its “ name brand ” label – and neither will his playmates .
There ’s nothing wrong with looking good , but if you ’re spending more on your child ’s wardrobe than on their future education , you need to get your vanity in check .
Along that same line , you would also be smart to avoid buying new clothes whenever possible .
Most children will outgrow their clothes long before they wear them out and money that ’s spent on an outfit that will get worn maybe 10 times should be spent wisely .
Goodwill and other thrift and consignment stores are a great place to find quality children ’s clothes .
Your child is going to soil its clothes in every imaginable way – would you rather get a shopping bag full of good clothes for $ 10 or two brand new shirts for that same price ?
Baby Shoes
They may look cute , but baby shoes are a waste .
At home , shoes are n’t needed ( and should be avoided to aid in baby ’s motor skills and development ) and when going out , the baby wo n’t be walking anyway .
With the tremendous growth spurts your child will have over its first year , you ’ll be lucky if they even scuff their shoes before they outgrow them .
As long as your child is still traveling by a carry - along car seat , they really do n’t need shoes anyway .
Socks and a blanket should be sufficient for most situations .
If you must have shoes for an occasion , I recommend picking up some slip - on booties for under $ 10 .
They come in many stylish designs , they are easy to get on the baby ’s squirmy feet , and you wo n’t be broken - hearted ( or broken - walleted ) when your child invariably loses a shoe or outgrows them .
New Furniture
Your first instinct when setting up your child ’s nursery might be to head to your nearest baby - centric store and scope out all the great baby furniture they have .
You could easily drop over $ 1,000 on a crib , changing table , and matching wardrobe or dresser if you were to buy there on the spot .
Instead of rushing out and gathering up all the newest and best furniture you can find , take your time and scour garage sales first .
We got just about everything we needed to outfit our daughter ’s nursery for $ 150 at a neighbor ’s yard sale .
You ’ll want to have a good eye for safety and double - check for recalled items , but you can easily get everything you need for a fraction of the baby store ’s retail price .
That $ 40 Mobile
Just because a mobile is expensive and looks good to you does n’t mean your child will like it .
We made that mistake with our first daughter .
We loved the musical animal mobile we bought her but she was n’t interested in it .
Trying to learn from past mistakes , my wife purchased an new mobile for our second daughter using points she earned through a survey program , but we believe even it would n’t have been worth the $ 20 at retail .
If you ’re feeling creative , you can save money and do something loving for your child by building your own baby mobile .
That way you can easily and cheaply change it if your child becomes disinterested in the scenes you picked out .
Electronic Toys
Not only do your kids not need some flashy gizmo that talks to them as they play with it , you ’ll quickly be searching for its off button to save yourself from its annoying chatter .
As soon as your child is able to grasp things , they ’ll be more interested in making noises themselves by talking or shaking a rattle .
Your child needs to learn how to self - stimulate and not be dependent on artificial , electronic baby sitters .
When they ’re little , a rattle or two and a pacifier will be sufficient to entertain them .
As they grow , blocks , books , and your pots and pans will be their new toys .
Save Your Money for What Matters
There ’s no denying that children are expensive , but many new and to - be parents make it way more expensive than it needs to be .
Keep things simple and look for bargains where you can .
Your children wo n’t suffer for lack of the “ newest and best ” .
What else do you think is a waste of money ?
Do you think I missed something ?
Am I wrong calling something a waste ?

SEOUL , South Korea - North Korea threatened military action Wednesday against U.S. and South Korean warships plying the waters near the Koreas ' disputed maritime border , raising the specter of a naval clash just days after the regime 's underground nuclear test .
In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned that Pyongyang faced unspecified consequences because of its �provocative and belligerent� acts .
Pyongyang , reacting angrily to Seoul 's decision to join an international program to intercept ships suspected of aiding nuclear proliferation , called South Korea 's decision tantamount to a declaration of war .
� Now that the South Korean puppets were so ridiculous as to join in the said racket and dare declare a war against compatriots , � North Korea is �compelled to take a decisive measure , � the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement carried by state media .
The North Korean army called it a violation of the armistice the two Koreas signed in 1953 to end their three - year war , and said it would no longer honor the treaty .
South Korea 's military said Wednesday it was prepared to �respond sternly� to any North Korean provocation .
Clinton said � there are consequences to such actions , � referring to discussions in the United Nations meant to punish North Korea for its nuclear and missile tests .
She also underscored the firmness of the U.S. treaty commitment to defend South Korea and Japan , U.S. allies in easy reach of North Korean missiles .
North Korea 's latest belligerence comes as the U.N. Security Council debates how to punish the regime for testing a nuclear bomb Monday in what President Barack Obama called a �blatant violation� of international law .
Ambassadors from the five permanent veto - wielding council members � the United States , Russia , China , Britain and France � as well as Japan and South Korea were working out the details of a new resolution .
The success of any new sanctions would depend on how aggressively China , one of North Korea 's only allies , implements them .
� It 's not going too far to say that China holds the keys on sanctions , � said Kim Sung - han , an international relations professor at Seoul 's Korea University .
South Korea , divided from the North by a heavily fortified border , had responded to the nuclear test by joining the Proliferation Security Initiative , a U.S. - led network of nations seeking to stop ships from transporting the materials used in nuclear bombs .
Seoul previously resisted joining the PSI in favor of seeking reconciliation with Pyongyang , but pushed those efforts aside Monday after the nuclear test in the northeast .
North Korea warned Wednesday that any attempt to stop , board or inspect its ships would constitute a �grave violation . �
The regime also said it could no longer promise the safety of U.S. and South Korean warships and civilian vessels in the waters near the Korea 's western maritime border .
� They should bear in mind that the ( North ) has tremendous military muscle and its own method of strike able to conquer any targets in its vicinity at one stroke or hit the U.S. on the raw , if necessary , � the army said in a statement carried by state media .
The maritime border has long been a flashpoint between the two Koreas .
North Korea disputes the line unilaterally drawn by the United Nations at the end of the Koreas ' three - year war in 1953 , and has demanded it be redrawn further south .
The truce signed in 1953 and subsequent military agreements call for both sides to refrain from warfare , but does n't cover the waters off the west coast .
North Korea has used the maritime border dispute to provoke two deadly naval skirmishes � in 1999 and 2002 .
On Wednesday , the regime promised �unimaginable and merciless punishment� for anyone daring to challenge its ships .
Pyongyang also reportedly restarted its weapons - grade nuclear plant , South Korean media said .
The Chosun Ilbo newspaper said U.S. spy satellites detected signs of steam at the North 's Yongbyon nuclear complex , an indication it may have started reprocessing nuclear fuel .
The report , which could not be confirmed , quoted an unidentified government official .
South Korea 's Yonhap news agency also carried a similar report .
The move would be a major setback for efforts aimed at getting North Korea to disarm .
North Korea had stopped reprocessing fuel rods as part of an international deal .
In 2007 , it agreed to disable the Yongbyon reactor in exchange for aid and demolished a cooling tower at the complex .
The North has about 8,000 spent fuel rods which , if reprocessed , could allow it to harvest 13 to 18 pounds ( six to eight kilograms ) of plutonium � enough to make at least one nuclear bomb , experts said .
North Korea is believed to have enough plutonium for at least a half dozen atomic bombs .
Further ratcheting up tensions , North Korea test - fired five short - range missiles over the past two days , South Korean officials confirmed .
Russia 's foreign minister said world powers must be firm with North Korea but take care to avoid inflaming tensions further .
The world �must not rush to punish North Korea just for punishment 's sake , � Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said , adding that Russia wants a Security Council resolution that will help restart stalled six-nation talks over North Korea 's nuclear programs and will not provoke Pyongyang into even more aggressive activity .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak urged officials to �remain calm� in the face of North Korean threats , said Lee Dong - kwan , his spokesman .
Pyongyang is n't afraid of any repercussions for its actions , a North Korean newspaper , the Minju Joson , said Wednesday .
� It is a laughable delusion for the United States to think that it can get us to kneel with sanctions , � it said in an editorial .
� We 've been living under U.S. sanctions for decades , but have firmly safeguarded our ideology and system while moving our achievements forward .
The U.S. sanctions policy toward North Korea is like striking a rock with a rotten egg . �
Israel 's deputy defence minister has called for a new invasion of Gaza and the capture of land close to the border , despite growing domestic and international concern about the conduct of the previous war .
" We need to conquer the areas from which mortar shells are being fired , " Matan Vilnai told an Israeli conference on the Gaza war last night .
" The mortar shell is the main threat , " he said .
Most were launched from within four miles ( 6 km ) of the border .
" We just need to be there , " he said .
His comments reflected a wider Israeli frustration with the results of the devastating three - week war .
Israeli forces destroyed thousands of homes and buildings and killed more than 1,400 Palestinians but failed to achieve their main goal : to halt the rockets and mortars which are still being fired into southern Israel .
Binyamin Netanyahu , who is expected to become the prime minister of a new , rightwing Israeli government within days , has decided that " toppling the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip " will be a strategic goal of his government .
The latest criticism of Israeli military conduct in Gaza comes in the wake of fresh testimony last week from Israeli soldiers who gave accounts of how Palestinian civilians were killed and their homes ransacked .
Themilitary said it would investigate the claims .
This week Richard Falk , the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories , is due to report to the UN human rights council .
An advance copy of his report is highly critical of the war , saying Israel 's " recourse to force was not legally justified given the circumstances and diplomatic alternatives available , and was potentially , a crime against peace " .
He calls for an expert inquiry into war crimes allegations against Israel .
XML 's structure is hierarchical and therefore can be displayed in a TreeView control easily .
The XMLTree program displays the elements of the XML file in a TreeView control and the attributes of the selected element in a ListView control .
Wikipedia 's definition of the Extensible Markup Language or XML is a general - purpose specification for creating custom markup languages .
It is classified as an extensible language , because it allows the user to define the mark - up elements .
XML 's purpose is to aid information systems in sharing structured data , especially via the Internet , to encode documents , and to serialize data .
Now to the code .
The load button 's click event loads the XML file selected by the user in a System .
Xml.XmlDocument object and loops through the root elements .
In each iteration a TreeNode object is created and populated using the three functions XmlNode2TreeNode , GetAttributes and FormatName , then added to the TreeView .
The XmlNode2TreeNode function is recursive , it calls itself for each child node in the XmlNode passed to it , doing the same thing the loadButton_Click event does for the root elements .
private void loadButton_Click ( object sender , EventArgs e ) { if ( openFileDialog.ShowDialog ( this ) == DialogResult .
Cancel ) return ; fileNameTextBox .
Text = openFileDialog.FileName ; xmlTreeView.Nodes .Clear ( ) ; document = new XmlDocument ( ) ; document .
Load( openFileDialog.FileName ) ; // load the XMl file // loop through the top nodes foreach ( XmlNode node in document ) { TreeNode treeNode = XmlNode2TreeNode ( node ) ; GetAttributes ( node , treeNode ) ; treeNode .
Text = FormatName ( node ) ; xmlTreeView.Nodes.Add(treeNode ) ; } xmlTreeView.ExpandAll ( ) ; } private TreeNode XmlNode2TreeNode ( XmlNode parentNode ) { TreeNode treeNode = new TreeNode ( ) ; foreach ( XmlNode childNode in parentNode .
ChildNodes ) { if ( childNode.NodeType == XmlNodeType.Element ) { TreeNode childTreeNode = new TreeNode ( ) ; if ( childNode .
ChildNodes .
Count > 0 ) childTreeNode = XmlNode2TreeNode( childNode ) ; childTreeNode .
Text = FormatName( childNode ) ; GetAttributes ( childNode , childTreeNode ) ; treeNode.
Nodes.Add(childTreeNode ) ; } } return treeNode ; }
The FormatName function returns a string formatted according to the XML standards .
If the XmlNode contains text data the string returned will be < ElementName > Data</ ElementName > .
And if the element does not contain data the value returned will be < ElementName > .
The GetAttributes function loops through the Attributes collection of the XmlNode passed to it adding them to an array of ListViewItems .
The Tag property of the TreeNode object passed in the second parameter is assigned the array .
This way the array can be inserted into the ListView on the right side of the form by just casting the Tag property .
private string FormatName ( XmlNode node ) { string fullName = " < " + node .
Name ; if ( node .
InnerText != " " ) fullName += " > " + node .
InnerText + " </ " + node .
Name + " > " ; else fullName += " > " ; return fullName ; } private void GetAttributes ( XmlNode node , TreeNode treeNode ) { if ( node .
Attributes != null ) { ListViewItem [ ] attributes = new ListViewItem[node .
Attributes .

Attributes .
Count ; i++) { attributes [ i ] = new ListViewItem ( new string [ ] { node .
Attributes [ i ] .
Name , node .
Attributes [ i ]. Value } ) ; } treeNode .
Tag = attributes ; } } private void xmlTreeView_NodeMouseClick ( object sender , TreeNodeMouseClickEventArgs e ) { attributesListView.Items .Clear( ) ; if ( e. Node .

MILAN ( Reuters ) - If Fiat SpA fails to clinch a deal with Chrysler LLC , it may turn to the latter ’s bigger rival General Motors Corp ( GM ) to gain the scale it needs to survive the worst industry crisis in decades .
Visitors walk on the Fiat booth during the second media day of the 79th Geneva Car Show at the Palexpo in Geneva in this March 4 , 2009 file photo .
REUTERS / Denis Balibouse
GM has a strong presence in Fiat ’s main markets of Europe and Latin America and already shares parts with the Italian group on models such as the Corsa and Grande Punto .
“ That ( a deal with GM ) would make sense , ” said SG Securities analyst Eric - Alain Michelis .
Fiat has more to gain from a deal with GM than with Chrysler because it is in the same market segments for small - and medium - sized cars as GM and could target greater economies of scale , Michelis said .
Chrysler , on the other hand , does not offer Fiat any cost savings because their businesses barely overlapped , he said .
PSA Peugeot - Citroen is also seen as a good match for Fiat , but a merger with the French car maker would be politically sensitive because the overlaps in their activities would lead to lay - offs and plant closures in both countries .
A deal with a premium brand like BMW or Daimler AG has been mentioned and would create a group with a product range from cheap and cheerful to costly and classy .
But the last big deal between a mass - market car maker and a premium brand was Daimler ’s 1998 deal with Chrysler -- a costly combination that eventually came undone .
CASH FREE
Whatever the arrangement Fiat would work out with an alternate partner to Chrysler , no money would have to change hands , according to UBS Warburg analyst Philippe Houchois .
One reason is that nobody has any to spend .
Should car sales resume their fall , despite government incentives -- as shown by PSA ’s latest sales figures -- car makers would look at other ways to make a deal to share costs and reduce cash burn .
“ They can do paper deals , ” Houchois said .
In the proposed Chrysler deal , no cash would change hands .
Instead ,
Fiat is offering technology and access to foreign markets in exchange for an entry into the U.S. market and a minority stake in the struggling U.S. group .
Faced with an April 30 deadline , Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne is working to get the support of Chrysler ’s reluctant creditors and unions to close the deal .
If he fails , the U.S. government threatens to let Chrysler go bankrupt .
A source close to Fiat told Reuters on Tuesday the car maker was determined to get a deal , but Marchionne has said he was looking for other partners “ in Europe , North America , everywhere , ” in case the talks come to nothing .
Although some investors and analysts expect
Fiat to try to buy Chrysler assets on the cheap if the car maker goes bust , most expect it to look elsewhere because it does not have the funds to spend on plants , let alone refit them to make its cars .
Doubts have grown about its ability to pay off the 4.8 billion euros of debt due this year .
Ratings agencies , for instance , have downgraded its debt to junk .
For the first quarter , its net industrial debt is seen at 6.7 billion euros against 1.1 billion a year earlier , according to the median of analysts ’ estimates compiled by Fiat ahead of the publication of results on Thursday .
COST SAVINGS
In response to growing talk of a possible deal on GM ’s Opel , Fiat Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo has denied any interest , and a banker has told Reuters that Fiat ’s talks with GM did not involve the German unit .
But Max Warburton at brokerage Bernstein is convinced of the idea .
In a report , he said a combined group would boost Fiat from No. 6 to No. 2 in terms of market share in Europe and estimated cost savings at about 1.5 billion euros compared with 225 million with Chrysler .
Another GM brand that is looking for a partner is Saab , but a Milan analyst dismissed this as a possibility for Fiat .
“ After you take over Saab , what do you have ?
You put it together with ( Fiat ’s premium sports car maker ) Alfa Romeo and you have two weak brands , ” he said .
If Fiat still wants to enter to the United States without Chrysler , it could get its Indian partner Tata Motors to let it use its Land Rover and Jaguar dealerships to sell Alfa Romeo cars in the country .
SG ’s Michelis said he would not consider it a failure if Marchionne decided to pull out of the Chrysler talks .
“ He ’ll be able to keep his head high and say that he tried but the terms were not good enough for Fiat , ” he said .

Mixed messages from Washington about a possible government takeover of some big banks sent their shares swooning Friday and pulled down the overall stock market .
“ The problem is that the national leadership is having a public discussion about nationalizing the banks , ” said Jim Paulsen , chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management .
“ In essence , they ’ve created a run on bank stocks . ”
Of particular concern is that financial - service giants struggling with troubled assets could be taken over by the federal government , possibly wiping out the companies ’ current shareholders .

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn. ) told Bloomberg
News that some lenders might have to be nationalized for “ a short time , ” while committee member Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) told HuffingtonPost.com that “ failed ” banks should be nationalized and their shareholders wiped out .

The White House tried to tamp the talk about nationalization , insisting that its policy is to keep banks in private hands .
“ This administration continues to strongly believe that a privately held banking system is the correct way to go , ensuring that they are regulated sufficiently by this government , ” said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs .
And House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) called nationalization an option “ to be avoided . ”
“ We need a definitive statement , ” said Paulsen of Wells Capital .
“ Either do it or say you ’re not going to do it . ”
Also hurting stocks Friday were disappointing forecasts from retailers J.C. Penney and Lowe ’s that provided fresh evidence that the recession continues to deepen .

The Standard & Poor ’s 500 index dropped 8.89 points to 770.05 , while the tech - heavy Nasdaq slipped 1.59 points , or 0.1 % , to 1,441.23 .
Gold futures jumped above $ 1,000 an ounce Friday as investors sought shelter in the traditional hedge against economic disaster .
The metal spiked as high as $ 1,004.90 an ounce , surpassing its all - time high of $ 1,004.30 reached last March , before closing up $ 25.70 at $ 1,001.80 an ounce .
Investors also flocked to Treasuries , another perceived haven , pushing down their yields .
The benchmark 10 - year Treasury note fell to 2.77 % from Thursday ’s close of 2.85 % .
“ There ’s still a big fear factor syndrome , ” Michael Strauss , chief economist and market strategist at Commonfund , told the Associated Press .
“ There is a focus on what is happening here and now instead of six months to nine months from now . ”

Even a nine - month time horizon may be too short , said Jack Ablin , chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank .
“ I told a client today that five years from now , you would be very happy if you bought stocks today , ” he said .
“ And 18 months from now , you ’d probably make money .
But between now and then , it ’s anybody ’s guess what will happen . ”

It 's a hoax .
Anyone who claims there is any easy way to install and use Linux on a USB drive is very inexperienced with Linux and booting USB drives and the driver issues involved .
We 've been working on this type of thing for over two years .
The best alternative : download portable VirtualBox ( torrent file ) ; download a favorite Linux distro ; run the .iso on the VirtualBox and install and the virtual drive .
And even this method has the disadvantage of leaving registry entries on the host which may mean one can't even get the distro to boot .
One may ask the LH team if they thoroughly read the information and successfully installed and ran a Linux version with persistence .
If so , which one .
I can only think of four distros which offer persistence as a feature .
Ubuntu has not been one of them since way back with version 6 .
But you can try with all your extra time .
When VDI images for VirtualBox are already made at VeeDeeEyes , I can't see any reason to not use a portable VirtualBox — nice speed .
Good luck .
An orbiting observatory may have found the first indirect evidence of dark matter particles colliding in space and disappearing , as if in a puff of smoke .
The “ smoke ” in this case consists of positrons , the antimatter counterpart of electrons .
The constant rain of energetic particles that bombards the Earth ’s surface , known as cosmic rays , contains many more positrons than scientists expected , according to a study in Nature Wednesday .
All theories agree that dark matter must give this signal , an increasing of number of positrons , ” said Piergiorgio Picozza of the University of Rome , leader of the study .
Positrons and other particles of antimatter can enter the stream of cosmic rays in three ways .
One is for cosmic rays to collide with stray atoms in interstellar space , producing a shower of particles .
Known as a
“ secondary source , ” this process is similar to what happens inside particle accelerators , and scientists presumed it was where most positrons came from .
Another possibility is that they are produced in the magnetic fields of pulsars , rapidly spinning stellar leftovers from supernova explosions , or microquasars , small , distant galaxies with active cores .
The third and most exciting option is the collision of dark matter particles .
The top candidates for dark matter , the heavy but invisible stuff that makes up 23 percent of the universe , are weakly - interacting massive particles .
Contrary to their WIMPy name , when two of these particles collide , they annihilate each other in a burst of energy and propel a cloud of matter and antimatter particles into space .
The theory has been a favorite of physicists for years , but until now , no one had detected evidence of these collisions .
To measure the abundance of positrons in cosmic rays , the team used data from the instrument PAMELA ( Payload for Antimatter Matter
Exploration and Light - nuclei Astrophysics ) , which launched aboard a Russian satellite in June 2006 .
Unlike previous antimatter - hunting instruments , PAMELA can pinpoint not just the type of incoming particle but also its energy .
The team calculated the fraction of incoming particles that positrons at several different energies accounted for .
They found that as the energy went up , so did the percentage of positrons .
This upswing rules out secondary sources as the main source of positrons , and bolsters the case for dark matter .
This is n’t the first time this idea has come up .
In August , the PAMELA team cautiously presented these results at two conferences in Stockholm and Philadelphia , sparking a flurry of activity in the physics world .
Some enterprising physicists snapped photos of the presentation ’s slides and extracted the data to analyze it themselves .
In response , the PAMELA team released their data on the preprint site arXiv.org in October .
More than 100 papers have come out since then , and more than half of them argue for dark matter sources .
But not so fast .
The same team published a study in February saying that a similar measurement of anti-protons could be explained just from cosmic rays hitting interstellar dust , with no need for dark matter at all .
“ The data significantly constrain contributions from exotic sources , e.g. , dark matter , ” the team wrote .
The physics community sighed — maybe it 's not dark matter after all .
This apparent contradiction does n't bother Picozza .
Both results narrow down the possibilities .
“ There are many models , ”
he said .
“ We did not see anything for anti-protons , so those models are more or less ruled out , or they have to change something .
But there remain many other models that prefer all positrons . ”
Pulsars are still an equal contender .
Other physicists are cautious about jumping on the dark matter solution .
" It ’s a very interesting find , but we do n’t know yet if we need to invoke some exotic explanations , " said physicist Yousaf
Butt of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
" There are certainly other prosaic explanations . "
More data from
PAMELA at higher energies combined with observations from other observatories will help determine which source produces more positrons .
“ Pulsars are less exotic , but still very important , ” Picozza said .
“ If this information is interpreted in the future in terms of dark matter , we made a very , very important discovery .
If it is in terms of pulsars , we did a very good experiment . ”

Journalists like to think of their work in moral or even sacred terms .
With each new layoff or paper closing , they tell themselves that no business model could adequately compensate the holy work of enriching democratic society , speaking truth to power , and comforting the afflicted .
Actually , journalists deserve low pay .
Wages are compensation for value creation .
And journalists simply are n't creating much value these days .
Until they come to grips with that issue , no amount of blogging , twittering , or micropayments is going to solve their failing business models .
Where does value come from ?
Moral philosophers differentiate intrinsic and instrumental value .
Intrinsic value involves things that are good in and of themselves , such as beauty , truth , and harmony .
Instrumental value comes from things that facilitate action and achievement , including awareness , belonging , and understanding .
Journalism produces only instrumental value .
It is important not in itself , but because it enlightens the public , supports social interaction , and facilitates democracy .
Economic value is rooted in worth and exchange .
It is created when finished products and services have more value – as determined by consumers – than the sum of the value of their components .
To comprehend journalistic value creation , we need to focus on the benefits it provides .
Journalism creates functional , emotional , and self - expressive benefits for consumers .
Functional benefits include providing useful information and ideas .
Emotional benefits include a sense of belonging and community , reassurance and security , and escape .
Self - expressive benefits are provided when individuals identify with the publication 's perspectives or opinions , or when they 're empowered to express their own ideas .
These benefits used to produce significant economic value .
Not today .
That 's because producers and providers have less control over the communication space than ever before .
In the past , the difficulty and cost of operation , publication , and distribution severely limited the number of content suppliers .
This scarcity raised the economic value of content .
That additional value is gone today because a far wider range of sources of news and information exist .
The primary value that is created today comes from the basic underlying value of the labor of journalists .
Unfortunately , that value is now near zero .
The total value is the value of content plus the value of advertising .
However , advertisers do n't care about journalism – only the audience that it produces .
Thus the real measure of journalistic value is value created by serving readers .
What are journalists worth ?
Economic outcomes have traditionally held low priority for journalists .
That 's got to change .
Journalists are not professionals with a unique base of knowledge such as professors or electricians .
Consequently , the primary economic value of journalism derives not from its own knowledge , but in distributing the knowledge of others .
In this process three fundamental functions and related skills have historically created economic value : Accessing sources , determining significance of information , and conveying it effectively .
Accessing sources is crucial because information and knowledge do not exist as a natural resource that merely has to be harvested .
It must be constructed by someone .
The journalistic skill of identifying and reaching authorities or others who construct expertise traditionally gave journalists opportunities to report in ways that the general public could not .
Determining significance has been critical because journalists sort through an enormous amount of information to find the most significant and interesting items for consumers .
Effective presentation involves the ability to reduce information to its core to meet space and time requirements and presenting it in an interesting and attractive manner .
These are built on linguistic and artistic skills and formatting techniques .
Today all this value is being severely challenged by technology that is " de- skilling " journalists .
It is providing individuals – without the support of a journalistic enterprise – the capabilities to access sources , to search through information and determine its significance , and to convey it effectively .
To create economic value , journalists and news organizations historically relied on the exclusivity of their access to information and sources , and their ability to provide immediacy in conveying information .
The value of those elements has been stripped away by contemporary communication developments .
Today , ordinary adults can observe and report news , gather expert knowledge , determine significance , add audio , photography , and video components , and publish this content far and wide ( or at least to their social network ) with ease .
And much of this is done for no pay .
Until journalists can redefine the value of their labor above this level , they deserve low pay .
Well - paying employment requires that workers possess unique skills , abilities , and knowledge .
It also requires that the labor must be non-commoditized .
Unfortunately , journalistic labor has become commoditized .
Most journalists share the same skills sets and the same approaches to stories , seek out the same sources , ask similar questions , and produce relatively similar stories .
This interchangeability is one reason why salaries for average journalists are relatively low and why columnists , cartoonists , and journalists with special expertise ( such as finance reporters ) get higher wages .
Across the news industry , processes and procedures for news gathering are guided by standardized news values , producing standardized stories in standardized formats that are presented in standardized styles .
The result is extraordinary sameness and minimal differentiation .
It is clear that journalists do not want to be in the contemporary labor market , much less the highly competitive information market .
They prefer to justify the value they create in the moral philosophy terms of instrumental value .
Most believe that what they do is so intrinsically good and that they should be compensated to do it even if it does n't produce revenue .
A century and half ago , journalists were much closer to the market and more clearly understood they were sellers of labor in the market .
Before professionalism of journalism , many journalists not only wrote the news , but went to the streets to distribute and sell it and few journalists had regular employment in the news and information business .
Journalists and social observers debated whether practicing journalism for a news entity was desirable .
Even Karl Marx argued that " The first freedom of the press consists in it not being a trade . "
Adapt or die
If the news business is to survive , we must find ways to alter journalism 's practice and skills to create new economic value .
Journalism must innovate and create new means of gathering , processing , and distributing information so it provides content and services that readers , listeners , and viewers cannot receive elsewhere .
And these must provide sufficient value so audiences and users are willing to pay a reasonable price .
If value is to be created , journalists cannot continue to report merely in the traditional ways or merely re-report the news that has appeared elsewhere .
They must add something novel that creates value .
They will have to start providing information and knowledge that is not readily available elsewhere , in forms that are not available elsewhere , or in forms that are more useable by and relevant to their audiences .
One cannot expect newspaper readers to pay for page after page of stories from news agencies that were available online yesterday and are in a thousand other papers today .
Providing a food section that pales by comparison to the content of food magazines or television cooking shows is not likely to create much value for readers .
Neither are scores of disjointed , undigested short news stories about events in far off places .
Some news magazines have confronted the issue and are already changing and trying to provide unique news content .
Newsweek has moved away from creating a compendium of events to a publication that explores the issues and implications of events and trends .
US News & World Report has emphasized its consumer review and rankings activities .
Daily newspapers do n't have quite as much leeway with content but they can emphasize uniqueness .
The Boston Globe , for example , could become the national leader in education and health reporting because of the multitude of higher education and medical institutions in its coverage area .
Not only would it make the paper more valuable to readers , but it could sell that coverage to other publications .
Similarly , The Dallas Morning News could provide specialized coverage of oil and energy , The Des Moines Register could become the leader in agricultural news ; and the Chicago Tribune in airline and aircraft coverage .
Every paper will have to be the undisputed leader in terms of their quality and quantity of local news .
Finding the right formula of practice , functions , skills , and business model will not be easy , but the search must be undertaken .
It is not just a matter of embracing uses of new technologies .
Journalists today are often urged to change practice to embrace crowd sourcing , to search specialty websites , social networks , blogs , and micro-blogs for story ideas , and to embrace in collaborative journalism with their audiences .
Although all of these provide useful new ways to find information , access knowledge , and engage with readers , listeners , and viewers , the amount of value that they add and its monetization is highly debatable .
The primary reason is that those who are most highly interested in that information and knowledge are able to harvest it themselves using increasingly common tools .
Finding the rights means to create and protect value will require collaboration throughout news enterprises .
It is not something that journalists can leave to management .
Journalists and managers alike will need to develop collaboration skills and create social relations that make it possible .
Journalists will also need to acquire entrepreneurial and innovation skills that makes it possible for them to lead change rather than merely respond to it .
The demise of the news business can be halted , but only if journalists commit to creating value for consumers and become more involved in setting the course of their companies .

Daniel Reetz posted an Instructable about making your high - speed book scanner from trash and cheap cameras .
His version is only around $ 300 .
I do n't think I 'd make one myself , but I 'd love for some generous maker to install one at my local public library !
From Instructables :
Digital books change the landscape .
After suffering through scanning many of my old , rare , and government issue books , I decided to create a book scanner that anybody could make , for around $ 300 .
And that 's what this instructable is all about .
A greener future with more books rather than fewer books .
More access to information , rather than less access to information .
And maybe , years from now , a reformed publishing / distribution model ( but I 'm not holding my breath … ) .
I 've built two of these things now , and this instructable covers the best parts of both of them .
You can build a book scanner using only hand tools plus a drill .
I realized that not everyone is comfortable with using all the different hand tools you might need to make it .
So I scanned a book on using hand tools that should answer all your questions . ;)
Pretty much the only question you need to ask yourself these days when listening to a Republican member of Congress speak is : “ Are they lying or just plain stupid ? ”
Speaking in front of Congress today , Rep. Virginia Fox ( R - NC ) not only proved herself to be both a liar and an idiot , she also desecrated the memory of Matthew Shepard , who was killed in a horrific anti-gay hate crime back in 1998 .
Not only that , she did it all in front of Matthew Shepard ’s grieving mother !
First , to the question of whether Rep .
Foxx is an idiot .
Read this story from Gleen Greenwald and figure out the answer for yourself :
The House of Representatives today is debating a hate crimes bill which , among other things , would impose heightened penalties for crimes “ motivated by prejudice based on the actual or perceived race , color , religion , national origin , gender , sexual orientation , gender identity , or disability of the victim . ”
One of the GOP leaders opposing the bill on the House floor is Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina , and — bizarrely and rather amusingly — she decided to feature something I wrote as a basis for her opposition to the bill …
When I began receiving emails earlier today informing me that Rep .
Foxx had cited me as an eloquent and steadfast opponent of hate crimes laws , I was rather surprised , since I ’m quite certain I ’ve never before said or written a word about hate crimes laws .
I was therefore confounded that I was being praised for my moving opposition to this bill .
This blogger has solved the mystery .
The post that Rep .
Foxx is quoting is one which condemns hate speech laws .
That is why its title is “ The Noxious Fruits of Hate Speech laws . ”
It has nothing to do with hate crimes legislation .
Hate speech laws and hate crimes laws are entirely different , since the former punishes the pure expression of ideas while the latter involves the commission of actual crimes , usually quite violent and serious crimes .
One can easily and coherently oppose the former but support the latter .
If the above proves that Rep .
Foxx is a drooling idiot , add the following evidence to the pile on the question of whether she ’s also a shameless liar and a cruel , heartless political opportunist :
As the House of Representatives debates an expansion of hate crimes legislation , Rep. Virginia Foxx ( R - N.C. ) has taken the rhetoric to a new level , claiming that those who say Matthew Shepard was murdered in Wyoming for being gay are perpetrating a “ hoax ” on the American people .
“ I also would like to point out that there was a bill — the hate crimes bill that ’s called the Matthew Shepard bill is named after a very unfortunate incident that happened where a young man was killed , but we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery .
It was n’t because he was gay .
This — the bill was named for him , hate crimes bill was named for him , but it ’s really a hoax that that continues to be used as an excuse for passing these bills , ” said Foxx .
To literally add insult to injury , it turns out that Matthew Shepard ’s MOTHER was in the gallery when the heartless Rep .
Foxx was callously dishonoring her son ’s memory :
“ Matthew Shepard ’s mother was in the gallery yesterday and I believe she was back today — so I ’m sorry she had to be around to hear it , ” said Rep. Steve Cohen ( D - Tenn . ) .
“ It ’s an urban myth …
And I ’d tell her that man did land on the moon and the moon was n’t made out of green cheese . ”
Regardless of Rep .
Foxx ’s fact - free claims to the contrary , Matthew Shepard was in fact killed in an incident of anti-gay violence :
The New York Times reported in 1998 : “ According to the local police and prosecutors , the two men lured Mr. Shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay .
Then , the Laramie police say , the pair kidnapped Mr. Shepard , pistol - whipped him with a .357 Magnum , and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hours until a passing bicyclist spotted Mr. Shepard , who was unconscious . ”
Reps .
John Lewis and Debbie Wasserman - Shultz called out Rep .
Foxx for her despicable bullshit :
“ She should be ashamed , ” said Rep. John Lewis ( D - Ga. ) , himself a victim of a hate crime during the struggle for civil rights .
“ That is unreal , unbelievable .
The law enforcement people and almost every reasonable person I know believes he was murdered because he was gay . ”
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla. ) , stared in disbelief before answering a question about the statement .
“ It ’s just sad the Republican caucus has been reduced such a fringe , ” she said .
“ It ’s sad they would go out of their way to prevent people from getting justice . ”
The fact that we let drooling , cruel barely - sentient idiots like this through the door of the Capitol building never ceases to amaze me .
Update :
Not to be outdone , the other members of the Heartless GOP Assholes Brigade stepped up to the plate today and whipped themselves up in an orgy of paranoid , hate - inspired rhetoric :
REP MICHELE BACHMANN ( R-MN ) : I feel that this hate crime legislation could be considered the very definition of tyranny .
REP .
GRESHMAN BARRET ( R-SC ) :
This bill would inhibit religious freedom in our society — a scary thought .
REP .
LOUIE GOHMERT ( R - TX ) :
You think a pregnant mother does not deserve the protection of a homosexual ?
You think a military member does n’t deserve the protection of a transvestite ?
REP .
STEVE KING ( R- IA ) : I , Mr. Speaker , oppose and I defy the logic of the people that would advocate for such legislation the very idea we could divine what goes on in the heads of people when they commit crimes .
These people need to be locked away in a padded room — with nothing but gay nurses .

HOW TO
Science fiction application is based on set - design , but on a permanent basis .
Some would say it's all done with ' smoke & mirrors ' in order to sell the illusion and keep the cost down as many television and film productions work on tight budgets - especially when it comes to set - design .
There are no special materials needed to achieve what you see on this site - just a passion for science fiction and taking that passion to create a unique design using locally sourced materials - most of which are readily available .
However , and this is a question I get asked often , ' do I need to be skilled to achieve the transformation ? '
My answer is ; first , you absolutely must have the passion for the project before you undertake any work - without it , you 'll either make too many mistakes which will lead to you losing interest in your project which will result in it becoming a costly project .
Secondly , know your skill limitations - if you are not sure how to tackle a particular job , do what I do ... search the internet - do some research , but only if you are serious about what you want to achieve .
Basic skills : Carpentry , a reasonable knowledge of electronics , using a soldering iron with printed circuit boards ( PCB ) and patience - without it you will struggle to achieve the desired result .
Before you embarked on any aspect of science fiction application , you should study it from all angles so as to limit any possible errors along the way .
It will also give you time to include any enhancements you may want to apply .
Keep mistakes to a minimum .
Baddraw 's first gaming gig since 1987 will do little to silence his critics .
In a disturbing new trend , the economic recession has pushed thousands of 3D modelers into unemployment and lead high - profile game publishers to reissue low - budget box art " demakes " of their popular software .
While this drastic reduction in budgets and expectations has proven disastrous for the industry 's top artists , a previously marginalized group of freelance , cut -rate hacks has surfaced to monopolize what assignments are still available .
The first previously aesthetically respectable cover to get thrown to this stagnant cesspool of haplessly talentless designers was Halo 3 Former Mega Man NES box artist Rodney Baddraw , whose Mega Man work is routinely voted " worst box art in videogame history , " was lazily trawling Craigslist for freelance gigs when he stumbled upon Bungie 's ad .
Being the only designer to agree to the payment terms of 800 MS points and a Cortana4 Life temporary tattoo , he happily took the assignment .
As you can see , the results are already horrifying .
Worse yet are his plans to butcher even more modern classics with his unique neglect of perspective , anatomy , color scheme and any logical cohesive relation to the actual game in question .
We 're in his hell now .
Stay tuned .
Yesterday we showed you the Top 10 Greatest Pontiacs Of All Time .
Coming up with 10 great Pontiacs was both fun and easy , as the brand is responsible for some of the best muscle cars ever made .
During its heyday , Pontiac was so good that the entire brand won the Motor Trend Car of the Year award three times .
Unfortunately , the oil embargo ruined Pontiac 's fun , and " Driving Excitement " was converted into a ragtag collection of badge - engineered mediocrity .
While we 're still nostalgic about the dying Pontiac brand , we decided to augment our original list with the Top 10 Worst Pontiacs Of All Time .
There were plenty of models from which to choose , and we managed to remember the least loved Pontiac of all time : the Aztek .

Treasury secretary Tim Geithner said again today that he plans on imposing conditions on banks that want to wriggle free of government control by repaying bailout funds .
As we explained yesterday , this seems to fly in the face of a provision of the stimulus bill signed into law earlier this year which specifically prohibits the government from imposing conditions .
What makes Geithner think he can impose conditions in violation of this law ?
The blog DearJohnThain points to the TARP Purchase Agreement , the contract banks signed in October when they agreed to take bailout funds in exchange for granting preferred shares and warrants to the goverment .
The contract says that redemption of the preferred shares is " subject to the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency . "
( Click here to download a PDF of Goldman 's Purchase Agreement and here for JPM 's agreement . )
It goes on to describe a specific requirement that the repayment can only be made with the proceeds from a " Qualified Equity Offering , " which is defined as selling perpetual perferred or common stock that can be counted as Tier 1 Capital .
" So , it seems pretty clear that there are conditions , " DJT concludes .
We 're not sure that 's clear at all .
First of all , there 's nothing in the contract that authorizes Geithner to prohibit a redemption until he is satisfied with the overall health of the financial system .
That condition seems to have been created out of the air by the Treasury Secretary .
We do n't think the words " subject to the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency " creates a blank check for the Treasury Secretary to impose whatever conditions he wants .
Second , Tim Geithner is not the " Appropraite Federal Banking Agency " for either Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan .
Neither is the Treasury Department .
That term refers to an agency designated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act , which says that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is the appropriate agency .
So if anyone is empowered to put conditions on the repayment , it is the Fed .
And last we heard , the Fed does n't answer to the Treasury .
What 's more , it 's unclear whether this condition is still applicable .
Goldman Sachs seems to believe it is applicable .
It went out and raised capital in a way that would count as a " Qualified Equity Offering . "
JP Morgan , however , has taken the opposite view , saying it would pay back the TARP without raising capital .
CEO Jamie Dimon said he does n't see any need to raise new capital and did n't see why Goldman did it either .
Why would the condition no longer apply ?
Because the stimulus bill - - or , more formally , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 - - was passed after the contract was signed .
So the prohibition on putting impediments to TARP replayment would seem to nullify the contractual provision .
We think that it 's possible that the government cannot legally enforce the requirement for new equity .
So the quetion become whether or not Goldman or JP Morgan would risk defying Geithner by paying back the TARP without his permission ?
And also : how did this provision wind up in the stimulus bill ?
ON MAY 19th Californians will go to the polls to vote on six ballot measures that are as important as they are confusing .
If these measures fail , America 's biggest state will enter a full - blown financial crisis that will require excruciating cuts in public services .
If the measures succeed , the crisis will be only a little less acute .
Recent polls suggest that voters are planning to vote most of them down .
The occasion has thus become an ugly summary of all that is wrong with California 's governance , and that list is long .
This special election , the sixth in 36 years , came about because the state 's elected politicians once again — for the system virtually assures as much — could not agree on a budget in time and had to cobble together a compromise in February to fill a $ 42 billion gap between revenue and spending .
But that compromise required extending some temporary taxes , shifting spending around and borrowing against future lottery profits .
These are among the steps that voters must now approve , thanks to California 's brand of direct democracy , which is unique in extent , complexity and misuse .
A good outcome is no longer possible .
California now has the worst bond rating among the 50 states .
Income - tax receipts are coming in far below expectations .
On May 11th Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor , sent a letter to the legislature warning it that , by his latest estimates , the state will face a budget gap of $ 15.4 billion if the ballot measures pass , $ 21.3 billion if they fail .
Prisoners will have to be released , firefighters fired , and other services cut or eliminated .
One way or the other , on May 20th Californians will have to begin discussing how to fix their broken state .
California has a unique combination of features which , individually , are shared by other states but collectively cause dysfunction .
These begin with the requirement that any budget pass both houses of the legislature with a two - thirds majority .
Two other states , Rhode Island and Arkansas , have such a law .
But California , where taxation and budgets are determined separately , also requires two - thirds majorities for any tax increase .
Twelve other states demand this .
Only California , however , has both requirements .
If its representative democracy functioned well , that might not be so debilitating .
But it does not .
Only a minority of Californians bother to vote , and those voters tend to be older , whiter and richer than the state 's younger , browner and poorer population , says Steven Hill at the New America Foundation , a think - tank that is analysing the options for reform .
Those voters , moreover , have over time “ self - sorted ” themselves into highly partisan districts : loony left in Berkeley or Santa Monica , for instance ; rabid right in Orange County or parts of the Central Valley .
Politicians have done the rest by gerrymandering bizarre boundaries around their supporters .
The result is that elections are won during the Republican or Democratic primaries , rather than in run-offs between the two parties .
This makes for a state legislature full of mad-eyed extremists in a state that otherwise has surprising numbers of reasonable citizens .
And that is why sensible and timely budgets have become almost impossible , says Jim Wunderman , president of the Bay Area Council , an association of corporate bosses .
Because the Republicans are in a minority in the legislature , they have no sway until budget time , when they suddenly hold veto power thanks to the two - thirds requirement .
Because in the primaries they have run on extremist platforms against other Republicans , they have no incentive to be pragmatic or moderate , and tend simply to balk .
What was unusual about this year 's deadlock was only its “ record lateness ” , says Mr Wunderman , which amounted to an “ anti- stimulus ” that negated much of the economic - recovery plan coming from Washington , DC .
“ No real conversation is possible on anything that matters , ” he says , whether it be California 's fraught water supply , its barbaric prison conditions or its teetering public education .
Representative democracy is only one half of California 's peculiar governance system .
The other half , direct democracy , fails just as badly .
California is one of 24 states that allow referendums , recalls and voter initiatives .
But it is the only state that does not allow its legislature to override successful initiatives ( called “ propositions ” ) and has no sunset clauses that let them expire .
It also uses initiatives far more , and more irresponsibly , than any other state .
Direct democracy in America originated , largely in the Western states , during the Populist and then Progressive eras of the late 19th and early 20th century .
It came to California in 1911 , when Governor Hiram Johnson introduced it .
At first , it made sense .
The Southern Pacific Railroad dominated politics , society and the courts in the young frontier state , and direct democracy would be a welcome check and balance .
The state in 1910 had only 2.4 m residents , and 95 % of them were white .
( Today it has about 37 m residents , and less than half are white . )
A small , homogenous and informed electorate was to make sparing and disciplined use of the ballot to keep the legislature honest , rather as in Switzerland .
Citizen - power gone mad
Sparing and disciplined it stayed until the 1970s .
But then came a decade of polarisation and voter mistrust .
In 1978 Californians sparked a nationwide “ tax revolt ” by passing Proposition 13 , which drastically limited property taxes and placed a permanent straitjacket on state revenues .
That launched an entire industry of signature - gatherers and marketing strategists that now puts an average of ten initiatives a year on the ballot , as Mark Baldassare , the boss of the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California , has calculated .
In 2003 direct democracy reached a new zenith — or nadir , some might say — when Californians “ recalled ” their elected and sitting governor , Gray Davis , and replaced him with Mr Schwarzenegger .
The minority of eligible Californians who vote not only send extremists to Sacramento , but also circumscribe what those representatives can do by deciding many policies directly .
It is the voters who decide , for instance , to limit legislators ' terms in office , to mandate prison terms for criminals , to withdraw benefits from undocumented immigrants , to spend money on trains or sewers , or to let Indian tribes run casinos .
Through such “ ballot - box budgeting ” , a large share of the state 's revenues is spoken for before budget negotiations even begin .
“ The voters get mad when they vote to spend a ton of money and the legislature can't then find the money , ” says Jean Ross of the California Budget Project , a research outfit in Sacramento .
Indeed , voters being mad is the one constant ; the only proposition that appears certain to pass on May 19th would punish legislators with pay freezes in budget - deficit years .
More than half of the initiatives do n't pass , and some that do are sensible .
But much of the system has been perverted into the opposite of what Hiram Johnson intended .
It is not ordinary citizens but rich tycoons from Hollywood or Silicon Valley , or special interests such as unions for prison guards , teachers or nurses , that bankroll most initiatives onto the ballots .
Then comes a barrage of television commercials , junk mail and robo-calls that leave no Californian home unmolested and the great majority confused .
Propositions tend to be badly worded , with double negatives that leave some voters thinking they voted for something when they really voted against .
One eloquent English teacher in Los Angeles recently called a radio show complaining that , after extensive study , she could not understand the ballot measures on grounds of syntax .
The broken budget mechanism and the twin failures in California 's representative and direct democracy are enough to guarantee dysfunction .
The sheer complexity of the state exacerbates it .
Peter Schrag , the author of “ California : America 's High - Stakes Experiment ” , has counted about 7,000 overlapping jurisdictions , from counties and cities to school and water districts , fire and park commissions , utility and mosquito - abatement boards , many with their own elected officials .
The surprise is that anything works at all .
As a result , there is now a consensus among the political elite that California 's governance is “ fundamentally broken ” and that the state is “ ungovernable , unless we make tough choices ” , as Antonio Villaraigosa , the mayor of Los Angeles and a likely candidate for governor next year , puts it .
What are those choices ?
Incremental reform , says one set of analysts .
Darrell Steinberg , a thoughtful Democrat who is the current leader of the state Senate , says that the dysfunction is often overstated , since the system was deliberately designed “ to ensure that change occurs slowly ” .
He believes that several piecemeal reforms already slated will fix most of the problem .
So does California Forward , a bipartisan think - tank supported by several of the state 's éminences grises .
A change to districting rules should end gerrymandering , starting next year .
And there is talk of open primaries in which people vote irrespective of their party affiliation , and then elect a candidate in a run - off between the top two vote - getters , whether from the same party or not .
Together , these two steps would make the state 's representative politics more moderate , says James Mayer , California Forward 's director .
Representatives should also have longer terms in office , he thinks , to reduce the permanent turnover that pits greenhorn legislators against savvy and entrenched lobbyists .
Founding fathers wanted
Many others , however , now believe that California needs to start from scratch , with a fully - fledged constitutional convention .
California 's current constitution rivals India 's and Alabama 's for being the longest and most convoluted in the world , and is several times longer than America's .
It has been amended or revised more than 500 times and now , with the cumulative dross of past voter initiatives incorporated , is a document that assures chaos .
Calls for a new constitution have resurfaced throughout the past century , but never went far .
That changed last August , as the budget negotiations were once again going off the rails , when Mr Wunderman of the Bay Area Council renewed the call for a convention and received an astonishing outpouring of support .
Mr Schwarzenegger has called a constitutional convention “ a brilliant idea ” and thinks it is “ the right way to go ” .
( The new constitution would take effect well after he leaves office . )
Most encouragingly , says Mr Wunderman , nobody , not even the so - called special interests , has yet come out against a convention .
To the extent that there is scepticism at all , it is not about the idea of a new and cleaner constitution but about the process that might lead to it .
If a convention set out to rewrite the entire constitution , it would end in the usual war over hot - button social issues such as gay marriage or the perennial Californian fight over water .
And there is concern that “ the nutwings are the ones who will show up , not the soccer moms , ” as Ms Ross of the California Budget Project puts it .
The same partisan extremists bickering about the same controversies would lead nowhere .
To address these concerns , the Bay Area Council , which has become the driving force behind the scheme , has put forth two ideas .
First , delegates to the convention should be chosen through the general jury pool to ensure that the whole population , as opposed to partisans or voters , is represented .
Second , the scope of the constitutional convention would be explicitly limited to governance issues and the budget mechanism and would exclude all others .
This should enable reform in the most vital and interconnected areas .
These are : reducing the two - thirds requirement for budgets and taxes ; mandating two - year as opposed to annual budgets ; giving local governments more access to local revenues ; creating less partisan districts and primary elections ; disciplining the process of direct democracy with new rules about signature collection ; and introducing a “ sunset ” commission , as Texas has , that would gradually retire overlapping jurisdictions and offices to achieve something more manageable .
The plan is to introduce voter initiatives in next year 's ballot calling for a constitutional convention , to have the convention the following year , and to put the new constitution on a ballot in 2012 , when it would take effect .
In the meantime both the incrementalists , such as California Forward , and the wholesale reformers , such as the Bay Area Council , are backing the propositions on next week 's ballot .
Even if they succeed , this would only temporarily reduce the urgency for radical reform ; failure would cause intolerable pain .

Advertisement A gay minister at the centre of a row over his appointment to a church in Aberdeen has told BBC Scotland he has been " personally hurt " by the episode .
The Church of Scotland voted on Saturday evening to uphold the decision to appoint the Reverend Scott Rennie to Queen 's Cross Church .
People on both sides of the argument held demonstrations over the issue .
Mr Rennie , 37 , said the church had taken a " tentative step forward " in making its decision .
The minister , a divorced father - of - one , is currently a minister at Brechin Cathedral and said he was open with the congregation at Queen 's Cross about being gay and living with his male partner .
I 've been personally hurt and , as you can imagine , it 's made life pretty stressful
The Reverend Scott Rennie
In a late night vote on Saturday evening , the General Assembly in Edinburgh voted by 326 to 267 in support of Mr Rennie , who is the Church of Scotland 's first openly gay minister .
His appointment had been backed by a majority of the congregation at Queen 's Cross Church in Aberdeen .
Reflecting on the row , Mr Rennie told BBC Scotland 's Politics Show : " I 've been personally hurt and , as you can imagine , it 's made life pretty stressful .
" But , at the end of the day , I felt God 's call in my life to ministry , I felt God 's call to be at Queen 's Cross Parish Church in Aberdeen , the church responded to that too and , sometimes , you have to be prepared to endure a bit of heat for what you think is right and that 's just the way life is . "
In the wake of the vote , the minister said : " We did take a step forward , in a sense last night , but it was a tentative step and I recognise that .
' Great shame ' " But I think that 's because there 's a large number of people in the church who simply have n't made up their mind because there has n't really been a period in the church where we 've really discussed the issues .
" It 's like the big elephant in the room that no - one speaks about . "
Mr Rennie added : " The sad thing is , I 'm just an ordinary parish minister and I really wish none of the furore that has surrounded my appointment would have happened at all . "
Members of the Zion Baptist Church campaigned against the appointment More than 400 Kirk ministers and almost 5,000 Church of Scotland members are said to have signed an online petition against the appointment , organised by the Fellowship of Confessing Churches .
Two of those ministers , the Reverend David Court and the Reverend Dr William Philip , said in a statement that the result of the vote had " brought great shame on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and his Church by publicly proclaiming as holy what God , the Bible , and orthodox Christianity all down the ages , and all over the world , unambiguously call sin . "
The demonstration against Mr Rennie 's appointment at The Mound in Edinburgh was led by Pastor Jack Bell of the Zion Baptist Church in Glasgow .
" We are absolutely opposed to that on the basis of what God has to say about homosexuality in the Bible , " he said .
A larger counter - demonstration was held in support of Mr Rennie .
More acceptance Earlier , the Reverend Ewen Gilchrist , the interim moderator at Queen 's Cross , said there should be more acceptance .
" Sexuality is something that the church does n't have a good track record about " , he said .
" We constantly lock it up and frown about it .
Here 's an opportunity to welcome it , to acknowledge the diversity of human sexuality and to bring that richness into our life and worship . "
The Equality and Human Rights Commission Scotland said it was " delighted " with the result .
Spokeswoman Alyson Thomson , said : " The Church of Scotland General Assembly has tonight set out a clear stall - it is a modern church for a modern Scotland .
" The commission is delighted that the church has , as Scott Rennie requested , taken an honest look at itself over the issue of sexuality and decided that the values of fairness , equality , dignity and respect are of more worth than those of ignorance and intolerance .
" We are certain that this decision will be welcomed by the majority of Scots and certainly the majority of Queen 's Cross parish in Aberdeen who overwhelmingly demonstrated their support for Mr Rennie . "

Last month , Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association , a utility that provides power to mostly rural areas , agreed to conduct a major study to see if it might meet growing energy needs through energy efficiency and not a big , new coal - fired power plant , as it had proposed for southeast Colorado .
One ...
One thing I do n’t understand is what is useful about electric indentation .
This is when entering a special character such as a single or double quote or a semi-colon will automatically cause the current line to be re-indented .
I configure my programming modes to do an automatic indentation when I press the return key .
For example , in my cc-config.el file I have this line .
( define - key c- mode - base - map ( kbd " RET " ) ' newline-and - indent )
A Small Criticism of Yegge ’s Javascript Mode
Steve Yegge ’s javascript mode has a particularly unfortunate interaction with electric indentation .
He wrote :
[ Automatic indentation ] turns out to be , oh , about fifty times harder than incremental parsing .
Surprise ! …
I put a few tweaks into Karl ’s original indenter code to handle JavaScript 1.7 situations such as array comprehensions , and then wrote a " bounce indenter " that cycles among N precomputed indentation points . …
This moved the accuracy , at least for my own JavaScript editing , from 90 % accurate with Karl ’s mode up to 99.x % accurate , assuming you ’re willing to hit TAB multiple times for certain syntactic contexts .
So , how does this interact with electric indentation ?
Pretty badly .
Consider if you have the following line and the default indentation is n’t what you want .
if (... ) { var x = " some string " ; }
When you begin to enter your line , you tab it into your prefered location , then when you enter the quote for the beginning of the string , it resets the position back to the wrong place .
No problem , you fix it again but then it breaks once again when you enter the closing quote .
Suppressing your rising fury , you make the mistake of retabbing it for a third time then the semicolon at the end of the line causes another reindent and almost guarantees that you throw your PC through the window .
But , is it fixable ?
Well ,
Yegge did include a flag called js2 - auto - indent - flag but unfortunately it has to be set before the code is loaded otherwise the definition of the electric keys has already been trashed .
( defvar js2 - mode - map ( let ( ( map ( make - sparse - keymap ) ) keys ) ... ( when js2 - auto - indent - flag ( mapc ( lambda ( key ) ( define - key map key #'js2- insert-and - indent ) ) js2-electric -keys ) ) ...
The default definition of js2 - insert - and - indent does n’t check this flag so I modified my copy to enable me to change the behaviour at runtime .
( defun js2 - insert - and - indent ( key ) " Run command bound to key and indent current line .
Runs the command bound to KEY in the global keymap and indents the current line . " ( interactive ( list ( this - command - keys ) ) ) ( let ( ( cmd ( lookup - key ( current - global - map ) key ) ) ) ( if ( commandp cmd ) ( call - interactively cmd ) ) ) ;; do n't do the electric keys inside comments or strings , ;; and do n't do bounce - indent with them .
( let ( ( parse - state ( parse - partial - sexp ( point - min ) ( point ) ) ) ( js2-bounce-indent-flag ( js2 - code - at - bol - p ) ) ) ( unless ( or ( not js2 - auto - indent - flag ) ( nth 3 parse - state ) ( nth 4 parse - state ) ) ( indent- according - to- mode ) ) ) )
This is the diff :
9901c9901,9902 < ( unless ( or ( not js2 - auto - indent - flag ) --- > ( unless ( or ( nth 3 parse - state ) > ( nth 4 parse - state ) )
So , back to the initial question : Does anyone use / like electric indentation and if so , how do you get around the problem described above ( and why is auto - indent on carriage return not sufficient ) ?
Mr. Obama has repeatedly repudiated the Bush administration ; in the interviews , Mr. Cheney has hit back .
Speaking to Politico in February , he warned of a “ high probability ” of another terrorist attack .
On CNN , he suggested that Mr. Obama was using the economic crisis to justify a big expansion of government .
On Fox , he agreed when Mr. Hannity asked if Mr. Obama was “ telegraphing weakness . ”
To Democrats , Mr. Cheney is the perfect person to remind the nation of all the reasons Republicans were turned out of office .
“ I think the country has rendered a pretty clear verdict last fall on Cheney and Cheneyism , ” said Mr. Obama ’s senior adviser , David Axelrod .
Even some Republicans say they wish the former vice president would disappear .
Among them is Meghan McCain , the daughter of the Republicans ’ 2008 presidential nominee , Senator John McCain , who appeared Thursday on the ABC show “ The View . ”
“ You had your eight years , ” Ms. McCain declared .
“ Go away . ”
Other former vice presidents have kept a much lower profile , at least this early after leaving office .
Al Gore was supportive of Mr. Bush after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , but in September 2002 delivered a speech critical of Mr. Bush ’s plans for the Iraq war .
After John F. Kennedy bungled the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 , Richard M. Nixon , the former vice president who lost to Mr. Kennedy , visited the new president at the White House and said the nation should support him .
But some conservatives , feeling beleaguered these days , are grateful that Mr. Cheney is speaking out .
John R. Bolton , a former ambassador to the United Nations and a close ally of his , said that after having to hew publicly to Mr. Bush ’s views , Mr. Cheney might be feeling liberated .
“ It ’s about time he had a chance to get his voice back , ” Mr. Bolton said .
“ There ’s no cone of silence now . ”
For its part , the Obama White House is trying to figure out just how to handle the lifting of the cone .
After the former vice president appeared on CNN last month , the White House press secretary , Robert Gibbs , was dismissive , declaring , “ I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy , so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal . ”
But now Mr. Cheney is gaining some traction with his argument that the Obama White House , which prides itself on transparency , should declassify the memorandums he is seeking .
Mr. Gibbs faced a string of questions Thursday about whether Mr. Obama had read them ( he said he did not know ) , and Mr. Axelrod said the White House would consider declassifying them after intelligence and national security agencies had weighed in .
As for Mr. Cheney , he does not have any more interviews scheduled , although his daughter said he was flooded with requests .
Aside from working on his book , he has been meeting with foreign dignitaries , hosting policy luncheons around his kitchen table ( it seats 10 ) and spending a fair amount of time at his other homes , in Wyoming and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland .
He will be making a speech in New York soon , his daughter said , and he has a couple of fishing trips planned for May .

Oregon 's first probable case of swine flu has been detected in a Multnomah county woman and another three specimens under review by the state public health lab could be counted as swine flu cases by the end of the day , officials said this morning .
The woman identified as a probable case was not hospitalized and is now recovering , public health officials said .
Because the woman had been in contact with two members of her extended family who had traveled to Mexico and been exposed to the new strain of virus , officials will treat her case as swine flu pending the results of a confirmatory test by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Dr. Mel Kohn , head of the Oregon Public Health Department .
Results will be available in several days .
The woman identified as a probable case felt flu - like symptoms on Sunday .
She worked one day while ill , officials said , before going to her doctor .
Dr. Gary Oxman , health officer for Multnomah , Clackamas and Washington counties , said none of the woman 's co-workers have so far reported symptoms , but the investigation is ongoing .
The woman tested positive for non-typeable Influenza A. Results from CDC 's confirmatory tests so far show more than 95 percent of cases with this test result will ultimately test positive for swine flu , the state reports .
Within days , Oregon public health expects to receive supplies to conduct its own confirmatory tests .
" I know Oregonians are concerned and want to know what they can do to protect themselves and their families , " Kohn said .
" This does n't change our advice -- wash your hands , cover your cough and if you are sick , stay home . "
In Washington , health officials have identified six probable cases , one of them involving a student at a school that they 've closed for seven days , a step that would be taken in Oregon should swine flu sicken a student or child in day care .
Oxman said the Oregon case does not have any link to schools .
Swine flu is a respiratory disease in pigs that historically has rarely spread to humans .
Humans can be infected with swine flu even if they do n't have physical contact with pigs .
Eating pork or pork products does not transmit the virus .
Symptoms are similar to typical seasonal influenza : fever , lethargy , lack of appetite , coughing , runny nose , sore throat , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran said it had launched a domestically made satellite into orbit for the first time on Tuesday , prompting further concern among Western powers and in Israel over Tehran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Iran said the launch of the Omid ( Hope ) research and telecom satellite was a major step in its space technology timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the U.S. - backed shah .
The long - range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used for launching warheads , although Iran says it has no plans to do so .
“ Dear Iranian nation , your children have placed the first indigenous satellite into orbit , ” President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a televised message , adding the launch was successful .
Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar said Omid was orbiting earth .
The ISNA news agency quoted him as saying : “ We have established communications with it and the necessary information has been received . ”
Sending the Omid into space is a message to the world that Iran is “ very powerful and you have to deal with us in the right way , ” an Iranian political analyst said .
In Washington , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said : “ Efforts to develop missile delivery capability , efforts that continue on an illicit nuclear program , or threats that Iran makes toward Israel and its sponsorship of terror are of acute concern to this administration . ”
Gibbs repeated the words President Barack Obama has used since taking over last month that Washington will “ use all elements of our national power to deal with Iran and to help it be a responsible member of the international community . ”
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States would show openness to Iran -- a change from a hard - line isolation policy under former President George W. Bush -- but urged it to respond in kind .
“ We are reaching out a hand , but the fist has to unclench , ” Clinton told reporters .
Iran has long said its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes .
WORLD POWERS TO MEET
Senior officials from six world powers -- the United States , Russia , Britain , France , Germany and China -- will meet on Wednesday to discuss the nuclear row with Iran .
It is their first meeting since Obama took office .
Speaking after meeting separately with British and French foreign ministers , Clinton said Washington would pursue “ tough and direct ” diplomacy with Tehran and said if Iran did not comply with international demands “ there must be consequences .
Iranian state television showed footage of a rocket blasting off from a launchpad and lighting up the night sky as it streaked into space .
“ With God ’s help and the desire for justice and peace , the official presence of the Islamic Republic was registered in space , ” Ahmadinejad said .
A U.S. security official in Washington said it was unclear what Iran intended to use the satellite for and the United States was still trying to learn more about it .
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told reporters during a visit to Ethiopia the satellite had peaceful aims .

But Andrew Brookes of the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank in London said the news would prompt concern in Israel and elsewhere in the region .
“ They will think that this civilian capability will soon be transformed to a military reconnaissance and intelligence gathering capability , ” he said .
Isaac Ben-Israel , a former head of The Israel Space Agency , told Reuters in Jerusalem : “ If they managed to fire a satellite into space it means they can also reach Western Europe . ”

IRAN UNDER SANCTIONS
Iran is under U.N. and U.S. sanctions because of suspicions about Tehran ’s nuclear plans .
The Islamic state , the world ’s fourth - largest oil producer , says its nuclear work has no military goals but is limited to generating electricity to meet domestic needs .
Ahmadinejad has set tough terms for talks with Obama ’s administration , saying it must change policy not just tactics toward Tehran and apologize for past “ crimes ” against Iran .
Last August , Iran said it had put a dummy satellite into orbit with a domestically made rocket for the first time .
U.S. officials said that launch had ended in failure .
Tal Inbar , head of the Space Research Center at Israeli think tank the Fisher Brothers Institute , said Iran was only the ninth country in the world capable of both producing a satellite and sending it into space from a domestically made launcher .
“ We should regard this satellite as the ‘ Iranian Sputnik ’ , ” he told Israel radio , saying Iran was the first to join this club after Israel in 1988 .
“ The main value is ... propaganda . ”
Western experts say Iran rarely gives enough details for them to determine the extent of its technological advances , and say that Iranian technology largely consists of modifications of equipment supplied by China , North Korea and others .
The television broadcast said the Omid would return to Earth with data after orbiting for one to three months .
Iran already had a satellite in orbit but the Sina - 1 was launched by a Russian rocket in 2005 , said the television .
Since fatuously declaring his to be a “ change ” administration , President Barack Obama has quickly donned the blood - spattered mantle of state secrecy and executive privilege worn by the Bush regime .
On Friday April 3 , the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss one of the Electronic Frontier Foundation ’s ( EFF ) landmark lawsuits against illegal spying by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) .
That suit , Jewell v. NSA , was filed last September against the NSA , NSA Director Keith B. Alexander , President George W. Bush , Vice President Richard Cheney , U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Mike McConnell , Director of National Intelligence .
But with the departure of the Bush gang , the defendants now include President Barack Obama , NSA Director Keith B. Alexander , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Dennis C. Blair , Director of National Intelligence .
When the suit was filed against the government , EFF declared :
The lawsuit , Jewel v. NSA , is aimed at ending the NSA ’s dragnet surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans and holding accountable the government officials who illegally authorized it .
Evidence in the case includes undisputed documents provided by former AT&T telecommunications technician Mark Klein showing AT&T has routed copies of Internet traffic to a secret room in San Francisco controlled by the NSA .
( “ EFF Sues NSA , President Bush and Vice President Cheney to Stop Illegal Surveillance , ” Electronic Frontier Foundation , Press Release , September 18 , 2008 )
Though the drapery in the Oval Office may have changed , the criminal acts against American citizens and legal residents by unaccountable intelligence agencies and privateers in the corporate security industry continue apace .
Based on information disclosed by AT&T whistleblower Klein and other sources , including The New York Times , the suit seeks to “ halt illegal , unconstitutional , and ongoing dragnet surveillance ” by AT&T and other grifting telecoms of the “ communications and communications records ” of their customers .
Klein told the Court in a sworn affidavit that AT&T ’s internet traffic in San Francisco runs through fiber - optic cables at the company ’s Folsom Street facility .
Using a device known as a splitter , a complete copy of internet traffic that AT&T receives–email , web browsing requests and other electronic communications sent by AT&T customers , or received from people who use another internet service provider –was diverted onto a separate fiber - optic cable connected to the company ’s SG - 3 room , controlled by NSA .
Only personnel with NSA clearances–either working for , or on behalf of the agency –have access to this room .
The evidence of corporate malfeasance presented by Klein and other whistleblowers , led the civil liberties ’ watchdog group to assert that AT&T ’s “ deployment of NSA - controlled surveillance capability ” is not limited to the corporation ’s San Francisco facility “ and is consistent with an overall national AT&T deployment to from 15 to 20 similar sites , possibly more .
This implies that a substantial fraction , probably well over half , of AT&T ’s purely domestic traffic was diverted to the NSA .
At the same time , the equipment in the room is well suited to the capture and analysis of large volumes of data for purposes of surveillance . ”
As I reported in November , among the firms supplying the surveillance products hardwired into America ’s telecommunications infrastructure is Verint Systems Inc. ( formerly Comverse InfoSys ) .
The firm was founded by former Israeli intelligence officer , Jacob “ Kobi ” Alexander , a corporate grifter who fled the United States for Namibia after being indicted in 2006 on thirty - two counts of fraud .
Alexander hatched a backdated stock options scheme that netted him $ 138 million in profits looted from company shareholders .
While Alexander and his family may be safely ensconced in the dry but relatively safe harbor of Windhoek , Verint ’s security products live on , providing “ actionable intelligence solutions ” to repressors world wide .
According to a Business Week company profile ,
Verint Systems , Inc. provides analytic software - based solutions for the security and business intelligence markets .
Its analytic solutions collect , retain , and analyze voice , fax , video , email , Internet , and data transmissions from voice , video and IP networks for the purpose of generating actionable intelligence for decision makers .
The company primarily offers communications interception solutions , such as STAR - GATE , RELIANT , and VANTAGE ; networked video solutions that include NEXTIVA ; and contact center actionable intelligence solutions , which include ULTRA .
Verint Systems serves government entities , global corporations , law enforcement agencies , financial institutions , transportation agencies , retail stores , utilities , and communications service providers .
( Verint Systems , Inc. Business Week , Information Technology Sector , accessed April 11 , 2009 )
Other corporate outfits providing similar intelligence “ solutions ” to America ’s telecommunications firms and agencies such as the CIA , FBI , Department of Homeland Security , Defense Intelligence Agency , National Reconnaissance Office and the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency include Verint ’s rival Narus ( another spooky Israeli security firm ) , Siemans and Ericsson .
Despite the economic meltdown , Washington Technology reported March 27 that “ technology companies are poised to tap into the billions of dollars that will flow from the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act into new federal , state and local initiatives . ”
Many of the initiatives include new corporate welfare projects devised by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to “ keep America safe . ”
In this context , the Obama administration ’s drive to preserve the NSA ’s ability to illegally spy on Americans is intimately connected to the corporatist bottom line .
After all , Democrat or Republican , the business of government is business .
Arguments in San Francisco federal district court by U.S. Attorneys have been described by constitutional law experts as being “ worse than Bush . ”
In their motion to dismiss Jewell , the Obama administration cited the same perverse logic of the previous regime : that the state secrets privilege requires the court to dismiss the issue “ out of hand . ”
Douglas Letter , U.S. Terrorism Litigation Counsel for Obama ’s Department of Justice , argued that simply allowing the case to proceed “ would cause exceptionally grave harm to national security . ”
Yet more pernicious–and unprecedented –arguments followed .
“ The DoJ , ” according to EFF , now claim “ that the U.S. Government is completely immune from litigation for illegal spying –that the Government can never be sued for surveillance that violates federal privacy statutes . ”
Arguing that the state possesses “ sovereign immunity , ” the “ change ” administration now claims that under provisions of the disgraceful USA PATRIOT Act–a draconian law rammed through Congress in the wake of the 9/11 attacks –the state is “ immune from suit under the two remaining key federal surveillance laws : the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act . ”
In practice , this means that under a new , ludicrous interpretation of the Orwellian PATRIOT
Act , the government can never be held accountable for illegal surveillance under any federal statute .
As Glenn Greenwald points out in Salon ,
In other words , beyond even the outrageously broad “ state secrets ” privilege invented by the Bush administration and now embraced fully by the Obama administration , the Obama DOJ has now invented a brand new claim of government immunity , one which literally asserts that the U.S. Government is free to intercept all of your communications ( calls , emails and the like ) and –even if what they ’re doing is blatantly illegal and they know it ’s illegal –you are barred from suing them unless they “ willfully disclose ” to the public what they have learned .
( “ New and worse secrecy and immunity claims from the Obama DOJ , ” Salon , April 6 , 2009 )
EFF attorney Kevin Bankston told Salon : “ This is the first time [ the DOJ ] claimed sovereign immunity against Wiretap Act and Stored Communications
Act claims .
In other words , the administration is arguing that the U.S. can never be sued for spying that violates federal surveillance statutes , whether FISA , the Wiretap Act or the SCA . ”
In their motion to dismiss , DoJ attorneys–like their predecessors–argue on Page 13 of the Government ’s brief that “ An assertion of the state secretes privilege “ must be accorded the ‘ utmost deference ’ and the court ’s review of the claim of privilege is narrow . ”
Kasza , 133 F.3d at 1166 ; see also Al - Haramain , 507 F3d at 1203 ( ‘ [ W ]e acknowledge the need to defer to the Executive on matters of foreign policy and national security and surely cannot legitimately find ourselves second guessing the Executive in this arena ’ ) . ”
On Page 16 , the state contends that , “ Finally , all of the plaintiffs ’ claims require the disclosure of whether or not AT&T assisted the Government in alleged intelligence activities , and the DNI again has demonstrated that disclosure of whether the NSA has an intelligence relationship with a particular private company would also cause exceptional harm to national security–among other reasons by revealing to foreign adversaries which channels of communication may or may not be secure . ”
If U.S. District Judge Judge Vaughn Walker rules in the state ’s favor and dismisses Jewell , constitutional protections under the fourth amendment guaranteeing “ the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , ” would be a meaningless charade .
There is however , a precedent for the Obama administration ’s blatant violation of our rights : that of their predecessors in the Bush regime ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
According to an October 23 , 2001 Department of Justice memorandum titled Authority for Use of Military Force To Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States , authored by torture - enabler and OLC head , John C . Yoo , the military could be deployed domestically to interrogate , detain , raid and spy on Americans , without having to comply with constitutional guarantees under the Bill of Rights .
Yoo advised the Oval Office :
Fourth , we turn to the question whether the Fourth Amendment would apply to the use of the military domestically against foreign terrorists .
Although the situation is novel ( at least in the nation ’s recent experience ) , we think that the better view is that the Fourth Amendment would not apply in these circumstances .
Thus , for example , we do not think that a military commander carrying out a raid on a terrorist cell would be required to demonstrate probable cause or to obtain a warrant .
( Page 2 )
Additionally , having decided that the President enjoys plenary , that is , unlimited power to carry out the “ war on terror ” Yoo concludes , after dispensing with Fourth Amendment protections that ,
First Amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully .
…
The current campaign against terrorism may require even broader exercises of federal power domestically .
Terrorists operate within the continental United States itself , and escape detection by concealing themselves within the domestic society and economy .
While , no doubt these terrorists pose a direct military threat to the national security , their methods of infiltration and their surprise attacks on civilian and governmental facilities make it difficult to identify any front line .
Unfortunately , the terrorist attacks of September 11 have created a situation in which the battlefield has occurred , and may occur , at dispersed locations and intervals within the American homeland itself .
As a result , efforts to fight terrorism may require not only the usual wartime regulations of domestic affairs , but also military actions that have normally occurred abroad .
( Pages 24 , 25 )
Indeed , the Bush administration ’s so - called Terrorist Surveillance Program ( TSP ) transformed the United States into a limitless battlespace where anything goes .
From warrantless wiretapping of telephone and internet communications , the seizure of business and medical records , as well as the illegal–and indefinite–detention of citizens and legal residents as “ unlawful enemy combatants , ” Yoo ’s memorandum provided the steel and concrete that gave form to the architectural blueprints for a presidential dictatorship .
Instructively , these memos were not withdrawn until 2008 .
However , in moving to suppress Jewell , Obama ’s Justice Department and their private partners in the telecommunications industry in practice , are continuing the same repressive policies .
As Wired reported back in January , “ NSA whistleblower Russell Tice ” revealed “ that the National Security Agency spied on individual U.S. journalists , entire U.S. news agencies as well as ‘ tens of thousands ’ of other Americans . ”
Tice said on Wednesday that the NSA had vacuumed in all domestic communications of Americans , including , faxes , phone calls and network traffic .
Today
Tice said that the spy agency also combined information from phone wiretaps with data that was mined from credit card and other financial records .
He said information of tens of thousands of U.S. citizens is now in digital databases warehoused at the NSA .
“ This [ information ] could sit there for ten years and then potentially it marries up with something else and ten years from now they get put on a no - fly list and they , of course , wo n’t have a clue why , ” Tice said .
In most cases , the person would have no discernible link to terrorist organizations that would justify the initial data mining or their inclusion in the database .

As George Washington University Law Professor and constitutional scholar , Jonathan Turley , told MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann on “ Countdown ” April 7 ,
I think right now , the Bush people are bringing out their mission - accomplished sign , because they ’ve not only gotten Obama to protect Bush and Cheney and others from any criminal investigation on torture , but he ’s now gone even further than they did in the protection of unlawful surveillance .
This is the ultimate victory for the Bush officials .
They have Barack Obama adopting the same extremist arguments , and in fact exceeding the extremist arguments made by President Bush …
You cannot any longer suggest that President Obama is advancing the civil liberties and the privacy interests that he promised to advance .
This is a terrible roll - back .
It ’s a terrible decision .
( “ Countdown ” with Keith Olbermann , MSNBC , Tuesday , April 7 , 2009 )
And with Congress ’ passage of the abominable FISA Amendments Act ( FAA ) last July , handing the NSA carte blanche to continue warrantless spying and driftnet surveillance of Americans , granting grifting telecom giants such as AT&T , Sprint and Verizon get - out - of - jail - free - cards in the form of retroactive immunity for their collusive and wholly illegal activity with NSA and other state agencies , America ’s post - constitutional new order continues apace .
As I reported last September , “ the extent of these illegal programs have revealed , the ‘ enemy ’ is none other than the American people themselves ! ”
Three months into the Obama administration , the contours of a new and improved “ liberal ” police state reveal the same rotten , nidorous core as that of their predecessors .
This time around however , the mailed fist of the capitalist state is gussied up with Smiley Face emblems and Hello Kitty stickers .
You may be aware of the placebo effect , where an inert pill has an effect because of what the patient thinks it does .
You may even be aware of the nocebo effect , where an inert pill causes ‘ side - effects ’ .
But a fascinating 1970 study reported evidence for the anti-placebo effect , where an inert pill has the opposite effect of what it is expected to do .
Storms and Nisbett were two psychologists interested in attribution , the process of how we explain the causes of events and the impact this has on how we feel .
We know that attributions have a big impact on our level of physical and emotional health .
For example , your heart is racing when you ’re about to give a talk .
If you attribute it to a weak heart , you may start worrying whether you might pass out and become incredibly stressed , but if you attribute it to the situation , you might just think its a natural reaction for the event and feel primed and ready .
In anxiety disorders , we know that people often attribute natural bodily reactions to frightening causes , which makes people feel more on edge , and hence , their body kicks into an even higher gear , and so on .
The cycle continues , to fever pitch .
In essence , it ’s anxiety - fuelled anxiety .
Insomnia has an element of this .
People can be worried that they ’re not sleeping , and so get anxious thoughts when they go to bed , and so feel on edge , ad nocturnum , until the early hours .
So rather than getting people to fill in questionnaires about causes of insomnia , a typical method in attribution research , Storms and Nisbett wanted to test these ideas in the real world .
They recruited a group of patients with insomnia and told them they were doing a four - night study on dreaming and asked them to rate their difficulty in falling asleep each night .
The first two nights were exactly that , a sleeping and rating exercise , but on the third night the participants were given pills .
One group was told that the pill would make them feel more aroused , like a shot of caffeine , while the others were told that the pill would make them feel more relaxed , like a sleeping pill .
On the fourth night , the group were given the ‘ opposite ’ pill , but in reality , all the pills were identical and completely inert , containing nothing more than sugar .
Now here ’s the thing .
The insomnia patients taking the ‘ relaxation ’ pills slept really badly , and the patients taking the ‘ arousal ’ pills slept much better .
What seemed to be happening was that patients taking ‘ uppers ’ , normally trapped in a cycle of anxious self - monitoring , could attribute any arousal they had to the pill .
Any sign of feeling wired was n’t them , it was the pill , so they could relax and fell asleep easily .
In contrast , those who had taken the ‘ downers ’ thought that any arousal must be their insomnia causing them problems , and it must be really bad , because it was getting to them despite the supposed sleeping pill they ’d taken .
In other words , they were freaking out because they could n’t sleep despite the ‘ medication ’ .
It turns out that this simple experiment was n’t easily replicated but the problem was solved in 1983 when it was realised that this effect only held for people with insomnia who obsessively self - monitored .
But what these experiments tell us is that the effects of medication , the symptoms of illness and even the process of ‘ being sick ’ is partly dependent on our own ideas about what ’s happening .

Which of your friends does he most look like ?
I added the question mark to be on the safe side but there ’s really no doubt about it .
Josh Marshall , writing at TPM on Thursday :
More and more the timeline is raising the question of why , if the torture was to prevent terrorist attacks , it seemed to happen mainly during the period when we were looking for what was essentially political information to justify the invasion of Iraq .
And Dowd , today :
More and more the timeline is raising the question of why , if the torture was to prevent terrorist attacks , it seemed to happen mainly during the period when the Bush crowd was looking for what was essentially political information to justify the invasion of Iraq .
This makes twice in the span of four days that a major newspaper ’s been caught cribbing material from nutroots blogs , which stands to reason .
According to a survey of more than 200 journalists recently conducted at BYU , “ despite equal awareness [ of lefty and righty blogs ] , journalists spend more time reading posts in the liberal blogosphere . ”
Contain your surprise .
For example , more journalists know about Michelle Malkin than Talking Points .
Yet twice as many journalists actually read Talking Points than read Michelle Malkin .
“ When journalists take story ideas from blogs , those ideas naturally will come from blogs they read , ” Davis said .
“ These reading patterns suggest journalists may be getting primarily one view of the blogosphere . ”
They ’re taking more than just ideas , champ .
In fact , the beauty of MoDo ’s snafu is that not only does it show a major player in the media being led around by nutroots talking points , it involves her lifting stuff from a blog that ’s actually called “ Talking Points . ” Glorious .
Exit question :
Any predictions as to what her excuse will be ?
I ’m guessing she ’ll say she was copy / pasting material when researching the article and she hit paste in the wrong document and then forgot that she did n’t write that bit and somehow the Times ’s five layers of fact - checking or whatever did n’t recognize the quote — which is surprising , really , given that they ’re all probably TPM readers too .
All theories welcome , though .
Oh , to be a JournoList member tonight !
I posted this clip last week but a fresh viewing might be warranted under the circumstances .
Update : A site about NYT gossip claims to have obtained a statement from Dowd .
It ’s unspeakably lame so I ’m guessing , yeah , it ’s authentic .
josh is right .
I did n’t read his blog last week , and did n’t have any idea he had made that point until you informed me just now .
i was talking to a friend of mine Friday about what I was writing who suggested I make this point , expressing it in a cogent — and I assumed spontaneous — way and I wanted to weave the idea into my column .
but , clearly , my friend must have read josh marshall without mentioning that to me .
we ’re fixing it on the web , to give josh credit , and will include a note , as well as a formal correction tomorrow .
I.e . “ I did n’t mean to rip off Josh Marshall , I meant to rip off my friend . ”
I ’m curious as to how this exchange with her “ friend ” went , precisely .
Presumably they were chatting casually and whoever it was read Marshall ’s quote and she said , “ Great point !
Say that again ! ” and he / she repeated it … verbatim , and slowly while MoDo scribbled it down .
Has that ever happened to you while making chitchat ?
Someone asks you to repeat a point you made and you restate it … word for word ?
Update :
Ah , a more reasonable possibility from the comments :
When she says she was “ talking ” to a friend , she might mean IMing .
The friend could have copy / pasted it without attribution and she thought it was an original idea .
Even so , though , when I want to use something someone ’s said to me in casual conversation , I always frame it as “ As a friend said to me the other day ” or some similar formulation .
The alternative is to ask their permission to treat the idea as your own , but presumably she did n’t do that in this case or else the friend would have said where he got it from .
Guess who ’s coming to dinner .
After months of proclaiming that single payer is off the table , Senator Max Baucus ( D - Montana ) has invited five key single payer advocates to meet with him in Washington , D.C. this week .
On Wednesday June 3 , Senator Baucus will meet with Dr. David Himmelstein , Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program ( PNHP ) , Dr. Marcia Angell , Senior Lecturer , Harvard Medical School and former editor - in - chief of the New England Journal of Medicine , Dr. Oliver Fein , Associate Dean , Cornell Weill Medical School , and President of PNHP , Rose Ann DeMoro , executive director of the California Nurses Association , and Geri Jenkins , president of California Nurses Association .
“ Bowing to mounting pressure from single payer advocates around the nation , Senator Baucus has asked to meet with some representatives of the single payer movement , ” Dr. Himmelstein said .
“ It ’s the thirteen people who braved arrest at Senate Finance Committee hearing , the hundreds of single payer supporters who ’ve shadowed Senator Baucus in his home state of Montana , and the thousands who have put pressure other members of Congress who have created this opening .
We have no illusions that our discussions alone will persuade Senator Baucus to back a single payer bill .
But the meeting is a clear indication that demonstrations and activism can move even our money - corrupted political culture . ”
According to a recent analysis by the public interest group Consumer Watchdog , Senator Baucus , the leading architect of health reform in the Congress , has received more campaign contributions from the health insurance and pharmaceutical corporations than any other current Democratic member of the House or Senate .
According to the report , Senator Baucus received $ 183,750 from health insurance companies and $ 229,020 from drug companies in the last two election cycles .
During three recent Senate Finance Committee hearings on health care reform , Baucus invited 41 people to testify — not one of which was a single payer advocate .
This despite the fact that recent polls show that single payer is supported by a majority of Americans , doctors and health economists .
Baucus has been asked repeatedly in recent months to allow a single payer advocate to testify .
He has steadfastly refused .
“ We ’re keeping our eyes on the prize — enactment of a single payer , everybody in , nobody out , free choice of doctor and hospital health insurance system in the United States , ” said Russell Mokhiber of Single Payer Action .
“ We wo n’t let up until single payer becomes a reality .
And sooner or later single payer will become a reality because it ’s the only system that is financially viable , that will cover all Americans , and that will end the nightmare of 60 Americans dying every day from lack of health insurance . ”
“ Senator Baucus has charged us with ‘ disruption of Congress , ' ” said Mokhiber , who is one of thirteen citizens Baucus had arrested for demanding that single payer advocates be given a seat at the table .
“ But we are charging Baucus with corruption of Congress .
We think we have a stronger case .
And we hope to win the court case , break through the corrupt barriers in Congress and secure single payer for the American people . ”
The next court date for the Baucus 13 is scheduled for June 22 before D.C. Superior Court Judge Harold L. Cushenberry .
Why do so many game companies treat potential customers better than current customers ?
If game companies are only interested in short term gain , of seducing people to buy the game and not seducing them to love the game , is it any surprise that gamers are selling new games left and right ?
After being heavily seduced by a massive hype marketing campaign , the actual customer experience in the game is given little attention .
The truth is that grand hype campaigns are far less effective at making customers then satisfied customers are talking to non-customers .
“ Dude , this game I ’m playing is so awesome .
You ’ve got to try it . ”
That , alone , creates more sales than anything else .
It would be logical to conclude that the more passionate the customer is made about the game , the more that customer ‘ sells ’ the game by recommending it to others .
So why do n’t game companies want me passionate and crazy about their game once I buy it ?
I loathe putting in a new game today .
Most of the time , it is filled with ornate introductions with awful storytelling .
After that , it is half an hour , at least , of tutorials .
This is extremely boring .
Then the game starts , and it goes through the typical boring and dull beginning stages .
Yawn .
Worse , I often have to download constant patches or wait an hour just for the game to install ( and this does n’t happen just on PC .
It happens with PS3 games as well ) .
After a couple of hours of this nonsense , game companies are surprised that a customer will just say , “ Screw this ! ” , turn it off , and sell the game to a used game store ?
Take the marketing teams full of those copywriters and other creative types and instead of having them in the process of before the sale , place them after the sale .
The main reason why sales of Apple products are rising is because of how the customer is treated after the sale ( as compared to a generic PC ) .
Here are some examples of older games that placed a focus on existing users .
Wii -
The sales avalanche of the Wii came not from Wii marketing of commercials , radio spots , and hype .
The avalanche came from current customers sharing their Wii with non-customers .
So this Wii has a motion controller , what type of game should the customer get ?
Nintendo packed in Wii Sports which was a brilliant move .
Wii Sports was the reward to current customers , not potential customers .
Nintendo ’s well known customer service also serves in this regard .
When companies do not make an effort at customer service , they are implying to customers that they are not worth an effort , that customers are not that important to them .
Jewel Boxes -
( Above : Cloth map of an Ultima game .
Can you guess which one ? )
While the jewel box era seems insane to today ’s publishers , the purpose of the jewel box was for current customers .
Like the picture at the top of this post , the early PC game industry began not with glitzy brochures and hype trains with weak manuals but the opposite .
The PC game industry began with putting massive , glorious manuals inside the box .
Today , people say manuals are a waste of time , that manuals are not important .
But manuals are the most important part of that Jewel Box .
They taught the user how to play the game .
Often , they contained story , character information , and other fine illustrations or wit to make them fun and memorable .
So not only did the manual teach the player how to play the game , it taught them to become passionate about the game .
Many people say that any game with an accessory sells because it has an accessory such as Wii Play , Wii Fit , Mario Kart Wii , Guitar Hero , and Rock Band .
In many of these cases , the accessory is lame and irrelevant to the game such as Wii Play ’s extra Wii-mote to Mario Kart Wii ’s wheel .
I suspect these type of boxed products are so popular in part because they are boxed products ; customers feel like they are getting more .
There is a sense of joy opening a box and not knowing what is inside .
The current DVD case is boring since there can only be a disc inside .
In those days , RPG games came with full cloth maps , spell cards , and even little story books even though the RPG was vastly complicated .
But do n’t you think these additional items would make the customer want to LEARN the game , to see what this rich textured game is all about ?
Space shooters , such as Wing Commander , even had mock blueprints of the ships you flew .
The point is that there are more ways than a cinematic introduction , narrative , and rich graphics to get a paid customer to taste the rich texture of the game before he or she has to learn it .
Game companies ought to look at ways to get paid customers to experience the rich texture of the game before the tutorial starts .
( Above : Blueprints included inside the original Wing Commander box .
Lovely stuff ! )
Why the piracy ?
Maybe it has something to do with worshipping potential customers while treating current customers like garbage .
It would be logical for someone to not buy the game , to remain a potential customer , since he is going to be treated better than the paid customer anyway .
( DRM attempts are a good example of paid customers being treated worse than non-paying customers [ piraters ] ) .
In my search about this subject , I ran into this page by Todd Howard , executive producer at Bethsheba .
On it , Mr. Howard talks about the glory of juicy boxes and the cloth map in general .
Take a look .
Spawning -
Warcraft II put Blizzard on the map .
So the question should be , what put Warcraft 2 on the map ?
Aside from being a good game and all , what grand marketing scheme did Blizzard do to push Warcraft 2 ?
None really .
Blizzard was at such a state in those days that if you called them ( which I did , haha ) , you would get an answering machine with an Orc voice on the other end : “ Please leave a message , daboo ! ” )
Warcraft 2 embraced spawning .
This was the process of being able to install Warcraft 2 on multiple machines and have multiple people play off of one disc .
Starcraft embraced spawning as well which certainly helped its success .
All it took was one passionate customer to bring the disc to a LAN party , and you would have a crowd playing it .
A publisher today would likely nix this idea because it would ‘ hurt sales ’ .
After all , the idea of people being able to play full multiplayer off of one disc would meant that many people would never buy the game , they would just play multiplayer off that one disc .
This ended up not being true .
The game spread like wildfire .
Westwood ingeniously sold the first Red Alert with two discs , a Soviet disc and an Allied disc .
The two discs were exactly the same in that they had full single player and full multiplayer capabilities .
The difference was that the Soviet disc had access only to the Soviet single player campaign while the Allied disc had access to only the Allied single player campaign .
Both discs were needed to have two people play multiplayer .
Like Warcraft 2 ’s spawning , this helped Red Alert be played for multiplayer reasons to non-customers as well as a disc being ‘ borrowed ’ to friends to make new converts .
Of course , there is no way a publisher today would allow this .
The latest example of spawning would be with the DS download play .
Many DS games allowed multiplayer gaming off of one cart .
Indeed , my Bomberman game cartridge remains quite popular because of this .
It introduces new people to the game .
Once they play it , learn it , and like it , they often end up buying it .
If they do n’t like it , they do n’t buy it .
” See !
See !
A sale was lost because they could play the game ! ”
It just did n’t fit the customer ’s taste .
What would be worse is hoodwinking the customer with hype to find them buying a game they never played only to hate it .
They not only sell the game , they avoid the game company ’s future offerings .
It is better for long term sales to make gamers first and customers second .
Remember , people became Wii Sports players before they became Wii buyers .
Command and Conquer -
Command and Conquer series , aside from the two discs included in Red Alert , did something else very interesting .
The installation was made into a trippy experience .
Instead of a boring loading bar , which makes the customer starting off bored , the installation was busy immersing the paid customer into the rich texture of the game world .
In other words , before the gamer begun a tutorial or reached the title screen , the gamer was being hammered , left and right , by the rich texture of the game world .
Do n’t you think this would make the new customer anxious to learn and explore this game world ?
Command and Conquer Installer :
Tiberian Sun Installer : ( Note how the sequel specifically evolves from the previous installer ?
Nice touch , Westwood . )
Red Alert Installer :
Aside from the Tibarian Sun one , these installers were done even in DOS .
As video games are interactive , these installers make more impact then even the YouTube video can portray because by doing the ‘ sound test ’ and all , the installer has you feel you are interacting inside the game world … even before the game has been installed !
Publishers like EA , took over the Command and Conquer franchise , thought these ‘ installers ’ are a ‘ waste of resources ’ since they are not part of the ‘ game ’ .
I disagree .
If it is in front of the customer ’s face , it is important .
I ’d rather have a cinematic installer than yet another cinema movie bloated inside the game .
Why ?
Because I * have * to go through the installation process .
You might as well make it fun .
The belief that it is not part of the game is absurd .
Reviewers will pretend the installation process with its boring loading bar does n’t exist .
But the customer will see it … and get bored .
Who hates these long installation processes ?
And how hard is it to not jazz it up a little ?
In a way , the Westwood installer is marketing .
It is marketing and hyping to the paid customer , not to the potential customer .
It is saying , “ Yes , thank you for purchasing this game .
You will not regret it !
Get hyped because this game is going to blow your socks off ! ”
The customer begins the game ‘ warmed ’ with intrigue instead of ‘ cold ’ of boredom from the installation process .
It is easier to get the paid customer passionate when he is warmed up ( providing the game has the weight to deliver which Westwood ’s games did ) .
The result is that by marketing to the paid customer , the paid customer becomes passionate and evangelizes the non-customers .
The early Westwood games had no problems with sales .
It was n’t just that they were good games , they were experiences aimed at paid customers rather than potential customers .
– Nintendo Power
( Above : Oh God , the above brings back memories ! )
It has been said that Nintendo Power was made for only the purpose of selling more NES games to kids .
This is true , in part , but the process is being missed .
Let ’s remember that Sheff ’s “ Game Over ” book had one context for Nintendo : as a manipulative , power - hungry company who was brainwashing the children of America .
The truth is a little different .
( Above : Remember when these games came out ?
Who knew you were living in the midst of classics . )
Nintendo
Power is unlike any other game magazine I ’ve read .
It is a crying shame that no other magazine really did what it did and that Nintendo Power eventually de-evolved to resemble every other gaming magazine .
Nintendo Power was n’t a long ass brochure of games you did n’t own .
It was a long ass manual of games you owned and did n’t own .
Nintendo Power was n’t aimed at potential NES customers .
Nintendo Power was aimed at current NES customers .
Nintendo Power is a perfect example of moving the marketing and copyrighting guys to a post sales point rather than a pre sales point .
( Above : No one makes games like the above anymore … not even Nintendo , alas ! )
NES games are very difficult .
They are hard both to master and to navigate with their elaborate mazes and maps .
No one denies this .
No one denied it then , and no one denies it today .
Often , gamers today look back at these NES games and wonder , “ How in the world did we beat these games ? ”
( Above : How can there be so much awesome on one cover ? )
The answer was Nintendo Power .
Nintendo Power was n’t a commercial - less magazine whose purpose was to be a 90 - page NES commercial .
Nintendo Power was a monthly NES manual , all in color , complete with maps , tips , and secret codes .
As a tool , it was favorable for customers to collect and not throw away Nintendo Power magazines ( i.e. old issues did not lose value over time ) .
Nintendo Power was based off of the Japanese design where the graphics and layout was made first with the text being added later .
This helped give the magazine such a graphic feel .
While it was said to be expensive to make , while it was said to be a waste of time since kids do n’t care to read ( where have we heard this before ? ) , Arakawa ( President of NOA ) went ahead with it .
The result was that the magazine became the best selling kid ’s magazine in the United States .
( Above : Note the 16 - page Tetris Tip book which was a cartoon .
Nintendo sold Tetris by teaching people about it .
I like the ‘ Do n’t Miss ! ’ list .
All three of those games were not worth missing !
This is why I find the ‘ NP as brainwash advertising ’ argument so thin .
The games the magazine decided to push are today ’s classics .
I ca n’t recall NP , in its early time , pushing a bad game . )
It is quite a wonder to look at old issues of Nintendo Power .
Entire stages of maps were placed inside the magazine complete with information on power - ups and all .
Basically , a feature on a game ended up being a rich manual that taught people how to play the game .
While the common line is that Nintendo Power was a commercial to sell games to kids , what is n’t mentioned is that this was done by teaching them .
No game was presented because it was ‘ hardcore ’ or ‘ elite ’ or any other technique marketers use today ( except for the second issue with Simon holding Dracula ’s head .
THAT was cool ! ) .
Each and every game was presented by teaching how it plays .
( Above : Parents were concerned that the second issue of Nintendo Power had Simon holding a decapitated Dracula head .
After complaints , Nintendo
Power put out no more cool covers like the above . )
One of the great lessons is that once people , kids or whoever , learned how to play the game , only then could they become passionate about it .
The worst thing to do is hand someone a game , watch them fail , and they put the game down and never want to play it again .
In other words , marketing should be moved to TEACHING and away from empty hype .
Consider that the pre-Nintendo Power of the Nintendo Fun Letter released a full blown overworld map of Legend of Zelda .
Now , Legend of Zelda is a very difficult game to a newcomer .
That overworld map helped owners of the game to beat it ( which made them more passionate about it ) .
However , it also got potential customers looking at the map to understand and grasp what the game was about .
They would then feel confident enough to purchase it .
( Above :
The maps and information is not only desired by people who own the game .
They make potential customers want to PLAY this game ! )
( Above : “ Uncle Malstrom , why is Metroid 1 so hard ? ”
It is because , children , you do not have snazzy maps like in this issue of Nintendo Power ! )
( Above : Even the ‘ comics ’ attempted to teach . )
( Above : Nintendo Power would decline as it tried to become more like a ‘ normal ’ magazine .
But it still ‘ taught ’ as seen above even a little . )
Many say that Gamefaqs and various walkthroughs online have eliminated the need for magazines like Nintendo Power .
But Gamefaqs is n’t so interested in teaching gamers as it is for the contributor to strut himself / herself .
Who wants to read a gigantic block of text ?
I think Nintendo erred by believing game specific players ’ guides should be sold separately as if people wanted the game secrets and would pay for them .
If given the choice of paying for secrets to getting them free off the Internet , the Internet wins all the time .
Nintendo erred in not figuring out that potential customers were drawn to the ‘ game secrets ’ to learn about the game .
Potential customers certainly are not going to pay $ 15 for a book just to learn about a game they may or may not purchase .
Some game companies have realized it is important to TEACH current customers about the game .
Blizzard , I know , employs some people to do nothing but create an online strategy guide in better teaching how to play their games .
With the Starcraft 2 Battlefield Reports ( and this is before Starcraft 2 beta has even come out ) , it is clear that the Blizzard people are trying to TEACH onlookers about how the game works as opposed to showering them with more cinematic trailers which tell us nothing about the game ( aside from the game ’s announcement , there has been very little in terms of cinematic trailers ) .
( Starcraft 2 ’s Battle Reports are little more than Blizzard teaching and explaining the game . )
-MMORPGs
Why is World of Warcraft and other MMORPGs so popular ?
Well , one of the reasons is that current customers are treated well , very well !
The focus of the MMORPG is for the current customer ( which is entirely different from other games where they focus on potential customers ) .
This keeps the customer playing and generating cashflow .
The MMORPGs that spend their energy chasing potential customers , instead of servicing current customers , are those that end up shutting down .
Conclusion
The passionate customer is the best salesman .
A game company , or any company , would want their customers to be as happy and as passionate as possible because it will spur interest from onlookers .
“ Why is it about Y game that causes him to play 10 hours a day ? ” “ Why do they keep talking about X game ?
I should look into it . ”
When a game has a high sold - to - used - store rate , it almost always occurs that the game company was treating potential customers better than current customers .
There was enormous energy in hyping the game , in saying how the game would revolutionize everything , and it might make a sale but it does n’t make a player of that game .
I think focusing on making players , through teaching , through creating interest in playing and mastering the game ( as hints and strategies seem to do ) , do far better than hammering out hype .

How much electricity do household items use ?
Last update : June 2013
The calculator at right will give you a rough idea of how much electricity something uses and how much it costs you .
But there are some important caveats :
Electricity rates vary widely .
I 've found rates from 12 ¢ to 50 ¢ per kWh from the same provider .
If you want results that are anywhere close to accurate , you 'll need to check your own electric bill and find your actual kWh rate .
Your bill might have multiple kWh rates ( e.g. , one for " delivery " and one for " fuel " ) , and in that case you should to add up them all up to get the total kWh rate .
Most rates are tiered , meaning the higher your use , the higher the rate .
You should generally enter your highest tier into the calculator , because any energy you save will save you money at that highest tiered rate .
Electrical use varies from model to model .
I thought this would be obvious , but in hundreds of blogs and forums people say things like , " Mr. Electricity says a computer uses 150 watts , " which is a mischaracterization .
The calculator and table figures are just examples .
( See how to misquote this website . )
Some devices use varying amounts of electricity .
An easy example is an oven , whose energy use depends on how high you crank it .
Perhaps a less obvious example is a washing machine , which effectively uses phenomenally more energy if you wash in hot rather than cold .
Then there 's the refrigerator , which alternates between periods of full energy use while the compressor is running , and then next to nothing when the compressor shuts off .
( To solve this problem for fridges , the calculator lists the average wattage over time , not the higher amount used when the compressor runs . )
Most devices do n't run 24/ 7 .
Therefore the " Hours per Day " and " Days per Month " fields in the calculator are crucial .
Even so , you might not have a good idea about how various appliances run .
So below we 'll discuss which items use the most energy in a typical home .
You can also measure a device 's usage yourself , which gives you the best information for your own situation .

Wattage varies from model to model !
Figures above are examples .
See How to Misquote this Website .
Data for specific models of appliances is available at the Power Consumption Database .
Some devices use a little energy even when they 're not on .
This is called standby power , or vampire power .
In most cases it 's negligible , the main exception being cable TV boxes .
My standby power page has more info on this .

Electrical usage of household items
At the bottom of this page is a chart showing the relative use of various appliances .
( DoE ) Note that this does n't really jibe with the pie chart above from the DoE .
( Refrigerators and appliances use different amounts in the different charts . )
If I can ever find the time , I 'll try to make my own chart .
Here are some other websites that give sample costs for various household items considering how much those items are used :
Individual Appliances
At far right is a table listing examples of the wattage of common household appliances .
Appliances that create or remove heat use the most electricity .
In the table at right , appliances that make things hot are listed in red and ones that make things cold are listed in blue .
As you can see , together they dwarf everything else on the list .

Here 's another table from Generator Sales .
A database which lists power data for specific models of products is Power Consumption Database .
Remember that electrical usage varies from model to model , and that the tables on this site are just examples .
( See how to misinterpret this website . )
Figuring the use of your own items
If the label gives only the number of amps and not the number of watts , then just multiply the amps by 120 to get the number of watts .
( Amps x Volts = Watts , and most U.S. electricity is ~ 120 volts .
So a hot plate rated at 6 amps uses 6 x 120 = 720 watts , on the highest setting .
Most other countries use 240 volts instead of 120 , so outside of North America and Japan use 240 instead of 120 in your calculations . )
Note that if a device is powered by a transformer ( one of those great big plugs ) , then the transformer has converted the electricity from AC to DC , so you need to multiply by the DC voltage , not the AC voltage of 120 .
For example , if the device says " INPUT 9V , 0.5A " , then that 's 9 volts x 0.5 amps = 4.5 watts .
You may have noticed that appliances may be labeled 110 , 115 , or 120 volts .
U.S. appliances are actually designed to accept a range of voltages , between 110 - 120 volts , and the exact voltage coming out of your electrical socket can vary depending on conditions at the power plant and in your own home .
Let 's just agree that when we say 120 volts , we understand that it 's actually a range from 110 - 120 .
And just use 120 for your calculations ( unless you 're outside of North America or Japan , in which case you probably have 220 - 240 volts ) .
Your device might actually list a huge voltage range , like 100 - 240V .
That just means that it will work with any country 's voltage .
For your calculations , use the voltage for the country where you 're plugging the device in .
Some important caveats :
The amount of electricity listed on the label is the maximum amount that the appliance will ever use .
For example , a 300 - watt refrigerator will only run at 300 watts when the compressor 's running ( which is when it makes that humming sound , indicating that it 's actually chilling the air inside ) .
Most of the time the fridge just sits there , using only 5 watts or so for its electronics .
If the amount of work done by a device varies up and down , then so does its energy use .
( e.g. , a stereo that can be turned up or down , an oven that can be set at various temperatures , a fridge that sometimes runs and sometimes does n't , a computer that sometimes spins its various drives and sometimes has to use more of its brainpower , etc . )
The label on computers is particularly useless ; a computer labeled at 300 watts probably uses only about 100 .
( More on computers ' electrical use . )
In just a bit we 'll cover how to measure the actual amount of electricity being used by a device
Many consumer items are advertised according to their power output , not input .
That means the stereo that says 30 watts on the box might actually require 50 watts to make 30 watts of sound ( assuming the volume was cranked ) , and your 900 - watt microwave oven might actually use 1400 watts ( on its highest setting ) .
That 's because all electrical devices are inefficient -- they have to use some extra energy to do what they do .
Some devices use energy even when they 're not on .
( Standby power )
Exercise : Pretend there 's an energy crisis and they start rationing electricity .
You 're given a bonus of 1000 watt - hours of electricity to use because you won a special drawing .
If you 're choosing between using your stereo or your central air conditioner , how long could you run each ?
Assume that your stereo uses 30 watts and your AC uses 3500 watts .
( see answer )
1000 Wh will run a 30 - watt stereo for 1000 / 30 = 33 hours .
1000 Wh will run a 3500 - watt AC for 1000 / 3500 = 0.29 hours ( 17 minutes ) .
Exercise :
The power adapter on your laptop computer says its output is 24V and 1.875 amps .
The input specs are n't listed for some reason .
What 's the maximum number of watts your computer could ever use ?
( see answer ) 24V x 1.875a = 45 watts
Your adapter could draw a little more than this , because it 's a little inefficient at converting the 120V to 24V , but that does n't really matter because your computer will rarely need the full 45 watts anyway ( which would require all the drives to be spinning and the processor to be fully busy ) .
Energy - saving strategies
Here 's how much various strategies can save you .
The Atlantic cod has , for many centuries , sustained major fisheries on both sides of the Atlantic .
However , the North American fisheries have now largely collapsed .
A new article from scientists at the University of Iceland and Marine Research Institute in Reykjavik provides insights into possible mechanisms of the collapse of fisheries , due to fisheries - induced evolution .
Cod fishing is of highest intensity in shallow water in Iceland and it selects against genotypes of cod adapted to shallow water .
The new PLoS
One article reports a significant difference in Darwinian fitness ( relative survival rate ) between shallow - water and deep - water adapted cod .
The shallow - water fish have only 8 % of the fitness of deep - water fish .
This difference can lead to rapid elimination of shallow - water fish in only a few generations with drastic effects on the population and the fishery .
Using molecular population genetics , the authors reports steep changes in the frequency of genotypes at a single genetic locus with depth : a gradient of nearly one half percent drop in frequency per meter .
The genotypes at the locus are directly related to behavioral types that select deep vs shallow water habitat by genotype .
" There is no direct targeting of specific genotypes .
Instead the intense selection results from the interaction of fish that select their habitat by genotype and fishermen choosing to fish in the preferred habitat of the fish , " said Einar Arnason , professor of population genetics and lead author .
In addition to the molecular results , the study also demonstrates that the length and age at which the fish become mature have decreased .
So - called " probabilistic maturation reaction norms " show that the length at which there is a 50 % probability of becoming mature , has , on average , decreased nearly one centimeter per year .
The changes observed very likely are evolutionary genetic changes and not simply plastic phenotypic responses to the environment .
They are comparable to changes that preceded the collapse of northern cod at Newfoundland .
This finding further supports the hypothesis of an imminent collapse of Icelandic cod due to the intense fisheries - induced selection .
The cod fishery at Iceland is one of the world 's few remaining cod fisheries .
The study appears to have met all criteria for concern that this fishery is threatened .
" Can anything be done to avert collapse ? " the authors ask .
A strategy that would remove selection pressures against shallow - water adapted fish would seem to be the answer .
The authors speculate that immediate establishment of large no - take reserves might be the right strategy by relieving selection pressures on all genotypes .
The findings provide general lessons for population and conservation genetics that anthropogenic changes in habitat can lead to intense selection even if the mortality is non-selective in the habitat in which it occurs .
The study highlights the importance of applying Darwinian principles and evolutionary thinking to fisheries and conservation science .
The study was funded by grants from the Icelandic Research Fund and resources from the Marine Research Institute and the University of Iceland .
Specimens were obtained during Marine Research Institute Surveys .
The funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .

Best Buy may be forced to change its price matching policy , or at least be more transparent about its practices .
A lawsuit against the company alleging false advertising and deceptive practices has been approved as a class action by a US District Court in New York , giving the plaintiffs more steam in their fight against the big box retailer .
Even more interesting , however , is that the process of approving the suit has exposed some of Best Buy 's dirty laundry .
The original lawsuit was brought by New York resident Thomas Jermyn in January of 2008 and was granted class action status as of last week .
In his suit , Jermyn targets Best Buy's " price match guarantee " as a ploy to lure unsuspecting customers into the stores while actively practicing an " Anti- Price Matching Policy " among managers and employees .
Savvy deal hunters in the audience are already aware that trying to get a real price match on something at Best Buy can be an exercise in futility .
It 's not uncommon to hear anecdotal grumblings that Best Buy will find every excuse to not adhere to its publicly - advertised policy — the store is out of ( or low on ) stock , Best Buy does n't match Internet prices , model numbers do n't match up , etc .
However , according to court documents , these instances apparently are n't just a result of clueless retail drones — it appears Best Buy actively encourages employees to use these very excuses to avoid offering the customer a good deal .
" What is the first thing we do when a customer comes in to our humble box brandishing a competitor ’s ad asking for a price match ?
We attempt to build a case against the price match , " reads an internal company memo from October of 2006 , which is quoted in the court documents .
" Let 's walk through the ' Refused Price Match Greatest Hits : '
Not same model ?
Not in stock at the competitor ?
Do we have free widget with purchase ?
Is it from a warehouse club ( they have membership fees , you know ) ?
Limited Quantities ?
That competitor is across town ?
We ’ve got financing !
Is it an internet price ?
It ’s below cost !
What about my NOP ? "
Best Buy 's defense for the existence of this document is that its author is a " long - standing employee with a sense of humor . "
Further evidence provided in the complaint belies that claim .
Numerous Best Buy customers are cited as saying the retailer refused their requests on multiple occasions , or in cases where they already purchased the item , Best Buy told them to return it and pay a hefty restocking fee if they wanted to buy from a competitor with a lower price .
This , of course , defeats the entire purpose of trying to get a price match in the first place .
Additionally , none of these technicalities are mentioned in the public - facing version of Best Buy 's policy .
" If you are about to make a purchase and discover a lower advertised price offered by a local retail competitor on the same available brand and model , let us know and we 'll match that price on the spot , " reads Best Buy 's website .
" Already bought ?
We 'll refund you the price difference from our own sale price , or 110 % of the difference from our competitor 's sale price , during the return and exchange period on your product . "
Questions on that page , such as " What is considered a local retail competitor ? " come with ambiguous answers that seem to contradict the internal memo encouraging employees to deny matches on the basis that the competitor is " across town . "
At best , the retailer is extremely confused about the meaning of its own price match guarantee and has no idea how to treat customers .
At worst ?
We leave that as an exercise to the reader .
Either way , the end result is a group of buyers who are done feeling jerked around and want to make Best Buy pay for it .
HD Guru , which has been following the story closely , spoke with the attorney representing Jermyn , Michael Braunstein , who said that readers who have been refused a price match should contact him by e-mail or phone ( mbraunstein@kgglaw.com or 845-356-2570 ) .
Though this particular lawsuit is limited to New York residents , those outside of New York are encouraged to voice their concerns as well .

CANNABIS CULTURE –
Though science has much left to explore , evidence suggests cannabis can be a powerful medication in treating psychiatric , behavioral and emotional disorders .
It was with skepticism that I first heard of marijuana having psychiatric applications , other than the purely recreational .
My boyfriend at the time had an unpredictable , explosive temper , and was convinced a severe head injury in his youth had rendered his brain forever altered , which he remedied by smoking copious amounts of weed .
Before long , it was evident to me that he was simply a different person when he smoked ; witty and hospitable , rather than anxious and manipulative .
Gone was the violent anger and in its place was , for a lack of a better word – normalcy .
Little did I know that I was witnessing but the tip of the psychiatric iceberg of marijuana ’s potential for the mind .
The questions it raised for me then still stand today , and are characteristic of what we know ( or more accurately , do n’t know ) about both psychiatry and marijuana : how exactly does it work on the brain ?
Can it treat physical or neurological brain damage , or was it , in the case of my ex , easing the symptoms of an underlying emotional problem ?
Or was it something else entirely ?
Throughout history , the study of cannabis has proved to be an elusive and experimental practice , and its illegality has only hindered the process more .
With the isolation of cannabinoids , the active compounds in marijuana and the discovery of the body ’s own corresponding endocannabinoid system in the early 90’s , many strides have been made – most notably in the medical arena .
Even marijuana virgins have heard reference to its application for cancer , glaucoma , multiple sclerosis and an endless list of physical ailments .
Unfortunately , when it comes to the brain and the use of cannabis in treating psychiatric , behavioral and emotional disorders , much of the research by and large simply is n’t there – not for a lack of evidence , but because it has n’t been conducted on any large scale other than in clinical studies .
Dr. Lester Grinspoon , Associate Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at Harvard University Medical School , is an icon in the field of marijuana research .
As the result of a long and distinguished career , Grinspoon has a wealth of clinical anecdotes , although this gives his colleagues reason to admonish him .
“ Everybody [ says ]
‘ Well , that ’s just anecdotal evidence , Grinspoon !
You do n’t have a double - blind controlled study , ’ ” mimics Grinspoon with a laugh .
“ Well , we can ’t !
It ’s illegal material .
But what we do have is a lot of clinical descriptions that did n’t just appear after the advent of the double - blind study in the mid-60’s .
Look at all that we knew before then , about Crohn ’s disease , or about migraines – about all the many things we knew about marijuana , that came before double - blind studies .
And people are still discovering the ways in which marijuana is useful clinically . ”
“ Any symptom or syndrome I would recommend marijuana for – ” continues Grinspoon , “ let ’s say you come in with Crohn ’s disease .
I ca n’t say it would absolutely help you , but I can say to you that there is a quite reasonable probability that it will be helpful to you based on my clinical experience , which is all anecdotal . ”
I ask him about Tourette ’s Syndrome , a particularly intriguing neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by physical and vocal tics .
“ Well , I think it ’s quite miraculous for these folks .
I had a patient who came up here from some southern state because I had n’t listed [ Tourette ’s Syndrome ] in the first edition of my book because I had n’t heard of it , ” remembers Grinspoon , “ and to overcome my skepticism , this delightful young man came up to Harvard to come into my office .
We took a bit of a chance , at Harvard , ” he chuckles , in reference to the man ’s lighting up a joint in his office .
“ He had a few puffs of a joint , and I saw him kicking , there , he had a bad tic .
And within a matter of seconds he stopped kicking completely , he talked smoothly … it was a dramatic demonstration . ”
One of the smaller studies , conducted in Germany by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Cannabis als Medizin ( Association for Cannabis as Medicine ) , alludes to the success Grinspoon witnessed , citing an 85 % efficacy rate in the Tourette ’s patients they surveyed .
Grinspoon oversees two websites that boast hundreds of patient accounts , many of which reference the psychiatric use of marijuana , not just for neurological but also behavioral and emotional disorders .
Grinspoon is the first to admit the shortcomings of the anecdotal method , saying , “ tell me about the people who have tried it and do n’t get relief – they do n’t write and say , ‘ hey I tried it and it ’s not good for me ’. ”
However , the medical hurdles some people are forced to face are no small feat , and when they are adamant that marijuana that has helped them when all other medications have failed , their stories take on even more significance .
In the treatment of behavioral disorders , there is no story more compelling than that of Debbie Jeffries , whose son Jeffrey began to display disturbing symptoms of Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) and unusual temper tantrums at only nine months old .
“ If his bottle did n’t look right to him , if he did n’t get the exact amount of food that he wanted , or if the food on his plate was n’t placed where he wanted it , or the colour combinations were n’t right , if his shoes were n’t tied correctly , the loops were n’t the right size , he had horrific anger fits , ” recalls Debbie .
By the time Jeffrey was three years old he had been in and out of multiple daycare a centers for fighting and misbehaving , and it was gently suggested to Debbie that she look into medicating Jeffrey .
“ I was like , wow … okay , I know he ’s a handful but … ” she recalls .
“ I did n’t know anything about medicine for any type of mental illness or whatever it was going on with him .
But my goal was , ‘ if I can make this child happy , I will do whatever it takes ’ .
And that is how it ’s been even since before he was born .
I will do anything to make sure he has life . ”
Jeffrey was diagnosed with a range of disorders from ADHD to anxiety , which his doctor suggested medicating with Ritalin .
When that proved ineffective , he was launched on an ever - shifting merry - go - round of pharmaceutical drugs , many prescribed to simply counteract the side effects of the original medications .
“ It was like , is this ever going to end ? ” sighs Debbie .
“ Is this ever going to help him ? ” Jeffrey ’s problems , rather than ceasing , simply worsened .
“ At one point he was in a daycare and he threw a desk at a teacher – when he was four years old – because he was mad at her .
He hit her in the face with a shovel … he would fight with kids all the time , ”
Debbie remembers calmly , adding that she woke up one morning to find her son strangling her .
Finally , with every possible drug option exhausted , the doctors decided to admit five - year - old Jeffrey into the first of what became several psychiatric hospitals , but his deterioration continued .
A new state - of - the - art facility for the study of autism called the M.I.N.D. Institute at UC Davis asked Debbie to bring Jeffrey in for neurological testing .
On their second visit , Jeffrey became so agitated that he threw a chair at the researcher when he entered the room .
“ And they dismissed us from the study ! ” exclaims Debbie incredulously .
“ I felt like we were being given up on . ”
By seven years old , Jeffrey was in a residential home that offered one - on - one support , and was on suicide watch because of his harsh medications .
The situation was getting desperate , and Debbie and Jeffrey were at the end of their ropes , figuratively and literally : Jeffrey had been found in his room with a sheet tied around his neck .
Child Protective Services gave Debbie an ultimatum : find a cure for him in thirty days or we will institutionalize him forever .
Debbie was working at a local high school with high - risk teenagers who had ADHD and other behavioral disorders when one day , a group of her students were engaged in a debate about marijuana .
In assisting them , Debbie noticed the Physician ’s Desk Reference they were using mentioned that marijuana had psychiatric uses .
A conservative Christian , Debbie was unfamiliar with the substance .
“ I did n’t know what it smelled like , what it looked like , ” she says with a laugh .
“ I never knew anyone who smoked it growing up .
I guess I was sheltered . ”
With time running out , and despite the intense skepticism of her parents , who had incidentally voted against the legalization of medical marijuana , Debbie began intensive research .
She ended up finding a local organization called the Wo / Men ’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana ( WAMM ) , where director Valerie Corral agreed to look into her case .
Corral asked for all the relevant information available on Jeffrey , and the resident doctor working with WAMM promptly returned Debbie ’s call .
“ Dr. Mike called me , and the first words out of his mouth were , ‘ are you for real ? ’
I said , ‘ excuse me ? ’ and he said , ‘ You ’ve got to be kidding me .
You ’ve got all of these records for this child , and at this age , to have all these behavioral problems ? ’
And I said , ‘ I ’m so real , and it hurts so bad .
I need help .
Can you help me ? ”
The clock was ticking : they had eleven days left .
Debbie says Dr. Mike told her , ‘ I do n’t know if it will help .
However , I know it wo n’t hurt him if we try . ’
Under the careful watch of Dr. Mike and WAMM , Debbie began Jeffrey on an initial dosage of one - quarter of a marijuana brownie .
Debbie departed for school that day in the usual manner – with one hand on the wheel and the other hand holding Jeffrey ’s in the front seat so he could n’t hit her while she was driving .
“ Suddenly his grip loosened , ” says Debbie .
“ I looked over at him and he had a smile on his face .
I said , ‘ are you okay ? ’ and he said , ‘ Mom , my head ’s not so noisy .
I feel happy ’.
From that moment on , he was a different child .
He was n’t angry anymore . ”
The change in Jeffrey ’s behavior stunned his community .
“ They said he had a fantastic day , the first day he had not been in the quiet room for fighting .
They said , ‘ whatever you did , do it again . ’ ”
As word spread , Debbie hid nothing as to the source of Jeffrey ’s miraculous transformation .
“ All the social workers who were involved with him , even before I started it on him , I told them what I was going to do , because I wanted to be up - front .
There ’s something wrong if you have to hide something . ”
Although the support around Debbie and Jeffrey grew to include their local pastor and church members , not everyone was on - side , miraculous cure or not .
Debbie decided to take Jeffrey off his pharmaceutical medications to avoid any interactions , and when letters and visits produced no advice from Jeffrey ’s psychiatrist as to how to do it safely , Debbie found the information she needed from the local pharmacy .
Six weeks later Debbie was informed that the County Child Protective Services were taking her to court for giving her son marijuana : Jeffrey ’s psychiatrist had turned them in .
Medical marijuana had been legal in the state of California since 1996 , however the law concerning its use in children was unclear .
After a six - month court battle , in December of 2001 Debbie won the right to continue giving Jeffrey his medicine in a landmark ruling .
With the first of many battles behind them , Jeffrey began to rediscover the world around him and celebrated his eighth birthday with a party in the company of friends for the first time .
However the peace was shattered on an early September morning in 2002 when the Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) raided the WAMM premises and garden with chainsaws and hauled away the medicine used not only for Jeffrey , but hundreds of other patients suffering from chronic pain and terminal illnesses .
Jeffrey ’s medicine had been derived from four strains of marijuana in which both the flowers and leaf had been painstakingly blended together over a trial of weeks .
Left with limited supplies , Corral was unable to reproduce Jeffrey ’s exact blend of medicine , until the following year .
By that time it was too late , and he spiraled back into the world of violence and anger that for so long had been but a memory .
Jeffrey was eventually sent to a ranch for troubled youth in Utah , where he remains today .
One of the mysteries of Jeffrey ’s story is why , when he could access marijuana once again , it failed to work in the same way , which alludes to the bigger question of what its therapeutic effect on the brain is in general .
Valerie Corral , the co-founder of WAMM who came to Debbie and Jeffrey ’s aid , has used marijuana for 34 years to alleviate the epilepsy she has as a result of a severe car accident .
Suffering from up to five grand mal seizures a day , Corral managed to control them by carefully shifting from a pharmaceutical regimen onto medical marijuana .
“ Having had neurological problems , it allowed me an insight into the complexity of such disorders .
In Jeffrey ’s case I puzzled over the exact ratio of leaf to flower .
I eventually came upon the particular blend that worked for Jeffrey that we call Neuro - Leaf , ” explains Corral , “ which is a balanced mix of one part bud , or the bud shake which would be high in crystal content , to two parts leaf .
A significant element rests in the cooking process , which is prolonged and extremely sensitive – one must avoid high temperatures .
Jeffrey ’s Grandmother LaRayne devised a method that fit the family ’s trying schedule and demands .
I use it so much with children now – children with cancer , and seizure activity .
It repeatedly produces an efficient neurological effectiveness . ”
This particular blend is Corral ’s first choice when it comes to treating psychological disorders , and the fact that the different marijuana strains had been selected and combined for their neurological effects is perhaps what made it so effective for Jeffrey , and why when WAMM was raided the recipe simply could n’t be duplicated fast enough .
“ There are two different basic types [ of Neuro - Leaf ] , ” explains Corral , “ one is an indica base , made from both the flowers and the leaf of cannabis indica and the other is the same derived from cannabis sativa .
But , I found that interspersing a blend of both varieties from time to time assists in maintaining a dependency that can lead to the need to increase dosage .
I find that when this is systematically repeated , the effect is to interrupt the neurological imbalance that leads to , as in Jeffrey ’s case , fits of anger and violent outbursts . ”
As an epileptic , Corral says that on a neurological level , marijuana is “ kind of like a circuit breaker .
When you have a seizure , it feels like an electrical overload , as though there is a short circuit and you go into electrical overload .
That may sound simplistic , but when I use marijuana , in that instance , it appears to steady the electrical imbalance , which creates a pathway that leads away from the aura and eventual seizure to create a state of calm . ”
In the field of Attention Deficit Disorder ( ADD or ADHD ) , marijuana is also creating both waves and unexpected states of calm .
It is beginning to emerge that , much like epilepsy , marijuana may have a calming effect on the brain – without any of the unwanted side effects commonly seen in pharmaceutical options such as Ritalin .
Dr. Claudia Jensen , a pediatrician for 23 years , advocates the use of marijuana for ADD , and has found clinical success in its use particularly in patients for whom – like Jeffrey – all else failed .
Dr. Jay R Cavanaugh is another medical professional associated with the American Alliance for Medical Marijuana who in 2002 wrote a passionate defense of parents who were successfully using medical marijuana for ODD , OCD , Autism , ADHD , Tourette ’s and Bi-polar disorder in their kids .
He states that although the cause of childhood brain disorders is still unknown , it “ seems to involve the way in which brain cells ( neurons ) communicate with one another . ”
Cavanaugh wrote that endocannabinoids within the human body “ are active in the brain and play a vital role in regulating brain function , ” and that they may be “ the most important chemicals of all in establishing and maintaining homeostasis or balance in key brain systems and other systems elsewhere in the body . ”
Debbie agrees that the problem with Jeffrey may have resided within his endocannabinoid system .
“ It was a cannabinoid deficiency , ” offers Debbie , “ and the cannabinoids in the marijuana , that ’s what helped him .
It ’s not the THC but the cannabinoids that helped him – at least that ’s the theory . ”
With so much potential for relief within the field of psychiatric disorders alone , it begs the question : why exactly are there so few studies that have been conducted on the use of marijuana in this field .
Illegality , as stated by Grinspoon earlier , is certainly an issue in many countries , but there are other hurdles that stand in the way of discovering marijuana ’s full psychiatric potential .
Pharmaceutical companies fund the lion ’s share of research , and in order to make a return on all the dollars they invest , they need to patent what they discover .
“ They ca n’t put a patent on it because it ’s a natural herb , ” says Dr. Bruce Levine , a clinical psychologist and author of Surviving America ’s Depression Epidemic : How to Find Morale , Energy and Community in a World Gone Crazy .
“ What they did with cocaine was that they made a synthetic version of it – that ’s what amphetamines are , they ’re just synthetic versions of cocaine – and then once they made a synthetic version of it , you tweak a little chemical here and there and come up with Dexatrin , Ritalin , or Dextro - methamphetamines .
Then you can patent these things . ”
Levine believes that if there were a double - blind study that compared marijuana to psychiatric drugs , the marijuana would far outperform it – not least because psychiatric drugs perform at a level that is often virtually indistinguishable from placebos .
He cites the case of football player Ricky Williams , who was removed as British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline ’s spokesperson after stating that marijuana was ‘ ten times better ’ than their drug Paxil for his social anxiety .
“ The question is , why any of these psychotropic drugs – these drugs that effect neurotransmitters , mood - altering drugs – why they become psychiatric drugs , ” asks Levine .
“ It ’s more economic and political than scientific .
It has a lot to do with whether something can be patented . [… ]
Whether any of these things , that affect cognitive function or your emotionality , whether they become psychiatric drugs is all politics and economics , it ’s nothing to do with science . ”
Marijuana ’s subtle complexity as a plant and psychoactive substance has still only been but touched upon , and there the mystery remains – not only as to how exactly marijuana works psychologically , but the politics surrounding its legislation as well .
When compared with the side effect - riddled pharmaceutical options , with the accompanying risks of organ damage and addiction , marijuana is at the very least a viable alternative – especially for children .
I ’ll admit that initially , I was slightly scandalized at the thought of a child munching down a marijuana muffin on his way to school .
But it is hypocritical to claim that popping a couple Ritalin with the morning OJ is any better , even if it does have the added comfort of legal and social acceptance .
At the end of the day , if safer medication in the form of marijuana is what people want , then it will have to come from the people .
“ Everything great has never come from the top down – we ca n’t look to the government to be brilliant , ” muses Corral .
“ They maintain the status quo , that ’s how they keep their jobs .
We are the ones that are brilliant , we are the dreamers .
It ’s the people .
It ’s always the people .
And it ’s the force of the people – the will and the force of the people that changes governments minds .
That ’s our job . ”
