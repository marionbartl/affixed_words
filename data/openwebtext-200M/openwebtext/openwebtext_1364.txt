A man mistakenly shot six times in his home last September by a Phoenix police officer filed a notice of claim against the city Monday seeking $ 5.75 million in damages for himself and his family .
Phoenix Officer Brian Lilly shot Tony Arambula on Sept. 17 after Phoenix police responded to an early evening call about an intruder in Arambula 's central Phoenix home , the claim states .
A Phoenix police spokesman declined Tuesday to comment on any aspect of the shooting or the pending litigation , but confirmed that Lilly had returned to work after being placed on temporary administrative leave .
The notice of claim filed by Michael Manning , Arambula 's attorney , names the city , its police department , Lilly and two other officers .
Manning has successfully sued local police agencies in the past over use of excessive force .
Arambula accuses Lilly and the department in his claim of recklessly using excessive force against him and trying to �callously cover it up . �
Arambula , 35 , gave this account on Tuesday :
The evening of the shooting , Arambula was sitting on his couch watching cartoons with his 2 - year - old son when shots were fired through his living room window .
Thinking it was a drive - by shooting , he grabbed his son and crawled away from his window .
His wife , Lesley , ran from a bedroom to see what was going on .
Arambula handed the 2 - year - old to her .
By that time , an intruder � later identified Angel Anastacio Canales � had broken in through the living room window .
With a 9 millimeter gun in his hand , he ran into his 12 - year - old son 's room .
Tony Arambula , a licensed gun owner , grabbed his own gun and followed Canales into the bedroom .
His son was hiding in the closet .
Canales was trying to crawl underneath the boy 's bed .
Holding the intruder at bay , Arambula ordered Mathew to find his mother and call 911 .
Arambula also called 911 , telling the operator that he was holding the man at gunpoint .
Meanwhile , officers already chasing Canales arrived in the Arambulas ' backyard .
Lesley and her boys were outside .
� I told them my husband was inside , he was the one with the gun , '' she said Tuesday .
She pleaded , � Please do n't shoot . �
The officers entered the house with a shout of � Police ! �
Almost immediately , Lilly shot Tony Arambula in the back , spinning him around .
Three more shots were fired at him , one hitting him in the arm .
When Arambula fell to the floor , the claim asserts , Lilly shot him two more times .
The shot in back left a gaping exit wound in Arambula 's abdomen that was large enough to fit an eight - ounce cup , the claim charges .
That 's when Arambula told Lilly he'd shot the wrong man .
There was an eerie quiet , Arambula recalled .
Later , in his Internal Affairs interview , Lilly admitted firing at Arambula without any verbal warning , according to the claim .
A tape of the 911 call cited in the claim quotes Lilly as telling his supervisor moments later , � We ( expletive ) up . �
Sgt. Sean Coutts asked Lilly where Arambula 's gun was when he fired .
� I do n't know , '' Lilly responded , according to the claim .
� I heard screaming and I fired . �
Coutts reportedly responded , � That 's all right .
Do n't worry about it .
I got your back � .
We clear ?� according to a transcript reproduced in the claim .
Canales was apprehended peacefully .
Arambula 's eyes filled with tears Tuesday as he described officers dragging him outside by his left leg .
He said he pleaded with officers not to let his family to see him die .
� I was pretty sure I was n't going to make it , � he said .
A hospital stay of almost a week was followed by two months of at - home care .
Today , he wears a brace on his left hand and there are two metal brackets holding his arm to his hand .
Doctors have told him that he will have pain for the rest of his life .
Arambula said Tuesday that he did everything he was supposed to in that situation .
� I would have loved if they would have told me to get on the floor and drop to my knees , � Arambula said .
� To not have given me any opportunity to not get shot , it 's confusing .
I pray that this never happens to another family . �

Hot Plate wins the award for the day 's most literally named gadget .
The plate itself is a normal ceramic circle , but it has circuitry printed on it in the form of " silk - screened gold and amorphic metal films " .
These are hooked up to a DC power supply and the printed circuit acts like a heating element , sloughing off its resisted electricity in the form of heat and warming ( or even cooking ) any foodstuffs on top , working just like a car - window de-icer element .
The plate was designed by Ami Drach and Dov Ganchrow for a competition named " Dining In 2015 " .
Even when not plugged in , the filigreed heating strips make a curiously beautiful pattern .
The problem is that , with the DC - in circuitry in a plastic box underneath , this is n't going to be dishwasher safe .

For the 2010 Detroit auto show , the distressed global auto industry turned its back on far - fetched concept vehicles in favor of something more practical .
Cars that sell .
The automakers have largely dispensed with wild concept vehicles in favor of comparably frugal cars that the average consumer can afford .
It makes for less interesting theater but more profitable businesses .
General Motors and Ford are examples of automakers that leveraged high - profile press conferences at the auto show to introduce vehicles for the common consumer - cars they believe to be critical to their future .

Ford introduced the redesigned Focus , and GM unveiled the redesigned Chevrolet Aveo , for example .
Both cars will be relatively affordable and rely on conventional gas engines , though an electric version of the Focus is also under development .
Toyota , too , trained its eye on frugality .
The Japanese automaker revealed the FT - CH hybrid concept vehicle , which would cost less than its popular Prius and get better gasoline mileage .
The focus on frugality is a direct response to the contraction in the economy , as consumers pinch pennies and refuse to buy lavish vehicles .
“ It ’s no secret , the America ( n ) market has changed dramatically within the past few years and we expect still more shifts in the competitive landscape , ” said Mark Fields , Ford ’s president of The Americas .
Transitioning to a focus on smaller , cheaper , more fuel - efficient cars is possible partly because of the crisis itself , said David Cole , chairman of the Ann Arbor - based Center for Automotive Research .
The crisis allowed the automakers to reduce labor costs , cut debt through bankruptcies and make their operations more efficient .
The domestic automakers have extracted between $ 4,000 and $ 6,000 in costs from each vehicle , Cole said .

“ We ’ve never seen anything like the cost reduction that ’s in the process of occurring , ” Cole said .
“ The numbers are gigantic .
You can put a lot more value into the small car when you have that kind of cost structure , which means that competitively you can do a pretty good small car , put a lot of value into it and appeal to somebody who does n’t have a lot of money to spend . ”
The average cost of buying a new car has been dropping for years - partly due to better technology , global competition , economic forces and consumer demand .
In the third quarter of 2005 , the average new vehicle cost 26.2 weeks of income for the median American family , according to Comerica Bank ’s Auto Affordability Index .
In the third quarter of 2009 , the average new vehicle cost 21.9 weeks of income .
That ’s the lowest since early 2004 , according to Comerica .

For the industry , the conclusion is that affordable vehicles are still selling .
Look no further than Korean automaker Hyundai , whose sales increased 8 percent in 2009 despite the industry ’s overall 21 percent decline , said Dave Zuchowski , Hyundai Motor America ’s vice president for national sales .
The company ’s U.S. market share rose from 3 percent in 2008 to 4.2 percent in 2009 , a major increase by industry standards .
Hyundai ’s inexpensive offerings include the Accent , which starts just over $ 10,000 .
But the automaker ’s success is n’t just about cost .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 said Hyundai had surpassed Honda as the most fuel - efficient auto manufacturer .
“ Our ongoing commitment is to remain the most fuel efficient manufacturer in the industry , ” Zuchowski said .
But fuel efficiency alone is not enough .
Most auto industry experts and executives agree that consumers are increasingly demanding more features , better design and improved fuel efficiency at the same price point .
“ Fuel efficiency , driving quality , safety , technology and craftsmanship .
To be successful , to be world class , we have to deliver on all of these , ” said Derrick Kuzak , Ford ’s group vice president for global product development .
Bruce Brownlee , senior executive administrator for external affairs for the 1,100 - person Toyota Technical Center in York Township , said “ affordability is a big part of our competitiveness . ”
But he said some consumers are seeking affordability , fuel efficiency and a roomy vehicle .
“ People want that .
They do n’t want to give up on the size of the car , ” Brownlee said .

The Big Idea : Josh Sundquist
What you want to hear vs. what you need to hear :
This is an eternal struggle with writers when they approach someone to read the drafts of their work .
What you want to hear ( “ It ’s brilliant !
Change nothing ! ” ) is sometimes very different than what you need to hear ( “ Here are the problems ” ) — so much so that even when we hear what we need to , we ’ll still fight against it .
Josh Sundquist knows of this struggle .
A cancer survivor turned motivational speaker , he had written a draft of what would eventually become his memoir Just Do n’t Fall : How I Grew Up , Conquered Illness , and Made it Down the Mountain .
He knew what he wanted to hear about it .
But was he ready for what he needed to hear ?
Let ’s find out .
JOSH SUNDQUIST :
“ My advice to you , ” the handwritten letter read , “ Is to throw away this draft of the manuscript and start over from scratch . ”
I was too young to understand it at the time , but I was lucky to receive such a letter .
Very , very lucky .
Most first - time authors , upon completing their manuscript , assemble an inner circle of friends and family to read over the draft and give their honest feedback as to whether they think it ’s ready to be submitted to agents .
But therein lies the problem with this practice .
Friends and family are inherently biased to like anything you produce and tell you what you want to hear .
You are a genius .
This is a surefire bestseller .
It would make a great movie , too , probably staring somebody really famous .
What an author needs instead is an impartial reader , someone who does n’t know him personally .
There are two ways to find such a person .
Number one , you could approach a random individual in a bookstore or some other place book readers tend to congregate ( say , Whole Foods ) , hand her your manuscript , and hope she has an unnaturally strong inclination towards lending her free time to strangers .
Number two , you could pay for feedback from a professional .
But most first time authors do n’t have that kind of money .
I know I did n’t back when I wrote my initial draft .
Which is why I went with option one : Getting lucky with a near stranger .
That , of course , is the very definition of high risk behavior ( in writing and otherwise ) , but I was fortunate in that I received the aforementioned painfully honest handwritten letter in response to my request for feedback .
I was only sixteen years old at the time .
As it happened , I had been featured in a national newspaper for the motivational speaking career I had recently launched .
I was traveling to schools across the country , talking about how I had lost my leg to childhood cancer and gone on to become an internationally ranked ski racer .
After it was published , I sent the writer of the article my manuscript and asked if he ’d read it .
He was a professional journalist , I figured , so maybe he ’d have some helpful suggestions .
He did .
And that ’s how I found myself reading his handwritten note telling me to throw away my life story as I ’d written it and start over .
“ You to need to tell us what it was really like for you , ” he wrote .
“ You ’re hiding behind motivation . ”
He was right .
It was a habit I ’d developed on stage as a fledgling speaker , coupling motivational clichés with an I ’m - so - perfect - and - heroic version of my story .
But it would n’t be until I returned to writing in my mid-twenties that I was ready to take his advice .
Back in the first draft , for example , I wrote about my amputation like I was some kind of inspirational wunderkind , perfectly resolute in my bravery even at the tender age of nine .
Why I wrote this way , I ’m not sure .
I guess it was a role I thought I was supposed to play as a motivational speaker .
But when I wrote the new draft , I was ready to share the real story , the story of how for weeks leading up to the amputation I would sit in bed and hold my leg and cry myself to sleep .
I was n’t brave .
I was n’t inspirational .
I was just a boy facing the fact he ’d never play soccer again .
When I took drafts of this new manuscript to friends and family , I received warnings that certain passages were overly raw and revealing , that they were dangerous to my career as a motivational speaker .
But this time around , I knew these readers were too close to me , that they just wanted to protect me , that they in fact loved me too much to be able to step back and understand my big idea :
Writing a memoir that connects on a deep , human level means writing a memoir that strips off the public mask and exposes the deeply flawed and frail child hiding underneath .

Biden vows the US will appeal in Iraq Blackwater case
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
US Vice - President Joe Biden says the US government will appeal against a court ruling dismissing manslaughter charges in the Blackwater shootings case .
Mr Biden was speaking after meeting Iraqi politicians in Baghdad .
Iraqis were furious when a US judge threw out charges against five Blackwater security guards over the 2007 killing of 17 Iraqis in Baghdad .
Mr Biden is in Iraq in an attempt to defuse a political crisis over candidates for the election in March .
Class action Mr Biden said the dismissal of the Blackwater charges was just that and " not an acquittal " .
Expressing " personal regret " over the 16 September 2007 shootings in Baghdad 's Nisoor Square , he said the US justice department would file its appeal against the court 's decision next week .
THE BLACKWATER INCIDENT 16 Sep 2007 - 17 Iraqi civilians killed in Nisoor Square , Baghdad Iraq said - civilians fired on by Blackwater guards without provocation Blackwater said - Iraqis killed in shoot - out when Blackwater convoy ambushed Iraqi eyewitnesses - guards fired on white sedan that failed to slow down and then fired into surrounding area as people tried to flee Nov 2007 - New York Times quotes FBI officials saying killings of at least 14 of the Iraqis were " unjustified " Dec 2008 - five guards charged with 14 counts of manslaughter
Blackwater case :
What happened CIA cancels Blackwater contract Judge dismisses Blackwater case " The United States is determined to hold to account anyone who commits crimes against Iraqi people , " Mr Biden added .
" While we fully respect the independence and the integrity of the US judicial system , we were disappointed with the judge 's decision to dismiss the indictment , which was based on the way some evidence had been acquired . "
Iraq maintains the Blackwater guards fired without provocation .
Blackwater said the firing followed an ambush on one of its convoys .
The US rejected attempts for a trial in Iraq but charges in the US were thrown out when a judge ruled in December that the guards ' constitutional rights had been violated and that the justice department had mishandled evidence .
The ruling provoked anger in Iraq and this month the Iraqi government began collecting signatures for a class action lawsuit on behalf of people killed or wounded in incidents involving Blackwater .
Iraq said it would seek compensation for a number of such cases and would continue to " act forcefully and decisively to prosecute " .
The 2007 incident caused widespread public anger against foreign security companies operating in Iraq and their activities have been severely curbed since then .
Election concerns Mr Biden 's comments came as he tried to defuse a political crisis over the banning of more than 500 candidates in the March election , many on suspicion of loyalty to Saddam Hussein 's dissolved Baath Party .
Many Sunnis are outraged , saying their community is being marginalised , but many Shias are adamant Baathists cannot be rehabilitated .
Mr Biden met PM Nouri Maliki and President Jalal Talabani among others .
Mr Maliki , a Shia , has generally backed the disqualifications but Mr Talabani , a Kurd , has questioned the legality of the commission which issued the disqualifications , referring it to the supreme court for a ruling .
Mr Biden said he was confident there would be a solution .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says both the US and UN are increasingly worried that the March elections could become discredited .
He says the Americans will be eager for the elections to foster national reconciliation so the withdrawal of troops can be achieved against a stable background .
Although violence has lessened in Iraq over the past two years , security remains fragile .
Both Iraq and its Western backers see the March election as a crucial test of whether peace can be made sustainable .

Private equity funds are the bottom feeders of capital .
They buy up what they judge to be undervalued companies , take a chainsaw to jobs and costs to increase the seeming value of the company in the short term and then flog the entity off at a large gain a little later .
They themselves add no real value to entities or the productive processes of capitalism .
They effectively expropriate from other more traditional expropriators the surplus we create .
That ’s why Rupert Murdoch and his Australian newspaper hate them .
For example a recent editorial in The Australian said :
By their nature , they have a strong propensity for short - termism , tricky accounting practices , asset stripping … and tax minimisation .
Often nominally based in tax havens , such companies have no loyalties to any nation , any industry , any established company or any workforce , no matter how productive and experienced .
by focusing on the bottom line they often distort traditional productive capitalism .
They were , before the global financial crisis , also often heavily debt funded to wipe out any income for tax purposes while the vulture capitalists held the investment , readying it for re-sale .
It is no surprise then that these Vikings of capital care little for tax or indeed other niceties .
Take Texas Pacific Group .
TPG , as part of a consortium , bought Myer in 2006 .
In 2009 , replete with Jennifer Hawkins ’ advertising , it floated Myer to the public .
TPG made almost $ 1.5 billion profit on the deal last week .
Within a few days the money was out of Australia .
The Tax Office has claimed that there was a $ 452 million tax debt and has also imposed a tax avoidance penalty of $ 226 million .
Let me explain in fairly simple and simplistic terms how this came about .
I want to stress I do not have any ‘ inside ’ knowledge of the arrangements and know only of the ‘ facts ’ from newspaper reports .
In 2006 Australia changed its capital gains tax laws .
( I want to stress I am talking about capital gains tax , not ordinary income like salary or wages or interest or business income ) .
The change meant ( with some big exceptions ) that non-residents like TPG would no longer be subject to capital gains tax .
The logic was that these non-residents would be taxed on any capital gains in their home country .
Of course structuring the ownership through tax havens may make a mockery of that .
Most capital exporting nations have such a rule and although Australia is a capital importing nation the argument goes that we will become a capital exporting nation soon enough and so we should adjust our international tax regimes ( including the taxation of foreign residents ’ capital gains ) accordingly .
We did .
Now there is one problem with this analysis .
TPG ’s profits are not capital gains .
Private equity groups like TPG are in the business of making profits from their pillaging of undervalued companies .
This makes the gain income .
So the exemption does n’t apply and the gain should be taxed as ordinary income .
Let me try to use an analogy .
The gain on your home , something you hold for decades , is a capital gain .
But if you buy a house , with the intention of doing it up and then flogging it off for a profit , that gain is income , not capital .
You are in the business of buying , improving and selling such houses , so any gain is business income .
In the Myer case , TPG ownership seemingly starts with the Cayman Islands ( a tax haven until 29 October this year , although a leopard never really changes its spots even if there are Tax Information Exchange Agreements in place ) then Luxembourg and the Netherlands and onto Australia .
Of course hiding behind the Cayman Islands stand companies in the US .
So you have a conga line of countries through which ownership passes to stop authorities like the ATO pursuing the money through these bank and tax secrecy countries and preventing the home country ( such as the US ) imposing tax on the receipts ( or so I would guess ) .
Why route an investment from the US into Australia via the Cayman Islands , Luxembourg and the Netherlands ?
Why not do it directly ?
Avoiding tax is the answer , I suspect .
The Netherlands gives a veneer of respectability to the arrangement but it is respectability in name and appearance only .
Because of its porous and flow through tax regimes , and the fact it is a developed country with double tax agreements with most major economies it is a favoured destination for tax avoiders .
Think James Hardy for example .
A few days after the Myer float the ATO got an injunction freezing the accounts the TPG money from the Myer sale went into .
They were too late .
There was only $ 45 left .
Now , while the ATO may well get a debt judgement against the companies involved , the ATO in all likelihood will not be able to enforce it in foreign jurisdictions .
As long as TPG never comes back to Australia they might have ‘ avoided ’ tax here .
A criminal investigation and pursuit of the money would be a different matter .
Why was the ATO so slow ?
Over the last five or so years the Tax Office has run down its specialist international area so it is only a shell of its former self .
International expertise , both technical and compliance based , has plummeted .
The Myer float has been in the public arena for at least four months .
The argument that the gains are on revenue account , not capital account , is not rocket science .
Indeed , from memory , my ATO International New Measures Team advised Treasury of this very point in discussions before the draft Bill exempting foreign residents from capital gains tax was finalised and passed .
( The Explanatory Memorandum on the Bill may make the same point .
I would have to check . )
Again from memory we pushed within the ATO for a ruling or similar on the issue .
Clarification of the exemption was also , I believe , raised at a number of consultative forums .
But the ATO is so starved of technical experts and the workload is so great that it has to prioritise priorities , and not unreasonably expects new law to be able to tell tax experts the bleeding obvious – business income is not capital gains .
So any decent tax adviser ( and TPG would have had some very decent tax advisers ) would have known of the income / capital risk .
They might also have told TPG that even if they could convince a court this was a capital gain , they might still have to pay tax on any capital gain associated with TPG having an office in Australia ( which they did ) .
And the advice would have presumably encompassed the real possibility that the general anti-avoidance provisions would scuttle the arrangement .
These real tax risks may perhaps explain the apparent haste in withdrawing the money from Australia and putting it seemingly out of the reach of Australian tax authorities .
This does n’t mean the ATO will win .
It may for example have to show the gains are , under the double tax agreement with the Netherlands , business profits associated with a permanent establishment ( e.g. an office ) in Australia .
And using Part IVA , the general anti-avoidance provision , is always a risk .
TPG claims it has not avoided any Australian tax .
If they are so confident that this is the case why not voluntarily remit half the tax and penalties in dispute back to Australia ’ pending resolution of the dispute ?
Come on TPG , show us your bona fides .
It is not surprising that the venture capitalist association and various tax commentators have painted TPG as an innocent victim of a rapacious ATO .
This is bunkum .
They know the exemption does n’t apply to business income , although they might wish it did .
Now it is true that some in the ATO hate the international tax reforms of the last seven years and see them as an affront to any sense of tax equity .
These officers have yet to learn that , to think within bourgeois parliamentary terms , these are policy decisions of and for Government , not the ATO .
The Office ’s sole ‘ policy ’ role these days is to advise on administrative aspects of policy development , not the policy itself .
Having said that ( and it really is a story for another day ) the actions of the ATO in trying to prevent money leaving the country and pursuing this tax debt against TPG are perfectly legitimate .
Late , but legitimate .
The ATO is attempting to enforce the law as it stands , not as some commentators and tax advisers would want it to be .
Private equity funds add no real value to Australian society .
And as TPG shows , they may attempt to avoid tax altogether .
Where is the political outrage from the Government and Opposition about this pillage of our society ?
Silence is all I have heard to date .
An enquiry into the impact of these vultures on Australian society is overdue .
For the last month Australian politics has been racked by debates about a couple of hundred refugees trying to come to Australia .
Yet when one private equity fund allegedly scarpers with $ 452 million of our tax money , our politicians are silent .
If the choice is between refugees or rich revenue refuseniks , I ’ll take the refugees and their productive possibilities any day .
As a former Assistant Commissioner in International in the ATO , I have written a number of articles on tax on this site .

Rafael Benítez will have to rely on the £ 1.5 m capture of Maxi Rodríguez and possibly one loan signing to revitalise Liverpool 's squad during this transfer window even if the club succeed in raising more than £ 16 m through player sales .
The Liverpool manager had expected to operate this month under the same financial constraints that existed throughout 2009 at Anfield : namely , spending no more than he can bring in from sales .
Even that model now seems optimistic , however , with Benítez likely to be restricted to signing Rodríguez on an 18 - month contract from Atlético Madrid plus one loan deal as he attempts to fulfil his guarantee of qualifying for the Champions League for a sixth successive season .
Liverpool are making good progress in their efforts to offload much of the dead wood in Benítez 's squad by the end of January , and all for permanent transfer fees .
Andriy Voronin and Andrea Dossena are close to joining Dynamo Moscow and Napoli respectively , Philipp Degen is the subject of interest from several sides in the Bundesliga , while the Anfield club have also rejected a bid in excess of £ 8 m from Birmingham City for their unwanted Holland forward , Ryan Babel .
Yet Benítez 's hopes of strengthening his attack with a firm offer for the Aston Villa and former Liverpool striker Emile Heskey , for example , are expected to be dashed , as such a deal would be beyond his resources .
Liverpool insiders claim the constraints have not been imposed on Benítez by the club 's owners , Tom Hicks and George Gillett .
Executives believe players bought in the January transfer window are habitually overpriced and the club would rather save the income from sales to build a war chest for the summer .
But there will be immense disappointment at the latest financial balancing act for a manager who last month confirmed the need to reduce the Americans ' debt on Liverpool had taken precedence over investing in a squad that finished runners - up in the Premier League last season .
Benítez may therefore be tempted to retain players on the periphery of his plans , and he announced at the weekend that Babel would not be leaving Anfield this month .
" At this moment we are not trying to sell him , " said the Liverpool manager , following the FA Cup draw at Reading .
Liverpool have since received and rejected an offer from Birmingham that would allow them to recoup much of the £ 11.5 m paid to Ajax for Babel in 2007 , although the club 's stance may be influenced by a desire to encourage an auction for the disillusioned 23 - year - old .
Besiktas , Galatasaray and Juventus have all been linked with Babel , and several Spanish clubs are also interested .
Liverpool would prefer to sell Babel to a European club than risk him fulfilling his promise at a domestic rival , but Birmingham may withdraw their interest and pursue alternative targets should an auction develop .
While there is uncertainty over where Babel will be employed next month , Liverpool 's hopes of finally getting rid of Voronin and Dossena for good are close to being realised .
Benítez tried to sell the former , a free transfer from Bayer Leverkusen in 2007 , and Dossena , a £ 7 m arrival from Udinese in 2008 , last summer only to be thwarted on both fronts .
CSKA and Dynamo Moscow have made offers for Voronin of between £ 1.5 m and £ 2 m , with the latter club the favourites to clinch the deal after holding talks with the player yesterday .
Napoli are close to taking Dossena back to Italy for a fee of £ 4.4 m .
Degen is also available this month providing a fee can be agreed with Liverpool .
The Anfield club are poised to sign the Argentina international Rodríguez , despite interest in the right - sided midfielder from Boca Juniors , after improving their offer from an initial loan arrangement to a permanent 18 - month transfer .
Once the fee and wages for Rodríguez have been accounted for , however , Benítez could be limited to only one other loan deal .
I recently took the opportunity to reboot several pieces of my technology stack .
The coolest perhaps is my new 6 - monitor machine running Ubuntu Karmic .
It is nontrivial to be comfortable that everything ( CPU , GPUs , monitors , OS ) will play nice together so I ’ll detail exactly what I did so that others can repeat it if they want .
One caveat : I do n’t have visual effects working yet , but I do n’t find them especially useful so that was not a big issue for me .
My motivation for doing this come from a couple of observations .
First of all , there has been some research that shows that having more screen space increases productivity .
This is partly due to the cost of context switching –if you bring up one application on top of another and go back , it can take a few seconds to reorient yourself .
Physical context switching is easier–if you look a different way to see different information , and it is always in the same place , it is easier on your primitive mammalian brain .
Moreover having more screen real estate reduces the need for storing the contents of the other windows in working memory .
For example , I often work with emacs for latex , evince output , and evince and browser references .
If I can have them all visible at once I can refer between them without having to context - switch and remember information .
This frees working memory for harder stuff like math .
My philosophy is that if I have overlapping windows , I ’m paying some context - switching price .
The other hope is that certain tasks will get much easier .
One of these is parallel programming .
With a lot of screen real estate , it is easy to monitor what a bunch of machines are doing in real time and get a sense for where the inefficiencies are .
This is related to the reasoning behind the most prolific users of multi-monitor setups , traders .
Enough UI philosophizing , on to the setup .
The result is a 8gb RAM , quad core 2.8 Ghz system rendering 6144×2304 for over 14 million pixels , for well under $ 4 k .
It is quite hard to find a vendor who will build you a 3 GPU system ( the big guys generally do n’t do 3 GPUs at all ) and guarantee that it will work on Ubuntu or any Linux .
I decided to go with JNCS , as they had built me a workstation a couple years ago which is still going strong even after several moves .
The new machine is as follows ( link to the exact configuration except the RAM ) :
Antec 300 mid-tower
550 Watt power supply ( you should go larger if you plan on high - power video cards )
Asus P7P55 - WS motherboard , socket 1156 , supporting 3 - way NVIDIA SLI
Intel I7 - 860 LGA1156 at 2.8 Ghz , quad - core , eight threads
4 Kingston 1333 2GB sticks of RAM
WD Caviar 500GB HD
Three 9500GT 512 mb video cards , each with dual - dvi outs .
DVD -RW lightscribe
I recommend calling them to place the order , as it is a little unusual .
Make sure you tell them to build it with Ubuntu Karmic and 6 monitor support .
It should run you around $ 1800 .
The video cards are n’t super - high - powered , but they are more than adequate for the purpose .
Next I bought 6 Samsung SyncMaster 2343 23 ″ monitors from Newegg ( on the Samsung website ) .
These offer an unusually high 2048 × 1152 resolution and I felt provided the best resolution bang for the buck , but any matched monitors will work .
You can find them at Newegg and elsewhere for about $ 200 - $ 210 , less if you risk open - box .
It looks like they might be sold out at the moment , so the crucial thing to check is the weight and dimensions ( vs the stand spec ) , and VESA 100 mm compatibility in other monitors .
22 ″ monitors can be found for $ 150 if you do n’t mind a little smaller screen and resolution .
The monitors go in a Hex stand made by ergotech and found at http://www.ergonomicbusinesssolutions.com/product.asp?specific=643 .
It is rated up to six 24 ″ monitors but I ’m not sure I would try it .
This is about $ 560 and it comes flat - pack .
It is easy to assemble , but get some extra VESA mounting screws as mine was missing a few .
Both stand and monitors have 100 mm VESA mounts .
Note that the bottom row mounts tilt straight to slightly upward while the top row tilts slightly down .
The total price should be around $ 3600 , less than a high - end MacBook Pro , or what some vendors will charge you for the mounted screens alone .
Once you get all the pieces , it took me less than a couple hours to get up and running .
You need a Phillips head screwdriver to install the VESA mounts , and the stand assembles with a provided Allen wrench .
I plugged in the monitors as the transpose of the physical layout , so the top left DVI port matched the top left monitor , the top right port the bottom left , and so on .
On boot only the top left monitor will work until you finish the setup dialog .
The one software wrinkle I ran into is that out of the box only the top 3 screens ( the left DVI ports ) worked .
To fix this ,
sudo nvidia - settings
and configure the each of the other three monitors with Twin View ( not separate X screen ) , and to lie below its mate on the same video card .
Enable Xinerama .
Then save the configuration ( to xorg.conf as suggested ) and restart X by pressing Left - Alt , SysRq , and K .
A thing of beauty .
What I call the Weird Factor , for lack of a better name , seems to have become a permanent feature of our post - 9/11 world , a dark and sinister leitmotif that plays in the background .
On 9/11 , of course , the Factor was on full display as a whole string of unusual events and unexplained phenomena were visited on us .
The 9/11 Commission did little to clear these matters up , for the most part because they did n’t address them .
Just a few for the record : Bush reading My Pet Goat to schoolchildren after being told of the attacks , the sudden appearance of the " Israeli art students " – and their buddies , the " laughing Israelis " – in the months and weeks leading up to the attacks , and the apparent passivity of US air defenses on that fateful day .
I mean , how is it possible that the terrorists actually hit the Pentagon , the symbolic fortress of America ’s alleged military supremacy ?
After spending untold trillions on " defense " over the years , a sum that never declines in real terms , and driving ourselves into near - bankruptcy on account of it , how in the name of all that ’s holy did nineteen men armed with box - cutters manage to drive Don Rumsfeld stumbling into the street , literally running for his life ?
The Weird Factor seems to intensify whenever there is some significant event in our ongoing " war on terrorism , " or whatever they ’re calling it these days .
My longtime readers will be familiar with my theory of how this works .
Briefly : on Sept. 11 , 2001 , the impact of those airliners as they hit the Twin Towers sent us careening into an alternative dimension where up is down , right is left , and torture is the American Way – in short we landed in Bizarro World , where we have been trapped ever since .
The post -9/11 cognitive shift that heralded our entry into this alternate dimension is amplified around these incidents , and certainly the most recent – the midair antics of the Undie Bomber – underscores the Weird Factor at its absolute weirdest .
The official narrative has been in flux , due in part to the political firestorm that surrounds the event : President Obama ’s characterization of the Undie Bomber as an " isolated " individual , unconnected to a larger network , began to fall apart almost before it was uttered .
As the links between Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab and the specter of " al - Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula " surfaced – along with the incredible story of how Mutallab ’s father , a prominent Nigerian banker , personally reported his son to the US embassy and the CIA – the official story had to be amended .
Now it ’s " the buck stops here , " an admission of failure , and the inevitable calls for making everyone ’s flying experience more problematic and unendurable than ever .
Also inevitable was the way the Republicans leapt on the incident to somehow prove the President and his party are " soft " on terrorism , a strangely empty critique that does n’t seem to consist of anything more substantial than a highly arguable perception of " softness " in the President ’s rhetoric .
GOPers complained that the President did n’t use the word " terrorism " enough , that his tone lacked the requisite harshness , but when it comes to substantial differences over policy – or over the specifics of this case – the Republican critics come up empty .
I wo n’t be the first to point out that the Bush administration ’s response to the Richard Reid / Shoe Bomber incident was nearly identical to the Obamaites ’ on this very similar occasion .
Team Bush raised the threat level , imposed all sorts of new regulations and restrictions to make air travel decidedly more unpleasant , and were somewhat less self - critical than their successors .
In all of this politicized brouhaha , however , we hear not one word about the various anomalies clustered around al - Qaeda ’s latest – and most successful – post - 9/11 attempt to sow fear and confusion in the West .
I count three :
1 ) The well - dressed " Indian " man seen accompanying Mutallab at Amsterdam ’s Schnipol airport .
Michigan attorney Kurt Haskell , a passenger on the flight , was playing cards with his wife in front of the ticket desk when he saw what he considered to be a bit of an odd couple approach the desk and engage in a conversation with the attendant .
Mutallab , who looked to Haskell as if he might be a teenager , was dressed somewhat shabbily , and was accompanied by an older " well - dressed " man who looked and sounded like he might be a native of India .
When they approached the desk , the Indian did all the talking , explaining that Mutallab did n’t have a passport but needed to get on the flight .
The attendant replied that everyone on the flight had to have a passport , to which the Indian retorted that his companion was a Sudanese refugee , and " we do this all the time . "
Well , then you ’ll have to speak to my supervisor , said the attendant , and the odd couple went down a hallway : the next time Haskell saw this " refugee , " he was setting his underpants on fire in an attempt to down the plane .
Dutch security is now denying Haskell ’s eyewitness report , on the basis of having reviewed 200 hours of surveillance video .
Haskell , however , is sticking with his story , and has located another passenger who ( he says ) corroborates his account , but this witness is afraid to step forward out of fear of being in the spotlight .
Haskell also asks a reasonable question : why do n’t they release the surveillance video , just like the US authorities released video of that idiot in New Jersey who snuck through security ?
Additionally , there are all sorts of other questions that arise when we consider how the Dutch handled security at Schiphol in this instance : for example , all passengers at Schnipol are interviewed , an innovation introduced by the Israeli companies that provide security services there .
No doubt these interviews are videotaped , or at least there must be some account of the interview , either from interviewer or his notes : let ’s see them .
I refuse to believe that Mutallab , being interviewed and sitting there with a bomb in his underpants , was n’t sweating bullets at the very least .
How did he explain himself ?
What did the interviewer ask ?
These are questions that wo n’t be answered until and unless the Dutch are more forthcoming – and the media start getting more aggressive when it comes to uncovering questions of simple fact .
2 ) The " man in orange " arrested at the Detroit airport , who was on the same flight .
As Haskell tells it :
" Ever since I got off of Flight 253 I have been repeating what I saw in US Customs .
Specifically , 1 hour after we left the plane , bomb sniffing dogs arrived .
Up to this point , all of the passengers on Flight 253 stood in a small area in an evacuated luggage claim area of an airport terminal .
During this time period , all of the passengers had their carry on bags with them .
When the bomb sniffing dogs arrived , [ one ] 1 dog found something in a carry on bag of a 30 - ish Indian man .
This is not the so called ‘ Sharp Dressed ” man . ’
I will refer to this man as ‘ The man in orange . ’
" The man in orange , who stood some 20 feet away from me the entire time until he was taken away , was immediately taken away to be searched and interrogated in a nearby room .
At this time he was not handcuffed .
When he emerged from the room , he was then handcuffed and taken away .
At this time an FBI agent came up to the rest of the passengers and said the following ( approximate quote )
‘ You all are being moved to another area because this area is not safe .
I am sure many of you saw what just happened ( Referring to the man in orange ) and are smart enough to read between the lines and figure it out . ’
We were then marched out of the baggage claim area and into a long hallway . "
This account is backed up by Daniel Huisinga , an American from Tennessee , who was also on the flight and saw the " man in orange " being handcuffed and led away .
As Haskell points out , the explanation offered by US government officials has gone through a few different versions , from it never happened to it had nothing to do with terrorism .
So what ’s the real story ?
Our government is n’t saying – and our media is n’t asking .
3 ) The man who videotaped the entire flight .
Charlie and Patricia Keepman , of Oconomowoc , Wisconsin , who were sitting 20 rows behind Mutallab on the flight " said another passenger " sitting right in front of them " videotaped the entire flight , including the attempted detonation of explosives , " according to this news report :
" ’ This person actually was videotaping it , ’ Mr. Keepman told the Detroit News .
Mrs. Keepman told 620WTMJ ’s Wisconsin ’s Morning News :
‘ He sat up and videotaped the entire thing , very calmly .
We do know that the FBI is looking for him intensely .
Since then , we ’ve heard nothing about it . ’ "
The Keepmans ’ account is backed up by another passenger , Beau Taylor :
" Taylor was in seat 29A of the plane , and was about 10 rows back from Abdulmutallab when he allegedly attempted to stage an attack .
In the midst of passengers trying to subdue Abdulmutallab and flight attendants working to put out the fire , Taylor says he looked behind him and saw a man filming the situation about two to five rows back .
“ ‘ I looked behind me as the flight attendant ran through , and I looked and there was a guy with a camera , ’ Taylor says .
" Taylor says he notified the FBI of what he saw , in hopes of helping them to obtain footage of the foiled attack .
" ’ There ’s definitely footage from the time it was mission critical , to the time they hauled ( Abdulmutallab ) to the front , ’ Taylor says .
‘ I told them 100 percent there was a guy filming . ’"
In recording the entire flight , was the mystery cameraman inspired by Andy Warhol ’s film , Empire , an 8 - hour movie in which the unmoving camera was simply trained on the Empire State Building – or was a more sinister motive involved ?
See what I mean by the Weird Factor ?
All this is aside from the incompetence and missed signals that allowed the Undie Bomber to even get on a plane .
Our government officials are n’t addressing any of these other questions , nor are their Republican critics – who only want to know why the President does n’t launch an immediate invasion of Yemen .
None of the issues raised by these oddities are being addressed by anyone – except a very few ordinary Americans , like the Haskells and the Keepmans , who witnessed the Weird Factor in action .
I have no hypothesis to submit to my readers as to the meaning of the above : all I can say , at this point , is that there is a lot more to the Christmas Day incident than our government is letting on .
We do n’t yet have all the facts , but it is weird indeed that these particular facts are being steadfastly ignored .
What we do know is this : the bare bones scenario , aired by the President in his earliest remarks , is incorrect .
What we do n’t know – yet – is how much broader was the conspiracy to down flight 253 .
If the eyewitnesses are right , then the activities of Mutallab ’s well - dressed companion certainly point to a pro-terrorist auxiliary , of some sort , providing Mutallab with invaluable assistance .
This scenario is also implied by the " man in orange , " whose identity and whereabouts are a complete mystery at this point .
As for the person who videotaped the entire proceedings – I have no idea what to make of it .
It ’s the Weird Factor – and it ’s pretty strange , even considering how far down this particular rabbit hole we have gone .
Obama asks ' Heckuva job , Brownie ' George W. Bush to help with Haiti relief efforts
By Lori Price , www.legitgov.org 15 Jan 2010 Mega barf alert AND gag me with a chainsaw !
Because George W. Bush did * such * a great job responding to Hurricane Katrina ( aka blown levies ) , President Barack Obama is asking his killer drone soul mate to help with Haiti relief efforts !
Such a request assigns legitimacy to the illegitimate P_resident that was Bush , who was installed in a coup d'etat , and serves to permanently elevate Bush from war criminal and torturer ( Shock & Awe executor , Waterboarder - in - Chief ) to world - class humanitarian .
At this stage of the game , genuine leftists should actually hope and pray that the ' Birthers ' unearth ( or fabricate ) evidence that Barack Obama was not born in the US , because every day that passes this Wall Street front - man is chipping away at what 's left of the so - called progressive movement in America .
As a direct result of the constant compromising by this conciliator , Democrats are uninspired .
Even a ' Kennedy seat ' in blue Massachusetts -- safe for eons , politically -- is no longer safe from the Tea Baggers .
***** Obama enlists Clinton , Bush 43 14 Jan 2010 President Barack Obama has asked former Presidents [ sic ] George W. Bush and Bill Clinton to team up to coordinate and raise money for relief efforts in Haiti , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Thursday .
" Both of them have agreed to take part in this , " Gibbs said , adding that the White House will release more details in coming days .
Ex-presidents to lead Haiti funding effort 15 Jan 2010 President Obama has tapped former presidents sic ] George W. Bush and Bill Clinton to lead private sector fund - raising efforts for Haiti .
In a joint statement , George W. Bush and Clinton said , “ In the days and weeks ahead , we will draw attention to the many ways American citizens and businesses can help meet the urgent needs of the Haitian people . ’’
Obama called his predecessors Wednesday to ask them for their assistance because he thought Bush ’s decision to mobilize former presidents during the tsunami was a good one , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said yesterday .
Gibbs said the Obama administration ’s criticism of Bush ’s actions during the response to Hurricane Katrina were irrelevant .
“ I think if you asked George Bush whether the government acted up to its ability in responding to Katrina , I think the answer to that would be ‘ no , ’ ’’ Gibbs said .
“ The actions that were taken to deal with the humanitarian crisis from the tsunami , on the other hand , I think worked quite well . ’’

Whether you are an electronic music artist and Live is your canvas , a DJ using Live to mix or remix tracks , or a more traditional musician using Live on stage or in the studio , you will find the APC40 to be the intuitive , powerful instrument that directly links your inspiration with Ableton Live .
Direct Design
Because Akai Professional and Ableton designed the APC40 specifically for Ableton Live , you do n’t need to map its controls to talk to the software .
Just connect your laptop to the APC40 via USB and you 're ready to make magic .
The APC40 is plug and play , so you do n't need to install drivers .
First - time setup is literally three steps : load Ableton Live , plug in and power up your APC40 , and select the APC40 as Ableton Live 's controller .
That 's it .
No mapping , no setup , no hassles .
The APC40 comes pre-mapped for instant use with Ableton Live software , so if you 're new to it , you 'll find using the APC40 to be easy to get around on .
And if you 're an experienced Live user , you 'll be happy to note that you can custom - map every single knob , button , and fader on the APC40 to completely customize the controls for the way you like to work .
Virtual View
The APC40 talks directly to Ableton Live and Live talks directly to the APC40 .
This bidirectional communication makes the APC40 an advanced controller in that it can receive feedback from the software and display it on its clip matrix of 40 triggers and on LED rings surrounding each knob .
The clip matrix gives you an instant view of all clip statuses : what 's loaded , what 's playing , and what 's being recorded .
Each state displays on the matrix in a different color so you can get a quick picture of each clip current state .
You can shift your clip focus and get an overview of the clips you have loaded for your set .
The APC40 has 16 knobs , each surrounded by a ring of LEDs .
These LED rings make it easy to see your settings on dark stages , indicating the currently selected parameters ' values .
Do you drink coffee ?
I bet you will like it more hereafter because we will feel the incomparable charm of coffee art together .
Coffee foam art is , in short , making fancy coffee in various styles by using espresso , milk and chocolate topping .
It is not only a kind of enjoyment in taste but also in vision .
I believe coffee foam art is popular because it adds comfort and a special gift to an already dreamy and friendly drink .
Plus , when else do you get a chance to drink art ?
Never !
Looking at the following cups of coffee , appreciating the lovely animals , plants and characters on the surface , would you actually be able to drink such a fancy and pretty coffee ?
L'arrestation de Christophe , le 27 novembre , marque un palier dans la bouffée délirante d'Etat que l'on nomme pudiquement " affaire de Tarnac " .
Sa mise en examen situe le point où une procédure ne se poursuit qu'afin de se sauver elle - même , où l'on inculpe une personne de plus dans le seul espoir de maintenir le reste des inculpations .
En fait de " premier cercle " , Christophe appartient surtout au petit nombre de ceux avec qui nous discutons de notre défense .
Le contrôle judiciaire qui voudrait , pour l'avenir , lui interdire de nous voir est l'aberration de trop ; c'est une mesure consciente de désorganisation de la défense , aussi .
A ce point de torsion de toutes les notions du droit , qui pourrait encore exiger de nous que nous respections ces contrôles judiciaires et cette procédure démente ?
A l'absurde nul n'est tenu .
Il n'y a pas besoin de se croire au - dessus de la justice pour constater qu'elle est en dessous de tout .
Au reste , une société qui se maintient par des moyens si évidemment criminels n'a de procès à intenter à personne .
La liberté sous contrôle judiciaire est le nom d'une sorte d'expérience mystique que chacun peut se figurer .
Imaginez que vous ayez le droit de voir qui vous voulez , sauf ceux que vous aimez , que vous puissiez habiter n'importe où , sauf chez vous , que vous puissiez parler librement , au téléphone ou devant des inconnus , mais que tout ce que vous dites puisse être , un jour ou l'autre , retenu contre vous .
Imaginez que vous puissiez faire tout ce que vous voulez , sauf ce qui vous tient à coeur .
Un couteau sans manche auquel on a retiré la lame ressemble davantage à un couteau que la liberté sous contrôle judiciaire ne ressemble à la liberté .
Vous flânez sur un boulevard avec trois amis ; sous la plume des flics qui vous filochent , cela se dit : " Les quatre objectifs se déplacent en direction de ... "
Vous retrouvez après des mois de séparation un être qui vous est cher ; dans le jargon judiciaire , cela devient une " concertation frauduleuse " .
Vous ne renoncez pas , même dans l'adversité , à ce que toute amitié suppose de fidélité ; c'est évidemment une " association de malfaiteurs " .
La police et sa justice n'ont pas leur pareil pour travestir ce qui tombe sous leur regard .
Peut - être ne sont - elles finalement que cette entreprise de rendre monstrueux ce qui , aimable ou détestable , se comprend sans peine .
S'il suffit de ne se reconnaître dans aucune des organisations politiques existantes pour être " autonome " , alors il faut bien admettre que nous sommes une majorité d'autonomes dans ce pays .
S'il suffit de regarder les directions syndicales comme des traîtres avérés à la classe ouvrière pour ê tre d'" ultragauche " , alors la base de la CGT est présentement composée d'une série de dangereux noyaux d'ultragauchistes .
Nous désertons .
Nous ne pointerons plus et nous comptons bien nous retrouver , comme nous l'avons fait , déjà , pour écrire ce texte .
Nous ne chercherons pas à nous cacher .
Simplement , nous désertons le juge Fragnoli et les cent petites rumeurs , les mille aigreurs misérables qu'il répand sur notre compte devant tel ou tel journaliste .
Nous désertons la sorte de guerre privée dans laquelle la sous - direction antiterroriste voudrait nous engager à force de nous coller aux basques , de " sonoriser " nos appartements , d'épier nos conversations , de fouiller nos poubelles , de retranscrire tout ce que nous avons pu dire à notre famille durant nos parloirs en prison .
S'ils sont fascinés par nous , nous ne sommes pas fascinés par eux - eux que nos enfants appellent désormais , non sans humour , les " voleurs de brosses à dents " parce que , à chaque fois qu'ils déboulent avec leurs 9 mm , ils raflent au passage toutes les brosses à dents pour leurs précieuses expertises ADN .
Ils ont besoin de nous pour justifier leur existence et leurs crédits , nous pas .
Ils doivent nous constituer , par toutes sortes de surveillances et d'actes de procédure , en groupuscule paranoïaque , nous , nous aspirons à nous dissoudre dans un mouvement de masse , qui , parmi tant d'autres choses , les dissoudra , eux .
Mais ce que nous désertons d'abord , c'est le rôle d'ennemi public , c'est - à- dire , au fond , de victime , que l'on a voulu nous faire jouer .
Et , si nous le désertons , c'est pour pouvoir reprendre la lutte .
" Il faut substituer au sentiment du gibier traqué l'allant du combattant " , disait , dans des circonstances somme toute assez semblables , Georges Guingouin ( Résistant communiste ) .
Partout dans la machine sociale , cela explose à bas bruit , et parfois à si bas bruit que cela prend la forme d'un suicide .
Il n'y a pas un secteur de cette machine qui ait été épargné dans les années passées par ce genre d'explosion : agriculture , énergie , transports , école , communications , recherche , université , hôpitaux , psychiatrie .
Et chacun de ces craquements ne donne , hélas , rien , sinon un surplus de dépression ou de cynisme vital - choses qui se valent bien , en fin de compte .
Comme le plus grand nombre aujourd ' hui , nous sommes déchirés par le paradoxe de la situation : d'un côté , nous ne pouvons pas continuer à vivre comme cela , ni laisser le monde courir à sa perte entre les mains d'une oligarchie d'imbéciles , de l'autre , toute forme de perspective plus désirable que le désastre présent , toute idée de chemin praticable pour échapper à ce désastre se sont dérobées .
Et nul ne se révolte sans perspective d'une vie meilleure , hormis quelques âmes sympathiquement désespérées .
L'époque ne manque pas de richesse , c'est plutôt la longueur du souffle qui lui fait défaut .
Il nous faut le temps , il nous faut la durée - des menées au long cours .
Un des effets principaux de ce qu'on appelle répression , comme du travail salarié d'ailleurs , c'est de nous ôter le temps .
Pas seulement en nous ôtant matériellement du temps - le temps passé en prison , le temps passé à chercher à faire sortir ceux qui y sont - , mais aussi et d'abord en imposant sa propre cadence .
L'existence de ceux qui font face à la répression , pour eux - mêmes comme pour leur entourage , est perpétuellement obnubilée par des événements immédiats .
Tout la ramène au temps court , et à l'actualité .
Toute durée se morcelle .
Les contrôles judiciaires sont de cette nature , les contrôles judiciaires ont ce genre d'effets .
Cela va bien ainsi .
Ce qui nous est arrivé n'était pas centralement destiné à nous neutraliser nous , en tant que groupe , mais bien à impressionner le plus grand nombre ; notamment ceux , nombreux , qui ne parviennent plus à dissimuler tout le mal qu'ils pensent du monde tel qu'il va .
On ne nous a pas neutralisés .
Mieux , on n'a rien neutralisé du tout en nous utilisant de la sorte .
Et rien ne doit plus nous empêcher de reprendre , et plus largement sans doute , qu'auparavant , notre tâche : réélaborer une perspective capable de nous arracher à l'état d'impuissance collective qui nous frappe tous .
Non pas exactement une perspective politique , non pas un programme , mais la possibilité technique , matérielle , d'un chemin praticable vers d'autres rapports au monde , vers d'autres rapports sociaux ; et ce en partant des contraintes existantes , de l'organisation effective de cette société , de ses subjectivités comme de ses infrastructures .
Car c'est seulement à partir d'une connaissance fine des obstacles au bouleversement que nous parviendrons à désencombrer l'horizon .
Voilà bien une tâche de longue haleine , et qu'il n'y a pas de sens à mener seuls .
Ceci est une invitation .
Aria , Benjamin , Bertrand , Christophe , Elsa , Gabrielle , Julien , Manon , Mathieu et Yildune sont les dix personnes mises en examen dans l'affaire dite " de Tarnac " .

This picture shows Haitians salvaging food and goods necessary for survival from burning buildings .
But that is not how similar pictures have been captioned elsewhere .
Time magazine used virtually the same frame , but talked about a “ looting spree ” .
The us
I travelled to Port - au - Prince with a group of Haitians living in the US and the Dominican Republic .
Their common aim was to ensure that medical supplies were delivered to those who needed them .
They also wanted to see if their relatives were safe .
Everyone has harrowing stories to tell .
One young pregnant relative trapped by concrete gave birth to her child – they both perished .
Another told a story of a child who went back into the house to get a book and was killed by an aftershock .
Everywhere you look people are foraging amongst the rubble and twisted metal to find food and items to sell and re-use .
Existence in Haiti is fragile at the best of times .
Most Haitian people live precariously making a living in the informal street economy .
People sell everything from individual portions of cornflakes to sugar cane .
Many have seen their goods destroyed and have no way of generating income .
Those that have money cannot access it , and they cannot contact their relatives .
Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere .
It has been impoverished by colonial rule , slavery , the outrageous requirement to compensate former slave owners for the money they “ lost ” , US intervention , loan repayments and corrupt and incompetent rulers .
This situation is man-made .
Much anger is directed against the US , for the slow and inadequate rescue and aid response .
The general feeling is that this is Katrina all over again .
Carline Paul runs Haitian American Youth of Tomorrow , a Miami educational charity for families and new immigrants .
She took volunteers with medical supplies direct to the Haitian people with the help of the Dominican government .
“ We know the big bureaucracy has the bulk of the supplies and the logistical problems but we felt the people were in such dire need right now we needed to get the medical supplies direct to the people . ”
“ This is about poverty .
It is day 11 and people are still dying . ”
“ It 's worse than a war zone , ” says Jordy Cox , an American surgeon and volunteer for Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) .
She has just performed an operation in an outdoor makeshift theatre to save the arm of a 22 year old girl ( above ) .

In this post , I will talk about how I connected and interfaced with a PS2 Keyboard using an Arduino .
First we 'll start with the basics ; Soldering the PS2 port onto a strip board .
I soldered the PS2 port in front of a row of 6 female pin headers :
This setup will allow me push in wires into the headers to access the PS2 Port .
The following is a view from underneath , where the solder joints are :
As you can see , I had to cut two tracks .
This is because of the way the setup of the pins of the PS2 port is :
The tracks need to be cut where there are the red lines on the above picture .
Taking a look at the pins again :
We will be using the above four ( colored ) pins for our project ( the pin on the right of the VCC pin and the one below the VCC pin will not be used ) .
Next push in wires to the 6 female headers as follows ( Black , Yellow , White and Red ) : Next we need to connect the wires to the Arduino as follows :
When we push wires into the female headers and to the Arduino , we will have something like this :
Now all that 's left is to plug in the Keyboard to the PS2 Port .
To read the keystrokes with the Arduino , I used the following : PS2KeyboardExt2 , which is basically an extension of this library : PS2 Keyboard
So first download PS2 Keyboard and extract the library to your / hardware / libraries / folder and then download PS2KeyboardExt2 and overwrite theandfiles with the latter version .
The following is the code that you can use to capture the key strokes : Notice that directives KBD_CLK_PIN ( clock pin ) and KBD_DATA_PIN ( data pin ) are set to 3 and 4 respectively , and this corresponds to the way we hooked the PS2 port to the Arduino before .
Now after you compile and upload , open up the Serial Monitor and start typing .
You should get something like the following :
According to The Guardian , 20 years ago , four out of five Beijing residents pedaled around China ’s capital in some of the world ’s best bike lanes .
However , this number has decreased as private car ownership has gone up .
From 1995 to 2005 , China ’s bike fleet declined by 35 percent while private car ownership more than doubled .
Beijing is currently home to four million cars .
Last year , China overtook the U.S. in auto sales , with a 46 percent increase in sales over the previous year .
As cities in China have grown , bike lanes have also been eliminated to accommodate more traffic lanes for cars and buses .
By all indications , it ’s seemed that Beijing was well on its way to usher in a new king – the automobile .
But is the city of 17 million ready for king car ?
Perhaps not , as Beijing ’s air quality continues to be poor ( last week Beijing Air ‘s monitoring station reported a few ‘ hazardous ’ air quality days ) .
Liu Xiaoming , the director of the Municipal Communications Commission , said in a Xinhua article that the government will “ revise and eliminate ” regulations that discourage bicycle use and impose greater restrictions on car drivers .
Beijing already has limitations to reduce the number of vehicles on the road , continuing the odd - even license plate policy after its successful implementation during the 2008 Olympics .
( And read my post about Beijing ’s ban on “ yellow label ” vehicles here . )
The government also plans to restore bicycle lanes that were torn down , as well as to build more parking lots for bicycles at bus and subway stations to encourage additional cycling .
Also an improvement :
The city will make more bikes available for rent to defray the cost of owning a bike ( a new one can cost as little as $ 20 - $ 40 ) and allay fears of bicycle theft , a rampant problem in the city .
By 2015 , the number of bikes for rent will total 50,000 .
Today , only about 100 bicycle rental booths exist in Beijing , and owners are “ cautiously optimistic ” that the plans to increase rental bikes will be successful in reducing the number of cars on the road .
As a frequent cycler in Beijing , I am thrilled to see bicycles making a comeback and look forward to breathing in the benefits of these new policies .
If successful in producing the “ smoother traffic ” and “ clearer skies ” Beijing officials are hoping for , perhaps we ’ll see the return of the “ bicycle kingdom , ” with more cities following suit with cycling as part of a sustainable transportation solution .
As Tesla continues on its commendable journey to surpass Ford , GM , Toyota and everyone else in total sales , it 's evidently hoping a tie - up with Panasonic will help it accomplish said goal .
The two outfits have just agreed to work together in order to develop next - generation battery packs to be used within electric vehicles , which are based around " Nickel - based Lithium ion chemistry . "
It sounds as if the two are hoping the collaborative effort will actually be mutually beneficial , though both have been coy about when or where this research will lead to implementable results .
Hopefully we 'll end up with a Model S that can roll 724 miles on a single charge , but it 's not like we 'd complain ( much ) if we only got 722 .
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israel launched three air strikes in the Gaza Strip on Thursday , witnesses and the Islamist group Hamas said , after a day in which about a dozen mortar bombs and rockets fired from the territory struck inside the Jewish state .
There were no immediate reports of casualties from the attacks in Gaza City and Khan Younis which caused explosions , and sent smoke and flames shooting into the air .
There were also no casualties from the attacks on Israel .
The Israeli armed forces had no immediate comment .
The strike appeared to be Israel ’s first inside the crowded city of Gaza since a three - week offensive last January in which 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed .
Israeli media reports said Israel had targeted a weapons factory in Gaza City .
Hamas , an Islamic militant group that rules Gaza , said an Israeli warplane bombed a building in Gaza City that witnesses said appeared to belong to the Islamic Jihad militant group .
Militants barred reporters from reaching the area .
Israel later fired two missiles at targets in Khan Younis , a town in southern Gaza , witnesses said .
At least one of the missiles struck in an uninhabited area near a school , and there were no immediate reports of casualties .
Israel earlier distributed leaflets in Gaza , warning many of its 1.5 million residents to avoid areas within 300 metres ( yards ) of the border fence with Israel .
The mortar bombs and rocket fired at Israel earlier on Thursday caused no casualties , an Israeli military spokesman said .
The number of such attacks has been on the rise in the past few weeks after months of relative calm since the Gaza war .
Asked how managing to put them back on would feel , 29.1 per cent said it would be better than sex , 28.9 per cent thought it would beat a promotion , 20.6 per cent believed it would top a best friend 's wedding , 20.3 per cent said it would feel better than a lottery win and 11.1 per cent thought it would beat a marriage proposal .

Someone asked what I thought about Apple ’s iPad .
I wrote back :
This was the most hype I ’ve seen since Hope and Change .
The iPad is going to save publishing .
It ’s going to save marriages .
The blind will see and the deaf will hear !
Pay Steve Jobs a commission everytime you want to scratch your ass and golden rays of Glory will shine down upon you .
HA . Steve Jobs came off as a franchisee of a Reverend Wayne ’s Pearly Gates establishment .
I ’m sure his followers ate it up .
“ It ’s wonderful .
It ’s wonderful .
It ’s wonderful . ”
HAHA
Did you watch the keynote ?
You should .
It was a religious event .
All I see is a large iPod that serves as a tamperproof vending machine .
Can a platform get any more locked down than the iPad ?
Apple alone decides what ’s allowed to run on that thing .
No Flash .
What if someone needs to view a site that requires Flash ?
Personally , I block Flash content by default , but sometimes , I want it available .
No USB ports .
I guess you ’ll be able to buy an arrangement of dongles to restore functionality that should have been built in .
No thanks .
I ’m not even interested enough to find out more reasons why I would n’t go near that thing , but I ’m sure that there are many , many more .
This is n’t really a fair criticism of the device , but I refuse to use the web without Firefox running an array of filters and blockers .

GreenSun Develops Colorful Solar Panels That Don’t Need Direct Sunlight
September 17th , 2009 by Jeff Kart
Update ( May 2011 ) : a new type of semi- transparent , colored solar panels that can be used in place of windows , roofs , and walls has been developed by Qsolar .
Solar power comes in many forms , from rigid to thin film .
The panels are shiny , gleaming and ready to harness the power of the sun .
They ’re also usually silver .
Yet they also come in colors , not just for looks , but for efficiency .
A Jerusalem company called GreenSun has developed bright - colored panels .
Officials say the hues capture different parts of sun ’s spectrum , and do n’t need direct sunlight to work , according to National Geographic News .
The colored collectors are still in development , but the company says its panels will cost less than a buck per watt to manufacture , compared to more than $ 4 a watt for conventional solar .
The technology is based on concentrating visible and ultraviolet light without concentrating heat , which reduces the performance of conventional cells .
GreenSun also says its panels only require 20 percent silicon , with a conversion rate of up to 20 percent , or up to twice as much as commercial panels now on the market .
The secret is the edges , The Economist explains .
“ Traditional solar cells are made of thin sheets of the element covered by glass plates .
In GreenSun ’s cells , though , only the outer edges of the glass plates are covered by silicon , in the form of thin strips .
The trick is to get the light falling on the glass to diffuse sideways to the edges , so that the silicon can turn it into electricity . ”
GreenSun does this this by coating the glass “ with a combination of dyes and sprinkling it with nanoparticles of a metal whose nature they are not yet willing to disclose , ” according to the report .
If this works , it could brighten up the solar market in more ways than one .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
A galaxy far , far away could seem considerably closer if George Lucas 's plans to re-release the Star Wars films in 3D , apparently in emulation of James Cameron 's success , come to fruition
It 's been an interesting period for George Lucas watchers .
First came the Star Wars creator 's admission that it might be time to trot out his space opera series on the big screen once again - this time in 3D - in the wake of Avatar 's spectacular box office take .
Then , earlier this week , bloggers began to pick up on a new project which looks likely to be the next to emerge from Lucas Film , a CGI fantasy about fairies .
Not too many details have yet emerged of the latter movie , which has gone into preproduction at Skywalker ranch in California , with Lucas taking an executive producer 's role .
Kevin Monroe of TMNT ( the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated reboot ) is directing from a script by David Berenbaum of Elf and The Spiderwick Chronicles fame .
As a Lucas Film project , it 's likely that Lucas came up with the original idea :
If so , the movie would mark a rare foray outside the Star Wars and Indiana Jones universes for the film - maker .
While the fairies project is still firmly under wraps , Lucas did speak to Access Hollywood earlier this month to talk how Avatar 's spectacular success has reignited a long - held desire to bring all six Star Wars movies - and yes , that does mean the Phantom Menace et al - back to cinemas in stereoscopic vision .
" I liked it , " Lucas said , in reference to James Cameron 's megalith .
" I 'm happy it 's so successful , and worked very well in 3D .
Have n't been a big fan of 3D , but that movie definitely improves in the field of 3D .
" We 've been looking for years and years and years of trying to take Star Wars and put it in 3D , " he added .
" But the technology has n't been there .
We 've been struggling with it , but I think this will be a new impetus to make that happen . "
Of course , Star Wars has already been back on the big screen once before , in the mid 90s , when Lucas delivered new versions of the wonderful original trilogy with - in most cases - utterly superfluous and often hugely jarring CGI additions .
One can only hope that Lucas swallows his pride this time around and gets his minions at Industrial Light and Magic ( who also helped out on Avatar ) to produce special effects work which actually blends into the style of the original films .
Let 's lose the appalling scene in which Han Solo meets a CGI Jabba in Star Wars ( I refuse to call it A New Hope ) , the horrendously irritating digitised band in Return of the Jedi , not to mention the completely unnecessary addition of a beak and tentacles to the Sarlacc , which was always far more terrifying as simply a gap - toothed maw in the desert .
Beyond that , I can't really see too many arguments against bringing the films back in 3D .
Every 10 years or so there is a new generation who have n't had a chance to see them on the big screen , and these movies really are capable of inspiring children at entirely new levels .
Unfortunately , given Lucas 's refusal to accept that the later prequels experienced an enormous drop in quality in comparison to his earlier triptych , the chances are that we are likely to witness The Phantom Menace , Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith get the 3D treatment first .
I do sort of wonder whether there will be much demand for seeing these films again : their success , for me , was mainly predicated on the continuing reputation of the original trilogy .
People in their 20s and 30s bought tickets to The Phantom Menace in the hope of re-experiencing the joy which the earlier films had brought them as kids , then managed to persuade themselves that the next two instalments would surely be better .
But with the third film , Revenge of the Sith , having long been and gone , it 's apparent that none of these films really came close to capturing the spirit of their predecessors .
The later prequel films performed well at the box office , but will those who saw them the first time round really pay again to see them in 3D ?
What do you reckon to Lucas 's plan to bring back Star Wars once again ?
And does the idea of a LucasFilm produced CGI fantasy about fairies appeal to you ?
Answers on a post , please .
( CNN ) --
An Ethiopian airliner with 83 people on board crashed into the sea after takeoff from Lebanon early Monday , Lebanese army officials said .
The Boeing aircraft was en route from Beirut to the Ethiopian capital , Addis Ababa , when it disappeared from radar 30 minutes after takeoff from Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut about 4 a.m. local time , Lebanon 's National News Agency reported .
On board were 54 Lebanese nationals and 29 people of other nationalities , the army officials said .
No additional information was immediately available .
President Hugo Chavez , terrified , has threatened on national television to unleash a bloody pogrom against his political opponents and anyone who opposes him , meaning over half of the civilian population .
These are his precise words :
“ I warn , make no mistake , that the response that I would command would be radical at the hour that these sectors manage to or continue machine gunning guards , sending youths to throw rocks at garrisons , calling for rebellion openly … keep going as you are , and you will see … I come almost from the grave , almost from death ( after the coup of 2002 ) due to weakness and I saw dead persons here in front due to the weakness of a goverbment that I was leading , that will not happen again …
If they continue along this path they will force me to make radical decisions . ”
For at least the fifth time since the start of 2010 , Chavez also called on his political opponents to organize another presidential recall referendum .
Yesterday , President Chavez said the political opposition “ … still have the idea of killing me . ”
Then he said , “ If they start an offensive of hard violence that should obligate us to hard action … something I do not recommend … our response would sweep them away . ”
If the “ oligarchy ’s plans to assassinate me are successful , there will be a frightful reaction against the East of Caracas .
“ If you get desperate , it will be a thousand times worse for you , ” Chavez said .
Since the past weekend , different regime thugs including Diosdado Cabello and Jose Vicente Rangel ( JVR ) have made similar threats of mass slaughter against the middle class of Caracas .
Writing under the pseudonym “ Marciano ” in the pro-regime tabloid “ Vea , ” JVR says “ estamos llegando al llegadero , ” which translated to English means roughly , “ we ’re coming to a reckoning . ”
The situation in Venezuela has become a “ question of life and death , ” he adds .
Marciano writes , “ … the other face of the coin is death .
This is what would happen in Venezuela if that opposition rotted by hatred should reach power .
It already demonstrated this in the short - lived stage of Chavez ’s ouster when the fascist pack launched itself against the chavistas do finish them off .
If Chavez were to be toppled , blood would flood the streets of Venezuela ’s cities .
It is no small thing this chronicler is saying , but lamentably this is what would happen .
Let no chavista be fooled and let no one think of peaceful transitions .
Life or death . ”
Diosdado Cabello , referring to recent popular protests against Chavez at the Venezuelan baseball championship games at Central University ’s stadium in Caracas , asked menacingly , “ ¿What will happen if those who accompany the revolution go to the stadium and start a war ?
This is what they are provoking . ”
A few words in the president ’s rant today caught our attention : “ … continue machine gunning guards … ”
No guards have been machine gunned in the street battles which have erupted countrywide , since RCTV Internacional was shut down on 23 January , between unarmed student protesters and heavily armed National Guard and Metropolitan / National Police thugs .
So , what was Chavez referring to ?
Or was Chavez exaggerating and lying , as he is wont to do ?
Caracas Gringo ’s sources within the armed forces report that there was an aborted uprising less than two weeks ago .
Reports that at least three generals are under arrest are true .
In fact , the number of detained army officers is reported to be much larger than the regime has let on .
The sources also say at least that one officer – an army lieutenant colonel – was killed .
Moreover , the abrupt resignation of Vice President / Defense Minister Ramon Carrizalez is believed to be linked to the alleged aborted revolt within the army .
It ’s not clear what , if any , role Carrizalez might have played in the alleged revolt .
But the “ correo popular ” inside the army reports that Carrizalez believes Cabello is gunning for his head and was trying to set up Carrizalez .
Cabello , Rangel .
These are the president ’s most dangerous enemies .
Rangel , who like the cockroach survives everything , is the link between the old Fourth Republic financial sector bottom - feeders and the Bolivarian Fifth Republic ’s rats .
Cabello reportedly has more influence in the army than Chavez .
Both men recently may have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in wealth when Chavez intervened the Bolibourgeois banks this blog has written about since 3 August 2009 ( remember Ricardo Fernandez Barrueco ? ) .
It is odd that Cabello and Rangel – after Chavez – should be uttering the darkest threats of bloodshed , mass slaughter and war against the regime ’s political opponents , and against anyone who does n’t support Chavez , considering that the chief plotters against Chavez are , precisely , Cabello and Rangel .

In a distant galaxy , a race of humans called the Alterans experience a fundamental split in cultural governance .
The majority push for a religious focus , while a smaller group push for a scientific one .
Fearing extreme persecution , the small Alteran group choose against using technology which could brainwash their brothers and depart in a ship for a galaxy to call their own .
The scientific Alterans will henceforth be known as Ancients .

In efforts to control population growth , the government is planning to offer various facilities to parents who have only one child , Health Minister AFM Ruhul Haque told the parliament yesterday .
“ The government gives reception to parents for having one child to encourage people to have one child .
Discussions are on in government 's different level to offer different facilities to those having one child , ” the health minister said in a scripted answer .
In reply to another query , Ruhul Haque however said the government is planning to set a condition of ' two - child policy ' on getting jobs in family planning department .
He said the government will take measures to prevent private medical practitioners from taking excess fees from patients .
“ Doctors working in the government hospitals can not visit their private patients during office hour .
Stern action will be taken if any doctor violates this provision , ” the health minister warned .
In response to another query , he said the government has moved to update the policy for setting up private hospitals .
He said providing ambulances to all hospitals across the country are under process .
The health ministry and home ministry will jointly take necessary steps to amend the post mortem law , which was enacted during the British regime , he added .
In absence of the health minister , State Minister for Heath Mujibur Rahman Fakir replied supplementary queries of lawmakers in the House .
Tampa , Florida ( CNN ) -- Dianne McLeod recalls her husband , Stanley , getting so visibly upset when the debt collectors called that she had to take the phone away from him .
She believes constant harassing phone calls and other tactics eventually killed him .
" I think they were a major contributor to his death because of the stress and what I saw it doing to him , " she said .
McLeod is suing her mortgage company , Green Tree Servicing , for the wrongful death of her husband .
McLeod said she thinks he would be alive if not for the stress caused by Green Tree 's debt collectors .
She said they sometimes called up to 10 times a day and also called the McLeods ' neighbors .
" He would begin to sweat ; he would also get very red in the face and complain about chest pains , " McLeod said .
" We were worried he was gonna have a heart attack right there on the phone . "
Stanley McLeod had a heart condition and in 2002 was airlifted to a hospital after a second heart attack .
He went on disability and Dianne McLeod says they fell behind about three months on their mortgage payments .
This is a message left on the their home answering machine , allegedly by a male Green Tree representative :
" Stanley McLeod , you need to call Green Tree and get your act together and make your payments on your mortgage and quit playing these games .
" Why do n't you have that helicopter pick you up and bring that payment to the office ? "
It 's a phone call the McLeod family will never forget .
" It was so inhumane to talk to someone like that and to take an event that was traumatizing to him and to make a jest out of it , " McLeod said .
Stanley McLeod died of heart failure in 2005 .
" The collection activity did not lead to his death .
The claim is meritless , " said Senior Vice President and General Counsel Brian Corey of Green Tree Servicing .
" We deny that the content , the number or the timing of the calls had anything to do with him dying in 2005 , " Corey said .
Debt collection is regulated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission , which forbids harassing consumers .
Companies can be fined $ 16,000 per incident .
This year , as the economy plunged , consumer complaints shot up .
More than 45,000 complaints had been received by the FTC through the end of June , up about 20 percent over last year .
The Association of Credit and Collection Professionals represents about 5,500 companies in the industry .
" The vast majority are very ethical , caring individuals who look for resolution to problems , " said Adam Peterman , the organization 's director of federal government affairs .
" A bad apple can spoil the bunch too often , so we have to keep pushing that rock up the hill to help prevent that , " he said .
Billy Howard is an attorney who runs the Consumer Protection Division for Morgan & Morgan .
Howard represents McLeod and has about 500 similar cases against companies who use what he called " Tony Soprano tactics , " a reference to the fictional organized crime leader who was the central character in the HBO drama " The Sopranos . "
" I think it 's frightening because these companies go after people and they utilize tactics people just do n't know are illegal , " Howard said .
" Scare tactics work .
They 've worked for years .
That 's how the mafia made so much money .
That 's how these mafia - like tactics result in so much money .
People are scared , " he said .
Howard says one of his other clients had this message waiting on the answering machine :
" You 're a piece of s---.
That 's why you turned your phone off .
Mother f-----.
But that 's OK .
" You have n't heard the last of me .
But if it takes me a year or takes me two , believe me , I will find you .
You better move .
But if you move , you better move to California , ' cause I do travel .
And I like traveling .
Goodbye . "
And then there was this one :
" When I see you .
I 'm gonna f--- you up .
I want my money , and I want it now .
I hate people who lie to me and abuse my company .
...
If you bring my money back , you do n't have to worry about me , just disregard my message . "
The FTC said it receives more complaints about debt collectors than any other industry .
Complaints are also filed directly with attorneys general in all 50 states , which can open state investigations .
Of the 45,000 complaints received by the FTC in 2009 , the agency opened one investigation .
According to FTC officials , their primary role is to be a backstop to lawsuits brought by consumers , which is the primary way to fight the alleged abuse .
" We do n't have the manpower to individually investigate all of the complaints , " said Tom Pahl of the FTC 's division of financial practices .
" We try to target the worst actors , " he said .
The FTC urges consumers with complaints to report them to their state attorney general , to the FTC and to consider filing suit against the company they believe is harassing them .
Anna Inglett is president and CEO of PHG Financial Recovery Services in Tampa , Florida .
" Those companies that do that will eventually put their own selves out of business .
...
We want them gone .
We want them all gone , " she said .
But she also said debt collection is an important part of the economy .
" If we did not have debt collectors that helped businesses get the money that 's owed to them , then who voluntarily would pay any bills ? " she said .
McLeod said she remembers the endless phone calls at all hours of the day and night .
" They did not seem to care .
... They did n't care what they said or how many times they called , " she said .
The trial is scheduled to begin in January .

US President Barack Obama has used the lie of a just war to justify his killing of Afghan and Pakistani kids for the US profit system .
In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech the Commander in Chief of the most powerful killing machine by far in the world , the man who has just sent an extra 30,000 US troops to kill and maim in Afghanistan , said :
The concept of a “ just war ” emerged , suggesting that war is justified only when it meets certain preconditions : if it is waged as a last resort or in self - defense ; if the forced used is proportional , and if , whenever possible , civilians are spared from violence .
A just war is a justification for war .
In the hands of the powerful it becomes a tool for the subjugation and repression of others in order to retain and extend their positions of strength .
It is no accident that Augustine , a catholic thinker , developed the theory for the Roman Emperors when the Church became the dominant state power and as the Empire ’s power declined .
The Empire needed a theological and ideological justification for its bloody repression and the responses of the oppressed to it , and Augustine provided it .
A catholic website describes the justification for imperialist mass murder in the following terms :
The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force require rigorous consideration .
The gravity of such a decision makes it subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy .
At one and the same time : the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting , grave , and certain ;
all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective ;
there must be serious prospects of success ;
the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated .
The power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition .
These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the “ just war ” doctrine .
The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common good .
Yet it is all lies .
What drives the ‘ just war ’ is the need to protect and extend US economic influence around the world .
Islamic jihad of the sword is the equivalent of the Christian just war theory .
In the case of Muslims it is a jihad of the oppressed ( often the oppressed middle class ) against the oppressor .
Saying that is not to justify the actions of 9/11 or other attacks but to recognise that the major warmonger in society today is US imperialism , an imperialism which subjugates the Middle East for its own economic and political interests and as a consequence produces a backlash .
Nevertheless there is a symmetry in the views of Osama bin Laden and Barack Obama about a just war which cannot be ignored .
The difference is that bin Laden commands few troops and has little economic power to back up his murderous strategies and plans .
Obama has the most powerful military in the world , a military which currently has troops in over 100 nations around the globe and which is waging major wars in two countries right now .
The US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are wars of terror .
Israel ( and friendly dictators ) are the main weapons for the US to suppress the Middle East , although the American invasion of Iraq was a continuation of that strategy and an attempt to both control the future supply of oil to China and to cower other non-compliant nations .
In democratic societies the need to provide a range of justifications for war becomes important .
As Vietnam shows , sometimes rabid nationalism and the creation of a false enemy is not enough .
Patriotism wanes as the number of body bags increase .
In th US the catholic bishops used just war theory to support the invasion of Afghanistan .
They characterised the war as eliminating evil .
And yet the resident evil viewed objectively is not Al - Qaeda .
It is US imperialism , the use of American military and economic power to bend the rest of the world to the interests of US capital .
Let me quote again Thomas Friedman ( one of the most influential journalists in the US ) .
He wrote some years ago in his book The Lexus and the Olive Tree :
The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist .
McDonald ’s cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas , the designer of the U.S. Air Force F - 15 .
And the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley ’s technologies to flourish is called the U.S. Army , Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps .
That seems pretty clear to me .
The rest of the world is a cornucopia for US capitalism , ripe for the picking as they want .
To enforce this new world order US imperialism has a military which is equal to the combined might of the next 16 nations .
It spends $ 569 billion a year on its killing machine .
To put this in context the UN estimates it would take $ 20 billion as a stop gap emergency measure to feed the 2 billion starving or malnourished in the world .
Obama uses the second world war as an example of a just war .
Again , this is not the case .
German imperialism was attempting to break out of it restrictions .
The second world war continued the first as a battle for world economic dominance .
Both wars were imperialist disputes .
The President argues that America has been a force for good .
He cites the establishment of the United Nations ( the US was a driving force ) and the Marshall Plan for Europe .
Both were creatures of US imperialism .
The UN of course can do nothing without American say so on the big issues .
The Marshall Plan was about reconstructing Europe as a vassal of the United States .
Even a brief look at America ’s foreign adventures after the second world war removes any doubt the US is a force for good .
Israel , the armed wing of US imperialism in the region , has terrorised the peoples there since its establishment in 1948 .
In 1953 the CIA engineered a coup against the democratically elected Mossadeq Government in Iran .
In 1956 Eisenhower sat back and allowed the Russians to destroy the Hungarian revolution because he , like Stalin , feared the possible outcome – a successful workers ’ revolution .
The criminal blockade of the state capitalist Castro regime in Cuba since 1962 is an act of war which has contributed greatly to the suffering and impoverishment of the nation .
From 1959 till its defeat in 1975 the United States , as part of the ongoing war with Russian imperialism , sent hundreds of thousands of troops to subdue Vietnam .
During that war fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Henry Kissinger , along with Richard Nixon , bombed Cambodia and Laos , killing or dispossessing millions .
In Vietnam alone the Democrat and Republican mass murderers killed possibly 2 million people .
The defeat of US imperialism in Vietnam kept the beast in its lair for a decade .
Then Ronald Reagan sent troops to invade Grenada as a first step in re-asserting US might through military means .
Iraq and Afghanistan are but the latest instalments in a sorry history of invasion and killing in the name of freedom that US imperialism has undertaken .
Obama justifies these military adventures by saying that there has been no third world war .
Actually , that misunderstands much of the period after the second world war .
Until the late 80s , the world witnessed a contest between two major imperialist blocs – the Americans and Russians .
Couple this with restraining knowledge in the respective leaderships that war directly between the two would result in nuclear conflagration and the result is that the direct wars were driven elsewhere .
The two fought proxy wars across the globe to establish and retain their strength and weaken the other .
Today the United States is the sole world power , but it needs to keep any possible challengers at bay .
This means China , whose rates of growth suggest that at least numerically it will have a bigger economy than the US in about about a decade or two .
The paradox for the US is that its own economic growth and maybe survival is dependent on Chinese growth .
So the US is searching for ways to help expand China economically but at the same time contain it militarily .
Afghanistan and Iraq are two aspects of this policy of contradiction .
Obama used his speech to threaten recalcitrants like Iran and Burma , dictatorships which do not bow before US domination .
America ’s troop build up in Columbia , and its support for the new right wing dictatorship in Honduras , show too that is has Venezuela and perhaps Bolivia in its sights .
Obama heads a system that is intrinsically warlike .
One way to stop the terror of Obama ’s imperialism is to build mass war movements across the Western world to force our rulers to back down .
This is especially true in the belly of the beast , the US .
The task is daunting , but as Vietnam shows , the Left has done it before .
We can do it again , especially since the logic of US capitalism will drive it to invade other countries .
The killer will strike again .
The archbishop of Westminster today claimed secularists were " just as dogmatic as the worst religious believer and sometimes more stridently so " .
The Most Rev Vincent Nichols , who is the most senior Catholic in England and Wales , said it was time for believers and non-believers to work together and construct a society in which " reasoned and respectful dialogue " was more common .
He told Radio 4's Sunday programme : " Public life is not a neutral place .
Everybody comes with their set of values and religion has just as much right to be there as anybody else .
" A secularist is just as dogmatic as the worst religious believer and sometime they are more stridently so .
" The archbishop may well have been referring to events of the previous decade , which has been a difficult one for faith communities and their leaders .
Secularist and atheists have become more organised and assertive in their opposition to religious influence in public life .
At times , however , the interaction between believers and non-believers has descended into a shouting match with each side claiming the other is wrong .
Nichols said that genuine dialogue could only happen if the nature and tone of the conversation changed .
" That means getting away from the sound - bites and getting away from the discussion that is always centred around oppositional conflict . "
In the same interview , he also talked about the continuing revelations from the Irish Republic about paedophilia and the collusion among church officials to disguise it .
Nichols said something positive could be drawn from the latest events in Ireland , where four bishops resigned over their failure to deal with allegations in the archdiocese of Dublin .
He said : " The Catholic Church always traditionally understood itself to be a church of sinners , this is very plain .
" Appealing to the good that is done in the church is important but it does n't take this sense of shame away .
" Shame is part of our human condition , when we see that we have to live our shame and guilt in public that can purify faith and , as it were , strip away some of the pomposity that can easily gather round the roles of clerics and others in the church .
" For years Nichols led efforts to tackle clerical sex abuse in England and Wales only to cause outrage last May just before his installation as archbishop of Westminster for saying it took courage for religious orders and clergy to face their past .

Most of you will know what a blog is already , but do you know what good blogs there are , where to host them , what design to use and what options to put on your blog ?
My own experiences after two years of blogging
What exactly is a blog ?
A blog is a kind of online diary for a company or a person , where you regularly post about your life , your passions , business , news or other interests .
It is a way of having your own space in the virtual world .
If your blog becomes popular and you attract a lot of visitors you can earn good money from advertising for other companies or services on your blog .
Some blogs are so popular that people pay a subscription fee to get the posts .
99 % percent of all blogs let anyone sign up for it and it is absolutely free .
As you have probably guessed , you are reading a blog now !
Blog definition , who blogs and why blog ?
“ A blog is a personal diary of thoughts that are channeled into an organized format and made readable on the internet ”
When a company has a blog , there is always someone from the company writing the blog posts .
The company itself does not blog , a person in the company blogs .
Irrespective of whether you read through an amateur blog , a hi- fi movie celebrity blog or even a business news blog , it is clear that to express oneself and to be heard is a cornerstone of human nature .
This is the core feature that flavors the different blogs with content and also makes them so interesting to read .
How do I start a blog – How to have a blog ?
Being inspired by other bloggers could be the right way to start one of your own .
You must first decide whether you want to make a general blog for yourself or create it in a specific perspective , targeting topics like politics , sports , travel , business marketing purposes , etc
1 . A personal blog is one where you combine your emotions , sentiments with certain facts of life .
Facebook would be a good place to host a blog like that .
2 . A general blog deals with a topic in particular like , travel , religion or spirituality , etc .
3 . A moblog is a blog that can be accessed or updated even from a mobile device .
One instance of a moblog is http://chris.pirillo.com/free-credit-report
4. Business blogs are created with a clear intention to make money from them
5 . Podcasts are a cluster of digital media in the audio and video form that are frequently updated with latest episodes .
6. Radioblogs are audio streams that can be listened to online and basically function in the same manner as a normal blog .
Radioblogs are often not broadcasted such as normal radio and can sometimes only be heard on the internet .
A very successful blog can generate as much as 50000USD per year income from advertising .
The trend of blogging is catching up like wild fire but having it as a real job is almost impossible and is restricted to the very few top bloggers .
Here are some links to places that hosts your blog for free :
The word press home page looks like the screen shot that appears here .
You can sign up for free and run your fingers over the keyboard to make an excellent piece of blog that will be displayed on a global front .
The screenshot above shows clearly an example of a facebook blog which also adopts a free sign up procedure .

How to get pictures for your blog ?
One of the biggest problems of having a blog is how and where to get pictures .
A blog with text only is very boring to read .
While you may not know this you are actually lucky , because you are reading this post on a site that will start offering a collection of about 40000 images absolutely free for blog usage .
Until we have the launch , you are free to use the images in the portfolio section in your blog posts .
Make sure to sign up on our blog in the upper right corner so you will be notified when we launch our collection .
Just taking images from the internet and using it on your blog can cause massive legal problems even if you are just a student or private person and can be traced by image copyright software that searches the net for images .
Option for commenting and debate :
When your blog starts getting comments it means you are doing well .
Giving your reader the option to comment gives them a feeling of belonging and you are on your way to creating a small community .
Chronological order of contents :
The latest post on a blog is always on the top and the older posts are either displayed below in categories , archives or other such links .
This makes the process of accessing older blogs very organized .
Getting noticed with your blog .
A great way of bringing all keen readers ’ attention is to add the link of your blog on facebook or other online forums .
Writing in simple terms , easy to understand and good titles is what gets you into the good books of search engines .
RSS AND BLOGGING – ADVANCED READING
RSS is one feature that has made blogging more meticulous , organized and allowed for easier access of information from connected blogs .
The full form of RSS being ‘ rich site summary ’ or ‘ really simple syndication ’ , it allows for contracting information from various sites of your choice and bringing it in a readable format on one RSS reading platform .
The RSS feeds are supported by XML which is a preferred way to store data on a file online .
The XML primarily is a tool that helps to describe information vividly through the use of tags .
This gives scope for bulk data formatting online coming from groups of people who want it the similar way .
The perfect combination of RSS with blogging enables better reading and saves the reader the trouble of accessing various different websites or other blogs to get updated information on the same .
The RSS feeds give readers the opportunity to subscribe for information on those specific websites and all of this can be read together at one place on your own blog itself .
These tools have made the process of blogging and accessing updated information faster and effortless .
This has been useful in the education line , where teachers and educators use the RSS feeds to communicate to pupils at large at a time .
On the whole , if you do n’t blog , you could become obsolete .
Some of the very famous blogs can be surveyed online and this could be a great way to take off on your personal or business blogging project .
You need n’t be surprised if there comes a time when the world will look into this virtual window practically for all kinds of major connections , information and perfect communication so that all other processes in the world we live in are more orderly , falling perfectly in place .
GEEKS may roll their eyes at the news that Namibia is only now getting its first mainframe — a technology that most consider obsolete .
Yet the First National Bank of Namibia , which bought the computer , is at the leading edge of a trend .
Comeback is too strong a word , but mainframes no longer look that outdated .
Until the 1980s mainframes , so called because the processing unit was originally housed in a huge metal frame , ruled supreme in corporate data centres .
Since then , these big , tightly laced bundles of software and hardware have been dethroned by “ distributed systems ” , meaning networks of smaller and cheaper machines , usually not based on proprietary technology .
But many large companies still run crucial applications on the “ big iron ” : there are still about 10,000 in use worldwide .
Withdraw money or buy insurance , and in most cases mainframes are handling the transaction .
Some companies like mainframes because they are reliable , secure and easy to maintain .
But others have no choice .
Banks , for instance , use decades - old applications to manage customer accounts .
Moving these programs to other computers would be expensive and sometimes impossible .
Most firms that can move off the mainframe have already done so , explains Rakesh Kumar of Gartner , a market - research firm .
High “ switching costs ” explain in large part why mainframes are still a good business for IBM .
It is the only big firm left selling them , at prices that start at $ 100,000 but often reach the millions .
Sales of mainframes are said to have brought in about $ 3.5 billion a year , on average , in the past decade .
Although this is only about 3.5 % of the firm 's overall revenue , each dollar spent on hardware pulls in at least as much from sales of software and maintenance contracts .
Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research estimates that 40 % of IBM 's profits are mainframe - related .
To preserve its mainframe business , IBM has regularly modernised its line - up of machines , lowering prices and improving performance .
It has also given cash and computers to hundreds of universities and schools to get them to train replacements for retiring mainframe administrators .
In addition , IBM is trying to get customers to use mainframes for more functions .
For some years it has offered specialised add - on processors at considerably lower prices , to run a greater variety of programs , mostly based on Linux , an open - source operating system .
And last year IBM started bundling mainframes with applications at a discount .
IBM is also trying to attract new customers , particularly in fast - growing emerging markets .
Without mainframes , India 's Housing Development Finance Corporation and the Bank of China in Hong Kong would have a hard time dealing with their explosive growth , says Tom Rosamilia , who heads IBM 's mainframe business .
All these efforts have had a degree of success , although mainframe revenues have been badly hurt by the recession ( see chart , above ) .
About 1,300 firms , a third of IBM 's mainframe customers , have bought add - ons enabling them to use Linux .
But IBM is in legal trouble again , as it was in the 1970s .
It is accused of abusing its mainframe monopoly by refusing to license software that allows other firms to build cheaper clones of its machines .
Regulators in Washington and Brussels are looking into the case .
More worrying to IBM is a run-in with Neon , a software company .
It sells a program that allows computing tasks that usually run on a mainframe 's regular processors to be shifted to the discounted ones meant to run things like Linux .
Predictably , IBM is not happy and is said to have threatened to charge higher licensing fees to customers using Neon 's software .
This , in turn , has led Neon to file a lawsuit against IBM .
Defeat would make a big dent in IBM 's mainframe revenues .
Still , the computer industry seems to be moving IBM 's way .
The mainframe may well find a new home in corporate computing clouds , the pools of data - processing capacity many firms are building .
Many companies are also increasingly interested in buying simpler , more integrated computer systems , even if this means a higher price .
Reacting to this , IBM 's rivals are making bets on mainframe - like products .
On January 13th HP and Microsoft announced a pact to come up with tight packages of hardware and software .

Jan. 18 , 2010  --
Eight in 10 Americans support legalizing marijuana for medical use and nearly half favor decriminalizing the drug more generally , both far higher than a decade ago .
With New Jersey this week poised to become the 14th state to legalize medical marijuana , 81 percent in this national ABC News / Washington Post poll support the idea , up from an already substantial 69 percent in 1997 .
Indeed the main complaint is with restrictions on access , as in the New Jersey law .
Click here for PDF with charts and questionnaire .
Fifty - six percent say that if it's allowed , doctors should be able to prescribe medical marijuana to anyone they think it can help .
New Jersey 's measure , which is more restrictive than most , limits prescriptions to people with severe illnesses .
State health officials can add to the list .
DECRIMINALIZE ? – Apart from medical marijuana , there have been recent efforts to decriminalize marijuana more broadly in some states .
A preliminary vote on one such measure is to be held in the Washington state Legislature this week .
In California organizers say they 've collected enough signatures to hold a statewide referendum on the issue next fall .
And a separate proposal in California to legalize and tax the drug cleared a legislative committee last week .
A Field poll there in April found 56 percent support for the idea , which its backers say would raise $ 1.3 billion a year .
Nationally , this survey finds 46 percent support for legalizing small amounts of marijuana for personal use – the same as it was last spring , and well above its level in past years , for example 39 percent in 2002 and 22 percent in 1997 .
GROUPS – Age is a factor .
Just 23 percent of senior citizens favor legalizing marijuana for personal use ; that jumps to 51 percent of adults under age 65 .
There are political and ideological differences as well :
Thirty percent of conservatives and 32 percent of Republicans favor legalization , compared with 49 percent of independents , 53 percent of Democrats and more than half of moderates and liberals alike ( 53 and 63 percent , respectively ) .
Medical marijuana , for its part , receives majority support across the political and ideological spectrum , from 68 percent of conservatives and 72 percent of Republicans as well as 85 percent of Democrats and independents and about nine in 10 liberals and moderates .
Support slips to 69 percent among seniors , vs. 83 percent among all adults under age 65 .
There are similar divisions on whether medical marijuana should be restricted or made available to anyone a doctor thinks it would help .
Overall , 56 percent , as noted , prefer no restrictions , while 21 percent say it should be limited to terminally ill patients and an additional 21 percent say it should be limited to those with serious but not necessarily terminal illnesses .
Liberals are 23 points more apt than conservatives , and Democrats 20 points more likely than Republicans , to oppose restrictions .
There 's also a difference between the sexes , with men 10 points more likely than women to say the doctor should decide .
But the main difference is whether people think marijuana should be permitted for medical uses in the first place .
Among supporters , 63 percent would rely on the doctor 's discretion .
Among those who oppose medical marijuana , 75 percent say that if it is allowed , it should be limited to seriously or terminally ill patients .
New Jersey passed its medical marijuana law this month and outgoing Gov. Jon Corzine is expected to sign it tomorrow morning , his last day in office .
Medical marijuana first became legal in California in 1996 , followed by Alaska , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington state .
METHODOLOGY – This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone Jan. 12-15 , 2010 , among a random national sample of 1,083 adults , including landline and cell - phone - only respondents , with an oversample of African Americans ( weighted to their correct share of the population ) for a total of 153 black respondents .
Results for the full sample have a 3.5 - point error margin .

The overwhelmingly liberal tilt of university professors has been explained by everything from outright bias to higher I.Q. scores .
Now new research suggests that critics may have been asking the wrong question .
Instead of looking at why most professors are liberal , they should ask why so many liberals  and so few conservatives  want to be professors .
A pair of sociologists think they may have an answer : typecasting .
Conjure up the classic image of a humanities or social sciences professor , the fields where the imbalance is greatest : tweed jacket , pipe , nerdy , longwinded , secular  and liberal .
Even though that may be an outdated stereotype , it influences younger people ’s ideas about what they want to be when they grow up .
Jobs can be typecast in different ways , said Neil Gross and Ethan Fosse , who undertook the study .
For instance , less than 6 percent of nurses today are men .
Discrimination against male candidates may be a factor , but the primary reason for the disparity is that most people consider nursing to be a woman ’s career , Mr. Gross said .
That means not many men aspire to become nurses in the first place  a point made in the recent Lee Daniels film “ Precious : Based on the Novel ‘ Push ’ by Sapphire . ”
When John ( Lenny Kravitz ) asks the 16 - year - old Precious ( Gabourey Sidibe ) and her friends whether they ’ve ever seen a male nurse before , all answer no amid giddy laughter .
Nursing is what sociologists call “ gender typed . ”
Mr. Gross said that “ professors and a number of other fields are politically typed . ”
Journalism , art , fashion , social work and therapy are dominated by liberals ; while law enforcement , farming , dentistry , medicine and the military attract more conservatives .

It is probably the most feared creature in the ocean , immortalised in the 1970s horror movie Jaws .
Now Australian scientists are using pioneering technology to fight the great white shark , electronically tagging 100 of the man-eating predators and alerting swimmers whenever they approach Perth beaches .
In a world first , the West Australian Department of Fisheries is installing 20 satellite receivers along the Perth coastline which will send a signal whenever a tagged shark comes within 500 metres .
A couple of minutes later , an email or SMS will be sent to government departments , scientists , wildlife officials and lifeguards .
The technology is not new , but has never been used for " real - time " tracking of sharks , according to the department 's senior research scientist , Rory McAuley .
He said yesterday that a two - year study would analyse the movements and migration patterns of great whites – or white pointers , as they are also known – along the coast .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
More than 70 sharks have already been tagged , with researchers shooting or stabbing the devices into the creatures ' flanks when they pause to feed on whale carcasses .
The acoustic receivers , which are being installed on the seabed near popular beaches , will all be in place by February .
The news may reassure Perth residents , for whom sharks are an ever - present threat .
Nine years ago , a man was killed by a white pointer in waist - deep water off Cottesloe Beach , one of the city 's favourite coastal haunts .
Since then , there have been a dozen shark attacks in Western Australia , two of them fatal .
Earlier this year , an annual open - water race off Cottesloe was cancelled after a series of shark sightings in the area .
Dr McAuley said he hoped the data amassed during the A$ 400,000 ( £ 224,500 ) study would provide insights into the movements of great whites and improve understanding of the risk of attacks .
While it was primarily a research project , he said , the information – which will be beamed to a satellite by the receivers – would also be used to detect sharks and warn swimmers .
" The information we are hoping to collect will hopefully help us to answer questions such as how long white sharks spend off our beaches , whether they come back , is there a season , do they come back one year after the other ? "
Dr McAuley added : " We have put the receivers out the front of surf lifesaving clubs , because ... if we are able to implement a response , that is where it is most likely to happen . "
The state government already has a Shark Incident Emergency Response Plan , which is implemented when sharks are spotted off beaches .
Since three of the monitoring stations were installed earlier this year , sharks have been detected in Perth waters on four occasions , most recently in September .
Dr McAuley said it was too early to draw useful conclusions about the predators ' habits .
He believes the government - funded study may make locals more relaxed about bathing off the city 's beaches .
" I think the public 's fear of sharks stems largely from a fear of the unknown , " he said , adding that anything that helps clarify the real risk of people encountering sharks at the beach will " hopefully alleviate people 's concerns . "
In the past , the receiver had to be taken to shore for tracking information to be downloaded .
" Technology that delivers real - time notifications of tag detections has n't been used in an operational sense anywhere else in the world , " he added .
The tense stand - off between Israel and its closest Muslim ally , Turkey , began to subside Thursday following Turkey ’s acceptance of Israel ’s second , stronger apology for its treatment of Ankara ’s ambassador to Jerusalem .
But the incident revealed a fundamental shift in the leadership and regional standing of the two countries that is likely to affect relations going forward .
Only a few weeks ago , Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman gathered together Israeli ambassadors from their postings around the world and announced a new style of Israeli diplomacy , says Alon Liel , former director - general of the foreign ministry .
This new “ national pride foreign policy ” was , in his view , a direct precursor to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon ’s condescending behavior toward his Turkish counterpart this week .
“ Already when we heard it , we were quite shocked .
He said Israeli diplomacy is too soft and it has lost its pride .
Many in the community of retired Israeli diplomats feel very ashamed at this , and in particular on what ’s happened over the past week , ” Dr. Liel says .
Earlier this week , Mr. Ayalon had called in Turkey ’s ambassador to complain about a Turkish television drama that depicts Israeli intelligence agents and diplomats as murderous and cruel .
As part of the official talking - to , Ayalon seated Amb .
Oguz Celikkol in a visibly lower chair and did not place a Turkish flag as usual on the table along with the Israeli one – and made a point of noting this to the Israeli television crews filming the meeting .
There were also no smiles or on - camera handshakes , though there were off - camera , leaving the Turkish ambassador feeling manipulated and insulted .
The 'end of the love affair '
Though the details of the spat may seem rather picayune , the backstory surrounding them foretells more potential changes in both Israel and Turkey .
Ayalon ’s behavior , according to many Israeli political pundits , clearly came with sanction from Israel ’s controversial foreign minister .
Mr. Lieberman , the head of Israel Beytainu ( Israel is Our Home ) – a nationalist party whose election platform included a divisive plan to make Israeli Arabs sign a loyalty pledge to maintain their citizenship – began his tenure last year with a rocky start on the world stage .
He had an early run-in with neighboring Egypt , and said he would recuse himself from any involvement in the Israeli - Palestinian peace process launched in Annapolis , Maryland , because he thought it was a waste of time .
But , Liel adds , the source of the latest crisis is not simply Lieberman ’s or Ayalon ’s approach to diplomacy on a world stage where Israel feels itself on the defensive , particularly in the aftermath of the Gaza war that raged at this time last year .
Also changed is how Turkey ’s leaders see their relationship with Israel .
“ What happened between the two countries in the last 13 months , since December 2008 when the [ Gaza ] war began , signals the end of the love affair , and we have had a severe crisis going on that went all through 2009 .
We are deep inside it , it ’s serious , and I am very worried that we do n’t have change in 2010 , we will see further deterioration , ” Liel says .
Why warm ties are cooling
In general , Israel deeply values its relationship with Turkey , its closest Muslim ally .
Turkey was the first Muslim country to recognize Israel in 1949 .
And an underlying sense of friendly relations goes back hundreds of years .
When medieval Catholic Spain expelled its Jews in 1492 after the Inquisition , the Turkish sultan invited Jews to settle throughout the Ottoman Empire .
In recent decades , Turkey ’s secular establishment – particularly its military – sought to upgrade the relationship with Israel for strategic purposes , seeing itself at odds with both Sunni Arab and Shiite Iranian fundamentalism .
But Turkey ’s shifting domestic landscape has brought to power a government whose constituency does not support such close ties with the Jewish state .
From the outbreak of the intifada in 2000 to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza , the past decade was marred with violent events that turned many average Turks against the alliance with Israel .
In addition , the politics of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who came to power in 2002 as head of the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , distinctly differ from his predecessors .
The party , with strong roots in Islam , inherited the strategic alliance between Turkey and Israel – much of it based on cooperation by the countries ’ militaries .
But the new Turkey , snubbed by the European Union and unsatisfied with the dividends of cooperating with the West , has warmed toward countries in the Muslim world that are at odds with Israel and the US .
Tensions have run especially high over Israel ’s military forays against Lebanon ’s Hizbullah in 2006 and the Hamas - run Gaza Strip last year .
Both wars , which involved significant civilian casualties , have produced a public outcry in Turkey .
Erdogan has been one of the Middle East ’s most vocal critics of Israel in both of these wars .
At the same time , Erdogan sees himself as having taken a courageous risk , by working to reopen a channel for negotiations between Syria and Israel .
Unofficial talks between Jerusalem and Damascus , achieved with Turkey ’s help , broke off at the outbreak of the Gaza war last year .
“ That track was an initiative of Erdogan , ” and an apparent disappointment in Israel .
“ What we see now is that his government believes Israel is the side to be blamed for everything , for no progress in the peace process , both in the Israeli - Syrian track , as well as Palestinian , ” Liel says .
Turkey looking east
One of the biggest changes in Israel ’s perception of Turkey ’s friendship has been that its seen as moving closer to having warm relations with Iran .
This , says analyst Shlomo Brom , a retired brigadier - general from the Israeli army , is accompanied by the fact that Turkey ’s military is no longer calling all the shots .
“ Things have changed because there is n’t the same perception , as we once did , that we have common enemies .
Turkey is no longer looking at Iran as their enemy , as they did then .
The Turks are looking at themselves as a bridge between Middle East and the Western world in general , including Israel , ” says Brom , an analyst of regional affairs at Tel Aviv University ’s National Institute for Strategic Studies .
“ The Turkish military is still interested in the relationship with Israel , but the power of the military is much less than it used to be .
So what we ’re seeing is adjustment pains , ” he says .
“ I ’m sure that our minister of defense [ Ehud Barak ] shares the view that the strategic relationship with Israel is of utmost importance , but I ’m not sure the prime minister and other ministers do as well . ”
Mr. Barak , who puts a premium on strengthening the relationship , is due to visit Turkey on Sunday – a point that caused some Israeli pundits to theorize that Lieberman was trying to sabotage Barak ’s trip .
But the trip is still on , and the fact that Turkish officials said Thursday that they would push forward with a deal to receive Israeli drones in March - despite the diplomatic brouhaha – was a sign that the top military minds in both places still place high value on the relationship .
Barak is to meet the Turkish defense and foreign minister , as well as the Turkish military ’s chief of staff .

A new way to unfold the Earth ’s surface produces a new kind of map
Unravelling the world in novel new ways ( Image : J van Wijk / The Cartographic Journal / Maney Publishing )
A new technique for unpeeling the Earth ’s skin and displaying it on a flat surface provides a fresh perspective on geography , making it possible to create maps that string out the continents for easy comparison , or lump together the world ’s oceans into one huge mass of water surrounded by coastlines .
See a gallery of the new maps
“ Myriahedral projection ” was developed by Jack van Wijk , a computer scientist at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands .

“ The basic idea is surprisingly simple , ” says van Wijk .
His algorithms divide the globe ’s surface into small polygons that are unfolded into a flat map , just as a cube can be unfolded into six squares .
Cartographers have tried this trick before ; van Wijk ’s innovation is to up the number of polygons from just a few to thousands .
He has coined the word “ myriahedral ” to describe it , a combination of “ myriad ” with “ polyhedron ” , the name for polygonal 3D shapes .
Warping reality
The mathematical impossibility of flattening the surface of a sphere has long troubled mapmakers .
“ Consider peeling an orange and trying to flatten it out , ” says van Wijk .
“ The surface has to distort or crack . ”
Some solutions distort the size of the continents while roughly preserving their shape – the familiar Mercator projection , for instance , makes Europe and North America disproportionately large compared with Africa .
Others , like the Peters projection , keep landmasses at the correct relative sizes , at the expense of warping their shapes .
An ideal map would combine the best properties of both , but that is only possible by inserting gaps into the Earth ’s surface , resulting in a map with confusing interruptions .
Van
Wijk ’s method makes it possible to direct those cuts in a way that minimises such confusion .
Maps of significance
When generating a map he assigns a “ weighting ” to each edge on the polyhedron to signal its importance , influencing the placement of the cuts or folds .
All the maps are equally accurate , but tweaking the weightings gives dramatically different results .
Assigning more significance to landmass gives a map of all the continents in a line , similar to Buckminster Fuller ’s Dymaxion map .
Making oceans more important than land produces one giant sea surrounded by the world ’s coastlines .
“ Now and then you make an unexpected discovery , ” says van Wijk .
A map that separates land from sea as far as possible , leaving the continents marooned away from a sinuous watery mass , was one such serendipitous result of playing with the algorithm ’s parameters .
Projection means prize
“ His approach was fresh and innovative , ” says Kenneth Field , editor of the British Cartographic Society ’s The Cartographic Journal , which recently gave van Wijk the Henry Johns award , which recognises the best mapmaking research paper each year .
“ He managed to achieve a projection that reduces angular deformation to an absolute minimum and preserves area – not an easy trick , ” adds Field , “ it was a unanimous decision to give him the prize . ”
Van Wijk attributes his success to being somewhat of an outsider .
Cartographers typically seek single formulae that can be used to transform the entire globe , he says , while computer scientists look for algorithms that work in small steps and can be more adaptable .

NASA ’s plans to return astronauts to the moon are dead .
So are the rockets being designed to take them there , if President Obama gets his way .
When the White House releases its budget proposal Monday , there will be no money for the Constellation program that was to return humans to the moon by 2020 .
The Ares I rocket that was to replace the space shuttle to ferry humans to space will be gone , along with money for the Ares V cargo rocket that was to launch the fuel and supplies needed to return to the moon .
There will be no lunar landers , no moon bases .
“ We certainly do n’t need to go back to the moon , ” one administration official said .
Instead , according to White House insiders , agency officials , industry executives and congressional sources familiar with Obama ’s plans , NASA will look at developing a “ heavy - lift ” rocket that one day will take humans and robots to explore beyond low - Earth orbit .
That day will be years away .

The White House will direct NASA to concentrate on Earth - science projects -- principally , researching and monitoring climate change -- and on a new technology research and development program designed to someday enable human exploration of asteroids and the inner solar system .
Everyone interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity , either because they are not authorized to speak for the White House or because they fear for their jobs .
All are familiar with the broad sweep of Obama ’s budget proposal , but none would talk about specific numbers because these are being tightly held by the White House until the release of the budget .
But senior administration officials say the president ’s proposed spending freeze for some federal agencies is not going to apply to the space agency in this budget .
Officials said NASA expected to see some “ modest ” increase in its current $ 18.7 - billion annual budget -- possibly $ 200 million to $ 300 million , but far less than the $ 1 - billion boost agency officials had hoped for .
They also said that the White House planned to extend the life of the International Space Station to at least 2020 .

( CNN ) - Sgt. Stephanie Cole joined Britain's Royal Air Force more than three years ago to fly into battle - and not , as she says , to stay on the ground and " fly a desk . "
Soon , she 'll finally get to do what she signed up for - working on a helicopter crew in dusty and rugged southern Afghanistan , where British , U.S. , other international forces and Afghan soldiers are slugging it out with Taliban militants .
" I 'm looking forward to it , " said Cole , 24 ( on the far left in the photo above ) .
She will be among four female air crew members deployed to a pool of more than 100 pilots and loadmasters beginning New Year 's Day to handle the newly - deployed Merlin helicopters in battle - scarred Helmand province , a haven for insurgents and an illegal drug trade .
The other three are pilots Flight Lt. Michelle Goodman , 32 , the first woman to win Britain 's Distinguished Flying Cross for her actions in Iraq ; Flight Lt. Joanna Watkinson , 29 ; and loadmaster Sgt. Wendy Donald , 31 ( pictured left to right after Cole ) .
Three others are still in training .
Royal Air Force spokeswoman Lesley Woods said their presence in the Afghan war zone reflects a British societal trend :
More women are considering careers in wartime and are realizing " they can play a part in today 's armed forces . "
The four - person Merlin crews will pick up casualties , fly supply missions and use machine guns to fend off Taliban fire .
It is possible all four women will be deployed on one helicopter .
Merlins can haul up to 20 people and they will complement the work of the Chinook , Sea King and Lynx copters .
Earlier this year , the four trained in southern California , where the hot and dusty environment resembled Afghanistan's .
Goodman and Watkinson practiced " evasive flying maneuvers " and Cole and Donald trained on the helicopter 's three 7.62 mm machine guns , the British Defence Ministry said .
What 's it like being females in a male - dominated military ?
The RAF 's Woods supplied their comments from transcripts of interviews .
Their male counterparts , Goodman says , are great sports .
" You do n't really notice any difference , it 's just every day , " Goodman said .
" You always get banter but that 's what you expect .
If I did n't get banter I would think there was something wrong . "
Watkinson agreed , saying she does n't really notice being one of a handful of females on the Merlin force .
" You start your officer training and there 's two or three girls on your flight and you just go through training and get used to the fact that you 're one of very few girls around the place .
The boys are the boys , they always will be , and I get on with them really well , but it is quite nice when you 're flying with some other girls around the place that you can be close friends with . "
Some women who join the military are following their male relatives .
" It was sort of following in the line of the family and it was something I wanted to do as well , " said Donald .
And , Cole said , her father is in the RAF and she has " kind of always grown up around it . "
Goodman says , " It 's a good career " and emphasizes that it's not " widely known that women can come into the military , that they potentially go out to places like Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Watkinson said there will always be doubters who think women can't take on certain tasks because of their gender .
" I 've had a few people tell me that in the past and I 'd like to see them one day and go , ' Hah , told you ! ' "
She too has had relatives in the British armed forces , including her grandmother , a nurse who was " one of first females ever to be awarded a commission in the army .
" There 's a lot of forces history in the family but I do n't think as an only child girl I was ever going to follow down the same thing .
My mum , dad and step - mum are all immensely proud .
All my family are very proud . "
Cole 's female friends think her career is " pretty cool . "
" They 're all struggling in jobs and debts from university .
I know some of my friends think , ' There 's absolutely no way you 'd catch me doing something like that , you 're bonkers , ' but it 's good . "
Watkinson said she " attended an all girls ' school and all of us girls had the school 's full support for whichever career we chose . "
" I have friends who have become lawyers , dentists , doctors and business women - all areas which used to be very male - dominated .
We were taught that we could do whatever we put our minds to , shown each year when a number of ' old girls ' , including myself , return to the school each year for the careers convention .
It 's amazing to see the support we have from the girls there today and their families . "
As for the work , it will be in tough terrain .
Comparing Iraq to Afghanistan , Goodman said , " Obviously the threat is slightly different out there as well and there 's a lot more happening and going on .
And ... the Merlin force has expanded so much over the 18 months we 've got a lot of new guys who are going to be coming out with us who will not have been on operations before . "
Also deployed in the past to Iraq , Watkinson said the skills learned in that war will come in handy in Afghanistan .
But there will be differences .
" The Merlin has operated in Iraq at the height of the threat and will perform equally well in Afghanistan ; with tasking that will be similar , covering trooping , underslung loads , replenishment tasks and casualty evacuation .
The Taliban have had many years of fighting and so are very experienced ; and with the inhospitable , high altitude terrain in Afghanistan , our task will require top notch training and engineering , " she said .
Watkinson noted the unique challenges in Afghanistan for pilots .
" The area of operation is large and predominantly at high altitude .
All engines suffer from reduced efficiency in hot climates and rotor blades , by their nature , have decreased lift at high altitudes , " she said .
" In addition to this , mountain flying on night - vision goggles is a difficult skill to master ; with various wind effects through the mountains and dust clouds at most landing sites .
The combination of these factors means that the operation of the aircraft is a challenge . "
Is the work particularly arduous for a woman ?
" It is a hard job .
I do n't like to say it 's too tough , it 's different , " Donald said .
" I like to put the girls on the same level .
It 's hard but you just get on with it .
The best bit is flying in different places .
We 've been in Iraq for a few years ; Afghanistan coming up , for myself in January , I 'm going out with my flight in January , and that 's going to be something new .
Coming to places like this , doing different training , something new .
You do n't get to do that in an everyday job .
Flying is what I 've always wanted to do so that is definitely the best part for me . "
The aviators expect to shoot , be shot at , and possibly , be shot down or " forced to ditch their aircraft in hostile territory , " Britain 's Defence Ministry said .
But Goodman said their minds will be on their tasks .
" If we thought about the threat continually , we would never be able to do our jobs , " Goodman said .
" Obviously , we always bear it in mind in terms of our actions but when you 're in the middle of a dangerous sortie you just get on with your job . "
Haiti remains a place of profound need , anguish , desperation and danger , with a few glimmers of hope and slowly growing capabilities to receive and distribute the international aid now flowing in .
Sporadic looting , sometimes violent , was met with force by security oficials and ordinary citizens , resulting in a number of further deaths and injuries .
The tenuous security situation has led to at least one temporary evacuation of a medical facility , to protect the care - givers .
Despite the long time since the earthquake , at least five people were pulled from the rubble alive this weekend , including a young girl trapped inside a supermarket who was fortunately surrounded by food , and survived on fruit snacks .

Stephanie Davies may be in her late 30s , but there is something a little ' teenage ' about the way she describes her ex-husband and the father of her child .
When she discusses Simon Oldham , she tends to use a series of acronyms and shorthand .
SXH ( Stupid Ex Husband ) is a favourite , closely followed by BFL ( Big Fat Loser ) .
Other descriptions are more succinct , but can't be repeated in a family newspaper .
Caught in the net : Steph with her now ex-husband Simon and their daughter Stella
There is a surprising reason for her less - than - mature terminology , though .
She confesses that she spent the final months of their marriage perfecting her ' teen speak ' , as she turned online detective to establish if he was being unfaithful .
Suspicious that her husband of seven years was cheating on her , or at least capable of infidelity , she posed as a much younger - and less eloquent - woman on Facebook called Laura Willsham .
Then she asked Simon if he wanted to be her ' friend ' .
What happened next destroyed their marriage .
' I posed as a 21 - year - old blonde bimbo , so I had to have the language to match , ' she explains .
' I 'd write them in text speak , or insert abbreviations .
I 'd even add the odd spelling mistake , just to make it more authentic . '
Well , Simon , 44 , was certainly fooled .
His replies to his newfound Facebook ' friend ' were flirtatious from the off , and culminated incrude sexual suggestions .
At several points he tried to arrange a meeting with his young admirer , clearly expecting a sexual encounter .
Little wonder his jaw fell to the floor when his wife hit him with the news that his internet ' conquest ' was actually her , furiously tapping into her own laptop and raging as she read his suggestive responses .
Today , as the dust settles on their divorce papers , she is still angry .
Their daughter Stella is just 15 months old , and Steph is now a single mother .
' Stella was just a few weeks old when this all really started , ' she says .
' At the height of it all , I was trying to juggle caring for her and finding out exactly what sort of man her father was .
' Not only did I discover that he was the sort of man who would set up sexual liaisons with a complete stranger , I discovered that he had a whole other life that he was keeping from me , ' Stephanie says .
' It was n't about trapping him .
All I wanted to do was find out the truth '
Simon confessed to ' Laura ' that he had a wife but also another girlfriend - one , in fact , he has gone on to marry .
' Isent him a message , as Laura , saying " A wife and a girlfriend ? " and hejust made light of it .
Even that was n't enough for him , obviously , because he was after sex with Laura , too .
' He made that clear - it was all crude , yucky stuff .
I could n't believe this was my husband .
' Thefinal straw came when I arranged to meet him to discuss our marriage .
Iasked him to meet me at 6 pm that night - knowing full well that he hadarranged to meet " Laura " too .
' For me , it was the ultimatetest .
Would he choose me or her - a woman who did n't even exist ?
Well , he did n't hesitate .
He said he could n't see me because he had an" important meeting " that night .
' Yeah , right !
That was the moment I knew our marriage was over for good . '
Ithas long been accepted that modern technological advances are changing the way we conduct real - life relationships .
Steph and Simon ' sexperience shows how dramatic the fallout can be .
Single parent : Steph resents
Simon for treating her and their daughter as disposable
Thecouple 's wedding photograph , taken in 2002 , highlights just what ahandsome couple Simon and Steph Oldham were .
Both gregarious andattractive , they were , says Steph , ' known as the perfect couple ' .
Butthe fact that Simon had been in a long - term relationship before , onlyto walk out on his partner and a daughter from that union , shouldperhaps have made Steph a little less sure about his ability to be theperfect husband .
' It never occurred to me that my daughter and I would be just as disposable , ' she says bitterly .
Steph had worked previously as a nursery nurse , while Simon was a solicitor , but both had tired of their jobs .
Soon after they married - they had met through mutual friends - theybought a hotel together , using Steph 's family experience ( her parentswere in the business ) .
For five years , they lived andworked together , ' quite happily ' .
Steph had always wanted children , butparenthood had n't happened for them .
In 2007 , they turned to IVF and , to their great joy , in the following January Steph fell pregnant .
By May , they decided to leave their home in the Midlands and emigrate to Australia .
' Weloved the idea of the sun and the opportunities there .
The only thingthat had been holding me back before was leaving my family , but mysister moved out , too , and my parents came later , so it really waslife - changing for all of us .
' It meant Simon leaving hisfather and brother , not to mention his daughter , but he was fine withthat .
He seemed as excited as I was to be starting on this newchapter . '
Simon had secured a place at college on a course that would allow him to retrain as a chef .
The couple rented a house in Queensland and in the October , baby Stella was born .
But it seemed that beneath the surface , Simon was becoming increasingly homesick .
' Hewas talking about missing his family and friends , and wondering if we 'dmade a mistake moving , ' Steph says .
' I got increasingly cross .
We 'dmoved for life , and here he was talking about going back after just afew months .
' I was desperate to get him to see sense .
Hehad long college holidays due , and I suggested he use them to go backto Britain , to get it out of his system .
I guess I thought he 'd spend afew weeks , it would rain and he'd soon be on the plane back to us . '
So Simon returned to Leicester , calling and emailing regularly to say how much he missed ' his girls ' .
Internet infidelity :
It was easy for Steph to be -friend and flirt with her husband using a different identity on Facebook ( posed by model )
His absence , and Steph 's frequent logging on to their joint Skypeinternet account to chat to him , led to a horrifying discovery , however - namely evidence of messages between Simon and a woman in Australia .
' I knew he'd met this girl at his college before we went back to visitBritain , but I thought she was just a friend .
But what I read betweenthem made me realise it was more than that .'
WhenSteph confronted Simon over the phone , he confessed that he had beenunfaithful , but insisted it was a ' one - off ' and an ' error of judgment ' , and he begged for her forgiveness .
' He said she was just a friend , but he'd got drunk one night and it had gone further . '
Simon 'sthree - week holiday in the UK became five , six , seven .
He told Stephthat he still ' was n't ready to return to Australia ' .
Then came news that he had taken a job in a bar in Leicester .
The bar had a Facebook site , and when Steph logged on she discovered it had Simon listed as a manager .
' That suggests a proper job rather than some filling - in - for - a - few - weeks position , ' says Steph .
Simon kept saying he was n't ready to come back to me and the baby , but that we would work things out .
' The more I thought about it , the more I wanted to know if anyone in the bar knew he had a wife and child . '
So Laura Willsham was born , and a trap was set , although Steph quibbles with that word .
' Laurawas n't about trapping him .
All I wanted to do , at the start anyway , wasfind out the truth about what he planned to do with his life .
Was hetelling colleagues stuff that he was n't telling me ?'
' It was n't Facebook that tore my marriage apart , it was my husband .
The internet just showed me what he was like '
Ittook only minutes to ' create ' Laura .
Steph uploaded a picture of adistant relative , who was 21 , blonde and pretty , and set up an account .
Over the next few weeks she planned to approach Simon 's colleagues , hoping to discover more about his life .
' My way in was through this girl called , coincidentally , Laura , who worked at the bar .
' Shemanaged the bar 's Facebook site .
I asked if she wanted to be my online " friend " and she said yes .
When I messaged her , I said I 'd been in afew times and liked the place .
She did n't question it , or say " Well , Ido n't remember you " .
' That 's the thing about Facebook .
No one questions anything . '
Over the next weeks , the two Lauras would chat online .
' One day there was the mention of a life party , and I asked if Simon would be there .
And she said , " Why , do you fancy him ? "
' I realised this was my chance and said : " Is he single , then ? " '
To Steph 's horror , the response was not one she had anticipated .
' She told me that Simon had a girlfriend , who was coming over from Australia to join him .
I felt sick .
' Later , I discovered it was his college girlfriend .
Not only was hedenying the existence of his wife and child , but he was actuallybringing the woman he'd been unfaithful with to the UK - all the whiletelling me we would " work things out " .
I was devastated . '
Worse was to come , however , when ' Laura Willsham ' made direct contact with Simon .
' Itwas his birthday .
I sent him a message saying Happy Birthday and hereplied : " Thanks for the birthday greetings - can you remind me wherewe know each other from , as racking my brain , Si . "
' A few flirtatious messages later , and Simon asked : ' Do you ever get to Leicester ?
I need people to distract me for lunch . '
She asked if he was single , only to be told : ' Have gf [ girlfriend ] but distraction does not constitute infidelity . '
Astonishingly , he started to confide in ' Laura ' ( ie his wife ) about the doubts he had about his girlfriend .
WhenLaura asked if he would tell his girlfriend about her , he said : ' Notbeen together long - odd situation as I imported her from Australia .
Not sure if will tell - depends on how lunch goes !'
Inanother email , he confided that his girlfriend - whom Laura assumed wasthe woman he had slept with in Australia - had come to England sixweeks previously , ' but it is not really working and needs to be dealtwith ' .
' The man is unbelievable , ' says Steph .
' It was onebig sordid mess and he did n't even try to show any restraint about it .
He was the one suggesting to Laura that they meet .
' He kept sending crude messages about what he'd like to do to her .
It made me feel sick . '
Steph admits her own messages to Simon as Laura were deliberately seductive , and you could accuse her of blatant entrapment .
' You could , but in real life women do go after married men , ' she argues .
' It 's up to them to say no . '
Having discovered that Simon had n't told his new friends about her , she had to decide what to do about it .
In April 2009 , she and Stella flew to the UK to see Simon , ostensibly to discuss their marriage .
His ' big choice ' - the night when he had to choose between meeting his wife or his fictional internet squeeze - pretty much decided all their fates .
' When he chose her , and lied about having a meeting , I wanted to kill him , ' Steph says .
' I could not believe he would stoop so low .
Not wanting to meet his own wife and the child he had barely seen .
All for the chance of some seedy sex with a bimbo .
It was the final straw . '
Of course , Simon could never meet Laura because she did n't exist .
Twice in their internet ' relationship ' she stood him up .
Then Steph had to decide how to bring matters to a conclusion .
' The original plan was to confront him outside a bar where he was supposed to be meeting Laura .
' I planned to turn up , chat about what he was doing there , hang around , see him being uncomfortable then say " Oh , Laura 's not coming " and walk off .
' In the end , I did n't do that .
I was too upset and I thought : " What is the point ? " I knew by then that it was over .
It came to a head when he made a big thing about renting a flat so we could all be together " as a family " .
' I could n't take it any more and started ranting at him to stop lying .
But I never told him that I was actually Laura .
I did n't tell him that until a few months ago , when it was all well and truly over between us . '
What was his reaction ?
' There was this long silence and you could almost hear the penny dropping .
He was flabbergasted , but what could he say ?
' Eventually , he managed something like : " Well , you got me there , 100 per cent . " '
The pair divorced , bitterly , just after Stella 's first birthday , and eight weeks later Simon married the woman from Australia , the woman he had had an affair with and whom he had described to the fake Laura as ' disposable ' .
So does Steph now have any regrets about the Facebook experiment that brought her life crashing down around her ?
' No , ' she says , without hesitation .
' It was n't Facebook that tore my marriage apart , it was my husband .
The internet just showed me what he was like .
' It 's a pity I had n't discovered it years earlier . '
Al Qaeda ’s Pursuit of Weapons of Mass Destruction
In 1998 , al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden declared that acquiring and using weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) was his Islamic duty — an integral part of his jihad .
Systemically , over the course of decades , he dispatched his top lieutenants to attempt to purchase or develop nuclear and biochemical WMD .
He has never given up the goal ; indeed , in a 2007 video , he repeated his promise to use massive weapons to upend the global status quo , destroy the capitalist hegemony , and help create an Islamic caliphate .
Since the mid-1990s , al Qaeda ’s WMD procurement efforts have been managed at the most senior levels , under rules of strict compartmentalization from lower levels of the organization , and with central control over possible targets and the timing of prospective attacks .
The modus operandi has been top - down — more similar to the 9/11 attacks than to more recent bottom - up efforts , like the attempted bombing of Flight 253 .
For instance , al Qaeda deputy chief Ayman al - Zawahiri personally shepherded the group ’s ultimately unsuccessful efforts to set off an anthrax attack in the United States .
Al Qaeda concentrated its efforts on nuclear devices in the run-up to the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Based on the timing and nature of its WMD - related activity in the 1990s , al Qaeda hoped to use such weapons in the United States during an intensified campaign following the 9/11 attacks .
There is no indication that the fundamental objectives that lie behind its WMD intent have changed over time .
Al Qaeda seems to have failed in its mission to successfully detonate WMD due to its overpowering interest in such big - casualty , big - impression attacks .
The organization has not pursued simpler , cheaper , and easier - to - use technologies , like crude toxins and poisons , with anything like the same fervor .
To be sure , experimentation with and training in such agents was standard fare in al Qaeda ’s camps in Afghanistan before 9/11 .
But bin Laden and his top associates left the initiative to lower - ranking planners and individual cells .
Once , Zawahiri even canceled a planned attack on the New York City subway in lieu of “ something better ” that never materialized .
But just because “ something better ” has never materialized , and just because the threat of WMD terrorism has been used to political ends , does not mean that WMD are not a threat .
This chronology provides the knowable extent of al Qaeda ’s interest in , plans to obtain , and efforts to use the world ’s most deadly weapons .
Timeline
1988 : Osama bin Laden founds al Qaeda .
Other founding members include Jamal al - Fadl , Abu Ayoub al - Iraqi , Ayman al - Zawahiri , and Dr. Fadhl al - Masry .
Winter 1990 – Spring 1991 : Bin Laden and his associates relocate to Khartoum , Sudan .
Feb. 26 , 1993 : A car bomb is detonated under the World Trade Center in New York City .
According to Federal Judge Kevin Duffy , the goal of al Qaeda mastermind Ramzi Youssef was to “ engulf the victims trapped in the North Trade Tower in a cloud of cyanide gas . ”
The explosion incinerates the gas , greatly decreasing the number of casualties .
Five people die .
Late 1993 – early 1994 : Al Qaeda tries to acquire uranium in Sudan to use in a nuclear device .
This is the first evidence of bin Laden ’s plans to purchase nuclear material for an improvised nuclear device .
Evidence of this attempted transaction comes from Fadl , who defected from al Qaeda in 1996 and became a source for the FBI and CIA .
He testifies in court that former Sudanese President Saleh Mobruk attempted to help al Qaeda acquire uranium of South African origin .
Fadl says he heard later that the uranium , which al Qaeda acquired for $ 1.5 million and was tested in Cyprus , was “ genuine . ”
1996 : Zawahiri , leader of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad ( which later merged into al Qaeda ) , is detained and released by the state security service in Russia .
There is unconfirmed speculation that Zawahiri was seeking nuclear weapons or material there .
May 21 , 1996 : Abu Ubeida al - Banshiri , a founder of al Qaeda , dies in a ferry accident on Lake Victoria .
According to testimony from senior al Qaeda officials , he was seeking nuclear material in southern Africa .
May 1996 : Al Qaeda ’s leadership relocates to Afghanistan .
Early 1998 : Zawahiri ’s Egyptian Islamic Jihad ( EIJ ) merges with al Qaeda .
Zawahiri and EIJ bring technological know - how about chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear weapons to the more ideological al Qaeda .
Zawahiri takes control of nuclear and biological weapons development for the whole organization .
Before this time , high - ranking al Qaeda members had held internal discussions about the wisdom and efficacy of pursuing chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear interests .
1998 marked the year when systematic and programmatic efforts began .
Feb. 23 , 1998 : Bin Laden issues a fatwa against the United States , saying , “ The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies — civilians and military — is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it . ”
Aug. 7 , 1998 : Al Qaeda initiates simultaneous suicide truck - bomb attacks at the U.S. embassies in Dar-es - Salaam , Tanzania , and Nairobi , Kenya .
At least 230 civilians , mostly locals , die .
The FBI places bin Laden on its “ 10 most wanted ” list and starts monitoring al Qaeda closely .
Aug. 20 , 1998 : The United States destroys the Al - Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum , Sudan , based on suspicions that the plant might be producing the nerve agent VX for the Sudanese government and al Qaeda .
Dec. 24 , 1998 : Osama bin Laden states in an interview with Time ‘s Rahimullah Yusufzai : “ Acquiring [ WMD ] for the defense of Muslims is a religious duty . ”
1999 - 2001 : Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan conduct basic training courses in chemical , biological , and radiological weapons for hundreds of extremists .
Abu Khabab al - Masri , a chemist and top bomb - maker , and Abu Musab al - Suri ( better known as Setmariam ) , a Spanish citizen born in Syria , conduct the training courses at the Durante and Tarnak farms .
Setmariam is captured in a raid in Pakistan on Nov. 3 , 2005 .
The outspoken proponent of using chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear weapons in attacks against the United States tells authorities that al Qaeda had made a mistake by not utilizing WMD on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Early 1999 : Zawahiri recruits a midlevel Pakistani government biologist with extremist sympathies , Rauf Ahmed , to develop a biological weapons program .
He is provided with a laboratory in Kandahar , Afghanistan .
Early 1999 : The head of Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) , an al Qaeda - associated militant Islamist group based in southwest Asia , introduces an ex-Malaysian Army captain and California Polytechnic State University ( better known as CalPoly ) graduate , Yazid Sufaat , to Zawahiri .
Zawahiri starts a second , independent , parallel program to the al Qaeda Afghanistan program , with Sufaat at the helm .
Neither program knows of the existence of the other ; each reports to Zawahiri independently .
This collaboration between al Qaeda and JI is likely the first instance of Islamist terrorist groups jointly developing WMD .
The Afghanistan program , headed by Ahmed , acquires equipment and sets up labs .
Sufaat , a more trusted JI member , focuses on developing the anthrax pathogen .
He has been described as the “ CEO ” of al Qaeda ’s anthrax program .
1999 - 2001 : Al Qaeda ’s Abdel Aziz al - Masri conducts nuclear - related explosive experiments in the desert .
He is an explosives expert and chemical engineer by training , reportedly self - taught on things nuclear .
January 2001 : Pakistani nuclear scientists with extremist sympathies create the humanitarian nongovernmental organization Umma Tameer e Nau ( UTN ) .
Bashiruddin Mahmood , the former head of Pakistan ’s Khushab plutonium reactor , is its chair ; the former head of Pakistan ’s Inter - services Intelligence directorate , Hamid Gul , is on its board .
Mahmood is later forced into retirement due to concerns about his extremist sympathies and reliability .
He pens controversial books predicting an imminent apocalypse , offering a radical interpretation of the Quran .
June 2001 : Sufaat hosts a meeting of the 9/11 attackers in Kuala Lumpur .
Sufaat provides a false Malaysian address for Zacarias Moussaoui , who was arrested shortly before 9/11 , to help him travel to the United States .
Before Aug. 2001 : UTN ’s Mahmood discreetly offers to construct chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons programs for al Qaeda and the Libyan government .
The United States gathers intelligence on the offers and passes it to the Libyan intelligence service office in London .
The head of the London office later confirms to the United States that Libya will have no dealings with UTN .
August 2001 : Zawahiri personally inspects Ahmed ’s completed laboratory in Kandahar .
He separately meets with Sufaat for a weeklong briefing on the reportedly successful efforts to isolate and produce a lethal strain of anthrax .
Summer 2001 : Mohammed Atta , an organizer and leader of the Sept. 11 attacks , allegedly meets with WMD figures , including al Qaeda ’s Adnan Shukrijumah .
According to the FBI , Shukrijumah cases targets in New York City for possible attacks ; he is later associated with multiple nuclear and “ dirty bomb ” plots .
A person fitting Atta ’s description seeks to apply for a loan to purchase a crop duster in Florida , and is refused .
After 9/11 , the FBI approaches every U.S. crop duster company , searching for links to terrorists .
Summer 2001 : The United States detains Abderraouf Yousef Jdey , who traveled with Moussaoui from Canada into the United States .
Moussaoui is detained with crop duster manuals in his possession ; Jdey has biology textbooks .
They might have been involved in planning a second wave of attacks for immediately after 9/11 .
Sept. 11 , 2001 : Nineteen members of al Qaeda board two passenger planes in the United States , hijacking them and piloting them into the two towers of the World Trade Center in New York .
Nearly 3,000 die .
September 2001 : Al Qaeda breaks camp .
Most senior operatives and their families flee Afghanistan in anticipation of an imminent U.S. invasion .
Oct. 7 , 2001 : The United States launches Operation Enduring Freedom , invading Afghanistan to neutralize and destroy al Qaeda and bin Laden .
Oct. 23 , 2001 : Pakistani intelligence services detain a long list of UTN members and associates , at the request of the U.S. government .
Sometime this month , George Tenet , the director of the CIA , meets with President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan regarding the threat posed by UTN and the evidence that al Qaeda might be building chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons programs .
Musharraf reportedly responds , “ Men in caves ca n’t do that . ”
Still , Musharraf agrees to work with the U.S. government to out and arrest Pakistani scientists cooperating with al Qaeda .
Musharraf and Pakistan ’s intelligence services follow through with the promise .
1990s - 2001 : A nuclear weapons network run by the father of the Pakistan nuclear weapons program , Abdul Qadeer Khan , supplies Iran , North Korea , and Libya with nuclear technologies and know - how .
Nuclear bomb designs are found on the computer of a European supplier working with the Khan network .
Al Qaeda reportedly contacts associates of Khan for assistance with their weapons program .
The Khan network rejects them , for unknown reasons .
Nov. 7 , 2001 : Bin Laden states in an interview with Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir , “ I wish to declare that if America used chemical or nuclear weapons against us , then we may retort with chemical and nuclear weapons .
We have the weapons as a deterrent . ”
In the same interview , Zawahiri states , “ If you have $ 30 million , go to the black market in central Asia , contact any disgruntled Soviet scientist , and a lot of dozens of smart briefcase bombs are available .
They have contacted us , we sent our people to Moscow to Tashkent to other central Asian states , and they negotiated and we purchased some suitcase bombs . ”
Nov. 14 , 2001 : U.S. President George W. Bush meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Crawford , Texas .
Bush presents a briefing on the proliferation threat posed by UTN .
Bush asks Putin if he is certain that all Russian nuclear weapons and materials are secure .
Putin responds that he can only vouch for the safety of nuclear materials since he gained power .
November 2001 : Pakistan arrests Mahmood and many other members of UTN .
Mahmood confesses that he met with bin Laden around a campfire that summer in Pakistan .
He says they discussed how al Qaeda could build a nuclear device .
He drew a very rough sketch of an improvised nuclear device , but advised bin Laden that it would be too hard to develop weapons - usable materials for it .
Bin Laden reportedly said , “ What if I already have them ? ”
November 2001 : A search of UTN’s Kabul office produces documents containing crude chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear - related plans , including hand - written notes in Arabic and Internet - related searches .
December 2001 : Malaysian authorities arrest Sufaat , the JI leader working with al Qaeda on nuclear weapons .
Pakistani authorities arrest Ahmed , his Afghan counterpart , at his home in Islamabad .
Ahmed confesses his involvement in the project and provides substantiating evidence .
January 2002 : U.S. and Egyptian forces capture al Qaeda senior operative Ibn al - Shaykh al Libi .
During interrogation by Egyptians , al Libi claims al Qaeda operatives received chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear weapons training in Baghdad .
He claims several small containers of nuclear material were smuggled into New York City by the Russian mafia .
Al Libi later recants this statement .
March 2002 : Russian special services assassinate Chechen leader Ibn al - Khattab , using poison , the kind of weapon he hoped to use against high - level Russian targets .
March 28 , 2002 : U.S. and Pakistani forces capture al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad , Pakistan .
During interrogation , he reveals a plot by an American associate of al Qaeda , Jose Padilla , to explode a “ dirty bomb ” in the United States .
Padilla is subsequently identified and arrested in Chicago .
Spring 2002 : In Khartoum , Sudan , a CIA officer meets with two senior al Qaeda associates , Mubarak al - Duri and Abu Rida Mohammed Bayazid , in a brokered arrangement .
The CIA officer attempts to determine whether they were involved in al Qaeda ’s nuclear and biological weapons programs .
Bayazid , a founding member of al Qaeda , graduated from the University of Arizona with an advanced degree in physics .
He was directly involved in al Qaeda ’s attempt to purchase uranium in 1993 and 1994 .
Al - Duri , an agronomist , also received his degree at the University of Arizona .
He told the CIA officer , “ Killing millions [ of you ] is justifiable by any means … .
It is your doing .
You made us what we are . ”
Summer 2002 : Al Qaeda leaders in Saudi Arabia begin planning attacks against the royal family and Saudi oil assets .
Nuclear and biological weapons - related references begin to appear in communications between top - level al Qaeda leaders and the Saudi cell .
Summer 2002 : With bin Laden ’s blessing , al Qaeda issues two fatwas to justify an escalation of terrorism .
One authorizes attacks on infidels other than Americans , including the Saudi royal family .
The other justifies the use of WMD .
Al Qaeda - associated extremists start to case Saudi targets , including the city of Ras al - Tanura and facilities belonging to oil giant Aramco .
June 2002 : Extremists under Zarqawi ’s command conduct crude chemical and biological training and experiments in a remote camp , Khurmal , in northeastern Iraq .
The commanders include men who served with Zarqawi at the Herat camp .
Zarqawi has close ties with al Qaeda , but is an independent operator who never swore loyalty ( bayat ) to bin Laden .
July 10 , 2002 : Al Qaeda spokesman Sulayman Abu Ghayth al - Libi , under “ house arrest ” in Iran , says al Qaeda ’s fatwa justifies the use of WMD to kill four million Americans .
August 2002 : CNN runs an exposé on al Qaeda ’s late - 1990s experiments with crude toxins and poisons .
Abu Khabab al - Masri led the gruesome efforts , testing the lethality of cyanide creams , ricin , mustard , sarin , and botulinum .
A tape shows al Qaeda associates gassing dogs to death .
Al - Masri later laments that his students did not take the training to heart by using the toxic weapons in terrorist attacks .
September – December 2002 : Zarqawi associates infiltrate Turkey , Britain , Spain , Italy , France , Sweden , Germany , and other countries .
They begin coordinating and planning ricin and cyanide attacks via a loose association of cells .
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive briefings on the Zarqawi network ’s activities and plans to attack with poisons and toxins .
Over the course of several briefings , U.S. knowledge of the extent of the network grows from a handful of terrorists in one country to dozens of extremists in 30 countries .
Jan. 5 , 2003 : In a bloody raid on a safehouse , Britain arrests seven extremists plotting to use ricin poison on the London Underground .
This represents the first in a wave of arrests of Zarqawi - network terrorists in Britain , continental Europe , and beyond .
The arrests confirm intelligence reports , producing forensic evidence of planning for crude - poison and toxin attacks .
January – March 2003 : Zarqawi - associated operatives are arrested , disrupting ricin and cyanide attacks , in Britain , Spain , Italy , and France .
Feb . 5 , 2003 : U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell gives a speech to the U.N. Security Council , naming the Herat camp leadership , including Zarqawi .
He identifies poison - attack cells across Europe .
February – March 2003 : Zarqawi returns to Baghdad to prepare for an insurgency to meet the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
March 1 , 2003 : 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( KSM ) is captured in Pakistan .
Confronted with the evidence found during the raid , KSM confirms some details of al Qaeda ’s nuclear and biological weapons programs .
He later recants some of his testimony .
March 2003 : Zawahiri calls off an attack that had been planned against the New York City subway system , in lieu of “ something better . ”
Al Qaeda associates from Bahrain had cased the subway system in December 2002 and planned an attack with a homemade cyanogen gas - releasing device called a “ mobtaker . ”
March - May 2003 : Al Qaeda Saudi senior operative Abu Bakr communicates with Iran - based al Qaeda senior members , including the chief of operations .
They plan to purchase three “ Russian nuclear devices . ”
An unidentified Pakistan specialist is enlisted to verify the goods .
May 21 , 2003 : Radical Saudi cleric Nasir al - Fahd writes a fatwa justifying the use of WMD .
Another radical cleric , Ali al - Khudair , endorses it .
May 28 , 2003 : The Saudi intelligence agency makes a series of arrests in a campaign to neutralize al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and eliminate its capacity to mount attacks .
Al - Fahd is arrested .
Cyanide is found in an al Qaeda safehouse in Riyadh .
June 26 , 2003 : An Armenian citizen , Garik Dadayan , is caught with 170 grams of highly enriched uranium on the Georgia - Armenia border .
This is allegedly a sample of a larger cache , due to be sold to an unknown customer , possibly in the Middle East .
Aug. 13 , 2003 : Riduan Isamuddin , the head of JI , is arrested .
He provides confirmation of his role in the anthrax program .
After August 2003 , it is not possible to extend the chronology without excluding considerable information that is sensitive or classified .
Even though the passage of time has enabled more of the story of al Qaeda ’s WMD efforts to be told , much detail remains too sensitive to reveal , even in the years covered by this chronology .
It is not the author ’s intent to reveal information that might frustrate efforts to identify and neutralize al Qaeda ’s ongoing efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction .
Rather , it is his hope that an accurate portrayal of a compact period in the recent past would enable the reader to develop an understanding of the intensity of al Qaeda ’s interest in WMD , as well as an appreciation for the U.S. government ’s response to it .

Type a few words into the search field on Google 's home page and the engine automatically returns a helpful list of popular , similar searches for the words you 've typed in so far -- a convenient way to find the right information .
Enter " Christianity is " and you 'll find results that , while offensive , at least indicate common discussions on the Internet .
Likewise , type " Judaism is " and Google suggests other , potentially offensive searches such as " Judaism is false " and " Judaism is not a race . "
But type " Islam is " into the search engine and Google 's auto - results pane mysteriously vanishes , leading some to conclude that Google , whose mantra is " do n't be evil , " is censoring its search results .
According to Google 's
Web site , the query suggestions that appear as you type are drawn from from searches you 've done ( if you 're logged in ) , searches done by users all over the world , sites in the search index and ads in Google 's network .
The company also explains that " We try to filter out suggestions that include pornographic terms , dirty words , and hate and violence terms .
If you encounter a term that should not be suggested , please let us know by posting in the Google Web Search Help Forum . "
Perhaps the returned results are so inappropriate that all results have simply been turned off , an option some Internet users label ' cowardly . '
After all , search for hot - button items such as " scientology is " or " Muhammad is " and the results are even more offensive .
A Google spokesman explained that the weird absence of results is just a software problem : " This is in fact a bug and we 're working to fix it as quickly as we can . "
But the company would not respond to requests for clarification .
An intriguing corollary : Google offers search suggestions for future tense queries as well .
Ask " Christianity will " and Google suggests " Christianity will end , it will disappear , " and " Christianity will end . "
Ask the same about Islam and Google notes that " Islam will dominate the world " and " Islam will destroy Europe . "
A TERMINUS AD QUEM
By Sheriff Jim R. Schwiesow , Ret .
January 10 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
This nation is riding an ominously prophetic swell that foretells the end of a decade - long precipitous slide to a jumping off point into a crescendo of ever - ascending calamitous events preceding a final plunge into devastation and oblivion .
I continue to receive mail from those who advocate for the salvation of this country via a political route .
Will we ever understand that the afflictions that are upon the nation have their roots in a deep and abiding spiritual sickness ?
The futility of looking to corrupt politicians and fallible men for answers ought to be evident .
Everything the politicians and their bureaucratic minions turn their hands to moves the nation deeper into a morass of fiscal insolvency , non-winnable wars , societal conundrums and moral abasement .
It is truly the devil ’s course that these arrogant cretins follow , and his seeds that they sow .
“ Because I have called , and ye refused : I have stretched out my hand , and no man regarded ; but ye have set at nought all my counsel , and would have none of my reproof : I will laugh at your calamity ; I will mock when your fear cometh … as desolation , and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind : when distress and anguish cometh upon you .
Then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me :
For that they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the Lord : they would have none of my counsel ; they despised all my reproof .
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own devices . ”
- Proverbs 1:24-31
FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE
The elites - a /k / a the Illuminati - the servants of the denizens of the dark world have been for several centuries endeavoring clandestinely to build their satanic one - world order .
These have progressed to a point where they no longer have to work in the shadows to advance their cause .
They have by increments seized ownership of the governments of the world and by proxy they control the peoples of the world .
We now see them flaunt their powers with spit in your eye arrogance .
Because of the previous fierce independence of its people the United States had long been an obstacle to the internationalists ’ world domination aspirations .
By cunning subterfuge our socialist government and its political leaders have steadily acclimated a now submissive people to world citizenship .
The people , once proud and autonomous , have been transmuted to European style dependence and obsequiousness .
They have come to be users and takers rather than givers and enablers .
It has been a long slide and all of it downhill .
In order to accomplish this domestication of Mr. And Mrs. America , that they could be manipulated and controlled , it was necessary to lobotomize them via federal entitlements and handouts .
It was essential that they be dull of mind , devoid of pride , strung - out and addicted to cradle to grave coddling .
What should have been a difficult task was made easy by the selfishness and greediness that was nurtured in the minds and hearts of successive generations until it became the dominant mentality .
Personal industry gave way to indolence , sloth , and dependence and guess what !
We became a nation of slaves subject to the whims of international masters with allegiance to a satanic kingdom .
The process was enabled and accelerated by politicians who lapped up inducements of money and extravagant perks and sold their souls to the internationalists ’ .
The huge donations that they received insulated them from public accountability and enabled their transformation from citizen servants to unaccountable professional politicians .
They are now absolute lackeys and in service to their sinister benefactors .
Once the elites - I use the words internationalist , elite and Illuminati interchangeably as they are all skunks of the same stripe - wrested the control of the government from the people their consolidation of power and absolute control was an easy matter .

Our God is a God of justice ; because
He is a just God these - the devils ’ spawn - who have enslaved the people of this country and of the world will not escape answerability for their evil works .
Their mortal remains will simmer and boil in the coals of the rubble of the final conflagration they will have created , and then they will be resurrected and consigned to a similar fate in the lake of fire .
GANGSTER LAND USA
The people of this nation are now subject to the predations of the most effective and devastating criminal enterprise to ever come upon them , and that criminal entity is their own government .
I am not referring here solely to the federal government , but to state and local governments as well ; together these three comprise a criminal consortium of extraordinary capabilities and devastating effectiveness .
Your government in one form or another and the condemnable bureaucracies thereof have perfected their predations and elevated them to the highest possible level .
They are also masters of a subterfuge that enables them to disguise their crimes as benevolent acts , they are better at this than that old outlaw Jesse James and their weapons are exponentially more affective than his six - guns .
Our national , state and local governments routinely practice the crime of extortion , an act that they have honed to the highest degree of efficacy .
And here is how they do it .
Al Capone would have told you that if you are to be an affective extortionist you must have in place enforcers , in other words the thugs that are enabled to enforce the extortionist ’s demand for what is not rightfully his .
Capone had his thugs and the governments have theirs .
These are always identified as servants of the people and are comprised of , but not limited to , the following : the IRS , the state and local departments of revenue , the state and local licensing agencies , the federal law enforcement agencies , the state police agencies , the municipal police agencies , and yes , the sheriff ’s offices that are governed by statutes rather than a constitution .
The crime bosses of these enforcers are identified as : the United States Congress , the state legislatures , and the city and county boards of control acting as councils , commissioners or supervisors .
The methods they use for the theft of your property and the fruits of your labors are : taxes , fees and licenses , fines and penalties , and outright confiscation without recourse .
None of these are written into the Constitution , but to our persecutors in high places the Constitution is “ just another piece of paper ” .
These willful marauders , who claim to be acting in the best interests of their constituency , pass millions of laws and issue millions of decrees , which have the force of law .
And they are the enablers of a vast bureaucracy the stooges of which set into place millions of administrative rules that also have the force of law .
It is a virtual well - planned minefield that an unwary and hapless public wanders through at their peril .
It is also an ingenious and devious system that snares more victims than a tar baby .
Every conceivable human endeavor requires a license or permit ; every personal and private possession is taxed , enforcement traps are placed and potential victims are monitored by fixed - wing aircraft , helicopter , high - speed cruisers , radar , surveillance cameras , traffic light cameras , satellite and electronic speed detectors implanted in the major throughways .
Quotas are set by the upper echelons of the various bureaucratic agencies to ensure maximum effectiveness .
The take from all of this is enormous , untold billions of dollars are raked in and frittered away by government on all levels .
To add insult to injury when the poor dupes appear in court to answer to infractions , omissions , and oversights they are assessed court costs to fund the salaries , pensions and perks of the judiciary that often times meet or exceed the fines levied .
It is a double dip that would provoke the envy of Old Al himself .
And you thought you were living in a free land !
I am going to receive mail from those who will write , “ I consider it an honor and a privilege to pay taxes . ”
We ought to set up a government fund to allow these to make voluntary donations .
I can think of many charities that make excellent use of donations and waste not a penny , perhaps voluntary givers to the government will free up the taxes of others so that they can afford to contribute more to humanitarian endeavors .
THE GODFATHER
Every crime syndicate must have a godfather and the capos and soldiers to do his bidding .
Our government is no exception .
Ostensibly our government godfather is selected by the votes of the enfranchised citizens , but in reality the elites control the elections by contributing millions to the campaign coffers of their select .
It is an investment that will return to them tenfold the amount of the investment in sweetheart deals , government contracts , and inside information .
Such was the case in regard to our most recent presidential election .
The internationalists poured millions of undocumented dollars , via electronic transfers , into Barry Soroto ’s campaign treasury .
This enabled this Kenyan national interloper who campaigned as Barack Obama to purchase the services and absolute allegiance of that fourth branch of government , the national media .

With rabid intensity our media hounds will expend every effort , bend every rule and totally eschew any semblance of partiality to propagandize the electorate .
Such was the case in their push for Barry Soroto a /k / a Barack Obama .
So convincing were they with their campaign that they actually deified Barry to the point that a disturbingly large idiot segment of the population was equating him with Jesus .
It is heady stuff such adulation , and soon this lanky charlatan of high - pockets came to believe that he was the messiah and said so .
What the media , and those they hoodwinked , received for all of their efforts was a savvy deprived tinhorn dictator whose opinion of himself exceeds by miles his actual worth .
Lest anyone accuse me of partisanship I state emphatically that I am independent and totally disaffected with both political parties .
Had Obama ’s opponent been elected this nation would still have continued down the road to the graveyard of fallen nations .
An alternative route may have been selected , but the results would have been the same .
AND NOW THIS
“ It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God . ” - Hebrews 10:31
Historically God has raised and destroyed seventy - four civilizations .
Before their destruction each of those civilizations had - in God ’s eyes - reached a final limiting point , a Terminus Ad Quem .
It was a point that He would not allow them to go beyond .
God is omniscient and omnipresent ,
He knows the collective thoughts of every person upon
His earth , and He knows the fruits , present and future , of those thoughts .
When every imagination of the thoughts of the hearts of the people of a nation is continually evil
He will not allow the continued existence of that nation , but will bring it down .
This nation has reached that terminal point .
The sins of the people of this nation are atrocious , we are a carnally filthy people and there seems to be no limit to the moral perversion and the impairment of virtue and moral principles in our society .
We flaunt our perversions and filthy practices before the world ; the national media and the entertainment industry glorify sexual deviancy .
They pipe it into our homes and even into our schools .
We are the leading exporter of pornography .
Our industrial prowess fails , but pornography flourishes .
The sacredness of life is neither valued nor protected , euthanasia is encouraged and infanticide is widely accepted .
Fifty - one million innocent lives have been sacrificed to the god of hedonism .
It is a most grievous type of idolatry and analogous to the sacrifice of babies to the god Moloch described in the Old Testament , wooden hearts sacrificing live babies to wooden gods .
We will pay a heavy price for the promotion , encouragement , and the legalization of this scourge on innocent life .
Our people are totally corrupt and our political leaders reflect this venality .
The present administration and congress is the most corrupt in the entire history of the nation .
They are no less than gangsters masquerading as legislators .
Recent polls reflect this degeneracy of character with the approval rating of congress at a mere seventeen percent .
In my estimation even that figure is too high .
Our congress is at the very heart of that criminal enterprise heretofore described .
Obamacare is not about health care improvement and everyone knows it .
It is about power , and control of the people via control of their institutions .
The government now owns , by way of stimulus monies coerced from taxpayers , the auto industry and has firm control of the financial institutions .
The health care industry comprises one - sixth of the economy .
It is the intent of Obama and the Marxists that control the congress to drive the health care industry to its knees that the government can step in and nationalize it to consolidate their iron grip over all commercial enterprise within the nation .
So desperate are these Bolsheviks to mongrelize the nation that they will commit any crime to accomplish their goals .
American taxpayers were soaked for millions that these political outlaws might bribe their fellow outlaws to support this heinous power grab .
Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson ’s despicable act of extortion provides a most glaring example of the immorality and iniquity that afflicts congress at large .
Senator Nelson knowing that his vote was critical to the passage of this felonious piece of garbage was so lacking in integrity that he held even the members of his own party hostage to his extortionate demands .
Making a false and self - serving statement that he was opposed to the bill because of its enabling of taxpayer funding for abortion this unscrupulous hound went to the inner-sanctum of the King Kong of Marxists , Harry Reid , and negotiated the payment of a forty million bribe in the form of Medicaid funding for the State of Nebraska .
Any opposition to the funding of abortion was conveniently forgotten as he announced his intention to now vote in favor of the bill .
His façade withered and disappeared as he cast his vote for a bill that still carried the abortion language , babies be damned .
Ben Nelson believed that he would be a big hero in the eyes of his constituency , but he seriously underestimated the integrity of his fellow Nebraskans .
They believe that saving babies far outweighs the political graft that he garnered by his sinister intrigues .
He is now spending thousands of dollars for TV ads in an attempt to obfuscate his wretched actions .
He could get on his knees and cry crocodile tears and it would n’t save his political hide .
He is a pitiful man .

If you are going to be writing your own programming language you need to spend a lot of time learning the target .
In my case , the target is .NET ’s Common Intermediate Language , also known as IL or CIL .
As per tradition , here is my hello world app written in CIL .
.assembly extern mscorlib {} .assembly Test1 {} . method static void Main ( ) { . entrypoint ldstr “ Hello World ” call void [ mscorlib ] System .
Console :: WriteLine ( string ) ret }
Line 1 says that I need mscorlib , but I do n’t care which version .
If it was important , then I would include some extra information in the brackets .
Line 2 is the name of my assembly .
I think I ’m supposed to put assembly - level attributes in the brackets , but I ’m not certain .
Line 3 starts my first function , or in IL parlance a “ . method ” .
I bet you were expecting to see some sort of class or module , I sure as heck was .
But no , that is not required .
The ECMA documentation clearly says , “ Methods can be defined at the global level ( outside of any type ) ” .
Well now , if that ’s the case why not just go ahead and try it out .
Warning : Languages like VB and C# cannot call free - floating functions .
Ok , so what else do we know about line 3 .
Well it is an entry point function , so either it returns an integer or nothing .
I choose nothing hence the “ void ” keyword .
As for “ static ” , it seems kinda silly .
Turns out the assembler will infer that it is a static method form the context , but since we do n’t want warnings we will go ahead and put that in there .
Line 5 says that this is the entry point for the executable .
For executables you must have one and only one entry point , the assembler wo n’t even try to sort it out if you break that rule .
Line 6 is translated as “ load a string and push it onto the stack ” .
What follows is a QSTRING .
From the spec :
QSTRING is a string surrounded by double quote ( ″ ) marks .
Within the quoted string the character “ \ ” can be
used as an escape character , with “ \t ” representing a tab character , “
” representing a newline character , and
“ \ ” followed by three octal digits representing a byte with that value .
The “ + ” operator can be used to
concatenate string literals .
This way , a long string can be broken across multiple lines by using “ + ” and a new
string on each line .
An alternative is to use “ \ ” as the last character in a line , in which case , that character and
the line break following it are not entered into the generated string .
Any white space characters ( space , line -
feed , carriage - return , and tab ) between the “ \ ” and the first non -white space character on the next line are
ignored .
[ Note :
To include a double quote character in a QSTRING , use an octal escape sequence .
end note ]
You do n’t have to use a QSTRING .
You could instead use a SQSTRING .
I do n’t know why you would though , because literally the only difference is that it is wrapped in single quotes instead of double quotes .
Line 7 is a method call .
( Not a function call ; this is CIL and everything is a method . )
Note that we have to be very explicit about what assembly the method lives in , what type wraps it , and which overload we desire .
Lets take a moment to talk about the stack .
When you want to call a method you need to push the arguments onto the stack .
When the method returns , if it has a non-void return type , the result will be pushed onto the stack .
This means at run time your stacks are going to look something like this :
Before calling WriteLine After calling WriteLine Pointer to “ Hello World ” [ not yours ] [ not yours ]
If you stray into the “ not yours ” part of the stack , say by calling WriteLine twice in a row , then bad things will happen .
The assembler does n’t care about double - checking the stack , so that wo n’t save you .
There is a program called PEVerify that will warn you about potential stack underflows .
If you do n’t use it , then you find your error when your program crashes hard with an InvalidProgramException .
Line 8 is the return statement .
If the function has a return value , it is copied from the top of the current stack to the top of the calling function ’s stack .
Since we are n’t returning anything , the stacks are not affected .
Gun rights activists want to push the limit on where they can carry concealed weapons in Georgia .
House Bill 615 would allow them to carry guns anywhere except in a courtroom or prison .
Republican Representative Tim Bearden is championing the bill .
He told a house committee that people with carry permits must be able to take their guns into churches , bars , schools , colleges , and to the Atlanta 's Hartsfield Jackson International airport , which is currently a gun- free zone .
“ When you say it ’s a gun free zone at the airport and you ca n’t bring one on , you did n’t just make the airport a gun free zone , you made that person defenseless , " he says .
The controversial bill drew quick criticism from Democratic Representative Roberta Abdul Salaam , who said the airport needs special consideration .
" We have a high level of threats right now in this entire country , and for whatever reason our airports seem to be targeted , " she said .
" Would n’t we want to be more cautious at least around an airport ? ”
The bill would affect about 400,000 Georgians who currently hold gun carry permits .
It was assigned to a house subcommittee .
The legislation is backed by the gun rights group Georgia Carry .
The group is angry that Transit Police in Atlanta arrested and searched one of its members who carried a gun on MARTA property .
A federal judge recently agreed with MARTA .
The proposal is backed by the National Rifle Association and should get strong consideration during the upcoming legislative session .
This is an election year for all house members and state senators .

If you 've worked with a Linux long enough , you will have come in contact with the sudo utility .
What is sudo ?
Sudo has been brilliantly described by the XKCD comic here .
What sudo does is allow a user to run commands and applications with the security privileges of another user .
Most often this is used in distributions where the root user has been locked out and then gives the standard user the privileges to do things like install applications or run applications that would normally require administrative rights .
For example :
When you want to restart networking you would normally run the command / etc / init.d / networking restart as the administrative user .
But without being able to log in as the administrative user , you would instead issue that same command like : sudo / etc / initi.d / networking restart .
You would be asked for your users ' password and networking would restart .
But what if , as a system administrator , you add a new user and want to give them similar sudo rights ?
How do you go about doing this ?
Could you just open the /etc / sudoers file in your favorite text editor and make some changes ?
No .
There is another tool that you must use called visudo .
The reason for this is that the visudo command ensures that only one person can edit the /etc / sudoersfile at a time ( in order to avoid any possible security or user - induced overwriting issues ) .
As the name might imply , visudoers will default to the vi editor .
But if you have set up your installation to use a different editor ( such as nano ) , visudoers will default to that .
With that in mind , let 's make some changes !
As you might expect , you can't just issue the visudocommand without using sudo itself .
So to actually open your /etc / sudoers file with visudo you must issue the command ( from within a terminal window ) :
sudo visudo
NOTE : If you have Phil Collin 's song Susudio playing in the background , you will still have to use sudo when using the visudo command .
When you open visudo you will immediately notice it is not an overly huge file ( approximately 25 lines long ) .
You will also notice near the end a section that looks like :
# %sudo ALL=NOPASSWD : ALL
You might be tempted to uncomment this out so you no longer have to type that sudo password .
DO NOT DO THIS or you will compromise the security of your system .
There is a line a few lines above this that looks like :
root ALL=( ALL ) ALL
What you need to do is mimic this line just below it with the new line to include your new user .
This new line will look like :
username ALL=( ALL ) ALL
Where username is the actual username you have added .
Is n't there a GUI ?
Yes , there is .
If you go to the Administration sub - menu of the System menu and select Users and Groups you can unlock this tool ( click the " Keys " button and enter your password ) .
Now select the user you want to modify and click the Properties button .
Figure 1 shows a new user without Administrative ( sudo ) rights .
Click the check box next to Administer the system and then click OK .
This user should now have the same rights as they would have by using the visudo command .
Me ?
I prefer doing things the command - line way , simply because I feel there is more control .
But if you prefer the GUI path , you can have that as well .
Final thoughts
As always , use caution when giving users administrative rights .
If you do n't trust their skills or their motivations , do n't give them the ability to bring down your system .

California 's population grew less than 1 % in the last year , the slowest growth rate in more than a decade as migration to the state barely kept up with the significant number of people leaving , according to state Department of Finance data released today .
Across the state , natural increases rather than migration accounted for the largest source of population growth .
Los Angeles County , for instance , lost more people than it gained through migration but grew slightly to 10.4 million people from July 2008 to July 2009 because births outstripped deaths .
Los Angeles County gained 89,361 people through natural increases ( 147,319 births minus 57,958 deaths ) but lost a net 21,736 people through migration .
Other Southern California counties also recorded slow rates of growth .
Orange county 's population grew to 3.1 million , San Bernardino County to 2 million , Riverside County to 2.1 million and Ventura County to 841,000 .
The state 's largest growth came in Imperial County , where both immigration and natural increases boosted the population by 2.2 % to 181,772 .

Iceland , a morality play
Scavved from John 's comments , ajay 's reconstruction of the whole wossname , with a few additions from Richard J and me .
DRAMATIS PERSONAE
ROLF , an Icelandic banker
LARS , an Icelandic government bloke
TOM , a British government bloke
ELLEN , a British punter
BLOFELD , an IMF bloke
JOHANNA , an Icelandic lady
Act One
ROLF : I would like to open a bank in your country !
TOM : Stop !
Before you do so , will our citizens ’ money be safe in it ?
LARS : Yes it will , my British chum .
We ’ll guarantee the first € 20 k or so of each British customer ’s deposit , as international treaties dictate .
TOM : In that case , crack on .
ROLF : Come on , British people !
Deposit your money in my bank !
ELLEN : All right then .
Here ’s a big bag of cash .
Act Two
ROLF : Oh , by the way , my bank ’s collapsing .
ELLEN : Shit !
What about my money ?
It ’s safe , right ?
ROLF : Yes , sort of , but you ca n’t get it out right now , because the safe door is very stiff , and we have to handle the notes with special gloves , and we ’ve only got one pair and the dog ate one of them …
ELLEN : GIVE ME MY MONEY NOW
TOM : Er , Lars ?
You want to handle this one ?
LARS : Maybe later .
Busy .
ROLF : Lars , baby , you know that fund we ’d been supposed to set up to guarantee our deposits , and you were supposed to make sure was all hunky - dory ?
LARS HASTILY DELVES INTO UNFILED PAPERS ON DESK .
LARS : Oh yes , that one .
ROLF : It ’s kinda broke .
LARS :…
Act Three
ELLEN : WHERE IS MY MONEY YOU MALODOROUS BUNCH OF VIKINGS
LARS : ( to the global public ) Well , we ’re broke .
If you ’re Icelandic , you get your cash back .
Foreigners ?
You can go whistle , mateys
THE MORE ERUDITE MEMBERS OF THE GLOBAL PUBLIC : Hang on , did n’t you sign up to an agreement that implicitly prohibits discrimination on these grounds ?
What gives , dudes ?
TOM : Bloody hell .
OK , here , Ellen , have some of mine to tide you over until either Lars or , more probably , Rolf pays me back .
Which they ’ll do , because they have to .
BLOFELD : Lars , are you OK ?
Need a loan ?
LARS : GIMME
BLOFELD : Sure , but you have to use some of that to pay Tom back after he got you out of trouble with Ellen .
LARS : OK GIMME MONEY
TOM : So , Lars , mate , I sort of need that money now .
LARS : OK , here you are .
Wait !
No !
I ’ve changed my mind !
Act Four
TOM AND BLOFELD : what the fuck do you mean , changed your mind ?
JOHANNA : I ’m very sorry , ignore him , I am in charge .
We deeply regret this wildly predictable screw up but we promise you will get your money back , we just need a bit of time to pay
TOM : Oh , fair enough , that ’s all right then
BLOFELD : If he ’s cool , I ’m cool .
JOHANNA : well , now to work , clearing up all the massive heap of shit that Rolf and Lars appear to have dumped on my desk
LARS : Hang on , I 've had another idea !
Even though I was voted out for causing that " financial collapse " ...
Act Five
LARS : ... I still control a largely honorary position that lets me force a referendum on legislation if I 'm prepared to cause a minor constitutional crisis !
Whahey !
ROLF : Hey Icelanders !
You can vote yourselves EUR40,000 a head at the expense of foreigners !
ICELANDERS : Is it as simple as that ?
We dimly recall a couple of get rich quick schemes from the past that did n't work out as planned .
ROLF : Yes !
Just as simple as that !
Nothing can possibly go wrong !
And the best thing is , you ’ll be taking it from the villainous Brits whose fault this entire crisis was when they maliciously destroyed my bank out of pure jealousy !
LARS : gosh I am glad that I vetoed that law that Johanna tried to pass preventing Rolf from establishing a media monopoly !
FINIS ( so far )
There really , really is no case to be made for the " plucky lickle Icelanders " .
It 's notorious in the Nordic region for being a boastful little country with a selfish streak a mile wide , and when they elected successive governments of neoliberal chancers , they knew what they were doing .
The nearest comparison anywhere in the world is California .

JAL is now valued at less than the price of a new jumbo jet Japan Airlines ( JAL ) , Asia 's biggest air carrier , has filed for bankruptcy protection , in one of the country 's biggest corporate failures .
Some 15,600 jobs are expected to be cut .
All board members have also voted to resign , according to Japanese media .
A state - backed turnaround organisation has said it plans to inject about 300bn yen ( $ 3.3bn ; £ 2 bn ) into JAL .
Japan 's government says flights will continue as normal as the airline begins restructuring .
Its reorganisation will take place under the supervision of the state - backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation ( ETIC ) .
As well as reducing its headcount , JAL will have to replace some of the older , less fuel - efficient planes in its fleet and reduce the number of routes it flies .
ANALYSIS Andrew Walker , economics correspondent , BBC World Service Japan Airlines ' problems partly reflect the carrier 's own difficulty in controlling its costs .
But they are also a reminder of the fact that aviation can be a very difficult industry .
In the US , some of the biggest airlines have been into and emerged from a bankruptcy procedure in recent years , including Delta and United .
So Japan Airlines is joining some big names by going though this process .
Despite its troubles , it is the focus of a contest between two of the leading global airline alliances .
JAL is a member of the One World alliance , which includes American Airlines and British Airways .
But Skyteam , whose members include Delta and Air France , are keen to recruit JAL , to add the routes they can offer to customers .
For all the problems facing many airlines , there is a real advantage in attracting passengers to be able to connect with a very wide range of destinations .
And for that , both alliances have been offering financial help to a bankrupt airline .
JAL will also receive a 600 bn - yen credit line and get 730bn yen in debt waivers .
Shares in JAL have fallen to an all - time low , valuing the firm at just $ 150 m - less than the price of a new jumbo jet .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange said shares in the carrier would be delisted on 20 February .
Along with other major global airlines , JAL has been hit hard by falling passenger numbers during the global economic downturn .
The carrier has debts of $ 25.6 bn .
Investors to lose out " Basically this shows that nothing is too big to fail , that America 's GM and Japan 's JAL were in the same situation , " said Koichi Ogawa from Daiwa SB Investments .
" What this has shown is that the nation wo n't just take total care of a company , that they 've now said they 'll let badly - run companies fail . "
A third of JAL 's workforce face the prospect of losing their jobs , the BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo says .
While the turnaround plan backed by the government will see the airline continue to fly , investors in the company are likely to lose most of their money .
But JAL 's competitors would only see a limited impact from its bankruptcy filing , Kazuyuki Terao , chief investment officer at RCM Japan , said .
STORY SO FAR ...
Founded in 1951 , Japan 's flagship carrier came to symbolise the country 's rapid economic growth , leading to privatisation in 1987 But when Japan 's stock market and property bubble of the 1980s burst , it was hurt by risky investments it had made in foreign resorts and hotels
It also found itself with growing pension and payroll costs , and running many unprofitable domestic routes , which it was politically obliged to maintain More recently , it has seen falling passenger numbers in the global downturn , and as a result of increased competition from Japanese rival All Nippon Airways
It lost 131bn yen ( $ 1.4bn ; £ 880 m ) in the six months to September
JAL woes test government 's resolve " If consumers shift to other carriers , it might have a positive impact but it is also not likely because for consumers , utility is important - which will not change after bankruptcy . "
Support Meanwhile , US carrier Delta Air Lines has issued a statement of support for JAL .
Delta wants JAL to leave the OneWorld Alliance and join its SkyTeam partnership .
" Delta and SkyTeam fully support Japan Airlines and stand ready to provide assistance and support in any way possible .
" Delta fully expects that JAL , with the support of ETIC , will be successful in its restructuring and return the airline to a position of prominence . "

​ A California medical marijuana patient may soon be receiving almost $ 40,000 from the sheriff ’s department for six pounds of unlawfully seized and destroyed cannabis .
Kimberley Marshall , 46 , of Los Osos , Calif. , has filed a claim for damages against Sheriff Patrick Hedges and the county , alleging the county unjustly seized and destroyed the medicinal pot , reports Matt Fountain of
If she prevails , Marshall could be the first medical marijuana patient in San Luis Obispo County to be paid for confiscated cannabis .
Marshall , a survivor of liver cancer and other afflictions , seeks $ 36,000 — $ 6,000 per pound of confiscated marijuana — plus attorney fees and damages , according to the claim , filed Dec. 23 .
Sheriff ’s deputies entered Marshall ’s home on March 31 , 2009 , in a warrantless search involving her son , who was on probation .
During the course of the search , officers discovered Marshall ’s 18 - month supply of marijuana , which she says was locked in a closet in her bedroom .
After being repeatedly told by Marshall ’s son that the marijuana was medicinal , deputies contacted her over the phone , at which time she explained her condition and demanded the marijuana be left at her home .
​ Documentation proving Marshall ’s status as a legal medical marijuana patient was visible to the deputies , according to her claim .
When she returned , she says she found the ignored documents behind some furniture in her bedroom .
Deputies told Marshall her property would be returned once she showed proper paperwork .
When finally interviewed by a deputy four months later , she presented her physician ’s letter of recommendation and told officers further documentation was available from her lawyer .
On September 1 , the district attorney rejected the criminal case against Marshall , based on her medical defense .
That ’s when things got weird .
The very next day , the sheriff ’s department told the D.A. ’s office that the marijuana in the evidence room was “ no longer needed ” — that they had n’t received a request for return of property , nor deemed the marijuana was for medical purposes — and requested the district attorney get a court order for its destruction .
On Oct. 5 , the D.A. filed the request , and four days later , Judge Dodie Harmon ordered the marijuana destroyed .
Unaware of this , Marshall ’s lawyer , Harold Mesick , filed a request for the return of the pot on Oct. 22 and was told by county counsel that it had already been destroyed .
The county also claimed that the sheriff ’s department “ had no record ” of Marshall ’s medical documentation .
According to Marshall ’s new lawyer , Louis Koory , the sheriff ’s department violated his client ’s due process rights and deprived her of the use and value of the property by having the marijuana destroyed .
Koory said there were no pending criminal charges against Marshall , and that her previous lawyer , Mesick , had already established that Marshall was a legal medical marijuana patient .
Sheriff ’s department Rob Bryn showed nothing but contempt for Marshall ’s loss of property and health concerns .
“ Cases like this are brought on by the medical marijuana lobby as a way to garner publicity , ” Bryan sneeringly said .
“ And in this case , the sheriff ’s department is not willing to play along .
The San Louis Obispo County Sheriff ’s Department has earned an unsavory reputation for really hating pot and for trampling the rights of medical marijuana patients .
In 2008 , Sheriff Pat Hedges refused to return a small bag of cannabis to Arroyo Grande resident D. Craig Steffens , even after Steffens proved he had a physician ’s recommendation and criminal charges were dropped .
A judge ordered Sheriff Hedges to return the weed , but Hedges , displaying contempt for the very rule of law he is sworn to uphold , refused until threatened with a contempt - of - fourt order .
Under San Luis Obispo County medical marijuana rules , patients may possess up to eight ounces of pot , unless their physician specifically recommends a larger quantity .
Attorney Koory said Marshall ’s claim is “ in review , ” and the county counsel his six months to either accept or reject it .
Koory predicted the latter , at which time Marshall could choose to file a civil lawsuit against Sheriff Hedges and the county .
Or maybe it will be another enchanting case of sexual abuse and pedophilia in the Catholic Church !
What , too 2001 ?
Fine , how about six decades of child rape and beatings at the hands of countless nuns and priests in Irish Catholic orphanages ?
Oh right , that was last year .
The pope slamming birth control in Africa ?
Megachurch pastors shamelessly fleecing their gullible flock for still more millions ?
Some spectacular combination of the above ?
So many choices !
What 's your pleasure , good reader ?
Of one thing you can be absolutely certain : whenever self - righteous Christians make the news , it 's going to be ... embarrassing .
Sad. Sickening .
Disingenuous .
A little dangerous .
A lot pitiable .
Homophobic ?
Frequently .
Hypocritical ?
Invariably .
Deeply ignorant of the real teachings of the true , mystical , renegade , anti-authority Jesus , who was about as far from the modern Pentecostal evangelical fundamentalist organized - religion worldview as a vegan from a Kansas slaughterhouse ?
You already know the answer .
All of which makes it delightful -- in that nauseatingly familiar sort of way -- to read the story about the Northern California evangelicals whose repulsive views on homosexuality and " curing " gay people reportedly helped shape a new , violently anti-gay bill in Uganda .
Did you see ?
The New York Times piece about how Ugandan officials took the American evangelicals ' beliefs about the best ways to punish / reform " evil " gays to its natural conclusion , and decided , if all other forcible rehab options fail , it would be perfectly appropriate to simply exterminate the homosexuals ?
I mean , why not ?
If it 's certifiably evil , if you can't " cure " it , if it scares the livestock , transmits disease , preys upon young boys and makes the older men fantasize in dangerous and uneasy ways , if God ( not really ) said it was an abomination , what 's the problem ?
Of course , the radical evangelicals in question were -- or at least pretended to be -- horrified at this practical summation of their views , immediately wrote panicky letters to Ugandan officials to correct their unfortunate " misinterpretation , " as damn well they should have .
" No , no , no ! " they sort of said .
" We did n't mean actually kill them .
That would be wrong .
We simply meant gently , lovingly rehabilitate .
You know : drugs , imprisonment , maybe some beatings , public humiliation , brainwashing , genital torture , electroshock therapy like the Mormons used to do .
" Barring that , just do what we do in America : psychological torment in the form of relentless , crushing guilt .
This will make the evil gay feel so suicidally depressed about his perfectly natural desires , his body , his emotions , who he is as a living soul on this planet , he 's bound to come around .
See , like most major religions of the world , we work to shame the sinner so horribly that if he does n't kill himself , you 'll end up with a fine , completely numb soldier of Christ !
But do n't actually kill them .
Heavens ! "
Ugandan officials , apparently a bit confused about just how this crazy evangelical thing works , agreed to re-draft the bill and take out the killing stuff .
" You extremist Christians are so weird , " they seemed to say , rolling their eyes .
It 's a story that folds in nicely with the sad little furor regarding tired ol ' Brit Hume over at Fox News , a slumpy veteran talking head who recently muttered something gently asinine on the air about Tiger Woods , Buddhism and converting Tiger to the land of happy fuzzy Christ .
Indeed ,
Hume suggested during a broadcast that Tiger would do well to renounce his sinful ways , pack up his little Temple O' Buddhism and move to Sweet Home Jesuslandia , home of Ted Haggard , Carrie Prejean and thousands of priests who are no longer allowed to touch children -- where all is safe and redemptive and no one has much sex , and if they do it 's certainly not very much fun and does n't last more than 90 seconds in the dark in the congressional bathroom .
So thoughtful you are , Brit !
So then .
Is the mildly offensive part how Hume tried to convert Tiger on national TV ?
Is it how he obviously does n't understand much about Buddhism and how it pre-dates Christianity by hundreds , if not thousands , of years ?
Or is it how Hume wo n't apologize and is now claiming Christian persecution as a result of being so pseudo - righteous ?
All of the above ?
Does it even matter ?
Of course it does n't .
But I have to admit , ever since Dubya so mercifully slumped off the national stage and hauled his fractured , dejected army of Christian fundamentalists with him , the stories about unfortunate imbecility , sexual misadventure and righteous indignation in the name of Christ have slowed to a mere trickle .
Which is not a bad thing at all , really .
Oh sure , they 're still out there , but the Christian right no longer dominates the national dialogue as it once did .
Now the Jesus crusaders have largely been replaced by an even sillier and more fringe bunch -- birthers and teabaggers and such -- citizens who do n't even have the excuse of a misinterpreted , fear - based faith to back their biases and anxieties .
Now they just have ... Glenn Beck .
No matter .
We can all safely assume millions of good , reasonable Christians were just as disgusted as anyone over the fringe evangelical hatred on display in the Uganda story .
And most would even agree that Hume was a bit of a jackass for daring to " correct " anyone 's faith , especially one of the great , peaceful religions of the world , even on a network as shamelessly right - wing and morally unhinged as Fox News .
In that sense , these two stories point to a broader truth : Never forget to be thankful , humble pilgrim , when you stumble over barbed tales like this , that times have changed , are changing , keep right on changing ... usually for the better .
In other words , as dire or inane as these stories may seem , offer a moment of heaping , divine gratitude that it 's not like it used to be .
And with any luck , it never will be again .
Hell , you can bet even Jesus is grateful for that .

I ’m not a traitor .
I ’m a man with a conscience who did what he did out of a deep belief after much thought and many doubts .
But I knew that I had to do it , that I had no choice … somebody had to do it …
I contributed my share by making public what the public ought to know and they shut my mouth behind the prison walls .
— Mordechai Vanunu
Mordechai Vanunu was released from Ashkelon prison to open air captivity in east Jerusalem on April 21 , 2004 after 18 years - most all in solitary — on April 21 , 2004 .
In 1986 , Mordechai Vanunu was clubbed , drugged , bound and kidnapped from Rome by the Mossad because he told the truth and provided the photographic proof of their clandestine 7 - story underground WMD facility in the Negev .
In the case of Mordechai Vanunu , Americans need to know that the restrictions that have held him captive in Jerusalem come from the Emergency Defense Regulations which were implemented by Britain against Palestinians and Jews after World War II .
After WW II , Attorney Yaccov Shapiro , who later became Israel ’s Minister Of Justice , described the Emergency Defense Regulations as “ unparalleled in any civilized country : there were no such laws in Nazi Germany . ”
During one of my seven trips to Jerusalem since 2005 , I asked Vanunu , “ If the British Mandate has expired why not the British Mandate ’s Emergency Defense Regulations ? ”
Vaunu replied , “ The reason given is security but it is because Israel is not a democracy unless you are a Jew .
This administration tells me I am not allowed to speak to foreigners , the Media , and the world .
But I do because that is how I prove my true humanity to the world .
My freedom of speech trial began January 25 , 2006 for speaking to the media , the same day as the Palestinian elections …
When I decided to expose Israel ’s nuclear weapons I acted out of conscience and to warn the world to prevent a nuclear holocaust . ”
In 1963 , Peres was Israel ’s Deputy Minister of Defense when he met with President Kennedy at the White House .
Kennedy told Peres , “ You know that we follow very closely the discovery of any nuclear development in the region .
This could create a very dangerous situation .
For this reason we monitor your nuclear effort .
What could you tell me about this ? ”
Peres replied , “ I can tell you most clearly that we will not introduce nuclear weapons to the region , and certainly we will not be the first . ”
In 2005 , Vanunu told me , “ President Kennedy tried to stop Israel from building atomic weapons .
In 1963 , he forced Prime Minister Ben Guirion to admit the Dimona was not a textile plant , as the sign outside proclaimed , but a nuclear plant .
The Prime Minister said , ‘ The nuclear reactor is only for peace . ’
Kennedy insisted on an open internal inspection .
He wrote letters demanding that Ben Gurion open up Dimona for inspection .
The French were responsible for the actual building of the Dimona .
The Germans gave the money ; they were feeling guilty for the Holocaust , and tried to pay their way out .
Everything inside was written in French when I was there , almost twenty years ago .
Back then , the Dimona descended seven floors underground .
In 1955 , Perez and Gurion met with the French to agree they would get a nuclear reactor if they fought against Egypt to control the Sinai and Suez Canal .
That was the war of 1956 .
Eisenhower demanded that Israel leave the Sinai , but the reactor plant deal continued on .
When Johnson became president , he made an agreement with Israel that two senators would come every year to inspect .
Before the senators would visit , the Israelis would build a wall to block the underground elevators and stairways .
From 1963 to ’ 69 , the senators came , but they never knew about the wall that hid the rest of the Dimona from them .
Nixon stopped the inspections and agreed to ignore the situation .
As a result , Israel increased production .
In 1986 , there were over two hundred bombs .
Today , they may have enough plutonium for ten bombs a year .
On January 25 , 2006 , after nearly two years of speaking to hundreds of foreigners since his release from prison , Vanunu was convicted by the Jerusalem Magistrates Court of 15 violations of a military order that had prohibited him from talking to non-Israelis and because he attempted to “ leave the state ” by taking a cab from Jerusalem to Bethlehem to attend Christmas Eve mass at the Church of the Nativity in 2004 .
The original indictment included 22 different violations ; Vanunu was charged with 19 and acquitted of four .
He was acquitted of speaking to foreign nationals on the internet and via video and voice chats .
Just prior to the taping of 30 Minutes with Vanunu on March 26 , 2006 , Vanunu told me , “ Many journalists come here to the American Colony , from CNN and NY Times .
They all want to cover my story , but their EDITORS say no…CNN wants to interview me ; but they say they ca n’t do it because they do n’t want problems with the Israeli censor .
BBC is doing the same thing .
Sixty Minutes from the United States from the beginning they wanted to do a program , but because of the censor situation they decide not to do it . ”
On July 2 , 2007 , Israel sentenced Vanunu to six more months in jail for speaking to foreign media in 2004 .
On September 23 , 2008 , the Jerusalem District Court reduced Vanunu ’s sentence to three months , “ In light of ( Vanunu ’s ) ailing health and the absence of claims that his actions put the country ’s security in jeopardy . ”
On June 14 , 2009 , Vanunu told me , “ The Central Commander of the General Army testified in court that it is OK if I speak in public as long as I do not talk about nuclear weapons . ”
Vanunu ’s restrictions will be reviewed again by the Israeli High Court after Dec. 21 , 2009 .
On July 6 , 2009 , the Supreme Court stated , “ pending a review of his conduct , Vanunu will be able to ask for the restrictions to be lifted and be allowed to travel abroad …
The state ’s representative noted that six months may be too short a time period to determine a change in Vanunu ’s behavior and that the state will reconsider the restrictions based not only on Vanunu ’s behavior but a host of other considerations , including the time that had lapsed since he divulged state secrets to the British paper . ”
It will soon be twenty - four years since Vanunu “ divulged state secrets ” and as Vanunu told me : “ All the secrets I had were published in 1989 in an important book , by [ Nuclear Physicist ] Frank Barnaby , The Invisible Bomb : Nuclear Arms Race in the Middle East . ”
Regarding Israeli behavior towards Vanunu , Americans need to know that in 1986 , Israel kidnapped him from Rome but Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states : “ No one shall he subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention ” , including abduction of a person by agents of one state to another state .
Vanunu was charged with and convicted of treason and espionage .
According to Section 99 of the Israeli Penal Code , treason is defined as “ an act calculated to assist ( an enemy ) in time of war … delivering information with the intention that it fall into the hands of the enemy . ”
Section 113 defines aggravated espionage as “ deliver ( ing ) any secret information without being authorized to do so and with intent to impair the security of the state ” and a sub-clause provides for a penalty of seven years for the unauthorized collection , preparation , recording or holding of secret information ; if this is done with intent to impair the security of the state and then , the penalty is increased to 15 years .
Vanunu got 18 years and was also rendered defenseless when the court ruled that his motivations were not ideological and they refused to allow Vanunu ’s own statements regarding his intentions to be considered in his defense .
A few days before Vanunu was lured from London to Rome , where he was clubbed , drugged and kidnapped by the Mossad , he spent three days being interviewed by Frank Barnaby .
Barnaby had been employed by the London Sunday Times to review the 57 photos Vanunu had obtained at various restricted locations in the Dimona and he also went to Jerusalem to provide expert testimony at Vanunu ’s closed door trial .
Barnaby testified , “ I found the fact that Vanunu was able to smuggle a camera and films into and out of Dimona and photograph highly sensitive areas in the establishment astonishing .
I very vigorously cross-examined Vanunu , relentlessly asking the same questions in a number of different ways and at different times …
I found Vanunu very straightforward about his motives for violating Israel ’s secrecy laws ; he explained to me that he believed that both the Israeli and the world public had the right to know about the information he passed on .
He seemed to me to be acting ideologically .
“ Israel ’s political leaders have , he said , consistently lied about Israel ’s nuclear - weapons programme and he found this unacceptable in a democracy .
The knowledge that Vanunu had about Isreal ’s nuclear weapons , about the operations at Dimona , and about security at Dimona could not be of any use to anyone today .
He left Dimona in October 1985 and the design of today ’s Israeli nuclear weapons will have been considerably changed since then …
Modern nuclear weapons bear little relationship to those of the mid-1980 . ”
A total of 1,200 pages of transcript of that closed door trial have been released and Vanunu told the court : “ I wanted to confirm what everyone knew , I did n’t want Israel to go on denying that it had nuclear weapons , and Shimon Peres to go on lying to ( then US president ) Ronald Reagan , saying that we did n’t have a nuclear arsenal .
I also wanted controls to be placed on these weapons . ”
Defense witness and the Sunday Times journalist who broke Vanunu ’s story , Peter Hounam , stated , “ It is clear that , as far as Vanunu ’s accusers are concerned , the trial is not only about whether this decision to reveal the secrets of Israel ’s atom bomb amounted to treason and espionage , it is also about whether his decision to become a Christian was at the root of his alleged treachery ” .
Hounam also testified that “ We did not pay him money , but only covered his expenses …
Money did not motivate him . ”
Sunday Times journalist Wendy Robbins wrote , “ Mordechai never asked for nor received a single penny for his information … he blurted out the whole tale without first setting out any financial preconditions .
Mordechai got nothing out of the whole episode .
He never ‘ sold ’ Israel ’s secrets — he told them . ”
In the 80’s , Vanunu was transported to and from his closed door trial in a crash helmet , handcuffs and leg- irons , inside a van with blacked out windows that blasted noise to assure Vanunu would not communicate with journalists or supporters .
During the court hearings , two Israeli security agents flanked him at all times in order to be able to cover his mouth if he began to reveal anything they deemed secret .
The public , the press and all observers — even Amnesty International — were excluded from the hearings and the court ’s judgment was censored before publication .
On January 25 , 2006 , the first day of a freedom of speech trial in Israel only two reporters from minor media showed up for Vanunu ’s historic court case .
Not one was in the court room on February 22 , 2006 , when it was revealed that Israel had gotten Microsoft to hand over all the details of Vanunu ’s Hotmail account before a court order had been obtained by alluding that he was being charged for espionage .
Vanunu wrote , “ Microsoft obeyed the orders and gave them all the details … three months before I was arrested and my computers were confiscated … it is strange to ask Microsoft to give this information before obtaining the court order to listen to my private conversations .
It means they wanted to go through my emails in secret , or maybe , with the help of the secret services , the Shaback , Mossad … Sfard [ Vanunu ’s attorney ] proved that the police had misled the judges who gave the orders to arrest me : to search my room , to go through my email , to confiscate my computers and that they misled Microsoft to believe they are helping in a case of espionage .
The State came to the court with two special secret Government orders ; Hisaion [ documents or information that are deemed confidential by the government and kept from the court , the defendant , and lawyers . ]
This allows the prosecution to keep documents related to my court hearing secret .
One was from the Minister for Interior Security and one from the Minister of Defense . ”
Americans need to know that Vanunu ’s secretly taped police interrogations , his 2004 Christmas Eve arrest for “ attempting to leave the country ” when he attempted to celebrate his first Christmas out of prison at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the confiscation of his private property by thirty Israeli Forces that stormed into his room at St. George ’s Cathedral in 2004 , according to Vanunu had all “ been done … under the false and misleading statements to the courts of ‘ suspicion of espionage ’ , and yet they are not charging me with spy crimes … and the fact is that I have not committed any crimes . ”
After Vanunu next faces the Israeli Supreme Court , the world will know more about Israeli democracy and justice .
Until then , learn more and see and hear Vanunu in 2005 , 2006 , 2008 video interviews freely streaming at the Vanunu Archives .
From 2003 - 2006 , Java lost approximately 2,500 hectares a year ( 10,000 hectares of forest in total ) according to the Forestry Ministry .
Despite the rate of loss being far lower in Java than other Indonesian islands ( such as Borneo , Sumatra , and Sulawesi ) , Java is particularly threatened because there is so little forest left .
If the past rate of deforestation occurs from 2007 - 2010 then by the end of the year conservation organization Pro Fauna predicts only 10,000 hectares of rainforest will remain on the island , leaving a number of unique and endangered species in deep trouble .
In addition ProFauna campaign officer Radius Nursidi warns that the actual rate is probably higher than the official data reflects .

Java is home to a number of species that survive no - where else , including the Critically Endangered Javan rhino with a populated estimated at 40 - 60 individuals ; the Endangered Javan Hawk - Eagle ; the Endangered Javan gibbon ; the Vulnerable Javan langur ; the Endangered Javan slow loris ; and the Endangered surili , a species of monkey .
The island has already lost one of its flagship species to deforestation and poaching : the Javan tiger likely vanished entirely in the 1980s .
Poaching remains rife in Java , according to Pro Fauna , even in national parks , such as the R. Soerjo Grand Forest Park in Pasuruan and Merubetiri National Park in Banyuwangi .
Illegal logging is also a problem at these conservation areas .
Currently , there are no security posts at the exit areas of these parks , allowing poachers to easily escape with their quarry .
“ [ The ] Indonesian government should take practical and political actions to save the remaining forests and wildlife in Java Island .
The authorities should set up security posts in the exit points of the nature conservation areas , ” said Nursidi in a press release .
Indonesia has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world .
Largely due to this fact it is also third in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , after China and the United States .
Much of the deforestation is due to oil palm plantations , as well as paper and other wood products in some areas .

Changing drivers of deforestation provide new opportunities for conservation
( 12/09/2009 ) Tropical deforestation claimed roughly 13 million hectares of forest per year during the first half of this decade , about the same rate of loss as the 1990s .
But while the overall numbers have remained relatively constant , they mask a transition of great significance : a shift from poverty - driven to industry - driven deforestation and geographic consolidation of where deforestation occurs .
These changes have important implications for efforts to protect the world ’s remaining tropical forests in that environmental lobby groups now have identifiable targets that may be more responsive to pressure on environmental concerns than tens of millions of impoverished rural farmers .
In other words , activists have more leverage than ever to impact corporate behavior as it relates to deforestation .

That ’ll Show ‘Em
In Monday ’s commentary , I argued that the inability of the American “ authorities ” to thwart the underwear bomber ’s attack resulted from their inability to cope with the volume of information they already possessed , and that increasing the sweep of surveillance would just lead to even worse paralysis .
The problem for the surveillance state , as Holman Jenkins points out at the Wall Street Journal ( hey , even a stopped clock ’s right twice a day ) , is the very low volume of competent and sufficiently motivated terrorists relative to their potential recruiting pool .
From Al Qaeda ’s perspective , the problem is the high transaction costs of getting a sufficiently motivated extremist who ’s also halfway competent , training him for the job , and getting him in the right place , compared to the wealth of high - value - added targets .
“ If 19 terrorists ( the number who carried out the 9/11 attacks ) each blew himself up at one - or two - week intervals in a shopping mall or a movie theater , America likely would become a seething nation of paranoid shut-ins .
That it has n’t happened tells you something :
Al Qaeda does n’t have a ready supply of competent suicide bombers , domestic or imported , to carry off serious attacks . ”
Equally significant is their choice of targets , Jenkins argues , given limited means .
“ So what if their hapless messengers only embarrass themselves and burn their legs ?
Al Qaeda can still count on the sizeable damage we will inflict on ourselves through an airport security apparatus that specializes in expensive political displays of barn - door closing that seldom have any real security payoff . ”
They know how to play the U.S. national security state like a violin .
In an earlier commentary , “ Do You Have a Form 27B / 6 ? ” , I discussed the tendency of the U.S. government toward bureaucratic paralysis , even in arenas like Fourth Generation War where victory hinges on agility .
Rather than taking advantage of networked communications technology to compete with Al Qaeda and the Taliban in decentralized decision - making by on - the - ground operatives , the U.S. military uses such technologies to increase the level of supervision of its people on the ground .
The same holds true in domestic counter - terrorism efforts .
Given the limited number of terrorist volunteers , the Christmas bombing attempt was brilliant — especially brilliant , because a failure was almost as productive from Al Qaeda ’s standpoint as a success would have been .
As Matt Yglesias has argued , every Al Qaeda attack via the civil aviation system — even the failed ones — leads to new security measures that imposed additional real costs on air travel and the sectors of the American economy dependent on it .
Richard Reed tried to smuggle a bomb in his shoe , and everyone now has to take their shoes off before boarding .
Someone was rumored to be planning an attack with liquid explosives , so now everyone ’s searched for shampoo bottles .
If Al Qaeda were really smart , they ’d have somebody smuggle a bomb in their rectum ; the resulting TSA policy of rectal searches for everybody would shut down the entire airline industry and throw the U.S. the rest of the way into a Great Depression .
Every time the U.S. national security state reacts to another terrorist incident , you can almost hear Bin Laden and his cronies giggling in a cave somewhere : “ Look !
They ’re doing it !
The stupid schmucks are doing it !
Hee hee hee ! ”
The irony of it , as many libertarian commentators have gleefully observed , is that the TSA “ authorities ” have once again adopted measures that make the system even less effective in preventing attacks .
As I argued earlier , the main way to make American counter - insurgency efforts in Afghanistan more effective would be increased autonomy and discretion by those directly engaged on the ground .
The U.S. military responds , instead , by using new high - tech communications technology to impose new controls on them and further restrict their autonomy .
Similarly , the main thing that thwarted the Christmas underwear bomber was the agility and independent discretion of the passengers directly engaged “ on the ground ” ( sorry ) .
As Yglesias has argued elsewhere , “ the key point about identifying al - Qaeda operatives is that there are extremely few al - Qaeda operatives so ( by Bayes ’ theorem ) any method you employ of identifying al - Qaeda operatives is going to mostly reveal false positives . ”
So ( this is me talking ) when your system for anticipating attacks upstream is virtually worthless , the “ last mile ” becomes monumentally important : having people downstream capable of recognizing and thwarting the attempt , and with the freedom to use their own discretion in stopping it , when it is actually made .
So what has the TSA done ?
It has further limited the autonomy and discretion of the passengers , and made it even less likely that they ’ll be able to stop a future attempt at onboard terrorism .
The underwear bomber was stopped by passengers who took the initiative to jump out of their seats and take the guy down .
And as soon as the plane landed and the TSA ’s gun-toting goons started their “ incident review ” process , they held the passengers prisoner and treated them as criminals — guilty until proven innocent .
The passengers and pilots — the heroes who prevented a disaster — were forced to sit down for hours , denied permission to use the bathroom , while being relentlessly grilled by “ the authorities . ”
THAT ought to show Al Qaeda — if they ever stop laughing .
As one of the greatest sources of good times in all of history , it ’s no surprise that beer is also the inspiration for some of the best commercials on television .
While there are literally thousands of gut - busting beer ads to choose from , we ’ve compiled a list of the top 16 contenders – enjoy this list of some of the great , funny and amazing beer commercials in existence !
Any thoughts on a funny beer of the month club commercials we could produce ?
1 – The Walk - In Fridge
Originally schemed for their Dutch market , Heineken eventually aired this very funny ad in the U.S. with great success .
Above all , it ’s a comical commentary on the battle of the sexes and the blaring differences between our priorities .
2 – Beaver , Attack !
Brought to you by Molson and their I. Am. Canadian .
campaign , this is a pretty funny example of what can go wrong when you choose to heckle a beer drinking Canadian and their ferocious Beaver friend .
Beaver , attack !
3 – Do You Smell BBQ ?
Of course , you ca n’t create any kind of “ funny list ” without the inclusion of at least one fart joke in the mix .
Well , leave it to Bud Light to bring us a funny beer commercial and a classic fart joke , all in one .
Well done .
4 – Creepy Foot Doctor
Red Stripe does n’t do a lot of advertisting , however , this commercial suggests that they ’re about quality over quantity .
Definitely the most creepy commercial of the bunch , we can all agree with the punch line : Booo creepy foot doctor , hooray beer !
5 – Arm Wrestling
Once again , a clever play on the battle of the sexes .
Like two beasts facing off in nature , these two foes puff their chests and shape - shift into bigger badder things in an attempt to claim the last bear – that is , until the danty female ultimately prevails .
6 – Clothing Drive
A very clever commercial that promotes Bud Light and a good cause , the Bud Light Clothing Drive commercial just keeps getting funnier as it goes and shows how awkward it can be when you ’re the only non-drinker in the room .
7 – Whassup ?
Let ’s get started off on the right foot .
Originally aired during a Monday Night Football game in late 1999 , the Whassup ?
campaign for Budweiser was so wildly successful that it quickly became a pop-culture catch phrase .
You could n’t go anywhere without hearing Whassup ?
8 – The Swear Jar
We ’re not sure if this cunningly crude commercial ever actually made it onto the airwaves but it ’s definitely worth a mention on this list – another comically edgy commercial by the folks at Bud Light .
9 – Bluetooth Blunder
Reason 7,001 why Bluetooth headsets should n’t be worn in public , this Keystone Light commercial hits close to home .
Of course , it may not be to the awkward extent of this ad but who ca n’t relate to this very unsmooth moment ?
10 – Play Ball
Right next to fart jokes on the recipe for Easy Humor is the all - too - classic and ever - painful groin shot .
Well , this would - be Super Bowl ad for Rolling Rock features so many groin shots that it was banned from ever being aired !
11 – Skinny Dipping
Truth be told , this rarely seen Bud Light commercial was eventually banned from television but , considering the peep show provided to some of the cast of characters , maybe they ’d seen enough for us all .
Talk about awkward !
12 – Real Men of Genius
As the clear leader in beer - based comedy , it ’s physically impossible to pick the funniest Bud Light commercial , however , the Real Men of Genius campaign is pretty tops .
While we ’ll feature a few more Bud Light commercials from across the years , feel free to learn a thing or two from these Real Men of Genius .
13 – Miller Light Aluminum Pint
Another commercial leveraging the battle of the sexes , this Miller Light commercial , in promotion of their new aluminum pint bottle , empathizes with men everywhere as it places them in a most familiar jam – the moment when a woman asks you a question and you need to choose your words very carefully .
Ditto !
14 – Voodoo Beer
Brought to you by a Brazilian beer company , Brahma , this very funny beer commercial has the female character and her voodoo doll winning the battle until the male finishes the war , once and for all .
Once again , it is physically impossible to take such a wide field and narrow it down into such small list but we hope you enjoyed our attempt to highlight at least some of the best beer commercials of all time .
Goel Ratzon has denied all the allegations Israeli police say they have arrested the leader of an alleged polygamist cult and accused him of enslavement , rape and incest .
Goel Ratzon is believed to have been living in Tel Aviv with 17 women with whom he had up to 40 children .
Police launched an undercover investigation in June 2009 after complaints from some of the women .
Mr Ratzon , aged 60 , denies the allegations , saying the women were with him voluntarily .
He was detained on Tuesday , but a gagging order on reporting the case was only lifted two days later .
On Friday , Tel Aviv 's court rejected Mr Ratzon 's appeal over the 12 - day extension to being remanded in custody .
He has not yet been charged .
Mr Ratzon 's lawyer , Shlomzion Gabai , told the Associated Press that " he may be different , but he 's not a criminal " .
' Messiah ' Police said in a statement : " The evidence shows the suspect controlled his women with a firm hand , including their possessions and their money . "
It said Mr Ratzon had written a " rule book " for women who he had kept in " conditions of slavery " .

" He would dictate what they could and could not do , limit their movements and impose sanctions and various punishments , including the use of violence if they refused to obey , " the statement added .
The grey - bearded self - proclaimed healer is said to have asked them to live by the rules , which also included fines .
The women and children were kept in cramped apartments in several locations in the south of Tel Aviv , police say .
They say that in one case , police raided a three - bedroom apartment where 10 women and 17 children were found in a " terrible state " living in " horrible conditions " .
The women are now being questioned by police , and the children have been placed in temporary care .
Women and children were allegedly held at locations in Tel Aviv One of the women was quoted by Israel 's Haaretz newspaper as saying that the arrest had been motivated by revenge and hostility toward the sect 's way of life .
Several of the women also featured in a documentary on Israeli television last year .
" He is the messiah everyone is talking about , " one of them said .
" He is already here and has n't been revealed yet .
The day he decides to reveal himself , the land will shake . "
Mr Ratzon , whose first name means " saviour " in Hebrew , said in the documentary : " I 'm perfect .

In the early part of the noughties , Rev Jerry Falwell declared on national television that the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US were the result of " throwing God out of the public square , out of the schools .
The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked . "
" We have sinned against Almighty God , at the highest level of our government , we 've stuck our finger in your eye , " agreed Pat Robertson , who was hosting Falwell on his 700 Club programme .
The mockery of the hellfire - breathing duo was swift and unrelenting .
Robertson and Falwell , brand names of the religious right , had become embarrassments to evangelicalism .
They had outlived their usefulness , and were too old , musty , and unabashedly nutty for the new evangelical cool .
As their stars were fading , evangelicalism 's emerging celebrities were employing savvy public relations specialists and rebranding themselves as your best friend , your entertainer , or your shrink – not the mouthpiece for a vengeful God .
By the time Falwell died suddenly in 2007 , a " new " kind of evangelical had seized the virtual pulpit of America 's attention .
The re-branding was the product of evangelicalism 's survival instinct in the face of the parody - ready Falwell prototype .
One of America 's leading evangelicals is now Rick Warren , whose mega - bestseller , The Purpose - Driven Life ( 2002 ) , begins : " This is more than a book ; it is a guide to a 40 - day spiritual journey that will enable you to discover the answer to life 's most important question :
What on earth am I here for ? "
The new evangelicals write books not about how God will smite you , but how God loves you and wants nothing more than your greatest personal , spiritual , and material fulfillment .
The middle of the decade saw the publication of televangelist Joel Osteen 's Your Best Life Now : 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential ( 2004 ) and TD Jakes ' Reposition Yourself : Living Life Without Limits ( 2007 ) .
Joyce Meyer 's Seven Things That Steal Your Joy : Overcoming the Obstacles to Your Happiness ( 2004 ) and Approval Addiction : Overcoming Your Need to Please Everyone ( 2005 ) are equally at home at Bible study and coffee klatch , in the church bookstore and at Wal - Mart .
Even with the makeover , though , evangelicalism is n't all smiles and gratification .
Warren recently gave in to pressure to denounce a proposed bill in Uganda that would make homosexuality punishable by death in certain circumstances ; while condemning the notion of criminalising gay people he still maintained homosexuality was unbiblical .
( The new evangelicals hope to " cure " homosexuals rather than consigning them to hell . )
He still considers abortion a " Holocaust , " even as he says he does n't take sides in political debates .
The new evangelicalism presents itself as being about a different kind of politics ; unlike Falwell and Robertson , the new evangelicals operate in the realm of hearts and minds , not political precincts .
As the decade closed , though , a group of prominent evangelicals partnered with Catholics in signing the Manhattan Declaration , which promised civil disobedience of laws that supposedly violated their religious freedom by granting rights to gay people or reproductive freedom to women .
A call to revival of the culture wars , the declaration highlights how the evangelical rebranding has n't stuck : as much as the movement tries to present itself as a path to personal fulfillment , it still aims to be a means of political dominance .

Wall Street Vampires : Lately , a lot of Americans , myself included , have used the blood - sucking freaks as a metaphor to describe the Wall Street billionaires who rule us , and who are ruining us .
Like so many awful stories of the past few years , it turns out that these Wall Street vampire - billionaires really exist , literally .
Like all vampires , they live in remote castles , and feed themselves by luring poor , desperate humans into their dens , hooking them into blood - pumping machines , and sucking out their plasma for mind - boggling profits .
Cerberus Capital , one of Wall Street ’s most notoriously ruthless leveraged - buyout firms ( or “ private equity firms ” in PC - speak ) , recently made a $ 1.8 billion killing on their human plasma investment , a company called Talecris , which they bought for a mere $ 82.5 million just four years earlier .
Meaning Cerberus made 23 times their investment on human plasma .
They did it by the most savage , heartless means possible : by paying peanuts to their impoverished human plasma donors , who increasingly come from Mexican border towns to blood - pumping stations set up on the American side , jacking up the price of plasma by restricting supply ( a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission accused Cerberus Plasma Holdings of “ operat[ing ] as an oligopoly ” ) , and then selling the refined products to the most desperately ill , patients suffering from hemophilia , severe burns , multiple sclerosis , and autoimmune deficiencies .
The products cost so much — one , IVIG ( intravenous immunoglobulin ) cost twice the price of gold as of last summer — that American health insurance companies have been dropping or denying their policy holders in increasing numbers , endangering untold numbers .
Tomas Asher , chairman of a company that trades in plasma , described the business this way :
“ It ’s like selling hog bellies or wheat or beef .
It gets sold all over . ”
Profiting from ruined American lives is nothing new to Cerberus — which takes its name from the legendary three - headed attack dog of Greek legend who guards the gates of Hell , making sure no condemned soul ever escapes .
How appropriate too .
Cerberus is the same shady fund that bought Chrysler and GMAC in 2007 and drove them into the ground , blamed everything on unions ( even after firing 30,000 Chrysler employees ) , and dumped the companies onto American taxpayers — but only after lining up tens of billions in taxpayer - funded bailout funds .
Cerberus is led by some of the most aggressive “ free market ” Republicans of our time .
The chairman of Cerberus is former Treasury Secretary John Snow — who oversaw the destruction of America ’s economy while serving under Bush from 2003 to 2006 , bragging during his tenure , “ We are the envy of the world . ”
Snow bragged again in 2007 after Cerberus acquired Chrysler : “ Over 25 years ago , when Chrysler faced bankruptcy , it turned to the United States government for assistance .
Today , Chrysler again faces new financial challenges .
But it is private investment stepping in to inject much needed support . ”
A year later , Snow was running around Washington begging and screaming for government handouts like some balding Bob Geldof .
Treasury Secty Jack
Snow thinking , “ God , I envy us . ”
Joining Snow as international chairman for Cerberus is former Republican Vice President Dan Quayle , the pampered imbecile who could n’t spell “ potato ” correctly .
Two more perfect vampires could n’t have been invented than Quayle and Snow for the America of the Bush Era — peanut - brained , sleazy jerks .
The top vampire in Cerberus is the fund ’s founder , billionaire Stephen Feinberg , a major Republican Party campaign donor with a hardcore fetish for Harleys and big guns , and despite being a rich Upper East Side Princeton grad , he drives a Ford pickup ( not a GM or Chrysler , mind you ) and tells everyone he ’s “ blue collar . ”
Supposedly Feinberg was very uncomfortable with taking all those socialism - esque billions from American taxpayers .
The New York Times described him as “ a longtime free - market enthusiast and a Republican who never envisioned himself needing the government for help . ”
What he did envision was callously taking control of Chrysler , stripping it down and making a killing off of it , as Feinberg himself coldly noted in an early 2008 memo to his investors :
“ We do not need to be heroes to earn a good return on the investment in Chrysler , ” he wrote .
“ We do not need to transition the car industry or even to return Chrysler to a much stronger relative position in the U.S. car market in order to be successful . ”
After Feinberg siphoned away billions of taxpayer dollars to pay off his bad investments , he told reporters , “ From the day we bought it , we worked hard to improve it . ”
Patriotism , not profit , he bleated : “ I love this country .
I feel it ’s been great to me .
I had a great chance . ”
To understand how Cerberus has profited from human blood and misery , here ’s some background : the United States is one just a handful of nations around the world where companies can legally pay humans for their blood and then sell it for a profit .
Human plasma is a particularly valuable component of human blood — it ’s harder to extract , and can be used to manufacture all sorts of expensive therapeutic products .
The market for human plasma products has swelled from just $ 2 billion in 1988 to over $ 12 billion per year , and according to a recent Morgan Stanley report , it ’s a fast - growing business .
Despite all the billions that Wall Street ’s vampires earn from plasma , the hapless humans whose veins they milk make barely a pittance –$ 30 dollars or so for spending an hour hooked up to a pumping machine that sucks the blood , sifts out the valuable plasma through a cold filtering process , and reverse - pumps the debased , icy blood back into the plasma donor ’s veins .
It ’s such a miserable way to make cash that Cerberus and its fellow oligopolists have resorted to setting up plasma - sucking franchises along the US - Mexico border , which have mushroomed like Starbucks ’ once did in the ‘90s .
In the latter part of 2009 alone , Cerberus - owned Talecris opened four new plasma - milking factories .
They and their oligopolist colleagues plaster the Mexican side of the border with advertisements promising easy cash , and they even have special plasma - farm buses waiting on the American side of the border to haul their human cargo to those milking dens not within walking distance of the Rio Grande .
Last summer , a reporter for The National newspaper followed an unemployed 46 - year - old Mexican manager from his border town to the pumping station in Brownsville , Texas , which has the highest poverty rate of any city in America :
“ After entering the United States , Castillo did n’t have to walk far to sell his plasma .
A few hundred feet up International Boulevard from the border , the IBR Plasma building sits on Washington Street , across from a Duty Free shop .
The plasma centre still looks very much like the bulk second - hand clothing store it used to be , though long white vertical blinds now hide what goes on behind its windows .
Inside , the waiting room is divided into two sections marked by sheets of paper taped to the wall : one for “ new donors ” and another for “ return donors ” .
This was Castillo ’s first visit , which meant he could make $ 30 – about 400 Mexican pesos .
Signs in Spanish and English offered an additional $ 10 to those who recruited other donors .
“ Castillo lay in the big soft chair , he said , while they inserted the needle and his blood started pumping out .
It was cycled into a machine that spun the red cells from the liquid , as if squeezing whey from curds .
The whey , the watery plasma , was stored in a big plastic bag , while the red blood cells were periodically reinjected into his arm .
While he laid there , he later told me , he wondered about what his plasma was really worth – and where it would end up .
Castillo is an educated man with a degree in business administration ; before coming to Brownsville he had done some research and found , among other things , that in Mexico donating plasma for money is illegal – as is the case in much of the rest of the world . ”
You might think that America would be ashamed of being the world ’s top vampire nation .
But actually , to the faux - market freaks like Cerberus Capital ’s honchos , it just means locking in profits and locking out competition .
Thomas Hecht , who heads a plasma products distribution company in Montreal , quipped :
“ The U. S. is the OPEC of the plasma business .
You know what that stands for : the Organization of Plasma Exporting Countries . ”
But Cerberus is more than just about sucking people ’s blood and government handouts .
Stephen Feinberg also loves killing deer .
In fact he loves shooting deer so much that , like the old Gillette commercial , he bought America ’s guns ‘ n ’ ammo industry .
Two years ago , Cerberus bought Remington , America ’s oldest firearms manufacturer , and since then they ’ve snapped companies making everything from bullets to silencers , which they ’re combining into a new firearms monolith called “ Freedom Group . ”
Cuz you know , those free - marketeers at Cerberus , they ’re all about freedom .
Luckily for Cerberus , weapons sales are “ flying off the store shelves , ” thanks to all the paranoia about Obama socialism , fed by all the bailout money that rightwing billionaires like Cerberus have looted .
Sales have also been boosted by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — in other words , more government handouts for the billionaires , now that they own the guns ‘ n ’ ammo business .
It ’s all going so well that Cerberus is planning a huge IPO this year for Freedom Group , which should net them another massive payout .
So Cerberus profits on both ends : From the bailouts , and from the backlash against bailouts ; from the wars against Muslim terrorists , and from the paranoia back home about an alleged socialist - Muslim - terrorist president .
Either way , the vampires have us where they want us .

PORT -AU - PRINCE ( Reuters ) -
As many as 200,000 people died in the earthquake that devastated Haiti and three - quarters of the capital , Port - au - Prince , will need to be rebuilt , authorities in the Caribbean country said on Friday .
“ We have already collected around 50,000 dead bodies .
We anticipate there will be between 100,000 and 200,000 dead in total , although we will never know the exact number , ” Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien - Aime told Reuters .
Some 40,000 bodies had been buried in mass graves , Secretary of State for Public Safety Aramick Louis said .
If the casualty figures turn out to be accurate , the 7.0 magnitude quake that hit impoverished Haiti on Tuesday would be one of the 10 deadliest earthquakes ever recorded .
Three days after it struck , gangs of robbers had begun preying on survivors living in makeshift camps on sidewalks and streets strewn with rubble and decomposing bodies , as quake aftershocks rippled through the hilly neighborhoods .
Louis said President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive were living in and coordinating the government response from the judicial police headquarters near the airport and their main concern was that desperation was turning to violence .
“ We are sending our police into areas where bandits are starting to operate .
Some people are robbing , are stealing .
That is wrong , ” Louis said .
“ The people in the refugee places , once they do not find food and assistance , they are getting angry and upset .
Our message to everyone is to stay calm . ”
Governments and aid groups around the world poured relief supplies and medical teams into the Caribbean state -- already the poorest in the Western Hemisphere .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was due to visit on Saturday and U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said he would go “ very soon ” [ ID:nN15154130 ] as major powers raced to save lives , speed up supplies and avert unrest in a state with a history of internal conflict .
Planes and ships arrived with rescue teams , search dogs , heavy equipment , tents , water purification units , food , doctors and telecoms teams .
But with a clogged airport , wrecked seaport and roads littered with rubble , as well as the sheer scale of the destruction , aid was not yet reaching hundreds of thousands of victims .
The U.S. State Department said Haiti ’s government granted temporary control of the nation ’s main airport to the United States to speed earthquake relief work .
DAMAGE OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL
Raggedly dressed survivors held out their arms to reporters touring the city , begging for food and water .
“ We have lost everything .
We are waiting for death .
We have nothing to eat , nowhere to live .
We have had no help .
No one has come to see us , ” said quake victim Andres Rosario , speaking at an improvised camp set up by survivors at a rubbish dump in Port - au - Prince .
“ Three - quarters of Port - au - Prince will have to be reconstructed , not just the areas totally destroyed , but also the places where so many houses have structural damage , ” Health Minister Alex Larsen told Reuters .
Reports began to trickle in of heavy damage in the southern coastal city of Jacmel and other areas outside the capital .
U.S. President Barack Obama , who pledged an initial $ 100 million for Haiti quake relief , promised the United States would do what it takes to save lives and get the country back on its feet .
“ The scale of the devastation is extraordinary ... and the losses are heartbreaking , ” Obama said at the White House .

ROADBLOCKS WITH CORPSES
The U.S. military aimed to have about 1,000 troops on the ground in Haiti on Friday , and thousands more in ships offshore .
The total will reach 9,000 to 10,000 troops by Monday .
“ Help is near .
More help is on the way .
We are doing everything we can but it will take days to get help to all the places we need to , ” said Lieutenant General Ken Keen , coordinating the U.S. military effort .
U.S. Navy helicopters had begun taking water ashore and ferrying injured people to a field hospital near the airport .

Police were scarcely seen on the streets , and although some Brazilian U.N. peacekeepers were patrolling , there were reports of sporadic scavenging , some looting and one report of gunshots in downtown Port - au - Prince on Friday .
“ I heard the shots and got out of there .
The police told us it was too dangerous to stay .
People were looting and a body was being burned , ” said a foreign photographer , who asked not to be identified .
At one destroyed supermarket , scores of people swarmed over the rubble to try to reach the food underneath .
Just outside the Cite Soleil slum , desperate people crowded around a burst water pipe jostling to drink from the pipe or fill up buckets .
Some survivors , angry over the delay in getting aid , built roadblocks with corpses on Thursday in one part of the city .
“ Some aid is slowly getting through , but not to many people , ” said Margaret Aguirre , a senior official with International Medical Corps .
The United States said the arrival of its nuclear - powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson with 19 helicopters on Friday would open a second significant channel to deliver help .
NO WATER , NO SUPPLIES
The Pan American Health Organization said at least eight hospitals and health centers in Port - au - Prince had collapsed or sustained damage and were unable to function .
“ We have no supplies .
We need surgical gloves , antibiotics , antiseptic , disinfectant .
We have nothing .
Not even water .
We have children out here with dry mouths and no water to give them , ” said one doctor , Jean Dieudonne Occelien .
Health experts say that while dead bodies smell unpleasant , in cases where people have been killed by trauma and not by contagious diseases such as cholera , there is little health risk from even large numbers of decomposing corpses .
The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti , which has lost at least 36 of its personnel in the quake , was trying to provide some basic coordination from an office near the airport .
In 1968 , US forces in Vietnam were faced with their biggest battles yet :
On January 31,1968 , Viet Cong and NVA forces violated the Tet cease - fire and launched the Tet Offensive all across South Vietnam .
US Army and Marines plus ARVN units , fought 80,000 enemy in bloody battles as they attacked over 100 cities including every provincial capital , and Saigon itself .
US and ARVN forces repelled the communists in weeks , after inflicting very heavy losses on VC / NVA forces .
Simultaneously the NVA surrounded the US Marine base and airfield at Khe Sanh .
NVA artillery , rockets , and mortar fire were placed on Khe Sanh with the intention of inflicting another Dien Bien Phu on the Americans .
Instead President Johnson ordered " Operation Niagara " , one of the heaviest air bombing campaigns in history , in order to destroy the enemy and keep the base in American hands .

This is one in a series of weekly tech talk posts that deal with the technologies of conventional fossil fuel recovery .
They are relatively short and so the descriptions are not provided in detail , rather they are meant so that you can understand some of the complexity of the process , and that it is not always easy .
Last week I wrote about the SAGD process and how it is used to extract the heavy oil / bitumen from the oil sands up in Alberta .
What I will write about this week is the more general topic of In Situ ( " in place " ) Combustion .
I ’ll talk about In Situ production as it relates to coal this week .
Perhaps next week I 'll talk about Toe to Heel Air Injection ( THAI ) , a form of In Situ production which is being tested for use in the oil sands .
The way that we use the majority of the coal , oil and natural gas that comes out of the earth is to burn it so that we can generate heat , which in turn is then used productively , either in the generation of electricity or more directly .
But getting the fuel out of the ground can be quite expensive , either in direct cost or in the amount of energy expended .
And so the question , why ca n’t we just burn it where it is to get the energy out more easily ?
With most deposits , the costs of recovery of the fuel conventionally are still low enough , and the energy recovery at the surface sufficiently high that this would be a losing proposition .
But where coal seams are thin , or the oil is thick , using part of the fuel underground to recover a significant portion of what is left can be a winning proposition .
Of course burning coal underground is not always a deliberate act .
Coal seams have caught fire for a number of reasons , and in parts of the country have burned for decades with significant environmental problems at the surface .
Part of the reason for this is that if the coal seam is relatively close to the surface , then as the coal is burned away , the overlying rock collapses all the way to the surface , opening cracks which allow air to get down to the burning zone , in this way providing oxygen that helps keep the fire burning .
If the fire is burning uncontrollably , then it becomes much more difficult to establish control since the cracks to the surface help keep the fire going , and they may not all be that large and easy to detect .
( Though I have seen some big enough to hold a cow ’s carcass ) .
My own first encounter with underground coal burning was when wandering into a mine that was something like a hundred years old , and being conscious of all the smells in the return air - way .
I was told that an old part of the mine had spontaneously caught fire , could not be extinguished , but had been sealed off and left .
The fire , in that case , was fed oxygen through the mined out passages around the place now on fire .
This brings up the first point , which is that coal can , on its own , catch fire .
The old pit heaps that dotted the landscape around mines were made up of old coal waste , including a fair amount of un-recovered coal .
When they were later reclaimed it was often found that the tips had caught fire and burned the clay into a red - brick - like material .
This self - ignition is known as spontaneous combustion and occurs because coal reacts with atmospheric oxygen even at ambient temperatures and this reaction is exothermic .
If the heat liberated during the process is allowed to accumulate , the rate of the above reaction increases exponentially , and there is a further rise in temperature .
When this temperature reaches the ignition temperature of the coal , it starts to burn - hence the term " spontaneous " combustion .
The temperature at which the coal oxidation reaction becomes self sustaining and at which spontaneous combustion occurs varies generally depending on the type ( nature and rank ) of coal and surrounding conditions of heat dissipation .
In poor quality coal and where the heat retention is high , the coal and carbonacous material may start burning at temperatures as low as 30 - 40° C .
Coal oxidation can occur in coal storage – even on a battleship and , as I mentioned , underground .
The fires are not always spontaneous -- perhaps the most famous is the Centralia fire which Joan Quigley has written about in “ The Day the Earth Caved in . ”
The coal seam outcropped at the surface where it caught fire , and the fire then moved underground and beneath the town of Centralia , PA .
Despite vast amounts of effort , money and time , the fires are still burning .
This brings me to the second point .
For a fire to continue to burn it has to have fuel ( the coal ) and air ( oxygen ) .
If the fire is totally cut - off all the air is consumed and the fire goes out .
But if there are cracks through which air can reach the fire , then it will continue to burn .
Thus , in Centralia , for example , as the coal burned in and under the town , it removed part of the rock holding the town where it was .
The ground would then collapse into the burned out cavity , and a crack would run up to the surface along the edge of the opening , allowing air to flow back down to the fire and continue the progression .
Having been once involved in fighting such an event , it is very difficult to tell where the fire front is , and the coal does not burn in a vertical front , but in a very jagged pattern , depending on air flow and relative composition of the different layers of the coal .
The air generally flows through the cleat pictured here .
But knowing that coal seams can burn in place , we still have to work out how to make that useful .
Short of running water pipes down , and using the steam that comes out for power surely there has to be a better way of getting the energy , and there is .
Before the advent of North Sea gas , British towns were dominated by the Gas Works , old gas - from - coal plants that produced town gas from coal .
Simply put , by heating the coal , and passing air and steam across it , one can generate " producer gas " and
" The final composition of producer gas is about 12 % hydrogen , 25 % carbon monoxide , 7 % carbon dioxide , and 56 % nitrogen ; the nitrogen comes from the air used in the producer gas reaction . "
So that if we can get the water and air to the coal fire underground in the right quantities then we can generate a gas that we can extract , and it can be used as an energy source .
Sounds easy , right ?
It turns out that it is not quite that simple .
From the BERR report on the Chinese work written in 2004 :
Underground coal gasification ( UCG ) experiments have been carried out in many coal mining countries and industrial scale production has been achieved in the former Soviet Union .
More than 15 Mt of coal has been gasified by UCG and in excess of 50 billion m3 of gas has been produced from UCG projects around the world .
Despite research and many trials in different countries , no truly commercially viable UCG project has yet been demonstrated .
However , various technologies are now available which could change this situation .
A shallow seam , commercial power generation project is currently under development in Australia .
The first major plant was at the YEROSTIGAZ facility in Angren , in Uzbekhistan , which started in 1961 , works a brown coal deposit and is now run by Linc Energy .
The plant produced 35 million cu ft of synthetic gas a day , which is fed into the local power plant .
Advantages of the process are seen to be :
* Capital investments in construction of underground coal gasification stations are less by 2.5 times as compared with those in construction of pits and quarries .
*
The productivity of labour is the same as in open - cut mining and 4 times as high as in pits while the cost of final product being the same as in open - cut mining is 3 to 4 times as low as in extraction from pits .
* Hard and dangerous underground labour becomes unnecessary , working conditions are much better , and the extraction process can be completely mechanized and automatically controlled .
* Coal transportation , loading and unloading are excluded .
No fuel is lost in transportation to the user and the atmosphere is not polluted with coal dust .
*
There is no necessity for large areas for waste and ash dumps , and this allows conservation of fertile soil .
The cost of land recultivation is five times as low as that with the conventional method of coal extraction .
The mineless method of underground gasification allows exploitation of coal deposits with unfavourable mining conditions unsuitable for underground or open - cut mining .
This allows more complete utilization of coal resources because non-conditioned and over - balance coal reserves can be used .
*
Unlike coal combustion , the –underground gasification requires no fuel preparation , and consequently , no ash and slag disposal .
No environmental pollution occurs because the gas combustion products are free of solid particles , carbon oxide , sulphur and nitrogen oxides .
The process is illustrated :
Angren UGC process
Linc has since opened the Chinchilla UCG operation with initial tests in August of 2008 , running only air into the coal and recovering gas .
During its almost seven months of operation , the generator has operated very stably , producing gas of consistent quantity and quality .
Gas has been produced with a typical composition ( on a nitrogen - free basis ) of H2 32 % ; CO 17 % ; and CH4 18 % .
The H2 / CO ratio of 1.81 is ideal for Linc Energy 's GTL process .
Since commencing operation of the 3rd UCG generator , Linc Energy has gasified approximately 2000 tonnes of coal , producing over 5 million Nm3 of synthesis gas .
China began building an industrial scale pilot plant in Inner Mongolia in May 2007 .
Seven ignition and production wells reached the coalbed 200 meters below ground by May 23 in the project 's $ 112 million first phase .
The project consists of underground drilling and ignition , aboveground coal - gasification power generation , and chemical production .
The plant is located at the Gonggou Coal Mine in Wulanchabu City and by 2010 will produce 1.5 million cu. m/d of syngas , 100,000 mty of methanol and methane and generate 32.4 million kwh/y of power .
The city is developing a coal - chemical industry with its more than 15 billion tons in coal reserves .
Methane isolated from the syngas will be used to produce town gas and generate electricity .
In Australia Carbon Energy having run a successful 100 day study has started to install a 5 megawatt generator at Bloodwood Creek .
Let me , briefly , concentrate on two problems .
In the initial concept , it was proposed that two wells could be drilled from the surface to the coal seam .
In one early US test of this idea , in Hannah WY , the seam was relatively close to the surface , and for the first test the wells were set 75 ft apart .
After reaching the seam , it was intended that the connecting passage between the injection well and the extraction well would be created by starting a small fire at the bottom of the seam , at the first producing well , and then by blowing air down the injection well have the fire work back to that well along the cleats through which the air was passing .
By restricting the flow it was intended that the passage would be small , and run along the bottom of the seam .
Then , once a passage existed , more air and steam could be fed into the injection well , increasing the size of the fire , and creating the producer gas that could be extracted from the production well .
Unfortunately the fire would not " behave " and over - burned the coal , rather than burning in the lower section , and did not otherwise go as planned .
The conclusion was that this passage had to be artificially created first .
The need for a long hole in the coal requires a directional drilling tool , and in the 1970s when the earlier trials were made , those were not available , particularly ones that could turn ninety degrees within the 140 ft from the surface to the seam .
One had to be invented ( and was ) .
Thus in recent experiments the UK planners have looked at directional drilling from the surface to the coal , as a way of creating the initial passage , and providing paths for the air and steam to the fire and for the producer gas to come out .
Source UK Coal
Two different approaches are being looked at in China , one of which works by creating panels in existing mines from adjacent cross-cuts , while the second uses a pair of directionally drilled holes with the fire to be initiated between them .
Although as I mentioned from the work done in the US , getting that initial connection may be rather difficult , and long - term control of fire location gets to be rather tricky .
Chinese method of UCG Derived from the BERR report .
The use of the two bounding holes confines ( in thinner seams ) the burn to the geometry desired and gives a method of control that is more difficult to achieve in larger seams , or without those bounds .
Heart Curve
What is the Heart Curve ?
The heart curve is a closed curve , which has the shape of a heart .
The heart is well known as a figure on playings cards besides diamonds , cross and spades .
If you speak about a heart , you rather mean the heart figure than the heart shaped curve .
... ...
In the simplest case , a heart is formed by a square standing on its point and two semi-circles sitting on the sides .
Characteristics of the heart figure obviously are a groove above and a point below .
... ... A heart figure develops also if you set two semi-circles upon a triangle .
But here you get two unpleasant corners .
Obviously you expect that these sides are rounded .
... ...
If the point below is missing then do n't speak of a heart but rather of a heart shaped figure .
This form , however , is more similar to the human heart .
The figure on the left is formed by three semi-circles .
Drawn Heart Curves top
Method 1
... ... 1 Draw an isosceles triangle .
2 Draw the perpendiculars to the legs .
They produce a second isosceles triangle .
3 Draw two semi-circles upon the legs of the ( now yellow ) triangle .
Method 2
... ... 1 Draw two touching equal circles .
2 Draw the common tangent .
3 Draw two further ( outer ) tangents from one point of the tangent .
Method 3
... ... 1 Draw a square .
2 Draw four equal circles .
The centres are the corners of the square and the common radius is " half square side " .
Method 4
... ... 1 Draw an ellipse .
2 Turn it about 45° .
3 Reflect it .
4 Form two hearts .
Method 5
... ... 1 Draw the graph of f( x ) =sin(x ) , 0<x < pi/2 .
2 Turn the curve 90° .
Reflect this curve .
3 Form a triangle of these two curves and a straight line .
4 Set two semi-circles upon the triangle .
Method 6
... ... 1 Draw the graph of f( x ) =sin(x ) , - pi/2<x < pi/2 .
2 Turn the curve 90° .
Reflect this curve .
3 Form a triangle of these two curves and a straight line .
4 Set two semi-circles upon the triangle .
Calculated Heart Curves top
It is a challenge to find formulas which produce hearts .
You can describe method 4 by formulas .
The black ellipse has the formula 2x ² - 2xy+y² - 1=0 .
The domain is {x| x>=0} .
The red ellipse has the formula 2x² + 2xy+y² - 1=0 .
The domain is {x| x<=0} .
You can leave out the domain , if you isolate y and use the function f( x ) =|x | .
Then y=|x| + sqrt ( 1 - x² ) and y=|x| - sqrt ( 1 - x² ) describe a heart curve [ ( 7 ) ] .
The formulas y=sqr ( |x| ) + sqrt( 1- x ² ) /\ y=sqrt ( |x| ) - sqrt ( 1 - x² ) are even better .

And how do artists design a heart ?
The heart appears as a well known figure in character sets of programs under MS Windows .
There it is a figure of playings cards besides diamonds , cross and spades .
Here is a choice of well known character sets .
The sets are Normaler Text , Arial , Courier New , Estrangelo Edessa , Lucida Console , Symbol , Times New Roman , Webdings .
If you increase the letters from 12 to 72 you recognize the shapes .
The originally black colour is replaced by the heart colour red .
The upper part of the heart figure is formed by curves similar to arcs .
The lower lines do not approach linearly to the point but usually are at first inward and then outward curved .
That gives the heart a special sweep .

Heart Curve or Cardioid top
How to produce it
... ...
Draw a circle ( on the left , yellow ) and roll an equal circle on it .
Fix one point on the moving circle line and follow this point .
It describes the heart curve or cardioid ( on the right ) .
... ...
Another way of producing a heart
... ... A cardioid can also be seen as the envelope of circles .
Draw a ( yellow ) circle and a fixed point P on the circle line .
All circles that pass through the fixed point P and have their centres on the ( yellow ) circle have a cardioid as an envelope .
Area and perimeter of the heart curve
Use the polar form r=2 a [ 1+cos ( t ) ] as the simplest equation for calculating the area A and the perimeter U .
The origin of a coordinate system lies in the point of the cardioid .
The perimeter is a rational number .
A square with the side 4a has the same one .
Mandelbrot Set and Cardioid
... ... The " main figure " of the Mandelbrot set has the form of the cardioid .
The German name Apfelmännchen ( apple man ) uses this shape .
Actually the main figure is a cardioid .
The points of the Mandelbrot set , which have convergent sequences , lie inside a cardioid .

There you find a proof and more references .
The picture was taken from my page Mandelbrot Set .
Catacaustic and Cardioid
... ...
If light is falling on a spheric mirror ( wedding ring in the sun light ) , the reflecting rays form a special surface , the catacaustic .
It is n't a cardioid but a nephroid .
A cardioid develops as an envelope , if the rays start at a point on the circle and are reflected at the circle ( drawing on the right ) .

Characteristic Curve of a Microphone
... ... Microphones have a certain characteristic curve .
In the plane it is a circle for the " sound- pressure - receiver " and similar to a lying eight figure for the " sound- velocity - receiver " .
Special receivers like condenser microphones have both capacities .
Their characteristic curve develops by overlaying to a cardioid .

The Broken Heart top
The broken heart ( Das gebrochene Herz ) is a tangram game .
... ...
Lay inside a square two circles and draw some lines .
A heart develops , which is divided in nine pieces .
The fun is to lay a heart with the pieces or to discover new figures like those on the right .

Found on the Internet ;-) :
Eight out of every ten Americans have searched for medical information online .
Three - quarters of these searchers do not scrutinize the quality , validity , or date of the information .
With the overabundance of healthcare information available on the World Wide Web , people looking for quality medical information could easily be led astray .
The unnecessary escalation of health concerns — newly - termed “ cyberchondria ” — is the focus of a study conducted by Microsoft , and it could have serious implications for many patients .
Approximately 13 % of physician visits every year are for medically unexplained symptoms , and up to 25 % of patients report such symptoms during physician visits .
Often , patients report persistent physical symptoms , but no somatic origin can be found .
Physicians may try to explore the psychological basis of the symptoms , but this is a frustrating and futile prospect that uses valuable time and resources with no satisfactory result for the patient .
Many hypochondriacal patients are taking their concerns to the Internet and making “ Google ” a diagnostic procedure .
Researchers at Microsoft recently examined how people search for medical information on the Internet , and reported on its potential implications .
The researchers reviewed logs of 515 individual ’s health - related Web search experiences .
Not surprisingly , one principal finding was that search engines have the potential to escalate medical concerns .
The authors assert that the escalation is related to the amount of medical content viewed by searchers , the existence of escalatory terminology in the Web pages , and the searcher ’s predisposition to escalate his or her anxiety versus seeking more sensible explanations for physical symptoms .
The Microsoft researchers also found that post - session anxiety lingers after escalations of medical concerns , often to an extent that interrupts other Web - related activities .
The information obtained from the Web also influences people ’s decisions about visiting a physician , diagnosing or treating ailments , or engaging in proactive health activities .
One worrisome finding of the Microsoft study concluded that some users of search engines interpreted the ranking of the Web search results as the likelihood of the illness .
The Web can ultimately be a dangerous place for people to seek advice , with no guidance on deciphering fact from fiction , and everything in between .
Not all who seek Web - based information will be misled , but the potential for the wrong information falling into the wrong hands is considerable .
Patients should heed a “ let the searcher beware ” and always obtain sounds medical advice from a trained health care professional .
Physicians , however , should be attentive to the needs of patients and maintain open lines of communication when considering all of a patient ’s symptoms .

But it now appears that the estimate about Himalayan glacial melt was based on a decade - old interview of one climate scientist in a science magazine , The New Scientist , and that hard scientific evidence to support that figure is lacking .
The scientist , Dr. Syed Hasnain , a glacier specialist with the government of the Indian state of Sikkim and currently a fellow at the TERI research institute in Delhi , said in an e-mail message that he was “ misquoted ” about the 2035 estimate in The New Scientist article .
He has more recently said that his research suggests that only small glaciers could disappear entirely .
The panel , which relies on contributions from hundreds of scientists , is considering whether to amend the estimate or remove it .
“ The I.P.C.C. considers this a very serious issue and we ’re working very hard to set the record straight as soon as we can , ” said Christopher Field , co-chairman of the panel ’s section that was responsible for the report , which deals with impacts , adaptation and vulnerability .
He noted that the potentially erroneous figure in question had appeared only in the panel ’s full report of more than 1,000 pages and had been omitted in later summary documents that the panel produced to guide policy .
The summaries said only that the Himalayan glaciers “ could decay at very rapid rates ” if warming continued .
Such documents are produced after panel members review a full - length report , although if a figure in the report is deemed to be in error , it is supposed to be removed .
Still , the revelation is the latest in a string of events that climate change skeptics have seized on to support their contention that fears about warming are unfounded , or at least overblown .
Late last year , hackers obtained private e-mail messages from leading researchers at the University of East Anglia in England suggesting they were altering the presentation of some data in a way that emphasized the human influence on climate change .
The new [ Cuban ] ration book surprised us at the end of December , just when speculation was growing about the demise of this booklet with its grid - paper pages .
It arrived , like every year , surrounded by anxiety and annoyance , submerging us in that avoidance - approximation conflict generated by the subsidized .
In its little pages I notice the absence of many products that once made up the monthly quota , now reduced to just a monotonous repertoire with insufficient nutritional values and rising costs .
For the first time in our house we are all in the same age bracket among the five defined by the Ministry of Internal Commerce .
Exactly in the box for 14 to 64 years my son
Teo appears , together with Reinaldo and me , but at least three generations of Cubans have seen the store clerks mark down what we can put in our mouths .
Trapped in poverty , millions of compatriots depend on price assistance to survive .
Rationing is a trampoline and falling is certain , a dependency we all wish would end , but that almost no one can let go .
I see my name written next to my son Teo ’s and I ’m afraid that his children , too , will receive milk only until the age of 7 , be allotted washing soap every 2 months or a tasteless toothpaste to clean their teeth .
I shudder imagining that in 30 years we will still have to prove , with a doctor ’s certificate , that we have an ulcer to have the right to a few ounces of meat or a container of soy yogurt .
With its minimal quantities and doubtful quality , the ration market has also instilled in us an unhealthy gratitude and a guilt complex that can not be our legacy to those yet to come .
If another December arrives and we receive a new ration book , it will not be because we have avoided the economic cuts , but rather because we have fallen another step lower in our citizen autonomy .

MP : As much as Americans might complain about greedy corporations , excessive CEO compensation , low non-union wages at Wal - Mart , high gas prices , income inequality , stagnant real wages , the disappearing middle class , etc . or whatever the current whining du jour is , just imagine what it would be like to live in a country like Cuba where your daily purchases of food were restricted and controlled by bureaucrat - determined quotas , and you actually had to present a rationing book to a civil servant ( an inaccurate description , since they 're rarely civil or servile in reality ) clerk at a government - operated grocery store as a pre-requisite to buy food for you and your family .
I 'll glady live with excessive CEO pay for Oprah , Bill Gates and Warren Buffet in a market economy any day over having to present a rationing book to a government bureaucrat to buy food like the citizens of Cuba are required to do daily .
I idly watched a two hour television production last night entitled " Two weeks in Hell . "
It was about the two week pre-selection period at Ft. Bragg in which the Army now decides if volunteers have what it takes to even start training to be a Special Forces soldier .
Wow !
The first week seems to be intended to separate the boys from the men and the second week to see if the men who are left can work together under extreme stress .
There is no doubt that it is a very tough process .
The " candidates " as they are called carry around immense rucksacks all the time .
They are systematically deprived of sleep and other rest , are placed in a seemingly unending series of unexpected and nearly insoluble problem situations and run through some of the nastiest obstacle courses I have ever seen , and I have seen some beauties .
I have some doubts about what results .
I went through the SF Officer Course in 1964 .
the Army Special Forces Regiment was 11 years old by my calculation from the date of establishment of the 77th SF Group .
The enlisted guys were trained in what was then called the SF Training Group .
I never saw what happened over there .
I know they received what was called " branch training , " and then occupational specialty training somewhere else before they went to a unit .
The specialties were ; weapons , ( light and heavy ) demolitions , commmunications and medical .
The medical course was a year long and had a long practicum in a hospital .
The officer course was four or five months long .
SF was a " branch immaterial " assignment in those days .
So , the officers were of any Army branch except JAG .
We were organized in student detachments like an " ODA . "
There were a lot of foreign officers ; Vietnamese , French , British , Greek , Italian , Canadian are the ones I remember from my course .
There was a PT test at the beginning and then a lot of forced marches and running , but it was simply assumed that you could do whatever was expected of you .
There was a tremendous amount of work out in the woods ; patrols ususally parachute delivered at night and into an obstacle like a swamp , major exercizes in which you linked up with local mountaineers in western North Carolina who " played " guerrillas for you to train and guide .
There was a lot of specific technical training on all the things the enlisted guys were learning as career specialties .
There was a lot of " weeding out . "
The wash - out rate was high .
For officers that is a career killer .
There was no harassment .
None at all .
" The Quiet Professionals . "
You were told over and over again that if you have to yell at someone , then you have lost that man , probably forever .
Guerrillas are civilians .
They will kill you for shaming them .
Persuasion , charm , understanding of where HE is coming from , courage in adversity .
Those were the things that were taught .
You have to have a certain grade of material as students to be able to teach lessons like that .
When I got to my first SF unit , I found that the men were better soldiers than the officers .
They really did not need us , but , the army has to have officers .
This need is in the bloodstream .
Our soldiers were an interesting collection ; old paratroop sergeants from the 82nd and the 101st , some of them still around from WW2 and Korea .
Some of these guys had been sergeants before there had been such a thing as SF .
There were many New Americans ; Wehrmacht veterans , French and Spanish Foreign Legion , Finnish Ski Hunt Commandos , former Royal Marines .
You name it , we had it .
These men were something out of the Iliad .
To say that a 25 year old kid like me was their leader was a bit comic , but they did n't seem to feel that way .
They simply took charge of the " college boy " officer replacements continuing training and looked pleased when you did something right .
Needless to say , they had not been selected in anything like the brutal , searing way that I watched last night .
They had selected themselves .
There was nothing that they did not know about soldiering .
After a while , when you saw that they accepted you , there was no greater privilege than to be their " boss . "
SF work is a thinking soldier 's work .
You have to be tough physically , but , it is equally important that you be smart .
I wonder how many thinking soldiers are excluded from the regiment by what I saw last night , by an insistence on physicality before all else .
I wonder how many of the old timers could have passed that test .

I had just finished opening an account at the local bank late last week when I happened to catch a glimpse of the bank manager ’s computer screen :
He had about 20 Web browser windows open , and it was hard to ignore the fact that he was using Internet Explorer 6 to surf the Web .
For more than a second I paused , and considered asking for my deposit back .
“ Whoa , ” I said .
“ Are you really still using IE6 ? ”
“ Yeah , ” the guy grinned sheepishly , shaking his head .
“ We ’re supposed to get new computers soon , but I dunno , that ’s been a long time coming . ”
“ Wow .
That ’s nuts , ” I said .
“ You ’ve heard about this latest attack on IE , right ? ”
I might as well have asked him about the airspeed velocity of an African Swallow .
Dude just shook his head , and so did I .
Well , you ca n’t really blame the poor guy for not knowing .
Just hours before , Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer looked a bit like a deer in headlights when , standing in front of the White House in a planned CNBC interview on how the Obama administration is looking to use technology to streamline its operations , he was suddenly asked about a report just released from McAfee effectively blaming a slew of recent cyber break - ins at Google , Adobe and more than 30 top other Silicon Valley firms on a previously unknown flaw in IE .
“ Cyber attacks and occasional vulnerabilities are a way of life , ” Ballmer said .
“ If the issue is with us , we ’ll work through it with all of the important parties .
We have a whole team of people that responds very real time to any report that it may have something to do with our software , which we do n’t know yet . ”
Microsoft has of course since acknowledged that a critical , unpatched security flaw indeed exists and is being exploited in targeted attacks .
The software giant says it has only observed the now - public exploit code working against IE6 , and that IE users should upgrade to the latest version IE8 , which Microsoft says is much better insulated from the current batch of exploits .
Redmond typically releases software updates on the second Tuesday of each month ( a.k.a. “ Patch Tuesday ) , but the company said in this case customers may not have to wait until Feb.
9 for a patch for this security hole .
Microsoft is eager to assure everyone that the attacks observed so far are only successful against IE6 , and that in any event they have not been widespread .
Meanwhile , researchers continue to test that claim .
Researcher Dino Dai Zovi Tweeted Monday that he had modified the existing exploit so that it worked on IE7 , with the caveat that on Microsoft Vista systems it would only allow an attacker read access to the victim ’s files ( as opposed to full privileges to delete or modify system files ) .
In a sign that we may very soon start to see a number of hacked and malicious Web sites leveraging this flaw to install unwanted software , security firm Websense warned that it had spotted a Web site that was exploiting the IE vulnerability .
Microsoft ’s assurances have not been enough for some .
The governments of France and Germany have urged people to stop using Internet Explorer ( Update , 1:16 p.m : The Australian government just issued a similar warning ) .
For its part , the U.S. government is expected to issue a demarche to the Chinese government , looking for an explanation of the attacks against Google and others , which experts have described as a sophisticated and targeted attempts to steal trade industry secrets , as well as information about Chinese dissident groups .
At least one top Chinese computer security firm is urging consumers there not to wait for Microsoft ’s patch , but to instead install an unofficial , stop gap fix ( rough , Google translation ) .
No doubt , if the wait drags on for an update from Microsoft , we will see the same offers from U.S. security firms and experts .
There are , of course , alternatives to IE .
But then again , I ’m preaching to the choir .
Most of my readers already use another browser , according to the latest visitor stats for krebsonsecurity.com , compliments of Google Analytics .
Here ’s how my visitors break down :
Looks like krebsonsecurity .com does have some IE6 users ( and at least one IE5 ! user ) .
Nearly 14 percent of the visitors browsing this site with IE are using IE6 : Here ’s the visitor breakdown by IE version :
If you do want to keep browsing with IE ( or , work at an organization like my bank which apparently does n’t have much choice in the matter ) , Microsoft has some tips here on ways to leverage additional protections both in Windows and in newer IE versions .

j Query Lint is a simple script you can download and use with jQuery .
It works over the top of jQuery and diligently reports errors and any incorrect usage of jQuery .
It will also , to some extent , offer guidance on best practices and performance concerns .
Unlike JSLint , jQuery Lint is a runtime reporter .
To use it , you need to include it , after jQuery , in your document :
< script src = " jquery.js " ></ script > < script src = " jquery.lint.js " ></ script >
j Query lint ’s main objective is to notify you of incorrect usages of jQuery ’s API .
So , if you pass incorrect arguments to any method then jQuery Lint will let you know .
It compares your arguments to the argument signatures in jQuery ’s API .
It reports via Firebug , although you can quite easily plug - in your own console mechanism .
It has four different error - reporting levels ( accessible via jQuery .
LINT.level ) , zero reports nothing , three will report everything , including small things like using css ( ).css ( ) .css ( ) instead of css ({...} ) .
It ’s quite configurable too .
You can add your own checks .
E.g .
j Query .
LINT . special [ 1 ] .
j Query = jQuery .
LINT . special [ 1 ] . j Query || [ ] ; //
Add check on error - reporting level one .
//
Check jQuery method .
j Query .
LINT . special [ 1 ] .
j Query . push ( function ( selector , context ) { if ( selector === '*' ) { return " Do n't use the universal selector ! " ; } } ) ;
j Query Lint tries to help you in determining where the problem occurred in your code .
It ’s not much help to you if it just says , “ Err , you called css ( ) incorrectly ! ” .
If it occurred as a result of an event then Lint will say so , and if you ’re using a browser that provides a stack - trace as part of its Error object ( like Firefox ) then Lint will also provide you with the file - name and line number .
E.g .
You can read more about jQuery Lint and download it at Github :
j Query Lint @ Github
The idea of a lint - like script for jQuery has been floating around for some time .
I want to thank Dave Methvin in particular , for it was his idea that sparked my interest originally .
This is quite a young project , so there will be bugs .
Please report them !
Thanks for reading !
Please share your thoughts with me on Twitter .
Have a great day !
On Elizabeth Warren :
Professor Elizabeth Warren is the Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard University .
She has written eight books and more than a hundred scholarly articles dealing with credit and economic stress .
Her latest two books , The Two - Income Trap and All Your Worth , were both on national best seller lists .
She has been principal investigator on empirical studies funded by the National Science Foundation and more than a dozen private foundations .
Warren was the Chief Adviser to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission , and she was appointed as the first academic member of the Federal Judicial Education Committee .
She currently serves as a member of the Commission on Economic Inclusion established by the FDIC .
She also serves on the steering committees of the Tobin Project and the National Bankruptcy Conference .
The National Law Journal has repeatedly named Professor Warren as one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Attorneys in America , and SmartMoney Magazine recently designated her one of the SmartMoney 30 for 2008 .
She was also one of eight law professors to be named on the Leading Lawyers in America list compiled by Law Dragon .
( Taken from the COP website )
Ok all officialspeak aside , Elizabeth Warren is a hell of a sharp lady who regardless of life 's successes , remembers her middle class roots and she understands what we , the average citizen has to endure .
She has a firm grasp of what happened to the US economy and knows exactly what should be done about it .
She has written books and articles about everything from high Wall Street BS to books about normal , every day household finances .
She gets us .
She is praying the family 's immigration nightmare will end soon and that Whiteley can come home to Texas — the only home he knows .
McMillan , 43 , was 8 when her parents brought home the baby they named Robin .
Now , because of missteps the parents made in the complicated international adoption process — and bad decisions on his part —
Whiteley , 35 , has been deported to Mexico .
“ He is not an undocumented immigrant , ” McMillan said .
“ He did not falsify any documents .
He did n't sneak over here .
He is an American . ”
Her brother is a man without a country .
In 1974 , a midwife in El Paso placed a day - old baby in the arms of Lora and Royce Whiteley of Fort Worth .
Six years later , while living in Woodville , they officially adopted Robin .
The Whiteleys moved to Lufkin in 1984 .
Bad decisions
McMillan , who also was born in Mexico and was adopted as an infant by the Whiteleys , recalls her little brother as most big sisters would — a boy who bothered and teased her .
But she looked after him .
“ I always felt very protective of Robin , ” McMillan said .
“ He was like my own baby doll .
I took care of my little brother . ”
As he grew up , Whiteley was athletic and into boxing in Lufkin , she said .
“ He was just your normal , crazy kid and a typical teen . ”
But even Whiteley admits that he made bad decisions .
State criminal records show that he had some misdemeanor convictions , and he went to state prison for a felony drug conviction .
When the time came for his release from prison in 2002 , he fell down the immigration rabbit hole .
Neither the United States nor Mexico has a record of his birth , said his lawyer , Andres Lopez of McAllen .
And his parents had pursued legal residency for him but not citizenship .
Lacking a birth certificate and naturalization papers , Whiteley , who does n't speak Spanish , was deported to Mexico on the assumption that it was his country of origin , Lopez said .
He now lives as an undocumented immigrant in an apartment in Reynosa , Mexico .
Back and forth
Since his deportation , Whiteley has illegally entered the U.S. twice to see his children , which has not helped his case .
“ We have been back and forth with immigration over the adoption , ” Lora Whiteley , 74 , said by phone from Lufkin .
Each time progress was made on getting proper documentation for Whiteley , the immigration laws changed , she said .
The laws on immigration and foreign adoptions are complicated , said Heidi Cox , executive vice president and general counsel for the Gladney Center in Fort Worth , which has provided foreign and domestic adoption services for more than 100 years .
“ Your Texas adoption will establish that you are the parent , but not that the child is a citizen , ” she said .
“ The adoption decree does not establish citizenship ( but only ) the legal parent - child relationship . ”
Lopez said Whiteley 's parents received bad advice and did not pursue citizenship for him .
“ They did what they were told , but it was n't what they needed , ” said Lopez , who meets weekly with his client in Mexico .
He is working on an appeal on Whiteley 's behalf .
Whiteley spends his days in his one - room apartment in Reynosa , about 11 miles from McAllen , where he knew no one before he arrived .
He has a bed , a television , a DVD player , a hot plate to warm food , and an American cell phone so he can talk to his family .
He bathes with cold water out of a 5 - gallon bucket , the same one he uses to hand - wash his clothes .
He goes to a local store to use the restroom , he said .
He can't work in Mexico because he does n't have proper documents , and if caught working illegally , he would be deported .
Whiteley 's wife and children have moved from Lufkin to Mission in the Rio Grande Valley to be close enough to cross over and visit their husband and father .
“ I committed a crime .
I deserved to go to jail at the time , and I believe I paid for that , ” he said .
“ But I did n't deserve to be taken away from the only country I 've ever known in my life ” for a paperwork mistake .
McMillan and her mother have written to politicians .
They hope that Congress will enact the Foreign Adopted Children 's Equality Act , which would recognize that internationally adopted children of American citizens deserve to be treated as children of American citizens , not as immigrants .
KANSAS CITY ( Reuters ) - Monsanto
Co said on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Justice has issued a civil investigative demand for information on the company ’s key soybean genetic traits business after complaints that Monsanto was trying to limit access to push a new , pricier product instead .
Monsanto said it was cooperating with investigators , and reiterated that it would allow farmers and seed companies continued access to its first - generation Roundup Ready soybean trait -- a genetic alteration that makes the soybeans tolerate herbicide treatments -- following that product ’s patent expiration in 2014 .
Seed dealers , rivals and others have complained that Monsanto was creating conditions , through contracts with seed dealers and other means , that would unfairly push farmers to buy its new Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans and away from the first - generation , lower - priced Roundup Ready beans .
But Monsanto has said repeatedly over the last month that it will not try to stop farmers from saving and replanting its Roundup Ready soybeans after the patent expires and rivals will be able to continue to incorporate the Roundup Ready - tolerant trait into their products .
The company said it will not enforce contracts requiring seed companies to destroy or return Roundup Ready seed after patent expiration .
“ We respect the thorough regulatory process , ” said Scott Partridge , Monsanto ’s chief deputy general counsel .
“ We believe our business practices are fair , pro-competitive and in compliance with the law . ”
The fresh demand notice from investigators comes amid a larger probe into competition in the agriculture industry and a specific look at the seed industry , where Monsanto is a world leader .
More than 90 percent of the soybeans grown in the United States are estimated to contain the Roundup Ready trait .
Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona declined to comment on Monsanto on Thursday , other than to say “ the antitrust division is investigating the possibility of anti-competitive practices in the seed industry . ”
The Justice Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture will be holding five hearings later this year to discuss fair play and concentration in agricultural marketing .
Shares of Monsanto fell 1.5 percent to $ 82.67 on the New York Stock Exchange early Thursday afternoon .
Analysts say signs point to a limited probe by regulators .
“ We expect this to be the sole focus of the Department of Justice ’s inquiry into Monsanto , and that a formal lawsuit will not be filed , ” Morgan Stanley analyst Vincent Andrews wrote in a note to investors .
“ We believe that the DOJ spent the last several months comprehensively reviewing Monsanto ’s businesses and that the very narrow scope of the CID request likely indicates no DOJ interest in the remainder of Monsanto ’s operating and practices . ”
News that the Justice Department was seeking information on market access to the Roundup Ready trait comes a week after rival DuPont specifically asked U.S. regulators to gain assurances from Monsanto regarding the Roundup Ready trait access .
The trait is a genetic alteration that Monsanto developed to make soybeans withstand treatment of Monsanto ’s Roundup herbicide .
DuPont , which owns Pioneer Hi-Bred International , has also complained that Monsanto is unfairly using monopoly powers to drive up prices and hinder competition in the broad corn and soybean markets .
Well , Netflix is officially available for all that play video games , no matter what you play them on .
Netflix is now supported by the PC , MAC , Xbox 360 , PS3 , and as of this Spring the Nintendo Wii .
This statement was released from Netflix Co .
“ Our research shows that 86 percent of all U.S. Wii consoles are located in the living room , ” said Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils - Aime .
“ The Wii console is the social hub around which friends and family members gather to play games and have fun .
Soon both new and longtime Wii owners will enjoy the benefits of Netflix – and a variety of informational and entertainment options – by being Netflix members and connecting their consoles to the Internet . ”
“ Our goal is to offer Netflix members as many ways as possible to watch movies and TV episodes streamed from Netflix right to their TVs and to give non-members more and compelling reasons to consider the service , ” said Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings .
“ Joining forces with Nintendo , which has been so immensely popular with consumers since its introduction , is a very meaningful step in that direction . ”
From what we understand , the Wii like the PS3 will also need a Software Disc in the machine in order to watch movies .
No word if this will be patched in via firmware .
What do we think Elder - Geeks , will this catch with the Wii crowd ?
Mother ' not clever enough to raise child ' has baby snatched by social workers after running away to Ireland to give birth
A couple who fled to Ireland after social workers threatened to remove their baby at birth have had the newborn snatched after all .
Kerry Robertson , 17 , who has mild learning difficulties , and Mark McDougall , 25 , went on the run after British social services said she was not clever enough to raise a child .
But just four days after Ben was born , Irish social workers marched into the maternity ward and forced them to hand him over .
Proud mother : Kerry Robertson and Ben , who she is n't allowed to bring up
They were told they were acting at the behest of their British counterparts .
The couple , from Fife , Scotland , have been on the run for three months .
In September , their wedding was halted just 48 hours before the service when social workers claimed Miss Robertson was not bright enough to understand the marriage declaration .
Then in November they were told that her ‘ disability ’ meant their baby would be taken away at birth .
With Miss Robertson 29 weeks pregnant , they fled their house in the middle of the night and travelled to Ireland .
Ben was born healthy and weighing 7lb 3 oz last Friday .
Last night Miss Robertson said : ‘ When the Irish social workers said I had to give the baby to them , I felt sick .
‘ I did n’t want to hand him over and I started crying because I could n’t believe what they were saying .
I thought I had misunderstood .
‘ I had just been breastfeeding him .
Just before they took him away , I told Ben I loved him and gave him a kiss . ’
Mr McDougall added : ‘ Kerry let out a dreadful cry when she realised what was happening – it was terrible .
She is just in pieces .
‘ We believed that the Irish had more traditional values than social workers in the UK .
We found a two - bedroom cottage in a beautiful village in Waterford overlooking the sea .
A family divided : Father Mark with Kerry and the baby , who is now in foster care
‘ Kerry booked herself in with the local GP and at last we began to feel as if we were safe . ’
An anonymous benefactor has been funding the couple after they left home with just £ 200 , and has even paid for the house .
Artist Mr McDougall has also been selling pictures while friends and family have donated clothes , baby gear and further money .
Miss Robertson has been cared for by her grandmother since the age of nine months after her own parents were unable to look after her , with her care overseen by Fife Council .
She began getting contractions last Friday and the couple went to the local hospital , where she gave birth after a natural labour .
‘ Both of us were overjoyed , ’ said Mr McDougall .
‘ Ben was absolutely perfect . ’
But on Tuesday morning two Irish social workers – a man and a woman – came to the hospital and delivered the bombshell .
Mr McDougall added : ‘ It seems that through Kerry ’s medical records – although we have been on the run she has always ensured she had all the checks and scans on the baby – Fife Council had been alerted .
‘ The social workers said that now Ben was born , Fife had put him on the at - risk register and he was subject to a care order .
As the social workers told us the news , the two midwives who have been caring for Kerry were so distressed that they fled the room . ’
Ben is being cared for by foster parents .
Family law experts said that if Fife had genuine concerns about the baby it had a duty to pursue the couple even once they had fled its jurisdiction .
Under a 1980 European convention on child welfare , they would have contacted the Irish authorities to alert them and the Irish would then have sought an order from a judge allowing them to intervene .
Irish social workers now have to investigate for themselves and have until Monday to make a decision on the case or apply for an extension .
The couple have been allowed to see their son for two hours every other day .
Miss Robertson said : ‘ Holding him made me upset all over again .
I ’ve told the social workers I do n’t want him to have bottled milk or a dummy .
I feel breastfeeding is so important and at least then he is still having some of me . ’
Mr McDougall claimed the care order had the wrong baby ’s name on it and the wrong date of birth .
He added : ‘ Kerry and I are now absolutely furious because we believe our baby has been kidnapped by social services . ’
LibDem MP John Hemming , who has been supporting the couple , said : ‘ There is no evidence that Mark and Kerry can not be good parents and I just hope that the Irish authorities can resolve this as quickly as possible . ’
The Irish authorities refused to comment last night .
Stephen Moore , executive director of social work at Fife Council , said : ‘ I can confirm that although the Robertson family are not presently within Fife , we are committed to working closely with professional colleagues elsewhere to ensure safety and welfare of the child and indeed the whole family as this is of paramount concern to us .
‘ I would urge Kerry to use all the support that is being made available to her and her baby and to get appropriate help should she need it . ’
It used to puzzle me that Scott Aaronson still has n't come to terms with the obvious absurdity of attempts to make quantum mechanics yield a single world .
I should have realized what was going on when I read Scott 's blog post " The bullet - swallowers " in which Scott compares many - worlds to libertarianism .
But light did n't dawn until my recent diavlog with Scott , where , at 50 minutes and 20 seconds , Scott says :
" What you 've forced me to realize , Eliezer , and I thank you for this :
What I 'm uncomfortable with is not the many - worlds interpretation itself , it 's the air of satisfaction that often comes with it . "
-- Scott Aaronson , 50:20 in our Bloggingheads dialogue .
It does n't show on my face ( I need to learn to reveal my expressions more , people complain that I 'm eerily motionless during these diavlogs ) but at this point I 'm thinking , Did n't Scott just outright concede the argument ?
( He did n't ; I checked . )
I mean , to me this sounds an awful lot like :
Sure , many - worlds is the simplest explanation that fits the facts , but I do n't like the people who believe it .
And I strongly suspect that a lot of people out there who would refuse to identify themselves as " atheists " would say almost exactly the same thing :
What I 'm uncomfortable with is n't the idea of a god - free physical universe , it 's the air of satisfaction that atheists give off .
If you 're a regular reader of Robin Hanson , you might essay a Hansonian explanation as follows :
Although the actual state of evidence favors many - worlds ( atheism ) , I do n't want to affiliate with other people who say so .
They act all brash , arrogant , and offensive , and tend to believe and advocate other odd ideas like libertarianism .
If I believed in many - worlds ( atheism ) , that would make me part of this low - prestige group .
Or in simpler psychology :
I do n't feel like I belong with the group that believes in many - worlds ( atheism ) .
I think this might form a very general sort of status catch - 22 for contrarian ideas .
When a correct contrarian idea comes along , it will have appealing qualities like simplicity and favorable evidence ( in the case of factual beliefs ) or high expected utility ( in the case of policy proposals ) .
When an appealing contrarian idea comes along , it will be initially supported by its appealing qualities , and opposed by the fact that it seems strange and unusual , or any other counterintuitive aspects it may have .
So initially , the group of people who are most likely to support the contrarian idea , are the people who are - among other things - most likely to break with their herd in support of an idea that seems true or right .
These first supporters are likely to be the sort of people who - rather than being careful to speak of the new idea in the cautious tones prudent to supplicate the many high - status insiders who believe otherwise - just go around talking as if the idea had a very high probability , merely because it seems to them like the simplest explanation that fits the facts .
" Arrogant " , " brash " , and " condescending " are some of the terms used to describe people with this poor political sense .
The people first to speak out in support of the new idea will be those less sensitive to conformity ; those with more confidence in their sense of truth or rightness ; those less afraid of speaking out .
And to the extent these are general character traits , such first supporters are also more likely to advocate other contrarian beliefs , like libertarianism or strident atheism or cryonics .
And once that happens , the only people who'll be willing to believe the idea will be those willing to tar themselves by affiliating with a group of arrogant nonconformists - on top of everything else !
tl ;dr :
When a counterintuitive new idea comes along , the first people to support it will be contrarians , and so the new idea will become associated with contrarian traits and beliefs , and people will become even more reluctant to believe it because that would affiliate them with low - prestige people / traits / beliefs .
A further remark on " airs of satisfaction " :
Talk about how we do n't understand the Born Probabilities and there are still open questions in QM , and hence we can't accept the no-worldeaters interpretation , sounds a good deal like the criticism given to atheists who go around advocating the no-God interpretation .
" But there 's so much we do n't know about the universe !
Why are you so self - satisfied with your disbelief in God ? "
There 's plenty we do n't understand about the universe , but that does n't mean that future discoveries are likely to reveal Jehovah any more than they 're likely to reveal a collapse postulate .
Furthermore , atheists are more likely than priests to hear " But we do n't know everything about the universe " or " What 's with this air of satisfaction ? "
Similarly , it looks to me like you can get away with speaking out strongly in favor of collapse postulates and against many - worlds , and the same people wo n't call you on an " air of satisfaction " or say " but what about the open questions in quantum mechanics ? "
This is why I think that what we have here is just a sense of someone being too confident in an unusual belief given their assigned social status , rather than a genuine sense that we can't be too confident in any statement whatever .
The instinctive status hierarchy treats factual beliefs in pretty much the same way as policy proposals .
Just as you need to be extremely high - status to go off and say on your own that the tribe should do something unusual , there 's a similar dissonance from a low - status person saying on their own to believe something unusual , without careful compromises with other factions .
It shows the one has no sense of their appropriate status in the hierarchy , and is n't sensitive to other factions ' interests .
The pure , uncompromising rejection merited by hypotheses like Jehovah or collapse postulates , socially appears as a refusal to make compromises with the majority , or a lack of sufficient humility when contradicting high - prestige people .
( Also priests have higher social status to start with ; it 's understood that their place is to say and advocate these various things ; and priests are better at faking humility while going on doing whatever they were going to do anyway . )
The Copenhagen interpretation of QM - however ridiculous - is recognized as a conventional non-strange belief , so no one 's going to call you insufficiently humble for advocating it .
That would mark them as the contrarians .
Weather and climate are different .
Weather varies tremendously from day to day , week to week , season to season .
Climate , on the other hand is average weather over a period of years ; it can be thought of as the boundary conditions on the variability of weather .
We might get an extreme cold snap , or a heatwave at a particular location , but our knowledge of the local climate tells us that these things are unusual , temporary phenomena , and sooner or later things will return to normal .
Forecasting the weather is therefore very different from forecasting changes in the climate .
One is an initial value problem , and the other is a boundary value problem .
Let me explain .
Good weather forecasts depend upon an accurate knowledge of the current state of the weather system .
You gather as much data you can about current temperatures , winds , clouds , etc. , feed them all into a simulation model and then run it forward to see what happens .
This is hard because the weather is an incredibly complex system .
The amount of information needed is huge : both the data and the models are incomplete and error - prone .
Despite this , weather forecasting has come a long way over the past few decades .
Through a daily process of generating forecasts , comparing them with what happened , and thinking about how to reduce errors , we have incredibly accurate 1 - and 3 - day temperature forecasts .
Accurate forecasts of rain , snow , and so on for a specific location is a little harder because of the chance that the rainfall will be in a slightly different place ( e.g a few kilometers away ) or a slightly different time than the model forecasts , even if the overall amount of precipitation is right .
Hence , daily forecasts give fairly precise temperatures , but put probabilistic values on things like rain ( Probability of Precipitation , PoP ) , based on knowledge of the uncertainty factors in the forecast .
The probabilities are known because we have a huge body of previous forecasts to compare with .
The limit on useful weather forecasts seems to be about one week .
There are inaccuracies and missing information in the inputs , and the models are only approximations of the real physical processes .
Hence , the whole process is error prone .
At first these errors tend to be localized , which means the forecast for the short term ( a few days ) might be wrong in places , but is good enough in most of the region we ’re interested in to be useful .
But the longer we run the simulation for , the more these errors multiply , until they dominate the computation .
At this point , running the simulation for longer is useless .
1 - day forecasts are much more accurate than 3 - day forecasts , which are better than 5 - day forecasts , and beyond that it ’s not much better than guessing .
However , steady improvements mean that 3 - day forecasts are now as accurate as 2 - day forecasts were a decade ago .
Weather forecasting centres are very serious about reviewing the accuracy of their forecasts , and set themselves annual targets for accuracy improvements .
A number of things help in this process of steadily improving forecasting accuracy .
Improvements to the models help , as we get better and better at simulating physical processes in the atmosphere and oceans .
Advances in high performance computing help too – faster supercomputers mean we can run the models at a higher resolution , which means we get more detail about where exactly energy ( heat ) and mass ( winds , waves ) are moving .
But all of these improvements are dwarfed by the improvements we get from better data gathering .
If we had more accurate data on current conditions , and could get it into the models faster , we could get big improvements in the forecast quality .
In other words , weather forecasting is an “ initial value ” problem .
The biggest uncertainty is knowledge of the initial conditions .
One result of this is that weather forecasting centres ( like the UK Met Office ) can get an instant boost to forecasting accuracy whenever they upgrade to a faster supercomputer .
This is because the weather forecast needs to be delivered to a customer ( e.g. a newspaper or TV station ) by a fixed deadline .
If the models can be made to run faster , the start of the run can be delayed , giving the meteorologists more time to collect newer data on current conditions , and more time to process this data to correct for errors , and so on .
For this reason , the national weather forecasting services around the world operate many of the world ’s fastest supercomputers .
Hence weather forecasters are strongly biased towards data collection as the most important problem to tackle .
They tend to regard computer models as useful , but of secondary importance to data gathering .
Of course , I ’m generalizing – developing the models is also a part of meteorology , and some meteorologists devote themselves to modeling , coming up with new numerical algorithms , faster implementations , and better ways of capturing the physics .
It ’s quite a specialized subfield .
Climate science has the opposite problem .
Using pretty much the same model as for numerical weather prediction , climate scientists will run the model for years , decades or even centuries of simulation time .
After the first few days of simulation , the similarity to any actual weather conditions disappears .
But over the long term , day - to - day and season - to - season variability in the weather is constrained by the overall climate .
We sometimes describe climate as “ average weather over a long period ” , but in reality it is the other way round – the climate constrains what kinds of weather we get .
For understanding climate , we no longer need to worry about the initial values , we have to worry about the boundary values .
These are the conditions that constraint the climate over the long term : the amount of energy received from the sun , the amount of energy radiated back into space from the earth , the amount of energy absorbed or emitted from oceans and land surfaces , and so on .
If we get these boundary conditions right , we can simulate the earth ’s climate for centuries , no matter what the initial conditions are .
The weather itself is a chaotic system , but it operates within boundaries that keep the long term averages stable .
Of course , a particularly weird choice of initial conditions will make the model behave strangely for a while , at the start of a simulation .
But if the boundary conditions are right , eventually the simulation will settle down into a stable climate .
( This effect is well known in chaos theory : the butterfly effect expresses the idea that the system is very sensitive to initial conditions , and attractors are what cause a chaotic system to exhibit a stable pattern over the long term )
To handle this potential for initial instability , climate modellers create “ spin - up ” runs : pick some starting state , run the model for say 30 years of simulation , until it has settled down to a stable climate , and then use the state at the end of the spin - up run as the starting point for science experiments .
In other words , the starting state for a climate model does n’t have to match real weather conditions at all ; it just has to be a plausible state within the bounds of the particular climate conditions we ’re simulating .
To explore the role of these boundary values on climate , we need to know whether a particular combination of boundary conditions keep the climate stable , or tend to change it .
Conditions that tend to change it are known as forcings .
But the impact of these forcings can be complicated to assess because of feedbacks .
Feedbacks are responses to the forcings that then tend to amplify or diminish the change .
For example , increasing the input of solar energy to the earth would be a forcing .
If this then led to more evaporation from the oceans , causing increased cloud cover , this could be a feedback , because clouds have a number of effects : they reflect more sunlight back into space ( because they are whiter than the land and ocean surfaces they cover ) and they trap more of the surface heat ( because water vapour is a strong greenhouse gas ) .
The first of these is a negative feedback ( it reduces the surface warming from increased solar input ) and the second is a positive feedback ( it increases the surface warming by trapping heat ) .
To determine the overall effect , we need to set the boundary conditions to match what we know from observational data ( e.g. from detailed measurements of solar input , measurements of greenhouse gases , etc ) .
Then we run the model and see what happens .
Observational data is again important , but this time for making sure we get the boundary values right , rather than the initial values .
Which means we need different kinds of data too – in particular , longer term trends rather than instantaneous snapshots .
But this time , errors in the data are dwarfed by errors in the model .
If the algorithms are off even by a tiny amount , the simulation will drift over a long climate run , and it stops resembling the earth ’s actual climate .
For example , a tiny error in calculating where the mass of air leaving one grid square goes could mean we lose a tiny bit of mass on each time step .
For a weather forecast , the error is so small we can ignore it .
But over a century long climate run , we might end up with no atmosphere left !
So a basic test for climate models is that they conserve mass and energy over each timestep .
Climate models have also improved in accuracy steadily over the last few decades .
We can now use the known forcings over the last century to obtain a simulation that tracks the temperature record amazingly well .
These simulations demonstrate the point nicely .
They do n’t correspond to any actual weather , but show patterns in both small and large scale weather systems that mimic what the planet ’s weather systems actually do over the year ( look at August – see the the daily bursts of rainfall in the Amazon , the gulf stream sending rain to the UK all summer long , and the cyclones forming off the coast of Japan by the middle of the month ) .
And these patterns are n’t programmed into the model – it is all driven by sets of equations derived from the basic physics .
This is n’t a weather forecast , because on any given day , the actual weather wo n’t look anything like this .
But it is an accurate simulation of typical weather over time ( i.e. climate ) .
And , as was the case with weather forecasts , some bits are better than others – for example the Indian monsoons tend to be less well - captured than the North Atlantic Oscillation .
At first sight , numerical weather prediction and climate models look very similar .
They model the same phenomena ( e.g. how energy moves around the planet via airflows in the atmosphere and currents in the ocean ) , using the same computational techniques ( e.g. , three dimensional models of fluid flow on a rotating sphere ) .
And quite often they use the same program code .
But the problems are completely different : one is an initial value problem , and one is a boundary value problem .
Which also partly explains why a small minority of ( mostly older , mostly male ) meteorologists end up being climate change denialists .
They fail to understand the difference in the two problems , and think that climate scientists are misusing the models .
They know that the initial value problem puts serious limits on our ability to predict the weather , and assume the same limit must prevent the models being used for studying climate .
Their experience tells them that weaknesses in our ability to get detailed , accurate , and up - to - date data about current conditions is the limiting factor for weather forecasting , and they assume this limitation must be true of climate simulations too .
Ultimately , such people tend to suffer from “ senior scientist ” syndrome : a lifetime of immersion in their field gives them tremendous expertise in that field , which in turn causes them to over - estimate how well their expertise transfers to a related field .
They can become so heavily invested in a particular scientific paradigm that they fail to understand that a different approach is needed for different problem types .
This is n’t the same as the Dunning - Kruger effect , because the people I ’m talking about are n’t incompetent .
So perhaps we need a new name .
I ’m going to call it the Dyson - effect , after one of it ’s worst sufferers .
I should clarify that I ’m certainly not stating that meteorologists in general suffer from this problem ( the vast majority quite clearly do n’t ) , nor am I claiming this is the only reason why a meteorologist might be skeptical of climate research .
Nor am I claiming that any specific meteorologists ( or physicists such as Dyson ) do n’t understand the difference between initial value and boundary value problems .
However , I do think that some scientists ’ ideological beliefs tend to bias them to be dismissive of climate science because they do n’t like the societal implications , and the Dyson - effect disinclines them to finding out what climate science actually does .
I am , however , arguing that if more people understood this distinction between the two types of problem , we could get past silly soundbites about “ we ca n’t even forecast the weather … ” and “ climate models are garbage in garbage out ” , and have a serious conversation about how climate science works .
Update : Zeke has a more detailed post on the role of parameterizations climate models .

Psychotherapy is full of both extraordinary potential benefits and some possible pitfalls .
We ’ve discussed some of those things in past entries .
But there are some things in psychotherapy that you just should n’t spend too much time worrying about .
They may seem important or worth worrying about , but it ’s just a waste of your time , energy and focus .
Here ’s a few of them .
1 . My therapist is judging me .
A lot of patients spend a lot of time worrying about what their therapist must think of them .
That ’s because you spend a lot of time sharing deep , emotional and personal stuff in therapy .
Some of it may be embarrassing , or some of it may simply be out of the mainstream .
Some of it may be things that happened to you as a child , that you had no control of .
No matter what it is , you should n’t worry that your therapist is judging you .
Believe it or not , most psychotherapists have seen and heard a lot of things in their careers .
No matter what your story may be , it ’s likely they ’ve heard or seen worse .
One of the responsibilities and skills of a good therapist is to remain nonjudgmental , no matter their own personal reactions or feelings .
Therapists who act or talk in a judgmental manner should be avoided .
2. Sometimes I just do n’t know what to say or talk about .
You ’re not alone .
Virtually anyone who ’s tried therapy has experienced a session where they feel hard pressed to come up with a topic to discuss .
Some people — and some therapists — try and fill the void with small talk , or socializing .
While this is fine if it happens on occasion , it should never be the focus of an entire session ( or any significant portion of a session ) .
Silence is okay .
Silence may be awkward at first , but it ’s okay .
While not every session should be full of many minutes of passing silence , it ’s okay to sit quietly while you try and compose your thoughts .
It ’s also okay to not know what to talk about every session .
That ’s a normal and natural part of most psychotherapy .
A good therapist will help you through this part , and in any case , it ’s not something that should cause you much concern .
3 . I ’m not interesting enough — my therapist must be bored !
You do n’t enter psychotherapy to entertain your therapist .
While some people may believe they should have “ interesting ” things to talk about every session , that ’s just not a realistic expectation — nor one that your therapist holds .
You are there to get help for a specific mental health or relationship problem .
Sometimes the conversations you ’ll need to engage in to resolve that problem may not be very interesting .
But they are all important , and you should recognize that “ entertainment value ” is not usually high on the list of the reasons psychotherapists enter the profession .
4 . Should I know how this works ?
Should I feel the changes as they take place ?
Psychotherapy is not like medications .
You take an aspirin for a headache and the headache goes away .
You go to a session of psychotherapy and you do n’t immediately feel your pain relieved , your depression disappear , or your anxiety take a hike .
Psychotherapy takes longer , and sometimes it ’s hard to be patient , week after week of sessions .
You wo n’t know exactly how therapy works or when the changes will take place , as they will take place gradually , often in subtle ways .
You may not feel them the same way you feel relief from a headache .
You should n’t worry too much about this , as the process simply takes time and patience .
5 . My therapist watches the clock .
Your therapist wears many hats , and one of those is as a small business person .
Their commodity is time , and you ’re paying for a portion of that commodity .
Your therapist may indeed check the clock once in awhile because it ’s in their best interests to do so and end your session on time .
But surprisingly , it ’s also in your best interests , too .
By keeping your sessions on schedule , your therapist is also demonstrating and keeping good boundaries .
The ability to keep good therapeutic boundaries is one of the indicators of a good therapist — someone who ’s more likely able to help you .
So do n’t be too concerned or worried if you catch your therapist glancing at the clock .
It may be a little distracting , but it does n’t mean your therapist cares any less about you .
They ’re just keeping the relationship professional and focused .
5 Things Not to Worry About in Therapy

Kate Gosselin Starts the Year with a 20 - Hour Salon Makeover
Celebrating her new found freedom , reality TV star and divorcee Kate Gosselin spent 20 hours with celebrity hairstylist Ted Gibson for a new hairdo .
The makeover lasted until the wee hours .
Gibson added hundreds of extensions in Gosselin ’s hair .
“ Bonding extensions to those little hairs really took time .
But in all those hours , she did n’t complain once .
She was so open to whatever I suggested , and willing to try just about anything , ” said the hairstylist who is also a star in the show What Not To Wear .
He had previously styled the hairs of Angelina Jolie and Anne Hathaway .
There is an exception to the changes however .
The mom of eight kids does not want to let go of her “ trademark ” thick , jaw - length shock of hair in the front in favor of the bangs .
She refused to let it go at first in favor of bangs .
She later gave in .
The new look will be featured in the upcoming issue of People magazine this Friday , January 8 .

Christmas will stretch into 2010 for apartment renters , who are benefiting from an epic collapse in the rental market and generous concessions .
Landlords are offering tenants up to six months of free rent , flat - screen TVs and new appliances .
They 're also slashing monthly rates and easing application standards .
Rents fell a record 3.5 % in 2009 after factoring in freebies , according to MPF Research .
MPF projects prices will fall an additional 2 % next year as an improving housing market and a tax credit for first - time home buyers attract more renters .
" I 've been at this 35 years , and it's by far the worst I 've seen it , " says Jeff Cronrod of the American Apartment Owners Association .
Nationwide , apartment vacancy is 7.8 % , up from 4.8 % at the end of 2007 , says MPF Vice President Greg Willett .
The soft market is mostly rooted in the nation 's 10 % jobless rate .
Tenants who lose their jobs are moving in with relatives or finding roommates , says economist Lawrence Yun of the National Association of Realtors .
Also , homeowners who want to move but can't sell their houses because they 're worth less than their mortgages are renting them out instead .
So are investors who snapped up recently foreclosed houses and condos and are waiting for the market to rebound before unloading them .
Those units boost supply and dampen prices , economists say .
Among efforts to draw tenants : • In the Charleston , S.C. , area , Darby Development , which manages about 1,600 apartments , is offering up to two months of free rent , flat - screen TVs and $ 100 gasoline gift cards to new tenants , says Victoria Cowart , head of property management .
Existing tenants can get big discounts off the first month 's rent in a new lease .
" We 're just trying to be a little unique , " she says , noting vacancy at the complexes exceeds 20 % .
• In Tampa and Orlando , Blue Rock Partners is haggling a bit with tenants , shaving rent to beat rivals , says managing partner Reuven Oded .
• In Seattle , Trinity Partnership , owner of 1,000 apartments , built a 24 - seat digital movie theater in a 99 - unit building it opened in May to stand out in a tough market .
• In New York City , Viking Management is paying brokers ' fees , typically equal to a month of rent , for new tenants , says manager Tom Caraccio .
Despite the efforts , more than 5 % of tenants skip out without paying back rent vs. a typical 2 % , says Bill Gray , who writes a blog , The Landlord Doctor .
About 3.6 % of landlords defaulted on their mortgages in the third quarter , up from 1.8 % in late 2008 , according to Real Estate Econometrics .

Michael Geist sez , " Reports from Costa Rica indicate that final approval of the Central American Free Trade Agreement with the United States is languishing in the Legislative Assembly due to concerns over the copyright provisions .
The CAFTA copyright provisions are similar to those found in the other major U.S. trade agreements concluded in recent years : DMCA - style protections , ISP liability , and copyright term extension are all part of the package .
In this case , it is the responses that are most noteworthy .
Within Costa Rica , the article reports that the copyright provisions in the trade treaty have set off a wave of student protests over what it means for education .
Meanwhile , health officials are concerned that the provisions on pharmaceutical products " would bankrupt the public health system . "
The response from the U.S. is important as well .
It is delaying market access to sugar from the developing country until the copyright reforms are in place .
Until that time , Costa Rican sugar producers will not be able to sell their product in the U.S. "
U.S. To Costa Rica : No Sugar Access Without Copyright Reform

C# Remove HTML
Tags Strip or remove HTML tags from strings with Regex .
Replace and char arrays .
Remove HTML tags .
A string contains HTML tags .
We want to remove those tags .
This is useful for displaying HTML in plain text and stripping formatting like bold and italics .
A Regex cannot handle all HTML documents .
An iterative solution , with a for - loop , may be best in many cases : always test methods .
Also :
A simple for - loop can be used to validate HTML to see if it is mostly correct ( whether its tags have correct syntax ) .
For can not handle all HTML documents .
An iterative solution , with a for - loop , may be best in many cases : always test methods .
Regex
First example .
Here is a class that tests 3 ways of removing HTML tags and their contents .
The methods process an HTML string and return new strings that have no HTML tags .
StripTagsRegex : This uses a static call to Regex .
Replace , and therefore the expression is not compiled .
Regex .
Replace Regex :
This specifies that all sequences matching < and > with any number of characters ( but the minimal number ) are removed .
StripTagsRegexCompiled :
The regular expression ( Regex ) object is stored in the static class .
RegexOptions .
Compiled StripTagsCharArray :
This method is an optimized , iterative method .
In most benchmarks , this method is faster than Regex .
Char Array
Here is a class that tests 3 ways of removing HTML tags and their contents .
The methods process an HTML string and return new strings that have no HTML tags .
C# program that removes HTML tags using System ; using System .
Text .
RegularExpressions ; class Program { static void Main ( ) { const string html = " < p> Hello < b> world </b>!</p> " ; Console.WriteLine( StripTagsRegex( html ) ) ; Console.WriteLine( StripTagsRegexCompiled ( html ) ) ; Console.WriteLine( StripTagsCharArray( html ) ) ; } /// < summary > /// Remove HTML from string with Regex .
/// </summary > public static string StripTagsRegex ( string source ) { return Regex .
Replace ( source , " <.*?> " , string .
Empty ) ; } /// < summary > ///
Compiled regular expression for performance .
/// </summary > static Regex _htmlRegex = new Regex ( " <.*?> " , RegexOptions .
Compiled ) ; /// < summary > ///
Remove HTML from string with compiled Regex .
/// </summary > public static string StripTagsRegexCompiled ( string source ) { return _htmlRegex .Replace ( source , string .
Empty ) ; } /// < summary > ///
Remove HTML tags from string using char array .
/// </summary > public static string StripTagsCharArray ( string source ) { char [ ] array = new char [ source .
Length ] ; int array Index = 0 ; bool inside = false ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < source .
Length ; i++) { char let = source [ i ] ; if ( let == ' < ' ) { inside = true ; continue ; } if ( let == '> ' ) { inside = false ; continue ; } if ( ! inside ) { array [ array Index ] = let ; array Index ++ ; } } return new string ( array , 0 , arrayIndex ) ; } } Output Hello world !
Hello world !
Hello world !
A benchmark .
Regular expressions are usually not the fastest way to process text .
Char arrays and the string constructor can be used instead — this often performs better .
Version 1 : This version of the code removes the HTML from the generated string returned by GetHtml ( ) .
Version 2 : Here we do the same thing as version 2 , but use a compiled regular expression for a performance boost .
Version 3 : Here we use a char- array method that loops and tests characters , appending to a buffer as it goes along .
Result :
The char array method was considerably faster .
In 2020 , using a char array is still a good choice .
Regular expressions are usually not the fastest way to process text .

Self - closing .
In XHTML , some elements have no separate closing tag , and instead use the " /> " at the end of the first tag .
The methods tested on this page correctly handle self - closing tags .
Next :
Here are some HTML tags supported .
Invalid tags may not work in the Regex methods .
In XHTML , some elements have no separate closing tag , and instead use the " /> " at the end of the first tag .
The methods tested on this page correctly handle self - closing tags .
Supported tags : < img src= " " /> < img src= " " /> < br /> < br/> < div > <!-- -->
Validate HTML .
Here is a way to validate XHTML using methods similar to StripTagsCharArray .
We count the number of < and > tags and make sure the counts match .
Also :
We can run the Regex methods and then look for < > characters that are still present .
Further :
There are ways to use more complete validation .
An HTML parser can be made very complex .
Important : Because of how HTML works , having unescaped angle brackets is potentially very harmful to a website layout .
Here is a way to validate XHTML using methods similar to StripTagsCharArray .
We count the number of < and > tags and make sure the counts match .
C# program that validates brackets using System ; class Program { static void Main ( ) { //
Test the IsValid method .
Console .
WriteLine ( HtmlUtil. IsValid ( " < html > < head ></head ></html > " ) ) ; Console.WriteLine( HtmlUtil.IsValid( " < html< head < head < html " ) ) ; Console.WriteLine( HtmlUtil.IsValid( " < a href=y >x </a > " ) ) ; Console.WriteLine( HtmlUtil.IsValid( " <<>> " ) ) ; Console.WriteLine( HtmlUtil.IsValid ( " " ) ) ; } } static class HtmlUtil { enum TagType { SmallerThan , // < GreaterThan // > } public static bool IsValid ( string html ) { TagType expected = TagType.SmallerThan ; //
Must start with < for ( int i = 0 ; i < html .
Length ; i++) //
Loop { bool smallerThan = html [ i ] == ' < ' ; bool greaterThan = html [ i ] == '>' ; if (!smallerThan && !greaterThan ) // Common case { continue ; } if ( smallerThan && expected == TagType.SmallerThan ) //
If < and expected continue { expected = TagType.
GreaterThan ; continue ; } if ( greaterThan && expected == TagType. GreaterThan ) //
If > and expected continue { expected = TagType.SmallerThan ; continue ; } return false ; // Disallow } return expected == TagType.SmallerThan ; // Must expect < } } Output True False True False True
Note , comments .
The methods in this article may have problems with removing some comments .
Sometimes , comments contain invalid markup .
And :
This may result in comments being incompletely removed .
It might be necessary to scan for incorrect markup .
Caution :
The methods shown cannot handle all HTML documents .
Please be careful when using them .
The methods in this article may have problems with removing some comments .
Sometimes , comments contain invalid markup .
Notes , char arrays .
One method ( StripTagsCharArray ) uses char arrays .
It is much faster than the other 2 methods .
It uses an algorithm for parsing the HTML .
Algorithm :
It iterates through all characters , flipping a flag Boolean depending on whether it is inside a tag block .
And :
It only adds a char to the array if it is not a tag .
It uses char arrays and the string constructor .
String Constructor StringBuilder : Char arrays are faster than using StringBuilder .
But StringBuilder can be used with similar results .
One method ( StripTagsCharArray ) uses char arrays .
It is much faster than the other 2 methods .
It uses an algorithm for parsing the HTML .
A summary .
Several methods can strip HTML tags from strings or files .
These methods have the same results on the input .
But the iterative method is faster in the test here .

At the close of trading Thursday , Microsoft announced the results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2010 , which ended December 31 , 2009 .
Revenue of $ 19.02 billion , a 14 percent increase from the same period of the prior year , set a new a record for the company .
The three other financial measures — operating income ( $ 8.51 billion ) , net income ( $ 6.66 billion ) , and earnings per share ( $ 0.74 ) — all were up year - over - year , 43 percent , 60 percent , and 57 percent , respectively .
So what is Microsoft 's explanation for the positive growth across the board ?
Its latest client operating system .
" Exceptional demand for Windows 7 led to the positive top - line growth for the company , " said Peter Klein , chief financial officer at Microsoft .
Furthermore , the recession hit the holiday quarter pretty badly in 2008 , and while Redmond could not avoid it , its reaction in the form of various cuts is now paying off .
" Our continuing commitment to managing costs allowed us to drive earnings performance ahead of the revenue growth . "
Microsoft revealed that it had sold over 60 million Windows 7 licenses through the second quarter ( which would explain the huge growth we 're seeing in market share numbers ) .
This not only made it a record quarter for Windows units in general , but it makes Windows 7 the fastest selling operating system in history .
When discussing the results from two quarters ago , Microsoft said it would defer some $ 275 million of revenue from prepaid upgrades to Windows 7 .
Microsoft actually ended up deferring $ 1.71 billion in revenue , which is about $ 0.14 of diluted earnings per share , relating to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option Program and presales of Windows 7 to OEMs and retailers before general availability .
Taking that number into consideration , the revenue would actually total $ 17.31 billion , or about $ 0.60 per share .
Microsoft will be discussing second quarter results and the company 's business outlook on a conference call and webcast , which we are liveblogging .

The Dynamic Tower ( also known as Dynamic Architecture Building or the Da Vinci Tower ) is a proposed 420 - metre 80 - floor tower in Dubai , United Arab Emirates .
The tower is expected to be architecturally innovative for several reasons : Uniquely , each floor will be able to rotate independently .
This will result in a constantly changing shape of the tower .
Each floor will rotate a maximum of 6 metres per minute , or one full rotation in 90 minutes .
It will also be the world ’s first prefabricated skyscraper with 40 factory - built modules for each floor .
90 % of the tower will be built in a factory and shipped to the construction site .
This will allow the entire building to be built in only 22 months .
The only part of the tower that will be built at the construction site will be the core .
Part of this prefabrication will be the decrease in cost and number of workers ( 90 instead of 2,000 needed ) .
The total construction time will be more than 30 % less than a normal skyscraper of the same size .
The majority of the workers will be in factories , where it will be much safer .
The modules will be preinstalled including kitchen and bathroom fixtures .
The core will serve each floor with a special , patented connection for clean water , based on technology used to refuel airplanes in mid-flight .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - The U.S. economic recession has taken a particularly heavy toll on young Americans , with a record one out five black men aged 20 to 24 neither working nor in school , according to research released on Tuesday .
People talk to job recruiters at a career fair in Los Angeles , February 3 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Lucy Nicholson
Teenagers have found it significantly harder to get a job since the recession began in late 2007 , with black youths and young people from low - income families faring the worst , wrote Andrew Sum of Northeastern University in Boston , a employment researcher commissioned by the Chicago Urban League and the Alternative Schools Network .
“ Low - income and minority youth , who depended on part - time jobs as a significant stepping stone to future employment , have been forced out of the job market and economically marginalized , ” Herman Brewer of the Chicago Urban League said in a statement .
Overall , 26 percent of American teenagers aged 16 to 19 had jobs in late 2009 , said the report , which was based on U.S. Census Bureau data .
That figure is a record low since statistics began to be kept in 1948 , the researchers said .
Employment counts the number of people with a job as a percentage of the entire work force .
By contrast , the unemployment rate -- which stood at 10 percent in December in the United States -- does not include people who have grown discouraged and stopped looking for work .
Joblessness was particularly rife among high school dropouts aged 16 to 24 who were neither in school nor holding a job , the report said .
Family income also had a influence on joblessness .
Only 13 percent of low - income black teenagers in Illinois held a job in 2008 compared with 48 percent of more affluent white , non-Hispanic teens .
The “ disconnection rate ” -- Americans aged 20 to 24 who were neither in school nor working -- jumped to 28 percent last year from 17 percent in 2007 .
“ If you included those in prison it would be a couple of points higher , ” the report ’s co-author Joseph McLaughlin of Northeastern .
Among the proposals the report supported were government - funded jobs programs directed at the young , additional funding to help re-enroll school dropouts , and government - funded expansions of work internships .

JANUARY 14-- Scott Ritter , the controversial former chief U.N. weapons inspector and fierce Bush administration critic , is facing sexual exploitation of children charges after he was caught in an Internet sting .
According to court records , Ritter , 48 , engaged in a sexually explicit online chat with what he thought was a 15 - year - old girl named Emily ( but in fact was an undercover detective with the Barrett Township Police Department in Pennsylvania ) .
A probable cause affidavit notes that Ritter told " Emily " that we was " fantasizing about fucking you " and sent her a link to his web cam .
" The web camera showed him masturbating again and then ejaculating , " reported Detective Ryan Venneman . "
Ritter was charged late last year with unlawful contact with a minor , criminal solicitation , and indecent exposure , among other felony and misdemeanor counts .
Ritter , who lives near Albany , N.Y. , was caught in the sting last February .
According to previous press reports , Ritter , pictured in the mug shot at left , was twice previously snared in similar undercover online investigations .
In one of those cases , Ritter was charged with attempted child endangerment after arranging to rendezvous at a Burger King with a 16 - year - old girl he had met in an online chat room ( the teen turned out to be an undercover policewoman ) .
That 2001 case , details of which have been sealed , was dismissed after Ritter stayed out of trouble for a prescribed period of time .
He is currently free on $ 25,000 unsecured bail and has waived his right to a preliminary hearing .

Hanford Nuclear Site , Washington ( CNN ) --
The federal government has set aside nearly $ 2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington state 's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site , once the center of the country 's Cold War plutonium production .
That is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received , which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent .
The facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south - central Washington , an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island .
It was built in the 1940s as part of the " Manhattan Project " to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II .
Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built .
During the Cold War , Hanford became a main source of plutonium production for the nation 's nuclear weapons program .
Decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being one of the most contaminated nuclear sites in the Western Hemisphere .
Today , the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town , and those involved in the cleanup say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds .
There are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater , hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge .
The stimulus money will reduce the cleanup time by years , according to Jon Peschong , who oversees the federal project at Hanford .
" It was perfect work , ready to go for the stimulus package , " Peschong said .
" Each day that passes the conditions worsen [ and ] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the cleanup footprint much sooner , years sooner . "
The money has also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford , including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation .
Despite the dangers of his job , Gill said it came just at the right time .
" I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world , [ I ] thought I 'd be there for 20 years , " Gill said .
" We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant , [ and ] those jobs are n't jobs you just read the paper and get . "
Hanford wo n't be decontaminated quickly .
The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear .
They break down contaminated equipment through a " glove box , " allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead - lined gloves .
Each time a worker removes the gloves , a colleague must check for radiation exposure .
The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford .
A report by Sens. John McCain , R - Arizona , and Tom Coburn , R - Oklahoma , listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted .
The Hanford cleanup " has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress , " according to the report .
Gerry Pollet , who runs a Hanford watchdog organization , says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste .
But he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed .
" You are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the cleanup and the environment , " said Pollet , who heads Heart of America Northwest .
" They are picking the low - hanging fruit , the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities .
But that does n't cost $ 2 billion .
" Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds , and you would expect to see real progress for cleanup [ to ] happen with those dollars . "
While debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used , the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland , Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the cleanup boom .
Hanford began receiving stimulus dollars in March 2009 , which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn .
The Tri-Cities area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Washington , and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn , according to the Tri-Cities Industrial Development Council .
Ken Brutzman , who owns a local office furniture store , said his business was " at a standstill " last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in .
Brutzman had to hire six temporary workers , two of which he may keep on full time , to deal with the boom in business .
" We are on track to have the best year ever , " Brutzman said .
His business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable since the Hanford cleanup project is expected to take another 40 years .
" It has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying , ' Wow how does that guy do that ? ' "
As many people know , reuse is a step up from recycling .
In fact , reuse is the middle - man between reduce and recycle , and some would be surprised at how many opportunities for reuse there really are – once you start looking for them .
We ’re not talking about simply covering a bottle in magazine cut-outs , sticking some flowers inside and voilà – a masterpiece vase is born .
There ’s more to it .
Though there is always room for easy and fun projects , the reuse that we find most interesting is the kind you ca n’t tell is reused .
There are some quality results that can be achieved , and just like we learned with T - shirts , many products have a lot of reuse potential .
These are our eight creative ways ( with a why and how mixed in ) to reuse plastic , in all of its forms :
1. Getting Every Drop : Plastic Bottles
These little puppies are everywhere .
In fact , they are a valuable part of most U.S. communities ’ recycling stream since PET ( # 1 ) and HDPE ( # 2 ) make up 96 percent of all plastic bottles produced in the U.S. Since 1977 , when the first PET bottle was recycled , plastic bottle recycling has increased to more than 2.3 billion pounds annually .
Today , more than 80 percent of communities collect plastic bottles .
So , recycling this product is most likely a common practice for most .
But if you shoot for more long - term reuse projects , it can definitely be worth it .
When Alaska 's Kasatochi Volcano erupted on Aug. 7 , 2008 , it virtually sterilized Kasatochi Island , covering the small Aleutian island with a layer of ash and other volcanic material several meters thick .
The eruption also provided a rare research opportunity : the chance to see how an ecosystem develops from the very first species to colonize the island .
Next week , a team of researchers organized by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will visit Kasatochi to look for signs of life on the island , almost exactly one year after the catastrophic eruption .
The interdisciplinary research team will spend four days ( Aug. 10 - 13 ) surveying the island , using the USFWS research vessel Tiglax as an operational base for the on -site research .
" Since volcanism plays such a big role in shaping the Aleutians , we hope to end up with a better understanding of how disturbances such as volcanic eruptions shape the ecology of these islands , " says Tony DeGange , a USGS biologist and one of the research team coordinators .
" There has n't been a study quite like this done in Alaska where scientists are taking such a comprehensive ecological view of the impact of an eruption and its resulting response and recovery . "
Researchers expect that insects and birds will be the first animal species that recolonize the island .
In preparation for the August survey , biologists set up monitoring and sampling equipment on Kasatochi earlier this summer , including insect traps for Derek Sikes , curator of insects at the University of Alaska Museum of the North .
Sikes visited Kasatochi in June 2008 for a one - day survey of the insect fauna on the island before the eruption .
He will be part of the research team that visits the island next week .
" Work in similar systems shows that flying - and wind - borne insects and spiders form a fairly constant rain during the summer months , " says Sikes , adding that some of these species survive by preying or scavenging on other arthropods .
" We 'll be looking for spiders , which are all predators , and ground beetles , which are mostly predators , as well as other species associated with bird droppings or vertebrate carrion . "
An opportunity like this is extremely rare , according to Sikes .
The most comparable example is the emergence of Surtsey Island off the coast of Iceland in 1963 , when undersea volcanic eruptions reached the surface .
That island was declared a United Nations World Heritage Site for its role as a pristine natural laboratory .
Even today , access to Surtsey remains restricted to a small number of researchers each year who study the species that have colonized the island over the past 40 years .
According to the USFWS , the Kasatochi study is unique in that it takes place in an isolated marine ecosystem for which there are pre-eruption ecological data for the island and its nearby marine waters , including data from the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge dating from the mid-1990s and from Sikes ' 2008 field work on the island .
This summer 's work is funded by the North Pacific Research Board , USGS and USFWS .
According to DeGange , it is expected to be the first phase of a long - term ecological study .
Google Under Attack The High Cost of Doing Business in China
The recent cyber attack on Google reveals a lot about doing business in China , where attempted hacking and restrictive regulations are part of everyday life for Western companies .
Now the Internet giant is fighting back , but other firms are likely to keep a low profile .
The Times raises two objections in its Jan. 13 editorial , “ Legalize pot ?
Not so fast , ” to a proposed state bill that would legalize , tax and regulate the sale of marijuana to adults 21 and older .
First , the editorial claims that the purpose of AB 390 is “ simply ” to raise tax revenue for the state .
This alone , The Times says , does not justify what it calls “ rash and reckless ” public policy .
Second ,
The Times writes that California “ does not have the authority to take such a step . ”
Both assertions miss the mark .
There are plenty of reasons to support AB 390 apart from the estimated $ 1.3 billon it would add to the state ’s coffers .
It would allow law enforcement the time and resources to actually prioritize public safety .
In the last 20 years , while arrests for all criminal offenses in California dropped by 40 % , arrests for marijuana possession have more than doubled .
These arrests ( about 78,000 occurred in 2008 alone ) constitute a waste of precious resources that could have been spent protecting Californians from violent crime .
AB 390 would also rectify the discriminatory enforcement of California ’s drug laws .
African Americans make up about 7 % of the population in California , and , according to federal government statistics , they do not use marijuana at a higher rate than whites do .
Yet of those arrested for marijuana offenses in California , nearly one - fourth are African Americans .
Children would also find it more difficult to buy marijuana under AB 390 .
Currently , kids can -- and do -- easily obtain marijuana illegally without anyone checking ID .
The state ’s existing marijuana laws are an example of destructive and reactionary public policy .
They are largely responsible for the horrific drug- related violence in both California and along our border with Mexico .
Thankfully , we are n’t stuck with this destructive marijuana policy .
The Times is simply wrong to suggest that California does not have the authority to tax and regulate marijuana .
There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that requires states to criminalize anything .
We could scrap our entire penal code tomorrow if we wanted to .
States get to decide state law , not Washington .
This is why California and 13 other states have been able to legalize and regulate medical marijuana despite continuing federal prohibition .
Certainly , even if AB 390 becomes law , the federal government could still enforce its marijuana laws against California residents .
The reality is , however , the federal government does not have the resources to undertake sole -- or even primary -- enforcement responsibility for state drug crimes .
More than 95 % of all marijuana arrests in this country are made by state and local law enforcement agencies .
And despite Washington ’s active hostility to medical marijuana laws , state programs have thrived .
The vast majority of patients using medical marijuana have received no threats of interference from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
And tellingly , the federal government has not sought to strike down a single state law in court because there is no legal basis for doing so .
It simply does n’t have the resources or political will to carry out large numbers of arrests and federal prosecutions .
Congress has allowed the states much discretion in legislating their own drug policies .
The states do not need to march in lock - step with the federal government .
California is free to choose a smarter marijuana control policy -- and that ’s exactly what AB 390 is .

One year after the massacre in Gaza , we the people of Gaza need your support to end the inhuman blockade .
This week marks one year since Israel began its attack on the Gaza Strip : a year since phosphorus bombs , dime bombs and other weapons of death and destruction were unleashed on a defenceless civilian population .
A year since the people of the world demanded that Israel end its attack on Gaza .
In this Israeli war of aggression on the occupied Gaza Strip , many of our civilians were massacred by Israel ’s indiscriminate bombing , condemned by UN experts and leading human rights organisations as war crimes and crimes against humanity .
This assault left over 1,440 Palestinians dead , predominantly civilians , of whom 431 were children .
Another 5,380 Palestinians were injured .
We , the 1.5 million Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip , the overwhelming majority of whom are refugees who were violently expelled from our homes by Zionist forces in 1948 , were subjected to three weeks of relentless Israeli state terror , whereby Israeli warplanes systematically targeted civilian areas , reduced whole neighbourhoods and vital civilian infrastructure to rubble and partially destroyed scores of schools , including several run by the UN , where civilians were taking shelter .
This came after 18 months of a crippling , deadly hermetic Israeli siege of Gaza , a severe form of collective punishment described by John Dugard , the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights as “ a prelude to genocide . ”
The war on Gaza was pre-medicated .
Matan Vilnai , ex-Deputy Defense Minister of Israel , told Army Radio during “ Operation Hot Winter ” ( 29 February 2008 ) : “ They will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah because we will use all our might to defend ourselves . ”
In the days following this statement , 107 Palestinians , including 28 children , were killed .
The international community failed to take action .
This inaction , served as a green light for the atrocities in January 2009 .
But the attack on Gaza is not yet over : we , the Palestinians of Gaza are still living with our physical , mental and emotional wounds .
Our bodies cannot heal because the medicine that we require is not allowed into the Gaza Strip .
Our homes cannot be rebuilt and the mangled steel and concrete cannot be removed because the trucks and bulldozers that can remove them are not allowed into Gaza .
Never before has a population been denied the basic requirements for survival as a deliberate policy of colonisation , occupation and apartheid , but this is what Israel is doing to us , the people of Gaza , today : 1.5 million people live without a secure supply of water , food , electricity , medicines , with almost half of them being children under the age of 15 .
It is a slow genocide of the kind unparalleled in human history .
Earlier this month , Ronnie Kasrils , ex South African Intelligence Minister and member of the ANC , said in the UK that what Israel is doing to the Palestinians is far worse than what was done to black South Africans under apartheid .
And , former US president Jimmy Carter said that the Palestinian people trapped in Gaza are being treated “ like animals . ”
The people of Gaza need your support to end the blockade .
Over 1400 international activists from over 42 countries will be in Gaza on December 31 .
They will march with us to demand that Israel lift its ’ blockade of the Gaza Strip immediately and permanently .
We ask you to show your solidarity with Gaza on the same day : wherever you may be , organize a protest , a march or a petition collection in your own country .
There are 1.5 million people in Gaza : we want to see 1.5 million people around the world support us as we take our demands to the Israeli state .
We need you to show Israel that we have a common humanity ; that you watch what it does and you will not tolerate it because silence is complicity .
We need you to show Israel on December 31 2009 that there is no place for their kind of war mongering and barbarism in the world and that the people of the world reject it .
We need you to show us , the people of Gaza , that you remember the horror that we face each day , and that you are with us as we fight against the Israeli - apartheid killing machine .

A mother of four accused of torturing to death her partner today denied she had intended to murder him .
Clare Nicholls is alleged to have repeatedly punched , kicked , stamped on , whipped and burnt Andrew Gardner , the father of her youngest child .
Under cross-examination Nicholls , 28 , admitted she had attacked her partner , 35 , but denied she had tortured him to death .
Prosecutor Paul Sloan QC said she had told a pack of lies " from beginning to end " by repeatedly changing her story to play down her role in Mr Gardner 's death .
He suffered more than 100 separate injuries , including 21 fractured ribs , in the weeks leading up to his death on March 13 last year , Teesside Crown Court heard .
Nicholls , her brother Simon Nicholls , 24 , and her ex-partner Steven Martin , 44 , who lived together in Arthur Street , Chilton , County Durham , deny murder .
Yesterday Clare Nicholls admitted manslaughter , a plea not accepted by the prosecution .
Mr Sloan accused all three defendants of being involved in the final , fatal attack on Mr Gardner in the living room of the house they all shared in Arthur Street .
Nicholls maintained that on the day he died she had only punched him twice during a row .
" You accept that you told a pack of lies from beginning to end in all the police interviews , in both March and July ? " he asked .
" Pretending Andrew had left the house at about 8 pm , pretending he had been assaulted when he was out , returning to the house at about 11 pm .
" Complete pack of lies .
Pretending the assault occurred away from the house and that others must have been responsible .
" On that occasion , during the final attack , Andrew was pinned to the floor .
He was pinned to the floor by Simon and Steven .
" Simon had hold of his arms and Steven was pinning him down as well as punching him in the face .
" It was during this attack that you stamped on his already burnt foot , fracturing it .
" At the time of that attack he was already suffering from 21 rib fractures and it was obvious that he was in need of urgent medical attention .
" Your intention in carrying out that attack was to cause him really serious bodily injury . "
Breaking down in tears again to deny Mr Sloan 's accusation , Nicholls replied : " I do know one thing that I never wanted to see that man die . "
Mr Sloan continued : " You still cannot bring yourself to admit the true extent of what you did that night .
" You can not bring yourself to admit what your intention was because if you did you would be admitting murder . "
She replied : " I did not intend serious harm . "
Mr Sloan said Nicholls must have known that Mr Gardner was in excruciating pain in the days leading to his death because of the rib fractures .
" He already had six rib fractures .
He is then attacked again , the attack causing another 10 rib fractures , " Mr Sloan said .
" So when he is being jumped on , already having rib fractures , he must have been in excruciating pain .
" Miss Nicholls you caused him that excruciating pain because you jumped on him with your knee , a technique you used . "
Breaking down in tears , she replied : " I admit to jumping on him once on one occasion .
" The rest of his broken ribs would have been caused by my brother Simon .
I did not realise that my knee going into his ribs was going to cause him so much pain . "
Mr Sloan also accused Nicholls of " humiliating " Mr Gardner by having sex with Steven Martin in front of him as he lay on the living room floor suffering from fractured ribs .
The prosecutor accused Nicholls of encouraging her three eldest children to attack Mr Gardner .
" You even corrupted your own children .
They took their lead from you , " he told her .
" Not only were they encouraged to assault Andrew they told of your approval .
ATLANTA  The South has become the first region in the country where more than half of public school students are poor and more than half are members of minorities , according to a new report .
The shift was fueled not by white flight from public schools , which spiked during desegregation but has not had much effect on school demographics since the early 1980s .
Rather , an influx of Latinos and other ethnic groups , the return of blacks to the South and higher birth rates among black and Latino families have contributed to the change .
The new numbers , from the 2008 - 9 school year , are a milestone for the South , “ the only section of the United States where racial slavery , white supremacy and racial segregation of schools were enforced through law and social custom , ” said the report , to be released on Thursday by the Southern Education Foundation , a nonprofit group based here that supports education improvement in the region .
But the numbers also herald the future of the country as a whole , as minority students are expected to exceed 50 percent of public school enrollment by 2020 and the share of students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced - price lunches is on the rise in every state .
The South , desperate for a well - educated work force that can attract economic development , will face an enormous challenge in tackling on such a broad scale the lower achievement rates among poor and minority students , who score lower than average on tests and drop out more frequently than whites .
Four of the 15 states in the report  Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi and Texas  now have a majority of both low - income and minority pupils .
Only one , Virginia , has neither .
( CNN ) --
A man was arrested Monday after police found an arsenal of high - powered weapons and a map of a U.S. military base in his New Jersey hotel , authorities said .
Lloyd R. Woodson , 43 , was arrested and faces multiple weapons charges after an investigation into his suspicious behavior at a store in Branchburg , New Jersey , said local prosecutor Wayne J. Forrest .
Woodson , wearing a military jacket , went to a store called Quick Chek on Monday afternoon and was acting suspiciously , Forrest said in a statement .
The clerk called authorities .
When officers arrived , Woodson ran into the woods .
He was subdued after wrestling with officers , the statement said .
During the struggle , officers noticed that Woodson was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying an assault rifle in his coat .
Officers searched Woodson 's hotel room and found another assault rifle , a grenade launcher , a police scanner , another bulletproof vest , a map of a U.S. military base , hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a Middle Eastern - style headdress , the statement said .
I have observed that people go to great lengths to protect God in the face of human tragedy , small or large , never more so than in the face of natural disaster .
Such is the case with Haiti .
I hear many of us , especially among churchgoers , say to ourselves and to one another :
Whatever is , is God ’s will .
Or , God ’s reasons are inscrutable , though they will become clear to us , once we have joined God in the afterlife and see “ face to face . ”
Or God is teaching us a lesson through this event ; a greater good can come from this horrific moment .
Or suffering is a blessing , an opportunity to live as Christ lived .
Or suffering is a test that will temper us like the fires of steel , strengthening us in our faith .
In any case , what is required of us in response is to submit to the will of God , however ambiguous , hidden , or unclear .
While for some of us , God simply can’t sustain the weight of such protective measures , nor does God deserve such privileged treatment , for many of us the idea of challenging traditional conceptions of God is particularly unbearable in the face of suffering .
This is psychologically understandable .
That there might be no God , that God is ultimately indifferent to human suffering , that God is less than all powerful , that the events themselves challenge all attempts to find meaning — such possibilities are less likely to be entertained , because the very idea of meaninglessness , on the face of it , an oxymoron , is too painful to bear .
God , the source and center of all meaning for monotheists , must be protected at any cost .
Nevertheless , such atheistic and agnostic struggles often historically take place precisely in the face of disaster .
A more typical alternative , however , is to look for human responsibility and deserts in order that God and God ’s power might be secured .
This is especially the case for those of us steeped in scriptural traditions that emphasize a highly anthropomorphized , personalistic , moody , and mighty God , those of us who approach these texts “ literally . ”
So , for example , Pat Robertson , appearing on CBN , attributes the earthquake , along with a history of natural and social devastation in Haiti , to a slave revolt based on a “ pact with the devil . ”
He calls the earthquake an event that could be a blessing in disguise for the Haitian people , as he calls for repentance among the survivors — all of this moralizing taking place while a ticker tape appeal runs across the bottom of the TV screen for contributions for earthquake relief .
This tendency to blame the victims , however , is hardly restricted to the literalists among believers , be they Christian , Jewish , or Muslim .
Nor is it necessarily restricted to monotheists .
Where God or meaning per se is at stake , the point is in any case to protect .
These responses , whether protective or challenging , are hardly new .
One need only consider the Lisbon earthquake to see them play out with a strange familiarity regarding present circumstances .
Such a return to the past is sadly telling in relation to the present .
Lisbon : The End of Optimism ?
The Lisbon earthquake struck the capital of Portugal on November 1 , 1755 , All Saints ’ Day .
Scientists today speculate that it probably registered as a nine on the Richter scale .
It devastated the population .
Estimates of the number of people killed range from 10,000 to 100,000 .
At the time the quake struck , worshipers filled the churches honoring their dead .
The churches , the worshippers , and the city around them were effectively destroyed .
Not long after the major quake hit , a tsunami followed that killed those who had rushed to the beaches in fear to avoid the havoc of the earthquake .
The cataclysm haunted European literature , art , philosophy , and theology for decades .
The economy of Europe was subsequently affected for some time to come .
The significance of the catastrophe , especially its cause , weighed heavily on Europeans ’ minds .
That the event took place on a religious holiday , that it took out a major European capital , that the city was devoutly Catholic , all these aspects troubled ordinary people , philosophers , and clergy alike .
Issues of God ’s goodness in relation to God ’s power , as well as the ultimate goodness of this world as the best of all possible worlds because created , after all , by such a god , arose front and center .
Some clergy saw the earthquake as a signal for the end of the world .
A few philosophers asked for scientific causes .
( Immanuel Kant , for example , attributed the earthquake to underground caves filling with gases . )
Most folks found either of these approaches less than satisfactory .
Today some historians see the Lisbon earthquake as signaling the end of the optimism of the European Enlightenment and the beginning of the anxiety and emotional excessiveness of Romanticism .
“ If this is the best of all possible worlds , what are the others ? ”
Perhaps the best known response falls more into the category of challenging our very notions of God and God ’s world as the best of all possible worlds .
Voltaire ’s Candide : or Optimism presents its reader with a merciless , satirical attack on German philosopher Leibniz ’s notion that this world is the best possible world that God could have created , given that God is , after all , both benevolent and all powerful .
The central figure Candide , a naïf of the first order , challenges theodicy with the ironclad logic of a child as he proceeds through an adolescent life riddled by personal disaster .
Given human suffering ( particularly from natural disaster , and particularly the suffering of those who are not on the face of it evil ) , how can this possibly be the best of all worlds ?
And if this is the best of all worlds , what does this have to say about its creator ?
And if this is not the best of all possible worlds , and still God ’s creation is good , what does this have to say about its creator ?
In other words , if God is benevolent or good , how can God be all powerful , given human suffering ?
If God is all powerful , how can God possibly be benevolent or good , given the same circumstances ?
Candide challenged all philosophical attempts at theodicy as feeble and idiotic .
In the end , Candide , after much suffering himself and bereft of God , retires to cultivate his own garden .
This “ final resolution ” leaves important issues unaddressed , a point to which I shall shortly return ; needless to say , this non-theistic or atheistic view , however well known it may be , is not shared by most Americans .
“ Repent , the end of the world is at hand . ”
Less known are the clerical responses of the time , which were numerous .
Charles and John Wesley ( the latter considered the founder of the Methodist movement ) preached many sermons on the earthquake .
According to Methodist minister Ann Bracket , the Wesley brothers saw the Lisbon earthquake in terms of the biblically - preordained fate of the human race .
Their sermons and hymns drew upon the rich resources of Revelation , Mark 13 , and the earlier Hebrew prophets .
That the Lisbon earthquake was followed by a series of lesser earthquakes in and around London , as well as in New England , was further evidence that God ’s judgment was raining down on human sin and calling for a universal repentance , as the world drew to an end .
In regard to Lisbon , both shared the anti-Catholic perspective typical of Protestantism at the time ( and still lingering with us ) that Lisbon , a center for the Inquisition , was a hotbed of idolatry precisely in the very devotion of its inhabitants .
That it was a rich city surrounded by rural poverty only further confirmed the Wesley brothers ’ views .
Blaming the Victims
In spite of all caution against drawing parallels between past and present events , the resonances between Lisbon and Haiti are irresistible .
The idea that sin produces natural devastation reigns in the land of Pat Robertson .
The move to blame the victims is just too tempting .
Like the Wesleys before him , Robertson issues a call for repentance in the face of divine judgment .
Like the Wesleys in their anti-Catholicism , Pat Robertson reads history through a lens of religious bias that interprets all practices and beliefs that he does not share as a pact with the devil , or in the case of the Wesleys , idolatry ; in either case the result is the same — blame the victims .
The material conditions of real Haitians and their history as a slave colony never intervene in the face of bad theology .
And here story of the two catastrophes differs drastically .
In fact , between 1793 and 1801 the people we now call Haitian pulled off a successful slave revolt against nothing less than the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte .
On an August evening in 1791 , either before or during the revolution ( depending on when you date the revolution ’s beginning ) , slaves performed a voodoo rite , Robertson ’s “ pact with the devil . ”
That the dominant tradition existing alongside Voodoo is Catholicism implicitly buttresses Robertson ’s case .
As for the actual events , however : though slave revolts occurred often throughout the colonies in both Americas , the one that liberated Haiti is the only one to have succeeded .
Its success elicited terror among colonialists in Europe and the Americas alike .
To forestall possible contact with their own slave populations , colonialists imposed embargoes on Haiti , some of which lasted well into the nineteenth century .
The very success of the revolution produced a punishment by all surrounding colonies and territories worse and longer - lasting than the US embargo against Cuba .
The unilateral and widespread embargo thwarted recovery and development for close to a century .
Prior to the revolt French - ruled Saint - Domingue - now - Haiti was stripped of its natural resources by French occupation .
Subsequent to the embargoes , in the early twentieth century , Haiti suffered invasion and occupation by this country at the expense of development on its own terms .
All of these conditions — French plundering , colonial and European embargo , and US occupation — produced long - lasting and incomparable poverty and corruption .
( The national media keep referring to the poverty but fail to address the history of its production . )
Self - Cultivation and the Ethical Imperative
Voltaire ’s resolution to the issues posed by suffering , as manifested through the character of Candide , are as unsatisfactory as blaming the victims on theological grounds to my mind .
It ’s not the atheism — it is the egocentricity .
Some of the most important struggling humans do takes place in a theological arena ; so , I encourage all challenges and questions posed about and to God , especially in regard to human suffering .
Whether one is atheist , agnostic , religiously affiliated , or self - declared spiritual , an existential struggle with the absurdity of suffering are critical to wisdom .
Questions may be predictable and inevitable : “ How could this happen ? ” “ Why Haiti ?
It ’s so poor already ? ”
“ How could a just God allow such a thing to happen ? ” “ What does this event have to teach us ? ”
But in the last analysis they do n’t address the effects of the cataclysm on the dead , dying , and grieving — or the sick , starving , and miserable — from their place in the dramas we call life .
What about those irrecoverable losses ?
Are they merely the collateral damage of our own inner struggles ; occasions for testing , edifying , forming , and reforming ourselves ?
No , cultivating our own individual gardens , whether performed atheistically or theologically , is not a sufficient response to my mind .
If the Lisbon earthquake has anything to tell us in the face of Haiti here and now , it would have less to do with edification through the contemplation of suffering and more to do with some very practical advice — something like “ be careful or here we go again ” with our rush to asking all the wrong questions first .
I am reminded of Dr. Rieux in Camus ’ The Plague .
( Why is it the French who always capture such dilemmas so well ? )
For Rieux , disaster , in this case an outbreak of plague , might well bespeak meaninglessness , but this is irrelevant .
The point is to respond , to do any and everything one can , corporately or alone , to minister to the dead , the dying , and the survivors quarantined with them .
Ann Bracket concludes her piece on John and Charles Wesley on the occasion of the Lisbon earthquake by reminding her readers that we cannot even begin to know God ’s justice unless and until we address injustice in the arena of material human suffering .
In both cases the focus is on the ethical response to the other .
Whether atheist or practicing theist , if we are , as President Obama pledges , neither to forget nor to forsake the Haitian people , then we are called to address their misery on their terms and in regard to their needs , over and above whatever questions natural disasters force on us in the face of the suffering they inflict .
According to AndroidGuys , a tipster has reported that Sprint may just be looking to Walmart for help in providing WiMax coverage throughout the U.S. According to the source , Walmart would be adding WiMax towers on top of all of their stores , thereby catapulting Sprint to near nationwide 4G coverage in one fell swoop .
Because of the placement of the towers , Sprint could save a ton of money in zoning and the cost associated with erecting free - standing towers .
With LTE just a few months away from a global implementation , and specifically for Verizon and AT&T in the U.S. , this would be a huge addition to Sprint ’s current lead in the 4G race .
Sprint knows they need the head start and are obviously hoping to get as many new contracts as possible prior to thier competition even getting off the ground , as evidenced by their latest round of commercials and marketing information .
We also know that Sprint has plans to release WiMax enabled handsets in 2010 and the rumored partnership with Walmart would certainly help them provide their 4G service to a much larger demographic .
I do n’t know if the source is right on or just plain off his rocker , but as a Sprint customer and a resident in Walmart country , I sure am hopeful .
Let us know you think in the comments .
Update 4 pm CST : According to BGR , Verizon Wireless store managers have been told that Wednesday will be a big day and it will be a “ kick off ” for the new quarter , with a live Webcast at 1 pm EST .
Since this is the same day as the Apple media event , we ’ll let your imagination run wild with this one .
The blog world is a flutter with the rumors from an “ internal source ” saying that At&t will lose its iPhone exclusivity this Wednesday , January 27th .
HotHardware is the site that had the original leak , but there ’s been no confirmation on this .
Apple has scheduled a media event for Wednesday , and some believe its to announce this , while others think its to announce one of the biggest rumors ever of an iTablet .
We ’ll have to wait until Wednesday to see what happens .

はじめまして。このサイトの管理人、ヨウコと申します。私は2人の子供を持つ主婦です。
皆さんの中にも、首にできるイボで悩んでいる方がいらっしゃるでしょうか？首にできたイボは、触るとざらざらして手触りも悪いし、見た目にもなんだか老けて見えて、隠したくなります。
痛くもかゆくもないので、初めはなんとなく放っておこうかとも思っていたのですが、どうにも数が増えてきてしまったので一念発起、イボを治すことにしました。ここでは私が試した方法や調べたことを、イボの状況経過とともにお伝えしていきたいと思います。
首にイボができるのが悩みの種な私
私 は40代のおしゃれが大好きな主婦です。四人家族で二児の母、子供の妊娠を機に今までやっていた仕事をパートに切り替えてもらい、子供の休みの時期や朝晩を家族でゆっくり過ごせるようにしています。
夫は同い年の友達みたいな夫婦で、喧嘩も普通にするけど仲は良いほうだと思います。家族で旦那の好きな釣りに出かけたり、大型の休みにはキャンプに行ったりとアウトドア派のレクリエーションが多い傾向があります。
自分も自然の中で過ごすことが好きなので、楽しいのですが日焼けも気になります。30代からでき始めた首のイボも初めは、すぐ治るだろうと軽く考えていました。
私も数が少ないうちはそんなに気にしておらず、何だろうと思いながら年齢が出やすいという首の手入れのために、単純に保湿クリームを塗って終わりという、残念な対処をしていました。本当に数の少ないうちにちゃんと調べていれば、もっと早くにきちんとしたイボの対策ができたのにと思います。
首のイボ対策が遅れて悩んだ
このサイトは私自身が、イボについて無知識だったために対策が遅れて悩んだことを踏まえて、イボに関する知識と、皆さんに首のイボは治るということを伝えたくて立ち上げました。
私は大雑把な方で、初めはイボとも知らずにシミか何かだろう、そのうち消えるだろうと思っていました。自分の首にできたものなのに、調べもしなかったのです。
イボの数が少ないうちは場所によっては髪の毛や襟などで隠れ、自分でもあまり気になりませんでした。でもそのままほっておいた結果、どんどんと数が増えて隠れ切らなくなり、ガサガサのなんだか老けた印象の首になってしまいました。
顔の周りなのでどうしても目立ち、家族にも指摘され自分でも鏡を見るたびがっかりでテンションが下がります。毎日、家の中でまでスカーフやストールで隠すわけにもいかず、かえって布による摩擦で首の肌が擦れて、余計にイボが増える結果にもなりました。
イボを治そうと一念発起してからは、本やネットなどでイボについて自分なりにかなり調べてきました。できるだけ科学的な薬や方法にたよらずに、自然で体に優しい方法でイボを無くしたいと思っていろいろな情報を読みあさりました。そして自分がこれはいい、効くというものに出会えました。
ここではその集めに集めた情報をお分かちできるといいなと思っています。また私個人の体験談を通して、皆さんにはまだ数の少ないうちに、しっかりとイボ対策をしてつるつる若々しい首を取り戻し守っていただければ、という思いでこのサイトを書いていこうと思います。
首イボの原因と悩 み
まずは私が知らなかったイボとは何かという点から始めたいと思います。イボというのは、皮膚であればどこにでもできる可能性があるものなのだそうです。
ほとんどがウイルス感染からくるものと考えられているようですが、いくつか種類もあり、一括りイボとに言ってもそれぞれ形状も原因も異なります。
よくあるタイプのイボには、まず老人性イボと呼ばれるものがあります。これは皮膚の老化で、茶色や黒いぽつぽつとしたものができます。実は首にはこのタイプのイボができることがほとんどたそうで、特に30代からは気を付けたほうがいいそうです。
紫外線を浴びたり、ネックレスなどによる刺激から、皮膚が盛り上がってくるもので、私の首にできていたのもこのタイプでした。老人性なんてまだ40代なのに、とショックでしたが、普通に30代からできてくるそうです。
急に老化という文字を突き付けられて愕然としましたが、普通だそうで何となく安心しました。しかも良性の腫瘍という分類だそうで健康にも問題なくてよかったです。これからご紹介する方法でこの老人性首イボは消えていきますので心配いりません。
他にも多いのが小さな傷からウイルスが入り込んでできるタイプのイボで、水膨れのような形状だったり、突起物ができて膨らんだりしているものがあります。素人判断で切ったりえぐったりすると、当たり前ですが痛みや出血を引き起こしますし、跡も残ってしまいます。
しかもその傷にさらにウイルスが入り込んで、イボを増やす結果にもなりますのでやめた方がいいでしょう。形がぐちゃぐちゃで急に大きくなったりするようなタイプは、悪性の可能性もあるそうなので、きちんと皮膚科の医師に診てもらうことをお勧めします。
ここでは首にできるイボのほとんどである老人性のイボについての対策と共有できる悩みについて書きたいと思います。
首イボの解決策にはどんなものがあるのか
私の首にできたイボは、一つ一つは大きくなかったのですが、黒くて盛り上がっていてたくさんあるのでかなり目立ちました。対処法にはもちろん病院に行くという選択肢もありました。
でも私の数の多いイボは、再発しやすくそれをいちいち取るために病院に行くのは費用がかさみます。なにより治療法も調べてみると焼いたり切ったりする外科的なものが主ということだったので気が引けました。
場所も首ということもあって、何とか自然に近い方法で、自分で根本から処置できないかといろいろ調べてみたら、たくさんの自然の有効成分が見つかりました。そもそも首のイボは、皮膚の老化によってたまった角質などの老廃物でできるものがほとんどだそうです。
また皮膚が健康な状態だとイボはできにくいそうなので、皮膚を強くするということを目標にしたらいいことがわかりました。私も首にイボがたくさんできるということは、日に当たって紫外線を浴びすぎていたり、アクセサリーなどで皮膚を知らないうちに弱らせていたんですね。
そこでわたしがまず注目したのは、病院ではイボ治療に内服薬として使われている、肌の修復を促すヨクイニンという成分で、ハトムギから抽出された漢方薬です。昔から、おばあちゃんの知恵という感じで肌を白くしたいならハトムギ茶を飲むようにと言われてきました。
昔から肌にいいと言われてきた成分ですね。ヨクイニンはビタミンＢを多く含み肌の免疫を高めたり、肌の再生修復を促し肌表面のバリア機能を強めてくれるので、イボに効くというわけです。
杏子オイルというのもオーガニックなイボ治療に用いられる成分だそうです。杏子オイルは肌の脂質となじみがとてもよく、肌を柔らかく保つのにとても有効で、老人性の私の首イボのような摩擦などの刺激で固くなった角質にとても有効だと思います。
私が首イボに効くと思ったもの
いろいろ調べて分かった有効成分はたくさんありましたが、はっきりと実績として効果が出ているもので、私がこれはいいな、試してみたいなと思ったのは、先にも書いたハトムギから抽出されたヨクイニンと杏子オイルです。
この二つに注目して調べてみたら、良さそうなクリームがいくつかヒットしたので、ご紹介したいと思います。まずは「艶つや習慣」というジェル、このジェルにはイボを取る治療に使われる杏子オイルとヨクイニンがいっぺんに二つとも入っていて一石二鳥のジェルという感じです。
この注目の成分のほかに、年齢肌をしっとり柔らかくしてくれるコラーゲンなども入っていて、使っているとただイボの治療のために使うだけという以上のアンチエイジング効果を発揮してくれました。
もう一つ は 「シルキースワン」というクリームもとてもよかったです。もちろん私の欲しいヨクイニンも入っていたのと、原材料を国産のものにこだわっているところがとても安心でいいと思いました。
肌の殺菌効果も狙えて、現在あるイボを取るだけでなく、新しいイボを作らせない肌を目指せる感じです。他にもポロポロとれる杏子ジェルは、名前がいかにも効きそう！という感じで良いのと、成分も99パーセント天然成分ということでオーガニック好きの私にはとてもうれしい製品でした。
この杏子ジェルにももちろんヨクイニンと杏子エキスが入っていて、イボの抑制除去に効果を発揮してくれました。どの製品も、今日塗ったら明日イボが取れるということはもちろんありませんでしたが、それは病院での治療にも言えることで、それなりの時間がかかったことをお伝えしたいと思います。
イボの取れていく過程は、これらのクリームを塗りこんで肌のターンオーバーを活発化させて、肌の表面にあるイボを柔らかくして徐々に取っていく感じでした。
私の場合は、クリームを塗り始めてだいたい一週間ほどで肌のつやが出てきて、肌色も白くなってきたと実感できました。二三週間過ぎた頃から、イボの茶色っぽさが目立たなくなってきたという実感も出てきましたが、イボが取れたとはっきり実感できたのは、クリームを塗り始めて一か月ほどたってからです。
自分でも、あれ、なんか数が減ってる、と思ったのですが、何よりも旦那から、黒いぽつぽつの数が減ったね、と言われたのが確信につながりました。こんなふうに他の人から見てもわかるほどの変化がみられるようになったことに、いろいろと調べて、根気よくイボの対策を続けて良かったと感じました。
初めに首のイボを軽く見た結果、私が取った行動がほっておく、スカーフで隠す、でした。そこから完全にイボを増え広がらせてしまう結果になり、あわててイボについて調べて自己流で対処してきました。
初めはわからないことだらけで失敗もいろいろありました。
これはイボっていうんだ、というなんとも間抜けなところから始まりましたが、今ではこのクリームやジェルのおかげでイボもほとんどなくなり、首を隠す必要もなくなりました。洋服を選ぶときも、首を気にせずに好きなものを選べるのでほんとに良かったです。

Remember the amazing $ 1.6 million Bugatti Veyron lake crash blamed on a low - flying pelican ?
We have the video of it happening and there 's not a freaking pelican in sight .
UPDATE : The driver responds !
This was the story according to the Galveston Daily News :
The man , who refused to give his name , was looking at real estate in Galveston .
About 3 p.m. a low - flying pelican distracted him as he traveled north on Interstate 45 just south of the hurricane levee near Omega Bay .
The man jerked the wheel , dropped his cell phone , and the car 's front tire left the frontage road and entered a muddy patch , which foiled his attempt to maneuver away from the lagoon .

Yeah , that 's not what happened at all according to this video .
This was recorded by a Facebook user who appears to be taping it with a phone or digital camera just at the right moment .
Warning , they do swear appropriately at the event .
Incredible .

UPDATE : Thanks to some great follow up reporting by the Galveston Daily News and their sister paper , we now know the man is Andy House of Performance Auto Sales in Lufkin , Texas .
The shop , ironically , specializes in repairing wrecked exotics .
We contacted House for a comment and here 's what he said :
I had dropped my phone , people dont know what happened , the arnold story was made up to by the wrecker driver .
What it appeared to been was a reflection .

We 'll continue to cover this interesting story as it unfolds .
UPDATE 2 : Follow up story from the Galveston Daily News
UPDATE # 3 : We 've finally put one and one together .
Andy
House not only crashed his Bugatti Veyron into a lake , he also owns the now - repaired Eddie Griffin - crashed Ferrari Enzo !

- What is the Phylo Project ( although note that folks still refer to it affectionately as the " Phylomon Project " ) ?
Click here to read the introduction .
- Note : official URL is now - http://phylogame.org
- Forum for general discussion link
- Phylo image submissions - art | photos | school
- Join the Facebook Group
March 11/2010 : NAME CHANGE - NOW CALLED " PHYLO " :
Things are humming along !
We have over 100 images submitted , 30 or so queued up for card production , and over 40 folks signed up on the forum ( in fact , one set of rules is arguably close to beta testing ) .
The response has been simply wonderful , and these numbers do n't even the include the numerous comments and chats culled from coffee meetings to blog posts to tweets .
To us , this outpouring is something else , especially in light of the fact that we 've technically only seeded an " idea " out there !
The website , itself , is being prodded , poked and tweaked as we speak , and should be ready for a beta launch in about a week or two .
At this point in time , the main emphasis on the website is that it allows set - up , production and printing of cards in a low maintenance and open access manner .
The cards will initially have only a few major attributes on them , but will also allow for commentary so that we can continue to polish the way cards will look over time .
Hopefully , you 'll find it a treat when it 's public , but if not , then do go with the crowd sourcing mentality of this project , and let us know what you think .
Probably the main news to report is that we 've decided to change the name of the project to " PHYLO " ( note that the logo above is only a " tester " ) .
This was primarily due to conversations with various folks ( notably Cory ) who felt that having a name with " mon " at the end could set ourselves up for trademark issues since there is inferred linkage to the term " Pokemon " .
In any event , the " official " URL will now be http://phylogame.org ( although note that the http://phylomon.org will still work ) .
Finally , with info on hand from the forum , we 've quickly made some card mock - ups ( see above ) so that you can get the general sense and feel of the cards .
We 've done this because a number of media outlets have inquired about the project , and many of these requested visuals .
Anyway , for now , note that the cards have a few attributes already .
These include : ( at the top ) , name , latin name , a number depicting scale , another number depicting food chain rank embedded in a coloured circle ( indicative of diet ) ; ( in the middle ) some basic classification data ; and ( at the bottom ) simple habitat information , name and URL of artist , and some info regarding preferred climate .
More detail about this can be found at the forum , but better yet , sign up and weigh in on the various discussions .
Cheers

February 1/2010 : CALL FOR GAME DESIGN IDEAS ( edited from January 25/2010 ) :
Please do check out the images that have been submitted so far - they are , in a word , awesome !
Also , at this point in time , we have gathered a collection of individuals from the scientific community to participate in the project .
They will be asked to focus on coming up with 12 potential attributes suitable for presentation on these cards ( although use of all 12 may be subjected to space constraints ) .
Note that their choice of 12 will be strongly influenced by the feedback culled from a variety of different communities , particularily those who are passionate about game design .
To facilitate this , we have started a forum at http://phylomon.forumotion.net/
Anyone can view the forum 's content , but registration is required for participation .
You can self register at this forum ( by posting a new topic or leaving a comment ) .
Hopefully it will soon be an independent place for dialogue and discussion on the project .
We also have a FriendFeed site at http://friendfeed.com/phylomon.
This site can provide a place to upload content ( word docs , images , pdfs ) , should you not have a website / blog to present files .
Reading the FriendFeed is open to anyone , but participation / uploading privileges will require a quick registration process .
For gamers , we are interested in all of your ideas , including specific calls for organism images , or other specialized cards .
In particular , it would be wonderful if there are folks out there who feel the urge to fully design gameplay rules .
We hope that a number of these rules can facilitate initial beta testing of preliminary card sets and card games .
Rules of this nature will eventually inhabit a " game " section of the finished official phylomon website .
Again , please visit and register for the Phylomon forum by starting or contributing to a discussion ( registration is initially prompted when you want to start a topic or comment in the thread ) ..
You can take your notes on this sheet !
( pdf )
Again , if you have any questions , do n't hesitate to email me or send a tweet .
The official website is on track for an early March 2010 release .
This website will be fully capable of generating imaged blank cards .
We are hoping that the first of the working card sets with edited content and a variety of game play rules to be available by April / May .
Cheers

January 11/2010 : INITIAL SOFT LAUNCH :
Well 2010 is here , a.k.a. the International Year of Biodiversity , and to us at the SCQ , it means that we 're finally ready to go ahead with our long awaited phylomon project .
 What is this ?  you ask ?
Well , it 's an online initiative aimed at creating a Pokemon card type resource but with real creatures on display in full character design wonder .
Not only that - but we plan to have the scientific community weigh in to determine the content on such cards ( note that the cards above are only a mock - up of what that content might be ) , as well as folks who love gaming to try and design interesting ways to use the cards .
Then to top it all off , members of the teacher community will participate to see whether these cards have educational merit .
Best of all , the hope is that this will all occur in a non-commercial - open - access - open - source - because - basically - this - is - good - for - you - your - children - and - your - planet sort of way .
Why are we doing this ?
Well , it was conservationist Andrew Balmford 's letter ( Why Conservationists Should Heed Pokemon , Science .
2002 Mar 29;295(5564 ) :2367 . ) , published in Science , that provided the proverbial kick in the pants .
Essentially , he did this eye opening study to show that children as young as eight had the remarkable ability to identify and characterize upwards of 120 different Pokemon characters .
However , when the same rubric was applied using photos of real flora and fauna ( animals and plants that lived in the children 's back yards ) the results were simply horrendous .
 Our findings carry two messages for conservationists .
First , young children clearly have tremendous capacity for learning about creatures ( whether natural or man-made ) , being able to at age 8 to identify nearly 80 % of a sample drawn from 150 synthetic species . 
Second , it appears that conservationists are doing less well than the creators of Pokemon at inspiring interest in their subjects :
During their primary school years , children apparently learn far more about Pokemon than about their native wildlife and enter secondary school being able to name less than 50 % of common wildlife types .
Evidence from elsewhere links loss of knowledge about the natural world to growing isolation from it .
People care about what they know .
With the world 's urban population rising by 160,000 people daily , conservationists need to reestablish children 's links with nature if they are to win over the hearts and minds of the next generation . 
In effect , Andrew asked ,  Can we do whatever Pokemon does so well , but with the reality of biodiversity and ecology providing the content ?
With this brilliant seed of an idea , the folks behind the SCQ have been wondering whether the ideals of this thing called WEB 2.0  can work towards Andrew 's suggestion .
And with his blessing , we are now ready to pursue his idea full heartedly , optimistic that the good old internet , its social networking ability , and its often wonderfully active and engaged citizens will deliver something amazing .
How will this happen ?
Well , as we speak , a website is being carefully developed , but more importantly , it is being programmed using the nuts and bolts of the open source Wordpress software and the remarkable image organizing prowess of Flickr .
The idea here is that whatever template is produced , it will be relatively low maintenance to use and to look after , and that there will be ample opportunity for others to use it in their own locales , and for it to be tweaked , improved , for further use .
If you 'd like to see the initial layout for this website , you can download this pdf which includes the general logistics and rough design schematics .
At this point , we are planning to launch the website at phylomon.org sometime in late February , early March 2010 .
But what can I do right now ?
In a nut shell , our first order of business is to drum up enthusiasm from the graphic design and illustration community .
We 're actually hoping for something wonderful ( and a bit viral ) like the 700 Hoboes Project ( another great web based art collaboration ) .
In this respect , here are a few things you can do to help :
1 . You can spread the word to as many folks as you can .
In particular , any courting of the character design community to play would be brilliant , although any word of mouth is also greatly appreciated .
2 . As images begin to come in , feel free to comment at the Flickr group site .
It is this sort of feedback that will help guide our choices for images used in the actual cards .
We 're actually quite curious what type of imagery will be presented ( will it be ultra realistic , more character design focused , something in between , or a bit of everything )
3 . Better yet , if you are an artist , or just someone who is intrigued , then do submit a picture .
If so , here are a couple of things to consider .
FIRST : whatever image you provide , the copyright will still remain with you , the artist .
What you agree to , is allowing us the use of the image in a non-commercial educational format specifically for the home printing / production of phylomon cards .
SECOND : the image you supply would only need to be given at relatively small dimensions ( 150 d pi at 2.4 inches x 1.5 inches or 360 px X 225 px ) .
This is done on purpose so that the small size of the image limits its usefulness for the more unscrupulous folks out there .
As well , attribution and linkage to the artist 's personal website will be provided throughout the process .
This way , if a viewer loves the artist 's image , and , say , wants to buy it full size , or wants to inquire if it 's available as a t - shirt , he / she will have the option to follow up on to the artist 's personal URL .
THIRD : Submissions will occur via a Phylomon Flickr group ( links provided below ) .
Full submission details ( i.e. specific size of images and tags to include ) can be found at the Flickr group pages .
As we plan to incorporate a variety of communities in this project , we will start by creating three Phylomon submissions groups .
One for the graphic design / illustration community , one for the photography community , and also one for the school community ( i.e. kids and students can play too ! ) .
We do plan on initially focusing on the illustration elements ( where perhaps reality can be embedded during gameplay - i.e. the card can do extra when coupled with a photo brought in by the child ) , but go ahead , check them all out below and submit away !
Phylomon submissions ( Graphic Design and Illustration Community )
Phylomon submissions ( Photography Community )
Phylomon submissions ( School Community )
FOURTH :
It is hoped that a large repository of great images will collect over time .
From these pools , specific images will be chosen for card production .
This will involve our team contacting the artist for permission to include the image in the main Phylomon flickr account to create a card queue which in turn will be worked upon by a community of biodiversity scientists ( graduate and undergraduate students , with some oversight from Faculty / Research Scientists ) who will be assigned the task of providing scientifically literate content for each card .
This content will also provide and inform logistics for gameplay design .
Anyway , if you have any questions about the project please do contact me via email or twitter .
I would love to hear feedback and your ideas !
Cheers

Big thank you to Randy Laybourne , Colin Moore , and Ele Willoughby for use of their awesome images ; and , of course , to Andrew Balmford and his colleagues for the wonderful idea .
For a moment the news of Brit prisoners on home leave being handed out Viagra made me crack up , but once I understood the psychology behind it , I was more compassionate .
It ’s very vital to keep prisoners in the “ right frame of mind ” and creative writing can be a good outlet .
The P:log is a secured random blogging system for prisoners that keeps the author anonymous , but family members and mentors are allowed to identify and communicate with the author .
Agreed cryptic messages could be handed out in this system , but I guess if we restrict it to the non hardcore offenders , not much harm would come of it .

[ darcs- users ] hashed - storage work now merged in ( woo ! )
Hi everybody , So you may have noticed me saying this in a couple of recent threads .
Petr Ročkai 's hashed - storage work from his 2009 Google Summer of Code project has been merged !
I thought I would take a few moments to give everybody an overview of how this work benefits us , and where we 'll be going in the future .
In a nutshell -------------
What does this mean for you ?
Faster repository - local operations .
Hashed format repositories ( with darcs - 1 and darcs - 2 patches alike ) should now be faster to use on a daily basis .
We saw the very beginnings of this work in Darcs 2.3.0 with a faster darcs whatsnew .
Now these speed improvements cover * all * repository - local operations .
The next Darcs beta is a couple of months away , but before that , I would like to encourage you to try this out for yourself : darcs get -- lazy http://darcs.net cd darcs.net cabal install
For best results , please run darcs optimize -- upgrade followed by darcs optimize -- pristine .
Pay attention over the next couple of weeks when you try a record , amend , revert , unrecord .
If we 've done our work right , there should be nothing to see .
Darcs should be less noticeable , with fewer " Synchronizing pristine " messages and a faster return to the command prompt .
We think you 'll like it .
But please get back to us .
Is Darcs faster for you ?
If you 're particularly interested , I will step through these changes in greater detail at the end of this message .
Meanwhile , I would like to step back a little and take stock of how these improvements fit in to the bigger picture .
The road ahead --------------
The hashed storage work is a big step forward and definitely a cause for celebration .
I think it is useful to reflect on this progress and consider how it fits in with our progress since darcs 1.0.9 : - ssh connection sharing ( darcs transfer mode ) - HTTP pipelining - lazy repositories - the global cache and now - index - based diffing - hashed - storage efficiency
We cannot promise that Darcs will magically become fast overnight .
But what we can and will do is continue chipping away at it , solving problems one at a time ; release by release , a little bit better , a little bit faster every time until one day we can look back and marvel at all the progress we 've made .
So Petr 's work makes Darcs easier to live with on a day - to - day basis .
But that 's not enough .
Now we need to turn our attention to that crucial first impression ; what happens when people try Darcs out for the first time is that they darcs get a repository they want and ... then ... they ... wait ...
This is embarrassing , but we can fix it .
In fact , we already have started working on the problem .
The next version of hashed - storage will likely introduce a notion of " packs " in which the many often very small files that Darcs keeps track of will be concatenated into more substantial " packs " that compress better and reduce the ill effects of latency .
My hope is that we will be able to complete the packs work by Darcs 2.5 .
There 's a lot more progress to be made : smarter patch representations , tuning for large patches , file - to - patch caching for long histories .
And that 's just performance !

The fight continues .

See http://darcs.net/donations.html for details .
Thanks everybody and enjoy !
Eric Changes in detail ----------------- -
Darcs uses an " index " file to compute working directory and pristine cache diffs .
This avoids timestamps going out of synch when you have multiple local branches , which saves a huge and needless slowdown .
- Hashed storage is more efficient in general .
Even if you already have perfect timestamps , the new optimisations should make Darcs faster in general .
-
The new ' darcs optimize -- pristine ' reduces spurious mismatches on directories .
- Darcs no longer requires a one second sleep after applying patches .

The UN climate summit reached a weak outline of a global agreement in Copenhagen tonight , falling far short of what Britain and many poor countries were seeking and leaving months of tough negotiations to come .
After eight draft texts and all - day talks between 115 world leaders , it was left to Barack Obama and Wen Jiabao , the Chinese premier , to broker a political agreement .
The so - called Copenhagen accord " recognises " the scientific case for keeping temperature rises to no more than 2 C but does not contain commitments to emissions reductions to achieve that goal .
American officials spun the deal as a " meaningful agreement " , but even Obama said : " This progress is not enough . "
" We have come a long way , but we have much further to go , " he added .
Gordon Brown hailed the night as a success on five out of six measures .
In a press conference held after the talks broke up , Brown said the agreement was a " vital first step " and accepted there was a lot more work to do to get assurances it would become a legally binding agreement .
He declined to call it a " historic " conference : " This is the first step we are taking towards a green and low carbon future for the world , steps we are taking together .
But like all first steps , the steps are difficult and they are hard . "
" I know what we really need is a legally binding treaty as quickly as possible . "
The deal was brokered between China , South Africa , India , Brazil and the US , but late last night it was unclear whether it would be adopted by all 192 countries in the full plenary session .
The deal aims to provide $ 30 bn a year for poor countries to adapt to climate change from next year to 2012 , and $ 100 bn a year by 2020 .
But it disappointed African and other vulnerable countries which had been holding out for deeper emission cuts to hold the global temperature rise to 1.5C this century .
As widely expected , all references to 1.5C in past drafts were removed at the last minute , but more surprisingly , the earlier 2050 goal of reducing global CO 2 emissions by 80 % was also dropped .
The agreement also set up a forestry deal which is hoped would significantly reduce deforestation in return for cash .
It lacked the kind of independent verification of emission reductions by developing countries that the US and others demanded .
Obama hinted that China was to blame for the lack of a substantial deal .
In a press conference he condemned the insistence of some countries to look backwards to previous environmental agreements .
He said developing countries should be " getting out of that mindset , and moving towards the position where everybody recognises that we all need to move together " .
This was a not - so - veiled reference to the row over whether to ditch the Kyoto protocol and its legal distinction between developed and developing countries .
Developing nations saw this as an attempt by the rich world to wriggle out of its responsibility for climate change .
Many observers blamed the US for coming to the talks with an offer of just 4 % emissions cuts on 1990 levels .
The final text made no obligations on developing countries to make cuts .
Negotiators will now work on individual agreements such as forests , technology , and finance – but , without strong leadership , the chances are that it will take years to complete .
Obama cast his trip as a sign of renewed US global leadership : " The time has come for us to get off the sidelines and shape the future that we seek ; that is why I came to Copenhagen . "
But the US president also said he would not be staying for the final vote " because of weather constraints in Washington " .
Lumumba Di-Aping , chief negotiator for the G77 group of 130 developing countries , said the deal had " the lowest level of ambition you can imagine .
It 's nothing short of climate change scepticism in action .
It locks countries into a cycle of poverty for ever .
Obama has eliminated any difference between him and Bush . "
John Sauven , executive director of Greenpeace UK , said : " The city of Copenhagen is a crime scene tonight , with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport .
Ed Miliband [ UK climate change secretary ] is among the very few that come out of this summit with any credit . "
It is now evident that beating global warming will require a radically different model of politics than the one on display here in Copenhagen . "
Lydia Baker of Save the Children said world leaders had " effectively signed a death warrant for many of the world 's poorest children .
Up to 250,000 children from poor communities could die before the next major meeting in Mexico at the end of next year . "
By Sarah Braasch
I ’m scared to expose myself like this .
But , I ’m tired of the shame and the guilt and the fear .
I have something important to say .
And , I want to comfort other victims of religious abuse who feel alone and afraid .
I grew up in an abusive Jehovah ’s Witness home .
When people ask me what my childhood was like , I usually describe it , in all seriousness , as something like growing up in a war zone .
I do n’t mean to belittle or demean the experiences of children who actually grow up in literal war zones , but I struggle to find a more apt description .
The sky was always falling .
We were constantly under threat of demonic attack .
We expected Armageddon to befall us at any moment .
As children , these threats of annihilation all around us were all too real .
Demons could murder you , rape you and torture you , psychologically or physically or sexually .
The desire for the death and destruction of mankind permeated the doctrine .
Of course , this theater of horrors was exacerbated and intensified by my father ’s abuse and my mother ’s deranged denial .
I cried through my entire high school graduation ceremony .
It became a joke amongst my classmates .
It was the strangest thing .
I just could n’t stop crying .
I think I just could n’t believe that I had made it , that I was free .
I was just so overwhelmed with emotion .
My father ’s parting words to me were to tell me that I would amount to nothing without him .
He told me that I would come crawling back to him on hands and knees , begging him to take me in .
I told him to wait for me .
And to hold his breath .
It was a battle to finish my undergraduate education .
If I had n’t gone to family court at sixteen to get a restraining order against my father , I would n’t have been able to secure the financial aid necessary to continue my studies .
I had to present a copy of the order to the university to establish myself as financially independent from my parents .
Also , I was in a tremendously fragile emotional and psychological condition .
I had severed all ties with my family .
I was socially retarded .
I was completely alone .
I felt totally disconnected from the university community .
Interpersonal interactions were difficult and uncomfortable for me .
I had trouble making eye contact .
And , I thought demons were stalking me .
Being alone in the university dormitory during school breaks was the hardest .
I would sit up all night in the lobby watching TV and chatting with the overnight security guards , and I would sleep all day .
I was too embarrassed to tell anyone what was happening to me , and my childhood had been nothing if not a study in secrecy .
But , I willed myself to keep it together , to go to class , to work , to do research .
I presented as normal a face as possible to the outside world .
I gravitated towards other outsiders and social pariahs .
The goth transvestite with pet snakes .
The bisexual Jamaican dancer .
So , at 22 years old , I had spent five years at the University of Minnesota .
I had two summa cum laude engineering degrees , in aerospace and mechanical engineering .
I had a French minor .
Somehow , some way , I made it through .
The world was , seemingly , my oyster .
I decided to continue my education .
It just seemed like a good idea .
If education was good , then more education was even better .
I was racking up prizes and awards and scholarships and fellowships and internships and whatever other honors I could get my hands on .
I wanted medals and certificates and esteem .
Mostly esteem .
I was fueled by rage and hatred .
Hatred and rage .
It was driving me forward , relentlessly .
But no amount of accomplishments or successes could sate me .
I was on a mission for revenge and retribution and justice .
But , it was not to be found .
I was playing a chess game against my parents , except that I was playing a chess game against no one , because my parents were n’t playing , because they did n’t care .
That was the cruelest lesson of my twenties .
I realized that my parents were not sitting up nights worrying about my wellbeing or lack thereof .
My parents were not racked with guilt over their mistreatment of me .
My mother and my father were continuing their lives as if they did n’t have a care in the world , as if they ’d never had a little girl named Sarah .
I could n’t even hurt them .
They did n’t care .
My success was not the best revenge or any revenge at all .
My success was meaningless to them .
They did n’t care .
I had to let it go .
Their gas - lit alternate reality did n’t include me , or even a notion of me or even the idea of me .
My anger and bitterness was going to destroy me and no one would care .
I headed off to grad school at UC Berkeley .
The moment I landed , everything came crashing down .
Something inside of me snapped .
It surprised me .
I would n’t have thought it would have occurred then .
I was further removed from all of my torments , both geographically and temporally .
But , all of my demons were still with me — in my head .
I could n’t sleep .
I was terrified of the dark .
I spent my nights sitting in the bathtub , searching out the corners of the well - lit bathroom for demons .
I would pray to Jehovah throughout the night , in an almost chant - like fashion .
I did this to ward off the demons , to call upon Jehovah for protection , and to stop the bad thoughts .
If I cursed Jehovah God in my head or asked for Satan , I would scream and cry out to Jehovah to save me .
Then , I would begin chanting again .
Sometimes , a part of my brain knew that what I was doing was crazy , but I could n’t stop .
And , sometimes , I did n’t know .
Sometimes , I knew that there was a demon there , torturing me , trying to hurt me , trying to get me to kill myself .
I stopped going to class .
I stopped going to the lab .
I stopped bathing .
I spent my days either sleeping or writing out rambling tales of demons and demonic possession .
I had a complete nervous breakdown .
In a rare moment of lucidity , I realized that I was either going to drive myself totally and irrevocably insane , or that I was going to drive myself to suicide .
I knew it .
I had to choose .
There was something alluring about letting the insane parts of my mind just take me , just pull me out to sea and drown me in darkness .
I wanted to completely disassociate from reality .
Insanity would obviate the need for suicide .
Suicide was scary .
I had no fear of hell .
( Jehovah ’s Witnesses do n’t believe in hell . )
But , I had grown weary of violence .
I did n’t really want to inflict more violence upon my poor , tired body .
But , I decided that my insanity would n’t be a happy or peaceful place .
My insanity would be hell , full of pain and anguish .
If I had thought that my insane mind would have taken me to a dreamy heaven , full of cotton candy and angels and down - filled cushions , I would have gone .
I was n’t sure if I could still extract joy from life .
I was n’t sure if I could find meaning in life .
I was n’t sure if I could determine a purpose for my life .
But , I decided to try .
I decided I needed drugs .
I headed to the student health center on campus .
I told the staff psychiatrist how I was feeling about my tenuous grasp on reality , my views on demons and my thoughts of suicide , and he gave me drugs .
Lots of drugs .
The drugs worked .
I was walking through life in a hazy fog , but I liked it .
I could sleep at night .
I did n’t think about demons all of the time , but they never left me completely .
I went to class .
I went to the lab .
My productivity left something to be desired .
I had been drained of any semblance of a personality .
I even spoke really slowly .
I gained a lot of weight .
I was kind of like the walking dead .
But , I was alive .
Sort of .
And , I could function .
Kind of .
I got it in my head that I needed to leave Berkeley .
I grew tired of living like a zombie .
As often happens , I decided that I did n’t need the drugs anymore .
I decided that I just needed a new environment , a change of pace .
So , I left .
I took the first job offer I could find , and I moved to Los Angeles .
Things were going ok for a while .
Then , I decided to save my siblings .
With tragic consequences .
I basically strong - armed my older sister and my younger brother into moving out to Los Angeles and into moving in with me .
I had grandiose visions of bestowing new lives upon them , of blessing them with new horizons , of freeing them from the shackles of our hellish family and childhoods .
I would be their savior .
( And , I hoped it would irk my parents to no end . )
This ill - formed plan , of course , quickly turned catastrophic .
Three emotionally damaged and traumatized adult siblings living in close quarters and grappling with reconstructing their lives and identities is a recipe for disaster .
Trust me on this one .
Things quickly spiraled out of control .
My sister was the first to abandon ship .
She saw the light before I did .
When my sister left so did any hope we had of building a functional family out of the shards of our broken lives and psyches .
She was the sane one .
My brother and I descended into a co-dependent psychodrama hell of childhood trauma revisited .
I became cruel to him .
He embodied all of my worst fears .
He could n’t get out of bed .
He imploded in on himself .
I could n’t allow that to happen .
I forced him to get a job .
I forced him to pay rent .
I forced him to clean .
I was all about the tough love .
He became more and more detached from reality .
He would stay out all night , wandering the streets of LA .
He would tell me that he had broken into people ’s homes .
He brought home swords , which I quickly re-gifted .
He would tell me that he saw a girl , whom he knew from back home , at the restaurant where he worked .
He thought he might have raped her during a drug binge .
He told me that she sat at the bar and stared at him without saying a word .
He told me that she had come to LA to tell him that she was pregnant .
He told me that he could hear the thoughts of the customers at work .
He could hear them thinking about him , laughing at him .
He told me that the patrons in the restaurant were always talking about him , making fun of him .
He told me that he often met and saw demons as he wandered LA in the middle of the night .
He told me that he challenged Satan to a fight .
I knew he was schizophrenic , but I thought I could talk him out of it .
I know it sounds ridiculous .
He would have moments of lucidity .
I would try to reason with him , to get him to see the distinction between reality and psychosis , to teach him how to recognize the difference .
Then , one night , my brother snapped .
He was asking me pointed questions about whether or not my sister and I had been sexually abused by our father .
And , I was giving him pointed answers .
He responded violently .
I had to call the police .
I was never afraid of him until that point .
I probably should have been , but I was n’t .
Even when he told me he was hearing voices and seeing demons , even when he brought home swords .
The next day , I kicked him out .
I gathered up all of his belongings after he left for work , and I dropped them off at the restaurant .
And , I ’ve never forgiven myself .
But , I was scared .
I panicked .
I was afraid that he would kill or rape or hurt me if I let him stay .
Eventually , he made his way back to the Midwest .
My brother is currently being heavily medicated , so that he does not pose a danger either to himself or to anyone else .
I tried to save him , but I drowned him instead .
When I think about my brother , I think about how he held me as I cried out my testimony against my father in family court , about how my words became sobs , about how he put his arm around me .
And , I hate myself for abandoning him .
Religious abuse exists .
Religious abuse is real .
Who knows how many unacknowledged walking wounded limp through early adult life , struggling to put themselves back together again .
Of course , there are varying degrees and types of religious abuse , just as there are varying degrees and types of sexual and physical abuse .
Religious abuse is a form of psychological abuse .
As a society , we are loath to acknowledge this fact .
We are loath to acknowledge that raising children in religion is abusive .
We are sending millions of young persons out into the world handicapped by religious childhood traumas and indoctrination and social retardation , including religious idiocy , delusion and hatred .
For the greater part , these psychological and emotional pains remain unaddressed by our mental health profession .
Religion is not addressed as the prime mover .
I am not an aberration .
I am your high school friend .
I am your co-worker .
I am your law school classmate .
I am not unintelligent .
I am not crazy .
I have two engineering degrees and a law degree .
I have traveled the world .
I am well educated and well read .
I am a human rights activist .
I am a writer .
I am an adult survivor of childhood religious abuse .
And , so are you .

FACEBOOK COMMENTS :
Our story begins two years ago .
For those who do n’t know , VenomFangX , aka 22 - year - old Shawn , was YouTube ’s most popular creationist / Christian evangelist .
And during his time on YouTube , he made a lot of enemies not just for his ignorance but for his unparalleled arrogance , narcissism , censorship of ALL negative comments on his videos , and hypocrisy .
This led to him practically becoming the star of popular YouTube atheist Thunderf00t ’s brilliant “ Why people laugh at creationists ” series , which earned him the nickname PCS or the Posterboy for Creationist Stupidity .
Shawn decided to challenge Thunderf00t to a debate .
Thunderf00t however declined to acquiesce to his request on the grounds that it ’d be like Miss Teen South Carolina debating Stephen Hawking on black holes and the existence of gravity , while also exposing Shawn ’s total dishonesty .
After viewers got a glimpse of his wealthy parents ’ house where he lives and after previously making a specific point of mentioning how he does n’t accept donations , he soon begged his sycophantic followers for a better camera to better spread “ God ’s ” word .
Around that same time he also reported that he ’d lost his job as some retail clerk because he was pushing his unwanted Kent Hovind shwag on customers .
He seemed genuinely surprised that management frowned on this .
So this motivated him to start up a whole new website devoted to his “ ministry . ”
There he called on his fans to donate money to his site under the fraudulent promise that Shawn would donate a portion of those proceeds to a children ’s hospital .
The only cause that money went to was himself .
There was also a brief incident where another well known religious nut on YouTube , Anthony Powell aka Tony48219 , who had frequently cited VenomFangX as his inspiration , was involved in a murder / suicide .
And while Shawn ’s top critics did n’t blame him for Anthony ’s behavior or anger , it was nearly impossible to not see how such an unstable personality would be attracted to the fanaticism found in Shawn ’s videos .
Then Shawn made a melodramatic formal announcement that he was permanently shutting down his YouTube account due to alleged death threats against himself and his family , followed by an unhalted continuation of his videos .
Must have been sweeps week .
He did however delete all or most of his previous videos , leading some to wonder if this was all just an act to play the martyr while inventing a convenient excuse to erase all the firmly debunked videos of his past .
But then Shawn started to get ambitious , which led to him getting sloppy .
He was caught dishonestly trying to censor his critics by being either directly or indirectly responsible for false DMCA copyright notifications against some of his chief critics , such as Thunderf00t , which backfired when those more knowledgeable of the law informed him that this was a serious legal offense .
But when given the opportunity to have Shawn permanently removed from YouTube and take legal action against him , Thunderf00t showed him mercy by dropping the whole matter provided Shawn agreed to go into self - exile from YouTube for one year .
What Shawn failed to consider due to his total ignorance of the law was that use of clips from his videos was protected under Fair Use because his critics included commentary on the material .
His claim , based on the misunderstanding of YouTube ’s policy , was that the moment he removed a video from his channel that footage ceased to be within Fair Use .
Apparently he thought that the legal expectation was that everyone using clips from other Youtubers ’ had to remain constantly aware of whether the original source material was still available on YouTube or not .
He also left a digital paper trail acknowledging his role in the illegal action and further illustrating extreme dishonesty .
Amusingly , as you can see in the last video linked to above , Shawn opened himself to a world of trouble by upping the cockiness as he foolishly believed he was calling an empty bluff .
His overconfidence was his downfall as his opponent was holding a Royal Flush .
After making this video a year ago , the VenomFangX channel went into hiatus for awhile .
That is , until seven months ago .
That ’s when Shawn handed over his VenomFangX YouTube channel with all its sycophantic subscribers to the equally deranged YouTuber Gerrup .
Then after Thunderf00t met to discuss evolution with creationist Ray “ Banana Man ” Comfort , VenomFangX made another request for a formal debate with Thunderf00t , to which he agreed on the condition that Shawn come back to YouTube to make more creationist videos .
He made this counter offer because quite frankly Thunderf00t realizes that Shawn ’s videos only further illustrate how idiotic creationism is and that his only fans are those who already believed similarly to him from the start .
But it is an important point that Thunderf00t invited Shawn to return to YouTube as Shawn would later go on to insist that his chief critics were out to silence his voice and get him off YouTube .
Then just recently , Shawn resurfaced on YouTube with a video announcing that he ’s now attending college while unintentionally showing just how disconnected he was from the other students around him .
Though I could not find that video , here ’s a parody of it , which incorporates Shawn ’s actual audio .
And that brings us to the final VenomFangX controversy .
Popular YouTube atheist , DPRJones made a series of three videos titled , “ Why people hate you , VenomFangX ” ( here , here , and here ) .
In it , he outlined Shawn ’s history on YouTube and made a rather compelling case for why he thinks Shawn might be a sociopath .
This led to Shawn trying to pull the EXACT same tactic he ’d tried on Thunderf00t on DPRJones ’ videos .
Again , he issued false DMCA claims and again his defense was based on the same exact false interpretation of YouTube ’s policy .
Despite the fact that this was explained to him the last time , he claimed the policy is that the moment he removed a video from his channel that footage ceased to be within Fair Use .
So then DPRJones gave Shawn a warning to take down his account within ten days , similar to what Thunderf00t had initially done .
This led to a lengthy email exchange between the two , chronicled in another series of three videos ( here , here , and here ) .
In them , Shawn trotted out the old claim that crazy people had threatened his life and the lives of his family .
Though , suspiciously , that did n’t seem to deter him from returning to YouTube the last time .
He then proceeded to refuse to accept any responsibility for making his own enemies and refused to accept that by entering the public domain , he opens himself up to legitimate criticism in addition to more or less blaming DPRJones for inciting such threats by merely posting legitimate and intellectual criticisms .
The whole exchange is just an ocean of transparent lies , strategic emotional appeals , denials of responsibility , logical fallacies , and just incoherent gibberish .
This was followed by Shawn ’s bravado again as he threatened to “ take a huge chunk of videos down with me . ”
So after already undergoing all the other stages in Elizabeth Kubler - Ross ’ stages of grief , Shawn at last arrived at Acceptance :
But again , as with the Thunderf00t incident , he thought he was calling a bluff when his opponent had the far superior hand , so he included some of that classic VenomFangX bravado even though its only led to ruin .
As one can see from the above video , he refuses to accept responsibility for his actions , blames those he wronged for his troubles when he has no one to blame but himself , and makes a whole lot of excuses to give the impression that leaving YouTube was his choice when it was n’t .
And then , to add insult to injury , he chooses to not walk away without first slandering the critic he himself had wronged .
I guess the kid never learns .
Here ’s a few reactions to the death of the VenomFangX channel :
TheTachy0n
C0ct0 pusPrime
VelcroBanana –
He and DPRJones also commented on Shawn ’s ridiculous accusation here and exposing his final piece of deliberate dishonesty .
So with that , so long Shawn .
I ’d like to say it ’s been fun but , you know , like most other people , I ca n’t stand you .
DPR , sue the fucker for slander !

Australians are the world ’s most prolific users of social media according to new data from the Nielsen Company .
The firm carried out a global comparison which suggested that Australians spend an average of six hours and 52 minutes per month on social media sites – well ahead of the US , which has the next largest social media usage at six hours and nine minutes per month .
The reach of social media in Australia is also large , with Nielsen estimating a unique reach of 9.9 m Australians per month .
Although that figure should be treated with caution as double counting of users at home and at work is a major issue , it still signals that a large proportion of the country ’s 22 m population is engaging with social media .
Average time spend ( h:m:s ) on social media each month :
ADVERTISEMENT
Australia – 6:52:28 United States - 6:09:13 United Kingdom – 6:07:54 Italy – 6:00:07 Spain – 5:30:55 Brazil – 4:33:10 Germany – 4:11:45 France – 4:04:39 Switzerland – 3:54:34 Japan – 2:50:21
According to Nielsen , in December 2009 the global average in the countries it surveyed was five and a half hours per consumer on social media , making it the single most consuming online category , followed by online games and instant messaging .
Social media ’s usage was up 82 % on the same time a year previously , with more than 300 m social media users worldwide .
Facebook was the biggest driver , followed by Twitter , Nielsen said .
Despite the impact of social media , Australia ’s marketing industry has mostly failed to capitalise on it .
Late last year , The Population , Photon ’s attempt to commercialise social media closed its doors .
And although there have been some minor success stories – usually driven by the PR component of social media , there have also been some local marketing disasters , such as Toyota / Saatchi & Saatchi ’s ill - fated Clever Film Competition .
6 Things I ’d Like to Tell Your Boss about IT
I wrote a book on this subject but it focused on the management and leadership aspects of IT — not the technical stuff .
Now I ’m looking at doing a two - day class on IT for business executives .
I ’ll include the stuff from my book , but I ’m trying to identify the technical topics that I should also include in the class .
What technical topics do you feel are important for business executives to understand ?
What should your CEO know about IT ?
Here are my initial thoughts :
1. Technology trends that are changing the nature of best IT practices
Cloud computing , Software as a Service ( SaaS ) , open systems software licensing , virtual software licensing
Virtualization of storage , computers and services
storage , computers and services Data de-duplication
Business analytics and data warehousing
Access to the Internet from anywhere , and thus access to your systems from anywhere
2. Technology trends that are driving down costs and making more things possible — for companies on a tight budget , and for consumers
Mobile computing with increasing power and bandwidth , enabling remote video and increasing amounts of data transfer
Increasingly more affordable location tracking through inexpensive GPS devices
Netbooks and tablet PCs making traditional PC use more portable
Increasingly inexpensive data storage that is changing the rules on how much data you can affordably keep
Inexpensive high - volume data communication , making outsourcing and offshoring increasingly attractive , and enabling real - time connections between multiple business locations

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Houston Saturday became the first major U.S. city to elect an openly gay mayor , Annise Parker , after a hotly contested run-off election that gave gay and lesbian supporters a symbolic victory following defeats over legalizing same - sex marriages in California and Maine .

“ The voters of Houston have opened the door to history , ” Parker told supporters at a convention center in Houston .
“ I know what this win means to many of us who never thought we could achieve high office . ”
A Democrat who is now the city controller , Parker will face a $ 130 million budget deficit when her term as mayor begins in early January .
She won the run -off against fellow Democrat Gene Locke , an African - American lawyer and former city attorney , after a four - way primary in November came up inconclusive .
Last year California passed a same - sex marriage ban known as Proposition 8 and Maine voters in November overturned a state law allowing same - sex marriages .
Other big U.S. cities like Portland , Oregon and Providence , Rhode Island have openly gay mayors , but none the size of Houston -- the fourth - biggest city in the nation with over 2 million residents .
Abroad , Berlin and Paris are among cities with gay mayors .
Houston is a Democratic stronghold , but Republicans have dominated state and national elections since George W. Bush won a gubernatorial contest against Democrat Ann Richards in 1994 .
“ Most peoples ’ understanding of Texas would not be this open and this welcoming , ” said Chuck Wolfe , president of the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund .
“ But the people of Houston obviously do n’t feel that way . ”
Parker was opposed by conservative religious groups and anti-gay activists .
Houston voters are concerned less with lifestyle issues and more with bread - and - butter issues like the budget , public safety and city services , said Bob Stein , a political science professor at Rice University in Houston .
“ Voters do n’t think it ’s germane to city politics , ” said Stein , referring to the same - sex issue .
“ They think city government ’s about picking up the trash . ”
Term limits bar Bill White , Houston ’s current mayor , from seeking re-election .
White says he will run for Texas governor in a race in which Texas Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison will square off for the Republican nomination next year .
The best way to get students interested in scientific studies is to give them hands - on experiences that get them excited about the subject matter .
In chemistry courses , teachers accomplish that with test tubes and mysterious liquids .
In a course I taught recently at the University of California , San Diego , on relationship science , I piqued my students ’ interest with exercises on , well , love .
Drag racing and nanotech seemingly go together like peanut butter and ... very small rocks , but that has n't stopped a team of researchers at Rice University from creating a microscopic car dubbed a " nanodragster . "
Its wheels are buckeyballs , the rear composed of 60 carbon atoms each , while its front wheels are made of p-carborane .
This gives the car more grip at the back , meaning it'll pop wheelies just like a real dragster -- though only when running on a road paved with gold .
Even then it does n't go very fast , just .0005 inches per hour , meaning for those 1,327,000 days it takes to cover a quarter - mile its driver is free .
Spiders are known as vicious predators .
They have a voracious appetite for insects and even other spiders , and they spend most of their lives just looking for food to ensnare and devour .
But one Central American spider has a rather more laid back life , which it spends lounging in acacia trees and dining on stolen vegetarian fare .
The Bagheera kiplingi is the only known ( mostly ) vegetarian spider .
A well - documented symbiotic relationship between acacia trees and a certain species of ant produces tiny , protein - rich nubs at the end of the acacia leaves call Beltian bodies .
The ants eat these tasty buds , and in return they guard the trees from leaf - eating insects .
But Bagheera kiplingi have a taste for the Beltian bodies as well , and they go to great lengths to steal them from the guardian ants .
Being a type of jumping spider , the B. kiplingi often employ their powerful legs to jump away from the ants if they are spotted , but they have also been known to hide by dangling on a line of silk until an ant patrol has passed .
While over 90 % of the B. kiplingi’s diet is vegetarian , they do occasionally dine on ant larvae or other B. kiplingi .
When their body composition was studied by Christopher Meehan of Villanova University , the spiders ’ chemical composition indicated a predominantly vegetarian diet , confirming scientists ’ observations .
Even more interesting is the fact that scientists had been observing the relationship between the acacia trees and their guardian ants for years , but none had noticed the spiders that also benefit from the relationship .
It took a group of student naturalists to notice the spiders and bring them to the world ’s attention .
What ’s most remarkable about the spiders ’ diet is that it has long been thought that spider anatomy would n’t allow for a high - fiber diet .
They digest their food externally by liquidizing it with digestive juices before slurping it up .
Just how the B. kiplingi deals with its mostly - vegetarian menu is still being investigated .
And with all of the free time the spiders have – since they ’re not building webs to trap prey – they build elaborate nests for their young , where even the male of the species pitches in to help with family duties .
This trait is another that ’s completely unprecedented in the world of spiders .
The B. kiplingi is one unique little arachnid .

Mr. Elmer contends that his documents detail the undisclosed role of American investment management companies in funneling American , European and South American clients who wished to avoid taxes to Julius Baer ; the backdating of documents to establish trusts and foundations used to evade taxes ; and the funneling of trades for hedge funds and private equity firms from high - tax jurisdictions through Baer entities in the Cayman Islands .
Image Rudolf M. Elmer ran the Caribbean operations of the Swiss bank Julius Baer for eight years until he was dismissed in 2002 .
“ What he has is the confirmation of something very important : that a number of other banks in the voluntary disclosure process are turning up , ” Mr. Blum said , referring to 14,700 wealthy Americans , many of them UBS clients , who came forward to disclose their secret accounts last year .
The I.R.S. declined to comment on Mr. Elmer ’s case but said in a statement that it was “ investigating other banks that have enabled Americans to evade taxes . ”
Nothing indicates that Julius Baer , a 120 - year - old private bank , is under I.R.S. investigation .
The bank is known for intense privacy .
Its board chairman , Raymond J. Baer , told shareholders last April that “ the fiction of citizens being fully transparent must never become reality . ”
Julius Baer , based in Zurich , had profits of more than $ 245 million in the first half of 2009 on more than $ 200 billion in client assets .
In 2004 , it sold its American wealth management business to UBS , whose offshore private banking operations for Americans came under federal scrutiny and led the bank to pay a $ 780 million fine in 2009 and admit to criminal wrongdoing .
The acquired business was folded into a group led by Raoul Weil , the top UBS private banker who fled to Switzerland in 2009 , after being indicted in the UBS case touched off by Mr. Birkenfeld .
Mr. Elmer worked for Julius Baer nearly two decades , the first 15 years in Switzerland and then as chief operating officer of Julius Baer Bank and Trust in Grand Cayman , beginning in 1994 .
As far as his own role in helping clients evade taxes , he said , “ I did n’t realize what was going on . ”
Mr. Elmer said he discovered the tax evasion in 2002 and decided to expose Julius Baer ’s operations .
Julius Baer denies that version of events .
It contends that Mr. Elmer stole internal documents and client data around 2002 , the year he was dismissed after raising concerns about the bank in the wake of being passed over for a promotion .
He moved to Mauritius a year later .
Is this for real ?
This can't be for real .
There 's panic in the streets .
There may also be panic in the locker room or perhaps in the executive suites , but should there be panic ?
Has the team sustained a key injury to an irreplaceable player ?
No .
Has the team seen a dramatic change in the roster ?
No .
Is this the same group of players who played well in October and November ?
Yes .
Let 's put the current drought into a bigger context and see what jumps out of the data .
I spent time this week compiling a game log of all 130 + games that Coach John Anderson has coached the Atlanta Thrashers .
Let 's begin with the basics .
Below I have compiled a month - by - month summary of the Thrashers Offense , Defense , Goal Differential , Point Winning Percentage and Point Pace .
Month Year GFA GAA Gdiff Win % Pace Oct 2008 2.40 3.60 - 1.20 0.30 49 Nov 2008 3.23 3.46 - 0.23 0.50 82 Dec 2008 2.87 3.80 - 0.93 0.33 55 Jan 2009 2.85 3.23 - 0.38 0.38 63 Feb 2009 3.17 3.25 - 0.08 0.54 89 Mar 2009 3.54 3.15 0.38 0.69 114 Apr 2009 3.33 3.00 0.33 0.50 82 Oct 2009 3.40 2.80 0.60 0.55 90 Nov 2009 3.50 2.71 0.79 0.71 117 Dec 2009 2.53 3.80 - 1.27 0.30 49 Jan 2010 2.40 4.60 - 2.20 0.40 66
During the current slump the Thrashers offense has been the weakest we have see under Coach Anderson ( except for his first month as coach in October of 2008 ) .
The Thrashers have also had their worst two defensive months under Anderson during this slump ( that Jan GAA was 3.75 before the Capitals put a snowman on Atlanta ) .
The Goal Differential was positive from March through November of 2009 .
Goal Differential is the key stat here because goal differential predicts standing points with 90 % + accuracy .
If your team finishes with a positive number in Goal Differential , you 'll probably make the playoffs .
In the 2008 portion of Coach Anderson 's tenure , the Thrashers were outscored by 0.67 margin per game ( 2.87 GFA - 3.54 GAA ) and were on pace for just 63 points and a lottery pick in the NHL Draft .
In calendar 2009 ( spring and fall of 2009 ) the Thrashers played like a playoff team , outscoring the opposition by an average of 3.16 to 2.96 .
In Calendar 2010 the team has been outscored by over 2 goals per game ( 2.40 GFA - 4.60 GAA ) and is on pace to win just 66 points -- which is a lottery team pace .
Now what has happened here ?
Is this a lottery team or a playoff team ?
The Thrashers played playoff level hockey for most of Calendar 2009 and now the team performance has fallen off badly .
I think it might be valuable to review why the Thrashers started playing better back in January of 2009 .
There was a roster change as Jason Williams was deleted and Rich Peverley added .
Ilya Kovalchuk was named Captain and began playing some of his best hockey .
Kari Lehtonen returned from injury and posted a terrific SV % until he was injured again .
Zach Bogosian returned from his injury and became a top 4 stalwart .
Veterans who did n't always execute Anderson 's system were subtracted ( Havelid , Schneider , Christensen , Williams ) .
And Colin Stuart helped perk up the PK after Christensen was traded .
To summarize the previous paragraph the Thrashers turned around their team performance because of some significant roster changes or major shifts in playing time ( Peverley , Stuart , Lehtonen and Bogosian ) and because increased team cohesion on the ice and in the locker room .
Now if we think about the current Thrashers roster , rather than ask WHAT has changed , we might ask WHO has changed -- and the answer is " nobody " -- this is the same group that played well for the past few months .
Other than Antropov being hurt , this is the same lineup that played competitive hockey in 2009 .
The roster is not riddled with injuries .
The team did n't make any significant trades or call ups .
The same ingredients are present .
The pieces that are needed for winning hockey are still around .
I think some of this panic is an over - reaction because the foundation for a competitive hockey team is still in place .
If Kovalchuk is retained and they stay healthy at key positions , I still think they can make the playoffs .
They were hot and now they 're cold , this too shall pass .
( More on the hot and cold in my next post ! )
SAN FRANCISCO  Owners of the Nintendo Wii can finally stop waving their video game controllers in the air and sink back onto the couch .
Nintendo is bringing Netflix ’s online streaming video service to its
Wii gaming console , the most popular in the industry , the companies plan to announce Wednesday .
The service lets subscribers choose from a catalog of generally older movies and television shows and watch them instantly .
The deal is further evidence of a movement by makers of game consoles to broaden their appeal by positioning them as a bridge between the living room television and a wider world of online multimedia .
So far those efforts have not been enough to calm anxieties about the overall direction of the $ 16.8 billion video game business .
The industry is threatened by a dearth of popular new franchises , which tend to attract gamers to an endless number of sequels , as well as the sudden rise of cheap games for smartphones and free casual games on social networks .
As Steve Benen points out , it seems Michael Chertoff along with The Washington Post are having some conflict of interest problems -- PAGE 7 VS PAGE 15 :
" Mr. Chertoff should not be allowed to abuse the trust the public has placed in him as a former public servant to privately gain from the sale of full - body scanners under the pretense that the scanners would have detected this particular type of explosive , " said Kate Hanni , founder of FlyersRights.org , which opposes the use of the scanners .
An airport passengers ' rights group on Thursday criticized Chertoff , who left office less than a year ago , for using his former government credentials to advocate for a product that benefits his clients .
What he has made little mention of is that the Chertoff Group , his security consulting agency , includes a client that manufactures the machines .
The relationship drew attention after Chertoff disclosed it on a CNN program Wednesday , in response to a question .
Since the attempted bombing of a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day , former Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff has given dozens of media interviews touting the need for the federal government to buy more full - body scanners for airports .
The Washington Post reports today , on page A7 , that Michael Chertoff , the former DHS secretary , has been playing a little fast and loose with the public trust .
As Steve notes , that same paper allowed Chertoff a 736 - word op - ed calling for expanding the whole - body imaging technology .
No , it 's not just you Steve .
There is a huge disconnect between pages A15 and A7 .
It seems the Washington Post has as bad a case of dissociative identity disorder as the rest of our corporate media .
At least Campbell Brown bothered to point out the conflict during the CNN interview .
That does n't explain why they still brought him on when they know he 's going to profit from the technology being expanded .
Transcript via CNN below the fold .
BROWN : But what the president said , though , was systemic failure , you know , bigger than one guy dropping the ball .
Or at least from what he seems to know -- and presumably , he knows more than any of the rest of us .
So , talk me through some of the specifics , given what we know .
How do you think the system should have worked ?
CHERTOFF : Here 's what -- here 's the way it should work , and normally does work .
You get all kinds of intelligence or information from the field .
Some of it is very unreliable or questionable .
Some of it is much more reliable .
Whatever it is , it has to be written up in a report and sent by a reports officer up the chain to headquarters , and then through the National Counterterrorism Center , which is the agency set up a few years ago by Congress , to collect and integrate all the information .
All the various scraps of information are brought together .
And then an evaluation has to take place .
Is it reliable ?
Is it specific ?
Does it suggest that some action has to be taken ?
And then , of course , if it is sufficiently specific and reliable , action should be taken .
So , at any point along that chain , people have the responsibility for making sure that they are accurately and fully reporting what they 've learned .
And then there are going to be some judgments that have to be made about whether and what action ought to be taken , based on the information .
BROWN : Bigger picture , what do we do to protect ourselves ?
Clearly , the systems in place did n't work , if somebody was able to get that far in the process .
When we talk about screenings at the airport and other protective mechanisms along the way , what should we be doing that clearly were not ?
CHERTOFF : Well , Campbell , the strategy recognizes that there 's always going to be human error in any system .
You can't count on perfection .
And that 's why we built a strategy at the Department of Homeland Security of what we call " layered security " -- a number of different layers , so that even if one fails , another one gets picked up .
It 's complicated here , of course , because the actual screening took place overseas , where the U.S. ability to control what goes on is obviously not the same as it is here .
But there are a few things we could do to make things better .
First , we could deploy the scanning machines that we currently are beginning to deploy in the U.S. , that will give us the ability to see what someone has concealed underneath their clothing .
That has been vigorously opposed by the ACLU and privacy advocates .
The House of Representatives voted to prevent us from using it .
But I think now there 's been a very vivid lesson in the value of that machinery .
BROWN : OK .
Can I stop you there for a second ?
CHERTOFF : Yes .
BROWN : I know you 've been an advocate of this technology for a long time .
CHERTOFF : Correct .
BROWN : But just , in the interest of full disclosure , I also want to point out , in your current role as a security consultant , you are representing some of the companies who manufacture that technology .
Correct ?
CHERTOFF : Absolutely correct , yes .
BROWN : OK .
Go ahead .
CHERTOFF : A second thing is , it apparently is the case the British did revoke the visa for this individual earlier this year .
That information may not have been communicated to American authorities .
Why is that ?
Because the European Union has been very , very adamant in refusing to share information about immigration problems that they discover with American authorities .
So , we 've got to go back to the E.U. and fight this fight all over again , and tell them that their exalting privacy over security could very well have resulted in a tragedy that would have killed Europeans as well as Americans .
So , that 's another measure we could put into place to help cure this problem .
The third thing is , we 're going to have to go back and see whether we need to light a fire under some of the people involved in the reporting process , to make sure that they move with urgency and with accuracy when they get reports of the kind that we saw apparently came into the Nigerian embassy .
BROWN : There has also been a renewed debate about racial profiling here .
I know you have been opposed to this .
And it 's not for civil liberties -- or not only , I guess , for civil liberties reasons -- but largely because you do n't think it 's effective .
Explain your reasoning .
CHERTOFF : Well , the problem is that the profile many people think they have of what a terrorist is does n't fit the reality .
Actually , this individual probably does not fit the profile that most people assume is the terrorist who comes from either South Asia or an Arab country .
Richard Reid did n't fit that profile .
Some of the bombers or would - be bombers in the plots that were foiled in Great Britain do n't fit the profile .
And in fact , one of the things the enemy does it to deliberately recruit people who are Western in background or in appearance , so that they can slip by people who might be stereotyping .
So , I think the danger is , we get lulled into a false sense of security , if we profile based on appearance .
What I do think is important is to look at behavior .
And that 's something that we are doing and should continue to do more of .
The Bible ’s reference to the “ four corners of the earth ” need not mean that the world is flat .
It could be a tetrahedron .
Soprano Daniela Dessi was set to play the lead in Franco Zeffirelli's new La Traviata , but quit the production after the legendary director made a crack about her build :
It used to be that opera was one branch of the performing arts where talent was all , which is why it made such waves in 2004 when soprano Deborah Voigt was fired from the role of Ariadne at Royal Opera House for her failure to fit into a black dress .
Now , Daniela Dessi has come under attack - humiliatingly , at a press conference at Rome 's Rome 's Teatro dell ' Opera .
According to the Telegraph ,
" She is a long way from my image of [ consumptive courtesan ]
Violetta , who is certainly not a well - built girl , " said Mr Zeffirelli , adding that she was too old to convincingly appear in a tale of youthful passion .

Said Dessi , 52 , whose opera singer husband also quit in solidarity , " These days directors unfortunately have excessive power .
I could maybe accept that , if they made their views known before one signs the contract , rather than after the artist has started to work with the orchestra conductor and the production is sold out . "
Dessi is an acclaimed irico - spinto soprano who has performed leads in opera houses all over the world ; this would have been her European debut as Violetta , whom she sang in Japan .
After the Royal Opera House controversy , Voigt underwent gastric bypass surgery and lost over 100 pounds .
While she claims the notorious incident did not effect her decision , one hopes that Dessi will not feel pressured to take similar measures - and that Zeffirelli will consider an apology to a respected and talented performer who deserved better .

Soprano Daniela Dessi Quits Over Franco Zeffirelli Weight Jibe [ Telegraph ]
Elena has been sick for more than a week now .
She had simple cold symptoms , but last weekend she started having periodic coughing fits that went on for what seemed like a long time and were almost uncontrollable .
I have a hard time describing the cough–sort of short and full of mucous , and while she ’s in a coughing fit she hardly has time to breathe between the coughs .
We have two effective ways to stop the coughing : give her some juice , or steam up the bathroom with hot water and take her in there until it ’s over .
The coughing fits only happen a few times a day , often after she ’s been doing something more strenuous while playing , but they have woken her up in the middle of the night .
On Tuesday we decided to get some medical help , so Jenny called the nurse line and they had her make a doctor ’s appointment .
The doctor decided to treat her for whooping cough based on her symptoms and the fact that there has been a recent outbreak of whooping cough around here .
The tests for the whooping cough take several days to run and are not entirely reliable , and in this case it ’s best to start a course of antibiotics without waiting for results .
Another name for whooping cough is pertussis , which is the P in the DTaP vaccination .
Since Elena has followed the recommended immunization schedule , she ’s already had three of these shots , so you might wonder why she still got sick .
We discussed this briefly in my mathematical biology class so I can give an overview of the dynamics .
I ’ll try not to get too mathematical or launch into too much of a rant , but be forewarned , because I ca n’t make any guarantees .
Like almost all immunizations , the DTaP shot is only partially effective .
Studies of effectiveness are always done at the population level , not on individuals , so it ’s unclear what “ partially effective ” means .
It could mean that most people are completely immunized while a few are completely unprotected , or it could mean that everyone immunized has a smaller chance of falling ill , but is still slightly susceptible .
Of course , it ’s probably some combination of the two : inoculated individuals are protected to varying degrees , depending on a wide set of complicated factors .
This matters when combined with the idea of how contagious a disease is .
Pertussis has a contagion rate of 70 - 100 % , so if an non-immunized person is exposed , it ’s almost a certain thing that they will fall ill .
The most basic model used by epidemiologists to study the spread of disease is called SIR , an acronym for “ Susceptible , Infected , Recovered , ” which is the progression that individuals go through .
In the model , you look at the percentage of the population in each of those categories over the time of a disease outbreak .
In order to do so , information about contagiousness , population susceptibility , and recovery rates is plugged into a matrix , which then can be multiplied against the population percentages .
The resulting system can be analyzed to see whether the disease is likely to die out , maintain a steady level , or explode into an epidemic .
All of that depends on some things called the eigenvalues of the matrix .
You do n’t need to know exactly what that means , but you do need to know that matrix multiplication does n’t work like regular multiplication .
Two matrices that look very similar could bring about very different behaviors , because they have qualitatively different eigenvalues .
Specifically , any eigenvalues bigger than mean the outbreak will grow , while eigenvalues smaller than mean that it will die out .
So even though there ’s a much bigger difference between and than there is between and , the first pair would imply similar similar behavior and the second pair gives very different behavior .
If we want to reduce the spread infectious disease ( at the demographic level of policy and public health ) , there are only a few things that we can try to do , such as improving the effectiveness of our vaccines , but that ’s likely to take a long time .
There ’s really just one thing that can be done on a large scale in a short time : increase the level of vaccination in the population .
When you model these kinds of changes , the non-linearity of the system becomes clear .
If you guess that 50 % of the population is vaccinated , and see what happens when you move that up to 65 % , it might be that there are no visible changes –the disease goes on as before .
But then if you move it up just a little bit more , say to 70 % , then you cross over the threshold and change the eigenvalues , which makes the outbreak less likely to persist .
Sometimes this is called “ herd immunity ” because it works only on a large scale , and means that it ’s actually okay for a certain number of people to remain unvaccinated , because they ’re effectively protected from exposure by the immunity of the rest of the group .
So what does this all mean ?
First , it ’s okay for vaccines to be only partially effective , because a second layer of protection kicks in when enough people get vaccinated .
Second , it ’s unrealistic to vaccinate every person in a population .
Some people just do n’t go to the doctor , some are still too young for the vaccine , some have legitimate allergies ( eggs are the foundation of many vaccines , and some people are allergic ) .
But that ’s okay , because those people get the protection of the entire group .
It ’s even okay for a few crazy people to not want immunization for irrational reasons .
What ’s not okay is when those people write about it on blogs or appear on Oprah–then this influences others and it becomes a movement , which changes the dynamics and threatens everyone ’s immunity .
Vaccine schedules are created by smart people for a reason , which is to optimize the health and safety for each individual .
But they optimize in two dimensions –the miniscule risks presented by the vaccine itself , and the much greater risk of catching the disease if not enough people are immunized .
The second dimension is the important one , but it ’s the one that people ignore , because they do n’t understand how it works .
They do n’t understand that the risks are nonlinear .
By not vaccinating , they take advantage of the group , but this only works up to a point , after which outbreaks and sustained epidemics become likely .
When a non-vaccinator makes their choice , they probably do n’t accurately consider the risk that their child will get sick , because serious , dangerous diseases are extremely rare in our modern world .
We ’ve eradicated many of the terrible diseases of yesteryear .
The way we did it was –no surprises here –through vaccinations !
If the vaccination campaigns had n’t worked so well , and terrible diseases like polio and smallpox were still prevalent , I can guarantee that nobody would worry about nonexistent links between autism and vaccination .
But these things can come back when large numbers of people opt out of vaccination .
There was a tragic story about measles on This American Life some time ago .
I ’m not worried about Elena .
She ’s happy and strong , the cough seems not to bother her too much and the coughing spells have been far shorter in the past few days .
She may not even have whooping cough ; we still have n’t received the results .
But if she does , it ’s a little bit frustrating to know that she might have a cough that lingers for months , when we did everything we could to avoid it .
So my next step is to try to use this tiny platform of mine to sway the public discussion in the right direction , and help people understand why non-vaccinators are misguided .
I hope that all of you vaccinate your children on the recommended schedule , and can encourage people to get the real facts when they are trying to understand how it works .
Updated : I changed a few small things at the beginning for clarity and accuracy , based on Jenny ’s first - hand account of Elena ’s doctor ’s visit .
She also summarized things succinctly for me :
When a person decides to not vaccinate their child , or even to follow a delayed scheduled , they are not just deciding to take on the risks for their own child of not vaccinating .
They are putting every person their child comes into contact with at increased risk .
This could be compared to the unfairness of people affected by second hand smoke – but at least in those cases you can see and smell the smoke .
It ultimately falls to one man to decide if we ever see headlines that shout : “ Penn State Climate Prof Fudged Facts to Fetch Funding ” , or perhaps “ Nittany Lyin ’ : Penn State ’s Mann on the Street . ”
Henry “ Hank ” Foley , the new vice president for research and dean of the graduate school , will hold professor Michael Mann ‘s academic future in his hands if an internal inquiry , now under way , sparks an investigation that finds Mann broke university policy .
But results of Penn State ’s internal Climategate probe may not come until Mann ’s part of the globe really warms up , in May or June .
In addition , you may never learn what really happened between Mann and other leading lights in the global warming movement .
That ’s because Penn State , like other universities , treats such inquiries as confidential personnel matters , protected by policy “ to the maximum extent possible . ”
More surprising , the initial probe involves a committee of just three , all of whom are Penn State employees with a clear interest in preserving the reputation of a university ranked ninth in the nation in receiving government research and development grants .
It may raise some eyebrows to know that no outsiders will monitor the proceedings .
The stakes could n’t be higher .
The perception of integrity in the climate research community will likely determine whether trillions of dollars are pumped into less - developed nations in the form of virtual reparations to atone for 150 years of unequal occupation of the so - called “ carbon space ” by more prosperous nations .
Still , the public is asked to trust the findings of a secret probe conducted by the colleagues of the accused .
Michael Mann created the now - famous “ hockey stick ” graph , which Al Gore cited in “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” his Oscar - winning Powerpoint presentation .
Mann also received email from Phil Jones , director of the University of East Anglia ‘s Climate Research Unit , in which Jones appeared to suggest he had used a “ trick ” to “ hide the decline ” in global average temperatures .
Another Jones note asks Mann to delete emails that were the target of a Freedom Of Information Act request .
It ’s in the context of one of the biggest stories of the decade — a scandal that called into question the credibility of an entire scientific discipline — that Penn State launched its initial 60 - day inquiry .
Ordinarily , the probe panel would include the dean of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences .
However , Dean William Easterling recused himself because he was one of the lead authors of the report from the United Nation ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Easterling and co-authors shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore .
So , the team consists of Foley , plus William Brune , Mann ’s boss , who has headed Penn State ’s meteorology department for about a decade , and Candice Yekel , director of the Office of Research Protections , who reports to Foley .
If the committee feels the allegations warrant further scrutiny , Foley will appoint another committee — this time five tenured professors who have “ no conflicts of interest and are competent to evaluate the issues objectively . ”
The ad hoc panel has 120 days to “ conduct a prompt and thorough investigation ” to determine whether Mann violated university policy .
If they think he did , he ’ll have 14 days to respond .
Hank Foley alone would determine whether to accept or reject the investigation committee ’s findings in whole or in part .
Then he would tell Mann ’s boss , Bill Brune , what to do about it .
“ This is quite a different case than we ’ve had in the past , ” said university spokeswoman Lisa Powers .
“ We take any claims of misconduct very seriously … in some cases the people have been separated from the university . ”
However , she added , “ Sometimes allegations are brought forward that have no validity . ”
Funding agencies that channel public dollars to Mann ’s research would receive the report of the investigation committee ’s findings and any disciplinary action , Powers said , but the circle of knowledge could end there .
Glacier melt claims were ' speculation '
The International Panel on Climate Change was forced to admit its key claim that Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035 was lifted from a 1999 magazine article .
The report was based on an interview with a little - known Indian scientist who has since said his views were “ speculation ” and not backed up by research .
It was also revealed that the IPCC ’s controversial chairman , Dr Rajendra Pachauri , described as “ the world ’s top climate scientist ” , is a former railway engineer with a PhD in economics and no formal climate science qualifications .
Dr Pachauri was yesterday accused of a conflict of interest after it emerged he has a network of business interests that attract millions of pounds in funding thanks to IPCC policies .
One of them , The Energy Research Institute , has a London office and is set to receive up to £ 10 million from British taxpayers over the next five years in the form of grants from the Department for International Development .
Dr Pachauri denies any conflict of interest arising from his various roles .
Yesterday , critics accused the IPCC of boosting the man-made global warming theory to protect a multi-million pound industry .
Climate scientist Peter Taylor said : “ I am not surprised by this news .
A vast bureaucracy and industry has been built up around this theory .
There is too much money in it for the IPCC to let it wither . ”
Professor Julian Dowdeswell , a glacier specialist at Cambridge University , said : “ The average glacier is 1,000 ft thick so to melt one even at 15ft a year would take 60 years .
That is a lot faster than anything we are seeing now so the idea of losing it all by 2035 is unrealistically high . ”
The IPCC was set up by the UN to ensure world leaders had the best possible scientific advice on climate change .
It issued the glacier warning in a benchmark report in 2007 that was allegedly based on the latest research into global warming .
The scientists behind the report now admit they relied on a news story published in the New Scientist journal in 1999 .
The article was based on a short telephone interview with scientist Syed Hasnain , then based in Delhi , who has since said his views were “ speculation ” .
The New Scientist report was picked up by the WWF and included in a 2005 paper .
It then became a key source for the IPCC which went further in suggesting the melting of the glaciers was “ very likely ” .
Yesterday , Professor Murari Lal who oversaw the chapter on glaciers in the IPCC report , said : “ If Hasnain says officially that he never asserted this , or that it is a wrong presumption , then I will recommend that the assertion about Himalayan glaciers be removed from future IPCC assessments . ”
Last year the Indian government issued its own scientific research rejecting the notion that glaciers were melting so rapidly .
Before the weakness in the IPCC ’s research was exposed , Dr Pachauri dismissed the Indian government report as “ voodoo science ” .
The revelations are the latest crack to appear in the scientific consensus on climate change .

Alan Grayson , the first - term Democratic congressman from central Florida , really did n’t like Thursday ’s Supreme Court decision legalizing unlimited corporate spending in election campaigns .
“ It ’s the worst Supreme Court decision since the Dred Scott case , ” he told me last night .
In Dred Scott , Grayson explained , the Supreme Court decided that neither slaves nor the children of slaves could ever be US citizens .
In Citizens United v. FEC , decided Thursday , the Supreme Court ruled “ that only huge corporations have any constitutional rights , ” Grayson said .
“ They have the right to bribe , the right to buy elections , the right to reward their elected toadies , and the right to punish the elected representatives who take a stab at doing what ’s right . ”
I wrote a profile of Grayson for the most recent issue of Mother Jones .
You can read the whole thing here .
Like independent campaign finance reform groups , Grayson saw this decision coming .
Last week , he filed five bills that he hopes will help counteract the effects of the Court ’s decision .
On Wednesday night , he launched a website , savedemocracy.net , to rally support for these measures .
On Thursday morning , he delivered over 10,000 signatures from a web - based petition to the Supreme Court .
After the court issued its decision , he introduced a sixth campaign finance reform bill .
The Court ’s decision creates serious problems for the Fair Elections Now Act ( FENA ) , a bill that Grayson co-sponsored that would institute publicly financed elections .
“ The funding from FENA is a drop in the bucket compared to what the oil companies might spend to defeat representatives who do n’t want to drill everywhere , ” Grayson warned .
“ It ’s a drop in the bucket compared to what Wall Street ’s prepared to spend to reward those who vote for bailouts and punish those who wo n’t . ”
The Supreme Court has “ created a whole new problem ….
that really is n’t addressed by that bill , ” Grayson said , while emphasizing that he still supported FENA because it is “ a step in the right direction , but not sufficient . ”
Via Grayson ’s website , here are the six bills “ and what they aim to accomplish , ” :
The Business Should Mind Its Own Business Act ( H.R. 4431 ) : Implements a 500 % excise tax on corporate contributions to political committees , and on corporate expenditures on political advocacy campaigns .
The Public Company Responsibility Act ( H.R. 4435 ) : Prevents companies making political contributions and expenditures from trading their stock on national exchanges .
The End Political Kickbacks Act ( H.R. 4434 ) : Prevents for - profit corporations that receive money from the government from making political contributions , and limits the amount that employees of those companies can contribute .
The Corporate Propaganda Sunshine Act ( H.R. 4432 ) : Requires publicly - traded companies to disclose in SEC filings money used for the purpose of influencing public opinion , rather than to promoting their products and services .
The Ending Corporate Collusion Act ( H.R. 4433 ) : Applies antitrust law to industry PACs .
The End the Hijacking of Shareholder Funds Act ( H.R. 4487 ) :
This bill requires the approval of a majority of a public company ’s shareholders for any expenditure by that company to influence public opinion on matters not related to the company ’s products or services .
The fifth measure has already gained the support of Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) , the chair of the House Judiciary committee , Grayson said .
Grayson hopes the committee might hold a hearing on that bill sometime in the next 30 days .
Grayson circulated his proposals among his colleagues on Thursday .
He has a decent record with winning support for populist ideas — last year he signed up over 100 cosponsors for Texas Republican Ron Paul ’s bill to audit the Federal Reserve .
Still , what Grayson could really use is the support of President Barack Obama , who has slammed the Supreme Court decision and promised a “ forceful ” legislative response .
Grayson ’s bills would certainly qualify .
The Atlantic ‘s Marc Ambinder has reported that the White House and other Hill Democrats are seriously considering three options for responding to the decision , including one that bears a resemblance to Grayson ’s sixth bill — requiring shareholders to approve of independent political expenditures .
When we spoke , Grayson also voiced support to another idea Ambinder says is under consideration — a “ Stand by Your Ad ” requirement .
As Ambinder describes it , “ The head of an insurance company would be forced to say , ‘ I ’m Honus Wagner , the CEO of Acme , and I stand by this ad . ' ”
Grayson emphasized that such a move would be consistent with the Supreme Court ’s decision today , which explicitly allowed Congress to pass tough disclosure requirements .

" Three weeks after New Hampshire legalized gay marriage , opponents will ask a House committee Wednesday to repeal the law and let voters amend the constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman .
The House Judiciary Committee is holding hearings on the two measures that many expect the House to reject when they are brought to the floor in the next few weeks .
Opponents know their chances of success are slim at this point , but they are looking to the November election in hopes Republicans will regain control of the Statehouse and succeed then in repealing the law .
Opponents of marriage equality are planning town meetings this spring to engage the public and pass nonbinding resolutions against equality .
" State Rep. David Bates , a Republican from Windham , is organizing the
petition effort to put gay marriage before town voters .
He said Tuesday
that petitions have been certified in 108 towns .
He expects petitions
to be completed by a Feb. 2 deadline in about 150 of New Hampshire's
more than 200 towns that hold meetings each spring .
Petitions must be
signed by 25 registered voters in the town to be put on the agenda . "
Sunday , January 3rd 2010 , 2:15 AM EST
Dear Mr. Baum : Your editorial on " Climategate " concludes : " What more is there to say ? " .
The simple answer is " lots more " , and here it is .
The last time C & E News made as big a fool of itself as it has recently with your editorials supporting the theory of human - caused global warming , was when it took seriously the claims that cold fusion had been achieved in an electrochemical cell .
Every knowledgeable physicist knew that those claims were absurd , and in a short period of time , scientists all over the world showed that the electrochemists who made those claims had gotten their energy balances wrong .
Out of ignorance and chauvinism , C & E News managed to morph an honest error of judgment by the electrochemists into a political turf battle between chemists and physicists .
You are making the same mistake now in your totally misinformed and ignorant position supporting the theory that human emission of CO2 is causing global warming in the face of the overwhelming amount of data that proves that the theory is false .
Attached are copies of my articles that summarize the available data .
One of the articles also analyzes the motivations of the several groups that support the theory .
So let me ask you a simple question : when was the last time you analyzed a weather map and prepared a useful weather forecast based on that analysis ?
Or , when was the last time you analyzed the climatological evidence for the world - wide existence of the Medieval Warm Period that the IPCC wiped out of existence on the basis of a phony computer program and a biased selection of data that gave them the infamous and fraudulent " hockey stick " temperature curve that we now know " hid the decline " as revealed by the " climategate " e-mails ?
Any objective scientist comparing his tree ring results that showed a declining temperature in the most recent decades with direct measurements that showed an increasing temperature over the same period , would have questioned the validity of the tree ring results .
Instead , he and the other " climategaters " , conspired to " hide the decline " .
After reading your recent editorials on the subject , it is clear that you are completely unqualified in meteorology , climatology , or in scientific judgment , to have a credible opinion on the issue of human caused global warming / climate change , and that you owe it to your readers to honestly admit that .
There is a simple way to tell the difference between a scientist and a propagandist .
If a scientist has a theory , he searches diligently for data that might actually contradict his theory so that he can test its validity or modify it as necessary .
The propagandist , on the other hand , carefully selects only that data that might agree with his theory and dutifully ignores any data that disagrees with it .
Regretfully , I conclude that you are in the camp of the propagandists , and as such , your editorials on the subject are a disservice to the American Chemical Society .
Your argument based on the authority of " The national science academies of every major developed and developing country " are worthless in the face of the data .
Need I remind you that until his dying day , Joseph Priestley himself , and all the major science authorities of his day , were firm believers in the " phlogiston " theory of combustion .
It took only a few of Lavoisier 's careful experiments to prove that the theory held by all the science authorities of his day , was false ( and look what happened to Lavoisier ! ) .
Your complete refusal to recognize the appalling lack of scientific integrity displayed by those involved in the " climategate " scandal clearly shows your own lack of scientific integrity on this issue .
The simple 1909 experiment of Wood showed clearly that the so - called " greenhouse effect " was devoid of physical reality .
Most of the earth 's infrared radiation passes through the atmosphere and is lost to the void of free space whose temperature is near absolute zero .
What little is absorbed by atmospheric CO2 is reradiated to that same void .
The notion that the colder atmosphere aloft can reradiate that energy to heat the warmer regions of the earth below via the " greenhouse effect " , is a direct violation of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics .
So what is it about the 2nd .
Law of Thermodynamics that you do not understand ?
Sincerely , Dr. Martin HertzbergP. O. Box 3012 Copper Mountain , CO 80443
Dr Hertzberg has a Ph D in Physical Chemistry from Stanford , earned his B A degree , cum laude , from the Heights Campus of New York University , and was trained as a meteorologist at the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School .

Digby 's right .
The Villagers are constitutionally incapable of taking in any information that contradicts their consensus narrative , as you 'll see in this clip with Terry Moran and David Axelrod on This Week :
MORAN : So according to the president , then , David , health care reform as we know it , that huge bill that Congress labored on for months , is dead , right ?
AXELROD : No , that 's not true at all , Terry .
I think what he 's saying is let 's take a look at this .
There are so many elements of this -- tax breaks for small business , extending the life of Medicare , more assistance for seniors with their prescription drugs , a cap on out - of - pocket expenses , help for people with pre-existing conditions -- that are too important to walk away from .
What he 's saying is , let 's get back to it .
Now , I will -- I must tell you that , if you look at the polling in the Washington Post yesterday on the Massachusetts race , it 's very clear , people do n't want us to walk away from health care .
They want us to address their concerns with the program , and they want Brown to come and work with us and not be obstructionist .
That was very clear in the polling .
And I suggest that the Republican Party look at that poll , as well .
Their policies were viewed more dimly than -- than Democratic policies .
And people were crying out for cooperation instead of obstructionism .
So we 're looking forward to working together to pass this on behalf of the American people , who are going to feel greater and greater burden from this -- these health care costs if we do n't step up and deal with it .
MORAN : You 're looking forward to pass this .
Now , this -- the president sounded like he was reducing the scale , let 's coalesce around some core elements , insurance reform , cost containment .
And -- and are you talking -- what do you think of the idea that is being ...
AXELROD : Well , I think what the president ...
MORAN : I do have a question here .
What do you think of the idea that Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid are cooking up that you could essentially strip the Senate bill of a few provisions on a parliamentary maneuver requiring only 51 votes and then getting the bill through the House ?
Do you , A , think that 's possible ?
And , B , getting the original $ 800 billion bill that the voters of Massachusetts soundly rejected , do you think that 's a good idea ?
AXELROD : Terry , again , I think you 're misreading the Massachusetts poll .
I think people want action on health care .
In fact , the bill that the House and the Senate passed , which are largely the same in the main , were patterned in many ways on the Massachusetts health care plan , which is a unique plan in that state .
And 68 percent of the people who voted last week said they liked the Massachusetts plan .
Senator Brown said he would n't change it .
One thing AMD has taught me is that you can never beat Intel at its own game .
Simply trying to do what Intel does will leave you confined to whatever low margin market Intel deems too unattractive to pursue .
It ’s exactly why AMD ’s most successful CPU architectures are those that implement features that Intel does n’t have today , but perhaps will have in a few years .
Competing is n’t enough , you must innovate .
Trying to approach the same problem in the same way but somehow do it better does n’t work well when your competition makes $ 9B a quarter .
We saw this in the SSD space as well .
In the year since Intel ’s X25 - M arrived , the best we ’ve seen is a controller that can sort - of do what Intel ’s can just at a cheaper price .
Even then , the cost savings are n’t that great because Intel gets great NAND pricing .
We need companies like Indilinx to put cost pressure on Intel , but we also need the equivalent of an AMD .
A company that can put technological pressure on Intel .
That company , at least today , is SandForce .
And its disciple ?
OCZ .
Yep , they ’re back .
Why I Hate New SSDs
I ’ll admit , I have n’t really been looking forward to this day .
Around the time when OCZ and Indilinx finally got their controller and firmware to acceptable levels , OCZ CMO Alex Mei dropped a bombshell on me - OCZ ’s Vertex 2 would use a new controller by a company I ’d never heard of .
Great .
You may remember my back and forth with OCZ CEO Ryan Petersen about the first incarnation of the Vertex drive before it was released .
Needless to say , what I wrote in the SSD Anthology was an abridged ( and nicer ) version of the back and forth that went on in the months prior to that product launch .
After the whole JMicron fiasco , I do n’t trust these SSD makers or controller manufacturers to deliver products that are actually good .
Aw , sweet .
You 'd never hurt me would you ?
Which means that I ’ve got to approach every new drive and every new controller with the assumption that it ’s either going to somehow suck , or lose your data .
And I need to figure out how .
Synonyms for daunting should be popping into your heads now .
Ultimately , the task of putting these drives to the test falls on the heads of you all - the early adopters .
It ’s only after we collectively put these drives through hundreds and thousands of hours of real world usage that we can determine whether or not they ’re sponge - worthy .
Even Intel managed to screw up two firmware releases and they do more in - house validation than any company I ’ve ever worked with .
The bugs of course never appeared in my testing , but only in the field in the hands of paying customers .
I hate that it has to be this way , but we live in the wild west of solid state storage .
It ’ll be a while before you can embrace any new product with confidence .
And it only gets more complicated from here on out .
The old JMicron drives were easy to cast aside .
They behaved like jerks when you tried to use them .
Now the true difference between SSDs rears its head after months or years of use .
I say that because unlike my first experience with OCZ ’s Vertex , the Vertex 2 did not disappoint .
Or to put it more directly : it ’s the first drive I ’ve seen that ’s actually better than Intel ’s X25 - M G2 .
If you have n't read any of our previous SSD articles , I 'd suggest brushing up on The Relapse before moving on .
The background will help .

This morning at around 8:40 a bicyclist was struck from behind by a hit and run driver in the south bound bicycle lane on Bear Cut bridge .
The driver was apprehended about 4 miles away from where he struck and killed the bicyclist ; the bicycle still underneath the car .
I do n’t know all the facts of the accident yet , but I can assure you there is not a single factor that contributed to the death of this bicyclist .
There will be plenty of blame to be shared ; especially by the County Public Works Department which designed the dangerous and inadequate bicycle facility on the Rickenbacker Causeway .
There are 1000 ’s of bicyclists that ride the Rickenbacker Causeway every weekend .
Accidents like this can be prevented be designing proper bicycle facilities .
This is the second fatality in the past three years on the Rickenbacker Causeway .
Numerous other bicyclists have been injured here too .
Our condolences go out to the family of the bicyclist .
A Stockholm department store has removed a new line of North Korean - made designer jeans from its shelves , saying it wanted to avoid courting controversy with ties with the communist nation .
The PUB department store ’s management had not been informed that the jeans would be carried in its space , and it pulled the plug when it became aware of it , Rene Stephansen , the store ’s director , said Saturday .
“ For us , this is not a question of Noko Jeans — this is a question about a political issue that PUB does n’t want to be associated with , ” he said .
“ This is not the forum for the discussion ” of North Korea .
The Noko Jeans line was the brainchild of three Swedish entrepreneurs who hoped their label would help break North Korea ’s isolation through increased trade with the West .
The jeans come only in black , partly because blue ones are associated with the United States and are banned in North Korea .

The jeans were to be sold at Aplace , a retail space within the department store .
Mr. Stephansen said he had informed the shop ’s owner of the decision just before the planned launch .
A spokesman for Aplace called the decision “ a bit cowardly ” but said that he understood the department store ’s point of view .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is interviewed by POLITICO on Wednesday , January 27 , 2009 . | John Shinkle / POLITICO
Pelosi cool to Obama 's freeze plan
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that defense spending should n’t be exempt from President Barack Obama ’s proposal for a three - year freeze on federal spending .
In his State of the Union address Wednesday night , Obama is expected to address worries about the federal deficit by proposing a three - year freeze on all “ non-security ” spending .
But just hours before the speech , Pelosi told POLITICO that any spending freeze should be “ across the board . ”

“ Everybody has to make a sacrifice , ” the San Francisco Democrat said in an interview conducted as part of POLITICO ’s “ Inside Obama ’s Washington ” video series .
“ If you ’re asking everybody else in the country who has an interaction with the federal government — and that means our states and cities and all the rest , too — to cut back , then I think we have to subject every federal dollar to the very harshest scrutiny . ”
Pelosi , an early Iraq
War opponent who has championed increases in domestic spending programs , told POLITICO that it ’s “ hard to make the case ” to completely exempt the Pentagon from a spending freeze , saying that there has to be “ some room ” to cut “ 5 percent ” from the defense budget by targeting waste among contractors and the sprawling defense bureaucracy — provided such reductions had no direct impact on troops in the field , commanders or veterans .
Hill liberals , including Pelosi , have responded coolly to Obama ’s proposal , which could save as much as $ 250 billion over the next decade by freezing spending on discretionary domestic programs that are close to Democratic policy priorities .
On the flip side , congressional Republicans have blasted the move as a political window - dressing that will reduce the aggregate deficit by about 1 percent and do nothing to impede the explosive growth of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid .
For her part , Pelosi questioned the fairness of Obama ’s proposal , which is intended to shield spending on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars without arousing opposition from hawks .
“ Well , I think that if there is going to a spending freeze , it should be across the board .
That is to say , we all want a strong national defense , and we want to fund it in an appropriate way , ” she said .
“ But we ’re not here to protect defense contractors . …
And the fact is , if we have to cut spending , we should subject every dollar to that same scrutiny . ”

Married people in the United States are living longer these days , but the widowed are experiencing a higher mortality rate , according to new research by a Michigan State University sociologist .
The widening mortality gap between the two groups is a disturbing trend that should prompt scholars and politicians to seek out strategies to better protect and promote health for the widowed , said Hui Liu , study author and assistant professor of sociology .
Liu 's study , called " Till Death Do Us Part : Marital Status and U.S. Mortality Trends , 1986 - 2000 , " appears in the December issue of the Journal of Marriage and Family .
" It 's a bit surprising to me , " Liu said of the growing mortality rate for the widowed .
" With the improvements in medical technology , it seems all population groups should be healthier and living longer . "
Research from as far back as 1858 has shown that married people generally live longer than the nonmarried , but little is known how this relationship has changed over time in the United States .
Liu set out to explore recent trends in mortality by marital status .
She analyzed the data of more than a half - million people in the federal government 's National Health Interview Survey and found that , as expected , the overall mortality rate for married people decreased from 1986 to 2000 .
The rate also decreased or at least remained stable among all cause - specific deaths examined except diabetes , which saw an increase .
The mortality rate for the never - married also decreased , although it remained higher than that of married people .
But when it came to widowed people , the overall mortality rate increased .
This was especially true for white women .
The results echo another study by Liu and colleagues that found a significant decline in self - reported health among the widowed from 1972 to 2003 in the United States .
In general , widowhood is associated with reduced economic resources and loss of social support , which may contribute to a higher mortality risk , the new study says .
But the stress and emotional trauma of losing a spouse as a confidant might be greater now than in the past as the average duration of marriage becomes longer with increasing life expectancy , the study notes .
Further , men and women generally are losing their spouse later in life -- another factor that may contribute to a more frail widowed population .
" The growing mortality gap between the married and the unmarried , especially the widowed , raises concerns , " Liu said .
" As a frail population in terms of health status and mortality , the widowed clearly warrant greater research and policy attention . "

Olmec civilization emerged roughly 3,000 years ago in the eastern lowlands along Mexico's Gulf Coast in what is today the region of Veracruz and Tabasco .
In many ways it provided the foundation for all Mesoamerican art , much the way ancient Greek art did for subsequent European culture .
Still , Olmec society today remains very much a mystery .
For example , no one is quite sure what the monumental , 10 - ton stone sculptures of helmeted human heads were used for -- although it is certain that anybody who came upon one at a time when the wheel was not yet in use and carving implements were rudimentary would know he was in the jaw - dropping presence of extraordinary power .
So it 's exciting to learn that a major Olmec exhibition will inaugurate the new Lynda and Stewart Resnick Exhibition Pavilion when it opens in October ( exact date TBA ) at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art .
Only two major exhibitions of Olmec art have been seen in the United States -- one at Princeton , the other at the National Gallery -- both in the mid-1990s .
Many American museums , including LACMA , have some important Olmec objects on view , but the great survey collections are all in Mexico .
OSU Extension Catalog has a number of publications that provide comprehensive information related to food safety and food preservation ( see below ) .
In addition , we have included publications that are used by our Master Food Preservers for quick reference on a variety of topics , including :

Doug Ellison from UnmannedSpaceflight.com has done it again … and again … and again .
Here are new Mars flyover videos Doug has created from data from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Using DEM ( Digital Elevation Model ) – ( also known as DTM Digital Terrain Model ) files provided by the HiRISE team , Doug is able to render 3 - D movies of a specific location on Mars .
Since he is using actual high - resolution data from HiRISE , Doug says the terrain seen in the movies has accurate vertical scaling and is not exaggerated .
These new views of the Red Planet are also stunningly beautiful !
The video above is of the Mojave Crater wall on Mars , and below is Athabasca Valles .
And Doug says more are on the way !
If you recall , Doug created the flyover video of the Spirit rover ’s location that was on Astronomy Picture of the Day .
Doug says he is working on videos of Gale Crater , Bahram Vallis , Candor Chasma , Juventae Chasma , and more .
“ I ’m drowning in data ! ” he said via Twitter .
DEMs are a grid , or raster , file describing elevation values at regularly spaced points , or posts .
HiRISE DEMs are made from two high - resolution images of the same area , taken from different look angles by the spacecraft .
The HiRISE folks say that creating a DEM is complicated and involves sophisticated software and a lot of time , both computing time and man-hours .
However , DEMs are n’t just for making amazing movies or stunning 3 - D images .
DEMs are very powerful research tools , used to take measurements and model geological processes .
In fact , almost every HiRISE DEM produced results in a published paper .
Take a look at the DEM image and files from which the top video of Mojave Crater was made .
Read more about DEM files here from the HiRISE website .
And be sure to visit UnmannedSpaceflight.com to see all the wonderful images and videos created by Doug and many other very talented and avid fans of spaceflight .
Apple 's acquisition of Lala wo n't form the basis of any iTunes subscription service , but instead may help Apple quickly build a cloud - storage component into the next version of iTunes .
Apple will supposedly leverage Lala 's current music uploading technology to give users " anywhere access " to their music library .
Michael Robertson , guest writing at TechCrunch , cites a number of insider sources who say definitively that Apple will not offer a subscription option to the iTunes Store .
Instead , it will complement the current model with cloud storage , giving iTunes users the ability to " to navigate and play their music , videos and playlists from their personal URL using a browser based iTunes experience . "
Robertson , formerly the CEO of MP3.com , is currently the head of MP3tunes , which offers a cloud - storage service for music files similar to what he describes as the future of iTunes .
Such a strategy is one we speculated Apple would pursue , and one that sources for the Wall Street Journal also claimed would be wrapped into iTunes in a future update .
Obviously , Lala 's technology and engineering expertise , combined with a giant data center , could power such a feature .
Robertson suggests that doing so could make an end - run around having to negotiate additional streaming licenses from record labels , since each library would be linked to a specific customer .
" Apple will link the tens of millions of previously sold iPods , Touches , AppleTV and iTablets to mobile iTunes giving users seamless playback of their media from a wide range of Apple branded devices , " Robertson said .
" iTunes shoppers will be able to continue to buy music and movies as they can now , with purchases still being downloaded , but once downloaded they will be automatically loaded to their mobile iTunes area for anywhere access . "

Scientists have recorded a massive spike in the amount of a powerful greenhouse gas seeping from Arctic permafrost , in a discovery that highlights the risks of a dangerous climate tipping point .
Experts say methane emissions from the Arctic have risen by almost one - third in just five years , and that sharply rising temperatures are to blame .
The discovery follows a string of reports from the region in recent years that previously frozen boggy soils are melting and releasing methane in greater quantities .
Such Arctic soils currently lock away billions of tonnes of methane , a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide , leading some scientists to describe melting permafrost as a ticking time bomb that could overwhelm efforts to tackle climate change .
They fear the warming caused by increased methane emissions will itself release yet more methane and lock the region into a destructive cycle that forces temperatures to rise faster than predicted .
Paul Palmer , a scientist at Edinburgh University who worked on the new study , said : " High latitude wetlands are currently only a small source of methane but for these emissions to increase by a third in just five years is very significant .
It shows that even a relatively small amount of warming can cause a large increase in the amount of methane emissions . "
Global warming is occuring twice as fast in the Arctic than anywhere else on Earth .
Some regions have already warmed by 2.5C , and temperatures there are projected to increase by more than 10C by 2100 if carbon emissions continue to rise at current rates .
Palmer said : " This study does not show the Arctic has passed a tipping point , but it should open people 's eyes .
It shows there is a positive feedback and that higher temperatures bring higher emissions and faster warming . "
The change in the Arctic is enough to explain a recent increase in global methane levels in the atmosphere , he said .
Global levels have risen steadily since 2007 , after a decade or so holding steady .
The new study , published in the journal Science , shows that methane emissions from the Arctic increased by 31 % from 2003 - 07 .
The increase represents about 1 m extra tonnes of methane each year .
Palmer cautioned that the five - year increase was too short to call a definitive trend .
The findings are part of a wider study of methane emissions from global wetlands , such as paddy fields , marshes and bogs .
To identify where methane was released , the researchers combined methane levels in the atmosphere with surface temperature changes .
They did not measure methane emissions directly , but used satellite measurements of variations in groundwater depth , which alter the way bacteria break down organic matter to release or consume methane .
They found that just over half of all methane emissions came from the tropics , with some 20 m tonnes released from the Amazon river basin each year , and 26 m tonnes from the Congo basin .
Rice paddy fields across China and south and south - east Asia produced just under one - third of global methane , some 33 m tonnes .
Just 2 % of global methane comes from Arctic latitudes , the study found , though the region showed the largest increases .
The 31 % rise in methane emissions there from 2003 - 07 was enough to help lift the global average increase to 7 % .
Palmer said : " Our study reinforces the idea that satellites can pinpoint changes in the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from a particular place on earth .
This opens the door to quantifying greenhouse gas emissions made from a variety of natural and man-made sources . "
Palmer said it was a " disgrace " that so few satellites were launched to monitor levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane .
He said it was unclear whether the team would be able to continue the methane monitoring in future .
The pair of satellites used to analyse water , known as Grace , are already over their expected mission life time , while a European version launched last year , called Goce , is scheduled to fly for less than two years .
The new study follows repeated warnings that even modest levels of global warming could trigger huge increases in methane release from permafrost .
Phillipe Ciais , a researcher with the Laboratory for Climate Sciences and the Environment in Gif- sur - Yvette , France , told a scientific meeting in Copenhagen last March that billions of tonnes could be released by just a 2C average global rise .
More on methane
While carbon dioxide gets most of the attention in the global warming debate , methane is pound - for - pound a more potent greenhouse gas , capable of trapping some 20 times more heat than CO2 .
Although methane is present in much lower quantities in the atmosphere , its potency makes it responsible for about one - fifth of man-made warming .
The gas is found in natural gas deposits and is generated naturally by bacteria that break down organic matter , such as in the guts of farm animal .
About two - thirds of global methane comes from man-made sources , and levels have more than doubled since the industrial revolution .
Unlike carbon dioxide , methane lasts only a decade or so in the atmosphere , which has led some experts to call for greater attention to curbs on its production .
Reductions in methane emissions could bring faster results in the fight against climate change , they say .
Artist Bio
Xue Jiye , one of China ’s most important contemporary artists , is a creative surrealist painter , full of ideas .
“ I have too many things in my mind , I just do n’t have enough time to paint them all , ” says the artist .
The North - eastern Chinese painter and sculptor captivates viewers with his imagination and visionary power .
Xue does not like to be classified as a particular kind or type of painter .
He says that it is important for artists to depict things in their own unique and original artist ’s language .
Xue ’s style has evolved a lot over the past 10 years .
And he predicts more changes in the future .
But the artist is consistent in the purpose of his paintings – he paints because he has the urge to paint .
And the subject matter of his paintings emerges from that need .
When creating , Xue prefers to allow himself a lot of freedom .
“ I work in a surreal style in my paintings because it gives me more space . ”
The artist says that “ reality has become boring , ” and he feels numb from society .
So his mind stretches beyond reality into the world of dreams and imagination .
In his latest series of paintings , Xue depicts the human condition – a constant struggle for existence within human society .
The figures in the paintings are all nudes , indicating that they are defenceless and vulnerable .
Some of them are exerting all of their energy to hold themselves up , suspended between the two ends of the painting .
In one set of paintings , the figure is gradually restricted between the edges of the paintings until he does not even have enough space to breathe or move .
These pieces indicate men ’s futile struggle against the powerful forces of society , which is surrounding them , as the edges of the paintings are confining the figures .
Even if one tries to escape from society , it will eventually constrain and constrict us all .
Human beings throughout history also participate in another kind of “ struggle ” : battles .
The nude battling male figures in Xue ’s paintings all look the same , indicating that with no uniforms , one cannot even know which side each participant is on or even what they are fighting for – essentially the people struggling are all the same .
This also makes the battle timeless and strips down war to its most basic meaning : members of society destroying other members of society .
The purpose and the result do not matter to Xue , for there are always excuses in society for battle .
What the artist cares about is the process , the unending pressures from society to fight .
Xue ’s paintings have also been strongly influenced by his own sculpture work .
Certain pieces are of men chiselling forms out of large rock masses and men interacting with different objects sculpted out of stone .
The artist , too , brings form to solid , hard and motionless objects in his sculptures .
It is almost like being God and creating life .
In some of Xue Jiye ’s paintings , tiny , uniform naked figures inhabit giant building structures , swarming throughout the canvas like ants , running up and down gigantic stairs , fighting , carrying building material , hollowing out caves , digging subterranean corridors , building huge sculptures and buildings or hammering and carving geometrical shapes out of stone .
The movement of the persons seems directionless , just as the often monumental buildings appear to have been built without any practical purpose .
This also reflects human societies : from ancient Egypt ’s pyramids to modern Chinese buildings , it is the workers , dominated by society , who must all toil together to create gigantic monuments .
Xue ’s paintings of solitary figures are also engaged in similarly futile actions : suspended between the paintings ’ borders , building towers out of red square blocks or sitting on the floor , lost in thought , they seem to be involved in some sort of existential struggle .
“ The people in my paintings are just like tools I use them to build a new and different work , ” says Xue .
All of Xue Jiye ’s male figures are depicted nude , with muscular bodies and proportionally large hands and feet .
The nudity can be seen as a reduction to basic human characteristics , not as an individual person in a certain time , but as a human being in general .
Xue uses and reuses the same nondescript nude male figure .
Who is this character ?
He is the most basic form of man , he is no taller , shorter , lighter or darker than his neighbour .
He is the man from the past , the present , the future .
He is from the East and from the West , indicating that after breaking it down , societies are essentially all the same .
Similarly there is no indication as to the background ; the men are depicted in empty dark brown - black spaces .
The human bodies and the buildings are illustrated in red tones , contrasting strongly with the dark backgrounds , which give them an almost glowing quality .
This helps to evoke an impression of a visionary world , which is a mixture between Stone Age and the future ; the buildings are reminiscent of ancient advanced cultures and science fiction movies at the same time .
Xue Jiye explains that life in society has made us all more and more numb .
“ Things that were once special have now become ordinary , boring and mundane ” .
His paintings take basic human actions and put them in imaginary contexts that mirror our real society – like science fiction .
Through this the artist shows a neutral view of society , which could almost be labelled as his own disenchantment with existence .
Xue ’s works show us that human society leads us to conformity , since when people exist together , everyone ends up attaching importance to a uniform set of ideas and values .
No matter how much one struggles within Xue ’s work or in reality , there is no escaping basic human conditions and society .

THE LONG - awaited vote on New York state 's same - sex marriage bill finally came December 2 -- and resulted in a resounding 38 - to - 24 defeat for equal rights , confusing and angering supporters who thought the measure would pass .
The bill to legalize same - sex marriage in New York was supported by every statewide elected official , and had been approved by New York 's other legislative body , the State Assembly , three times already , each time by a wider margin .
Democrats Thomas Duane , the state senator who sponsored the bill , and Gov. David Paterson , who called a special session to force the Senate to debate and vote on this and other measures , had repeatedly said they believed they had the votes to pass the legislation .
But the slim Democratic majority in the Senate split in the vote , with eight Democrats joining a unanimous Republican bloc in opposing the measure .
Duane claimed after the vote that several colleagues broke their promise to vote against equality .
The defeat in New York was the second blow to the LGBT equality movement in as many months .
In Maine , voters narrowly approved a ballot measure repealing same - sex marriage after it had been granted legislatively earlier in the year .
Seven states achieved marriage since 2003 , either legislatively or with a court ruling , but statewide referendums stripped those rights in California last November and Maine last month .
Now , the focus shifts to New Jersey , where the legislature is expected to vote on a same - sex marriage bill this week .
As in New York , a few months ago , the marriage equality measure was expected to pass , and be signed into law by Gov. Jon Corzine .
But since the election , which Corzine lost , a number of Democrats have jumped ship .
The religious right was quick to gloat after the New York vote .
In a letter to donors , National Organization for Marriage ( NOM ) Executive Director Brian Brown wrote : " This great victory will reverberate up and down America , putting the fear of God -- and the American voter - - into the hearts of weak - kneed and weak - willed politicians everywhere . "
NOM is furiously soliciting funds to devote to the battle over equal marriage in New Jersey .
Yet public opinion on marriage equality is in stark contrast to both the right wing 's triumphalism and the legislative setback in New York .
A Marist Institute opinion poll released the same day as the state Senate vote showed 51 percent of registered New York voters supporting same - sex marriage , and 42 percent opposed .
LGBT New Yorkers and their allies were upset , but not silenced , in the wake of the vote .
Hundreds came out to an impromptu Times Square protest hours afterward , where the names of the Democrats who voted against the bill were called out one by one , with boos after each .
At another protest the next day , over a thousand people flooded Union Square to express their outrage at the Senate 's decision .
Paterson and Duane both spoke .
" I 'm pissed off , " Eugene Lovendusky , a 24 - year - old teacher who has lived in New York for three years , told Gay City News .
" I come from California , and I 'm already a second - class citizen there .
Now I 'm a second - class citizen here .
I do n't know where I can call home . "
IF THERE was a bright spot in what happened , it was the Senate debate on the legislation -- which showed a very different picture from the conventional wisdom that African Americans are leading opponents of same - sex marriage .
The Senate 's Black and female members showed the greatest support for the bill , repeatedly summoning parallels from past civil rights struggles during their speeches .
State Sen. Eric Adams of Brooklyn said : " I have religious beliefs , but when I walk through those doors , my Bible stays out .
You do n't have to be gay to respect that two people who meet and fall in love deserve to be married .
You do n't have to be Black to understand the pain of slavery . "
Harlem state Sen . Bill Perkins directed his comments to same - sex marriage supporters in the gallery , saying , " Thank you , movement .
Thank you for your vigilance and your push to get us where we are today ... I can see Dr. Martin Luther King smiling down on us today , recognizing that his sacrifice was not in vain . "
But it was fellow Democrats who provided the margin of victory for the right .
State Sen. Rubén Díaz Sr. , a conservative Pentecostal minister representing the Bronx , who claims his opposition to same - sex marriage is " nothing personal , " was the only senator -- Republican or Democrat -- to speak against the bill .
Díaz 's opposition was expected , but the other Democrats who sided with the Republicans against equal rights were the key to dooming the bill .
The protests that took place in New York after the Senate vote -- like the national demonstrations after the referendum defeats for equality in Maine and California - - will be important in keeping the movement going and showing how the tide can be turned .
The emphasis on lobbying by organizations like Empire State Pride Agenda turned out to be misplaced .
The $ 1 million - plus funneled toward winning legislative support for marriage equality did n't even get us close in the state Senate .
The key to regaining momentum in the struggle for LGBT equality -- on marriage and every other question -- will depend on the struggle from below .
We need a movement that goes beyond the state - by - state lobbying focus of established LGBT organizations to demand that the federal government act on equality before the law .
In 1786 , the new democratic government of the United States of America was n’t quite working out like some Revolutionary War veterans had expected .
Many had not been paid for their military service in local state militias or the Continental Army as promised .
And , when they went back to their family farms , they found they were subject to heavy new state taxes imposed to help pay off government war debts owed to rich merchants .
Many farmers who could n’t afford to pay their taxes and other debts had their farms seized and were sentenced to serve time a debtors ’ prison .
In response , angry veterans in Massachusetts began joining together to take over and shut down local courts .
One group of vets tried to take over the Springfield armory .
This mini-revolt — called “ Shays ’ Rebellion ” after one of its leaders , Daniel Shays — was quickly and forcefully crushed by the Massachusetts state militia , under orders from Governor James Bowdoin .
In the confrontation at the Springfield armory , four Shaysites were killed and twenty wounded .
The rest fled .
Eventually hundreds were rounded up and indicted .
Some were sent to prison .
Eighteen were sentenced to be hanged , as recommended by Founding Father Samuel Adams .
Drawing a somewhat arbitrary distinction between governments with and without kings at the top , Adams said :
“ Rebellion against a king may be pardoned , or lightly punished , but the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death . ”
Adams ’ fellow Founding Father Thomas Jefferson , who was in Paris at the time , agreed that there was a distinction between a monarchy and America ’s new system of government .
However , his view of the anti-tax uprising in Massachusetts was less harsh .
In fact , two of Jefferson ’s most famous ( and arguably most misused ) quotations are from letters he wrote about Shays ’ Rebellion .
One of those oft - cited quotes — “ I hold it that a little rebellion , now and then , is a good thing ” — was in a letter he wrote to James Madison on January 30 , 1787 .
Jefferson said in the letter that a democratic government like America ’s “ has a great deal of good in it .
The mass of mankind under that enjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness .
It has its evils , too , the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject .
But weigh this against the oppressions of monarchy , and it becomes nothing . ”
He added :
“ I hold it that a little rebellion , now and then , is a good thing , and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical .
Unsuccessful rebellions , indeed , generally establish the encroachments on the rights of the people , which have produced them .
An observation of this truth should render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions , as not to discourage them too much .
It is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government . ”
Later that same year , Jefferson penned another famous quote that referred to Shays ’ Rebellion :
In a letter to Col. William Smith , dated November 13 , 1787 , he said :
“ The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . ”
Both of Jefferson ’s famous quotes about Shays ’ Rebellion are still frequently cited by people who are “ mad as hell ” about something the government has done .
Today , relatively few people actually believe that the sentiments Jefferson expressed should be interpreted and acted out literally , through a violent revolution .
Some anti-gun control protesters who carry signs referring to Jefferson ’s “ tree of liberty ” quote apparently do .
So , apparently , did the anti-government “ rump militia ” members who occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge .
I wonder how many of them know what happened to the Shaysite rebels Jefferson was referring to when he wrote that line .

Loretta Napoleoni and the global economics of terrorism
Loretta Napoleoni gave the following talk at TED last summer .
Napoleoni , a macroeconomist whose introduction to terrorism and money came through interviewing the Italian Red Brigades , demonstrates the intricate linkage of world finance and terrorist moneymaking .
She also suggests the primary activity of terror networks is not politics or violence , but the raising of capital , which , in turn , funds the violence to further political ends .
Loretta Napoleoni is an Italian born economist , author , journalist and political analyst .
“ She is an expert on the financing of terrorism and is well known internationally for having calculated the size of the terror economy ” ( Wikipedia ) .
Among other books , Napoleoni has authored Terror Incorporated and Rouge Economics , both available below the video .
Note : Her English is good , but her accent is still heavy and she has the cadence of a holiness preacher .
She ’s tough to understand at times .

Now that cold season has started , it may be time to take some symptoms off the COVID - 19 checklist , says New Brunswick 's chief medical officer of health .
Dr. Jennifer Russell said her colleagues from across the country have talked about " streamlining " testing requirements to avoid a logjam of tests for people who end up simply having a cold .
Several of the symptoms for COVID - 19 overlap those of the common cold , including runny nose , sore throat , and headache .
Those are three of the 10 symptoms British Columbia removed last week .
" I know there 's a level of confusion and again , we are working on it , " said Russell .
She said the system can handle the current situation , but if there 's a spike in COVID - 19 cases in New Brunswick , then the checklist may have to be scaled back .
" So we 're happy with where we are , but I think as we move into a time frame where the risks are going to be higher in terms of case numbers possibly increasing as we are seeing around the country , then I think it merits having that discussion , " Russell said Tuesday afternoon .
She said there 's been " a surge in demand " for COVID - 19 testing since children returned to the classroom .
There were 837 more tests done for those under 20 during the first two full weeks of school than there were for the entire month before that , according to figures supplied by the department .
The age group went from representing 27 per cent of all tests done in the month before to 43 per cent in the first two full weeks of classes .
Schools are required to send students home when they display two or more symptoms of COVID - 19 .
Those children are then required to self - isolate at home until a negative test is received .
Days off sick up 132 % in Anglophone SouthWhile a spokesperson for the Department of Education did not provide numbers when asked about school absences on Tuesday , the superintendent of the Anglophone South School District did .
Zoë Watson explained that absences are coded based on a variety of reasons , including illness or medical appointment .
She said the code for illness at K - 8 was used 132 per cent more this month than in September 2019 .
Russell said Public Health has responded to the increase in demand by adding staff , increasing hours and making other changes , such as prioritizing call - backs for children .
Russell said New Brunswick 's testing capacity " is where we want it to be , " but the length of time to notify people of their test results got bogged down by the increased demand .
The goal had been 72 hours , but Russell said it was taking longer than that .
Without mandatory masks , Infection control epidemiologist Colin Furness predicts that New Brunswick will see a lot more respiratory viruses .
" I 'm expecting more cold and flu in New Brunswick than I am in ... Toronto , " he said .
Since masks are mandatory in the Toronto area , he said , it 's unlikely that the area will see many colds and flus , so any respiratory symptoms would have to be taken very seriously .
" So in Ontario , I would say anything that looks like a respiratory illness is scary .
In New Brunswick , I would say that ' Well , a cold is probably just a cold . ' "
Given the low case counts , Furness said masks are likely a hard sell in New Brunswick , but it 's the best way to avoid students having to get a COVID - 19 test every time they catch a cold .
" Your best way forward as a parent is to try and make sure that no one catches any cold at all .
That 's harder to do when people are n't wearing masks , " he said .
" If I were a parent in New Brunswick , I would be doubling down on hand sanitizer and physical distancing and all the things that we know work to keep us from getting sick — and flu shots for sure .
" Furness said the stress that parents feel when their child gets sick in New Brunswick would be different from what parents in Ontario may feel .
Here , it 's not a genuine fear of COVID - 19 , it 's the hassle of having to prove that it 's not .
" It becomes a headache rather than this fear , " he said .
Whether it stays on the COVID - 19 checklist or not , Furness said one of the most common symptoms at this time of the year is n't a great indicator of COVID - 19 anyway .
" COVID in kids tends to present asymptomatically — a runny nose is not associated with COVID , " he said .
" That 's not to say that it 's impossible for someone with a runny nose to have COVID .
You can also have more than one virus at a time .
But kids are typically asymptomatic .
And so the whole concept of screening is a little bit misplaced .
" Yukon offers guideYukon health officials have recently come up with a colour - coded system to help parents .
Green means go to school .
That 's when a child has no symptoms , or only symptoms of a previously - diagnosed condition .
Yellow means a child has some symptoms and should stay home for 24 hours to see whether the symptoms resolve .
They include a runny nose , fever , fatigue , sore throat , vomiting or diarrhea .
A runny nose or congestion that persists , but is relatively mild and not worsening , means a child can go back to school after 24 hours — so long as they have no other symptoms .
Vomiting or diarrhea , however , warrant keeping students home until those symptoms are gone .
Red means a child has symptoms that warrant a COVID - 19 test — or they could stay in self - isolation for at least 10 days before returning to school .
" Red " symptoms include coughing , a fever , shortness of breath or difficulty breathing , and loss of taste or smell .
British Columbia shortens list
The list of symptoms in British Columbia was shortened last week to remove many that overlap with the common cold , including sore throat , runny nose , headache , and fatigue .
" This was a recommendation from public health to remove some of the symptoms , given the very low probability of these symptoms by themselves indicating COVID , " B.C. 's Ministry of Health said in an emailed statement to CBC .
" They are also very common in children , so there are concerns that it would unnecessarily exclude children , " said the ministry .
The following symptoms have been removed from the daily checklist : * Sore throat * Runny / stuffy nose * Headache * Fatigue * Loss of appetite * Muscle aches * Conjunctivitis ( pink eye ) * Dizziness , confusion * Abdominal pain * Skin rash or discolouration of fingers and toesParents are now asked to screen children for the following symptoms : * Fever * Chills * Cough or worsening of chronic cough * Shortness of breath * Loss of sense of smell or taste * Diarrhea * Nausea and vomiting
We beat the snow .
Our oil is in .
And an odd thing has happened to us : we 've learned how to do something .
I can't remember the last time I actually learned a skill .
Possibly it was wiring a plug .
Fanning an avocado ?
Is that a skill ?
But now if someone were to turn to me and ask ( as might happen , perhaps , in a Post Office queue ) , " do you know how to make your own olive oil ? "
I could answer : " yes , madam , indeed I do " .
And from under my coat I would bring a litre bottle of our second batch and hold it to the light .
" Look at the hue ! " I would say .
" Have you ever seen such a … "
" Cashier number 4 , please . "
Oh God , I 've become an olive bore .
It 's what comes from thinking about nothing else for a month .
Angsting over maggots , flapping over quotas , weighing bucket after bucket on bathroom scales , picking olives , processing olives , dreaming about olives .
Loving olives , hating olives ...
Our losses to frost were heavy - it claimed dozens of boughs on the shadier terraces , turning the fruits a soft and sickly brown .
Our other great enemy is the worm .
There are two distinct pests : one white and wiggly , the other a small , tan - coloured pupa the size of a rice grain .
We hate them both .
When we 've gone to the lagar to book ourselves a slot , we 've examined some of the sacks sitting ready to be pressed and seen hundreds of the damned things slicking around the inside of the plastic .
Most lagars give the olives a wash before crushing , but that 'll only get rid of the maggots that have left their holes .
Most will be sitting quietly inside as the screws tighten , wondering why their home has become suddenly smaller .
So this is one thing we 've learned : the olive oil you 've just drizzled on your couscous ?
It 's worm oil .
The worms , I suppose , are 99 % olive , but that does n't get away from the fact : olive oil is 1 % worm .
Probably more if it 's organic .

Our olives have been relatively maggot free , but the later you pick , the more pestilent your crop .
We became perfectionists , rolling each olive across our palms , checking for rot , mould , holes … becoming paranoid lest a single flawed
fruit contaminate our haul – fussing out every leaf and twig , having been told , grimly , by the lady in the agricultural shop that not a single stalk should reach the press .
Progress was slow .
We were hunched around a log fire , on tiny wooden stools , working with kitchen sieves and cereal bowls , tossing stalks and maggots and substandard olives into the flames .
We went slightly mad .
Briefly , chaotically , our house turned into a 19th century sorting factory , with leaves everywhere , twigs everywhere , buckets and sacks and trays and bowls and boxes of olives EVERYWHERE .
Everything was olive stained : our hands , our nets , our clothes , the floorboards .
We thought about manufacturing a linen dye from olive juice .
We thought about giving up .
For a brief time , I could measure my life in olive tubs .
Every tub was 10kg , four tubs to fill a sack , then onto the next .
And the next .
And the next .
The first pressing , at Pedrógão Pequeno , we sorted completely by hand .
We loaded the car at 5.30 am in pitch darkness having booked the first slot of the day .
Although once at the lagar , the first slot mysteriously became the second slot , which became the fifth slot , and slipped again .
Various trucks , vans and tractors slid in ahead of us for reasons we were far from fathoming .
We shuffled about , smiling at the operatives , then were suddenly summoned to the weighing machine .
216 kilos , well above the 150 minimum .
The conveyor belts rumbled into life , the sacks were split , and away into the bowels of the beast went our precious haul .
Sacks of olives ready for the press .

This was a modern press .
State of the art , EU regulation , all gleaming pipes and digital displays .
It took half an hour for our oil to emerge , hot and yellow from the centrifuge .
21 litres , so almost exactly a litre from every 10 kilos , ( with every 10 kilos costing a euro to press ) .
Is this good ?
We have no idea .
We drove back , proud but weary , to tear some bread and taste our blessed oil .
The first harvest from the quinta , the finest olive oil , doubtless , that the Iberian peninsula has ever produced .
It was insipid .
There 's no getting away from it .
Insipid .
It tasted like oil .
Warm oil .
Warm oil that had taken us hours and days and weeks and half our sanity to produce .
" Good cooking oil " I suggested to Hannah .
She nodded , and made a suggestion of her own : " we could burn it in lamps . "
We thought about our oil .
We thought what might have gone wrong .
It was a modern press and came highly recommended .
Our olives were as clean and twigless as ever a batch has been .
Then we realised : it was the colour .
Our sacks were blacker than anyone else 's .
Our olives were overripe .
We 'd taken only the ripest from the trees , and set aside the green for pickling .
Now , everyone will tell you something different about the optimum green - black split .
The lady in the agricultural shop who'd sold us our olive combs , who 'd warned us against a single stalk tainting our oil , was insistent : the olives must be 100 % black .
Online , the commonest ratio seems to be 3 black to 1 green .
I think her advice was bad .
The green olives give the oil its peppery taste – this seems to be the consensus .
So , a few things changed for our second pressing .
We upped the number of greens , relaxed about stalks , and we crumbled and bought a sorting machine .
Never have 277 euros been better spent .
We tore through our backlog .
What was taking us an hour suddenly took us a quarter .
The second attempt at pressing was at Mosteiro , a small village half an hour away .
It was a traditional , steam - powered press , crushing the olives between raffia mats on century - old hydraulic screws .
Or so we were told .
When we got there we could see the magnificent old press , rusting in pieces on the forecourt , piles of rush mats rotting in the rain .
They 'd just had a refit .
So much for comparing new with old .
The second batch of oil emerges from the press .

But still , it was a smaller , more intimate affair .
Every bit as baffling as the first , but friendlier , as countless other people were ushered in ahead of us .
It was past midnight , and everyone had gone home happy with their oil , except for one man who had brought a basket of chicken wings and a box of wine to make an evening of it .
He liked the look of our olives , and gave us some chicken .
At last , just when we were giving up hope , a young fellow leapt into a forklift truck , and our olives were loaded onto the scales .
572kg .
A cool half tonne .
And from this 76 litres was squeezed .
A better ratio , but what about the oil ?
The fellow with the chicken wings nodded approvingly as it trickled out into our plastic churn : " muito bom , muito bom . "
He was drunk , but it did n't seem like he was blowing smoke up our buckets .
The proof was in the tasting .
A glass each of hot oil .
A sniff , a sip , and a warm , peppery sigh of relief .
It was absolutely gorgeous .
Really , properly delicious .
76 litres of green and gutsy joy .
Noticeably greener than the first batch , and incalculably better .
I 'm not just saying this because we worked so hard to bring it into being , but it 's the best olive oil I 've ever tasted .
Every time I taste it , days later , I think , " muito bom " .
This is our olive oil for the year .
So much for labelling it " single estate " and hawking it at a farmer 's market .
This is for personal use .
Tasting the second batch .

Driving around the countryside , we 've seen half of Portugal up ladders , up trees , huffing nets in the rain and bumping around on top of olive sacks behind a tractor .
I 'm very aware that we 've only just dipped the corner of our bread into a tradition that runs deep through the valleys of Portugal , and stains the lives of the people .
If a little knowledge is a dangerous thing , then we are the deadliest olive farmers in all of Castelo Branco .
We have been schooled ( to primary school level ) in the ancient alchemy of the harvest , witnessed and engaged in the heaving transformation of sack upon sack of black and mottled olives into the glorious green gold of the oil .
We have stood triumphant over half a tonne of plucked prey , torn the fruitstained smocks from our chests and howled our knowledge at the harvest moon : " This thing of nature I acknowledge mine ! "
Then picked up our smocks and gone inside because it 's freezing .
So that was our harvest .
Blooded by the juice of a hundred boot - squashed olives , we are no longer quite the ingénues we once were .
Our techniques – for emptying nets , spotting maggots , clipping treetops – all these have sharpened .
And yet , the pruning of an olive tree is a fine art to which our crude hackings can only aspire , I 've just discovered that many people round here trample the olives ( black and green ) , let them half ferment and pour off the juice before taking them to the press .
The knack of hefting a wet olive sack still eludes me , and the inner workings of the olive press remain a mystery of Delphic proportions .
Next year we 'll take chicken wings and some wine .
Maybe that gets you bumped up the list .
The Religious Right Supports Affirmative Action
I ca n’t believe it .
Several prominent folks from the religious right are coming out strongly in support of the idea that a job candidate ’s qualifications can be eclipsed in importance by demographic issues .
If you think that I am making this up , think again .
Here ’s Matt Barber Director of Cultural Affairs from the Liberty ( HA ! ) Counsel :
He may very well be qualified for this position , but …
Of course , I am taking his quotation out of context for the time being to show that Barber thinks it ’s appropriate to judge issues other than a job candidate ’s qualification for the job in question .
So what ’s all this about ?
Barack Obama has appointed Amanda Simpson as the Senior Technical Advisor to the U.S. Department of Commerce .
Simpson has an M.S. in engineering , an M.B.A. , and an undergraduate degree in physics .
She has 30 years ’ experience in private aerospace and defense work .
Her job at Commerce is to oversee the export of weapons to foreign countries .
Given her credentials , this should be right in her wheelhouse .
Case closed .
Right ?
Well , not to the theocrats on the right .
They object to Simpson because she is transgender .
Here ’s Barber in context :
He may very well be qualified for this position but it appears that he was not picked ( merely ) for his qualifications , he was picked because of his wardrobe .
That is not diversity or tolerance .
It ’s political correctness run amok .
Peter LaBarbara from Americans for Truth ( HA ! )
About Homosexuality added this :
Is there going to be a transgender quota now in the Obama administration ?
How far does this politics of gay and transgender activism go ?
Clearly this is an administration that is pandering to the gay lobby .
Obama is pandering to the gay lobby by hiring someone to do a job for which she is qualified .
Ostensibly , Barber and LaBarbera would prefer that Obama hired someone else for the position because of their gripes with Simpson ’s gender .
Note that they have no complaints with her qualifications .
Sounds like affirmative action to me .
When we look back on this in 50 years , it will be similar to the way we now feel about the racists who threw black cats on the field to protest and harass Jackie Robinson .
In the bright light of history , this primitive and ugly behavior will appear withered and rotten to almost everybody .
Update : I almost forgot .
The article I used as a source comes from the Catholic News Agency .
The news agency of an organization whose leadership is comprised of old virgin men .
Of all the people to gripe about transgendered people , I ’d think that the organization with that kink built into its hierarchy would be a little more understanding of sexual behavior that deviates from the norm .
It ’s time to share another chuckle , this time via the good people at LOL god :
Predicting flames in 3 … 2 … ;)
The shuttle is retiring next year and , according to NASA , the remaining five flights may be the most difficult ever flown .
That 's why they created this contest for the final space shuttle patch .
One of these will be the winner :

Among other activities , they organized the final mission patch contest to make NASA employees more involved and concentrate on the missions ahead .
The entries — a total of 85 — were created by all shuttle program members , from technicians to astronauts .
Fifteen of these will go into a voting web page , where NASA employees would be able to vote .
The favorite — although this could be vetoed by NASA 's top brass — will be the final mission patch .
My bet is hidden in the gallery , but looking at it , it 's clearly perfect NASA patch material .

In summer , the Grand Canyon is all crowds and traffic jams .
In winter you can have one of the most awe - inspiring places in the world to yourself
' I have heard rumours of visitors who were disappointed , " JB Priestley once said about the Grand Canyon .
" The same people will be disappointed at the Day of Judgment . "
I have to confess I was disappointed on my first visit to the canyon , more than a decade ago .
One July , on our way to Los Angeles , my family and I swung off the highway , made the 60 - mile detour to the South Rim , and found ourselves caught in a long traffic jam .
When we eventually managed to park , and walked to the rim , the scale of the sight off the edge was so great it was hard to muster a response .
It was so vast , and so familiar from pictures , it might just as well have been a picture .
What impressed me most was the Babel of languages audible among the visitors pouring off the tour buses .
It sounded like Times Square on a Saturday night , with every continent represented in the hubbub .
At this magnitude , scale is deceptive .
Pedro de Castañeda , a Spaniard on the Coronado expedition of 1540 , whose members were among the first Europeans ever to see the canyon , reported that a group of them scrambled some way down , and found that boulders they 'd seen from the rim were not as they'd thought , the height of a man , but " taller than the great tower in Seville " ( presumably the Giralda Tower , nearly 100 m high ) .
We only stayed an hour or two .
But before we left , from the rim I saw a trail , pale as chalk , winding down a huge slope beneath a cliff .
There 's something about a trail seen from far away .
That thread snaking over the landscape – where does it go , who uses it , why does it seem so intimate with the land ?
And why does it arouse such an intense longing to follow it ?
An unknown path seems almost necessarily a metaphor .
We like to conceive of life as a thread , after all , a path crossing unexpected terrain on its journey to another element .
When the trail winds across empty desert , up and down huge hillsides – as in the Grand Canyon – it's all the more insistently allegorical .
There was n't time to follow it , and I left with a nagging sense of opportunity lost , and that pale thread of a path still pulling at me .
It was n't until last winter that I got to answer that pull .
And the first thing I learned is that with the Grand Canyon , winter is the time to go .
As the chief district ranger , John Evans , told me , " You 'll more or less have the place to yourself . "
Although the canyon is a desert , it 's like an oasis in winter – a place of peace , sequestered from the rest of the world .
In three days of hiking I saw only two or three mule trains , each carrying baggage , not riders , and perhaps two dozen hikers .
Winter is cool , and cool is good for hiking .
It 's true there 's snow on the trails , and long - moulded tongues of ice pounded into enamel - like smoothness by the mules that go up and down with supplies , but that 's only on the highest reaches .
Drop 500 m from the rim and you 'll probably be free of it .
Sunlight becomes a blessing instead of a 50 C curse when you step out of chill shade into some welcome warmth .
To experience the canyon , you have to leave the rim .
The frustration aroused by the bigness , the grandness , on a rim - only visit becomes a liberation once you drop down .
The modern world falls away .
It 's a trip not just out of the human realm , but into the deep geology of the earth .
Layer upon layer of the planet 's crust is revealed , stratum by stratum : the Toroweap limestone , the Coconino sandstone , the Redwall limestone , the Tonto Group ; the Vishnu schist deep down , close to two billion years old , nearly half the total age of the planet – the stuff that is under our very feet as we go about our lives is laid bare here .
And in the silence and stillness , in the solitude of the canyon in winter , it 's all the more impressive .
Teddy Roosevelt said that all Americans should try to see it .
He also declared : " We have gotten past the stage , my fellow citizens , when we are to be pardoned if we treat any part of our country as something to be skinned . "
Alas , he had no idea what was coming .
But the Grand Canyon has not yet been skinned .
Though not for want of trying .
As I prepared to go , and talked to friends about the trip , I was amazed how many people knew the inner canyon well .
One acquaintance told me he had spent 300 nights below the rim , falling just short of a lifetime 's ambition of a full year .
In a grocery store in Santa Fe , where I live , I got talking with a Grand Canyon - crazy runner who hikes from rim to rim in a single day several times a year .
A woman in a coffee shop told me about the time a 10lb falling rock nearly knocked her off a trail .
I began to get the feeling that the Grand Canyon is truly a national monument , analogous to the Lake District in its centrality to the nation 's psyche .
" Each man sees himself in the Grand Canyon , " Carl Sandburg said .
It 's something all Americans share , and can take pride in .
This was all very well , but the canyon is a mile deep , and the trail itself about 10 miles long , and that translates to a very arduous walk , especially for an eight - year - old .
By some arcane family algebra , it was the turn of Saul , our younger son , to come with me .
After an impossibly smooth two - hour ride in the vintage coaches of the Grand Canyon Railway from the town of Williams , Arizona , the nearest major settlement south of the canyon , we checked in at Bright Angel Lodge near the canyon rim , to reconfirm our bookings for Phantom Ranch , down in the bottom .
The woman behind the desk glanced at my son and said : " I hope you 're planning to leave immediately , if not sooner . "
It was already 1 pm , and most hikers set off in the morning .
My heart dropped .
Saul is strong , fit as an Olympic athlete , indomitable as a Gaul , but still only eight .
Was it crazy and cruel to ask him to walk down and then up a whole mile of elevation ?
What if , having got him down , he hurt himself , or his feisty spirit gave out ?
And what if my own legs failed me ?
The fear amplified during the first spectacular mile of trail , where we had to pick our way precariously over ice .
But then we were out on the spine of a ridge , the aptly nicknamed Ooh - Aah Point , that dropped precipitately to either side , and the ice was all melted away .
Here , it was n't so much about looking at a view as being in the midst of one .
As we gazed around us , two condors came gliding right over , so close we could hear the wind ruffling their feathers .
" Keep in the middle , " I implored Saul , as he took to scampering along the parapet of rocks .
Apparently , kids can't resist a parapet , no matter the drop beyond it .
I would n't want a creationist to misinterpret this , but I always find geology more or less unbelievable .
Were these hundreds of square miles of limestone hundreds of feet deep truly formed by trillions of marine creatures dying ?
Could a river really carve out a gash this deep ?
But before the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam , in a single day the Colorado River used to carry away 380,000 tonnes or more of silt , enough to fill a train 25 miles long .
Each day .
A river this size is indeed an efficient grinding tool .
Below us , sweeping brown plateaux bulged as if they were soft upholstery .
There were cliffs of blue , pink , orange , mauve , and deep purple bands of rock – the banners of God , as an early explorer said .
True enough , the stark minerality of the desert always seems to arouse the inner mystic .
The scientist John Strong Newberry , part of an 1857 expedition to the canyon , said : " Nowhere on the earth 's surface , so far as we know , are the secrets of its structure revealed as here . "
After the cliffs of pale Coconino limestone , we descend the Redwall limestone , into a deep tub of crimson stone .
Finally , at Skeleton Point , we catch the first glimpse of the river , thousands of feet below , announced by a distant roar .
A vast sweep of shadow is coming off the rim above , spreading over the Tonto plateau .
We plunged in and out of the shade on the switchbacks .
So far , we had seen just four people .
Then , just after Tipoff Point , the path brought us to another dizzying corner , overlooking an ancient rusty amphitheatre of Tonto Group rock one way , while to the other , the air drops away to another sight of the Colorado River far , far below , clay - red , rippling , bloated .
One of the two suspension bridges down there was visible , too .
It all looked like a telephoto shot , the unfamiliar vertical distance baffling the eye .
Around 4 pm , when we 'd descended around 1,200 m , deep in the echoing inner canyon , amid runnels and gullies of deep shadow , beneath shoulders of shale and scree , Saul got a kind of oxygen narcosis , skipping around , singing " Blue - blue - blue - blue " from Austin Powers , while my left knee went supersonic , screeching at me to please take one pace up instead of down .
Then Saul discovered the echo deep in the billion - year - old rock .
" Go away , echo ! " he shouted vainly , again and again .
Endless new levels , new shears , shelves and tables to descend .
Then all of a sudden , there was the bridge again .
This time , we could see its individual railings , and as we approached , through a tunnel hewn straight through the rock , the thick , deep air beside the rushing river was like a balm .
Whether it was the late afternoon light , the fatigue , the pain in my knee , or the relief of getting down , I found myself wallowing in a wonderful endorphin bath .
The world went glassy .
The canyon cliffs and trapezoids and pinnacles of rock all became resonant .
I watched myself walk , as if the real me were a deep witness to my life , rather than the one who apparently lives it .
Down here , with the enormous Colorado River beside us , encased in the immense walls of the inner gorge , we passed the old settlement of Anasazi Indians who lived here 1,000 years ago .
They planted corn and squash , and used nothing that did n't come from their immediate surroundings .
It occurred to me that today it takes a whole afternoon on vertiginous trails to accomplish the reverse : to enter an environment without human imports .
This is surely the kind of immersion a hiker seeks ; this is why it felt like a pilgrimage to come here .
It was good to reflect that if America has a heart , this just might be it .
By the time we reached Phantom Ranch , its own side canyon , Bright Angel Creek , was deep in chilly shade .
On reaching the quiet huddle of stone and timber cabins under their grove of silvery cottonwoods , the trees tattered with old dry leaves , with a bunk waiting , and hot showers in the bathhouse , and the creek plashing by – I was flooded with relief .
But even though we 'd descended to 700 m above sea level ( from over 2,000 m ) it was still freezing .
When the ranch bell rang for dinner , some two dozen guests trooped from their cabins through the frigid dusk to the main lodge , where we quietly feasted on stew , corn bread and salad .
We were from all over , all walks of life : a student from Quebec , a trucker from Kentucky , a fisherman from Alaska , a college student from New York , a woman in insurance , from Pennsylvania .
All these trappings of people 's lives seemed to fade in the context of this deep retreat from the world .
We were just people , making the pilgrimage from cradle to grave .
At 8 pm the dining room turns into a kind of mess hall .
People sit around playing cards , or Trivial Pursuit , drinking wine or beer , and the counter opens for the sale of odds and ends .
On a shelf sits the box for river mail , where letters wait for rafters coming downstream .
It was 2 am when a cry pierced the peace in our cabin : " I feel sick , Daddy . "
No sooner had I sprung from my bunk to fetch the rubbish bin than Saul was hunched over it , retching .
By 6 am he was hot with fever .
It had happened : stuck at the apex of a mile - high inverse mountain in winter , with a sick child .
At first light Bright Angel Creek was chalky , vague .
Then distant bluffs of red stone got picked out by the sun , and more and more bright geometries emerged .
While I was wondering what to do , rows of Easter Island - esque monoliths along the top of a cliff turned bright , and when the early sun struck the high outcrops , I could see how they got their Egyptian and Hindi names .
They did look like sphinxes and Oriental temples .
At 8 am I went to the lodge and asked if they had a thermometer .
They radioed down to the ranger station , and 10 minutes later Eston Littleboy Jones , a ranger equipped with a holstered automatic pistol and a Taser gun , was tending to my son .
Saul 's eyes lit up at the sight of the guns .
A quick check - up , and he was bouncing back .
By 11 am he was insisting we walk the Overlook Trail mentioned by Eston , one - and - a - half miles up to an outcrop overhanging the creek , then the River Loop Trail .
Apparently , it was a swift - moving stomach bug .
My legs were stiff as stilts .
It was as if , never having been near a Stairmaster , I had decided to spend all of yesterday on one .
But hiking seems to ease them .
From one of the two suspension bridges we stared down at the river .
" It looks like they 're fighting a war , " Saul said of the white waves .
" Fighting to get up the river . "
The frothing eddies did seem to be struggling with the current .
Two plumes of ripples curved into one central stream like trails of smoke sucked into a flue .
The canyon walls created a constantly changing concertina effect with volume .
There was a great bow of a pebble beach , except the pebbles were the size of cars .
It 's a landscape from The Lord of the Rings , with a perilous cliff path to match .
Any minute our way would be blocked by an orc .
The next day we made the climb back up the Bright Angel Trail .
Like the Kaibab Trail , this was also built for mules , having first been a Native American trail to the creek at Indian Gardens , half - way up .
Mule trails are good for hikers .
The beasts wo n't put up with anything too steep .
The trail makes its way up cliffs in endless switchbacks .
Rows of flying buttresses , a soaring ship 's prow throwing a huge flag of shadow across a cliff , a forbidding wall of masonry half a mile above us : the views never stopped coming .
Way above , on the whitish cliffs just under the rim , something was winking .
Could it be the windows of El Tovar , the old hotel where we 'll be spending the night ?
Along the climb at Devil 's Corkscrew , a chain of little waterfalls has carved out smooth dark basins in the rock .
Again and again it struck me how perfect the temperature is for hiking .
Through a grove of willow the stream flashed by , icy cold .
On that day we passed five hikers .
Once again , it was just us and the canyon .
And the circling condors overhead .
On the last two miles , stalactites of milky ice hung beside the trail .
Then solid grey snow was underfoot , like lacquer , impregnated with dust , slowing us right down .
As we stood still waiting to see if we could catch the sound of wind in the feathers of a condor gliding by , we heard from up above the deep gurgle of the first motorbike .
After three days away from carbon culture , the modern world seemed like Thunderdome now .
Finally , we slumped into El Tovar , the oldest Grand Canyon hotel , with its fireplaces of stone blocks and masses of dark timber , a perfect hiker 's rest .
The truth is , when I pulled into the Grand Canyon years before , I did n't even comprehend that it was a canyon .
It was such a vast landscape it seemed it might go on in pinnacles and gulfs for hundreds of miles .
But once you 've been down into it , you know what it is .
You understand .
At least a little .
And the mere thought of being disappointed by it ?
I 'm positively looking forward to Judgment Day .

Edit : Oct. 2 , 2010 - I 've written a new post that shows a bash one - liner command that will remove the old kernels from your system in one step .
You can check it out here .
If you 've been using Ubuntu Linux for a while , then you probably have a number of Linux kernel updates that have been installed on your system .
( I 've got a total of 3 kernels in my Karmic system already . )
In all likelihood , these updates get installed and you boot into the latest kernel , never to use the older kernels again .
But these old kernels are still hanging around on your system , cluttering up your grub boot screen and taking up space on your hard drive .
There have been attempts made to create an automatic tool to clean these up for you along with much discussion on the Ubuntu Forums , but so far there 's nothing officially in the repositories .
In the past , I 've gone into Synaptic and searched for the older kernels and related packages and manually marked them for removal .
This method works fine , but the search process is a little slow in Synaptic and you have to run a few searches to catch all of the packages to remove .
I decided to come up with a way to do this from the terminal and hopefully save some time .
The commands I 'm going to use can be a bit daunting , so just copy and paste .
Warning
Do n't follow this process unless you 're sure you do n't need to boot into the older kernels .
If you 're not sure , just leave things alone .
Also , it is possible to remove all of the kernels from your system and make it unbootable .
I suggest leaving the latest kernel and one version previous to that .
You can find out the kernel version that you 're currently running with
uname -r
Find and remove old kernels
The first step is to figure out what kernels are installed .
The following command will do the job .
ls / boot | grep vmlinuz | cut - d'-' - f2,3
Your result should look something like this .
2.6.28-15
2.6.28-16
2.6.28-17
This is the list of kernels installed on your system .
Now you want to find out which packages are installed relative to the kernel you want to remove .
For my example I 'm going to remove the oldest one , 2.6.28 - 15 .
dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep 2.6.28 - 15 | awk - F ' ' '{ print $ 2 }'
On my system , ( Jaunty ) the resulting list is :
linux - headers - 2.6.28-15
linux - headers - 2.6.28-15-generic
linux - image - 2.6.28-15-generic
linux - restricted - modules - 2.6.28-15-generic
Now that we know what packages to remove we can remove them with dpkg , apt - get or aptitude .
sudo aptitude remove linux - headers - 2.6.28 -15 linux - headers -2.6.28-15-generic linux- image -2.6.28-15-generic linux-restricted - modules-2.6.28-15-generic
That 's it .
You 've removed an old kernel and related packages .
Now you can keep your system as clean as it is right after you install Ubuntu .
The commands are a bit complex , so maybe I 'll write up a bash script when I have some time .
Proceed with caution !

“ We must cut our carbon emissions immediately ! “ …
“ We have to transition rapidly to 100 % renewable energy ! “ …
“ A massive nuclear build out is the only logical course of action ! “ … and so on .
We get these well - meant but hand - waving arguments all the time , almost always bereft of real - world numbers — especially those with $ $ attached .
This greatly limits their utility and credibility .
Without a practical , pragmatic plan , we are n’t going to get anywhere and the people in control of the purse strings will not pay them serious attention .
That ’s why I ’m so happy to present this new , clear - headed analysis by Peter Lang on BraveNewClimate ( which was spawned by in the discussion threads of previous posts on wind and solar power — their costs and ability to mitigate carbon emissions ) .
Using Australia as a case study ( although the same principles would apply in almost any developed economy that is currently reliant on fossil fuel energy ) , Peter considers six electricity supply scenarios for the period 2010 to 2050 — a high - carbon business - as - usual projection as a reference , and five low ( er ) carbon alternatives .
In each of the alternatives , coal - fired power stations are retired , and not replaced , such that by the period 2035 — 2040 , the last few are closed .
These analysis are simple , clearly presented and easily understood .
Yet they ’re also realistic in the same way that David Mackay ’s energy plans are realistic — they add up ( although Mackay was concerned about whether the physics are right , Lang is concerned about whether the $ $ and build rates are plausible ) .
They are an apples and apples set of plans , in the sense that they represent reasonable relative comparisons which all aim to achieve the same goal , in different ways .
Like any modelling exercise , the uncertainties lie in the quality of the input data and the acceptability of the assumptions made .
Peter makes them quite explicit .
If you wish to disagree and propose / source your own numbers , fine , but remember that the onus is then on you to justify your assumptions .
I ’ll stop and this point and let you read the analysis .
Get yourself a large mug of coffee or a tall glass of wine , and settle in for an interesting read .
After that , let the comments fly .
I certainly have my own points to make about where I think the analysis is most / least plausible , but that can come a little later …

His experience includes : coal , oil , gas , hydro , geothermal , nuclear power plants , nuclear waste disposal , and a wide range of energy end use management projects .
Abstract
Five options for cutting CO2 emissions from electricity generation in Australia are compared with a ‘ Business as Usual ’ option over the period 2010 to 2050 .
The six options comprise combinations of coal , gas , nuclear , wind and solar thermal technologies .
The conclusions :
The nuclear option reduces CO2 emissions the most , is the only option that can be built quickly enough to make the deep emissions cuts required , and is the least cost of the options that can cut emissions sustainably .
Solar thermal and wind power are the highest cost of the options considered .
The cost of avoiding emissions is lowest with nuclear and highest with solar and wind power .
Introduction
This paper presents a simple analysis of CO2 emissions , capital expenditure , electricity generation costs and the emissions avoidance cost for six options for supplying Australia ’s electricity .
The results are presented at five year intervals for the period 2010 to 2050 .
The purpose of this paper is to address two questions that were raised in discussion of three earlier papers ( Lang 2009a , Lang 2009 b , Lang 2009c ) .
The papers ‘ Solar Power Realities ’ ( Lang 2009 b ) , and the Addendum ( 2009 c ) , looked at the cost of reducing CO2 emissions using solar power .
They did this by looking at the limit situation ; that is , we replace all our fossil fuel electricity generation ‘ overnight ’ with either solar power and energy storage or with nuclear power .
The papers concluded that solar power would cost at least 40 times more than nuclear to supply the National Electricity Market ( NEM ) .
The estimates were based on current prices for currently available technologies and for the NEM demand in 2007 .
The first paper , “ Cost and Quantity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Avoided by Wind Generation ” ( Lang 2009a ) , concluded that wind power with back - up by gas generators saves little greenhouse gas emissions and the avoidance cost is high compared with other alternatives .
Discussion of these analyses raised two main questions :
1 . The limit situation does not take into account what happens during the transition period .
The earliest we could begin commissioning nuclear is about 2020 .
So , what should we do until then ?
Does it make sense to build wind power as fast as possible until 2020 , at least , so we can cut greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible and start as early as possible ?
2 . The previous papers consider replacement of fossil fuel generators with one technology only rather than with a mix of technologies .
This raises the question : would a mix of technologies be better able to meet the demand and at lower cost .
Would a mix of solar and wind be lower cost than either alone , and lower cost than nuclear ?
To attempt to answer these questions , in a ‘ ball park ’ way , I conducted a simple analysis of the cost , and CO2 emissions from six options ( six technology mixes ) for the period 2010 to 2050 .
The six options are :
1. Business as Usual ( BAU ) .
2. Combined Cycle Gas Turbine ( CCGT ) .
3. Nuclear and CCGT .
4. Wind and Gas [ Gas means a mix of Open Cycle Gas Turbine ( OCGT ) and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine ( CCGT ) ] .
5. Solar Thermal and CCGT
6. Solar Thermal , Wind and Gas .
Throughout the paper ‘ emissions ’ refers to ‘ CO2-e emissions ’ .
More specifically , it refers to CO2 - e emissions from electricity sent out from the power station .
The figures are not life cycle emissions ( see assumption 10 , below ) .
Assumptions
Assumptions that apply to all options are described in this section .
Assumptions that are specific to an option or to a technology are described under the relevant option in the Methodology section .
1 . The total energy supplied is as per the ABARE ( 2007 ) projections of electricity supply to 2030 , extended linearly to 2050 .
All options must supply this total energy for each period and all must provide the same quality of power as the Business as Usual case .
To achieve this , intermittent renewable energy generators must be backed up by a responsive generator technology .
2 . For all except the Business as Usual case , it is assumed that coal fired power stations can be and will be decommissioned at the rate of 1 GW per year for black coal generators and 0.4 GW per year for brown coal generators .
3 . The energy deficit caused by decommissioning the coal fired power stations is supplied by replacement generating capacity .
Five options for replacement generating capacity are considered .
Each option comprises a mix of a few technologies that in combination are capable , theoretically , of providing the energy and the power that would have been provided by the coal power stations .
That is , the mixes of replacement technologies must be capable of providing the same power quality , and of supplying it on demand , at all times .
4. The ABARE ( 2007 ) projections provide the breakdown of energy supply by nine generation types ; four fossil fuel and five renewable energy .
The energy supplied by the seven non-coal technologies is the same in all six options [ There is one exception to this statement – see Option 3 – Nuclear and CCGT ] .
The Business as Usual case is as per the ABARE ( 2007 ) projections for all nine technologies .
5 . The main constraint in the analyses is the assumed decommissioning rate for coal fired power stations and the assumed build rate achievable for the replacement technologies .
The build rate assumptions are arguably optimistic .
The achievability of the assumed build rates is discussed in a later section .
6 . The capital expenditures do not include the cost of replacement of the reserve capacity margin that is needed to cover for scheduled and unscheduled outages because the reserve capacity margin is assumed to be the same for all options .
7 . The analyses are intentionally simple so that non-specialists can follow the assumptions and analyses .
A more thorough analysis would use sophisticated modelling to optimise the mix of technologies and to calculate the long run marginal cost of electricity sent out .
All available technologies would be included in the analyses rather then the simple mixes used in these analyses .
Such analyses are complicated and need sophisticated modelling capability .
For examples see EPRI ( 2009a ) , MIT ( 2007 ) , MIT ( 2009 ) , ACIL - Tasman ( 2009 ) , Frontier Economics ( 2009 ) , ATSE ( 2008 ) .
8. Transmission costs are similar for the Business as Usual , CCGT and Nuclear options .
So no additional cost is included for transmission for the CCGT and Nuclear options .
Extra costs for transmission are included for the Wind and Solar Thermal options .
9 . No allowance is made for the lower energy growth rate that energy efficiency improvements will bring .
This omission is offset because no allowance is made for the higher growth rate as cleaner electricity replaces gas for heating and replaces oil for land transport ( either in electric vehicles or through synthetic fuels such as methanol or hydrogen that use electricity for their production ) .
10 . CO2 emissions from nuclear and the renewable energy technologies are assumed to be zero in operation , consistent with DCC ( 2009 ) , EPRI ( 2009 b ) and Frontier ( 2009 ) .
On a Life Cycle Analysis ( LCA ) basis the emissions from these technologies are small compared with fossil fuel generation .
These are ignored in this simple analysis .
[ Lightbucket ( 2009 ) lists the results from authoritative studies of LCA emissions from electricity generation ] .
11 . No attempt has been made to reconcile CO2 emissions calculated for the Business as Usual option with the emissions projections published by the Department of Climate Change ( 2009 ) .
12 . The ABARE ( 2007 ) energy projections are for all Australia ’s electricity supply , both off - grid and on - grid .
However , the analyses here apply the ABARE ( 2007 ) figures as if they were for grid connected electricity .
This simplification means the potential for emissions reductions and the cost of the options is overstated ( perhaps by 10 % in early years decreasing over time ) .
Table 1 lists the CO2-e emissions intensities for sent out electricity in 2010 for the Business as Usual technologies .
Table 2 summarises the assumptions and inputs for the coal and replacement technologies .
Methodology
This section explains how the analyses were done .
Option 1 – Business as Usual ( BAU )
The ABARE ( 2007 ) projections for electricity supply for the years 2005 - 06 to 2029 - 30 were extended to 2050 and converted from petajoules ( PJ ) to terawatt - hours ( TWh ) .
Figure 1 shows the energy projections for the Business as Usual option .
The CO2 emissions were calculated for the Business as Usual case by multiplying the energy by the CO2 emissions factors .
The assumed emissions factors for 2010 are listed in Table 1 .
Emissions factors for the periods after 2010 were reduced at the rate of 1 % per 5 years to account for average efficiency improvements for the existing generators and new generators .
The renewable and nuclear technologies are assumed to produce zero emissions ( Table 1 ) .
To compare the cost difference between the options we need only compare the cost of the coal with the replacement technologies .
All the other technologies are the same for all options .
The capital expenditure for coal in the Business as Usual case comprises two components :
a ) the capital expenditure of new coal capacity added to meet the rising demand for electricity ; and
b ) the capital expenditure of new coal to replace old coal that has reached the end of its economic life .
To work with capital expenditure , we must convert the energy figures in the ABARE projections to average power .
The energy ( TWh ) was converted to average power ( GW ) using a capacity factor of 90 % ( refer Table 2 ) .
As mentioned previously , this simple analysis ignores the reserve capacity margin needed in the generation system .
The amount of new coal capacity required each year for the Business as Usual case was calculated from the ABARE ( 2007 ) projections .
The amount of new coal to replace existing coal at the end of its economic life was calculated as 2 % of existing capacity per year [ Assuming a 40 year economic life , the plants would be replaced at the rate of 2.5 % per year if the capacity was constant from year to year .
However , the capacity is increasing over time .
In any one year we need to replace only the plants that are 40 years old .
If the capacity doubles in 40 years , then we need to replace 1.25 % of the total existing capacity in each year .
I have assumed 2 % as a round figure in between 1.25 % and 2.5 % . ] .
The capital cost of new coal capacity for the Business as Usual option was calculated by multiplying the amount of new coal capacity by the unit rate for Ultra Super Critical Black Coal ( air cooled ) and Ultra Super Critical Brown Coal ( air cooled ) ( refer Table 35 , ACIL - Tasman 2009 ) .
All non-BAU options
For all options other than Business as Usual , black coal capacity is decommissioned at the rate of 1 GW per year , and brown coal at the rate of 0.4 GW per year .
Decommissioning starts in 2010 .
All black coal is decommissioned by 2040 and all brown coal by 2035 .
The amount of energy these power stations would have generated if not decommissioned is calculated .
This is the energy deficit that must be supplied by the replacement generators in all the non Business as Usual options .
The CO2 emissions from the remaining coal capacity are calculated by multiplying the energy generated from black coal and brown coal by the emissions factor for that technology for that year .
The Business as Usual Option comprises projections for nine technologies , – Black Coal , Brown Coal and seven others .
The emissions from all the seven non-coal technologies are the same for all options .
The following sections describe the five options considered here for replacing the energy from the decommissioned coal power stations .
Option 2 – Combined Cycle Gas Turbine ( CCGT )
CCGT is built to replace the energy deficit resulting from the decommissioning of the coal fired plants .
The amount of CCGT capacity required is calculated by multiplying the energy deficit by 90 % capacity factor .
Figure 2 shows the energy supplied by each technology .
The CO2 emissions for CCGT are calculated using a CO2 emissions factor of 0.45 t CO2 / MWh , decreasing at 1 % per five year to reflect increasing generation efficiency .
The CO2 emissions from the remaining coal generators and from the other seven technologies are included in the total for this option .
The capital cost for this option is calculated using the unit rate for new build CCGT ( air cooled ) given in Table 35 , ACIL Tasman ( 2009 ) , and decreasing at - 0.4 % pa from 2030 to 2050 .
Option 3 – Nuclear and CCGT
For this option , nuclear power is commissioned at the rate of 1 GW per year from 2020 to 2025 , then at 1.5 GW per year to 2030 , then at 2 GW per year to 2050 .
The reason for selecting these rates is discussed below in “ How achievable are the build rates ”
CCGT is commissioned at the rate needed to make up the difference between the energy that the nuclear power can supply and the energy deficit caused by decommissioning the coal power stations .
Figure 3 shows how much energy is produced by each technology .
From 2010 to 2019 , no nuclear capacity is commissioned so the CCGT capacity is the same as in Option 2 – CCGT .
From 2020 to 2025 , nuclear is not built fast enough to replace the coal capacity being decommissioned , so CCGT is added to supply the energy deficit .
After 2025 , nuclear is being built faster than coal is being decommissioned .
So , progressively less energy is being required from CCGT .
This shows up ( in this simple analysis ) as a reduction in CCGT capacity .
The practical interpretation of this is that the Natural Gas generation capacity would be reduced at this rate .
This means that Natural Gas generation capacity would not be replaced at the end of its 30 year economic life .
This begins from about 2025 .
CO2 emissions for nuclear are assumed to be zero ( see ‘ Assumptions ’ and Table 1 ) .
CO2 emissions for Coal , CCGT and the other technologies are calculated in the same way as for Option 2 – CCGT .
As for capacity , the negative emissions shown against CCGT should actually be a reduction in emissions from ‘ Natural Gas ’ but for simplicity of calculation they are shown as negative for CCGT .
The capital cost calculations for this option are similar to those for Option 2 – CCGT .
The cost of the nuclear capacity is at the unit rate in ACIL - Tasman ( 2009 ) , Table 35 , and decreasing at - 0.9 % pa from 2030 to 2035 then at - 0.6 % pa to 2050 .
Option 4 – Wind and Gas
For this option , wind power capacity is commissioned at the same rate as the coal fired plants are decommissioned .
So when all wind farms are producing full power ( a rare event ) , the wind farms will supply all the energy that the decommissioned coal fired power plants would have supplied .
When the wind farms are not producing full power , back - up generation is required to make up for the energy deficit .
Back - up capacity is provided by a combination of Combined Cycle Gas Turbines ( CCGT ) and Open Cycle Gas Turbines ( OCGT ) .
Equal proportions are assumed .
A Capacity Credit of 8 % is assumed ( AER , 2009 ) , so 1 GW of wind power capacity is assumed to be backed up by 0.46 GW of OCGT and 0.46 GW of CCGT [ In practice more gas capacity will be built than this calculation indicates .
OCGT and CCGT run at lower capacity factors in practice than the 90 % used in this analysis for calculating the amount of capacity required ] .
The proportions , on the basis of capacity , are 1.0:0.46:0.46 .
The energy is calculated assuming a capacity factor of 30 % for Wind and availability of 90 % for OCGT and CCGT .
So , on average , 3 GWh of energy is supplied by a combination of Wind , OCGT and CCGT in the proportions 1:1:1 .
Figure 4 shows how much energy is produced by each technology .
CO2 emissions for wind generation are assumed to be zero ( refer to ‘ Assumptions ’ and Table 1 ) .
The CO2 emissions for OCGT are calculated using a CO2 emissions intensity of 0.7 t CO2 / MWh , decreasing at 1 % per five years to reflect increasing generation efficiency .
CO2 emissions for CCGT , Coal and the other technologies are calculated in the same way as for Option 2 – CCGT .
The lower efficiency and higher emissions from the gas turbines when operating in back up mode ( Lang , 2009a ; Hawkins , 2009 ) are included in this analysis .
The CO2 emissions are increased by 34 % for OCGT and 17 % for CCGT ( Hawkins , 2009 ) when these technologies are operating in back - up mode .
The higher emissions rate is applied to the proportion of the energy that is generated when they are assumed to be operating in ‘ back - up ’ mode .
For simplicity this is assumed to be equal to the proportion of the replacement energy that is generated by Wind .
In effect , the increased emissions factor is applied to half the energy generated by the CCGT and OCGT replacement generators .
The capital cost calculations for this option are similar to those for Option 2 – CCGT and Option 3 – Nuclear and CCGT .
The capital cost of the wind capacity is $ 2591 / kW ( Average of seven wind farms listed as ‘ under construction ’ in ABARE ( 2009 ) .
This Australian cost is close to the US cost in EPRI ( 2009 b ) , Table 7.1 , p 7 - 5 , which is US$ 2350 / kW = A$ 2611 / kW ) in 2010 and decreasing in future periods at - 0.6 % pa ( Frontier , 2009 ) .
The cost of OCGT and CCGT capacity is at the unit rate in ACIL - Tasman ( 2009 ) , Table 35 , increasing at +0.4 % pa and +0.5 % pa from 2030 to 2050 .
As mentioned above , the OCGT and CCGT generators are less efficient when operating in back up mode for wind .
These analyses assume that the electricity generation costs are 17 % higher for CCGT and 34 % higher for OCGT ( Hawkins , 2009 ) .
However , only half the energy generated by these technologies is considered to be in back - up mode , so electricity cost is increased by 8.5 % for CCGT and 17 % for OCGT when operating in back - up mode .
Wind power is assumed to have an economic life of 25 years and gas 30 years .
Wind and gas capacity installed in 2010 must be replaced in 2035 and 2040 respectively .
The capital costs of replacing wind and gas at the end of their economic lives are calculated at the capital cost rate applicable for the year in which the replacement is commissioned .
Wind power requires significant additional capital expenditure for transmission and network management capability .
Based on estimated costs for extra transmission capacity incurred because of wind generation in the USA , $ 1,000 / kW of installed wind capacity is included ( Gene Preston , pers . comm. , 3 Nov 2009 ) .
The transmission cost for wind power raises the cost of electricity by an assumed $ 15 / MWh on average ( Gene Preston , Dec 2009 , pers .
comm. and EPRI , 2009a ) .
Option 5 – Solar Thermal and CCGT
This option is similar to Option 3 – Nuclear & CCGT but with solar thermal instead of nuclear .
The differences are :
1 . The build rate of solar thermal capacity in this option ( Option 5 ) is half the build rate of nuclear in Option 3 – Nuclear & CCGT
2 . Therefore , the build rate of CCGT is higher in this option than in the Nuclear & CCGT option ( to make up the energy difference ) .
This means emissions are higher in the Solar & CCGT option than in the Nuclear & CCGT option .
3 . Solar thermal capacity has an assumed life expectancy of 25 years so replacement of solar thermal capacity begins 25 years after the first installation ; so replacement begins in 2045 .
4 . Whereas nuclear would be built near population centres , where work force , infrastructure , suppliers and services are available , this is not the case for solar thermal [ The NEEDS ( 2009 ) costs are based on constructing the Andasol 1 solar thermal power station in Spain .
The cost of constructing widely distributed solar thermal power stations over an area of some 3000 km by 1000 km in Australia ’s deserts will be higher than the cost of constructing in Spain – where there is well developed infrastructure and larger work force nearer to the sites .
To construct the solar thermal power stations in areas throughout central Australia will require large mobile construction camps , fly - in fly - out work force , large concrete batch plants , large supply of water , energy and good roads to each power station .
Air fields suitable for fly - in fly - out will be required at say one per 250 MW power station .
That means we need to build such air fields at the rate of about two , then three , then four per year .
] .
Solar thermal needs to be built in areas of high insolation ( deserts ) and the power stations must be widely distributed to minimise the impacts of widespread cloud cover .
5. Transmission costs are included at the rate of $ 1,200 / kW ( derived from estimates in AEMO , 2009 ) .
Solar thermal capacity is commissioned at the rate of 0.5 GW per year from 2020 to 2025 , then at 0.75 GW per year to 2030 , then at 1 GW per year to 2050 .
However , from 2040 , some of the new build is for replacing existing old capacity .
Solar thermal capacity is assumed to have the same capacity factor as nuclear , i.e. 90 % .
This is based on NEEDS ( 2008 ) which forecasts that solar thermal will have this capability by 2020 [ There is an alternative to solar thermal with sufficient energy storage for 90 % capacity factor .
The alternative is solar thermal hybrid .
Gas generates power when the sun is n’t shining and there is insufficient energy storage .
The hybrid options emits much more CO2 than CST alone and the electricity costs are higher ( EPRI , 2009a , page 10 - 20 ) , although this comparison is made at a capacity factor of 34 % not 90 % .
NEEDS argues that the solar thermal with 8000 full load hours energy storage will be available and electricity costs will be less than the hybrid option by 2020 .
The hybrid option is not included in the options considered here ] .
CCGT is commissioned at the rate needed to make up the difference between the energy that the solar thermal capacity can provide and the energy deficit caused by decommissioning the coal fired power stations .
From 2010 to 2019 , negligible solar thermal is commissioned so CCGT is built at the same rate as in Option 2 – CCGT and Option 3 – Nuclear & CCGT .
From 2020 to 2040 CCGT is being added because solar thermal is not being built fast enough to replace the coal capacity being decommissioned .
By 2040 all coal capacity has been decommissioned .
So , from 2040 less energy is being required from CCGT .
This shows up , in this simple analysis , as reduction in CCGT capacity .
The practical interpretation of the reduction of CCGT capacity is that the Natural Gas generation capacity would be reduced at this rate .
What this means is that the Natural Gas generation would not be replaced at the end of its 30 year economic life .
This begins from about 2040 .
Figure 5 shows how much energy is produced by each technology .
CO2 emissions for solar thermal are assumed to be zero ( refer Table 1 ) .
CO2 emissions for coal , CCGT and the other technologies are calculated in the same way as for Option 3 – Nuclear and CCGT .
The negative emissions shown against CCGT should actually be a reduction in emissions from ‘ Natural Gas ’ but for simplicity they are shown as negative against CCGT .
The capital cost calculations for this option are similar to those for Option 3 – Nuclear and CCGT , except that the capital cost of transmission is added and the capital cost of replacing retiring solar thermal capacity is included from 2045 .
The capital cost of the solar thermal capacity is based on adjusted unit rates from NEEDS ( 2008 ) , Figure 3.11 , Case B [ The ‘ learning rates ’ , and hence the costs , in the NEEDS report seem optimistic ( see Appendix 2 ) ] .
The rates are adjusted to attempt to make them more consistent with the way the ACIL - Tasman ( 2009 ) rates were derived .
Two adjustments were made .
Firstly , the initial capital cost unit rate is adjusted up by 25 % to allow for the greater cost of constructing widely distributed power stations across an area roughly 1000 km by 3000 km of Australia ’s deserts .
Secondly , the learning rate in NEEDS ( 2008 ) is replaced with the same rate of cost reduction as for nuclear in Option 3 - Nuclear and CCGT .
The capacity factor assumed for solar thermal is the same as for nuclear , coal and gas .
This requires that the solar thermal power stations have sufficient energy storage for 24 hour operation and can provide for 8,000 full - load hours per year .
Needs ( 2008 ) forecast that this capability could be available by 2020 .
The additional capacity needed to ensure full power generation throughout winter and throughout periods of overcast weather ( Lang , 2009 b ) , is not allowed for in this analysis .
As for wind , transmission is a significant cost item for solar thermal .
The capital expenditure for transmission for solar thermal is calculated at $ 1200 / kW ( based on estimates in AEMO , 2009 ) .
Electricity cost includes $ 15 / MWh for transmission .
Option 6 – Solar Thermal , Wind and Gas
For this option , it is assumed that solar thermal is commissioned at the same rate as in Option 5 – Solar Thermal & CCGT .
Wind , CCGT and OCGT are commissioned at the same rate as in Option 4 – Wind & Gas .
The solar capacity does not reduce the amount of gas capacity needed to back - up for the wind capacity .
Gas capacity required to back up for wind does not change but the amount of energy the gas generates does change , with the gas generators working at lower capacity factors .
The energy generated by solar thermal is the same as in Option 5 – Solar Thermal and CCGT .
The energy generated by wind is the same as in Option 4 – Wind & Gas .
The energy generated by OCGT and CCGT makes up the energy deficit .
Figure 6 shows how much energy is produced by each technology .
CO2 emissions for wind and solar are assumed to be zero in this analysis ( see Table 1 ) .
CO2 emissions for OCGT , CCGT , coal and the other seven technologies are calculated in the same way as for Option 4 – Wind and Gas .
The capital cost calculations for this option are similar to those for Option 4 – Wind & Gas and Option 5 – Solar Thermal & CCGT .
The capital cost of the solar capacity in this option is the same as for Option 5 – Solar Thermal & CCGT .
The capital cost of the wind capacity is the same as for Option 4 – Wind & Gas .
The capital cost of the gas capacity is less than Option 4 – Wind & Gas because of the contribution from solar thermal ; solar thermal provides its share of energy and the gas makes up the deficit .
Transmission cost is included at $ 15 / MWh for solar thermal and for wind .
Build rates
The rate of decommissioning coal and commissioning the replacement generating capacity , for each option , is summarised in Table 3 .
The figures in the shaded cells are prescribed inputs and the unshaded cells are calculated values .
Electricity Costs
The cost of electricity , for coal and the replacement technologies , was calculated for each option .
The electricity costs were calculated by applying the electricity cost unit rate ( see Table 4 and Appendix 2 ) to the proportion of energy generated by each technology .
Appendix 2 explains the sources and derivation of the electricity cost unit rates for use in this analysis .
CO2 Avoidance Cost
The CO2 avoidance cost ( the cost to avoid a tonne of CO2 emissions ) was calculated for each option .
It is the difference in electricity cost between Business as Usual and the respective option divided by the difference in CO2 emission between the Business as Usual and the respective option .
Results
The results of the analyses are summarised in Figures 7 to 12 .
Figure 7 compares the total CO2 emissions per year from the six options .
Figure 8 compares the capital expenditure per 5 years for the six options .
The capital expenditure is for coal and the replacement technologies only .
The capital expenditure for the other seven technologies is the same for all options ; these costs are not included in the total capital expenditure figures shown here .
Figure 9 compares the cumulative capital expenditure of the six options .
Figure 10 shows the long run marginal cost of electricity for coal and the replacement technologies only .
These costs do not include the cost for the seven technologies that are the same in all options .
Figure 11 compares the options on the basis of the CO2 avoidance cost ; i.e. the cost to avoid a tonne of CO2 .
Discussion
The following can be interpreted from Figures 7 and 8 :
Option 1 – Business as Usual produces the highest CO2 emissions by a large margin .
Capital expenditure is fairly consistent at about $ 10 to $ 15 billion per 5 years , or about $ 2 to $ 3 billion per year .
Option 2 – CCGT has the highest emissions of the replacement options .
It has the lowest capital cost of all options ( although it has the highest operating cost ) .
The CO2 emissions with this option are only slightly less in 2050 than in 2010 .
The reason the curve turns up from 2040 is that all coal fired power stations have been decommissioned .
Therefore , CCGT is being added but no coal is being removed .
So we are adding emissions from the CCGT without cutting any from coal generation .
Option 3 – Nuclear and CCGT has the lowest CO2 emissions from 2020 .
It has the lowest capital expenditure , except Business as Usual and CCGT , for most of the period from 2010 to 2050 .
From 2035 the capital expenditure rate decreases .
Option 4 – Wind , with CCGT and OCGT for back - up , produces slightly lower CO2 emissions than the CCGT .
However , this is achieved at high cost – about $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion per year more than CCGT .
The step up in expenditure in 2040 is for replacement of the wind capacity installed in 2015 .
The emissions increase from 2040 as electricity demand increases and once the coal generators have been decommissioned .
Option 5 – Solar Thermal and CCGT .
Solar thermal capacity is built at half the rate of nuclear , and provides half the energy .
CCGT must be built faster in the solar option than in the nuclear option to make up the energy deficit .
The CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2019 are the same for the three options CCGT , Nuclear & CCGT and Wind & CCGT .
From 2020 , the CO2 emissions from the solar thermal option are higher than from the nuclear option .
By 2050 , the CO2 emissions from the solar thermal option are over three times those from the nuclear option , and increasing as electricity demand increases .
The capital expenditure for the solar option is substantially higher than for nuclear throughout .
Option 6 – Solar , Wind and Gas is a combination of Options 4 and 5 .
CO2 emissions are the second lowest from 2020 to 2050 .
Importantly , this option requires around $ 5 billion to $ 6 billion per year higher capital expenditure than nuclear to 2030 .
From 2030 to 2050 the difference in capital expenditure blows out to over $ 10 billion per year higher rate of expenditure for this option .
Figure 9 shows the cumulative capital cost and Figure 10 shows the long run marginal cost of electricity ( LRMC ) .
The following can be interpreted from these two charts :
CCGT is the lowest cost option throughout the period from 2010 to 2050 .
Nuclear & CCGT has the lowest total cost ( cumulative capital expenditure ) of all options except Business as Usual and CCGT .
The electricity cost for the Nuclear & CCGT option peaks in 2045 then starts to decrease as Natural Gas is decommissioned .
The steep rise in capital expenditure and electricity cost for the Wind option and the Solar Thermal and Wind option is because of the high cost of Wind and because Wind is being added at the rate of 1.4 GW per year from 2011 , which is three times the rate Wind was commissioned in 2008 .
The options with wind and solar thermal produce the highest cost electricity throughout .
The cumulative capital expenditure for the Solar Thermal option is about 30 % higher than for nuclear .
This is despite the fact that the solar thermal capacity is being built at half the rate of nuclear .
Important to note :
The electricity cost for the Solar Thermal , Wind and Gas option is higher than the Solar Thermal and CCGT option .
This indicates that combining renewable energy generators does not reduce the cost .
Figure 11 compares the options on the basis of the cost of avoiding a tonne of CO2 emissions .
The CCGT option has the lowest avoidance cost to 2035 and then the Nuclear & CCGT option is lowest thereafter .
The difference , in 2015 , between the options that have Wind in their mix ( $ 163/ tCO2 -e ) and those that do not ( 50/ tCO2 -e ) is because wind with gas back up is far more expensive but avoids insignificant extra emissions ( see Figure 7 ) .
In the long run , Nuclear & CCGT is the least cost way to reduce emissions from electricity generation .
The options with Wind and Solar are the highest cost way to avoid emissions .
How achievable are the assumed build rates ?
The build rate for Business as Usual has been achieved consistently to date , so there can be no doubt that it is achievable .
The build rate for CCGT is about twice the build rate for coal in the Business as Usual case and about 15 times the current build rate for Natural Gas generation plant .
The build rate for wind capacity ( 1.4 GW per year ) is about 3 times the build rate achieved in 2008 ( 0.48 GW ) ( GWEC , 2008 ) .
For comparison , in 2008 USA installed 8.4 GW and China 6.3 GW ( GWEC , 2009 ) .
Interestingly , developed countries with larger economies than Australia , installed not much more than Australia , e.g. Canada ( 0.5 GW ) .
AER ( 2009 ) , Table 1.4 shows a peak for proposed commissioning of 2.8 GW in 2011 .
In practice , the build rate for wind will be limited by transmission capacity and the amount of wind power that can be accepted by the grid .
The assumed build rate of 1.4 GW per year ( 500 - 700 turbines a year based on current turbine sizes ) seems achievable in the future .
The rate of commissioning nuclear from 2020 to 2025 is 1 GW per year .
That is equivalent to one new reactor per mainland state every 5 years .
To put this in perspective , France commissioned its Gen II nuclear power plants at the rate of 3 GW per year for two decades ( WNA , 2009 ) .
And Japan , China and Korea have been building the new Gen III nuclear power plants in about 4 years .
So , it would seem the build rate for nuclear assumed here could be achieved from 2020 , if necessary .
The assumed rate of commissioning solar thermal in these analyses , seems highly optimistic .
The quantity of steel and concrete required is an indication of the amount of construction effort required .
Solar thermal requires about 8 times more concrete and 15 times more steel than nuclear per MW of capacity ( Table 5 ) .
The build rate for solar thermal , assumed in these analyses , is half the rate of nuclear , so each year we would need to construct solar thermal plants comprising 4 times more concrete and seven times more steel than the nuclear plants .
But that ’s not all .
Nuclear would be built relatively close to the population centres , where services , infrastructure and work force is more readily available .
Conversely , the solar plants need to be built in the desert regions .
They will require four times as much water ( for concrete ) as nuclear .
Water pipe lines will need to be built across the desert to supply the water .
Dams will need to be built in the tropical north to store water and desalination plants along the coast elsewhere .
To develop and retain a skilled work force to work in such regions will be costly .
Work will be for about 9 months of the year to avoid the hottest periods .
Based on the quantities of steel and concrete , towns will be required in the desert that accommodate about four times the work force required for constructing a nuclear power station .
Fly - in - fly - out airports will need to be built for each town with a capability to move much larger numbers of people than the largest mining operations .
Two such towns and airfields must be built per year to achieve the solar thermal build rate .
It is hard to imagine how a build rate for solar thermal could be even 1/10th the build rate that could be achieved with nuclear .
The build rate for nuclear would be difficult to achieve .
But the build rates for solar thermal would be much more difficult to achieve .
Sensitivity to assumptions and inputs
The results are highly sensitive to some of the assumptions and inputs .
The most sensitive inputs are the projections of future capital cost , electricity cost , and the development rates for solar thermal .
However , the ranking of the options under different inputs , and therefore the conclusions are robust over the ranges tested .
Answers to the questions
This paper set out to address the two questions stated in the Introduction , viz . :
1 . Does it make sense to build wind power as fast as possible until 2020 , at least , so we can cut greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible and start cutting as early as possible ?
2 . Would a mix of technologies be better able to meet the demand and do so at lower cost ?
For example , would a mix of solar and wind be lower cost than either alone , and lower cost than nuclear ?
Figure 11 provides the answers .
The answer to Question 1 is ‘ No ’ .
Figure 11 shows the emissions avoidance cost for the options without wind is $ 50/ tCO2-e and for the options with wind is $ 163 / tCO2-e in 2015 .
In 2020 , the ranking is the same but the costs are higher ( see Figure 11 ) .
The answer to Question 2 is ‘ No ’ .
The option with the mix of Solar Thermal and Wind has the highest avoidance cost of all options .
It has the highest capital expenditure by far ( Figures 8 and 9 ) , and the highest electricity cost ( figure 10 ) .
Its CO2 emissions are greater than the nuclear option .
It has no advantages .
Figure 12 summarises the position in 2050 .
The figure compares the six options on the basis of the electricity cost of the coal and replacement technologies and the total CO2 emissions per year for each option .
Clearly , the Nuclear and CCGT option produces the lowest emissions and the cost penalty is marginally higher than CCGT .
Conclusions
The Nuclear power option will enable the largest cut in CO2-e emissions from electricity generation .
The Nuclear option is the only option that can be built quickly enough to make the deep cuts required by 2050 .
The Nuclear option is the least cost of the options that can cut emissions sustainably .
Wind and solar are the highest cost ways to cut emissions .
A mixture of solar thermal and wind power is the highest cost and has the highest avoidance cost of the options considered .
Mixing these technologies does not reduce the cost , it increases the cost .
The results are sensitive to the input assumptions and input data , but the ranking of the options , and therefore the conclusions , are robust to the changes of inputs tested .

Yesterday we covered domestic reaction to Hillary Clinton 's speech on Internet freedom , not - so - subtly aimed at China .
But , as you might expect , the perspective from across the Pacific is a bit different -- particularly in China 's Communist Party - owned newspaper , China Daily .
Though Clinton came down hard on censorship and cyber-attacks -- unsurprising given recent public support for Google in its censorship - hacking spat with the Chinese government -- the state - run China Daily publishes a rebuttal today .
The Internet , argues the editorial , is an American invention , is in American control , and has been used by the United States for intelligence and military purposes .
The theme appears to be one similar to that articulated by Yu Wanli of Peking University , quoted by Liu Dong in another Chinese daily , the Global Times : " Clinton 's so - called Internet freedom is a freedom that is dominated by the US ... the US can define the freedom of the Internet .
How can Clinton guarantee you a freedom if her country has the power to unplug you ? "
Or , as the China Daily headline states , " Internet - - new shot in the arm for US hegemony . "
That 's not to say all Chinese responses to Clinton are refutations .

The remarkable feat of tying light in knots has been achieved by a team of physicists working at the universities of Bristol , Glasgow and Southampton , UK , reports a paper in Nature Physics this week
The remarkable feat of tying light in knots has been achieved by a team of physicists working at the universities of Bristol , Glasgow and Southampton , UK , reports a paper in Nature Physics this week .
Understanding how to control light in this way has important implications for laser technology used in wide a range of industries .
Dr Mark Dennis from the University of Bristol and lead author on the paper , explained : " In a light beam , the flow of light through space is similar to water flowing in a river .
Although it often flows in a straight line - out of a torch , laser pointer , etc - light can also flow in whirls and eddies , forming lines in space called ' optical vortices ' .
" Along these lines , or optical vortices , the intensity of the light is zero ( black ) .
The light all around us is filled with these dark lines , even though we can't see them " .
Optical vortices can be created with holograms which direct the flow of light .
In this work , the team designed holograms using knot theory - a branch of abstract mathematics inspired by knots that occur in shoelaces and rope .
Using these specially designed holograms they were able to create knots in optical vortices .
This new research demonstrates a physical application for a branch of mathematics previously considered completely abstract .
Professor Miles Padgett from Glasgow University , who led the experiments , said : " The sophisticated hologram design required for the experimental demonstration of the knotted light shows advanced optical control , which undoubtedly can be used in future laser devices " .
" The study of knotted vortices was initiated by Lord Kelvin back in 1867 in his quest for an explanation of atoms " , adds Dennis , who began to study knotted optical vortices with Professor Sir Michael Berry at Bristol University in 2000 .
" This work opens a new chapter in that history . "

US chemists have shown that a hugely porous chemical cage containing large numbers of exposed magnesium centres can efficiently and selectively capture carbon dioxide from a mixture of gases and subsequently release it using little energy .
The material , a metal organic framework or MOF , captures and releases CO 2 more efficiently than any other system tested so far and , the researchers say , should be seriously considered as a potential candidate for the energy - efficient trapping of CO 2 as part of carbon capture and storage strategies to decrease the volume of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere .
Omar Yaghi and his team at the University of California in Los Angeles tested the CO 2 - filtering capacity of a compound called Mg - MOF - 74 , in which magnesium centres are joined by organic linkers to create a highly porous network .
The team then directed a stream of gas consisting of 20 per cent CO 2 and 80 per cent methane through the MOF .
The material retained no methane and captured only the CO 2 , trapping an equivalent of 89g of the gas per kilogram of material before it became saturated , a figure more than twice the amount of any other MOF tested and more than zeolites , another class of material being investigated as a candidate for CO 2 capture .
It seems that the magnesium interacts weakly but selectively with the CO 2 , Yaghi says .
Significantly , the MOF spontaneously released nearly 90 per cent of the trapped CO 2 at room temperature once the pressure of the gas flow was released , and surrendered the remaining trapped gas after heating to 80?C .
’ Most people have been looking at trapping CO 2 in porous materials in terms of equilibrium uptake , ’ Yaghi says .
’ In other words the material is exposed to CO 2 until equilibrium is reached , which could take minutes to hours [ or longer ] .
In our case we have what we call kinetic separation .
You expose the material to an incoming wave of a mixture of gases and immediately you look at what is being held and what is being expelled .
You do not have to wait until equilibrium is established . ’
Ashleigh Fletcher , who researches carbon capture technologies at the University of Strathclyde in the UK , is encouraged by the findings , saying the results ’ represent a big development in physical adsorbents for carbon capture and storage applications , with increased initial and regeneration capacities over zeolitic counterparts . ’
However , Fletcher cautions that despite promising results in the lab , real - life applications of the discovery will need more development : ’ As is often the case with such materials , there may be issues with scale of production for commercial purposes , and greater investigation into the role of competing species , for example water vapour , in the process stream would yield more practicable data for industrial applications . ’

Mr Yamaguchi had the bad luck to be in Hiroshima and then Nagasaki
The only person officially recognised as having survived both atomic bombings in Japan at the end of World War II has died from stomach cancer , aged 93 .
Tsutomu Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima on a business trip on 6 August 1945 when a US plane dropped the first atomic bomb .
He suffered serious burns and spent a night there before returning to his home city of Nagasaki just before it was bombed on 9 August .
He said he hoped his experience held a lesson of peace for future generations .
It was already recorded that Mr Yamaguchi had survived the Nagasaki bomb , but in March last year officials recognised he had been in Hiroshima as well .
' Precious storyteller '
A handful or Japanese people are known to have lived through both attacks , but Mr Yamaguchi is the only one formally recognised by the Japanese government to have done so .
More than 200,000 people were killed in the two atomic bombings Certification as a hibakusha or radiation survivor qualifies Japanese citizens for government compensation , including medical check - ups , and funeral costs .
On learning of his official recognition last year , Mr Yamaguchi said : " My double radiation exposure is now an official government record .
" It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die . "
In his later years , Mr Yamaguchi gave talks about his experiences as an atomic bomb survivor and emphasised his hope nuclear weapons would be abolished .
About 140,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki .
Survivors fell sick with radiation - related illnesses , including cancers , for years after the bombings .
The Mainichi newspaper reported that last month Mr Yamaguchi was visited in hospital by James Cameron , the director of Titanic and Avatar , who is apparently considering making a film about the bombings .
Commenting on Mr Yamaguchi's death , the mayor of Nagasaki said on the city 's website that " a precious storyteller has been lost " .

Just another day at the office for Joe Thornton .
Assist .
Goal .
Shower .
“ I just love to play hockey , ” Thornton said Saturday afternoon after the Sharks ’ routine 4 - 2 dismissal of a bad Edmonton Oilers team .
To be precise , Thornton has loved playing in 353 consecutive games for the Sharks , an ongoing franchise record .
He has not missed a single opening faceoff since our beloved Los Tiburones traded for him in November 2005 .
Thornton has played through a broken toe , strep throat and trips to Buffalo .
In fact , you hate to mention prominently the consecutive - games streak , because it might jinx him .
“ Go ahead , ” Thornton said .
“ You wo n’t jinx me . ”
All right , let ’s hope the following statement does n’t jinx him either :
As of this morning , we offer a unilateral declaration that Thornton is the Bay Area ’s best athlete .
In any sport .
On any team .
On any day .
Or night .
After last spring ’s bitter early playoff defeat in which Thornton absorbed much blame — hey , it took until the eighth paragraph to bring it up — there were plenty of questions about how he would respond this season .
Thornton has responded with his best hockey since his MVP stuff of 2005 - 06 .
Yes , he is the NHL ’s second - leading scorer , trailing only Henrik Sedin of Vancouver and ahead of glamour names such as Ovechkin and Crosby .
But just watch the little things Thornton does — the faceoffs and puck - clearing and forechecking — to see why he is better than ever .
So why does that make Thornton a more superior Bay Area athlete than , say , the 49ers ’ Patrick Willis or the Warriors ’ Monta Ellis ?
It does n’t .
Not automatically .
Scoring matters .
But it ’s the size , skill and competitive push behind those numbers that make Thornton the Bay Area ’s best .
Here is what you do n’t realize until you see Thornton out of uniform :
The guy is a horse .
He is 6 - foot - 4 and 230 pounds .
You could definitely see him as a tight end in the NFL or a power - hitting baseball slugger .
In high school , Thornton indeed was a first baseman on a team that won the Ontario provincial championship .
He also played high school basketball , his dad ’s game .
But in Canada , hockey pretty much rules , eh ?
So that ’s where Thornton naturally gravitated .
However , you can count Sharks captain Rob Blake among those who believe Thornton could go toe - to - toe with just about any player , in any sport .
“ There ’s a reason Joe has played every game since he ’s been here , ” Blake said .
“ He takes care of himself and all of that .
But he ’s so strong .
Especially from the waist down , he ’s so thick .
He ’s not overly muscled .
Just thick . ”
Also , as Sharks coach Todd McLellan will tell you , hockey requires one additional degree of difficulty that other games lack .
“ Keep in mind , ” McLellan said , “ that as soon as you put those pieces of metal on the bottom of your feet , everything changes . ”
The ice skates , McLellan means .
That ’s the dividing line .
In other sports , athletes do the slam - bam things as well as the finesse things .
But hockey players have to do them within a millisecond of each other , while trying to keep their balance on skates as they go approximately a million miles per hour .
Granted , this is just one man ’s opinion .
But it says here that Thornton could do Willis ’ job with the 49ers more successfully than Willis could do Thornton ’s job with the Sharks .
And that ’s not to denigrate Willis , a legitimate All - Pro linebacker .
As for Ellis of the Warriors “ … he is n’t even an NBA All - Star .
Here is how dominant Thornton has been in his sport :
In the just - completed decade of 2000 - 09 , Thornton accumulated more points than any other NHL player .
We are talking here about the hockey equivalent of a Larry Bird or Magic Johnson in terms of the way Thornton changes a game with his passing eye and ability to make the scoreboard jump .
Not entirely by himself , of course .
Just as Bird and Johnson set up their sidekicks to finish shots , so does Thornton .
Patrick Marleau is doing what many people thought he could n’t do this season , taking over the ice on some shifts and pumping in goals .
Dany
Heatley is doing exactly what people believed he could do , shoving pucks at the net ( and following up his shots with more shots , an underrated attribute ) .
And yet “… because we see this every game at the Tank , we do n’t always realize that in other cities , customers do n’t get this kind of show .
Those annual early - spring playoff exits are always a looming sore memory , for good reason .
But you get the nagging feeling that 10 or 15 years from now , we will look back on this Thornton - led era of Sharks hockey and say : “ Damn , we did n’t appreciate that enough . ”
We should n’t make that mistake .
Thornton is the best there is around here .

I am still receiving questions about the method by which the satellite microwave measurements are calibrated to get atmospheric temperatures .
The confusion seems to have arisen because Christopher Monckton has claimed that our satellite data must be tied to the surface thermometer data , and after Climategate ( as well all know ) those traditional measurements have become suspect .
So , time for a little tutorial .
NASA ’S AQUA SATELLITE
The UAH global temperatures currently being produced come from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit ( AMSU ) flying on NASA ’s Aqua satellite .
AMSU is located on the bottom of the spacecraft ( seen below ) ; the AMSR - E instrument that I serve as the U.S. Science Team Leader for is the one on top of the satellite with the big dish .
Aqua has been operational since mid-2002 , and is in a sun-synchronous orbit that crosses the equator at about 1:30 am and pm local solar time .
The following image illustrates how AMSU , a cross - track scanner , continuously paints out an image below the spacecraft ( actually , this image comes from the MODIS visible and infrared imager on Aqua , but the scanning geometry is basically the same ) :
HOW MICROWAVE RADIOMETERS WORK
Microwave temperature sounders like AMSU measure the very low levels of thermal microwave radiation emitted by molecular oxygen in the 50 to 60 GHz oxygen absorption complex .
This is somewhat analogous to infrared temperature sounders ( for instance , the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder , AIRS , also on Aqua ) which measure thermal emission by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
As the instrument scans across the subtrack of the satellite , the radiometer ’s antenna views thirty separate ‘ footprints ’ , nominally 50 km in diameter , each over over a 50 millisecond ‘ integration time ’ .
At these microwave frequencies , the intensity of thermally - emitted radiation measured by the instrument is directly proportional to the temperature of the oxygen molecules .
The instrument actually measures a voltage , which is digitized by the radiometer and recorded as a certain number of digital counts .
It is those digital counts which are recorded on board the spacecraft and then downlinked to satellite tracking stations in the Arctic .
HOW THE DATA ARE CALIBRATED TO TEMPERATURES
Now for the important part :
How are these instrument digitized voltages calibrated in terms of temperature ?
Once every Earth scan , the radiometer antenna looks at a “ warm calibration target ” inside the instrument whose temperature is continuously monitored with several platinum resistance thermometers ( PRTs ) .
PRTs work somewhat like a thermistor , but are more accurate and more stable .
Each PRT has its own calibration curve based upon laboratory tests .
The temperature of the warm calibration target is allowed to float with the rest of the instrument , and it typically changes by several degrees during a single orbit , as the satellite travels in and out of sunlight .
While this warm calibration point provides a radiometer digitized voltage measurement and the temperature that goes along with it , how do we use that information to determine what temperatures corresponds to the radiometer measurements when looking at the Earth ?
A second calibration point is needed , at the cold end of the temperature scale .
For that , the radiometer antenna is pointed at the cosmic background , which is assumed to radiate at 2.7 Kelvin degrees .
These two calibration points are then used to interpolate to the Earth - viewing measurements , which then provides the calibrated “ brightness temperatures ” .
This is illustrated in the following graph :
The response of the AMSU is slightly non-linear , so the calibration curve in the above graph actually has slight curvature to it .
Back when all we had were Microwave Sounding Units ( MSU ) , we had to assume the instruments were linear due to a lack of sufficient pre-launch test data to determine their nonlinearity .
Because of various radiometer - related and antenna - related factors , the absolute accuracy of the calibrated Earth - viewing temperatures are probably not much better than 1 deg .
C. While this sounds like it would be unusable for climate monitoring , the important thing is that the instruments be very stable over time ; an absolute accuracy error of this size is irrelevant for climate monitoring , as long as sufficient data are available from successive satellites so that the newer satellites can be calibrated to the older satellites ’ measurements .
WHAT LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE ARE MEASURED ?
For AMSU channel 5 that we use for tropospheric temperature monitoring , that brightness temperature is very close to the vertically - averaged temperature through a fairly deep layer of the atmosphere .
The vertical profiles of each channel ’s relative sensitivity to temperature ( ‘ weighting functions ’ ) are shown in the following plot :
These weighting functions are for the nadir ( straight - down ) views of the instrument , and all increase in altitude as the instrument scans farther away from nadir .
AMSU channel 5 is used for our middle tropospheric temperature ( MT ) estimate ; we use a weighted difference between the various view angles of channel 5 to probe lower in the atmosphere , which a fairly sharp weighting function which is for our lower - tropospheric ( LT ) temperature estimate .
We use AMSU channel 9 for monitoring of lower stratospheric ( LS ) temperatures .
For those channels whose weighting functions intersect the surface , a portion of the total measured microwave thermal emission signal comes from the surface .
AMSU channels 1 , 2 , and 15 are considered “ window ” channels because the atmosphere is essentially clear , so virtually all of the measured microwave radiation comes from the surface .
While this sounds like a good way to measure surface temperature , it turns out that the microwave ’ emissivity ’ of the surface ( it ’s ability to emit microwave energy ) is so variable that it is difficult to accurately measure surface temperatures using such measurements .
The variable emissivity problem is the smallest for well - vegetated surfaces , and largest for snow - covered surfaces .
While the microwave emissivity of the ocean surfaces around 50 GHz is more stable , it just happens to have a temperature dependence which almost exactly cancels out any sensitivity to surface temperature .
POST - PROCESSING OF DATA AT UAH
The millions of calibrated brightness temperature measurements are averaged in space and time , for instance monthly averages in 2.5 degree latitude bands .
I have FORTRAN programs I have written to do this .
I then pass the averages to John Christy , who inter-calibrates the different satellites ’
AMSUs during periods when two or more satellites are operating ( which is always the case ) .
The biggest problems we have had creating a data record with long - term stability is orbit decay of the satellites carrying the MSU and AMSU instruments .
Before the Aqua satellite was launched in 2002 , all other satellites carrying MSUs or AMSUs had orbits which decayed over time .
The decay results from the fact that there is a small amount of atmospheric drag on the satellites , so they very slowly fall in altitude over time .
This leads to 3 problems for obtaining a stable long - term record of temperature .
(1) Orbit Altitude Effect on LT
The first is a spurious cooling signal in our lower tropospheric ( LT ) temperature product , which depends upon differencing measurements at different view angles .
As the satellite falls , the angle at which the instrument views the surface changes slightly .
The correction for this is fairly straightforward , and is applied to both our dataset and to the similar datasets produced by Frank Wentz and Carl Mears at Remote Sensing Systems ( RSS ) .
This adjustment is not needed for the Aqua satellite since it carries extra fuel which is used to maintain the orbit .
(2) Diurnal Drift Effect
The second problem caused by orbit decay is that the nominal local observation time begins to drift .
As a result , the measurements can increasingly be from a warmer or cooler time of day after a few years on - orbit .
Luckily , this almost always happened when another satellite operating at the same time had a relatively stable observation time , allowing us to quantify the effect .
Nevertheless , the correction is n’t perfect , and so leads to some uncertainty .
[ Instead of this empirical correction we make to the UAH products , RSS uses the day - night cycle of temperatures created by a climate model to do the adjustment for time - of - day . ]
This adjustment is not necessary for the Aqua AMSU .
(3) Instrument Body Temperature Effect .
As the satellite orbit decays , the solar illumination of the spacecraft changes , which then can alter the physical temperature of the instrument itself .
For some unknown reason , it turns out that most of the microwave radiometers ’ calibrated Earth - viewing temperatures are slightly influenced by the temperature of the instrument itself … which should not be the case .
One possibility is that the exact microwave frequency band which the instrument observes at changes slightly as the instrument warms or cools , which then leads to weighting functions that move up and down in the atmosphere with instrument temperature .
Since tropospheric temperature falls off by about 7 deg .
C for every 1 km in altitude , it is important for the ‘ local oscillators ’ governing the frequency band sensed to be very stable , so that the altitude of the layer sensed does not change over time .
This effect is , once again , empirically removed based upon comparisons to another satellite whose instrument shows little or no instrument temperature effect .
The biggest concern is the long - term changes in instrument temperature , not the changes within an orbit .
Since the Aqua satellite does not drift , the solar illumination does not change and and so there is no long - term change in the instrument ’s temperature to correct for .
One can imagine all kinds of lesser issues that might affect the long - term stability of the satellite record .
For instance , since there have been ten successive satellites , most of which had to be calibrated to the one before it with some non-zero error , there is the possibility of a small ‘ random walk ’ component to the 30 + year data record .
Fortunately , John Christy has spent a lot of time comparing our datasets to radiosonde ( weather balloon ) datasets , and finds very good long - term agreement .
Computers keep getting more powerful because silicon transistors keep getting smaller .
But that miniaturization can’t continue much further without a change to the transistors ’ design , which has remained more or less the same for 40 years .
One potential successor to today ’s silicon transistors is silicon nanowires , tiny filaments of silicon suspended like the strings of a guitar between electrically conducting pads .
But while silicon nanowires are certainly small enough to keep the miniaturization of computer circuitry on track , there ’s been doubt about whether they can pass enough electrical current for high - speed computing .
At 2008 ’s International Electron Device Meeting , researchers at MIT ’s Microsystems Technology Laboratories demonstrated silicon nanowires with twice the electron mobility — which indicates how easily current can be induced — of their predecessors .
Now , the same group has shown that they can build chips in which up to five high - performance nanowires are stacked on top of each other .
That would allow nanowire transistors to pass up to five times as much current without taking up any more area on the surface on the chip , a crucial step toward establishing the viability of silicon - nanowire transistors .
A transistor is basically a switch : when it ’s on , it passes an electrical current , and when it ’s off , it does n’t .
Flipping the switch requires charging a part of the transistor called the “ gate . ”
In today ’s design , the gate sits on top of the transistor .
But if the transistor gets small enough , electricity will leak across it whether the gate is charged or not .
Turning the switch off becomes impossible .
Because silicon nanowires are suspended in air , the gate can be wrapped all the way around them , like insulation around an electrical wire , which improves control of the switch .
But the narrowness of the nanowires limits the amount of current they can pass .
Electrical - engineering professor Judy Hoyt and her graduate students Pouya Hashemi and Leonardo Gomez improved the performance of silicon - nanowire transistors by , basically , prying the atoms of the silicon slightly farther apart than they would be naturally , which allows electrons to flow through the wires more freely .
Such “ strained silicon ” has been a standard way to improve the performance of conventional transistors since 2003 .
But Hoyt was one of the early researchers in the field .
“ Starting in the early 1990s , she ’s really played a pioneering role in strained - silicon technology , ” says Tahir Ghani , director of transistor technology and integration for Intel ’s Technology and Manufacturing Group .
“ She did a lot of this pioneering work that for the first time demonstrated that you can have significant performance gains by implementing strain into silicon technology . ”
Hoyt and her group ’s work on strained - silicon nanowires , Ghani says , “ combines the two key elements of transistors ” — performance and space efficiency — “ both of which are very key to scaling in the future .
And so from that standpoint , it makes it very relevant for industry . ”
Handling stress
To build their stacked nanowire transistors , the MIT researchers begin with a normal silicon wafer , on which they deposit a silicon - germanium composite .
Because germanium atoms are bigger than silicon atoms , the distances between atoms in the silicon - germanium layer are greater than they would be in a layer of pure silicon .
When the researchers deposit another layer of silicon on top of the composite , the silicon atoms try to align themselves with the atoms beneath them , so they , too , end up spaced slightly farther apart .
This layer of strained silicon is bound to a second silicon wafer , and the other layers are removed , leaving the second wafer covered with a base layer of strained silicon .
The researchers then stack alternating layers of silicon - germanium and silicon on top of the base layer , passing its strain on to each successive layer of silicon .
Using a technique called electron - beam lithography , the researchers pattern fine lines onto the stacks and then etch away the material between the lines .
Finally , they etch away the remaining silicon - germanium , and they ’re left with several layers of suspended silicon nanowires .
Hoyt and her students have manufactured nanowires with a diameter of only eight nanometers , which they described in a 2009 paper in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers journal Electron Device Letters ; by contrast , the smallest elements of today ’s computer chips are 45 nanometers across .
Hoyt says that her group can create silicon with two times the strain seen in chips built by commercial vendors .
“ We increase the germanium fraction of the initial layer , so we therefore build more stress into the silicon , ” Hoyt says .
Moreover , says Hashemi , “ we are the only group in the world that has showed that we can maintain this strain after suspension ” — that is , once the underlying layers have been cut away .
So far , Hoyt ’s group has built nanowire transistors in which charge is carried by moving electrons .
But to maximize computational efficiency , a standard computer chip in fact uses two types of transistors .
In the other type , charge is carried by so - called holes .
A hole is simply the absence of an electron in a crystal of semiconducting material .
When an electron slides over to fill the hole , it vacates its own spot in the crystal ; another electron slides over to fill that spot ; and so on .
In this way , the hole in effect moves along the length of the crystal .
Increasing the mobility of holes in such transistors requires a different type of strain : the atoms of the crystal actually have to be jammed closer together than is comfortable .
So Hoyt ’s group is now working to build nanowires from a silicon - germanium composite , where intervening layers of pure silicon cause compression rather than tension .

Republican pollster Frank Luntz — the brains behind Newt Gingrich ’s “ Contract With America ” and the man who coined politically potent phrases like the “ death tax ” — wants to help environmentalists in their push for legislation to combat climate change .
His advice ?
Stop talking about climate change .
The environmental community is “ fighting the wrong battle , ” Luntz announced on Thursday at an event to mark the release of a new report by his polling firm , The Word Doctors , outlining strategies to help marshal public support for a climate bill .
“ The least important component of climate change is climate change . ”
Luntz ’s report , “ The Language of a Clean Energy Economy , ” finds that the majority of the public across the political spectrum is convinced that global warming is happening and caused at least in part by humans .
But , Luntz says , talking about the problem wo n’t win support for the legislation that would solve it .
Among both Democrats and Republicans polled by his firm , addressing climate change was the least important reason to support a cap - and - trade policy .
So what should environmentalists say instead ?
Luntz suggests less talk of dying polar bears and more emphasis on how legislation will create jobs , make the planet healthier and decrease US dependence on foreign oil .
Advocates should emphasize words like “ cleaner , ” “ healthier , ” and “ safer ” ; scrap “ green jobs ” in favor of “ American jobs , ” and ditch terms like “ sustainability ” and “ carbon neutral ” altogether .
“ It does n’t matter if there is or is n’t climate change , ” he said .
“ It ’s still in America ’s best interest to develop new sources of energy that are clean , reliable , efficient and safe . ”
Luntz is n’t the first public opinion expert to suggest this course of action — but until recently he was better known among environmentalists for furnishing the GOP with sophisticated strategies to kill any prospect of climate action during the Bush years .
In 2002 Luntz authored an influential memo advising Republicans to green their public image while sowing public confusion about global warming .
Republicans should “ continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate ” because otherwise , he warned , “ [s ] hould the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled , their views about global warming will change accordingly . ”
Two Bush initiatives that were vintage Luntz : the timber - industry - friendly “ Healthy Forests Initiative ” and the “ Clear Skies Act ” that loosened restrictions on polluters .
Many Republicans still seem to be working from Luntz ’s playbook .
But he acknowledged at Thursday ’s event that the effort to muddy the public discussion over the science of climate change had failed .
“ It does n’t matter whether you call it climate change or global warming , ” he said .
“ The public believes it ’s happening , and they believe that humans are playing a part in it . ”
In fact , Luntz warned that if Republicans continue to dispute climate science it could hurt them politically .
Instead , he said , the GOP should be engaging in the debate over to solve America ’s energy problems .
“ You have to do something new , and you have to do it better , ” he said .
“ If you are representing the polices of the past , you will be kicked out . ”
Now that Luntz has changed course on climate , is his advice to environmentalists any better than his former counsel to the GOP ?
As it happens , many advocates of climate legislation have already started moving in the direction that Luntz is proposing .
The cap - and - trade bill that passed the House last year is titled the “ American Clean Energy and Security Act , ” and the version currently circulating in the Senate version is called the “ Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act . ”
( The Senate bill even eschews any talk of cap - and - trade , though Luntz balked at the Democrats ’ alternative term — ” Global Warming Pollution Reduction and Investment ” — because it uses the words “ global warming . ” )
President Barack Obama rarely talks about climate , focusing instead on jobs and economic growth .
So far , though , all the positive spin has n’t made the hard task of passing legislation any easier .
HTC has been talking about Android 2.0 and 2.1 for a long time now .
If you own an HTC Magic , you ’re most likely running on Android 1.6 already , but if you ’re a proud owner of HTC ’s flagship HTC Hero , you ’ve been stuck on Android 1.5 since launch .
Meteor ( an Irish mobile operator ) has just announced that HTC will be rolling out Android 2.1 to the Hero in late March .
Just got another update on this and HTC have said they are releasing 2.1 on the Hero and we are hoping to have this available by the end of March .
This will be available via the HTC website and we are also looking at other ways to make this update easier to access for our customers .
As soon as I hear any more on this I ’ll let you all now because I know the release of 2.1 is something that everyone is looking forward to .
This is great news for Meteor customers and those who purchased an unlocked GSM HTC Hero .
Now let ’s just hope that Sprint and Verizon and give us an update on when they plan on rolling out their OTA android 2.1 releases for their CDMA DROID Eris and Hero handsets .

On the April afternoon I visited Darius Sarshar in his office overlooking the shimmering South China Sea , a deal was on the horizon .
Seven stories above Kota Kinabalu , the bustling capital of Malaysia ’s Sabah state , the 40 - year - old British expat said he was close to closing a transaction — one that could alter the future of environmental conservation .
Sarshar oversees the Malua BioBank , an 84,000 - acre patch of jungle on the northern tip of Borneo that is the centerpiece of an ambitious experiment to see whether a rainforest can turn a profit if it is restored and then simply left alone .
A palm oil trade group appeared poised to partner with New Forests , the Australian investment company that created the BioBank , virtually ensuring the project ’s success .
“ We ’re working to get the green light , ” Sarshar said .
“ I ’m 99 percent certain we will .
It ’s very exciting . ”
Eagerly explaining the potential deal , in which the palm oil producers would preserve part of Borneo ’s remaining jungle as a step toward earning an eco-label , Sarshar and Maree Candish , New Forests ’
Asia director , were practically finishing each other ’s sentences .
“ It ’s a win - win , ” said Candish , “ because the companies get into a scheme that encourages good practices , and there ’s also money coming in for conservation .
The problem in these countries is , you can draw a line on a map and say that it ’s conserved , but unless you ’ve actually got the funds — ”
“ Companies love it , ” Sarshar jumped in .
“ ‘ I pay some money now and you ’ll protect the forest for 50 years and I ’m off the hook and I can get certified ?
Fantastic !' ”
If all goes according to plan , the Malua BioBank will represent a fusion of environmentalism and entrepreneurialism that its proponents say is the only way to save the world ’s disappearing “ natural capital ” from destruction .
“ Ecosystems and nature need to have value in order to be assets , like any other on a balance sheet , that people will invest in maintaining , ” says David Brand , New Forests ’ founder .
It ’s a challenging , controversial notion :
After decades of exploiting the environment for financial gain , saving it could be just as lucrative as destroying it .
MY TRIP TO THE MALUA BioBank began with a two - hour drive down the asphalt highway that crosses eastern Sabah .
For much of the ride , the only scenery is row after row of oil palm , one of the world ’s least attractive trees .
Dense forest once covered the land — lush , canopied jungle with low - hanging clouds clinging to the treetops .
But now , the rises and valleys contain only the stumpy palms , limp in the scorching sun .
Just outside the dusty town of Lahad Datu is a dirt road that winds through the Ulu Segama Malua Forest Reserve .
Decades of unchecked logging have wiped out most of the reserve ’s massive dipterocarps , tropical trees that can grow to more than 250 feet tall .
Yet even the sight of the short , slender , second - growth hardwoods now springing up there comes as a relief after all that palm .
Almost half of Sabah ’s forests , and half of Borneo ’s forests overall , are already gone — cleared , burned , or bulldozed .
Palm oil , an ingredient in nearly half of all processed foods and an increasingly popular biofuel , has driven much of the deforestation .
Between 2005 and 2007 alone , an area bigger than Delaware was cleared for palm plantations in Indonesian Borneo .
Most of the schoolchildren who visit Sabah ’s new Rainforest Discovery Center have never set foot in an actual rainforest .
Among the scores of species facing oblivion are gibbons , pygmy elephants , flying lemurs , and sun bears — as well as orangutans , which could become extinct in the wild within a few decades .
Sandwiched between palm plantations and the protected virgin jungle of the Danum Valley , the Malua forest is “ a line - in - the - sand spot , ” according to Brand .
It is lowland forest , prime orangutan habitat , and the island ’s most endangered ecosystem because it is easily accessible for logging and farming .
Close to 98 percent of the BioBank ’s terrain has been logged at some point .
Two years ago , New Forests raised $ 10 million from private investors and handed it over to the Sabah government to restore Malua and to enact a 50 - year moratorium on selling its timber .
In August 2008 , the company issued 3.4 million “ biodiversity conservation certificates , ” each representing roughly 1,075 square feet of forest .
The shares sell for $ 10 apiece ; New Forests hopes to sell all of them in the next five years , generating $ 34 million .
( Investors may resell their shares . )
The first 20 percent of that revenue will go into a trust fund for the long - term protection of the reserve .
New Forests will then use the remaining $ 27 million to return its investors ’ original $ 10 million plus half of the net profits , with the other half going to the Sabah government .
Once New Forests sells out its Malua shares , it plans to use the profits to replicate the BioBank in other parts of Borneo , and possibly around the world .
Within the BioBank , a small staff has set up headquarters in a former logging camp , patrolling for illegal land clearing and poaching .
It can be dangerous work :
In April , Indra Sunjoto , a soft - spoken 39 - year - old forest officer , arrested a deer hunter ; that night the poacher returned with a machete - wielding posse , smashing cars and setting upon Sunjoto with sticks .
Undeterred , Sunjoto ’s crew is mapping out a forest restoration plan , pinpointing logged areas for replanting .
A wildlife team has installed nest boxes for hornbills and set up salt licks that are now ringed by footprints : the deep , flat disk of the pygmy elephant , the butterfly - shaped hoof of the banteng , a species of wild cattle .
A chain - and - rope bridge across the Malua River — the first of three — will help connect the area ’s 650 orangutans , which do n’t like to swim , with populations on the other shore .
After 50 years , the Sabah government can renew the conservation agreement with New Forests or use the earnings from the trust fund to restore other regions .
“ When we get to that point , ” said Candish , “ the people of Sabah can decide , ‘ Yes , we love our forest and it ’s generating income from ecotourism and of course we want to keep it , ’ or , ‘ No , there ’s something new and exciting we can do with the land . ’
And that ’s their decision to make . ”
The BioBank is modeled after an existing ecosystem market in the United States .
Under the Endangered Species Act , developers who destroy habitat for protected species can buy credits in the form of habitat that ’s been preserved elsewhere in conservation “ banks . ”
A similar system for conserving wetlands has spawned a billion - dollar - a - year trade in ecosystem credits .
What makes the BioBank unique — and its chances of success unclear — is that it ’s attempting to get companies to invest in biodiversity in the absence of any legal requirements to do so .
To lure buyers , New Forests is offering a mix of preservation , profit — and good PR .
Under the scheme Darius Sarshar was discussing with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil , its members would use Malua certificates as a way to atone for past deforestation , purchasing an acre ’s worth of Malua for every acre of forest they cleared before joining the group .
In turn , their products would receive certification under a program akin to the Forest Stewardship Council ‘s for wood .
( Roundtable members have promised to clear no additional forest . )
If the Roundtable were to sign on to Malua , companies like Cargill , which imported more than 286 million tons of palm oil last year , would have a built - in eco-marketing pitch .
“ Palm oil ” — whose reputation is far worse in the United Kingdom due to the efforts of Greenpeace and other activist groups — ” has this image that it ’s about trashing forests and killing orangutans , ” said Sarshar .
“ But suddenly we can get beyond all this discussion of the past and the bad image , and the more palm oil you buy , the more forest gets conserved .
It just turns the logic completely on its head . ”
FOR DECADES , conservation has followed the basic model that the best way to save vulnerable ecosystems and species is to set aside land through either government mandate or private largesse .
The limits of that approach are obvious ; according to the United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment , human activity is depleting natural resources so rapidly that “ the ability of the planet ’s ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted . ”
“ We ’ve tried a lot of things in terms of dealing with a $ 70 trillion economy on a finite planet , and unfortunately most of it is failing , ” says Brand .
That ’s why scientists , environmentalists , and investors — including Goldman Sachs , the World Bank , and an emerging cluster of what might be called private eco-equity firms like New Forests — are embracing a market - based approach that treats conservation not simply as an ecological imperative , but an economic one as well .
If natural treasures such as Malua ’s forest are truly worth more intact than eviscerated , the reasoning goes , their value must be made tangible .
“ It ’s not so much about putting a price tag on nature , ” says Gretchen Daily , a Stanford ecologist and a leading researcher in the field known as “ ecosystem services . ”
“ It ’s a much more elaborate process of changing people ’s values , bringing to light the many values nature has . ”
Unless we can find a way to appraise nature and then invest in protecting it , says Daily , “ our basic life - support systems are going to collapse . ”
Ecosystem markets identify the services nature provides — freshwater , fertile soil , flood protection , and carbon absorption , to name a few — and then , sometimes through regulation , create a framework for assigning an economic value to preserving them .
The best estimates of the total value of the world ’s ecosystem services are somewhere between $ 17 and $ 56 trillion .
But there ’s little doubt that much of that value is being squandered .
According to initial calculations from a European study , the global economy is losing as much as $ 5 trillion a year in natural resources , the equivalent of 7 percent of the global GDP .
Ecosystem - services - based conservation has been gaining traction for more than a decade , but its moment may finally have arrived .
The carbon - offset market established by the Kyoto treaty , the world ’s largest ecosystem market , is worth $ 126 billion ; existing global markets for forests , water quality , open space , and other resources are valued at around $ 25 billion .
Last May , Prince Charles introduced the idea of “ rainforest bonds , ” issued by the World Bank , to raise as much as $ 25 billion to protect tropical forests .
At this December ’s United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen , one of the biggest topics on the agenda is Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation ( REDD ) — a complex program designed to give developing countries financial incentives to stop deforestation .
( See “ GM ’s Money Trees . ” )
A study released in June found that Indonesia could generate as much money from storing carbon in its forests as from cutting them down to produce palm oil .
Critics of ecosystem markets argue that to truly protect the natural world we must value it for its own sake , not because it helps the bottom line .
In a September 2006 commentary in the journal Nature , Stanford biologist Douglas J. McCauley wrote that “ to make ecosystem services the foundation of our conservation strategies is to imply … that nature is only worth conserving when it is , or can be made , profitable . ”
Which , you could say , is what got us into this mess in the first place .
Skeptics also argue that monetizing nature risks exposing it to the fads and follies of the market ; the price of biodiversity would bounce around like that of any other commodity .
Additionally , rewarding conservation could create a perverse incentive to cut down additional forests to drive up the price of those that remain .
What if , say , Indonesia clears its peat swamps before REDD takes effect to increase its potential reforestation profits ?
In an August editorial in the journal Conservation Biology , two scientists cautioned that protecting ecosystem services may not protect ecosystems themselves : Conceivably , in the name of carbon storage , you could raze an old - growth forest and set up a tree plantation engineered to soak up the greatest amount of CO 2 — and economic value .
A COUPLE OF MONTHS after I met Sarshar , things at the Malua BioBank hit a snag .
The Roundtable , he reported , was concerned about the limited practical value of biobanks as offset mechanisms because there are none in the other regions where its members have cleared land .
( For instance , you ’re not supposed to offset the destruction of peat forest by protecting lowland forest . )
It was a chicken - and - egg - type problem , since the Malua deal was supposed to help fund the additional biobanks the palm oil producers wanted .
Ironically , Sarshar was optimistic that regulation might save his free - market experiment ; Indonesian officials had told him they wanted to develop rules that would spawn new biobanks with guaranteed buyers .
At press time , New Forests had sold only $ 215,000 worth of BioBank certificates , to the operator of an eco-resort in the Danum Valley and a few logging contractors .
For now , the future of Malua — and other voluntary ecosystem markets — remains uncertain .
“ It ’s a very pioneering project , ” says Nathaniel Carroll , director of biodiversity markets at Ecosystem Marketplace , a website run by the think tank Forest Trends .
“ So if it failed , it would n’t mean the market is n’t there .
It ’d be because it ’s ahead of its time . ”
Behind the drama unfolding in the streets of Iran , the regime is quietly clamping down on some of the nation 's best students by derailing their academic and professional careers .
On Wednesday , progovernment militia attacked and beat students at a school in northeastern Iran .
Since last Sunday 's massive protests nationwide , dozens of university students have been arrested as part of an aggressive policy against what are known as Iran 's " star students . "
In most places , being a star means ranking top of the class , but in Iran it means your name appears on a list of students considered a threat by the intelligence ministry .
It also means a partial or complete ban from education .
The term comes from the fact that some students have learned of their status by seeing stars printed next to their names on test results .
Mehrnoush Karimi , a 24 - year - old law - school hopeful , found out in August that she was starred .
She ranked 55 on this year 's national entrance exam for law schools , out of more than 70,000 test - takers .
That score should have guaranteed her a seat at the school of her choice .
Instead , the government told her she would n't be attending law school due to her " star " status .

He considers it crucial in order to keep abreast of all the ingenious technology which , once debugged by the world 's most acquisitive consumers , will wind up in American and European shops a year or two later .
Each time he packs his bags , though , he is embarrassed by having to include a dog - eared set of notes that really ought to be locked up in a safe .
This is his list of logons and passwords for all the websites he uses for doing business and staying in touch with the rest of the world .
At the last count , the inch - thick list accumulated over the past decade or so — your correspondent 's sole copy — includes access details for no fewer than 174 online services and computer networks .

He admits to flouting the advice of security experts : his failings include using essentially the same logon and password for many similar sites , relying on easily remembered words — and , heaven forbid , writing them down on scraps of paper .
So his new year 's resolution is to set up a proper software vault for the various passwords and ditch the dog -eared list .
Your correspondent 's one consolation is that he is not alone in using easily crackable words for most of his passwords .
Indeed , the majority of online users have an understandable aversion to strong , but hard - to - remember , passwords .
The most popular passwords in Britain are “ 123 ” followed by “ password ” .
At least people in America have learned to combine letters and numbers .
Their most popular ones are “ password1 ” followed by “ abc123 ” .
Unfortunately , the easier a password is to remember , the easier it is for thieves to guess .
Ironically , the opposite — the harder it is to remember , the harder it is to crack — is often far from true .
That is because , not being able to remember long , jumbled sets of alphanumeric characters interspersed with symbols , people resort to writing them down on Post - it notes left lying around the office or home for all and sundry to see .
Apart from stealing passwords from Post - it notes and the like , intruders basically use one of two hacks to gain access to other people 's computers or networks .
If time and money is no problem , they can use brute - force methods that simply try every combination of letters , numbers and symbols until a match is found .
That takes a lot of patience and computing power , and tends to be the sort of thing only intelligence agencies indulge in .
A more popular , though less effective , way is to use commercial software tools such as “ L0 phtCrack ” or “ John the Ripper ” that can be found on the internet .
These use dictionaries , lists of popular passwords and rainbow tables ( lookup tools that turn long numbers computed from alphanumeric characters back into their original plain text ) to recover passwords .
According to Bruce Schneier , an independent security expert , today 's password crackers “ can test tens — even hundreds — of millions of passwords per second . ”
In short , the vast majority of passwords used in the real world can be guessed in minutes .
And do not think you are being smart by replacing the letters “ l ” or “ i ” in a password with the number “ 1 ” ; or the letter “ s ” with the number “ 5 ” or the symbol “ $ ” .
Cracking programs check all such alternatives , and more , as a matter of course .
What should you do to protect yourself ?
Choose passwords that are strong enough to make cracking them too time consuming for thieves to bother .
The strength of a password depends on its length , complexity and randomness .
A good length is at least eight symbols .
The complexity depends on the character set .
Using numbers alone limits the choice to just ten symbols .
Add upper - and lower - case letters and the complexity rises to 62 .
Use all the symbols on a standard ASCII keyboard and you have 95 to choose from .
The third component , randomness , is measured by a concept borrowed from thermodynamics — the notion of entropy ( the tendency for things to become disordered ) .
In information theory , a tossed coin has an entropy of one “ bit ” ( binary digit ) .
That is because it can come down randomly in one of two equally possible binary states .
At the other extreme , when you set the encryption of a Wi -Fi link , you are usually given the choice of 64 - bit or even 128 - bit security .
Those bit -numbers represent the entropy ( or randomness ) of the encryption used .
A password with 64 bits of entropy is as strong as a string of data comprising 64 randomly selected binary digits .
Put another way , a 64 - bit password would require 2 raised to the power of 64 attempts to crack it by brute force — in short , 18 billion billion attempts .
A 64 - bit password was finally cracked in 2002 using brute - force methods .
It took a network of volunteers nearly five years to do so .
The National Institute of Standards and Technology , the American government 's standards - measuring laboratory in Gaithersburg , Maryland , recommends 80 - bit passwords for state secrets and the like .
Such security can be achieved using passwords with 12 symbols , drawn from the full set of 95 symbols on the standard American keyboard .
For ordinary purposes , that would seem overkill .
A 52 - bit password based on eight symbols selected from the standard keyboard is generally adequate .
How to select the eight ?
Best to let a computer program generate them randomly for you .
Unfortunately , the result will be something like 6 s Dt % k&3 that probably needs to be written down .
One answer , only slightly less rigorous , is to use a mnemonic constructed from the first letters ( plus contractions ) of an easily remembered phrase like “ Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts ” ( MCa1otFA ) or “ To be or not to be : that is the question ” ( 2 Bo - 2 b : ? ) .
Given a robust 52 - bit password , you can then use a password manager to take care of the dozens of easily guessable ones used to access various web services .
There are a number of perfectly adequate products for doing this .
In an early attempt to fulfil his new year 's pledge , your correspondent has been experimenting with LastPass , a free password manager that works as an add - on to the Firefox web browser for Windows , Linux or Macintosh .
Versions also exist for Internet Explorer on Windows and Safari on the Mac .
Once installed and given a strong password of its own , plus an e-mail address , LastPass encrypts all the logons and passwords stored on your computer .
So , be warned : forget your master password and you could be in trouble — especially if you have let the program delete ( as it urges you to let it do ) all the vulnerable logons and passwords on your own computer .
Thereafter , to visit various web services , all you have to do is log into LastPass and click the website you wish to check out .
The tool then automatically logs you on securely to the selected site .
It will even complete all the forms needed to buy goods online if you have stored your home address , telephone number and credit - card details in the vault as well .
Your correspondent looks forward to using the service while travelling around Japan over the next month or so .
To be on the safe side , however , his dog -eared list of passwords will still go with him .
When Doug Engelbart was a kid , he and his brother used to practice trick bike riding .
They got so they could bend over and scoop something off the ground while riding ( without losing speed and without squatting down ) , ride their bikes backwards seated on their handlebars , and other fancy feats .
When it came time for his own kids to learn how to ride a bike , at a time when most kids would go from riding a tricycle , to riding a bicycle with training wheels , and finally riding a bicycle without training wheels , Doug figured he could just skip the with training wheels part .
After all , their only function was to keep the bike from falling over !
Doug knew from practiced experience and an inquisitive analytical mind that as you pedal along , all it takes to keep the bike from falling over is steering .
In fact , the reason you do n’t fall over is you are constantly making tiny corrections , and sometimes last - minute bigger corrections , with your handlebars ( or , if you ’re a big shot riding with no hands , by shifting your weight ) .
What you ’re actually doing without thinking is sensing the bike starting to tilt , and reacting by steering the bike in that same direction just enough to un - tilt your bike and straighten out more or less , over and over again .
This becomes very evident as you slow down to a stop , if you keep your feet on the pedals you will automatically try to use steering to keep the bike from falling over .
Somehow everyone who ever learned to ride a bike learned this .
It turns out , you do n’t have to steer if you just get a gentle , even back and forth see - sawing motion going with the handlebars as you roll along , the back and forth motion usually corrects the tilting soon enough and you wo n’t fall .
In fact , someone with little or no bike riding experience at all can just see - saw their handlebars as they pedal and mostly not fall .
So this is how Doug taught kids to ride .
First he would show them how he could see - saw his handlebars back and forth while he pedaled slowly on his bike .
Then he would ask them to try the same thing as he walked alongside , holding onto the bike loosely just to help it maintain a reasonable speed , and to keep it / them from falling when they over - or under - corrected .
As long as they kept moving forward and see- sawing the handlebars , they would naturally start to get a feel for this direct relationship between tilting , steering and untilting , and gradually start refining the motions , and pretty soon off they ’d go .
He found it helped to have the kids play around with how gentle or exaggerated the see - sawing motions needed to be to stay upright .
It also helped to practice in a wide open space to avoid having to make any turns or run into stuff — a quiet street , empty parking lot , or even a mowed field will do .
Practicing how to stop is important too .
So that ’s the trick to learning to ride without training wheels .
As a matter of fact , training wheels can actually impede the learning process by interfering with the tilting - steering - untilting cause and effect experience , either by keeping the bike from tilting , or with looser training wheels , by training the kids to keep the bike from falling by leaning into one training wheel or the other rather than steering .
Doug ’s inquisitive nature , adventurous attitude , compassion , and patience were a key part of his success with this method .
He never coined a term for it , but in later years one of his daughters referred to it as his “ wibble - wobble method ” — one of his lesser known but highly endearing innovations .
A remote - controlled bomb killed a Tehran University physics professor near his home early Tuesday , in what Iranian authorities called an assassination backed by Western powers , including the U.S. and Israel .

The fancy age - progression science touted by the FBI has turned out to be just grafting the hair of Spanish politician Gaspar Llamazares onto bin Laden 's head .
Gaspar Llamazares , meanwhile , is pissed .
Why I am a Christian
England is a Christian country .
The Queen is both Head of State and Head of the Church of England ; seats in one of the Houses of Parliament are reserved for bishops .
Until quite recently the great majority of people in positions of influence in England were baptized and confirmed members of the national church .
Regular churchgoing has become less widespread than it was , but still at the last census almost three - quarters of the British population identified themselves as Christian .
Even those who are not themselves believers have normally been respectful towards Christianity .
Those of us who take our Christianity seriously have not traditionally made much noise about that .
Public parades of religiosity are not an attractive spectacle – certainly they are not the British way .
But over the last decade or so , a major factor has changed .
Suddenly , for the first time ever , it has become fashionable among the metropolitan opinion - forming classes to express open hostility to religion in general or to Christianity in particular .
In this situation it becomes appropriate for those of us who want to see England remain a Christian country to speak up to defend our religion , in a way that might not have been necessary until recently .
To explain why I shall see it as a tragedy if England abandons its Christian heritage , let me quote some recent remarks that had nothing to do with religion , by the director of a company which specializes in advising Western firms that aim to do business in China .
He commented :
We are brought up to think there are some fundamental ground rules that people follow that are not the law but are a higher level of operating than the law , and people abide by them because it is considered fair and reasonable to do so .
But the Chinese are brought up from a fairly early age to believe that the only thing that is important is to win .
( Geoff Mills of the SIP Group , interviewed by Bryan Glick in Computing , 6 Dec 2007 . )
I spent years as a young man intensively studying China , its language , its history , and its culture , and I believe Geoff Mills ’s comments are a fair summary of a deep difference between the respective societies as they have evolved over two ( or in China ’s case three ) millennia .
From my studies I took away an immense admiration for many aspects of Chinese civilization .
Until a fairly short time ago , impartial observers would certainly have had to see China as a more developed , sophisticated society than that of England or Europe ( it was only with our Industrial Revolution that we overtook China materially ) .
But greatly as I admired China , I also came away from my studies profoundly thankful that I happened to be born English , and that thankfulness had much to do with the issue discussed by Mills .
English people , and Europeans more generally , have a sense that there are principles which are higher than any rules laid down by human agencies , and which we are entitled to expect our governors as well as one another to respect .
A society imbued with that sense has a better chance , I believe , to offer its members decent and fulfilling lives than one without it .
Whether or not one is oneself a believing Christian , one must concede that as a matter of historical fact it is Christianity which has implanted the sense described by Mills in England and Europe .
Conversely , China has never been a society in which religion was a significant factor .
When Buddhism reached China , many centuries after China had already become a literate , sophisticated society , it spread widely among the common people at the level of colourful ritual , but Buddhism ( which in countries such as Ceylon is a highly intellectual structure of thought ) never had any appeal to influential Chinese thinkers – very unlike Europe , where much philosophical thought grew out of Christianity .
Westerners sometimes talk of China as having traditionally been “ Confucian ” .
But it is stretching the word “ religion ” to apply it to Confucianism , as if that were a system of thought about ultimate issues analogous to Christianity or Buddhism .
Confucius ’s doctrines provided a range of political precepts , but they are doctrines about society and the here and now – Confucius avoided discussing , and discouraged his followers from discussing , topics which we would classify as “ religious ” .
( See the Confucian Analects , e.g. 7.17 , 7.20 , 11.11 . )
And this lack of a central place for religion in the Chinese tradition has much to do , I believe , with the aspect of Chinese life identified by Geoff Mills .
A Chinese can hope that his rulers will be benevolent rather than selfish or hostile , and at many points in Chinese history they were benevolent ; but if they were not , there was no higher “ court of appeal ” to which Emperor as well as subjects saw themselves as subordinate .
European rulers might behave badly , but at least they normally recognized that they “ ought ” to behave well – and the general recognition , inspired by Christianity , that rulers as well as subjects are answerable to a higher law led to the evolution of political constitutions which systematically offered subjects various degrees of protection against arbitrary action by rulers .
The point is not just about ruler / ruled relationships but about relationships between individuals , outside the political domain .
We have a structure of civil law to which individuals can resort if other individuals mistreat them badly enough , but not many of us take every advantage we can of other people up to the point where they could successfully sue us if we went further .
Christianity tells us to love our neighbour as ourselves .
We do not come up to that high ideal , and Sunday after Sunday those of us who are churchgoers admit aloud that we have failed yet again .
But people try ; they may not manage to go the whole way , but they treat one another very much better than they might if Christ ’s injunction had not been heard in our society .
Does that mean that non-believers cannot be good people ?
Of course it does not ; many are .
But they are like people who live off inherited wealth without maintaining or increasing it : it works fine for a while , but it will not last indefinitely .
An English atheist at the beginning of the 21st century who leads a morally exemplary life is the descendant of generations of people , most of whom until quite recently would have taken the authority of the Church for granted ; the rules of life which they internalized have rubbed off on descendants who in some cases repudiate that authority .
Without the continuing reinforcement of Christian belief , it is implausible that those approaches to life will maintain themselves generation after generation into the future , in face of all the temptations to more selfish ways of living .
What is more , we already see that they are not maintaining themselves , at both ends of the social hierarchy .
The area of English society commonly said to have been least thoroughly penetrated by Christianity is the urban working class ; at the beginning of the 21st century , the idea that inner-city society is “ broken ” and sliding towards a Hobbesian war of all against all has become a media cliché .
More worryingly , since the tone of any society is set largely from the top , our governors also seem to be abandoning traditional moral constraints .
Peter Oborne in The Triumph of the Political Class ( 2007 ) documents many ways in which members of what he calls our “ Political Class ” are systematically repudiating standards of behaviour which their recent predecessors would have taken for granted as binding on them , and which we whom they govern still do acknowledge as binding on ourselves :
During the decades following the Second World War concepts of honour , duty and moral responsibility generally weighed high in the minds of politicians and counted for more than careerist considerations .
This was partly because politicians were more closely connected with mainstream morality than has subsequently become the case …
If Tony Blair had sacked lying or abusive ministers his policy would have sent out a message that the Political Class shared the ethical standards of mainstream society .
Instead the decision to protect them created a dual reality .
There was the world lived in by the Political Class , where men like Keith Vaz , Stephen Byers and David Blunkett were officially signed off as honest and decent by the Prime Minister of the day .
Meanwhile there was an outside world , where they could be detected at once as liars or imposters .
These alternate structures of perception and morality are beginning to tear British political society to shreds .
That “ mainstream morality ” was instilled in our society through Christianity , and it is probably no accident that those in charge of our society are abandoning it at the same period when many of them are for the first time beginning to express open hostility to Christianity .
Where this new atheism is likely ultimately to lead was well discussed by Jonathan Sacks ( himself a leading Jewish rabbi ) in the Spectator , 15 Jun 2013 :
religion has social , cultural and political consequences , and you cannot expect the foundations of western civilisation to crumble and leave the rest of the building intact .
That is what the greatest of all atheists , Nietzsche , understood with terrifying clarity and what his latter - day successors fail to grasp at all .
/ Time and again in his later writings he tells us that losing Christian faith will mean abandoning Christian morality .
No more “ Love your neighbour as yourself ” ; instead the will to power …
“ An act of injury , violence , exploitation or destruction cannot be called ‘ unjust ’ as such , because life functions essentially in an injurious , violent , exploitative and destructive manner . ”
The metropolitan élite who are happy to eliminate religion from our national life undoubtedly believe that we shall be able to find ways of getting on fine without it .
Our chattering classes currently have a strange tendency to perceive international organizations as possessing a moral authority superior to anything rooted in our particular country , and some of them would probably argue that European legislation or UN declarations on human rights will provide the moral fibre for which we used to look to the Church .
But the EU and the UN are human organizations , so they cannot constitute moral touchstones superior to fallible human decision - makers .
Someone who believes that he must not , say , murder asylum - seekers just because those currently in charge of the EU or the UN forbid it should , logically , think it quite all right to murder asylum - seekers if a new generation of political leaders with different ideas were to come along and change EU and UN policies .
In a decent society , people believe that they should not kill because it is wrong , not because certain other human beings tell them not to .
Already we are beginning to encounter a brutality in the atmosphere of English public life that was not there when I was a young man .
In 2007 , for instance , the House of Commons science and technology committee considered the law on abortion and recommended dropping the current requirement for two doctors to consent to an abortion ( to guard against it being done too casually ) ; according to Dr Evan Harris , MP , a member of that committee , “ The argument [ is ] , it is n’t different from any other treatment ” .
( Quoted in the Daily Telegraph , 30 Apr 2008 . )
I do not pretend to know for sure whether our current abortion law is a good or a bad law – abortion is an extremely difficult issue .
But I am absolutely clear that taking the life of a helpless human being needs to be considered as an act with moral implications massively more significant than run -of - the - mill medical treatments .
When Christianity was more firmly entrenched in our public life , I do not believe the argument quoted by Dr Harris would have occurred to anyone .
In May 2011 various members of the British metropolitan élite dismissed Rowan Williams , the then Archbishop of Canterbury , as naïve and quite out of order for raising moral objections to the action of American forces who invaded Pakistan and assassinated Osama bin Laden , together with some others with him , without prior negotiation with the Pakistani authorities .
So far as I could see , the Archbishop was doing precisely the job he was paid to do , and in previous generations this would have been generally recognized ; people might have disagreed with his interpretation of moral principles , but they would have seen that as a subject for debate , not just something to dismiss in favour of “ might is right ” .
( Personally , I agreed with the Archbishop .
For many years , Irishmen who committed appalling atrocities in the Troubles escaped to the USA , which consistently ignored every British request for extradition .
Would it have been acceptable for our special forces to go into Philadelphia or Boston and just gun them down , together with whoever happened to be in the same room at the time ?
I would have said not , and I am fairly sure that most Americans would agree . )
No doubt England will stagger on for some time to come with enough remnants of morality to offer a somewhat tolerable life to some proportion of the population .
But the ultimate end - point of the direction in which we are drifting was described by George Orwell in 1984 : “ If you want a picture of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face – for ever . ”
This is all very well , the reader may object , but Christianity depends on accepting the literal truth of an extraordinary story about happenings very remote from us in time .
“ How do you know that Jesus Christ really was the Son of God who after his death on the cross rose again on the third day ? ”
Well of course I do n’t know this or the rest of it in the direct way that I know , say , that daffodils bloom in my garden in spring .
I have heard of people who claim that they are directly aware of the presence of God or are as certain of the truth of the Gospels as of the facts of their everyday surroundings , but personally I do not understand at all how that could be .
On the other hand , I also do not see much sense in the attitude that it ’s all obviously just fairy stories , because people do n’t rise from the dead , change water into wine , or what not .
That reaction to my mind bespeaks a naive failure to grasp how extraordinary the everyday world is , as described by sober natural scientists many of whom have no religious belief .
We all know that a thing cannot be in two different places at once , yet the physicist Richard Feynman explains to us in his 1985 book QED that fundamental particles routinely travel not along one of the various paths available to them but along all of them simultaneously , and if they did not then some quite ordinary features of the world would look different from the way they do .
If the world revealed by science can be as utterly counter - intuitive as it is , I see no grounds to dismiss out of hand the strange stories in the New Testament .
( Indeed , I suspect the supernatural quality of some of the discourse which Christianity made central to European intellectual life is part of what gave European scientists the imagination to create the surprising but powerful scientific theories which have been crucial to the inauguration of the modern world . )
Saying that something is not ruled out a priori is a long way from saying it must be true , of course .
Two thousand years is a long time and the Gospels are brief and unsystematic records , so is it sensible to give them credence ?
Well , I believe there are stronger reasons to do so than is sometimes supposed by present - day sceptics who are accustomed to the level of documentation associated with modern media .
Read , for instance , William Paley ’s Evidences of Christianity ( 1794 ) : he argues , at length and persuasively , that the behaviour of members of the early church would be incomprehensible , if the disciples had not actually had the experience of meeting and speaking to the resurrected Christ .
The writer A.N. Wilson ( who abandoned Christianity in the 1980s , but returned to it twenty years later ) made the same point in 2010 :
Who appeared ( in the testimony of Paul written only 20 years after the event ) to over 500 people in Jerusalem after the Crucifixion ?
Was it a phantom ?
Was it a fake ?
Were they lying ?
Quite possibly , of course .
But then you have to wonder why those who concocted the fake were prepared to spend uncomfortable lives as missionaries , undergoing shipwrecks , persecutions and stoning , preaching this illusion so ardently ; and why or how they found the courage to die heroic martyrs ’ deaths defending this “ lie ” ?
( The Spectator , 3 Apr 2010 )
Certainly the records are thin , compared with the records of a significant twentieth - century event .
Technology and other circumstances have changed utterly over two thousand years .
But relative to what one can expect to find at that distant period , the records are reasonably full .
In the end the way I look at it is that life depends on making leaps of trust .
Think of getting married : you decide to trust a particular woman , though you cannot know that this is the right thing to do .
She could be unfaithful to you ; the only way to be sure she is not , I suppose , would be to get a private detective to check up on her – but if someone goes to those lengths , surely there is not much left of the marriage even if the detective finds nothing amiss ?
In practice , a happily married man has decided that his wife is someone who deserves his trust and fidelity , without worrying too much about amassing empirical evidence .
Perhaps that is a reasonable analogy for acceptance of Christianity .
It is true that there are many contradictions and unclarities in the New Testament .
But that does not imply that its central message is false .
It is a natural consequence of the fact that the events in question happened when they did – there were no cameras to record visual details or journalists to compile reliable verbatim reports .
( Indeed , if the four Gospels provided a more perfectly systematic and consistent account , that might lead us to suspect that the story was a cooked - up fiction . )
Norman England ( say ) is closer to our time than to Christ ’s , but , in order to work out the details of various important events under the Normans , historians regularly have to use skill in interpreting limited documentation .
For a couple of hundred years , initially mainly in Germany , people have been applying the normal standards of historical scholarship in order to untangle the surface inconsistencies and sporadic embroidering in the New Testament so as to produce a coherent account of the life , death , and resurrection of Jesus .
To my mind , what we have is an adequately convincing story .
( For a reliable summary of this work I recommend C.H. Dodd , The Founder of Christianity , 1973 . )
At various crucial points the Gospel story seems to me to have a telltale quality of authentic reportage rather than invented propaganda .
Consider for instance the Doubting Thomas story in chapter 20 of St John ’s Gospel , where one disciple who happened to be away when the resurrected Christ appeared to the others tells them that he wo n’t believe it , unless he can touch with his own hands the wounds where Jesus was nailed to the Cross .
Is this how a real human being might react in such circumstances ?
Surely yes .
Is it the kind of anecdote that fanatics cooking up a manifesto for an artificial ideology would choose to include ?
I would have said not .
Some will see it as paradoxical for a professional academic in particular to advocate Christianity , because they think of the Church , in centuries when it had more power than today , as having been an enemy of scientific progress .
But what people “ know ” about Church hostility to science is largely a set of urban myths , which people repeat to one another without knowing anything about the facts , like the myth that Eskimos have hundreds of words for snow .
( In reality the Eskimo language has no more words for snow than English has . )
To quote James Hannam ( God ’s Philosophers , 2009 , pp. 2–3 ) :
contrary to popular belief , the Church never supported the idea that the earth is flat , never banned human dissection , never banned zero and certainly never burnt anyone at the stake for scientific ideas .
In the 21st century the situation seems to be going into reverse .
Many people now talk as though a materialist world view which treats everything in the universe as explainable purely in terms of interactions of physical particles and forces , leaving no room for the possibility of God , were the only permissible outlook for respectable people to hold .
Dissent is not legally punishable , but it is certainly often taken as justifying dismissive scorn rather than a serious attempt to engage with an alternative point of view .
If things move much further in this direction , open adherence to Christianity will hobble professional careers by making the individual look unacceptably eccentric – perhaps that is already beginning to happen .
But this is mere intellectual authoritarianism , not a rational response to Mankind ’s current state of knowledge .
People who imagine that “ science has explained everything in physical terms ” need to understand that some of our deepest present - day thinkers would vigorously disagree .
David Chalmers , in The Conscious Mind ( 1996 ) , says that “ No explanation given wholly in physical terms can ever account for the emergence of conscious experience . ”
Thomas Nagel , in Mind and Cosmos ( 2012 ) , holds that Darwinian evolutionary processes cannot account for the existence of human minds and mental categories such as meaning and value .
Nagel recognizes that doubts about a mechanistic account of the origin of life “ will strike many people as outrageous , but that is because almost everyone in our secular culture has been browbeaten into regarding the reductive research program as sacrosanct , on the ground that anything else would not be science . ”
By any normal criteria of intellectual distinction , Chalmers and Nagel are among the most distinguished thinkers currently writing ( one in his forties , the other in his seventies ) , and it is clear to both that there is far more to human life than material science could ever tell us about ( though neither are setting out to shore up religious belief – as it happens , Nagel in particular is outspokenly irreligious ) .
A Christian who is told that his beliefs are “ unscientific ” should simply refuse to be browbeaten .
Still , even in the 21st century , Christians in the Western world face no sanctions beyond being cold - shouldered by influential bien-pensants .
They do n’t get burned at the stake ; whereas the torture and killing of heretics was no urban myth .
( Giordano Bruno was burned in Rome in 1600 for heresy – not for saying that the Earth goes round the Sun . )
Probably one of the largest factors turning people at the present day away from Christianity is awareness of the barbaric cruelties that have been practised in its name in the past .
In the town of Lewes near where I am writing , there is an annual festival commemorating the seventeen Protestants who were burned to death under the Catholic Queen Mary in 1555 – 7 – and although England , as a historically Protestant country , makes more noise about Protestants martyred by Catholics than vice versa , plenty of Catholics were just as horribly treated under Protestant monarchs .
Can an ideology which underlay such barbarism be worth our allegiance ?
If it happened nowadays , surely not .
But we have learned a great deal about ourselves over the past four centuries , in particular about the limitations to human knowledge and certainty .
Even physical science , which once seemed so solidly founded as to be totally unassailable , we now see ( following the twentieth - century philosopher of science Sir Karl Popper ) to be no more than a collection of not - yet - refuted conjectures .
Isaac Newton ’s account of gravity and other fundamental physical phenomena appeared to be definitively established for all time – until Albert Einstein came along and demonstrated that it was in fact mistaken .
If we can not be sure even about things like that , we certainly cannot be sure about arcane details of theology .
But no -one in the Middle Ages understood that yet .
They took for granted that it was possible to list out all the knowledge that matters for human life as straightforwardly as the multiplication tables .
And , unfortunately , one of the things they were quite sure of was that people ’s detailed stance towards religion during their lives on earth would determine whether they graduated after death to eternal bliss or spent eternity roasting in hell .
If you take that for granted , then you are going to see someone who deliberately spreads religious views which you count as heretical as even worse than a person who goes round deliberately spreading some horrible disease such as AIDS .
Instead of sentencing multitudes of decent folk to painful deaths , the heretic is sentencing them to eternal torment .
If you really believe that , then you might well feel justified in killing off the spreader of the virus in a way nasty enough to discourage imitators .
We are , rightly , more humble nowadays about the limits to human certainty – and once one appreciates that we cannot be sure even about science , let alone religion , then it becomes inconceivable to cite religion as a justification for barbaric punishments .
Humility about our human limitations is itself an attitude highly consistent with the Christian message .
But , tragically , it took us a very long time collectively to get our minds round that one .
All Christians today ( so far as I know ) understand very well that disagreement with others on points of religious doctrine cannot amount to justification for violence towards them .
It is deeply regrettable that the consequences of our earlier foolishness live on today in the shape of division between separate Christian denominations .
I have no patience , and I do not believe I ought to have patience , with many of the abstruse doctrinal differences which separate church from church .
Take for instance the Procession of the Holy Ghost – the picturesque name for the issue about the relationship between the Third Person of the Trinity and the other two Persons .
In the Church of England and other Western churches , we commonly assert our faith each week by reciting the Nicene Creed , which contains a sentence according to which the Holy Spirit “ proceeds from the Father and the Son ” .
The creed of the Eastern ( Greek and Russian Orthodox ) churches states that the Holy Spirit “ proceeds ” from God the Father alone .
As I understand it , the word filioque ( “ and from the Son ” ) was deliberately inserted into the Nicene Creed as a political move aimed at making the Eastern churches heterodox by Western standards .
How absurd !
Personally , I cannot claim to have a clear understanding of the Holy Spirit concept in the first place ; the suggestion that any human beings might claim to be so well - informed that they can decisively settle whether the Holy Spirit “ proceeds ” from both the other Persons or only from one is to me laughably arrogant .
And the same holds for many other doctrinal differences between the denominations .
( In compiling this web page I have learned that the Lutheran World Federation decided in 1990 that the filioque clause was not essential and should not be insisted on in interactions with Orthodox Christians .
Good for them .
The Anglican communion ought to follow suit . )
I believe we English are very fortunate to have the kind of national church we do .
The Church of England represents to my mind an admirable compromise between Roman Catholicism on one side and the Reformed churches on the other – eliminating the intellectual authoritarianism which one cannot deny to have been a significant feature of the former tradition , while retaining the ritual aspects of worship that nonconformist churches tend to reject , but which are emotionally important to many of us .
Nevertheless , although I personally am not tempted to switch denominational allegiance , I of course see committed Roman Catholics , Methodists , etc. as true Christians as much as my own pew -mates .
Pope Benedict XVI strikes me as a quite excellent Christian leader .
[ Added in 2013 : now ex-Pope .
His successor may be fine too , it is too early for me to judge . ]
To treat the unfortunate schisms between denominations as a ground for rejecting Christianity in general is not intelligent .
I said that I feel fortunate in having been born into a society with a congenial national church ; and I realize that another line sceptics might take is to say “ It ’s all just luck – he happened to be born into a Christian background so he accepts that , others happened to be born into other religious backgrounds , or into none , and they acquire their respective religious commitments or lack thereof accordingly – one should not mistake accidents of one ’s parentage for insight into ultimate truth ” .
I agree , and I do not believe that I make that mistake .
As it happens , my own parents were not churchgoers ; I found my own way to church in my early teens , there was no nudging and no - one went with me .
It is true that I was living in a Christian country and attending schools which formally acknowledged the authority of Christianity , as ( certainly at that period ) most English schools did .
On the other hand , even in the 1950s there was no shortage of people in my environment who rejected Christianity or were simply indifferent to religion , and there was no kind of pressure on me which might have discouraged me from joining them .
In my late teens and twenties I did give up religion for a while ; but I went back to it later .
But that ( the sceptic may say ) relates to the choice between religion and no religion , which may well be more to do with the individual ’s choices than with the lottery of birth .
The accident - of - birth argument , though , is really about choice of one religion over another religion .
Surely I have to admit that it is because I happen to be English that I am a Christian rather than an adherent of another religion ?
Part of my answer to that would be that from what I have learned , it is misleading to think of “ religion ” as a single universal category of which each corner of the world has its own example (s ) .
In Europe , we know mainly about three “ religions ” : Christianity , Judaism , and Islam .
These are in a sense different examples of a single category : each is a body of doctrine which relates to an all - powerful supernatural Being , and which makes exclusivity claims – rather like joining a political party , giving your allegiance to any one of the three is incompatible with adherence to either of the other two .
But when one looks further afield , the systems which we in England classify as religions are not necessarily like that at all .
I am impressed by what I understand of Buddhism , at least in its original , “ Hinayana ” form – I have not myself tried to adopt it as a way of life , but I believe it might be a good one .
However , so far as I am aware one could perfectly sincerely be both a Buddhist and a Christian : to treat the two as incompatible would be like saying that someone cannot be a chamber - music enthusiast at the same time as being a member of the Conservative Party .
The things are not opposed but at right - angles to one another .
( Buddhism does not teach about a God at all , so it certainly does not enjoin belief in a non-Christian God . )
I do not know enough about Hinduism or the other religions of India to pursue this discussion with reference to them .
But if someone says that there is no better reason than accidents of birth for people to give their allegiance to Christianity rather than to another religion , in practice for a European this means : rather than to Judaism or Islam ; and I believe there are good reasons for preferring Christianity .
Christianity inculcates behaviour patterns which make for a more humane society , if enough members of society strive to adopt them .
Christianity is a development of Judaism ; Jesus was a Jew , and he told us “ Do not suppose that I have come to abolish the Law and the prophets ; I did not come to abolish , but to complete ” ( Matthew 5.17 ) : we are entitled to take over anything worthwhile in Judaism into Christianity .
Personally , I think it is a pity that Christians do not practice some of the Jewish observances that take place within the family circle ; that religion has a very positive effect in terms of supporting and strengthening family life .
I am less convinced that distinctively Jewish rather than Christian beliefs and observances achieve much for the public life of society as a whole , but for most of us the point is irrelevant – Judaism is not on the menu , because it is the possession of a particular ethnic group , and does not put itself forward as an option available to humanity in general .
As for Islam , at the present point in history it is scarcely controversial to say that apologists for that religion have quite a job on their hands to convince the rest of us that their religion is even compatible with life in a civilized society .
( George Pell , R.C. Archbishop of Sydney , commented in 2006 that he had tried reading the Koran and noting down the passages where it advocates violence ; “ There are so many of them , however , that I abandoned this exercise after 50 or 60 or 70 pages ” . )
Some would like to revive the pagan religion followed by our forefathers before Christianity .
Most people who talk that way are naïve types with vague ideas about being at one with Nature , who would run a mile from paganism as it was actually practised in England ( which seems to have involved a great deal of human sacrifice , gang rape , and so forth ) .
But there are Continental intellectuals such as Alain de Benoist who argue in all seriousness that Europe needs to return to its pagan roots .
There are many answers to this .
One is that we do n’t really know much in detail about what pre-Christian European religions were like : what force can there be in an argument for an unknown ?
Also , what we do know about the paganism of our own Germanic forebears suggests that it was sometimes shallowly derivative .
What is the story of Odin hanging nine nights on a tree , as “ an offering to Odin , myself to myself ” ( Kevin Crossley - Holland ’s translation ) , but a childish aping of the Crucifixion story ?
And third , the little we do know about Germanic paganism makes it sound pretty obnoxious .
De Benoist himself says , approvingly , that it means treating power rather than justice as a supreme value .
He writes as though the only thing holding us back from quitting our churches in favour of pagan sacred groves is lack of awareness that there was religion before Christianity ; in fact many of us are well aware of this , but as decent and intelligent people we are glad to have moved away from that religion .
( In fairness I would add that these criticisms of Germanic paganism might not apply to the rather different religion of the ancient Greeks .
But with that , we English lack the blood - ties which de Benoist seems to see as important . )
Realistically , for most of us the choice is between Christianity and irreligion .
I choose Christianity .
I believe that England , and the world , would be better places if more people did so ; and I believe that this is an intelligent , well - founded judgement .
British diffidence is a good thing , at periods when the foundations of our civilization are not seriously threatened .
At present they are .
So we ought to be worrying less about being Britishly unassertive , and more about actively defending what is good in our inheritance .

The bulk of the above essay dates from about ten years ago .
Re-reading it now , there is one respect in which I would modify the views I expressed .
I described the Church of England as a particularly congenial Christian church , and for most of my life it has been .
But under its current Archbishop of Canterbury , Justin Welby , it has been behaving in a way that makes it difficult to continue in membership – an issue I discuss on another webpage .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Supreme Court justices on Tuesday expressed skepticism about the Obama administration ’s argument that the U.S. Congress can keep sex offenders in custody for an indefinite time beyond their prison sentences .
Solicitor General Elena Kagan , the administration ’s top courtroom lawyer , urged the justices to uphold a 2006 federal law providing for the continued detention of sexually dangerous federal inmates who have completed their prison terms .
Chief Justice John Roberts asked Kagan why the federal government ’s authority in such cases does not end when the prisoner ’s sentence is done .
The Supreme Court in 1997 ruled that U.S. states could confine dangerous sex offenders to mental institutions after they serve their sentences .
The issue on Tuesday was whether the federal government also had that authority .
Politicians from both U.S. political parties have backed tougher measures to deal with sex offenders in the U.S. criminal justice system to try to make sure they do not commit repeat crimes .
Crime has been a major issue in U.S. politics and many elected officials are sensitive to any accusations from opponents that they are too lenient on violent convicts .
There has been ongoing public concern over repeat sexual offenders .
‘ TAKING OVER EVERYTHING ’
Of the nine Supreme Court members , conservative Justice Antonin Scalia appeared the most troubled by the law .
Scalia told Kagan he was unimpressed by her argument that the federal government had to step in because some states might not confine prisoners who pose a danger .
“ This is a recipe for the federal government taking over everything , ” Scalia said .
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that under the government ’s theory , any dangerous person could be held indefinitely .
A U.S. appeals court struck down the law for exceeding the limits of congressional authority and for intruding on police powers the U.S. Constitution reserves for the states , many of which have their own similar laws .
The law had been challenged by five inmates who had been kept in custody at a federal prison hospital in North Carolina after their sentences ended .
The federal law defined “ sexually dangerous ” as someone who suffered from a serious mental illness , abnormality or disorder and would have difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released .
Kagan defended the law .
Of approximately 15,000 federal prisoners who have engaged in sexually violent acts or child molestation , the government has identified only about 100 inmates for detention after serving their sentence , she said .
Kagan ended her argument by saying that Congress took the reasonable step of making sure the federal government can continue to hold a sexually dangerous , mentally ill prisoner when the state would not act .
G. Alan DuBois , an assistant federal public defender in North Carolina , argued that the law should be struck down and said the government ’s power to hold someone ended once the prison sentence has been served .
A decision in the case is expected by the end of June .
It does n't take much to figure out men .
One thing I know is that for the most part , straight men a ) like Beer b ) like big , filling meals and c ) if they ever were to become clothing designers , hem lines would be permanently raised and tops low cut .
I call this stew the Marriage Maker and its existence preceded Masterchef although it was the beer and meat cooking Chris that reminded me of how good it was .
It 's also easy enough , tastes delicious and filling but unfortunately is not the most photogenic of foods .
Call it the antithesis of a picture perfect and dainty High Tea ( and a straight man 's worst nightmare ) .
I was lucky enough to receive a carton of beer from the Blue Tongue Brewery .
In it I received four six packs of beer : a Premium Lager , a Lite Beer , a Pilsener and curiously , an alcoholic Ginger Beer .
I was delighted to see such a generous package but my reaction was n't anywhere near as excited as my husband .
Yes , when men come home tired and a tad grumpy , showing them a carton of this beer will make them very , very happy .
Although that 's pretty logical really .
If I had to describe it as something , I 'd say the stew resembles a meat pie filling .
Not your cheap and nasty pies with mince and gristle and random bits of human finger but a gourmet pie with chunky , succulently tender pieces of beer with a richness from the beer .
You can certainly taste that it 's there although it is n't as strong as say a Beef Bourguignon .
I know calling it a Marriage Maker is risky .
After all I cannot offer anything to substantiate these claims .
And it 's true I 'm no expert on marriage being married for only 3 years .
I have been proposed to more than once and most of the proposals were after I had fed someone ( oh the bruised ego that it was n't for my brains , looks or charm ) .
Perhaps it 's a culinary version of Beer Goggles .
So tell me Dear Reader , what tricks do you have up your sleeve to entice the opposite sex ?
Beef & Beer Stew with Cheese Dumplings aka The Marriage Maker
And Original Recipe by Not Quite Nigella
1kg /2.2 pounds beef cut into 1 inch / walnut sized pieces
2 - 3 tablespoons of oil
3 large onions , sliced
150g / 5ozs bacon
3 tablespoons flour
2 cups beef stock
1x 345ml/12 fl ozs bottle of beer ( I used Blue Tongue Brewery Pilsener )
3 - 4 bay leaves
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
For the dumplings
100g /3.5ozs self raising flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
50 grams / 1.7ozs butter melted
1 egg
50 grams / 1.7ozs grated cheese
Sauteeing the onions and bacon
After cooking for about 15 minutes
Step 1 - Prepare stew .
Pat beef pieces dry with a couple of paper towels and heat a large frying pan or cast iron pot .
Add oil and brown beef in 3 batches and set aside in a bowl .
Then fry onion and snip in bacon into the pot with a pair of scissors and cook until onions are translucent and bacon is lightly cooked .
Add flour and cook for 2 - 3 minutes making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan as if you do n't , it will stick and become a terrible pain to clean .
Add the stock , beer , bay leaves , sugar and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil , then turn it down to low to avoid it sticking and catching on the bottom and place lid on top leaving a small 1 cm gap .
Stir occassionally and cook until beef is tender ( 1 to 1 1/2 hours ) .
Dumpling mix
Dumplings just placed in the stew
Step 2 - Fifteen minutes before the stew has finished cooking , make the dumplings .
In a small bowl , mix together the flour and baking powder .
In a measuring jug , mix the butter , egg and cheese with a fork .
Add the wet mix to the flour and using a spoon , stir to combine .
You may need 1 or 2 tablespoons of water to help it come together .
Roll into 8 balls with your hands and place on top of the stew .
I keep the lid on while I am making it so that the stew heats up even more and then once the dumplings are made , just put them in and replace with the lid .
Turn the heat up to medium so that the dough has a chance to rise .
Cook for 15 minutes .

( CNN ) --
When Dan Brown 's blockbuster novel " The Lost Symbol " hit stores in September , it may have offered a peek at the future of bookselling .
On Amazon.com , the book sold more digital copies for the Kindle e-reader in its first few days than hardback editions .
This was seen as something of a paradigm shift in the publishing industry , but it also may have come at a cost .
Less than 24 hours after its release , pirated digital copies of the novel were found on file - sharing sites such as Rapidshare and BitTorrent .
Within days , it had been downloaded for free more than 100,000 times .
Digital piracy , long confined to music and movies , is spreading to books .
And as electronic reading devices such as Amazon 's Kindle , the Sony Reader , Barnes & Noble 's Nook , smartphones and Apple 's much - anticipated " tablet " boost demand for e-books , experts say the problem may only get worse .
" It 's fair to say that piracy of e-books is exploding , " said Albert Greco , an industry expert and professor of marketing at Fordham University .
Sales for digital books in the second quarter of 2009 totaled almost $ 37 million .
That 's more than three times the total for the same three months in 2008 , according to the Association of American Publishers ( AAP ) .
Statistics are hard to come by , and many publishers are reluctant to discuss the subject for fear of encouraging more illegal downloads .
But digital theft may pose a big headache in 2010 for the slumping publishing industry , which relies increasingly on electronic reading devices and e-books to stimulate sales .
" Piracy is a serious issue for publishers , " said Hachette Book Group in a statement .
The company that publishes Stephenie Meyer 's wildly popular " Twilight " teen - vampire series says it " considers copyright protection to be of paramount importance . "
Authors are concerned as well .
" I 'd be really worried if I were Stephen King or James Patterson or a really big bestseller that when their books become completely digitized , how easy it 's going to be to pirate them , " said novelist and poet Sherman Alexie on Stephen Colbert 's show last month .
" With the open - source culture on the Internet , the idea of ownership -- of artistic ownership -- goes away , " Alexie added .
" It terrifies me . "
And it 's not just bestsellers that are targeted by thieves .
" Textbooks are frequently pirated , but so are many other categories , " said Ed McCoyd , director of digital policy at AAP .
" We see piracy of professional content , such as medical books and technical guides ; we see a lot of general fiction and non-fiction .
So it really runs the gamut . "
Piracy of digital music , thanks to Napster and other file - sharing sites , has been a threat to recording companies for more than a decade .
Over the years , the record companies tried different approaches to combat illegal downloading , from shutting down Web sites to encrypting songs with digital - rights management software to suing individual file - sharers .
Although illegal file - sharing of music persists , Apple 's online iTunes store is now the world 's biggest seller of music .
To some industry observers , this may be where the future of the book industry is heading as well .
But talk to publishers and authors about what can be done to combat e-book piracy , and you 'll get a wide range of opinions .
Some publishers may try to minimize theft by delaying releases of e-books for several weeks after physical copies go on sale .
Simon & Schuster recently did just that with Stephen King 's novel , " Under the Dome , " although the publisher says the decision was made to prevent cheaper e-versions from cannibalizing hardcover sales .
Some authors have even gone as far as to shrug off e-book technology altogether .
J.K
Rowling has thus far refused to make any of her Harry Potter books available digitally because of piracy fears and a desire to see readers experience her books in print .
However , some evidence suggests that authors ' and publishers ' claims of damage from illegal piracy may be overstated .
Recent statistics have shown that consumers who purchase an e-reader buy more books than those who stick with traditional bound volumes .
Amazon reports that Kindle owners buy , on average , 3.1 times as many books on the site as other customers .
Ana Maria Allessi , publisher for Harper Media at HarperCollins , told CNN , " we have to be vigilant in our punishment ... but much more attractive is to simply make the technology better , legally . "
E - book technology offers so many positives for both the author and the consumer that any revenue lost to piracy may just be a necessary evil , she said .
" Consumers who invest in one of these dedicated e-book readers tend to load it up and read more , " said Allessi .
" And what 's wrong with that ? "
CNN.com 's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story .
There are those who return to Jack Kerouac just to get lost in the ride .
Not across lonesome America but in the serpentine locomotion of his prose .
It ’s the music of the page : long blasts of blue - streak narrative that do n’t yield to periods , semicolons , commas ; mile - long sentences that twist onto side - road tangents before -- in their best moments -- leading to a clear , untrammeled epiphany .
Kerouac ’s ear was tuned to a different set of rules : that herky - jerk flow , the misplaced modifier mining something different , something else .
The “ not writing ” but “ typing ” for which Truman Capote famously wrist - rapped Kerouac had its own incantatory power .
His switchback sentences , when read aloud , required a horn player ’s circular breathing prowess : the correct embouchure .
Not surprisingly , in the five decades since his novel “ On the Road ” entered our vernacular , scores of musicians have been drawn to his body of work , finding some way to sit in , staking out a space within the prose .
Plush Hollywood composer - arrangers , jazz singers , art rockers , post - punkers , conscious MCs have all attempted to interpret the mood , the motion , the after - effect .
“ One Fast Move or I ’m Gone : Kerouac ’s Big Sur ” ( F - Stop / Atlantic Records : deluxe version , $ 59.98 ) is another one on the pile .
Out this fall for the 40th anniversary of Kerouac ’s death , the compilation -- a 2007 documentary and its soundtrack -- comes handsomely packaged as a worn , hardcover book .
But the cover opens to reveal a cavity .
In it are two disc sleeves -- a CD and DVD -- along with a copy of the Penguin paperback of “ Big Sur ” as well as a slim booklet filled with production / liner notes and never - before - seen photos of a wary - looking Kerouac .
Slipped in , as if an afterthought , is a folded sheet of manuscript ( a previously unpublished page from “ Reflections on Big Sur , ” 1963 ) that looks as if it were just dashed off , typewriter on newsprint .
The CD “ One Fast Move or I ’m Gone ” features a dozen songs composed and performed by indie rockers Jay Farrar of Son Volt and Benjamin Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie .
The 150 - minute film of the same name , directed by Curt Worden and produced by Kerouac ’s nephew , Jim Sampas , along with Gloria Bailen , is an eccentric mélange of talking - head documentary , music video and line - reading / reenactment , featuring poets , ex-lovers , agents , biographers and , of course , musicians : Tom Waits ( a longtime admirer and interpreter of Kerouac ’s prose ) , Patti Smith , the Grateful Dead ’s Robert Hunter .
Worden ’s portal opens sometime way - back mid-last century , with black - and - white footage of Kerouac , Allen Ginsberg and a crew of writers , thinkers and talkers floating through the East Village , as actor John Ventimiglia , eerily , note - perfectly channels Kerouac ’s New England cadences .
After this gorgeous time - capsule moment , the documentary wanders a well - worn path : Kerouac ’s meteoric rise and difficult , often self - steered descent .
While Worden tries to use “ visual imagery as a simple backdrop letting the prose take center stage , ” Gibbard and Farrar set themselves up with the trickier mission .
How does one convey a man ’s unraveling through music without edging toward the cliché ?
“ Big Sur ” is a bleak and beautiful book .
It ’s one of Kerouac ’s best in that he records not only the ravages of depression , alcohol , vulnerability and mania but also , in an almost agonizing stop- motion , offers a long documentary take on what it ’s like to cycle through it all again and again .
Published in 1962 , it is the flip side to the enormous and dislocating success of “ On the Road ” -- a road novel , yes , but in an altogether different sense .
If “ On the Road ” is about igniting the soul , “ Big Sur ” is about the moment when the road runs out .
By 1960 , when the book takes place , Kerouac ’s life had been upended , both by outer forces and his persistent inner-demons . " [ S ] ince the publication of ‘ Road ’ I ’ve been driven mad for three years by endless telegrams , phone calls , requests , mail , visitors , reporters , snoopers , ” he writes in “ Big Sur ’s ” early pages .
“ Teenagers jumped the six - foot fence I had built around my yard for privacy .
. . .
Drunken visitors puking in my study , stealing books and even pencils .
. . .
Me drunk practically all of the time to put on a jovial cap to keep up with all of this but finally realizing I was surrounded and outnumbered . . . . ”
It ’s a particularly affecting horror story because it shadows the tight - wire path we walk every day : a man , slowly , inexorably closing down on himself .
It ’s Kerouac ’s “ The Crack - Up . ” Like F. Scott Fitzgerald did in his account of a disintegration into paranoia ( also fueled by alcohol ) , he is not simply writing but whispering in your ear .
The novel opens at the center of a hangover .
Already beat , Jack Duluoz ( Kerouac ’s alter ego ) has slipped into San Francisco with a plan to avoid his usual circle of cronies and carousing .
The idea is to escape to the quiet of the Big Sur cabin owned by friend and poet Lorenz Monsanto ( a.k.a. Lawrence Ferlinghetti ) , to be “ alone and undisturbed for six weeks just chopping wood , drawing water , writing , sleeping , hiking etc. , etc . ”
But in a matter of hours , it ’s off : " [ I ] nstead , I ’ve bounded drunk into . . .
City Lights book shop at the height of Saturday business . . . and ‘t ’all ends up a roaring drunk in all the famous bars the bloody ‘ King of the Beatniks ’ is back in town buying drinks for everyone . ”
What does paranoia sound like ?
Madness ?
“ Big Sur ” is a cold , dank basement of a book , the long digression of a man wavering between depression and desperation but still seeking -- sometimes glimpsing hope ’s light , a weak sun passing through the Northern California coastal fog .
How does one interpret someone ’s “ coming undone ” without straining , without relying on pat convention ?
Especially when Kerouac articulates it so well for himself , in the ache of these lines :
“ I can hear myself again whining ‘ Why does God torture me ? ’ --
But anybody who ’s never had delirium tremens even in their early stages may not understand that it ’s not so much a physical pain but a mental anguish indescribable to those ignorant people who do n’t drink and accuse drinkers of irresponsibility --
The mental anguish is so intense that you feel you have betrayed your very birth .
. . .
You feel guilt so deep you identify yourself with the devil and God seems far away abandoning you to your sick silliness --
You feel sick in the greatest sense of the word , breathing without believing in it sicksicksick , your soul groans .
. . . ”
Like so many projects , “ One Fast Move or I ’m Gone ” does much casting about for the whys .
It ’s in this exercise that one begins to understand how long Kerouac has been gone .
The onscreen questions do n’t change so much , but that ’s not true of the people who gather around those nicked wooden tables at Vesuvio ’s or Caffe Trieste in North Beach .
They have “ conversations ” set up meticulously in places where Kerouac walked , slept , caroused , copulated and sometimes attempted to write .
All this , quite poignantly , points up who ’s gone .
With the exception of people such as Ferlinghetti , Kerouac ’s agent Sterling Lord , writer and ex-lover Joyce Johnson or Carolyn Cassady , widow of Kerouac ’s madman archetype , Neal Cassady , the storytellers now recycle memories of other memories , like third - generation photocopies , beginning to get fuzzy , indistinct .
Songwriters Gibbard and Farrar go through this process in music rather than in words , channeling an attempt to approximate mood .
Still , for all its earnestness , there ’s something discordant .
The tracks seem self - effacing enough , a sad voice against a simply strummed guitar , a wail of a pedal steel .
But ultimately , this is someone else ’s take on someone else ’s story -- instead of that raw expression you get handwritten in a leather - bound journal .
One wonders at the choices .
Though the filmmakers have fit in a bebop track or two , it feels like a mere brush stroke of verisimilitude .
Most of Kerouac ’s books -- the poems , the novels , the day books and essays -- burst with jazz .
“ Big Sur ” does n’t stray from that motif .
We get “ booming loud Stan Getz jazz on the Hi-Fi , ” Sinatra and Chet Baker in the wings .
So in a certain way it ’s courageous for Gibbard and Farrar to imagine a score that diverges from the expected , to try to fit Kerouac into today ’s outsider vernacular .
Yet such a decision raises a larger question :
Why did jazz suit Kerouac ?
Jazz is spirit music , Nat Hentoff once wrote .
And so much of Kerouac ’s life was predicated on his search for ecstatic experience , writer Brenda Knight notes early in the documentary .
Robert Hunter , lyricist for the Grateful Dead , extends the thought :
" [ A ]s long is Jack is running Jack is going to live .
And as long as Jack is living Jack is going to write .
And we benefit from that hangover , those of us who love this book .
This is an ugly , ugly book .
Of ugly places of the mind , places in the psyche and Jack has to wring himself out . . . he has to do it . ”
Kerouac wrote in the language of jazz -- its nouns , verbs , its cadences .
He cleared out space sometimes to make the reader look at this improvisation , this solo , before he continued on with his story .
Indeed , Kerouac wanted to be considered a “ jazz poet blowing a long blues in a afternoon jazz session / on a Sunday . ”
His dissolution too -- at the very least , it seems -- would always feel more like a blazing bebop horn .
“ Big Sur ” is a book about a descent , a life and death battle , “ One fast move or I ’m gone . . . . ”
It is sobering to know that Kerouac had only seven more years left after he published this novel , although clearly he already had a sense of that himself .
Without his frankness , his dogged search , his drive to go deep inside , we would n’t have this document .
Which is why there is something bracing about revisiting this text at this moment , when so many are deep in the canyon thinking :
What next ?
If you look at “ One Fast Move ” as an extrapolation , you start to see how the next puzzle piece fits : Kerouac has , for decades now , been a voice for those looking to convey one of life ’s inescapable amalgams : a hormonal / chemical combination of joy , kicks and despair .
It ’s a passed - down story , speaking across 40 years ; another generation ’s take .
Gibbard gets it right in the documentary , sitting on what looks like the deck at Nepenthe , nudged back off the curves of Highway 1 along one of those gorgeous / deadly Big Sur drops .
“ Every place he goes , ” he says , earnest eyes wide behind thick plastic frames , voice without a note of irony , “ there ’s just this barrage of young people who want to buy him drinks , want to take a piece of him with them .
Even though he ’s already given them the most important part of his life -- which are these books . ”

When Jeff Bridges sat down for an interview with Entertainment Weekly to discuss his new film , Crazy Heart , the EW people just had to ask Bridges about his most iconic role – that of “ the Dude ” in The Big Lebowski .
Full disclosure : I love The Big Lebowski , and hearing Jeff Bridges talk about the film made me geek out like the dorkiest fangirl you ’ve ever seen .
Not only is Jeff Bridges talking about the film ( The Dude on The Dude ) , what he says just struck me as hysterical :
A couple of weeks ago , we found ourselves sitting face to face with His Dudeness , Jeff Bridges , to talk about his excellent new movie , Crazy Heart .
But since we were in the presence of everyone ’s favorite stoned , strike - rolling cult hero , we had to ask about the 1998 Coen brothers classic , The Big Lebowski .
Specifically , we asked Bridges what he does when he ’s sitting at home in Santa Barbara , chilling , watching TV ( with , one hopes , a White Russian in hand ) and The Big Lebowski comes on .
Does he turn the channel ?
Watch the movie from beginning to end ?
Stick around to see a particular scene ?
Here ’s what Bridges had to say …
“ The only movie that I ’ll catch and watch all the way through is The Godfather .
That hooks me in every time .
I ’ve seen that several times thinking I ’m going to change the channel .
With Lebowski , usually I ’ll say , ‘ Oh , I ’ll just wait until Turturro licks the ball , then I ’ll change it . ’
And then he licks the ball , and I ’ll keep watching . ”
[ From Entertainment Weekly ]
“ I ’ll just wait until Turturro licks the ball ” is the best sentence ever .
Best sentence of the year , really .
Anyway , Jeff Bridges is receiving a ton of critical praise for Crazy Heart , in which Bridges plays a down - on - his - luck alcoholic country singer still searching for a break .
The film costars Colin Farrell ( who asked to have his name taken off the credits out of respect for Jeff Bridges ’ performance ) , Maggie Gyllenhaal and Robert Duvall .
Jeff has already been nominated for some of the big awards this year – he ’s got a Golden Globe nomination for Lead Actor Drama , as well as a Broadcast Film Critics nomination , Independent Spirit Award nomination , a Screen Actors Guild nomination , and he picked up the LA Critics award for Best Actor .
Many people have Bridges pegged for an Oscar nomination , which , if it happens , would be his fifth career nomination with no wins .
In my mind , Bridges is one of the most underrated actors working today – and it ’s a travesty he ’s never won an Oscar .
If he gets nominated , he might be this year ’s choice for “ getting the Oscar because it ’s his turn . ”
Bridges ’ biggest competition in the category could be George Clooney ( Up In The Air ) , Morgan Freeman ( Invictus ) and Colin Firth ( for A Single Man , and Colin could also get some “ it ’s his turn ” votes ) .
Bridges has been doing a lot of interviews , and he basically seems like one of the most decent , professional , kindest , most interesting actors you ’d ever want to meet .
If I ever met Jeff Bridges , I would fall at his feet and beg him to touch my head .
Anyway , here ’s part of one of the better interviews I ’ve read with Bridges :
Q : T Bone Burnett ( musician , producer ) says this started on the set of “ Heaven ’s Gate , ” 30 years ago .
A : That ’s true .
That ’s where T Bone and I met , as well as Stephen Bruton , who ’s an old friend of T Bone’s .
I also met ( Kris ) Kristofferson , who was a role model for this character .
And he brought all of his musician friends to “ Heaven ’s Gate , ” so that was six months of jamming with these guys every night after work .
All of those years between then and now , we kept our friendship up .
When this script came across my path initially , I turned it down , because while the script was fine , there was no music attached to it , so it was missing an essential piece .
And then I ran into T Bone somewhere , and he was saying , “ Did you ever hear about this script ‘ Crazy Heart ’ ? ”
And I said , “ Yeah , why , are you interested in doing it ? ”
And he said , “ I ’ll do it if you do it . ”
And I said , “ I ’ll do it if you do it . ”
So then the missing piece appeared .
Q : You had to set aside your own performance style to play the character .
A : What I do for any role is I look inside myself , think about aspects of myself that I must use .
I ’ve written country tunes and I like to sing , those kinds of things , so I used that .
But you ’re right , Bad does n’t perform exactly like me , so I look to other role models like Kris and Waylon ( Jennings ) .
My biggest role model was Stephen Bruton , who the film was dedicated to and who died shortly after the film was completed .
He was with me every step of the way , giving me instructions on how to play the guitar , how to perform , and also what it ’s like to lead that kind of life .
Bad ’s life parallels Stephen ’s own life .
He would drive himself to gigs , and he had problems with booze and substances and all that , so he was a wonderful touchstone for me .
Q : The performance is pretty vanity free .
You ’re not too concerned about how you look .
A : There ’s a certain amount of vanity in that .
Vanity is caring how you appear .
That caring manifests itself in looking bad .
That would be the most effective way of making that character look good .
See what I mean ?
Q : It took me awhile to realize your character is half in the bag the whole film .
Other actors would have been a little more showy about being loaded .
A : Guys who drink so often are pretty good at it .
It ’s not a matter of knowing .
They ’re like that all the time .
They ’re used to being that way , and it ’s no big deal .
Q : And the Oscar talk .
What is your attitude toward that ?
A : To be getting the “ Attaboy ! ” is a wonderful feeling .
And also another aspect of it is bringing attention to this movie that I ’m very proud of .
Q : I was looking at a list of films you supposedly turned down , like Indiana Jones .
These are films you were offered and decided it was a direction you did n’t want to take ?
A : Yeah , I ’ve heard that .
It must be on the Internet .
I do n’t remember turning any of those things down .
Q : The upside of that is that you ’ve had a longer career than someone who had done those kinds of roles .
A : Yeah .
One of the things I learned from my father ( Lloyd Bridges ) just from observing the frustration that he got from developing a strong persona from a TV show ( “ Sea Hunt ” ) , he pulled that off so well that people thought he was a skin diver .
He only got scripts for skin divers .
He was a classically trained actor , a very versatile guy .
That ’s something I really worked for , not to develop a persona , for a couple of reasons .
One , it keeps it interesting for me .
And hopefully it ’s easier for the audience to project a character on me without bringing the last time they saw me .
And also for filmmakers , that I can play all kinds of parts .
[ From The San Francisco Chronicle ]
See ?
He just seems like a really nice man .
He makes and keep friends for decades , he works when he wants , he cares about the work , and he does n’t treat people like crap .
Love him !
By the way , just for The Big Lebowski fangirls and fanboys out there , The New York Times just ran an excellent piece on the cultural impact the film has had for the past decade – it ’s a really interesting , funny read , and I would recommend it .
WASHINGTON 
As terrorist plots against the United States have piled up in recent months , politicians and the news media have sounded the alarm with a riveting message for Americans :
Be afraid .
Al Qaeda is on the march again , targeting the country from within and without , and your hapless government cannot protect you .
But the politically charged clamor has lumped together disparate cases and obscured the fact that the enemies on American soil in 2009 , rather than a single powerful and sophisticated juggernaut , were a scattered , uncoordinated group of amateurs who displayed more fervor than skill .
The weapons were old - fashioned guns and explosives  in several cases , duds supplied by F.B.I. informants  with no trace of the biological or radiological poisons , let alone the nuclear bombs , that have long been the ultimate fear .
And though 2009 brought more domestic plots , and more serious plots , than any recent year , their lethality was relatively modest .
Exactly 14 of the approximately 14,000 murders in the United States last year resulted from allegedly jihadist attacks : 13 people shot at Fort Hood in Texas in November and one at a military recruiting station in Little Rock , Ark. , in June .
Such statistics would be no comfort , of course , if an attack with mass casualties succeeded some day .
This year is the 60th anniversary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) .
Howard Zinn wrote about SNCC ’s participation at the 1963 March on Washington .
“ … the youngest speaker on the platform , John Lewis … lashed out in anger , not only at the Dixiecrats , but at the Kennedy Administration , which had been successful up to that moment in directing the indignation of 200,000 people at everyone but itself . ”

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : hakyll - 1.0
Hello , I have just released hakyll [ 1 ] 1.0 .
It is now available on hackage [ 2 ] .
This is considered a first stable release ( hence 1.0 ) , and pretty it is functional .
Hakyll is a Haskell library for generating static sites .
It is written in a very configurable way and uses an xmonad - like DSL for configuration .
Important changes : - Switched from the template library to a custom template system , because we needed some more flexibility , but not quite as much as something like HStringTemplate would give .
- Switched from inconsistent String / ByteString usage to String only for the external API .
- Added a $ root system so it is easy to work with relative / absolute URL's .
- Many bugfixes . - More documentation and a reference are online now .
All feedback and questions are welcome .
Kind regards , Jasper Van der Jeugt [ 1 ] : http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll [ 2 ] :

Somali hijackers released a Greek - owned tanker and its 28 - member crew in the Indian Ocean on Monday , after collecting a large ransom — and finding themselves in a gun battle with another band of pirates seeking to claim a share .
The Greek - owned tanker Maran Centaurus , laden with two million barrels of Saudi Arabian crude oil valued at about $ 156 million , had been held by the pirates since late November .

Also prominent on the new home page is a feature called “ Plan & Ride , ” which lets users find door - to - door directions across several modes of transportation .
The feature is similar to HopStop.com and the authority ’s own TripPlanner application , although entering a search sends users directly to a Google Maps page .
Image Real - time updates on delays will be among the information featured prominently on the site .

“ When you open up a Web site , you say , ‘ Where do I want to go ? ’ ” Mr. Walder said .
“ You could not find an airline or a car rental company or anything like that that does n’t have the what - do - you - want - to - do feature right at the front of their page . ”
The authority already licenses its scheduling data to Google , and Mr. Walder said that it made more financial sense to take advantage of an already popular outside service rather than to continue investing in a proprietary application .
The new site will also make it easier for outside software designers to get free access to system timetables and routes .
Except for Amtrak , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority receives more Web traffic than any other public transit agency in the country .
At its peak , in November 2008 , the authority ’s Web site had more than 1.8 million unique visitors and about 25 million page views , according to data compiled by the Nielsen Company .
In November 2009 , the site had about 1.1 million visitors , more than Greyhound or Avis .
Not all of the site ’s 9,000 pages will be updated when the new version goes online .
Officials described the new site as a work in progress , and mobile tie-ins for the BlackBerry and the iPhone are in development .
Web designers who were asked to compare both versions of the site said that the overhaul was an improvement , but that the authority still had a ways to go .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Political turmoil , a brain drain of scientists and waning interest have transformed Russia from a nation that launched the first satellite into an increasingly minor player in the world of science , according to a Thomson Reuters report released on Tuesday .

An analysis of research papers published by Russian scientists shows an almost across - the - board decrease , which reflects Russia ’s shrinking influence not only in science but in science - based industries such as nuclear power , the authors of the Thomson Reuters report said .
“ Russia ’s research base has a problem , and it shows little sign of a solution , ” the report reads .
“ Russia has been a leader in scientific research and intellectual thinking across Europe and the world for so long that it comes not only as a surprise but a shock to see that it has a small and dwindling share of world activity as well as real attrition of its core strengths . ”
In October , more than 170 expatriate Russian scientists signed a letter to President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , complaining about “ the catastrophic conditions of fundamental science . ”
“ While other countries have increased their research output , Russia has struggled to maintain its output and even slipped backwards in areas like physics and space science , historically its core strengths , ” said Jonathan Adams , director of research evaluation at Thomson Reuters , parent company of Reuters .
More information on the research is availablehere .
Adams and colleagues use a Thomson Reuters database to track scientific publications .
FALLING BEHIND
Russian research accounts for about 2.6 percent of the world ’s papers published in journals indexed by Thomson Reuters over five years , the report found .
“ For comparison , this is more than Brazil ( 102,000 papers , 2.1 percent of world ) but less than India ( 144,000 papers , 2.9 percent ) and far less than China ( 415,000 papers , 8.4 percent ) . ”
The main focus was on physics and chemistry , with little research in agriculture or computer science .
The United States , the world leader in scientific research , has displaced Germany as the top collaborator with Russian researchers , the report found .
“ The opportunities for other countries to link to Russia ’s institutions of learning must be extensive , ” the report reads .
“ The gains for partners are likely to be significant , based simply on Russia ’s historical contributions .
But partners may need to bring resources to the party to enable Russia to participate . ”
Cuts in funding and an aging work force have not helped , the report said .
“ By one 2007 account , a few of the best Russian research institutes have budgets for research amounting to 3 - 5 percent of comparably sized institutes in the United States , ” the report reads .
The average age for a member of the Russian Academy of Science is over 50 , and the prestige of a field that gave birth to Sputnik as the ultimate expression of Cold War rivalry has plummeted .
Just 1 percent of Russians polled in 2006 named science as a prestigious career .
For a man whose son became one of the most polarizing , controversial and even hated figures in U.S. history , a mouthful of pizza may not be worth a mouthful of profanity .
At an unidentified pizza shop visited by George H.W. Bush recently , one of the customers decided to give the former president a slice of his mind , replete with generous toppings .
“ Murderous , Zionist piece of shit , ” the man said as he filmed the scene .
Bush ’s entourage of guards quickly turned and began walking toward the camera .

Zionism is a Jewish political movement that ultimately led to a reestablishment of Jewish sovereignty over the lands of ancient Israel .
“ You wo n’t get your new world order , guys , ” he continued , an apparent reference of Bush ’s use of the term in his 1991 State of the Union address .
The term “ new world order ” originated with an analysis of world affairs and preponderance of what it would take to bring about a lasting global peace , published by celebrated author and life - long socialist H.G. Wells in 1939 .
Wells called for “ a rational consolidation of human affairs ” under what he perceived to be the rapidly approaching mantle of global governance and what he called the failure of dictatorship by proletariat .
It has since become a favored term of both heads of state all over the world and political activists fighting the erosion of national sovereignty in the face of globalism ’s growing influence .
“ Are you happy for the millions of deaths you ’re part of ? ” the man continued .
“ People know .
People are waking up to the reality of this , Mr. Bush . ”

“ That ’s unnecessary , ” one of the guards says as he edges the man out of the store ’s front door .
“ No , it is n’t unnecessary , ” the cameraman replied .
“ The guy is responsible for killing millions .
If you knew anything about real history … ” he trailed at the clip ’s end .
After this debacle , Bush may think again before strolling into random pizza joints .

Egy civil mozgalom tagjai arra vállalkoznak , hogy segítenek eligazodni a választási kampányban : beárazzák a pártok ígéreteit , megnézik , mennyire ütik egymást és a pártprogramot a javaslatok , és kiderül az is , mennyire szólnak a politikusok Magyarország legégetőbb problémáiról .
Az irány egy felelősségteljesebb társadalom megszületése .
Emlékeznek még arra , mikor verték át Önöket legutóbb úgy istenigazából a politikusok ?
Emlékeznek arra , mi volt négy éve ?
Ötéves nagy adócsökkentő program , megfejelve a sztrádaprogram folytatásával , és közben 2010 - re euró lesz Magyarországon – ígérte még a 2006 - os parlamenti választási kampányban az MSZP , amire a Fidesz 29 - ről 19 százalékra csökkenő tb - járulékkal és ezzel párhuzamosan a 14 .
havi nyugdíjjal kontrázott .
A választások után nem egészen két hónappal aztán jött a Gyurcsány - csomag , mindenféle megszorítással .
Akkor nem érezték úgy , hogy jól palira vették Önöket ?
Kérnek még hasonló nagy pofonokat ?
És arra emlékeznek , hogy milyen fejetlenség volt 2006 őszén , az őszödi beszéd kiszivárgása után , és a felfordulás közepette a társadalom az értelmiség iránymutató szerepét igényelte ?
Na és az megvan , hogy rá két évre a leszerepelt elitnek ( a féltudású magyar elitnek ) milyen keményen mentek neki a médiában többen , megint csak nagyobb szerepvállalásra sarkallva az értelmiséget ?
Ilyen még nem volt Magyarországon
Tizenkét , a pártoktól független közgazdász abban bízik , sikerül úttörő szerepet vállalniuk és legalább részben betölteniük ezt az űrt .
Útjára indítottak egy civil kezdeményezést , és ha ez a tizenkét közgazdász jól végzi önként vállalt dolgát , talán elkerülhet ő lesz , hogy a felelőtlen nagyotmondással , a cukorkaosztogatással , az ígéretcunami árát titkolva következmények nélkül lehessen kampányolni .
" A piszkos tizenkett ő " Bartha Attila , Kopint - Tárki Békés Gábor Cseres - Gergely Zsombor , Budapest Intézet Madár István , Portoflio.hu , Budapesti Corvinus Egyetem Muraközy Balázs Reszket ő Petra , Budapest Intézet Scharle Ágota , Budapest Intézet Tóth István János , Gazdaság és Vállalkozáselemzési Intézet Váradi Balázs , Budapest Intézet , ELTE és három anonim pénzügyi szakért ő
Szándékuk szerint ez az első lépés lehet ahhoz , hogy a társadalom a jövőben igényt támasszon arra , hogy a pártok ne az ország gazdaságát romba döntő ígéretversenyt folytassanak , hogy a kampányban azt is mondják el , mi az ára és következménye annak , ha egy - egy társadalmi csoportot helyzetbe hozó intézkedéssel édesgetik magukhoz a választókat .
A cél , hogy a választók felismerjék , gyakorlatilag trade - offok ( átváltások , amikor a szűkös erőforrások miatt az egyik célt egy másik kárára lehet csak elérni ) közötti döntésről szól a voksolás .
Így pedig teljesen más mederben folyhatna a kampány , és a lakosság tagjai felelősségteljesebb döntést hozhatnának .
Sólyomék üdvözlik
A tizenkét tagú civil társaság a Mit ígérnek ?
néven honlapot indított .
A tagok azt ígérik , hogy elfogulatlanul , a pártoktól egyforma távolságot tartva , egységes módszertan alapján elemzik a pártok programjait , és az eredményeikről folyamatosan , közérthető módon számolnak be a mitigernek .
hu honlapon .
Ez a kezdeményezés hasznos és üdvözlend ő – így reagált a civil mozgalom fellépésének hírére Wéber Ferenc , a Köztársasági Elnöki Hivatal sajtófőnöke .
Ez egybecseng azzal , hogy Sólyom László államf ő 2006 - ban és 2010 - ben is arra buzdította a választókat , alaposan vizsgálják meg az ígéretek és ígérgetők hitelességét , ami segíthet a tisztán látásban .
A véleményformáló értelmiség ízlése a mérce
A társaság először a véleményformáló értelmiség negyvenegy tagját kérdezte meg arról , hogy szerintük melyek a legégetőbb problémák ma Magyarországon .
Közülük huszonheten töltötték ki a kérdőívet .
Ha politikai dimenzióban gondolkodunk , akkor a válaszolók között találunk a közvélemény által jobboldalinak , baloldalinak , liberálisnak besorolt , vagy éppen ismert pártkötődés nélküli közgazdászokat , társadalomtudósokat , értelmiségieket ( a teljesség igénye nélkül : Bod Péter Ákos , Chikán Attila , Fazekas Károly , Ferge Zsuzsa , Hamecz István , László Csaba , Nagy Zoltán , Pete Péter , Török Gábor járult hozzá a kezdeményezés sikeréhez a kérdőív kitöltésével ) .
A kezdeményezés tagjai egyébként ezzel is azt szeretnék biztosítani , hogy ne lehessen elfogultsággal , részrehajlással vádolni kísérletüket és a majdani eredmények miatt őket magukat .
A válaszadók a közoktatás minőségét és hatékonyságát , a korrupciót és pártfinanszírozást , a roma integrációt , valamint az egészségügy átalakítását ítélték Magyarország legégetőbb problémáinak , ezek állnak a kérdőívet kitöltők válaszai alapján összeállt lista első négy helyén ( a témaköröket fontosságuk alapján 1 - 5 - ig osztályozhatták a válaszadók , a táblázatban az látszik , melyik osztályzatot hányan választották az egyes témaköröknél ) .
Érdekesség , hogy például az euróbevezetés , csak a 17 - ik helyre került az egyelőre 27 témakört felsoroló listán .
A végső lista a tervek szerint tíz - tizenöt elemből fog állni .
Ez lesz a mérce : első lépésben a civil kezdeményezés tagjai azt mérik majd , hogy ehhez a listához képest a pártprogramok , a politikusok megnyilvánulásai mennyire szólnak a listán felsorolt témákról , és hogy a politikusok mennyire következetesen érintik ezeket a területeket .
A teljes eredmény ( pdf- formátumban ) itt látható .
A legfontosabb kérdések rangsora pontszám alapján 1 2 3 4 5 Átlag 1 . közoktatás minősége és hatékonysága 0 0 3 7 16 4.50 2 . korrupció és pártfinanszírozás 0 0 2 9 15 4.50 3 . a roma / cigány népesség integrációja 0 1 3 5 17 4.46 4 . egészségügy minősége és hatékonysága 0 1 3 7 15 4.38 5 . képzetlenek alacsony foglalkoztatási rátája 0 1 3 10 12 4.27 6 . költségvetési politika stabilitása , kiszámíthatósága 0 1 5 6 14 4.27 7 . vállalkozásbarát / teljesítményt ösztönző adórendszer 0 0 4 11 11 4.27
Sokat elárul egy pártprogram komolyságáról , hogy konkrét válaszokkal , elnagyolt víziókkal , vagy sehogyan sem reagál a legfontosabb gazdasági kérdésekre – magyarázza a módszerük mögötti megfontolást Reszkető Petra , a kezdeményezés egyik tagja , a Budapest Intézet elemzője .
A holland minta
Hollandiában magyar szemmel nézve egészen utópisztikus gyakorlat alakult ki a választási kampány során .
Ott minden párt felkéri az ottani költségvetési hivatalt , hogy árazza be a pártprogramját öt évre , azaz számolja ki , hogy az adott párt ígéreteinek összessége öt év alatt hogyan hat az államháztartásra , és ebből a választók következtethetnek arra is , hogy milyen társadalompolitikai hatásokkal járna adott párt programja .
Hollandiában odáig fejlődött ez az egész ügy , hogy nem tekintik komoly pártnak azt , amelyik nem áraztatja be a programját a független költségvetési hivatallal .
Második körben a kezdeményezés tagjai azt értékelik , hogy az egyes pártok ígéretei mennyire állnak összhangban a programban deklarált célokkal és mennyire konzisztensek az ígéretek egymással , az ígéretek hogyan szolgálják a párt által vallott értékeket .
Ez a nézőpont nem arra keresi a választ , hogy az adott párt által vallott célok helyesek-e vagy sem , hanem az derül ki , hogy a pártpolitikusok ígéretei nem ütik-e egymást és a pártprogramban lefektetett célok elérését segítik-e , vagyis voltaképpen komolyan vehet ők-e a saját maguk elé állított mérce alapján – fejti ki Madár István , a kezdeményezés másik alapító tagja , a Porfolio .hu elemzője .
Harmadszorra az elemzők gyakorlatilag beárazzák a választási ígéreteket .
A számítások alapján kiderülhet , hogy a kellően konkrét vállalások mennyivel növelik az állami kiadásokat , milyen mértékben apasztják a költségvetési bevételeket , vagyis hogy a programok végrehajtása milyen terheket ró az államháztartásra .
A választók így valamiféle képet kaphatnak arról , hogy a választási kampányban tett ígéretek mivel is járnak ( gyakorlatilag menyivel rontják a költségvetési egyenleget ) , így pedig arról is elképzelésük lehet , hogy az ígéreteknek milyen ára van , mik lehetnek a politikusok által előszeretettel elhallgatott kellemetlen következmények a jövőben .
Az elképzelések szerint a kezdeményezés tagjai meghatározott időközönként , egy - két hetenként nyilvánosságra hozzák , hogy mire jutottak az adott id őszakban elhangzott ígéreteket vizsgálva , a választási hajrában pedig átfogó elemzéssel is előállnak .
Electronic Arts Inc. lowered its fiscal - year guidance for the second time in two months as the big videogame publisher continues to suffer from a lack of compelling titles .
The company 's warning comes as Electronic Arts , which has some of the highest development costs in the industry , is downsizing to focus on fewer games amid an industrywide slowdown in sales .
The Redwood City , Calif. , company blamed its latest warning on weakness in Europe in December and a shift to lower - margin products in the latest quarter , primarily in North America .
The warning reflects how the videogame industry 's top two to three titles are selling well at retail , but nothing else is , said Signal Hill Group analyst Todd Greenwald .
Activision Blizzard Inc.'s " Modern Warfare 2 " and other big - selling titles " are sucking the air out of the rest of the market , " Mr. Greenwald said .
Because Electronic
Arts does n't publish as many top - selling titles as its rivals do , the company , known for its Rock Band and Madden videogame franchises , is especially susceptible to the recession - driven trend of consumers not spending their entertainment dollars on videogames that fall below blockbuster status , according to analysts .
After days of wild speculation and ridiculously fast - growing threads on AmigaWorld.net , we finally know most of what we need to know about the new Amiga .
This is not just a random PowerPC evaluation board that you can stuff in a generic case – no , this is an all - new system with a custom motherboard , and some very , very interesting innovations – like a fully customisable co-processor .
Twenty - five years after the introduction of the first Amiga , this is one heck of a machine .
The new machine is called the AmigaOne X1000 , a nod to the original A1000 Amiga that stunned the world 25 years ago , bringing features like multitasking , accelerated graphics , and on - the - fly resolution changes to the world of computing in a time where Windows did n’t have overlapping windows , and where the monochrome Macintosh could n’t hold more than 8 pages in its word processor .
The AmigaOne X1000 catapults the Amiga platform into modernity , providing a rather flexible and powerful machine to run the AmigaOS on .
It comes with a dual - core PowerPC processor , conforming to the Power ISA 2.04 standard .
They cannot exactly reveal which processor it is , as orders from “ higher up ” forbid them to ( AMCC Titan ? ) .
AmigaOS 4 developers currently run the processor at 1.6 Ghz , but this is not the actual nominal clock speed .
Apart from the processor , the AmigaOne X1000 comes with some innovations that take the machine beyond the level of mere custom chips .
The original Amiga was the first machine to employ the idea of custom chips for e.g. graphics , a practice adopted by the PC and Mac worlds much , much later ( but in a cruder manner ) , so with the X1000 , A - eon is taking it a step further : customisable processors .
The X1000 has an XMOS XCore , as the rumour mill had already suggested , and A - eon has renamed it Xena , in keeping with the traditions of the Amiga world .
It ’s a programmable CPU , following the Software Defined Silicon concept developed by XMOS .
INMOS transputer architect David May is one of the people behind XMOS .
“ Capable of eight concurrent real - time threads with shared memory space , at up to 400 MIPS ( about 6 68060s worth ) , Xena gives the X1000 a very flexible , very expandable co-processor , ” A - eon writes , “ The uses are endless ; control hardware , DSP functions , robotics , display – even SID chip and console emulators . ”
If 400 MIPS sounds a bit slow to you , wait until you hear about the Xorro slot .
To accompany ‘ Xena ’ , we have ‘ Xorro ’ , a new slot using an industry - standard PCIe x8 form factor to give access to the ‘ Xena ’ IO .
This will be the route to Xena ’s 64 IO lines , which are dynamically configurable as input , output , or bidirectional .
‘ Xorro ’ will allow bridging Xena to external hardware for control purposes , to internal systems , or to other Xcore processors .
This last point is worth more exploration ; XCore is a parallel processing architecture , and if you want more power , you can simply chain more XCores together [ something like this ] .
Reference boards have been made with up to 256 cores , offering a theoretical 102400 MIPS .
Those of you interested in high - end imaging or scientific applications , for example , take note .
I have to say that I absolutely love this .
Of course , I ca n’t program such chips myself ( or at all ) , but the idea of putting something as flexible as this in the hands of talented and resourceful programmers just makes me very , very excited about what they can come up with .
It wo n’t catapult the Amiga into the realms of Windows and Mac OS X , but it does give it a clear - cut advantage over them .

The machine will come with a custom case too , but little is known about that for now , apart from a small shot that did n’t reveal anything specific .
Together with ACube ’s sam440ep at the lower end , the X1000 hopes to usher in a brighter future for the Amiga platform .
The X1000 will arrive before the summer , and will be cheaper than the original A1000 – which cost 1295 USD in ’ 80s money .
“ Thanks to Xena and the Xorro interface , the X1000 offers extraordinary flexibility .
We believe that with this easy gateway to the world of ‘ Software Defined Silicon ’ and a path to massive parallelism , the X1000 will once more make the AmigaOS platform the best choice for truly creative and unique applications , ” A - eon writes , “ For custom hardware control from robotics to theatrical lighting , for hobbyist creativity , for hardware hacking and for a multitude of applications we have n’t even imagined yet , the X1000 is a dream platform – and therein lies another meaning of ‘ X ’ , the unknown .
It is you , not us , who will define the future . ”
After so many dark years of uncertainty and legal nonsense , it ’s great to see the persistence of the Amiga community rewarded with a truly special computer .
Boing !
Tractors are more than a utility to those that use them .
People take pride in the visual appearance of their tractors and many consider these formidable machines a piece of art in their own right .
This is why , in the art world , artists often express themselves through form and function ( we ’re sure Chip Foose would agree ) .
Scouring the web for examples of such , we were surprised to find so many used tractors being utilized for art .
We hope you enjoy this collection of 30 tractor - related artworks .
Whoever said art and tractors do n’t mix ?

ZURICH -- A Libyan court sentenced two Swiss businessmen to 16 months in prison for violation of residency laws , just two days after a vote in Switzerland to ban the construction of minarets sparked criticism in the Muslim world .
In addition to the prison sentence , the court fined the pair 2,000 dinars ( $ 1,600 ) each .
The men -- Max Goeldi , the country head in Libya for a Swiss engineering group , and Rachid Hamdani -- have been detained in the country since July 2008 , when Geneva police arrested Moammar Gadhafi 's son Hannibal ...
Chuck Todd actually gets this right on Meet The Press .
Gregory played a clip of Dick Armey trying to say that the teabaggers represent the " center " of American politics as bizarre as that may sound and it was Chuck Todd who corrected that lie .
FOX
News grabbed them , promoted them , sent their hosts to caress and nurture them and were the first network in the history of broadcasting to become true political activists that worked to undermine a newly elected president .
FOX News is the Ministry of Propaganda for the GOP .
Meet The Press :
MR. GREGORY : There 's also the issue of the sort of opposition that the president faces .
Where is the Republican Party ?
We talked a little bit about that .
Again , part of the conversation we 've had outside the hour today in some outside interviews includes one with Dick Armey , a former congressman who 's now part of FreedomWorks , who is part of this tea party movement that was influential in Massachusetts and elsewhere .
Here 's what he said about the center of American politics .
( Videotape ) FMR .
REP .
DICK ARMEY ( R - TX ) : This is the broad center of American politics .
Look at the polling data .
Right now the tea party polls higher than the Republicans and the Democrats .
And it is becoming increasingly clear to the electorate out there , and they 're expressing their understanding , it is the Democrat majority in Congress and the president that 's on the liberal fringe and we are on the center .
There 's no doubt about it .
TODD : I do n't know they are in the center .
I mean when we did our own polling on this it's clear that the tea party gets a big benefit because there is one news organization that gives them a huge bump all the time .
I mean they are favorable among
Fox viewers is through the roof and the rest of the country sort of does n't know a lot about these folks .
But the message of the tea party sort of saying the government does n't work , these institutions and we 've got to shrink the size of government , is tapping into what we were just discussing before which is this -- not disgust but sort of this distrust of all institutions that are out there .
Government included .
But I think that , I want to go to something E.J. said about the Republican Party .
I think the most striking thing about the minority party today is that a Republican can't go home and it's mostly because of this tea party crap cannot go home and sell a piece of pork that they got from Washington .
It 's now when you bring home something , saying hey , " I brought federal dollars to this , " you 're on the defensive now .
And so that does make the president 's challenge -- it 's not as if he can trade , you know , go and have these trades with a Susan Collins or an Olympia Snowe or let 's say a Lamar -- let 's move over to more of the conservative center right -- Lamar Alexander or something like this because they 're not getting a benefit at home of bringing something back because we have like destroyed this idea that somehow anything from government that comes through is bad .

In a lawsuit filed against hot dog manufacturers , the nonprofit Cancer Project is seeking to force all hot dogs sold in the state of New Jersey to carry a label reading , " Warning : Consuming hot dogs and other processed meats increases the risk of cancer . " " Just as tobacco causes lung cancer , processed meats are linked to colon cancer , " said Cancer Project President Neal Barnard , of George Washington University Medical School .
" Companies that sell hot dogs are well aware of the danger , and their customers deserve the same information .
" The Cancer Project is a project of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine , which promotes a vegan diet and condemns animal research .
The lawsuit cites numerous studies that have implicated processed meat consumption in a higher cancer risk , including a recent report by the American Institute for Cancer Research .
According to this report , eating just one 50 gram serving of processed meat per day ( the equivalent of one hot dog ) increases a person 's risk of colorectal cancer by an average of 21 percent .
The Cancer Project largely blames hot dogs ' cancer - causing effects on nitrites , a class of preservatives that break down into carcinogenic compounds when digested .
Other researchers have argued that the high fat content of processed meat is much more likely to cause cancer , but the Cancer Project argues that this debate is not relevant to its lawsuit .
" This situation is similar to the link between the smoking of tobacco products and lung cancer :
While all the molecular events linking the smoking of tobacco to the development of lung cancer are not known , the link cannot be disputed , " the legal complaint says .
According to nutritionist Keith - Thomas Ayoob of Albert Einstein College of Medicine , focusing too much on hot dogs might be missing the point .
" The stuff people typically have with a hot dog may be a more immediate concern : too many calories from all the fat - laden potato and macaroni salads , sugary drinks and sweet desserts , " he said .

As breathtakingly bad as the picture is , what we 're looking at here could very well be the first shot of HTC 's upcoming Bravo in the wild -- the industrial design lines up nicely with what we 've seen in the company 's leaked roadmap , anyway , and that funky little optical pad in the center perfectly matches the component that you can clearly see on the Legend render .
It 's said to be " near identical " to the Nexus One -- which makes sense considering that we thought the Nexus One was the Bravo for a while -- so the big draws here would have to be the removal of the trackball ( we 're not complaining ) and the Sense UI covering up Android 2.1 's default look .

The electromagnetic waves emitted by mobile phones could protect against and even reverse Alzheimer 's disease , according to a US study .
Researchers at the University of South Florida exposed 96 mice , most of whom had been genetically altered to develop the Alzheimer 's disease as they aged , to electromagnetic waves generated by mobile phones .
The mice were zapped with 918 - megaherz of frequency twice a day for an hour each time over nine months - the equivalent of several decades in humans .
In older mice with Alzheimer 's , long - term exposure to the electromagnetic fields caused the erasure of deposits of beta- amyloid - a protein fragment that accumulates in the brain of Alzheimer 's sufferers to form the disease 's signature plaques .
Memory impairment in the older mice disappeared , too , the study showed .
It also found that young adult mice with no apparent signs of memory impairment were protected against Alzheimer 's disease after several months of exposure to the mobile phone waves .
The memory levels of normal mice with no genetic predisposition for Alzheimer 's disease were also boosted after exposure to the electromagnetic waves .
The study was the first to look at the long - term effects of mobile phone exposure in mice or humans , and its findings took the researchers by surprise .
" I started this work with a hypothesis that the electromagnetic fields would be deleterious to Alzheimer 's mice , " lead author Professor Gary Arendash said .
" When we got our initial results showing a beneficial effect , I thought , ' give it a few more months and it will get bad for them ' .
" It never got bad .
We just kept getting these beneficial effects in both the Alzheimer 's and normal mice . "
Based on the findings , the researchers are hopeful electromagnetic field exposure could be an effective , non-invasive and drug - free way to prevent and treat Alzheimer 's in humans .

Having recently been snipped at by Greenpeace ’s annual survey of electronic company ’s ecological policies , Nintendo released an official statement on the matter to Eurogamer , ensuring customers of their commitment to more sensible , “ green ” - er production .
“ We would like to assure customers that we take our environmental responsibilities seriously and are rigorous in our commitment to comply with all relevant laws relating to environmental and product safety , including avoiding the use of dangerous substances in our manufacturing processes and ensuring the safe disposal and recycling of materials , ” said Nintendo .
“ We consider the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle , from planning to disposal .
In the planning phase , for example , we make every effort to design energy - efficient products and select materials for component parts and packaging materials with careful consideration for the environment .
We also consider the importance of reducing environmental impact at end - of - life disposal by clearly indicating the materials used in each product to make recycling easier .
We also work to eliminate harmful substances from our products right from the initial stages of material selection and have established strict environmental control standards , with our 340 production partners all co-operating with us in our efforts . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House will predict a record budget deficit in the current fiscal year and more big shortfalls for the next decade in its upcoming budget proposal , a congressional source told Reuters on Sunday .
President Barack Obama speaks at the GOP House Issues Conference in Baltimore , Maryland , January 29 , 2010 .

In its budget proposal to be released on Monday , the White House predicts a record $ 1.6 trillion budget deficit for the fiscal year that ends September 30 , the Capitol Hill source said .
According to the estimate , deficits will narrow to $ 700 billion by fiscal 2013 before gradually rising back to $ 1.0 trillion by the end of the decade , the source said .
President Barack Obama will seek to strike a balance between reducing the deficit over the long term and stimulating the economy in the short term to ease the pain of double - digit unemployment .
Criticized by Republicans as a big spender , Obama used his State of the Union address last week to tell Americans he would dig the country out of a “ massive fiscal hole . ”
That hole is even deeper than previously believed , according to the estimate by the White House ’s Office of Management and Budget .
The estimate for the current fiscal year is significantly higher than the $ 1.35 trillion figure forecast by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last week .
Despite the difference , both estimates indicate that the deficit will continue to hover at a level not seen since World War Two , when measured as a percentage of the economy .
Last year the government posted a $ 1.4 trillion deficit .
THREE -YEAR FREEZE WON’T BE ENOUGH
In his budget , Obama will propose a three - year freeze on some domestic programs to save $ 20 billion next year and $ 250 billion over the coming decade .
But that will not be enough to get deficits down permanently to the 3 percent of gross domestic product that most economists consider sustainable .
Deficits are projected to fall as the economy recovers , but they will still average roughly 4.5 percent of GDP over the coming decade , according to the estimate .
Deficits are expected to rise again toward the end of the decade due to the increasing cost of retirement and healthcare programs as the “ baby boom ” generation retires .
Obama has warned that the burgeoning U.S. debt could unnerve U.S. financial markets , driving up borrowing costs and putting future economic growth at risk .
China , the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries , has urged the United States to get its fiscal house in order .
The grim forecast could help build support for a bipartisan commission proposed by the White House that would recommend ways to address long - term budget problems .
Obama and his fellow Democrats face a growing voter backlash for the aggressive spending measures they have taken to stimulate the economy .
But Democrats point out that most of the fiscal mess has been inherited from the previous administration of Republican George W. Bush , who cut taxes and created an expensive prescription drug - benefit while pursuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The recession , which began in December 2007 and ended last year , also worsened the fiscal picture by depressing government revenues while forcing up spending on unemployment benefits and other safety - net programs .

Help , I just got a new espresso machine and my shots are horrible !
If you frequent the forums , you have no doubt seen this reoccurring topic .
Dialing in a new machine for an inexperienced Barista can be a bit daunting , especially if you have a new grinder to accompany that shiny new espresso machine .
Many novice users start with too high an expectation and the incorrect assumption that if I purchase a quality espresso machine and grinder I can automatically make good espresso .
Just because you own an espresso machine does not mean you can make espresso .
It takes time and a lot of practice to develop the basic Barista skills of grind , dose and tamp .
In practice it sounds simple , grind your beans , dose them into the portafilter , mash it flat and make your cup .
Unfortunately , this is deceivingly simplistic .
It is more akin to an algebraic formula , each variable being dependent on the others .
By changing one variable , you change the dynamics of the entire equation .
Too often a new Barista goes about the process in an over exuberant fashion changing the grind , dose , tamp , brew pressure , boiler pressure , coffee blend etc ... all at the same time .
The key to make one change at a time , observe the results and make another small change based on your observation .
I am the new owner of an Elektra A3 espresso machine .
So I decided to document my dialing in of the machine and grind in hopes of helping others with the same process .
My kit did not include a new grinder ; I am still using my La Cimbali Jr. grinder so I already know how my grinder will respond to a change .
I loaded up the grinder with some two week + old coffee ; this is well beyond its prime but should still have enough serviceable life in it to get started .
I set my grinder on 4.5 which I knew was too coarse .
These are the frightening results .
Shot one , the grinder set at 4.5 , 50 pound tamp , and 20 gram dose in the stock double basket .
As you can see , 20 grams was too much , the machine was choked and the extraction barely started .
The pucks surface was grinding against the shower screen due to the over dosed basket .
Shot two .
I kept the grind and tamp the same and reduced the dose to 18 grams .
My scale was jumping between 18 and 19 grams so this was a heavy 18 gram dose .
I do have to say that having read Dan 's review on the A3 , I already knew it did not respond well to overdosing .
Let me also add that this dose did not make heavy contact with the shower screen but was very , very close .
To check that , dose and tamp your portafilter then lock it into the group .
Then remove the portafilter .
If you can see even the lightest impression of a screw head or other parts of the shower screen , you are still overdosed .
This dose was just touching on the outer edges of the puck .
You may want to stand back from your computer for this one .
You do n't want to get sprayed in the eye .
Boy , that one was nasty , but we now know what happens when we change the dose from 20 , to 18 + grams .
If you look closely at the photo below , you can see several pinholes in the puck , those are the sources of the channeling .
Shot three .
I kept the grind and tamp the same as shots one and two but further reduced the dose to 17 grams .
The headspace was just about right on this one .
The massive channeling was reduced although the shot was way too fast and I still had donut extractions .
The perimeter of the basket starts first but we have a slow spot in the center of the basket .
After these three shots we have learned that the A3 does not like to be overdosed .
With the given grind and tamp , the 17 gram dose provided adequate headspace and the best extraction of the three .
The next step is to fine up the grind one notch in an attempt to slow the extraction .
I start with a dose of 18 grams while keeping the distribution and tamp the same .
Why go back to 18 grams ?
As I stated above , all of these variables are dependent on each other .
Since we changed the grind , the dose may have been effected as well .
So I am bracketing the extraction again to see what effect it has .
The grinder is now set at 4.25 , the dose is 18 grams and the distribution and tamp remain the same .
The extraction was better than the original 18 gram dose .
The shot starts more even but still favors the front of the basket .
It develops nicely but half way through the shot we see signs of channeling , then suddenly the flow runs fast and blond .
For the fifth shot I retain the 4.25 grind setting and down dose to 17 grams , once again keeping the distribution and tamp the same .
This time the shot starts more abrupt and flows faster .
We still have some channeling , the 18 gram dose worked best with the finer grind .
So after 5 shots what have we learned .
The A3 does not like to be over dosed .
The 17 and 18 gram dose worked best depending on the grind that was used .
We also learned that two week old beans are not going to produce an acceptable shot .
So for those of you that spend $ 2000 for you kit and decide to use cheap grocery store beans to dial in your machine , you are wasting your time .
If two week old beans are too stale to produce a good shot , what do you think two month old beans will do .
Please , do yourself a favor and invest in two pounds of good beans to learn with .
We also discovered that my tamp favors the front of the basket .
That has nothing to do with the machine or grinder , but a flaw in the Barista 's ( my ) technique .
More to come .
Two ballot measures that would raise taxes on businesses and higher - income residents in Oregon appeared headed for approval late Tuesday .
The tax increases , which would raise about $ 727 million largely for public education and social services , were approved last year by the Legislature , but later put to a public referendum after opponents gathered signatures in a petition campaign .
The Legislature , controlled by Democrats , has already put the $ 727 million into the current budget .
So if the ballot items , known as Measures 66 and 67 , had been rejected , lawmakers would have been forced to hold a special session to find other ways to reduce spending or raise revenue .
Tax measures have frequently failed at the polls in Oregon , one of only five states without a state sales tax .
The state depends largely on income and property taxes to raise revenue .

Michael Schumacher completed his three - day testing session with a GP2 car on Thursday at the Jerez circuit , where the German came within four tenths of the track record .
The seven - time champion had to run again with wet - weather tyres in the morning but was able to use slicks for the remaining part of the session , covering a total of 1,151 kms over the three days of the test .
Schumacher 's best lap of the day was a 1m24.621s , four tenths slower than the record set by Kamui Kobayashi at the Spanish track in October , 2008 .
" I could really drive a lot on this last day of testing and it worked out perfectly , " Schumacher said .
" I am very happy with the way testing went here : we worked well , times and consistency were well , we could do everything we had scheduled to do .
I feel fit , I felt comfortable immediately back in the car - hey , let 's go for it ! "
GP2 Series organiser Bruno Michel added : " This has been a fantastic opportunity for the GP2 Series and everyone involved in the competition .
" Michael Schumacher 's analysis and feedback was fantastic and the GP2 technical staff who has been working with him this week is positive that what has been learned from this development test will provide us with an even better car in 2011 .
" We are very happy that Michael chose our car to get his sensations back at the wheel of a high performance machine and that he stated that it was the closest thing to a current Formula 1 car .
He made a few comments comparing the GP2 and the F1 cars notably regarding their handling .
" We are now looking forward the second round of the GP2 Asia Series next month in Abu Dhabi and we would like to wish Michael all the best for his return to Formula 1 . "

Unemployment in Bulgaria by the end of November has reached 320,000 people which is with 104,000 people more compared to a year earlier , the data of Industry Watch show .
According to the Employment Agency , the unemployment rate in November has reached 8.7 % .
The economic experts of Industry Watch say though , that the information of the Employment Agency differ from that of the National Statistical Institute which claims that at the end of the 3rd quarter the unemployed were 234,000 people while the Employment Agency shows that the number of the unemployed for the same period was 290,000 people .
There are also significant differences in employment rates in different Bulgarian regions .
Traditionally , the unemployment in Northern Bulgaria is higher than the average for the country .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A former Guantanamo inmate who fled to Yemen to help lead an al Qaeda branch after his release says he was motivated by the memory of abuse he says he suffered in U.S. custody , the BBC reported on Wednesday .
Mohammed al - Awfi in an undated file photo .
REUTERS / Saudi Press Agency
Concern about Yemen - based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has risen sharply since it claimed responsibility for a failed plot to blow up a U.S. passenger jet on December 25 .
The group has several former Guantanamo detainees in its ranks , which are believed to number about 300 .
The former Guantanamo detainee , a Saudi named Mohammed al - Awfi , said he had been tortured while in detention six years ago at the Bagram U.S. military base in Afghanistan before he was sent to Guantanamo , the BBC reported him as saying .
The memory of this abuse doomed efforts by Saudi officials to ensure he did not resume militant activities , he told the BBC in an interview in Saudi Arabia , where he has been in prison following his surrender to Yemeni and Saudi authorities in 2009 .
“ When I asked al - Awfi why the rehabilitation program had not worked for him , he said it was because the memories of what he had suffered at the hands of Americans were far more powerful than any corrective inducements he had received in the Care program , ” BBC journalist Peter Taylor wrote in an online report , referring to a Saudi deradicalization campaign aimed at former Guantanamo detainees .
“ Al - Awfi claimed his U.S. interrogators had done terrible things to him .
He alleges they sat him on a chair , made a hole in the seat , and then “ pulled out the testicles from underneath which they then hit with a metal rod ” , ” Taylor reported .
“ They ’d then tie up your penis and make you drink salty water in order to make you urinate without being able to do so , until they make you scream , ” Taylor quoted him as saying .
Pentagon officials in Washington had no immediate comment .
Taylor ’s interview with Awfi is to be broadcast on Wednesday at 2230 GMT on BBC Television ’s Newsnight program .
Al - Awfi and another Saudi freed from Guantanamo , Mohammed al - Shehri , announced in an Internet video in January 2009 that they had joined the Yemen - based al Qaeda group as commanders .
Both men had entered a Saudi rehabilitation program after their release from the U.S. detention center in late 2007 .
The program involves counseling by Muslim clerics to alter their thinking , extensive contact with their families , and practical help to reintegrate them into society .
The program is credited with helping erode support for al Qaeda in the kingdom .
But the two men’s well - publicized return to al Qaeda embarrassed the Saudi authorities .
The Saudi Interior Ministry has said Awfi gave himself up in 2009 after contacting his family and asking them to get in touch with officials from the rehabilitation program .
U.S. officials said last week a Pentagon assessment showed about one in five inmates freed from Guantanamo had joined or was suspected of joining militant groups like al Qaeda .
Under pressure to increase safeguards , U.S. authorities on January 5 said they had suspended the transfer of more Guantanamo detainees to Yemen , citing deteriorating security in the country .
Location - aware search with Apache Lucene and Solr
Combine unstructured text and spatial data to enhance your search applications
Location , location , location !
Just as location is king in real estate , search plus location awareness can yield significant dividends in helping users effectively and efficiently find information .
For instance , if you are a business - directory provider ( such as a " Yellow Pages " site ) , when a user searches for a plumber , the site should return results for plumbers near the user 's home .
If you run a tourism site , you might want to allow travelers to search for places of interest near their destination in order to locate services that will help them enjoy their visit .
If you 're building a social - networking site , you might use location information to help users connect with friends .
And the ubiquity of location - aware devices , such as in - car navigation systems and GPS - enabled cameras — and the large volume of publicly available map data — provide a wide variety of opportunities for building out Geographical Information Systems ( GIS ) that incorporate search to produce superior results for end users .
Use of spatial information goes well beyond search , but in this article I 'll focus on how you can take advantage of spatial information to enhance your search application by leveraging the capabilities of Apache Lucene and Apache Solr .
Why use a search engine ?
By no means is it a requirement , given that many good ( even free ) GIS tools are available .
However , basing your application on search offers several powerful features where many other approaches traditionally fail .
Search systems are effective at combining structured and unstructured data , enabling users to enter free - form queries that search free text such as descriptions and titles while restricting or altering the results based on geographical data .
For instance , a travel site could implement a feature whereby a user can ask to find all hotels in Boston , Mass .
with a 4 - star rating and the phrase comfortable bed in the review text and 24 - hour room service in the description — all with subsecond response .
A search system such as Apache Solr can also provide faceting ( see Related topics for information on Solr and facets ) , highlighting , and spell checking on the result set so that the application can help users find what they are looking for more effectively .
I 'll start with a brief review of some key Lucene concepts , leaving the deeper details to the reader to research .
Next , I 'll cover some of the basic concepts of geospatial search .
GIS is a large field that could easily consume this entire article and many more , so I will instead focus on some basic concepts that should be fairly intuitive given the need to find services , people , and other items of interest on a daily basis .
I 'll round out the article with some discussion of the approaches available for indexing and searching spatial information using Lucene and Solr .
I 'll ground these concepts in a real , albeit simple , example using data from the OpenStreetMap ( OSM ) project ( see Related topics ) .
Recalling key Lucene concepts
Apache Lucene is a Java™ - based , high performance search library .
Apache Solr is a search server that uses Lucene to provide search , faceting , and many more capabilities over HTTP .
Both are licensed under the commercial - friendly Apache Software License .
See Related topics for more information on the features and APIs that each offers .
At their heart , Solr and Lucene both represent content as a document .
A document is then made up of one or more fields plus an optional boost value indicating the document 's importance .
A field is made up of the actual content to be indexed or stored plus metadata telling Lucene how to handle that content and a boost value indicating that field 's importance .
It is up to you to decide how to represent your content as documents and fields , depending on how you wish to search and otherwise access the information in the document .
You can have a one - to - one relationship between a single unit of your content or a one - to - many relationship .
For instance , I might choose to represent a single Web page as a document with several fields such as title , keywords , and body .
Or , in the case of a book , I may choose to represent each page of the book as a separate document .
As you will see later , this distinction is important when it comes to encoding spatial data for search .
The content in a field can be indexed or just stored as is for use by an application .
If the content is indexed , then the application can search it .
Indexed content can also be analyzed to produce terms , often called tokens .
A term is the basis for lookup and use in the search process .
A term is often a word , but it need not be .
I encourage you to explore the Related topics to learn more about all of these concepts .
On the query side of the coin , Lucene and Solr offer rich capabilities for expressing user queries , ranging from basic keyword ( term ) queries , to phrase and wildcard queries .
Both Lucene and Solr also offer the ability to restrict the space being searched by applying one or more filters , which are key to spatial search .
Range queries and range filters are among the essential mechanisms for restricting the space .
In a range query ( or filter ) , the user states the need to restrict all searched documents to be between two values that have a natural sorting .
For instance , it is common to use a range query to find all documents that occurred last year or last month .
Underneath the hood , Lucene must enumerate the terms in the documents to identify documents that fall within the range .
As I 'll show later , setting this up effectively is one of the keys to performance for filtering in spatial - search applications .
Lucene and Solr also provide the notion of function queries , which allow you to use the value of a field , such as a latitude and longitude , as part of the scoring mechanism , instead of simply the internal collection statistics that comprise the primary scoring mechanism .
This will also come into play later in the article , when I demonstrate using some of Solr 's distance - based functions .
Geospatial search concepts
First and foremost , when building a spatial search application , you need to identify the spatial data to be included in the application .
This data often is in the form of some geocoded system such as latitude , longitude , and elevation , or as a ZIP code or a particular street address .
The more formalized the system for encoding , the easier it will be to work within your system .
For example , the old folk song " Over the River and Through the Woods " ( you know the words : " to Grandmother 's house we go " ) encodes a fair amount of spatial information into the lyrics ( see Related topics ) .
But it is n't all that useful in a GIS system , because we have no clue where the woods or the river are .
Contrast that with detailed directions to Grandma 's that include a starting address and an ending address , and you get the picture of why properly encoded data is important .
( Interestingly , systems that can extract and codify more - generic directions and geographic entities — for example , over the river or near the brown house — and reason about them can also be quite useful , but that discussion is beyond this article 's scope . )
Going beyond the raw , geocoded data used to identify locations , many GIS systems can add information that occurs relative to the physical locations .
For instance , a navigation system may use a series of locations laid out in order on a map to create a route of travel from point A to point B .
Or a meteorologist might overlay rainfall or severe - weather data across a map of an area and allow people to search for rainfall amounts by places of interest .
People living near one another often group together areas to form ZIP codes , area codes , or even towns , cities , and states .
In the case of OSM , users are allowed to edit and overlay information on top of the base map , such as places of interest or even streets .
Combining these overlays to form relationships and tracking them over time can further produce incredibly dynamic and capable applications .
Representing spatial data
Regardless of the overlays or other information associated with one or more locations , search applications need a way to represent this data in an efficient manner .
Although location information can be represented in several ways , I 'll focus on the ones pertinent to Lucene .
First and foremost , many types of geospatial data can be represented in their " raw " format and work just fine with a search application .
For example , Syracuse is a perfectly fine way of representing the city of Syracuse , and users typing Syracuse in the search box will find the documents containing Syracuse just like any other search term .
The raw representation is , in fact , the most common way people represent named locations , such as cities , states , and ZIP codes .
Do note , however , that although I use the phrase raw representation , you can still transform or normalize the data first .
For instance , converting all mentions of New York to NY is often a perfectly reasonable thing to do .
Before I tell you about the representations that Lucene can use , it is important to understand that all representations must take into account the spatial reference that produced them ( see Related topics ) .
In the United States , the most common is the World Geodetic System , often abbreviated as WGS 84 ( see Related topics ) .
Although transformations are possible between some systems , it is best to have all of your data represented in a single system .
From here on , I will assume a single system .
Numeric spatial information such as latitude and longitude ( lat / lon for short ) is where the more interesting representations come into play in terms of search with Lucene and Solr .
Latitude and longitude are usually expressed in degrees , minutes , and seconds from the Prime Meridian ( located in Greenwich , England ) and usually require using a double ( or more ) for precision purposes .
For instance , for the data included in my example — the city of Syracuse , N.Y. , United States — is located around 76.150026 East ( or - 76.150026 if East is not specified ) and 43.049648 North .
Depending on the application , encoding every latitude and longitude can result in a large number of unique terms to be indexed .
This is n't necessarily a show stopper , but it can slow down search significantly , and , as you 'll see later in this article , it is n't always needed .
In fact , many mapping applications only care about bounding the search within a specific area , so storing approximate information about the location often yields far fewer terms without adversely affecting the search results .
This precision - tradeoff approach often captures latitude and longitude into ( Cartesian ) tiers .
You can think of each tier as a zoom level on a specific part of a map , such that tier 2 centered over the United States likely encompasses all of North America , while tier 19 is likely in someone 's backyard .
More specifically , each tier divides the map into 2tier # boxes , or grids .
Each box can then be given a number and indexed onto the document .
I 'll explain in a later section how to leverage this information for faster searches .
Latitude and longitude in Lucene terms are often represented as two different fields , but this can , in some applications , have implications for performance .
If a single field is desired , lat / lon can be encoded into a single String using the Geohash encoding ( see Related topics ) .
Geohashes have the benefit of arbitrary precision by stripping off characters from the end of the hash .
In many cases , locations that are near each other have common prefixes .
For instance , entering Syracuse , NY into geohash.org yields the hash dr9ughxjkrt4b , whereas entering the Syracuse suburb of Cicero , NY yields the hash dr9veggs 4ptd3 , both sharing the dr9 prefix .
So far , I 've dealt specifically with points , but many geospatial applications are also interested in shapes , routes , and other relationships within the data .
These are beyond the scope of what is available in Lucene and Solr ; see Related topics for more information on these concepts .
Combining spatial data with text in search
Once data is represented in an index , search applications typically have at least five basic needs when it comes to interacting with the data :
Distance calculation : Given a point , calculate the distance to one or more other points .
: Given a point , calculate the distance to one or more other points .
Bounding - box filter : Find all matches ( documents ) that occur within some specific area .
: Find all matches ( documents ) that occur within some specific area .
Sorting :
Sort the results for a search by the distance from some fixed point .
: Sort the results for a search by the distance from some fixed point .
Relevancy enhancement :
Use the distance as a boost factor in the score while allowing other factors to play a role too .
: Use the distance as a boost factor in the score while allowing other factors to play a role too .
Query parsing : Given an address or some other user specification of a location , create an encoded representation that can be used to search against the indexed data .
Each of these pieces can play an important role in location - based applications , but for now I 'll focus on distance calculations , bounding - box filtering , and query parsing .
Sorting and relevancy enhancement ( boosting ) just use the distance calculations , and I 'll show how they play out in practice later in the article .
Distance calculations
When calculating distances for use in GIS applications , it is important to understand there are many different approaches , each with its own merits and demerits .
Distance calculations can be split into three groups , depending on how an application chooses to model the Earth .
In some cases , it is perfectly acceptable to assume a flat model of the Earth and lose some accuracy in exchange for speed .
In the flat - model approach , most distance calculations come down to variations on the Pythagorean theorem .
The flat - model approach is often good enough when distances are short and locations are not near the poles .
In other cases , a spherical model is used , and the primary distance calculation used is the great - circle distance ( see Related topics ) .
The great - circle distance calculates the shortest distance between any two points on the surface of a sphere .
The spherical model is better - suited when distances are further apart and more accuracy is needed .
Finally , an ellipsoidal model of the Earth can be used along with the Vincenty formula ( see Related topics ) to obtain highly accurate distances ( down to 0.5 millimeters ) on the ellipsoid , but for most applications the complexity of this calculation is probably not worth it .
Give an inch , take a mile
In many local - search applications , the need for accuracy depends on the application .
In some cases , being off by a mile is no big deal , while in other cases being off by even a few millimeters can matter .
For example , the Euclidean distance is often not accurate enough for spanning larger distances ( say between two states ) , and even the Haversine ( great - circle ) approach may not be accurate enough in some cases , because the Earth is better modeled as an ellipsoid and not a sphere .
In those cases , using Vincenty 's formula may make more sense .
In other applications , the only thing that matters is the ordering of the results , so something like the Squared Euclidean Distance ( which is n't really a distance ) can be used , thus saving a square - root calculation .
Of course , other distances are often useful as well , such as the Manhattan distance , which reflects the distance when one travels through a city laid out in blocks ( as in a cab traveling through Manhattan in New York City ) .
For the purposes of this article , I will demonstrate distances using the flat - Earth model and the great - circle distance and leave the rest to you to explore .
Also note , I am disregarding elevation as a factor here , but some applications may need to account for it .
For more information on geographic distances , see Related topics .
Bounding - box filter
In many location - based applications , millions of pieces of location data are available to be searched .
Iterating through all of this data just to find the set of documents that both contain the keywords of interest and are within some distance of the user 's specified location would be extremely time - consuming .
Naturally , it makes sense to narrow down the set of documents first and then evaluate the relevant subset .
If only latitude and longitude information was stored , then the primary option for narrowing down the document set is by passing in the ranges that encompass the area around the location .
This can be visualized as in Figure 1 , where the slightly opaque box represents a bounding box around the downtown area of Charleston , S.C. :
Figure 1 . Example of a bounding box centered on downtown Charleston , S.C .
If the application also uses tier information or Geohash information , then these values can be used for better narrowing down the number of documents to search .
I will demonstrate this later when discussing the specifics of indexing and searching with Lucene and Solr .
Query parsing
Query parsing comes down to determining which part of the query contains keywords to search for and which part contains location information .
The latter part of this process is called geocoding ( see Related topics ) .
While I will discuss geocoding here in the context of query parsing , it is also useful during indexing .
Consider the following examples of user queries :
1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington , DC
1 Washington Av. Philadelphia Pennsylvania
Mall of America , 60 East Broadway Bloomington , MN 55425
Restaurants near Mall of America
Restaurants in the Mall of America
Examining the first two queries raises a few interesting points :
Order of terms is almost always important , whereas in pure text - based search , order may not be important .
Gazetteers and other spatial resources like GeoNames ( see Related topics ) can be quite useful in converting addresses to locations .
These resources often contain lists of places of interest — for example , landmarks such as the White House .
It is important either to normalize abbreviations such as Ave . and DC or to use synonyms to cover the variety of ways users input address information .
The remaining queries illustrate several other subtleties .
For instance , in the third query , the user has specified a full address ; care must be taken to parse out the name , address , city , state , and ZIP properly if you are going to search against fields for each of those properties .
In the last two queries , the subtle difference between the user 's choice of near versus in is likely important .
Any restaurant within some distance of the Mall would suit the fourth query 's user , whereas the last query 's user is only interested in results inside the Mall .
Query parsing can be quite difficult because of the complexity of describing topics in relation to location , not to mention spelling mistakes , language ambiguity , and bad data .
Despite all the complexities of geocoding , services are available that translate addresses to location .
Two commonly used services are the Google Maps public API and GeoNames ( see Related topics ) .
Unfortunately , using such Web services subjects you to their terms of use ( which often include usage limits ) and Internet traffic concerns .
For real production systems , you are likely better off implementing your own capabilities .
Although such an implementation is beyond this article 's scope , keep in mind that the GeoNames data is all freely downloadable , as are many other spatial resources , such as the CIA Factbook ( see Related topics ) .
Given good resources , it is best to build up from the basics ( address , city , state ) and then include places of interest and robust exception handling .
Over time , your query logs will prove invaluable in creating a robust query parser that gracefully handles whatever users throw at it .
As with any search application , keep in mind it is reasonable to make a best guess while also asking the user for clarification , as can be seen in the Google Maps screen capture in Figure 2 :
Figure 2 .
Best guesses and a request for user clarification on Google Maps
For this article , I will demonstrate a basic query parser that uses the GeoNames service and has a few other features , but I 'll leave it to the reader to implement a production - ready version .
At this point , you should have enough background to get started .
Thus , the remainder of the article will focus on how to index and search spatial information using Lucene and Solr .
Installing the sample code
In order to run the sample code , you need installations of the following :
You also need this article 's sample code ( see Download ) , which includes a copy of Apache Solr and its dependencies .
Follow these steps to install the sample code :
unzip sample .zip cd geospatial - examples ant install Launch Solr : ant start - solr ( to stop Solr later , run ant stop - solr ) Point your browser at http://localhost:8983/solr/admin and confirm that Solr started up properly .
You should see a basic admin screen with a box to run queries in .
Once you have Solr up and running , you 're ready to take the first steps with spatial data in Lucene .
Running the install step will download some sample data generated from the OSM project , which I 've set aside at http://people.apache.org/~gsingers/spatial/.
For this article , I 've included sample OSM data from four locations within the United States that are of interest to me ( permalinks to OSM are listed in the files ) :
Syracuse , N.Y .
Downtown Minneapolis , Minn .
Around the Mall of America in Bloomington , Minn .
Downtown Charleston , S.C .
To demonstrate many of the concepts in this article , I 've written code to index the OSM data into Solr , and to associate some simple facts with specific locations ( for example , see the syracuse .
facts file in the data directory . )
The goal of this effort is to show how unstructured text and spatial data can be combined to create effective search applications .
Note also that I am using the Solr 1.5 - dev version ( the current development trunk for Solr ) , not the recently released Solr 1.4 .
Indexing spatial information in Lucene
Lucene 2.9 added two new features that play an important role in spatial search .
First , Lucene has implemented better numeric - range querying and filtering capabilities , which are often used for bounding - box approaches .
Second , Lucene has a new contrib module containing the stand - alone project formerly called Local Lucene ( see Related topics ) .
( The code lives in contrib / spatial of Lucene ; I 've included the JAR file with the sample code . )
The spatial contrib offers tools for creating Cartesian tiers and Geohash codes , as well as tools for creating Lucene query and filter objects .
Before you look at the code that indexes the data , it is important to assess how you expect to interact with the data and how much data you have to deal with in your application .
For instance , for most people with a small to moderate number of documents ( say , fewer than 10 million ) , indexing latitude and longitude and using simple numeric range queries will likely yield sufficient performance , whereas larger applications may need to do more specific things ( such as add Cartesian tiers ) to reduce the number of terms and documents to be filtered and scored .
It is also important to think about which format to store the information in .
Many spatial distance algorithms require the numbers to be in radians , while others can work with degrees .
Thus , it may be worthwhile to convert your lat / lon values to radians during indexing instead of having to convert them over and over during search time .
The trade - off , of course , is more space ( disk and , possibly , memory ) if you need both formats .
Finally , are you going to be faceting , sorting , and scoring on the location features , rather than just use them for filtering ?
If so , then you may need alternate representations as well .
Because this article is just demonstrating the concepts and is not intended for production use , I will show how to index Geohash , Cartesian tiers , and latitude and longitude all in one place , in some sample Java code .
To get started , I 've defined a number of values in the Solr schema ( located in geospatial - examples / solr / conf / schema.xml ) to capture the OSM data .
The primary fields for location are shown in Listing 1 :
Listing 1 . Sample Solr schema
<!-- Latitude --> < field name = " lat " type =" tdouble " indexed =" true " stored = " true " / > <!-- Longitude --> < field name = " lon " type =" tdouble " indexed =" true " stored = " true " / > <!-- lat / lon in radians
In a real system , use a copy field for these instead of sending over the wire --> < field name = " lat_rad " type =" tdouble " indexed =" true " stored = " true " /> < field name = " lon_rad " type =" tdouble " indexed =" true " stored = " true " / > <!--
Hmm , what about a special field type here ?
--> < field name = " geohash " type =" string " indexed =" true " stored = " true " / > <!--
Elevation data --> < field name = " ele " type =" tfloat " indexed =" true " stored = " true " / > <!--
Store Cartesian tier information --> < dynamicField name = " tier_ * " type =" double " indexed =" true " stored = " true " / >
Lucene and Solr Although I am using the Solr schema to demonstrate the fields to index , all concepts here are easily available in Lucene as well .
For instance , a tdouble is just Lucene 2.9.1 speak for a NumericField with a precision step of 8 .
I am storing the lat / lon values as tdouble fields .
A tdouble is a double represented internally using a Trie structure .
It can then be used by Lucene to significantly reduce the number of terms that need to be evaluated during range calculations ( bounding box ) , despite the fact that it actually adds more terms to the index .
I 'm storing the Geohash as a simple string ( unanalyzed ) because I just want to do exact match on it .
Elevation , although strictly not needed for the kinds of calculations I 'm doing , is stored as a tfloat , which is just a float stored in the Trie structure .
Finally , the tier_* dynamic field allows the application to add Cartesian tier fields dynamically without needing to predeclare each one .
I will leave it to you to explore the other metadata fields captured by the indexing process .
The code responsible for indexing the data is located in the source tree in the sample .
zip file .
The Driver class is a command - line utility for launching the indexing process , and the actual indexing takes place as part of a SAX ContentHandler implementation named OSMHandler .
Within the OSMHandler code , the key lines of interest are in the startElement ( ) method .
I 'll break it out into three sections .
The first example , shown in Listing 2 , indexes the latitude and longitude as double s and also converts them to radians for indexing :
Listing 2 . Sample indexing of latitude / longitude
//... current is a SolrInputDocument double latitude = Double.parseDouble(attributes.getValue ( " lat " ) ) ; double longitude = Double.parseDouble(attributes.getValue ( " lon " ) ) ; current.addField ( " lat " , latitude ) ; current.addField ( " lon " , longitude ) ; current.addField ( " lat_rad " , latitude * TO_RADS ) ; current.addField ( " lon_rad " , longitude * TO_RADS ) ;
Indexing lat / lon is pretty straightforward .
Next , I index the Geohash value for the lat / lon pair , as demonstrated in Listing 3 :
Listing 3 . Sample indexing of Geohash
//... // See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash String geoHash = GeoHashUtils.encode( latitude , longitude ) ; current.addField ( " geohash " , geoHash ) ;
In the Geohash code in Listing 3 , I am using the GeoHashUtils.encode ( ) ( there 's an equivalent decode ( ) method ) method that comes with the Lucene spatial contrib package to convert the lat / lon pair to a single Geohash string , which I then add to the Solr .
Finally , to add Cartesian tier support , I did two things in the OSMHandler code :
In the constructor , I set up n instances of the CartesianTierPlotter class , one for each tier that I wish to index .
instances of the class , one for each tier that I wish to index .
In the startElement ( ) method , I looped over the n plotters and got the identifier for each grid element that contains the latitude and longitude of the current OSM element .
The code for this looks like Listing 4 : Listing 4 .
Sample indexing of Cartesian tiers //... // Cartesian Tiers int tier = START_TIER ; //4 //Create a bunch of tiers , each deeper level has more precision for ( CartesianTierPlotter plotter : plotters ) { current.addField ( " tier_ " + tier , plotter.getTierBoxId( latitude , longitude ) ) ; tier ++ ; }
Typically , a query need only go against one tier at a time , so having multiple tiers usually does not pose a problem .
You should pick the number of tiers you need based on how fine - grained you want to make your search .
If you take the time to look through the rest of the indexing code , you will see I added a variety of other metadata values related to the data points in the OSM files .
I am currently indexing only two OSM data types : a node and a way .
A node is simply a location at a specific latitude and longitude , while a way is a combination of nodes that are all somehow related , such as a street .
( See the OSM Data Primitives link in Related topics to learn more about the OSM files . )
What 's a ?
The CartesianTierPlotter 's job is to take a projection of the Earth ( in my case , I use a Sinusoidal projection ; see Related topics ) and the lat / lon information , convert it down into the grids used by the tier system , and give each grid cell a unique number .
During search , an application can then specify the grid IDs to restrict the search to find results in .
Now that you have an understanding of the basics of creating a Solr document that contains spatial information , it just needs to be executed .
The Driver class takes in the data and fact files plus the URL where Solr is running , and hands off the work to the OSM2 Solr class .
The OSM2 Solr class then uses Solr 's Java client , SolrJ , to take the documents created by the OSMHandler SAX parser and sends them in batches to the Solr server .
You can run the Driver class on your own using the command line , or you can simply run ant index and Ant will do the necessary work to run the driver .
When you are done , point your browser at http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=*:* and verify that Solr found 68,945 documents .
Take a moment to peruse the returned results and familiarize yourself with the content .
I have only scratched the surface of the myriad of ways you could slice and dice the OSM data , but it is time to move on to discuss how to leverage this data in an application .
Searching by location
Now that I have data in the index , it 's time to revisit the different ways to use it .
Namely , I am going to demonstrate how to sort , boost , and filter documents based on spatial information in the index .
Distance - related calculations
Boosting and sorting documents by distance is a common requirement for many spatial applications .
To that end , Lucene and Solr come with several capabilities for calculating distances ( see Related topics ) .
Lucene includes tools for sorting and filtering based on the great circle ( Haversine ) formula ( see DistanceUtils and DistanceFieldComparatorSource ) , while Solr has several Function Query functions for calculating distances , including :
Great circle ( Haversine and Geohash Haversine )
Euclidean and Squared Euclidean
Manhattan and other p-norms
Boosting by distance is quite easy using Solr 's distance functions .
I 'll focus on Solr 's function queries because they are the easiest to use and require no programming to leverage , but they can easily be used in or ported to Lucene .
As I showed earlier , I have several fields set up to store OSM data , including lat / lon , lat_rad / lon_rad , and geohash .
I can then search and boost on these values :
hsin ( great circle ) : http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=name:Minneapolis AND _val_ :" recip ( hsin( 0.78 , - 1.6 , lat_rad , lon_rad , 3963.205 ) , 1 , 1 , 0 ) " ^100
( great circle ) : dist ( Euclidean , Manhattan , p- norm ) : http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=name:Minneapolis
AND _val_ : " recip ( dist ( 2 , lat , lon , 44.794 , - 93.2696 ) , 1 , 1 , 0 ) " ^10 0
( Euclidean , Manhattan , p- norm ) : 0 sqedist ( Squared Euclidean ) : http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=name:Minneapolis AND _val_ :" recip ( sqedist ( lat , lon , 44.794 , - 93.2696 ) , 1 , 1 , 0 ) " ^100
( Squared Euclidean ) : ghhdist ( Geohash Haversine ) : http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=_val_:" recip ( ghhsin ( geohash ( 44.79 , - 93 ) , geohash , 3963.205 ) , 1 , 1 , 0 ) " ^100
In each of these cases , I 've combined a keyword query with a distance - based Function Query to produce a result set that factors in both the keyword score and the distance score .
To see the effect of each of these parts , add an &debugQuery=true onto each query and take some time to examine the explanations produced by Solr .
These are just examples of their usage .
To see the full signatures and documentation for these and other Function Query functions , see Related topics .
Of course , you may choose to boost one part over the other , or otherwise change the calls to fit your needs .
As for sorting by distance , Solr offers one primary option , which really is a bit of a workaround to the fact that Solr does not yet have sort - by - function capabilities and the fact that no custom FieldType s are defined at this point .
However , the workaround is simple .
To sort by function , create your query as above , but zero out , via boost , the keyword clause , as in q=name : Minneapolis^0 AND _val_ :... .
This will cause the keyword score to be zero ( but the matching documents will still be returned ) and the function value to be the sole component of the score .
Longer term , look for Solr to add FieldType s for better support of sorting without needing to zero out the main query .
With the sorting and scoring out of the way , it 's time to move on to filtering .
Filtering
To filter by location with Solr , the three primary mechanisms in Table 1 are available to application writers for restricting the document space :
Table 1 . Approaches to filtering
Filter approach Description Example Range Create a range filter that encompasses the lat / lon of the bounding box .
For performance reasons , it is important to use the TrieField ( NumericField ) capabilities of Solr with this approach .
http://localhost:8983/solr/
select/?q=*:*&fq=lon:[-80 TO - 78 ] &fq=lat :[ 31 TO 33 ]
Cartesian tier Given a lat / lon and a distance , identify the grid cells surrounding the center point and restrict to only those documents containing those cells .
See What 's a QParserPlugin ? for more details on the source implementation of this .
http://localhost:8983/solr/
select/?q=*:*&fq={!tier x=32 y= - 79 dist=50 prefix=tier_} Distance Using Solr 's frange ( function range ) QParserPlugin capability and a distance function ( more in Distance - related calculations , above ) , determine the distance between the points and restrict the document space .
http://localhost:8983/solr/
select/?q=*:*&fq={!frange l=0 u=400}hsin( 0.57 , - 1.3 , lat_rad , lon_rad , 3963.205 )
A few words on density
The density of data in a specific range often plays an important role in the user search experience .
For example , an application providing business search for Manhattan in New York , N.Y. is much denser than one providing results for Buffalo , Minn . ( see Related topics ) .
In fact , it can be useful to incorporate this information into your filtering function such that the application picks an effective distance to ensure good results .
Unfortunately , demonstrating how to do this is beyond this article 's scope .
Which approach is right for you ?
It will depend on the density of your points ( see A few words on density ) , but a good recommendation is to start off with the simple range approach and then move up to the tier approach if need be .
The key factor is to look at the number of terms that need to be evaluated at any one time when calculating the range , because that number is what directly controls how much work Lucene must do in order to restrict the result set .
A simple geonames.org query parser
Building a full - fledged query parser for spatial is beyond the scope of this article .
Instead , I 'll build a simple QParserPlugin that will handle the chores of obtaining results from location information from GeoNames .
This parser assumes that an application can split up the user input ahead of time into two parts : the keyword query and the spatial query .
In fact , many local search applications ask the user for input in just this way via two input boxes .
What 's a ?
A QParserPlugin is Solr - speak for a query parser plug - in module .
Just as many pieces of Solr are pluggable , so to are query parser implementations .
For this article , I am using three different query parser plug-ins , one that comes with Solr — FunctionRangeQParserPlugin ( {! frange} ) — and two I wrote : CartesianTierQParserPlugin ( {! tier} ) and the GeonamesQParserPlugin .
The source for the two plug-ins is located under the src tree in the sample download .
Both plug-ins are already configured in Solr via the solrconfig.xml file : QParserPlugin s are invoked in the query by specifying {! parserName [ parameters ] }[ query ] , ( parameters and query may be optional ) , as in {! tier x=32 y= - 79 dist=50 prefix=tier_} and {!
frange l=0 u=400}hsin( 0.57 , - 1.3 , lat_rad , lon_rad , 3963.205 ) .
The parser can take several parameters :
topo : Short for toponym ( see the GeoNames documentation ) .
The location to search for in GeoNames .
Required .
: Short for toponym ( see the GeoNames documentation ) .
The location to search for in GeoNames .
Required .
rows :
The number of rows to get back from GeoNames .
Optional .
Default is 1 .
: The number of rows to get back from GeoNames .
Optional .
Default is 1 . start :
The result to start on .
Optional .
Default is 0 .
: The result to start on .
Optional .
Default is 0 . lat :
The latitude field name to use as a ValueSource for the FunctionQuery .
If specified , lon must also be set .
: The latitude field name to use as a for the .
If specified , must also be set .
lon :
The longitude field name to use as a ValueSource for the FunctionQuery .
If specified , lat must also be set .
: The longitude field name to use as a for the .
If specified , must also be set .
gh :
The Geohash field name to use as a ValueSource for the FunctionQuery .
If specified , lat / lon must not be set .
: The Geohash field name to use as a for the .
If specified , / must not be set .
dist :
The distance function to use .
String .
One of [ hsin , 0 - Integer . MAX_VALUE , ghhsin ] .
If a geohash field is specified , then this field is disregarded and ghhsin is automatic .
Default is 2 for the 2 - norm ( Euclidean ) .
: The distance function to use . .
One of .
If a field is specified , then this field is disregarded and is automatic .
Default is 2 for the 2 - norm ( Euclidean ) .
unit - KM|M : The units to use , KM for metric , M for English .
Default is M .
: The units to use , for metric , for English .
Default is .
boost - float :
The amount to boost the function query by .
Default is 1 .
The code for this example is in GeonamesQParserPlugin.java in the sample download .
( The Solr server is already configured in the Solr version included in the download . )
Invoking it is much like invoking the CartesianTierQParserPlugin outlined above .
For instance , to search for malls in the index relative to Bloomington , Minn. , I did http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=text:mall AND _query_ : " {! geo topo= ' Bloomington , MN ' lat=lat_rad lon=lon_rad dist=hsin} " .
By taking the QParserPlugin approach , I was able to focus in on handling just the specific syntax that was important to me while location - wise still allowing all the text - based query parsing capabilities to proceed as usual .
From here , the GeonamesQParserPlugin could be expanded significantly to work with postal codes and many other location specifications .
Naturally , it also needs more error handling and likely needs to be converted to use the GeoNames dataset ( see Related topics ) so that it does n't rely on Web services calls .
Solr also has an open issue in its issue tracker for adding spatial query parser support ( see Related topics ) .
Where to next ?
I 've demonstrated Lucene and Solr 's capabilities for searching , sorting , and filtering text documents based on a point - based model of location .
From here , a real local - search application will need to investigate how best to scale , handle user queries , and visualize the results .
For scaling , some of the question is answered by how many terms need to be enumerated when the bounding - box filter is created .
Beyond the filter question for scaling , the usual search - related factors will apply , such as whether to distribute the index or simply replicate .
See the Lucene and Solr Related topics .
If you are interested in building out a more significant GIS application , you will need to add much more sophisticated capabilities for route finding , shape intersection , and a great deal more .
But if you need to build out a solid search application that combines the structure of point - based locations with unstructured text , then look no further than Lucene and Solr .

The biggest waves in the Pacific Northwest are getting bigger .
So are the smaller waves .
A new assessment of offshore data from Oregon and Washington finds the annual average heights of deep - water waves have increased since the mid-1970s — with both the low waves of summer and the highest storms waves of winter growing yearly .
Consequently the 100 year wave for this region just grew form a 33 - foot wave to a 46 - foot wave : a 40 percent rise .
Furthermore , the really highest waves possible in the 100 - year - event cycle are likely to rise above 55 feet , according to research published in Coastal Engineering .
Worse , the impacts of these storm waves will dwarf the impacts expected from sea level rise in coming decades .
I wrote about this phenomenon in MoJo ’s All the Disappearing Islands in regards to the people of the Pacific islands nation of Tuvalu .
Long before they ’re actually drowned , low - lying islands and coastlines will become uninhabitable from periodic inundation by storm waves .
In the Pacific Northwest , increasing wave heights have already wrought three times more havoc from erosion , flooding , and coastal damage than is expected from sea level rise in the next few decades .
Add sea level rise to growing wave heights you get a seriously accelerated impact on coastlines .
The most likely cause ?
Global climate change , say the researchers — who note similarly rising wave heights in the North Atlantic , plus a rising in the total power generated by hurricanes yearly .
So for those who think a 1.5 - degree F global temperature rise is inconsequential , here are a few of the deadly inconsequences .
* Gates pleads the case for public health
* Health spending would help environment , Gates says
SEATTLE , Jan 24 ( Reuters ) - Bill Gates , the world ’s richest man and a leading philanthropist , said on Sunday spending by rich countries aimed at combating climate change in developing nations could mean a dangerous cut in aid for health issues .
Gates , the Microsoft Corp MSFT .
O co-founder whose $ 34 billion foundation is fighting malaria , AIDS , tuberculosis and other diseases in developing countries , expressed concern about the amount of spending pledged at December 's Copenhagen global climate meeting .
Participants at the meeting agreed to a target of channeling $ 100 billion per year to developing countries to combat climate change by 2020 .
Gates said that amount represents more than three quarters of foreign aid currently given by the richest countries per year .
“ I am concerned that some of this money will come from reducing other categories of foreign aid , especially health , ” Gates wrote in a letter , released late on Sunday , describing the work of his foundation .
“ If just 1 percent of the $ 100 billion goal came from vaccine funding , then 700,000 more children could die from preventable diseases , ” Gates added .
Taking the focus away from health aid could be bad for the environment in the long run , said Gates , “ because improvements in health , including voluntary family planning , lead people to have smaller families , which in turn reduces the strain on the environment . ”
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , which he runs with his wife Melinda and father William Gates Sr. , had an endowment worth $ 34 billion as of September .
Gates , 54 , remains Microsoft chairman but focuses his attention on his foundation .
Since starting in 1994 , the foundation has handed out more than $ 21 billion in grants .
Gates said he was worried generally about levels of government aid from rich countries to poor countries slipping with tough economic conditions globally .
“ Because of budget deficits , there is significant risk that aid budgets will either be cut or not increase much , ” Gates said in his letter .
He singled out Italy for criticism .
“ Italy was at the low end of European givers even before the Berlusconi government came in and cut the aid by over half , making them uniquely stingy among European donors , ” Gates said .
According to Forbes magazine , Gates was the richest man in the world in 2009 with an estimated fortune of $ 40 billion .

A Turkish man has decided to divorce his wife after DNA tests showed he was the father of only one of their twin boys .
The Turkish daily newspaper Sabah reported the security guard from Istanbul , identified only as A.K. , had DNA tests done on the three - year - olds after becoming suspicious his wife had been unfaithful .
The tests established with a 99.99 per cent certainty that the man was the father of only one of the boys , adding that the result was confirmed by a forensic medicine institute upon the request of the court handling the divorce case .
The mother , identified as C.K. , had maintained a relationship with a lover she had dated before her family forced her to marry A.K. , the newspaper said .
The phenomenon of twins with different fathers - known as heteropaternal superfecundation - is very rare in humans but more common in animals such as cats and dogs .
It becomes possible in rare circumstances when a woman produces two ova in a menstrual cycle , said Professor Rusen Aytac , head of the gynaecology department at Ankara University 's medical faculty .
A.K. kept the boy he had fathered and disowned the other one , who ended up in a state care institution , Sabah said .
C.K. , for her part , has received death threats both from her own and her husband 's family , and secured a court order preventing relatives from coming within 500 metres of her , it added .
UPDATE : Congressional Democrats , with the apparent blessing of President Barack Obama , are looking at pushing through a scaled - down version of the health reform bills that they think may pass Congress in the wake of their loss of a filibuster - proof supermajority , news reports say .
The Associated Press reports :
A simpler , less ambitious bill emerged as an alternative only hours after the loss of the party ’s crucial 60th Senate seat forced the Democrats to slow their all - out drive to pass Obama ’s signature legislation despite fierce Republican opposition .
The White House is still hoping the House can pass the Senate bill in a quick strike , but Democrats are now considering other options .
ADVERTISEMENT
Politico reports that President Barack Obama is “ calling for a quick consensus behind popular elements of the reform plan , ” but adds that the White House “ has n’t gravitated fully to the stripped - down bill as the only path to saving reform . ”
The White House ’s stripped - down plan would include provisions such as tighter insurance regulations and moderate coverage expansions , according to Democratic officials .
But it would amount to a major retreat from Obama ’s initial vision of near - universal coverage … .
Original story follows below
WASHINGTON —
In a stunning interview given to ABC News to be broadcast Thursday night , President Barack Obama all but conceded his signature legislative issue .
“ Here ’s one thing I know and I just want to make sure that this is off the table :
The Senate certainly should n’t try to jam anything through until Scott Brown is seated , ” Obama told the network , according to a partial transcript .
“ The people of Massachusetts spoke .
He ’s got to be part of that process . ”
Waiting for Brown will all but doom the Democrats ’ health care package .
Brown would be the 41st Republican vote in the Senate , ensuring the opposition party has enough votes to mount a filibuster .

“ Here ’s my assessment of not just the vote in Massachusetts , but the mood around the country : the same thing that swept Scott Brown into office swept me into office , ” the president added .
“ People are angry , they are frustrated .
Not just because of what ’s happened in the last year or two years , but what ’s happened over the last eight years . ”
“ I would advise that we try to move quickly to coalesce around those elements in the package that people agree on , ” he said .
The president reiterated the principles behind his pursuit of reform in the interview .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We know that we need insurance reform , that the health insurance companies are taking advantage of people , ” he said .
“ We know that we have to have some form of cost containment because if we do n’t , then our budgets are going to blow up and we know that small businesses are going to need help so that they can provide health insurance to their families .
Those are the core , some of the core elements of , to this bill . ”
Obama also discussed some regrets from his first year in office .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If there ’s one thing that I regret this year , is that we were so busy just getting stuff done and dealing with the immediate crises that were in front of us , that I think we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the American people about what their core values are and why we have to make sure those institutions are matching up with those values , ” he said .
“ What [ people ] ’ve ended up seeing is this feeling of remoteness and detachment where , you know , there ’s these technocrats up here , these folks who are making decisions , ” he added .
“ Maybe some of them are good , maybe some of them are n’t .
But do they really get us and what we ’re going through ? ”
He pledged to make a more concerted effort to communicate and connect with the American people henceforth .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ And I think that I can do a better job of that and partly because I do believe that we ’re in a stronger position now than we were in a year ago . ”
Brown ’s election has brought about a major rift between Senate and House Democrats , neither of which agree about how to proceed on health care .
The simplest path for Democrats to enact the legislation now is to have the House of Representatives approve the bill that the Senate passed last month , as GOP Senator - elect Scott Brown intends to deny them the final vote they need for cloture .
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) said on Wednesday the Senate will not take any major action on health reform before Brown assumes office , according to Reuters .
ADVERTISEMENT
Senate Democrats are telling their House colleagues to accept their bill , because it wo n’t survive another vote in the Senate .
“ I think at this point , given the new senator from Massachusetts ’ position , I think that that would be tough to do , ” Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - MI ) told Talking Points Memo‘s Brian Beutler .
Sen. Patty Murray ( D - WA ) agreed that health reform now rests in the House ’s hands .
“ I think so , ” she said .
So far there appears to be no serious discussions in among the Democratic leadership about using budget reconciliation , a process that would allow the bill the upper chamber to pass with a 51 votes .
ADVERTISEMENT
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) , who suggested reconciliation as an option for health care just months ago , did not immediately respond to a question by Raw Story regarding whether it ’s being considered .
Making matters more complicated is that several House Democrats do n’t appear to believe the Senate bill has the votes to pass the House .
Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - NY ) and Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) have both signaled that the House will turn it down .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ’s ( D - OH ) office confirmed to Raw Story on Wednesday he will not vote for the Senate bill .

Sorry , guys !
SEOis often said to be closer to an art than to a scientific subject , especially as it changes so quickly .
Because of the relative opaqueness of Google 's search process , the frequency of its algorithm updates and the large number of variables involved , there 's also an element of serendipity .
Historically , some techniques have given SEO a bad name , but there are several simple ways to ensure your site benefits from natural search results - and this guide can act as a basic checklist .
Save time and money by getting a tailored quote
We work with industry - leading providers to match your requirements with their products .
Just tell us what you need from your SEO tool , software or service , and our most suitable partners will contact you to see if you want to take things forward .
1 . Enter your details below .
Simply tell us a bit about what you want from your product / service , and leave some contact details .
2 . We search our database .
We ’ll match your requirements with the services and prices that our partners offer .
3. Partners will contact you .
Only the suppliers who match your requirements will reach out to you .
What are organic results ?
Search can be classified as either organic ( natural ) or paid .
Organic ( natural ) results are those that occur naturally in search engine results pages ( SERPs ) and high results depend on both the technical construction of your site and the content within it .
Paid results , often referred to as Pay Per Click or PPC , can quickly deliver the results site owners pay for , and usually appear above organic listings .
Research shows web users prefer organic listings to paid listings , considering them more relevant and trustworthy .
The goal of SEO , then , is to improve your organic listings performance , which in turn should boost traffic to your site .
Search engines index the web using large clusters of computers that use computer programmes , known as bots , to spider the web by following links found on web pages .
These URLs are populated into the search engine indexes and it's this index that 's queried every time a user performs a search .
Search engines employ complex mathematical equations , known as ranking algorithms , to order search results .
Google 's algorithm ( Pagerank ) alone relies on more than 200 individual factors to decide which result , in which order , to return to its web searchers .
Organic SEO can be further split into two categories .
On - page :
The code and content you use to manage and deliver your web pages .
Off - page : External factors effecting SEO .
This is primarily focused around link building – getting other websites to link to your content .
Here we 'll focus on basic on - page optimization methods , which are all under your control .
How one massive English news website got nuked by Google In June 2019 , Mailonline , one of the world 's largest news websites , saw its traffic halved overnight after Google posted one of its core algorithm update core .
The drop was so significant that the site 's SEO director , Jesus Mendez , made the setback public on Google 's own webmasters forum .
This is in stark contrast with the fortunes of many of its competitors which , according to an independent search analyst , saw their Google visibility go up .
9 steps to success
To make sure your website is accessible to search engine spiders , follow these simple steps :
1 . The most important thing is to maximize accessibility to ensure search engines can find all your content .
You can help Google out by providing a sitemap file ( called sitemap.xml ) that lists all of your content and how often it 's updated .
Visit the Webmasters webpage to provide Google with this information .
The other is to wait for search engines to find it through links to you from other sites ; this normally happens during their crawling process and usually takes longer .
2 . Ensure you 're not preventing the search engines indexing your site with use of a robots .
txt file from The Robots Exclusion Protocol , which is used to give instructions to search engine bots .
More information on this can be found here .
3. Duplicate pages are a bad thing , and making pages that specifically detect the Googlebot ( Google 's web - crawling tool ) and serve up something designed for it is an absolute no - no .
Eliminate duplicate content .
This could be caused by the way your server is set up or how your CMS serves up content , but either way , this needs to be addressed .
4 . If you 're using a CMS such as WordPress , it 's worth having it create static versions of pages where possible .
It 's not crucial – Google can handle dynamic pages these days – but it does n't hurt .
This text version makes it clear what 's being used to figure out your site 's content .
5 . Where possible , it 's also preferable to have permalinks like '/ products/fridges/dynatech-coolfreezepro/ ' for pages , rather than addresses that end with things like '? page=42132 '.
Every scrap of data you give the crawler will boost your chances in search results .
6 . Ensure you have a clear internal linking architecture .
Promote important content to the homepage and link to key site sections via dedicated navigation .
Group content into clear site sections reflected in your site navigation to aid both users and search engines .
For example :
www.mysite.com/ /news / products / category - 1 / category - 2 / blog / about / contact
7 . As far as raw content goes , the most important thing is that your site uses the keywords that people search for .
Ensure your content is machine - readable , and avoid using video or imagery to exclusively house your content .
Remember , search spiders cannot see images or video : they can only read written text on a web page .
Content in frames , videos , pictures , pulled from Twitter or generated on the fly can be left out .
8 . Ensure you 're targeting the appropriate keywords for your business objectives .
Just as successful advertising campaigns contain content that appeals to a target demographic , successful websites need to focus on keywords that have the highest relevance to their target audience .
9 . After that , the challenge is to get good links to boost your authority and there 's entire industries ( Outreach , PR etc ) that are dedicated to doing just that .
Getting links from high authority domains ( websites with high Pagerank ) is the ultimate goal .
Time to call an SEO expert ?
These are straightforward tips and while SEO may seem pretty simple , it is now far more complex that it has ever been even if you focus on only one search engine .
As a business owner , it does make sense to focus on your core competencies and enlist an expert , either a practitioner or an agency , to help you out planning your site 's SEO .
Just be careful who you take onboard though .
Genuine SEO experts will have use cases and examples to showcase their achievements .
They will offer a comprehensive , logical and results - based plan that takes into consideration all the aspects of a website ( including social networking and email marketing ) .
Just beware of so called Black Hat SEO ( as opposed to White Hat SEO ) ; they may claim to make you reach Google 's first page for a fee .
Never be tempted to pay for dodgy tricks and just ask them instead why they do n't do it for themselves .
In almost all cases , they do n't work , will only send worthless traffic rather than actual readers , and could well come back to bite you later on when Google catches up ( as it always does )
Much as exercise and a good diet are the only way to lose weight , good content is the only true way to achieve a good Google rank .
I ’m not going to say much about this video below , except to say that we need to have less of these types of power plants .
Coal proponents will point out that much of the steam you see in the video is in fact mostly H20 .
What ’s frightening is all of the arsenic , lead , mercury , nitrogen , nitrogen oxides , sulfur oxides , and coal ash that you do n’t see being released into the air and into underground water supplies .
I ’m not even talking about carbon dioxide or the environmental devastation of mountain top removal that decimates pristine habitats and leaves the world that much uglier .
Reminds me of that Joni Mitchell song , “ They paved paradise and put up a parking lot . ”
It ’s been a little over a year since the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash spill in December of 2008 , but please do n’t forget it .
Sadly , that spill was just the tip of the iceberg .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , there are 584 more hazardous coal ash dump sites located in 35 states .

I know the above video and related news sucks , but do n’t just stick your head in the sand !
You ’re not powerless .
You can do something .
At the very least , you can reduce your energy needs with quick , cheap , energy efficiency measures .
That ’s number one .
Second , you can consider solar and get a free estimate of your costs .
Depending on your state and utility , you could be cash positive the first month .
But you ca n’t know that unless you get a quote .
And it ’s free , so what can it hurt but a little bit of time ?
Finally , you can share this post with friends by email , Face Book , Digg or any other social networking site .
That will help others to think about steps they can take too .
Just take one step !

Cricklewood , located in the northern reaches of London ( the borough of Barnet to be precise ) , is a thriving area of the city , with ample retail areas such as Cricklewood Lane and Cricklewood Broadway .
Aside from its thriving retail element , Cricklewood doubles up as a residential area .
In the early 2000s , sightings of a large cat like creature were proved true when a collective residential effort resulted in a senior veterinary officer of the London Zoological Society sedating the animal with a tranquilizer gun .
It turned out to be a lynx that had been prowling the area for over ten years .
This lynx is not the only wild cat to have called Cricklewood its home though .
The escorts Cricklewood calls its own are notorious for their adventurous streaks and love of satisfying customers .
Consistently gorgeous , these girls are one of the most talked about things in Cricklewood at present .
Each escort Cricklewood calls its own is adept in the art of pleasing customers .
Many hire these girls to help them unwind after a long day at work , and are often amazed at how much fun a Cricklewood escort can help them have when they have put up with an entire day of mediocre company and conversational pleasantries .
Many prefer taking their Cricklewood escorts to one of the restaurants , bars or clubs around the area , or perhaps even further afield .
And these gorgeous girls are only too willing oblige .
The escorts in Cricklewood are so well practiced at satisfying clients that their reputation is now spreading across London like wildfire .
Many come visiting the area to see if the rumours of exquisite services from utterly stunning escorts is true , or just too good to believe .
And one hundred percent of these curious visitors leave Cricklewood as satisfied as the residents with the quality of escorts the area offers .
Home to many prestigious hotels and plenty of transport links , many visitors are so taken by the escorts that they end up staying an extended period of time , perhaps to get to know one particular escort very intimately , or perhaps to sample a range of Cricklewood escorts .
So schlecht war das Jahr gar nicht .
Gut , es brachte ein " Zugangserschwerungsgesetz " , Arbeitnehmerüberwachung dank " Elena " und spitzelnder Konzernchefs .
Außerdem Datenschutzabkommen mit den USA , die den Namen nicht verdienen , und diverse Lecks , Affären und Skandale .
Doch gab es auch mehrere Urteile , Demonstrationen und Entscheidungen , die hoffen lassen und vor allem eines zeigen : Dass Datenschutz ein wesentliches Recht darstellt , ist in den Köpfen der Menschen angekommen .
Gleichzeitig begannen 2009 wichtige Debatten .
Beispielsweise darum , wie in unserer technisierten Zukunft Begriffe wie Privatsphäre und Neutralität definiert und gewährleistet werden können .

Und wer Demokratie als ständigen Prozess des Aushandelns und Ringens begreift , für den war 2009 ein großes Jahr .
Facebook , Google " Street View " , Scoring , Wahlcomputer , Vorratsdaten – immer wieder zeigte sich , dass Protest und Debatten nicht sinnlos sind , dass sie zu Veränderungen führen können .
Die mögen im Einzelnen kleiner sein als erhofft , auch kleiner als eigentlich notwendig , doch umsonst ist der Einsatz für informationelle Selbstbestimmung und Datenschutz offensichtlich nicht .
Der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte Peter Schaar hat einmal gesagt , Datenskandale hätten auch etwas Gutes : Sie erhöhten das Bewusstsein für den Datenschutz .
Nach dieser Auffassung war 2009 ein prima Jahr .
Schon 2008 hatte es bei einem Großunternehmen eine Riesensauerei um Daten gegeben .
Die Telekom hatte eingeräumt , Mitarbeiter und Journalisten bespitzelt zu haben .
2009 dann musste auch die Deutsche Bahn zugeben , es mit der Überwachung ein wenig übertrieben zu haben .
Im Januar gesteht man nach Medienberichten , Kontoverbindungen von ungefähr 1000 leitenden Mitarbeitern seien geprüft worden , um Korruption erkennen und bekämpfen zu können .
Anfangs scheint die Konzernführung gar nicht zu begreifen , warum sich irgendjemand darüber erregt .
Bahnchef Hartmut Mehdorn erklärt mehrfach , das Vorgehen sei international üblich und datenschutzrechtlich überhaupt kein Problem .
Als er kurz darauf eingestehen muss , dass die Bespitzelung nahezu jeden Mitarbeiter der Bahn betraf , in Einzelfällen bis tief ins Privatleben reichte und von obskuren Firmen vorgenommen wurde , muss Mehdorn – zu seiner eigenen Überraschung – letztlich gehen .
Im März tritt er zurück .
Im Oktober zahlt der Konzern außerdem ein Bußgeld von 1,12 Millionen Euro .
Die Telekom - Affäre ist auch noch nicht ausgestanden .
Ebenfalls im März bekommen Ex- Telekom - Aufsichtsratschefs Klaus Zumwinkel und der früheren Telekom - Vorstandschefs Kai-Uwe Ricke zu Hause Besuch von Ermittlern .
Bei so viel Aufregung geht nahezu unter , dass andere Konzerne ebenso eigenmächtig mit dem Leben ihrer Angestellten umgehen .
So hat auch Airbus heimlich nachgeschaut , ob die Kontonummern von 20.000 Beschäftigten identisch sind mit denen von Zulieferern .
Und Schmuddelkind Lidl – 2008 hatte man mit Kameras und Detektiven seine Mitarbeiter ausgespäht – lässt gar geheime Krankheitsdossiers über Angestellte anlegen .
Der Deutschlandchef tritt daraufhin zurück .
Doch 2009 wurde nicht nur gespitzelt , sondern auch in riesigem Umfang gestohlen .
In den USA werden drei Männer angeklagt , weil sie sich Daten von insgesamt 130 Millionen Kreditkartenkunden verschafft hatten .
Zuvor hatte es die Jobbörse Monster.com erwischt .
4,5 Millionen Datensätze waren dort von Hackern entwendet worden .
In Deutschland tauschen die Banken im November immerhin Hunderttausende Kreditkarten aus .
Die Finanzhäuser befürchten , dass deren Daten bei einer Abrechnungsfirma gestohlen wurden .
Ungenehmigte Abflüsse gab es noch mehr in diesem Jahr .
Dank unsauberer Programmierung war es eine Zeit lang möglich , Profile von Nutzern bei SchülerVZ , bei der Sparkasse und bei libri.de einzusehen .
Die Politik gibt sich jedes Mal schockiert und kündigt strengere Gesetze an .
Bislang ohne größeres Ergebnis .
Auch Schaars Forderungen nach mehr Kompetenzen und Sanktionsmöglichkeiten bleiben bislang ungehört .
Die politische Entwicklung geht 2009 eher in eine andere Richtung : Auch der Staat würde gern mehr überwachen , was seine Bürger so treiben , und diese Erkenntnisse mit möglichst vielen teilen .
Die größte Debatte beschäftigt sich 2009 dabei mit dem Thema Kinderpornografie .
Doch nicht um die Kinder geht es dabei , sondern darum , dass die Internetseiten , auf denen sie als Opfer zur Schau gestellt werden , gesperrt werden sollen .
Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen möchte gern ein entsprechendes Gesetz schaffen .
Im April verpflichtet sie per geheimer Verträge schon einmal die Internetprovider , dabei mit dem Bundeskriminalamt zu kooperieren .
Politisch scheint das Vorhaben anfangs am Widerstand in Parlament und Öffentlichkeit zu scheitern , letztlich jedoch verabschiedet der Bundestag im Juni nach namentlicher Abstimmung das " Zugangserschwerungsgesetz " .
Dass einer der lautesten Gegner , der SPD - Mann Jörg Tauss , wegen des Besitzes und der Verbreitung von Kinderpornos angeklagt wird , beschleunigt Leyens Fortschritt dabei nicht unerheblich .
Für SPD und Grüne ist die ganze Debatte eine Belastungsprobe .
Der neu gegründeten Piratenpartei dagegen verhilft sie zu einem Mitgliederboom .
Nicht das letzte Projekt , mit dem die Bundesregierung die neue Netzbewegung zu fördern scheint .
Elena beispielsweise hat viel Potenzial , Datenschützer zu verärgern .
Denn der " Elektronische Entgeltnachweis " verpflichtet Arbeitgeber , Informationen über ihre Mitarbeiter an ein zentrales Verzeichnis der Deutschen Rentenversicherung weiterzugeben .
Darunter Streikbeteiligungen , Fehlzeiten oder Kündigungsgrund .
Aus dem unbürokratischen Service ( Eigenwerbung ) wird so ein veritables Überwachungsinstrument .
War noch was ?
Richtig , der Bundestag hat im Juli auch ein neues Datenschutzgesetz beschlossen .
Im Vergleich zu den ursprünglich von Innenminister Wolfgang Schäuble vorgelegten Entwürfen aber ist es eher ein Witz .
Zwar müssen , bevor mit ihren Adressen gehandelt werden darf , die Betroffenen nun grundsätzlich zustimmen .
Doch darf diese Zustimmung noch immer im Kleingedruckten versteckt werden .
Ein generelles Verbot solcher Adresslisten , wie anfangs diskutiert , wurde von der Verlags - und Direktvermarkterlobby so lange bekämpft , bis es kippte .
Zwei Monate zuvor , im Mai , hatte der Bundestag schon einmal am BDSG ein wenig herumgeändert und damit das Scoring – nein , nicht verboten , nicht einmal erschwert , sondern lediglich versucht , es transparenter zu machen .
Zumindest für jene , die wissen , dass es solche Bewertungen über sie gibt .
Eine Pflicht , Betroffene über ihren Score zu informieren , existiert darin nicht .
Auf europäischer Ebene gab es noch bedenklichere Entwicklungen .
Vor allem zwei Begriffe sorgten in den vergangenen Monaten für Aufregung : Swift und ACTA .
Das sogenannte Swift - Abkommen gestattet den USA Zugriff auf sämtliche Überweisungsdaten , die innerhalb der EU anfallen .
Diesen Zugriff hatten amerikanische Terrorfahnder bislang auch schon , weil eines der Rechenzentren in den USA stand .
Doch statt sich darüber aufzuregen , hat die EU das Ganze nun mit einem Abkommen legalisiert .
Der neue deutsche Innenminister Thomas de Maizière spielte dabei eine unrühmliche Rolle .
Durch ein Nein hätte er den Vertrag verhindern können .
Doch trotz erheblicher Bedenken enthielt er sich und winkte ihn damit durch .
ACTA hingegen wurde gleich ganz hinter verschlossenen Türen verhandelt .
Irgendwie geriet auch die leichtere Verfolgbarkeit von Tauschbörsen - Nutzern in dieses Handelsabkommen – sehr zur Freude der Unterhaltungsindustrie .
Sie wollen auf der Grundlage von ACTA künftig Filesharer aus dem Netz schmeißen und ihnen den Zugang abklemmen .
Diese Themen sorgen 2009 in ganz Europa für Debatten .
Auf europäischer Ebene ist die Grundlage dafür bereits gelegt .
Frankreich hat ein entsprechendes Filesharing - Jäger - Gesetz ( loi Hadopi ) gar schon verabschiedet , Großbritannien plant es , und in Deutschland hätte man es eigentlich auch gern .
Die Industrie kämpft vehement dafür , wird aber im Zweifel wohl am Bundesverfassungsgericht scheitern .
Hoffentlich zumindest , beschädigt der Kampf gegen Filesharer doch schon jetzt demokratische Grundwerte .
Daneben ist eines der wichtigsten Themen in diesem Jahr wohl die Vorratsdatenspeicherung gewesen .
Mehr als 10.000 Menschen demonstrieren im September in Berlin dagegen und gegen das Ausspähen ihrer Privatsphäre .
Fast 35.000 Menschen hatten 2008 eine Verfassungsklage gegen das Gesetz eingereicht .
Die Angst davor ist groß , nicht zu Unrecht .
Unterstützung bekommen die Gegner vom Bundesverfassungsgericht .
In einer Eilentscheidung wurde das Verfahren 2008 wenigstens eingeschränkt und während der mündlichen Verhandlung ließen die Richter starke Zweifel an der Rechtststaatlichkeit erkennen .
Kleinere Siege erreichen Datenschützer auch gegen Google .
Der Dienst Street View des amerikanischen Konzerns muss sich deutschem Datenschutzrecht beugen und das Webseitenwerkzeug Analytics möglicherweise ganz verschwinden .
Als Erfolg gilt auch der Widerstand gegen die iranische Regierung mithilfe von Blogs und Twitter .
Auch wenn er das Regime nicht stürzen konnte , belegt er doch die Macht , die diese Technik bietet .
Freie Rede und freies Twittern als Waffe .
Nicht umsonst gilt den Befürwortern daher die Netzneutralität als Kernproblem der nahen Zukunft .
Und die amerikanische Medienaufsichtsbehörde FCC erregte viel Aufmerksamkeit , als sie von Providern forderte , alle Daten müssten gleich behandelt werden .
Einen Beleg für die Macht des Netzes wollen auch die Parteien im Bundestagswahlkampf liefern und ganz viele Unterstützer dort rekrutieren .
So richtig aber funktioniert das nicht .
Zu spät und zu inkonsequent sind die Versuche , Communitys aufzubauen .
Was war noch ?
Amazon löscht ein bereits verkauftes Buch von den Kindle - Readern seiner Kunden – sinnigerweise auch noch " 1984 " von George Orwell , Facebook ändert seine Einstellungen für die Privatsphäre und will damit 300 Millionen Menschen ins Netz scheuchen , und Stromfirmen basteln an schlauen Stromzählern , Smart Meter genannt , um noch viel mehr über ihre Kunden erfahren zu können .
Im März stoppt das Bundesverfassungsgericht den Einsatz von Wahlcomputern .
Seine Stimme einem Computer zu übergeben , ohne sehen zu können , was dann damit passiert , verstoße gegen den Grundsatz der Öffentlichkeit der Wahl , heißt es in dem Urteil .
Auch wenn zwei Millionen Menschen bei der Bundestagswahl 2005 so ihre Stimme abgaben , muss sie nicht wiederholt werden .

I love to listen to great developers talk about how they write software .
If you like the same thing , then you should check out Coders at Work by Peter Seibel .
Peter rounded up some amazing folks from the software development world to interview , like Jamie Zawinski , Guy Steele , Ken Thompson , Peter Norvig , and the ultimate shot caller himself , Donald Knuth .
I continue to find must - read passages in this book , like this selection from Peter 's interview with Guy Steele .
Guy Steele , of course , did hugely important work on Emacs , Scheme , Java , and Common Lisp .
I love how he correlates the edge cases of fairy tales and software .
Guy Steele :
And I think that the other problem is that people like to focus on the main thing they have in mind and not worry about the edge cases or the screw cases or things that are unlikely to happen .
And yet it is precisely in those cases where people are most likely to disagree what the right thing to do is .
Sometimes I 'll quiz a student , " What should happen in this case ? "
" Well , obviously it should do this . "
And immediately someone else will jump in and say , " No , no , it should do that . "
And those are exactly the things that you need to nail down in a programming specification of some process .
I think it 's not an accident that we often use the imagery of magic to describe programming .
We speak of computing wizards and we think of things happening by magic or automagically .
And I think that 's because being able to get a machine to do what you want is the closest thing we 've got in technology to adolescent wish - fulfillment .
And if you look at the fairy tales , people want to be able to just think their minds what they want , waive their hands , and it happens .
And of course the fairy tales are full of cautionary tales where you forgot to cover the edge case and then something bad happens .
Peter Seibel : Fantasia and the perils of recursion , of course .
GS : Fantasia and recursion , yes .
Or , " I wish I was the richest man in the country " - well , that makes everybody else extremely poor and you 're the same as you were before .
That kind of thing happens in fairy tales because people forget that there 's more than one way to do something .
And if you just think about your main wish and do n't think about the details , that leaves a lot not tied down .
PS : So the lesson from fairy tales is that the Gandalfs of the world got there by hard labor , learning the incantations , and there 's no shortcut to that ?
GS : Yeah .
I 've never seen anyone make an analogy between these two bodies of work before , but we often do find ourselves creating software as if we were in the a fairy tale , paying little attention to what could go wrong .
The entire book is loaded with great , insightful stuff like this .
I encourage everyone to check it out .
Renewable energy has got buzz , growth and growing government support .
But it ’s no secret that it still makes up a small portion of the overall energy mix .
As interest in renewables increases , the question has begun coming up more and more often :
When will renewable energy companies catch up to conventional energy companies ?
That is , when will we see an Exxon Mobil Corp. , Chevron Corp. or ConocoPhilips of renewables ?
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. brought more attention to this question with his prediction , repeated over the last several months , that clean energy would overthrow energy incumbents within the next decade .
“ We ’re going to democratize the energy system in this country and take it away from the incumbents over the next 10 years , ” he said at the Solar Power International conference in Anaheim last October .
As a new year — and new decade — begins , many hope it will launch a new era of growth and profit for renewable energy after a year of financial suffering .
It ’s also a time when companies , as well as individuals , traditionally take stock of where they are and set new goals and resolutions .
So it seems like a fitting time to examine this question and take a look at various predictions of when this might happen .
Total Energy
One of the most obvious ways to attempt to answer the question is by looking at how much of the world ’s energy comes from renewables today .
According to the International Energy Agency ’s World Energy Outlook in 2008 , renewables made up 18 percent — or 3,470 terawatt hours — of the global electricity generation in 2006 , with most of that coming from hydroelectric and wind power .
In the same report , the agency forecast renewable - electricity generation would overtake natural gas , becoming the world ’s second - largest source of electricity after coal , “ soon after 2010 . ”
According to those predictions , renewables are on track to account for 4,970 terawatt hours in 2010 and more than 7,700 terawatt hours , or 23 percent of the global electricity production , in 2030 .
That expected growth might have been slowed by financial difficulties this year .
According to the 2009 World Energy Outlook , investment in renewables - based power generation “ fell proportionately more than that in other types of generating capacity ” in late 2008 and early 2009 .
The report forecast that investment in those projects may have declined by nearly one - fifth this year , and would have dropped by almost 30 percent without government stimulus packages worldwide .
Even if renewables do still overtake natural gas by 2015 , that is n’t an apples - to - apples comparison as it compares all types of renewable electricity , including hydro , wind , solar and more , to only one type of fossil fuel .
Looking at the numbers for just one type of renewable energy , such as solar , for example , shows renewables are far behind in total production .
Adam Krop , vice president for equity research at Ardour Capital Investments , said his company estimates that solar will likely only be about 1 percent of the total global electricity generating capacity for the foreseeable future — and that ’s an aggressive target .
In the United States , which is a small solar market today , solar electricity accounts for only 0.01 percent of the total , he said , but could grow to 0.5 percent by 2020 .
“ Growing from 0.01 percent to 0.5 percent still represents rapid growth , but growing to the size of conventional energy companies is not likely , ” he said .
As independent analyst Peter Lynch puts it , “ If the solar industry doubled every year for the next 20 years , it would n’t even be a significant number . ”
Meanwhile , an early release of this year ’s U.S. Department of Energy ’s International Energy Annual forecasts that the electricity generated from renewables worldwide will match that of natural gas in 2015 , but sink slightly below it through 2030 ( see chart here titled “ Figure 6 : World Electricity Generation by Fuel ” ) .
Renewables make up a much smaller portion of the total energy ( not just electricity ) usage , however .
According to the report , renewables made up only 41.5 quadrillion
Btu of the total world energy consumption compared with 28.5 quadrillion Btu for nuclear , 115.5 quadrillion Btu for natural gas , 136 quadrillion Btu for coal and 175.2 quadrillion Btu for liquids , including biofuels .
Profits and Revenues
But finding a single company large enough to rank among the energy majors is n’t the same as comparing global energy output or usage .
A common way of determining the size of a public company is its market capitalization , or the total value of all the shares owned by investors .
Ardour ’s Krop pointed out that at $ 323.72 billion as of Dec. 31 , Exxon Mobil ’s market cap is still 28 times larger than that of First Solar , the largest stock in his solar group , at $ 11.52 billion .
It ’s also 26 times larger than Danish wind company Vestas Wind Systems ’ market cap of 64.57 billion kroner , or $ 12.47 billion .
“ My sense is that my solar group will not likely approach conventional energy company size in the foreseeable future , ” he said .
Another way to compare renewable - and conventional - energy companies is through their revenues and profits .
Let ’s compare Vestas , the largest pure - play wind - turbine manufacturer , to Exxon Mobil , which sits at the very top of the Fortune 500 .
Exxon Mobil saw its revenue grow 18.8 percent to a whopping $ 442.851 billion last year as its profit grew 11.4 percent to $ 45.22 billion .
Meanwhile , Vestas saw its revenue grow 24 percent to € 6.03 billion last year — valued at $ 8.51 billion at the time of its annual report , according to Hoover ’s Inc. — while its profit grew 75.6 percent to € 511 million .
If Vestas continued to grow at exactly the same annual rate , which is unlikely , it would catch up to Exxon Mobil ’s 2008 revenue in 18.7 years , and reach its profit in seven and a half years .
( In dollar terms , revenue grew only 18.9 percent to $ 8.51 billion in 2008 from $ 7.15 billion in 2007 , according to Hoover ’s .
At that rate , it would take 23.3 years .
But the discrepancy has to do with exchange rate differences , so we ’ve instead compared euros to euros above . )
But unsurprisingly , Vestas ’ growth has slowed in 2009 .
In the first nine months of 2009 , the company reported € 4.13 billion in revenue , up 16.2 percent from € 3.55 billion in the same period the previous year , and € 264 million in profit , up 35.4 percent from the first nine months of 2008 .
According to its guidance , Vestas anticipates revenue of € 7.2 billion for 2009 , which would represent growth of 19.4 percent .
Of course , this is a simplistic way of looking at this question , as the growth of renewable energy is n’t linear .
Many as - yet - unknown factors play into the equation .
For example , government incentives and other policies play a huge role in determining the market for renewable energy today , as well as the price of renewable projects compared to the ever - changing price of the traditional energy it might be competing with .
“ Until the industry can get along without government incentives , it will be at the mercy of how government incentives are structured , ” said Alfonso Velosa , a research director at Gartner Inc .
He pointed to the consequences of the Spanish feed - in tariff , which more than quadrupled the country ’s solar market to 2.5 gigawatts in 2008 only to cut the program to 500 megawatts in 2009 , leading to an oversupply of panels and shrinking panel prices globally .
Infrastructure challenges such as electrical transmission or biofuel distribution , as well as the need to figure out how to smooth and control the intermittent electricity from sources such as solar and wind , also stand in the way , he said .
Financing for these projects will also likely need to improve before a renewable company will reach the Fortune 500 .
“ Financing is the No. 1 concern for any renewable - energy project ; it goes hand in hand with finding a customer , ” Velosa said .
Companies that help arrange financing for their customers , such as SunPower Corp. , which offers power - purchase agreements through financing partnerships with the likes of Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo , could have a big advantage , he said , adding that he expects to see more companies get into financing .
All together , Velosa said , he expects to see world - scale renewable - energy companies emerge in 15 to 20 years .
Independent analyst Peter Lynch also forecasts it will take at least 10 years — and potentially “ decades , ” as fossil - fuel companies continue to receive subsidies and government support far beyond renewables — to see companies at that size .
Shares and Returns
From an investor perspective , what matters most is n’t a company ’s market cap or energy output , but the potential returns — or growth in share price — which depends , in part , on anticipated future revenue and profit .
As Lynch pointed out , “ Investors could care less which company is bigger , but care instead which company is going to grow the most , ” he said .
“ Solar companies are going to grow a heck of a lot faster [ than conventional energy companies ] .
They have potentially far greater room to grow ; therefore , their stocks probably have equally greater potential to grow . ”
It ’s easier to invest in solar than in wind because the sector has far more pure play companies , or “ more items on the menu , ” he said .
For example , GE is a big player in wind power , but has so many other businesses that the wind part of the company does n’t drive the stock .
“ You do n’t buy GE because they have a good wind turbine , ” Lynch said .
Solar stocks dramatically outperformed the market in 2005 , 2006 and 2007 , although they fell way down in 2008 , he said ( see chart on returns , below ) .
Lynch predicts that solar will be the fastest - growing segment of the energy industry , with returns exceeding those in oil and gas , but does n’t expect solar companies ’ market caps will overtake those of the oil and gas giants .
Not all renewable - energy sectors perform similarly , though .
He pointed out that biofuel stocks are down 50 to 80 percent over the last three years .
Short Answer : In a Long Time
From all of these different angles , it ’s obvious that renewable energy companies are a long way from catching up with fossil - fuel energy industry giants .
In addition to all the above - noted variables , David Jones , editor of the Platts Renewable Energy Report , said he does n’t expect to see a renewable - energy company on the Fortune 500 until governments set a market price on carbon emissions .
“ Until that takes place , companies and other organizations will naturally release carbon because it does n’t cost anything , ” he said .
“ Once a price gets put on those emissions , renewables will be much more competitive . ”
Europe already has a carbon emissions trading program , and the United States also is considering one in several proposed climate bills .
In addition , Jones said prices need to keep coming down to make renewable energy affordable for the majority of customers , and the industry needs to grow large enough so that renewable energy is accessible as an everyday option for most people .
“ I think there will be a time when utilities automatically add [ a green power ] option on their bills . ”
Consumer awareness and marketing is another big factor .
“ What you ’re going to need is some sort of consumer revolution in which renewable energy becomes a standard feature of energy generation , ” he said .
“ It ’s got to be in the consumers ’ interest beyond trying to make a difference . …
It has to be really attractive to people as a product . ”
Overall , with a worldwide market , Jones said its always possible renewables could see explosive growth — and in fact solar is already becoming mainstream in some markets — but added that he’d be very hard pressed to predict a year — or even a decade – when a renewable company will reach that size .
“ In a nutshell , it ’s going to take a while , ” he said .
Manufacturers of smaller - scale systems that are mass - produced and sold in large volumes to consumers are most likely to get to the Fortune 500 , he predicts .
Still , keep in mind that looking at the state of pure play renewable companies hardly tells the whole story of the success and growth of clean energy .
After all , many existing energy companies , including oil companies and major utilities , are getting involved in renewable energy , and Gartner ’s Velosa said he expects that trend to keep growing .
BP Solar , for example , has some advantages — such as experience in the energy industry , a familiarity of the market dynamics involved , the relationships and the ability to get financing — from its parent company , he said .
And even though wind may make up a small part GE , the company is a major player in the sector .
Velosa expects to see large energy - generation and –distribution companies get more involved in renewables , leading to more mergers and acquisitions and other impacts .
“ Global companies are very interested in this because they see a market segment that has higher growth than the overall energy industry does , ” he said .
In other words , the next BP of renewables could be BP .
And of course , a spot on the Fortune 500 is n’t the only measure of success .
Dan Adler , director of the California Clean Energy Fund , said while he wants the renewable industry to be huge and profitable , his gut reaction to the question of when renewable - energy companies would catch up to conventional energy players was “ hopefully never . ”
He would like to see the renewable industry retain a larger number of players rather than the few energy giants that exist in oil , gas and coal today .
While oil companies , for example , have to be big because oil ’s so expensive to produce and oil resources are more centralized , one of the goals — and strengths — of renewable energy is its diversity and the ability to distribute its production , Adler said .
“ The nature of the technology does n’t require the kind of scale and vertical integration [ of oil companies ] , ” he said .
“ If we start to see a lot of consolidation , we may be moving away from that strength . ”

Reporters ( Mostly ) Barred From Tea Party Convention
Created : January 12 , 2010 10:04 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
For a while , I ’ve been calling and emailing the organizers of the National Tea Party Convention with some basic logistical questions , to no avail .
Kevin Diaz explains why : the convention , held in Nashville next month , will be closed to all but “ selected ” members of the press .
Organizers say that journalists without passes will not be allowed into the convention at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel .
( A Star Tribune request for a pass was denied , the paper ’s interest in covering its home - state congresswoman notwithstanding ) .
Convention spokesman Judson Phillips informs us that most of the sessions are closed “ at the request ” of the presenters .
“ Given the media interest , I do n’t want the sessions disrupted and overrun with the media , ” he said .
This really is unusual .
As a journalist , I ’ve been allowed into sessions , dinners , everything at conferences hosted by the Eagle Forum and by Focus on the Family .
Extra credit to Eagle Forum here — when I was covering the How to Take Back America Conference in St. Louis , Phyllis Schlafly ’s son Andy , an organizer , invited me away from my media seat and into a seat at his dinner table to chat with more activists .
And some of the most controversial speakers at the National Tea Party Convention , like Rick Scarborough , happily chatted with me inside and outside of their sessions at previous events .
One major implication of this , of course , is that for the third time since the presidential election — the first at a speech in China , the second at a speech for a pro-life group in Indiana — Sarah Palin will give a political speech that members of the media are not allowed to attend .
According to co-sponsors I ’ve spoken with , they , not journalists , will get to spend time with Palin before and after the speech .
UPDATE : Here ’s the rejection email .
Thank you for your inquiry about media coverage of the First National Tea Party Convention in Nashville .
This is a working convention and the sessions will not be open to the press .
We are planning two events that the media could have access to .
Neither has been finalized .
One would be on Friday and the other would be on Saturday .
We have a very limited number of press passes and they have been accounted for .
Press without a pass will not be allowed into the convention area .
If you want to interview any of our speakers , please let me know and we will try to work that out .
Governor Palin will not be available for interviews .
If you wish to interview someone about the convention , please email me , Judson@Teapartynation.com and I will try to work out arrangements for that .
He ’ll try !
AT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration , here is a candidate : within the next few months women will cross the 50 % threshold and become the majority of the American workforce .
Women already make up the majority of university graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional workers in several rich countries , including the United States .
Women run many of the world 's great companies , from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France .
Women 's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our times .
Just a generation ago , women were largely confined to repetitive , menial jobs .
They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to abandon their careers when they married and had children .
Today they are running some of the organisations that once treated them as second - class citizens .
Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives .
And millions of brains have been put to more productive use .
Societies that try to resist this trend — most notably the Arab countries , but also Japan and some southern European countries — will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent and frustrated citizens .
This revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction ( see article ) .
Men have , by and large , welcomed women 's invasion of the workplace .
Yet even the most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory .
This particular advance comes with two stings .
The first is that women are still under - represented at the top of companies .
Only 2 % of the bosses of America 's largest companies and 5 % of their peers in Britain are women .
They are also paid significantly less than men on average .
The second is that juggling work and child - rearing is difficult .
Middle - class couples routinely complain that they have too little time for their children .
But the biggest losers are poor children — particularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of female participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money on child care .
Dealing with the juggle
These two problems are closely related .
Many women feel they have to choose between their children and their careers .
Women who prosper in high - pressure companies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then find it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum .
Less - skilled women are trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand - to - mouth child - care arrangements .
Motherhood , not sexism , is the issue : in America , childless women earn almost as much as men , but mothers earn significantly less .
And those mothers ' relative poverty also disadvantages their children .
Demand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems .
Even if some of the new theories about warm - hearted women making inherently superior workers are bunk ( see article ) , several trends favour the more educated sex , including the “ war for talent ” and the growing flexibility of the workplace .
Law firms , consultancies and banks are rethinking their “ up or out ” promotion systems because they are losing so many able women .
More than 90 % of companies in Germany and Sweden allow flexible working .
And new technology is making it easier to redesign work in all sorts of family - friendly ways .
Women have certainly performed better over the past decade than men .
In the European Union women have filled 6 m of the 8 m new jobs created since 2000 .
In America three out of four people thrown out of work since the “ mancession ” began have been male .
And the shift towards women is likely to continue : by 2011 there will be 2.6 m more female than male university students in America .
The light hand of the state
All this argues , mostly , for letting the market do the work .
That has not stopped calls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort .
Norway has used threats of quotas to dramatic effect .
Some 40 % of the legislators there are women .
All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state - financed nurseries .
They have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of the social problems that plague Britain and America .
Surely , comes the argument , there is a way to speed up the revolution — and improve the tough lives of many working women and their children ?
If that means massive intervention , in the shape of affirmative - action programmes and across - the - board benefits for parents of all sorts , the answer is no .
To begin with , promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and unfair , and stigmatises its beneficiaries .
And there are practical problems .
Lengthy periods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women , which helps explain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a lower proportion of women in management than America does .
But there are plenty of cheaper , subtler ways in which governments can make life easier for women .
Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at home .
They need to change the way they operate .
German schools , for instance , close at midday .
American schools shut down for two months in the summer .
These things can be changed without huge cost .
Some popular American charter schools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays .
And , without going to Scandinavian lengths , America could invest more in its children : it spends a lower share of its GDP on public child - care than almost any other rich country , and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid maternity leave .
Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric about “ real family values ” .
Still , these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that women have made in recent decades .
During the second world war , when America 's menfolk were off at the front , the government had to summon up the image of Rosie the Riveter , with her flexed muscle and “ We Can Do It ” slogan , to encourage women into the workforce .
Today women are marching into the workplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining glass ceilings .
The Vancouver Canucks took advantage of a shaky goaltending situation Saturday to end a three - game losing streak .
They can possibly do the same on Wednesday , which would send their opponent to a ninth straight loss .
That 's because the Canucks are visiting an Edmonton Oilers outfit missing its starting goaltender and currently on a dismal 1 - 14 - 1 run — including an eight - game losing streak .
Vancouver ( 28 - 18 - 2 ) hosted the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins on the weekend , who were starting their illness - ridden third - string goalie and had a 19 - year - old backup just signed to a tryout contract .
The Canucks predictably lit up both netminders on the way to a 6 - 2 win .
Edmonton is without Nikolai Khabibulin , who will have back surgery to repair a herniated disc and is expected to be out for about three more months .
Now the Oilers ( 16 - 27 - 5 ) , who are last in the Western Conference and 29th in the NHL , have to rely on the already - shaky tandem of Jeff Deslauriers and Devan Dubnyk for the forseeable future .
Neither goalie is making a case for the starting job while Khabibulin is out .
Deslauriers is 1 - 10 - 1 in his last 12 games with a 3.87 goals - against average , while Dubnyk is 0 - 4 - 0 with a 4.09 GAA in six starts .
Deslauriers and the rest of the Oilers were left with another bad taste in their mouths after they were spanked 6 - 0 by Colorado on Monday .
Teeth knocked in
" I wo n't be flashing my teeth , because I think they just got kicked in , " Edmonton coach Pat Quinn said after the loss .
" After a game like that you 're pretty discouraged .
There were a lot of people that did n't compete very well . "
It marked the first time the Oilers lost eight in a row since a 12 - game slide back in March 2007 .
It 's mostly good news on Vancouver side of things .
Pavol Demitra finally made his season debut for the Canucks on Saturday , and Ryan Johnson could be back in the lineup tonight .
Steve Bernier is also close to returning , meaning coach Alain Vigneault will have some roster decisions to make soon .
Defenceman Willie Mitchell wo n't play Wednesday after getting slammed headfirst into the boards by Evgeni Malkin late in the game against Pittsburgh , and is doubtful for Thursday 's game against Dallas .
" They say they watch every game so I 'm sure that they 've seen that hit , " Vigneault said .
" We 'll leave it up to them to decide if something needs to be done . "
The Canucks find themselves in a dogfight for the playoffs , sitting in sixth in the West but only two points clear of ninth .
With a brutal road schedule coming up before and after the Olympic break in February , Vancouver is going to need all the healthy bodies it can get .
Injuries slamming Oilers
Along with Khabibulin , the Oilers continue to miss the services of Ales Hemsky , out for the season with a shoulder injury , and Mike Comrie , who 's been out two months with mononucleosis .
Gilbert Brule ( knee ) , Ryan Stone ( illness ) , and Steve Staios ( concussion ) have also missed time .
Expect a big night Wednesday out of Vancouver 's Henrik Sedin .
The NHL 's leading scorer is at his best against the Oilers , with 46 points in 55 games , his highest point production against any club .
Linemate Alex Burrows has continued his hot string of play with another goal during the Penguins victory , and now has 11 in seven games .
Patrick O'Sullivan has the hot hand in Edmonton , with four points in his last four games .
Both teams face Dallas next .
The Canucks host the Stars on Thursday , while the Oilers do the same Friday .
The October 3 , 2005 issue of Fortune magazine carries a “ wall street : special report ” called “ The Money Game ” by Marcia Vickers .
This details the investment strategies of David F. Swensen and Jack R. Meyer , who managed the endowments of Yale and Harvard , respectively .
While most mutual funds that pick stocks underperform indices , both schools have consistently earned a much better return than the stock indices .
How did they do it ?
Below are their allocations .
Note that Harvard ’s total is 105 percent because of leverage , i.e. , situations in which they ’ve borrowed money to purchase investments .
Conspicuously absent from these portfolios are heavy investments in American companies run by Harvard and Yale graduates .
“ Domestic Equity ” are publicly traded stocks such as GE and Microsoft .
Harvard and Yale have faith that their graduates will make a lot of money for themselves , but no faith that they will make money for their shareholders .
