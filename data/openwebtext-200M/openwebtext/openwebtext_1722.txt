There is a " coherent and significant connection " between radiation from Vatican Radio aerials and childhood cancer , researchers have said .
The Italian experts looked at high numbers of tumours and leukaemia in children who live close to Vatican Radio transmitters .
The 60 antennas stand in villages and towns near Rome .
The Vatican said it was astonished and would present contrary views to a court in Rome .
Italian courts have been investigating for 10 years whether of an abnormally high number of deaths from cancer among families living near the aerials just north of the Italian capital can be attributed to electromagnetic radiation .
The 300 - page report , ordered by the courts and carried out by Italy 's most prestigious cancer research hospital , now concludes that there is a connection between radiation and the cancer incidents .
Obsolete
Some 60 huge steel aerials were erected on farmland owned by the Vatican during the last century .
They transmit Vatican Radio programmes around the world on medium and short wave .
However , the technology is now largely obsolete , as Catholic radio stations in many countries rebroadcast Vatican Radio shows after picking them up on the Internet .
In one court case against the Vatican the statute of limitations ran out , but another case is still pending .
The Vatican says it intends to defend its position and claims there is no threat to public health through its transmissions .
The World from Berlin ' Belgrade Must Rethink Its Destructive Kosovo Policy '
Thursday 's ruling by the International Court of Justice offered surprising clarity : Kosovo did not break international law when it declared indepedence in 2008 .
German commentators acknowledge that this is a blow for Serbia , but many see an opportunity for Belgrade to reassess its stance towards Pristina .
The fight to stop whaling has been boosted with new research showing the southern ocean sperm whale can remove large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere .
A study has found that instead of increasing carbon levels through respiration , the sperm whale offsets its emissions by defecating .
Flinders University researcher Trish Lavery says the poo is rich in iron , which stimulates phytoplankton to grow , and that traps the carbon dioxide .
" They 've certainly gone past the carbon - neutral status that we all attain to and they 're actually sinking more carbon from the atmosphere each year into the deep ocean ... than what they add to the atmosphere when they respire , " she said .
" It 's just like manuring your garden .
When these sperm whales defecate on the phytoplankton , that causes them to grow and bloom , and like all plants they take in carbon when they grow .
" This carbon build - up is certainly another unexplored facet of whaling .
If we had n't decreased sperm whale populations from their historical levels , we'd have an extra about two million tonnes of carbon being pulled out of our atmosphere every single year and being sunk to the deep oceans . "
According to this research , the whales can remove about 400,000 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere each year , more than double the amount they add , making the sperm whale a carbon - neutral mammal .
A separate study at the Australian Antarctic Division in Hobart this year found that whale faeces could be crucial in reducing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide .
I do n’t know if you guys know this , but guys in the 70s wore speedos to the beach .
I decided to bring this style back to the gulf coast .
The feeling of empowerment was overwhelming .
Yes , 70 ’s Big gives you wings .
When wearing a speedo , I spent most of my time above ground .
As you can see , it was liberating .
Power…elegance …grace .
Perfection .
This one ’s kinda impressive .
I ’ll need an FAA license the next time I try it .
On Thursday a tidbit of news circulated around the Web that Microsoft had filed a patent application in late 2009 hoping to lay claim to the look and feel of page turns on a touchscreen device .
The patent application states that when “ one or more pages are displayed on a touch display ” a “ virtual page turn curls a lifted portion of the page to progressively reveal a back side of the page while progressively revealing a front side of a subsequent page . ”
Just like real pages in a paper book .
Many bloggers speculated that if Microsoft is awarded the patent for page turns , Apple would have to remove , or license , the interface technique it currently uses in its iBooks application .
But the page turn does n’t necessarily make sense in digital form and seems to be an unnecessary and archaic carryover from print .
Of course many might disagree with me on this : it is a topic of debate among fans of user interface design and digital books .
Jason Kottke , blogger and Web designer , had this to say about the iBooks page turn :
The page flipping animation in the iBooks app though ?
Super cheesy .
It ’s like in the early days of cars where they built them to look like horse - drawn carriages .
Ca n’t we just scroll ?
Craig Mod , a book designer , also noted earlier this year that the page turn is something of a relic :
“ The metaphor of flipping pages already feels boring and forced on the iPhone . ”
The Design blog Design Dare takes the opposite approach , defending the page turn if it ’s executed correctly .
The author writes that page flips on digital devices need to be extremely fast , not too fanciful and easy to execute .
So what ’s better than a page flip ?
Ironically , it could be the page scroll , an interaction that was essentially eliminated when long print scrolls were replaced centuries ago by bound books .
Before I started writing for the Bits blog I worked at The Times as a user interface specialist , exploring interaction designs for reading digital text on e-readers .
After a number of design experiments and mock - up concepts I found that the page turn served one purpose : to remind readers of the printed page while they use a digital screen .
But it was n’t necessarily the most efficient way to read long - form text .
After a while , the digital page flip can seem annoying and inefficient .
In the end some of the best results came from scrolling through content , where the reader ’s eyes do n’t have to adjust to the page , but instead the page adjusts to them .
This post has been updated to clarify that Microsoft filed a patent application , not a patent .
A section of the M7 near Newport in Co Tipperary , which collapsed earlier this year
A MAJOR operation is under way to finish a section of a busy motorway after part of the road collapsed into a bog .
Road authorities last night confirmed that the final section of the Limerick to Nenagh bypass would be completed by the end of the year .
The € 425 m road -- which was due to open last year -- will link the Limerick southern ring road with the Nenagh bypass .
The construction of the 38 km road from Annacotty to Nenagh , Tipperary , was contracted to Bothar Hibernian almost four years ago and was due for completion in May 2009 .
Difficulties
However , the contractors ran into serious difficulties at Anaholty bog , where the almost - completed road collapsed earlier this year .
It is understood that thousands of steel - reinforced concrete piles were driven into the bog to support the sinking road .
But following the collapse of the road surface , a concrete and steel bridge is to be constructed over the entire area in the hope of establishing a stable base for the road .
The National Roads Authority ( NRA ) says the final section of the Limerick - to - Nenagh road will open by the end of the year .
" We are being reassured by the contractor that the project will be completed by the end of the year , but this is a design - built contract so any of the costs incurred due to difficulties with the Anaholty bog is borne by the contractor , " an NRA spokesman said .
" We are obviously disappointed ( with the delay ) as we would liked to have seen the public benefit sooner , but obviously the contractor is dealing with a difficult situation . "
Limerick County Council said it was satisfied that the contractor was dealing with the difficulties as best it could .
But a spokesman for the council stressed that the contract company must itself address any difficulties that arise during the construction of the motorway .
" Under the terms of the contract between Limerick council and Bothar Hibernian , any issues arising from the construction of the motorway are to be addressed by the contractor in question , " he said .

HOUSTON / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - BP
Plc said on Wednesday it was starting to reinstall an oil - siphoning cap on its blown - out well in the Gulf of Mexico after an earlier disruption unleashed a torrent of crude .

“ Operations have now begun to reinstall the cap , ” the British energy giant said in a statement .
Oil gushed largely unchecked from the well on Wednesday after an undersea robot collided with a system intended to capture some of the crude from the worst spill in U.S. history .
While BP struggled to restart its oil collection operation , the U.S. government said it would impose a more flexible ban on new deepwater drilling after a federal judge overturned an initial moratorium as too far - reaching .
Oil companies , trying to stop the government from keeping the ban in place , swiftly returned to court to ask the judge to enforce his ruling , accusing the Obama administration of choosing to “ ignore and disobey it . ”
The government imposed a six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling after an offshore rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers and rupturing BP ’s well .
The White House plans to appeal the ruling .
Washington is taking a tough line on other fronts as well .
The House of Representatives agreed on Wednesday to give subpoena power to the commission created by President Barack Obama to investigate the spill .
In another development , Kenneth Feinberg is stepping down from his role as U.S. Treasury ’s “ pay czar ” later this summer to focus on administering BP ’s $ 20 billion oil spill fund , a Treasury spokesman said on Wednesday .
After siphoning off a record amount of oil from the well the day before , BP suffered the setback when an undersea robot crashed into the containment cap system that channels leaking oil to a ship from the well on the seafloor .
The containment cap system installed on June 3 captured 16,600 barrels on Tuesday , BP said .
A separate oil - flaring system that collected 10,5000 barrels is still operating .
A team of U.S. scientists estimate the leak is spewing between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day .
The massive oil slick has shut down rich fishing grounds , killed hundreds of turtles and seabirds and dozens of dolphins and soiled the coastlines of four U.S. states .
OIL COATS PENSACOLA BEACH
Florida saw its worst effect yet from the spill as thick oily sludge washed ashore on Pensacola Beach .
Emergency workers said the pudding - like mixture covered 3 miles of Pensacola Beach , a barrier island that is part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore .
“ It ’s just a line of black all the way down the beach as far as you can see in both directions .
It ’s ruined , ” said Pensacola fisherman Steve Anderson .
The oil spill prompted the Obama administration to impose the deep - sea drilling ban while it investigated the causes of the accident and set new safety guidelines for offshore rigs .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told a congressional hearing he would reissue the drilling ban blocked by the federal judge but suggested some drilling in proven fields might move forward .

“ We will in the weeks and months ahead take a look at how it is that the moratorium in place might be refined , ” he said .
That would be welcomed by companies like Petrobras and Royal Dutch Shell , which were set to delay major projects on fields that offer the best new source of domestic crude .
Salazar said initial investigations showed evidence of “ reckless conduct ” leading up to the April 20 rig blast , but he did not point the finger at any individual company .
U.S. lawmakers , however , have accused BP of cutting corners and putting cost savings over safety .
BP leased the rig from Transocean and was a part owner in the ruptured well with Anadarko .
INVESTORS TO SUE BP
The criticism has fueled investor fears about BP ’s future and its stock has tumbled since the April 20 spill , losing half its value and trading at levels not seen since 1996 .
New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said on Wednesday the state pension fund planned to sue to recover losses from the drop in BP ’s stock .
Other big U.S. state funds are watching New York ’s lawsuit but have not yet taken legal action .
“ BP misled investors about its safety procedures and its ability to respond to events like the ongoing oil spill and we ’re going to hold it accountable , ” said DiNapoli , a Democrat , who will stand for election in November .
BP ’s share price fall has led some major investors , including Aviva Investors and UBS Asset Management , to start buying again , despite worries about the oil giant ’s total liabilities related to the spill .
Under the Clean Water Act , which levies a $ 4,300 per barrel fine , BP could face penalties of more than $ 15 billion .
That does not include the $ 20 billion compensation fund it agreed to last week or the many billions of dollars in criminal fines that analysts have said are likely .
According to U.S. government estimates , up to 4 million barrels of oil have spewed into the ocean since April 20 , about 15 times as much as was spilled by the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in 1989 .
BP said it has collected about 325,700 barrels so far .
Workers at a bird cleaning facility in Fort Jackson , Louisiana were collecting blood and feather samples as evidence of environmental damage that could be used in possible lawsuits against BP .
About 50 workers removed caked - on crude from pelicans , gulls and other animals with dark , dirty brown feathers .
“ Most spills are over really quick , but this is like a new spill every day .
It ’s really discouraging , ” said Jay Holcomb , director of the International Bird Rescue Center .
Six weeks ago , Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour encouraged people to come visit his state because the oil was n't a threat .
“ The Mississippi Gulf Coast is open for business , ” Barbour said .
“ Enjoy the beach and pay a little sales tax right here . ”
Three weeks ago , Barbour said the oil was " no big deal " and that the real damage was being caused by media coverage of the spill .
" The truth is , " he said , " we have had virtually no oil .
If you were on the Mississippi Gulf coast anytime in the last 48 days you did n't see any oil at all .
We have had a few tar balls but we have had tar balls every year , as a natural product of the Gulf of Mexico .
250,000 to 750,000 barrels of oil seep into the Gulf of Mexico through the floor every year .
So , tar balls are no big deal . " ...
" The biggest negative impact for us has been the news coverage , " Barbour added .
So what does Barbour say now that oil has hit the Mississippi shoreline ?
Naturally , he says the problem is that the Federal government is n't doing enough to stop the oil .
" We continue to press the Federal Unified Command and BP to increase the amount of resources available to attack the oil beginning as far south as possible , through the passes , into the sound , and in the mouths of the bays .
" While command and control of on - water resources has improved , it must get much better , and the amount of resources to attack the oil offshore must be greatly increased .
Under the circumstances , we are taking some of that into our own hands . "
I know you 'll be shocked to learn that Barbour was at a political fundraiser in Washington , DC when he first learned of the imminent threat to the Mississippi mainland .
Drill , baby , drill .
You'd think we'd be totally sick of Samsung 's Galaxy S phones after seeing AT&T's Captivate and Sprint 's Epic 4G , but we 're just not done lovin ' the 4 - inch Super AMOLED , Android devices .
Verizon ' sand T - Mobile 's Vibrant happen to be the last two Sammy phones to jump into our hands - on , but coincidentally , they 're also the most alike .
Design - wise , both remind us of the iPhone 3G / 3GS -- they 're all screen on the front , strikingly thin , and have black shiny backs .
And just like the Captivate and Epic 4G , they 've got four touch sensitive buttons along the bottom edge .
The Super AMOLED screens continue to impress , and watching a clip of Avatar on both versions was pretty breathtaking .
( No , we did n't have an iPhone 4 on hand for comparisons , but make sure to check out the post where we put them head - to - head ) .
We did n't get to put the 1GHz Hummingbird CPU to the test in our short hands - on time , though both Android 2.1 - running phones seemed to perform briskly when opening videos and pulling up the browser .
Beyond Samsung 's TouchWiz skin , both are preloaded with Swype and other carrier apps -- Verizon 's version had Skype Mobile as well as a number of VCAST applications .
Oh , and unlike most of the other Galaxy S phones , the Fascinate had a flash on its backside .
We do n't have much more on these bad boys for now -- we 're still waiting on pricing and availability -- but the pictures and videos after the break should hold you over .

By Jonathan Acuff , Special to CNN
Bono is a born again Christian .
Or he ’s not .
It ’s one of those two .
I ’m just not sure which , but I am certain that the faith of U2 is something we Christians like to argue about .
That and beer .
You never know if your small group is populated with prohibitionists .
You have to say things like , " Is there anything you need me to bring to the dinner party , anything at all ? "
Then if they say , " Sure , how about a bottle of wine ? " you ’re good .
U2 , beer , our favorite pastor ’s kid - gone - wild Katy Perry : these are usually the topics I write about on www.stuffchristianslike.net.
( Which is indeed a direct rip off of the site www.stuffwhitepeoplelike.com.)
But today I thought I might deal with something with a little sharper teeth .
Something you do n’t see addressed often , but you might have experienced .
Put simply , I want to talk about why sometimes we Christians are jerks online .
Much like " Christian hate mail , " being a " Jerk Christian " defies logic .
We serve a loving God .
We follow a Christ who very plainly told us what to do .
In Matthew 22 someone asks Jesus , " What is the most important commandment ? "
The answer is simple :
" Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind . "
This is the first and greatest commandment .
And the second is like it : " Love your neighbor as yourself . "
All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments .
There ’s no confusion about that .
No smoke monster .
No mystical wisdom that must be found on a mountain peak after growing a ZZ Top - worthy beard .
Someone asks Christ what matters and the second thing is " Loving your neighbor as yourself . "
So then why are there so many hateful Christian blogs ?
Why do Christians write bitter messages on Twitter ?
Why do we send hate mail ?
I think there are two reasons Christians are jerks online .
The business traveler approach .
It ’s unfortunately not that uncommon for business travelers to get in trouble when they ’re on the road .
With a " What happens in Vegas , stays in Vegas " approach they tend to do things they would never do at home .
" The rules do n’t apply here .
I ’m a different person .
This is ' road me , ' not ' home me . ' "
I believe sometimes Christians approach the Internet the same way .
The rules of " real life " do n’t count .
Sure , I have to love my neighbor , but are people on Facebook my neighbor ?
The Internet does n’t " count . "
These are just words .
Surely I can throw a missile of hate at someone on Twitter .
And when we buy into this logic , we develop an unloving , anything goes , whatever happens online stays online mentality .
We become two different people , " Offline Christian " and " Online Christian . "
And we become jerks .
Room Cleaning Christianity
Why do Christians argue about drinking beer or why the tankini is the least slutty of all bathing garments ?
I think it ’s because we sometimes practice " Room Cleaning Christianity . "
Think of it like college .
When you ’ve got a final paper due Monday , you will be amazed at how energetic your desire is to clean your room .
You will scrub tile with a slow toothbrush if it means avoiding the bigger , more difficult work of writing your paper .
The same thing happens with Christianity .
Loving your neighbor might be simple , but it ’s not easy .
Maybe my neighbor is a jerk too .
Maybe they hate God .
Maybe they are actively and violently opposed to everything I believe .
And showing them grace feels impossible .
So instead of dealing with that , we get online and police people .
We find small things to focus on that will distract us .
I think God wants us to discuss the little stuff , but we make it an idol when we practice room cleaning Christianity at the exclusion of love .
And we tend to become jerks .
Hopefully you ’ve never experienced either of these things .
Hopefully this article feels like Amish Romance Fiction , currently a hit amongst Christians .
But if it does n’t , if you ’ve been an online jerk , if you ’ve acted like I have , there ’s hope .
Jesus came for the mess - ups like us .
Jesus came for the failures .
Jesus came for the jerks .
( That ’s not in the King James version of the Bible , I remixed it like Timbaland . )
And the truth is , grace is the antidote to being a jerk online .
So my hope is that you wo n’t prove my point in the comments section .
My hope is you ’ll accept my apology for the times I ’ve been a jerk to you online .
My hope is that I ’ll see Bono in heaven , or at the bare minimum " the Edge . "

WINNIPEG , Canada —
World leaders meeting in Canada have been urged to take " inspired leadership and action " to halt poverty , protect the environment , and end violent conflict .
The challenge was made in a statement drafted by representatives of the world 's religions , who gathered at the University of Winnipeg in advance of this week 's G8 and G20 summits in Toronto .
" Acknowledging our common humanity and embracing the imperative to treat all persons with dignity , we affirm that no one person is more or less valuable than another , " said the statement .
" We urge the political leaders to consider first the vulnerable among us , particularly our children , and to work together to address the dehumanizing scourge of poverty and injustice , and practice and promote care for our common environment , the Earth , " the statement said .
The World Religions Summit 2010 was the sixth in a series of interfaith gatherings associated with the annual G8 meetings .
It brought together more than 80 participants from all of the world 's major faiths including , for the first time , representatives of the Baha 'i community .
Religious leaders from more than 20 countries attended , including each of the G8 nations – Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the United States .
The Reverend Dr. James Christie , secretary general of the Summit , said the meeting and its output was directed principally at the leaders of the so - called " Group of 8 " countries because they represent the nations that have the most power to effect change in the world .
" The reality is that these nations have the money , they have the clout , and they make a difference , " said Dr. Christie .
Some participants said it was also important for the religious communities themselves to redouble their own efforts to address the three main topics of their discussions – poverty , the environment , and peace .
" We are living in a very critical period in history , " said His Holiness Aram I , of the Armenian Orthodox Church .
" I believe what is important for us is building community .
It is not just living side - by - side , coexisting peacefully .
It is a question of building integrated communities , communities of integrated diversity , accepting and respecting the others , but living together . "
" We have to tell the G8 and the world that we religions not only speak together but that we are working together to build communities of integrated dialogue , " he said .
Baha'i participation
Among the Baha'i representatives at the Summit was Susanne Tamas of Canada , who was joined by Baha 'is from five other countries - France , Germany , Japan , the United Kingdom , and the United States .
" We believe that spiritual principles need to be brought into the discussion of such challenges as poverty , the environment , and peace and security , " said Ms. Tamas .
" We want to create a space where the political leaders can reflect and make decisions for the long term , and for the common good , rather than on short - term , national concerns . "
" We 're also here to learn – because these issues are complex and we need to learn what other faiths are saying about them , " she said .
As a prelude to the Summit , the Baha 'i community of Canada sponsored a seminar on human rights and religious freedom .
The day - long event – held in Winnipeg on Monday , 21 June – brought together four human rights experts from different religious backgrounds who concluded that the right to freedom of religion must be upheld to ensure that its influence on society is progressive and positive .
" Courageous and concrete " actions
The statement , issued after three days of deliberation at the World Religions Summit 2010 , called upon political leaders to take " courageous and concrete " actions .
Regarding poverty , it said more than a billion people are " chronically hungry " and that women , children and indigenous peoples are among those most affected .
" The magnitude of poverty would be overwhelming were it not for the knowledge that this global inequity can be transformed into a shared life of human flourishing for all .
Together , we have the capacity and the global resources to end extreme poverty and its impacts , " the statement said .
On the subject of the environment , the statement noted that all faith traditions " call us to careful stewardship of the Earth . "
It warned of the effects of climate change and said " bold action is needed now . "
Governments were also called upon to halt the nuclear arms race , and to make new investments to create a " culture of peace . "
The Summit condemned religiously - motivated terrorism and extremism with the faith leaders committing themselves " to stop the teaching and justification of the use of violence between and among our faith communities . "
The statement was presented to Steven Fletcher , Canada 's Minister of State for Democratic Reform .
Mr. Fletcher promised to deliver it to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , for presentation to the G8 leaders .

Broken Bells – “ The Ghost Inside ” ( Feat . Christina Hendricks ) [ Music Video ]
In an absurd intersection of pop culture , Mad Men bombshell Joan Holloway ( Christina Hendricks ) is transported from the nostalgic sixties to a robotic future .
Her intergalactic journey is scored by Broken Bells , the new musical project by James Mercer ( formerly of The Shins ) .
Keep an eye out for the neat cameo of Mercer and his partner - in - crime DJ Danger Mouse .
I ’m excited to see Hendricks getting more exposure outside of Mad Men ; her acting is stellar in the show ( EDIT : to clarify , I had n’t forgotten about Hendricks in Firefly ; I was only referring to her current projects ) .
And while we ’re on the topic of exposure , I should probably mention her curvaceous image has instigated a lot of talk about standards of female beauty .
I , for one , think it ’s great that we have an alternative icon of sexiness beyond stick - thin wafers .

Wes and Tony made a comic then went to the beach and got the authorities called on them for engaging in combat .
The admiral said that a few years ago he led a training exercise on dealing with a major spill of oil resulting from a blown out well .
But that exercise was held in far shallower waters and the simulation prepared for an oil slick that was more compact in character .
“ No one anticipated that this would spread out across such an area ” and involve “ hundreds of thousands ” of patches , he said .
As a result , the Coast Guard has had to recruit a flotilla of volunteers , hundreds of boats that will be equipped with booms and skimming devices , to clean up the scattered oil .
But even skimming operations have to be adapted to the depth of ocean and matched to the kinds of vessels available .
The operation , Admiral Allen said , was “ taxing our resources . ”
In a statement on its Web site , BP said one of four vents on its containment cap had been closed .
When the cap was first lowered last week , the company said it hoped to close all four vents gradually to increase the collection rate .
But a technician involved in the effort said Monday that it was unlikely that the other three vents would be closed  both because the surface ship , the Discoverer Enterprise , was near the 15,000 - barrel limit of the amount of oil it could process , and because of concern that closing more vents would create more pressure that would force the cap off .
Officials say it is not yet possible to gauge what fraction of the total flow is being captured and what fraction is still escaping .
A second system is being prepared that would use the pipes and other equipment installed for the failed “ top kill ” effort two weeks ago to collect oil from the well .
That oil would be siphoned up to a rig , the Q4000 , that is at the site .
The Q4000 is not equipped to separate gas and oil , however , so crews are hurriedly modifying it to do so .
BP officials have said the system using the Q4000 could be ready by next weekend .
At a technical briefing in Houston on Monday , Kent Wells , a senior BP executive , said that next month engineers would replace the cap with alarger device that will make a better seal .
The device , which is currently being designed , would be a " sealing valve , " he said .
It would be connected to a new , floating riser pipe and subsea buoy that would allow collection ships to disconnect and disconnect faster in the event of a hurricane .
Group : Former President Carter could be prosecuted for monitoring fair elections in Lebanon
The US Supreme Court endorsed Monday a broad reading of the law criminalizing “ material support ” to terrorism , a statute that critics argue targets legitimate free speech .
In a six to three vote , the highest US court sided with the government and found that an NGO could face prosecution for providing non-terror - related support , including rights training , to US - designated terror groups .

The case involved the Humanitarian Law Project , a human rights group , which the court ruled could face prosecution under the material support statute for providing human rights or conflict resolution training to groups including the Kurdish PKK or the Tamil Tigers .
“ The material - support statute is constitutional as applied to the particular activities plaintiffs have told us they wish to pursue , ” the court ruling said .
In a press release sent to RAW STORY , the Center for Constitutional Rights argues that the ruling “ criminalizes ” free speech , and that even former President Jimmy Carter could face potential prosecution .
Today , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6 - 3 to criminalize speech in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , the first case to challenge the Patriot Act before the highest court in the land , and the first post - 9/11 case to pit free speech guarantees against national security claims .
Attorneys say that under the CourtÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ruling , many groups and individuals providing peaceful advocacy could be prosecuted , including President Carter for training all parties in fair election practices in Lebanon .
President Carter submitted an amicus brief in the case .
Chief Justice Roberts wrote for the majority , affirming in part , reversing in part , and remanding the case back to the lower court for review ; Justice Breyer dissented , joined by Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor .
The Court held that the statute ’s prohibitions on “ expert advice , ” “ training , ” “ service , ” and “ personnel ” were not vague , and did not violate speech or associational rights as applied to plaintiffs ’ intended activities .
Plaintiffs sought to provide assistance and education on human rights advocacy and peacemaking to the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party in Turkey , a designated terrorist organization .
Multiple lower court rulings had found the statute unconstitutionally vague .
Created in 1996 , the “ material support ” language was strengthened under the Patriot Act , which Congress passed in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 attacks and reauthorized with some changes in 2004 .

It has usually been used to prosecute individuals who have helped organize or finance terrorist attacks .
The law has become a popular tool for prosecutors , who have prosecuted some 150 people under the statute in the United States , obtaining convictions in around 60 cases , and sentences ranging up to life in prison .

In his dissent , Breyer recognized the importance of denying money and other resources to terror groups .
“ I do not dispute the importance of this interest , ” he said .
“ But I do dispute whether the interest can justify the statute ’s criminal prohibition . ”
Breyer said the aid groups ’ mission is entirely peaceful and consists only of political speech , including how to petition the U.N .
“ Not even the ‘ serious and deadly problem ’ of international terrorism can require automatic forfeiture of First Amendment rights , ” he said .
The CCR statement adds :
Said CCR Cooperating Attorney David Cole , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We are deeply disappointed .
The Supreme Court has ruled that human rights advocates , providing training and assistance in the nonviolent resolution of disputes , can be prosecuted as terrorists .
In the name of fighting terrorism , the Court has said that the First Amendment permits Congress to make human rights advocacy and peacemaking a crime .
That is wrong .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Originally brought in 1998 , the case challenges the constitutionality of laws that make it a crime to provide Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ material supportÃ¢â‚
¬Â to groups the administration has designated as Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ terrorist .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â CCRÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s clients sought to engage in speech advocating only nonviolent , lawful ends , but the government took the position that any such speech , including even filing an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court , would be a crime if done in support of a designated Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ terrorist group .
Ã¢â‚¬Â Said CCR Senior Attorney Shayana Kadidal , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The CourtÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s decision confirms the extraordinary scope of the material support statuteÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s criminalization of speech .
But it also notes that the scope of the prohibitions may not be clear in every application , and that remains the case for the many difficult questions raised at argument but dodged by todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s opinion , including whether publishing an op - ed or submitting an amicus brief in court arguing that a group does not belong on the list is a criminal act .
The onus is now on Congress and the Obama administration to ensure that humanitarian groups may engage in human rights advocacy , training in non-violent conflict resolution , and humanitarian assistance in crisis zones without fearing criminal prosecution .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The Court rejected the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s argument that the statute , when applied to plaintiffsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ proposed speech , regulated not speech but conduct , and therefore needed to meet only a low standard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ intermediate scrutinyÃ¢â‚ ¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to survive .
Instead , the Court found that the statute did criminalize speech on the basis of its content , but then found that the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s interest in delegitimizing groups on the designated “ terrorist organization ” list was sufficiently great to overcome the heightened level of scrutiny .
This is one of a very few times that the Supreme Court has upheld a criminal prohibition of speech under strict scrutiny , and the first time it has permitted the government to make it a crime to advocate lawful , nonviolent activity .

The Constitution Project also blasted the court ’s decision in a press release sent to RAW STORY :
Today , the Supreme Court , in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , upheld the extremely broad application of federal laws that prohibit material support for designated terrorist groups .
The lawsuit challenged the application of the “ material support ” laws to organizations and individuals who seek to provide peacebuilding and human rights training to groups designated as terrorist organizations .
Writing for a total of six justices , Chief Justice Roberts today rejected this challenge , finding that the application of the material support statutes to punish these groups ’ pure speech that seeks to further lawful , non-violent ends does not run afoul of the Constitution .
Although the Court agreed that the statute ’s regulation of speech must be subject to a demanding level of scrutiny , the Court found that these sweeping restrictions were justified by the Government ’s interests in combating terrorism .
“ The Constitution Project is thoroughly dismayed by today ’s Supreme Court ’s decision , which will allow for the prosecution of individuals for constitutionally protected , peaceful , speech and association activities , ” said Sharon Bradford Franklin , Constitution Project Senior Counsel .
“ As much as our government must have the tools needed to punish those who work to enable acts of terrorism , it is essential that these laws respect constitutional freedoms .
We regret that the Court refused to rein in the overbroad sweep of the material support statutes to ensure that terrorist activities are prohibited but that free speech and association are still safeguarded by the First Amendment .
Training groups to pursue peaceful resolution of their disputes should be encouraged , not made criminal . ”
Last November , the Constitution Project , together with The Rutherford Institute , filed an amicus brief in the case , urging the Supreme Court to strike down the provisions of the material support laws that conflict with First Amendment protections for free speech and freedom of association .
Also in November , the Constitution Project ’s Liberty and Security Committee released Reforming the Material Support Laws : Constitutional Concerns Presented by Prohibitions on Material Support to “ Terrorist Organizations , ” which proposed eight reforms to remedy serious First , Fourth and Fifth Amendment concerns created by existing material support laws .

The following can be attributed to former President Jimmy Carter , founder of the Carter Center : “ We are disappointed that the Supreme Court has upheld a law that inhibits the work of human rights and conflict resolution groups .
The ‘ material support law ’
Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ which is aimed at putting an end to terrorism Ã¢â‚¬â€œ actually threatens our work and the work of many other peacemaking organizations that must interact directly with groups that have engaged in violence .
The vague language of the law leaves us wondering if we will be prosecuted for our work to promote peace and freedom . ”
The following can be attributed to Melissa Goodman , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project : “ Today ’s decision is disappointing and inconsistent with our First Amendment position .
The government should not be in the business of criminalizing speech meant to promote peace and human rights . ”
( with AFP reports )
Barack Obama flies into the Gulf tomorrow to try to take charge of an environmental disaster that is spreading beyond human control , with a stinking tide of oil from BP 's ruptured well now advancing on the white sand beaches of Alabama and Florida .
Obama 's visit is his fourth since the gusher began , but the first so far to Mississippi , Albama , and Florida , which are now joining Louisiana on the frontline of the spill .
Several miles of Alabama 's beaches were splattered with a thick sludge of oil at the weekend , with a slick now three or four miles off the Florida resort of Pensacola .
Two barrier islands off Mississippi were also covered in oil .
In Panama City , Florida , 190 miles from the ruptured well , a steel tank was discovered , oozing oil , that appeared to come from the sunken Deepwater Horizon rig .
Obama 's two - day visit is the latest attempt by the White House to assert the president 's mastery over the spill crisis – a difficult case to make given that BP and his administration admit the oil will continue to spew until at least August .
He also has a tricky task of balancing public pressure to get tough on BP with economic and diplomatic concerns .
That task will be put to the test on his return from the Gulf with a television address from the Oval Office on Tuesday night , and a meeting with BP 's chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , on Wednesday .
At Alabama 's Orange Beach , at the western edge of a stretch of highrise hotels and condominiums that some call the Redneck Riviera , the oil was washing up in thick lumps faster than the hundreds of cleanup workers could shovel it up .
" This absolutely sucks , " said Carolyn Kerin , coming off the beach with her three children .
None were swimming .
Two red flags were flying , indicating that swimmers would face fines and penalties – not that Kerin would let her children in the water anyway .
" Ewww , " she said .
Was she impressed with Obama 's handling of the crisis so far ?
" I do n't think he did everything he could do .
I think he was way too slow to act like he was serious . "
Further down the beach , opinion was divided .
A man held up a sign for TV cameras reading : " We 've been BPeed on . "
Overhead , a propeller plane flew a banner reading : " Look Obama 54 days and still nothing . "
The summer holidays have just started here and normally the beaches would be a crush of umbrellas and tanned bodies , with traffic jams stretching for miles .
But this weekend , the car parks were packed with pickup trucks and tractors from the cleanup crews .
The sands were mainly empty , barring the workers in their rubber boots and gloves shovelling up the clumps of oil that washed up to 3.5 metres ( 12ft ) up the beach , and dumping the stuff in plastic rubbish bags .
But the oil was landing ashore as fast as they could clean .
A few workers admitted they had cleaned the exact same patch of sand earlier in the day .
" It is a liquid and it is very difficult to pick it up mechanically and pick it up physically , " Alabama 's governor , Bob Riley , told CBS television today .
" We are trying to find something to coagulate it today so we can pick it up . "
Others also had problems to attend to .
At 3 pm yesterday , Judy Robertson was so jittery , walking up to each new arrival to ask if they were with the wedding party she was organising .
The event planner has had three brides cancel – and that was before any of the oil reached the beach .
Now she said she was expecting a wave of lost bookings .
Looking down the beach at a tractor pulling bundled up bags , she said : " My grandkids are not going to know what a beach is if it continues like this .
We are not going to be able to swim here .
It 's going to destroy our economy . "
Robertson , like many of the people in this solidly Republican part of the country , was never a supporter of Obama .
" To me he 's not presidential material , " she said .
Obama 's earlier attempts to show his control over events , including the threat to " kick ass " , may have made Robertson dislike him even more .
" That 's what teenagers say .
It 's not official .
He talks like he 's just some worker on a beach , " she said .
Striking the right balance will be a difficult challenge for Obama during his visit .
This was hostile territory even before the oil spill .
On the ground a lot of people accuse their fellow Americans of rushing to New York 's aid after 9/11 while ignoring hurricane Katrina and this latest tragedy to befall the Gulf .
" It 's like we are Haiti , " said one popular US radio host .
BP is also less than willing to act as Obama 's fall guy .
As preparations got underway for the White House visit the oil company was moving to mollify local opinion , with BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , appearing in local TV adverts to offer a personal apology for the spill .
" The gulf spill is a tragedy that never should have happened , " he said .
" We will get this done .
We will make it right . "
The governors of Mississippi and Alabama want reassurances that Obama will continue to support offshore oil drilling , and are pressing him to end his six - month moratorium on new projects .
Florida 's governor , however , wants the president to introduce an outright ban .
But all three want assurances from Obama that BP will make good on its promise to pay for the spill cleanup and any economic losses .
Such fears have heightened in recent days , with Louisiana 's treasurer warning that BP could face bankruptcy .
The governors are also trying to stave off the collapse of their tourist industries .
" Most of the experience of coming to the Gulf coast is still as great as it's ever been , " Riley said .
" Rent a condo , play golf . "
Or take souvenirs of the spill .
At Orange Beach , a few people came with cameras to take snaps of the sludge .
Kevin Kaullen , an environmental engineer from near San Diego , California , arrived with battles to take samples of the water .
Otherwise the idea of helping Alabamans out by taking an eco - disaster holiday was not finding many takers , even among neighbouring Louisianans , who are going through their own economic pain owing to the spill .
On a local talk radio station , a host mused about how much of a discount on a condo it would take to make a beach holiday without an actual beach experience an attractive proposition .
" A 40 % discount ? " he said .
" I do n't think I would go for 40 % .
It would have to be at least 60 . "

Questions always arise during oil spills about the value of caring for affected wildlife .
The Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico is no exception .
Some argue that caring for individual oiled animals does very little for populations or ecosystems , and that few animals survive .
Others say we have a moral obligation to repair human - caused damage to the environment .
If approached pragmatically , rehabbing oiled animals can produce extremely positive results .
Even in the best of circumstances , many oil - affected animals will die in the rehabilitation center .
However , due to the evolution of professional oiled rehabilitation organizations over the past 30 years , survival is much higher than in the past .
For spills that my organization , the Oiled Wildlife Care Network , manages for California , we successfully release , on average , 50 to 75 percent of the live animals collected .
It is difficult to assess how long rehabilitated oiled animals survive once they are released into a clean environment .
Birds are banded to track them , but fewer than 1 percent of banded birds are found .
But by using radio tracking , we have found that birds survive much better after release than previously thought .
In certain species investigated , there are no discernible differences after release in survival and behavior between oiled and non-oiled birds .
Some argue that because many young animals do not normally survive to adulthood , only adult animals should be rehabilitated .
Others argue that rehab efforts should focus on endangered species , and individuals from more abundant species should not be collected during spills .
My organization collects all oiled wildlife that can be safely captured for these reasons :
-- Oiled wildlife are considered evidence during legal investigations ;
-- Animals can receive the best care possible instead of suffering untreated ;
-- Caring for the birds provides training and research opportunities and allows us to evolve care protocols .
-- Professional wildlife rehabilitators are best prepared to take on the societal responsibility of caring for the wildlife , otherwise it will certainly be done in the bathtubs of caring individuals .
This would not be the best practice for either the person or the animal .
Some say wildlife rehabilitation funds should be redirected to conservation efforts .
Oiled wildlife response is certainly costly at times , but oil spills , by their very nature , are expensive .
For example , wildlife recovery accounted for less than 5 percent of the response costs to the Exxon Valdez oil spill .
Yet spending less to clean and feed oiled wildlife will not necessarily free funds for other environmental restoration .
In the United States , the spiller is responsible for the costs of both spill response and environmental restoration costs .
Wildlife rehabilitation provides data to assign a monetary value to the damage to the environment .
In this way , wildlife rehabilitation enhances the collection of post - spill funds for environmental restoration .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Sea levels are rising unevenly in the Indian Ocean , placing millions at risk along low - lying coastlines in Bangladesh , Indonesia and Sri Lanka , scientists say in a study .

Researchers from the University of Colorado and the National Center for Atmospheric Research say the rising sea levels are caused in part by climate change and are triggered by warming seas and changes to atmospheric circulation patterns .
In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize last year , President Barack Obama warned that if the world does nothing to confront climate change , “ we will face more drought , famine and mass displacement that will fuel more conflict for decades ” .
The authors of the latest study say higher seas could exacerbate monsoon flooding , placing crops , homes and livelihoods at greater risk .
They argue a better understanding of the changes are needed to improve risk assessment planning for the future .
Sea levels in general are rising globally by about 3 mm ( 0.1181 inch ) a year .
Scientists blame rising temperatures caused by the growing amounts of greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels , that trap heat in the atmosphere .
Oceans are absorbing a large part of this extra heat , causing them to expand and sea levels to rise .
Warmer temperatures are also causing glaciers and parts of the ice blanketing Greenland and West Antarctica to melt .
The team of researchers in their study used long - term tide gauge data , satellite observations and computer climate models to build a picture of sea level rises in the Indian Ocean since the 1960s .
They found that sea - level rise is particularly high along the coastlines of the Bay of Bengal , the Arabian Sea , Sri Lanka , Sumatra and Java and that these areas could suffer rises greater than the global average .
But they also found that sea levels are falling in other areas .
The study indicated that the Seychelles Islands and Zanzibar off Tanzania ’s coast show the largest sea - level drop .
WARM POOL
“ Global sea level patterns are not geographically uniform , ” said co-author Gerald Meehl of NCAR in Boulder , Colorado .
The study is published in the latest issue of the journal Nature Geoscience .
A key player in the process is the Indo - Pacific warm pool , a large oval - shaped area spanning the tropical oceans from the east coast of Africa to the International Date Line in the Pacific .
The pool has warmed by about 0.5 degrees Celsius ( 1 degree Fahrenheit ) over the past 50 years , primarily because of mankind ’s greenhouse gas emissions .
The warmer water has strengthened two major atmospheric circulation patterns that have a major impact on sea levels .
“ Our new results show that human - caused atmosphericoceanic circulation changes over the Indian Ocean , which have not been studied previously , contribute to the regional variability of sea - level change , ” the researchers say in the study .
The two main wind patterns in the region are the Hadley and Walker circulations .
In the Hadley circulation , air currents rise above strongly heated tropical waters near the equator and flow poleward at upper levels , then sink to the ocean in the subtropics and cause surface air to flow back toward the equator .
The Walker circulation causes air to rise and flow westward at upper levels , sink to the surface and then flow eastward back toward the Indo - Pacific warm pool .
Strengthening of these two patterns could have far - reaching impacts on AsianAustralian monsoons , Indonesian floods and drought in Africa , the study says .

David Rosenberg , Chief Economist at Gluskin Scheff , has the following graph showing the dramatic drop in mortgage applications for home purchases in the most recent report from the Mortgage Bankers Association .
It is interesting to note that Rosenberg does not show an end date for the recession on his graphs .
Most optimists show an end date in the middle of 2009 .
Most realists show an end late third quarter or early fourth quarter .
Rosenberg is clearly a pessimist about the economy .
The official end date for the recession will be determined by the NBER ( National Bureau of Economic Research ) .
The determination often comes many months after the official date defined .
In other words , the end of the recession will be post - dated .
No date has been designated as yet .
ATHENS , Greece — Fotini was not surprised when a riot police unit stopped her and a friend for an ID check on Thursday .
She showed her national identification card and opened her bag for inspection .
But her indignation mounted as she was ordered into a patrol car before plainclothes policemen transferred her into an unmarked van and drove her to a detention facility .
“ The whole experience was surreal , ” said Fotini , a PhD student who declined to give her last name for fear of repercussions from the authorities .
“ It ’s against my constitutional rights to stop me from attending a demo . ”
Precautionary detentions are not a novel phenomenon in Greece , where the police often use heavy - handed techniques to quell violent demonstrations .
But there has been an edge to recent operations by a police force starting to wonder whether continued protests against economic austerity measures might prove a threat to the government of Prime Minister George Papandreou .
“ No Greek government has ever been stopped through demonstrating , ” said Ilias Kavourakis , an aging electrician who describes himself as a retired anarchist .
“ The only solution is for a popular protest movement divorced from political parties that will demand Greece ’s exit from the bloodsucking [ European Union ] , the return to the drachma and a fresh start . ”
Two weeks ago , massive protests against the strident austerity measures introduced by the Greek government to tackle its 250 billion euro debt resulted in anarchists burning down several buildings , including a bank .
Three employees suffocated to death in what was one of the largest protests since the collapse of the United States - backed Colonels ’ junta in 1973 and the restitution of democracy .
But Thursday ’s protests , which still drew large crowds , were a tamer affair and lacked stridency .
One reason for this is the marked absence of Greece ’s massive petit bourgeoisie .
The hard - working class known in Greek as noikokyrei occupy positions of influence in both the public and private sectors .
Although the austerity measures have hit their wallets hard , recent opinion polls reveal that they overwhelmingly support government plans to reduce Greek debt .
“ They ’re a silent majority who are absent from the streets , never protest , watch developments from a distance , are only active during election seasons and usually have political opinions but do n’t express them loudly , ” said Theodoris Georgakopoulos , the editor of the Greek edition of Esquire Magazine .
Thursday ’s nationwide strike was the first since Greece ’s parliament voted through a 40 billion euro austerity package that will see public sector salaries trimmed by up to 20 percent , value added tax raised to 21 percent and a crackdown on income tax dodgers .
The measures have angered Greeks who are demanding that corrupt politicians pay , instead of civil servants .
“ Even if this government falls , it ’s beside the point because others rule us , ” said Dimitris Makrozoidis , a protester , in a reference to the widespread belief that the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank are fronts for international capitalists determined to take advantage of Greece ’s crisis to privatize its industries .
" Prime Minister [ George Papandreou ] must understand that he can't go very far without the support of the society , ” said Alexis Tsipras , the leader of a coalition of left - wing parties called SIRIZA .
“ Either he 'll withdraw the austerity measures or he 'll have to leave by night . "
In Exarhia , a neighborhood of non-conformists that is the spiritual heartland of Greece ’s anarchist movement , all was quiet Thursday aside from a couple of trash bins simmering gently .
Inside the warren of grungy cafes and graffiti - daubed walls where police seldom venture , groups of long - haired young men and women in the anarchists ’ trademark black T - shirts dissected the day ’s events .
“ There ’s a majority who sit in front of the TV , do n’t think that the [ austerity ] measures are as necessary as the government presents them , but also believe that any resistance is futile , ” said Elli Syvilla Gregou , a lawyer and a leftist who has attended dozens of protests .
“ They ’ll cheer on the people who go to the streets and protest but also view their action as totally futile . ”
But the silence of the noikonyrei may not last much longer , warned Georgakopoulos , warning that the consequences will be social polarization and class tensions .
“ They ’ll have to find a voice at some point and I do n’t know against whom it ’ll be directed , ” said Georgakopoulos .
“ Deep inside them the noikokyrei know that they are to blame for what happened in Greece , part of a denial that is also expressed by the protesters . ”
Greeks are preparing for a long summer of strikes , tourist cancellations and an anticipated second explosion of violence in the fall , after the crisis has ground through the hot vacation months .
Back at the police detention center , Fotini and her friend were fuming alongside about 100 other people .
By the time they were released three hours later , the demonstration was over .
“ They want to terrorise people into not attending demonstrations , ” Fotini said .
“ They did n’t find any pretext to arrest us , not even an empty bottle .
There was no need to take us in .
It was a theater of the absurd . ”

DETROIT -- Todd Bertuzzi is not the physical presence he was during his prime , but the Detroit Red Wings still value his size , strength and net - front ability .
They believe it would have cost more to replace him in the free - agent market than to re-sign him .
So they ’re happy he agreed Wednesday to a two - year contract for $ 3.875 million .
“ He does a few things for us , ” general manager Ken Holland said .
“ He ’s a big body ( 6 - foot - 3 , 225 ) , he ’s hard to knock off the puck in the offensive zone .
“ He ’s worked on his physical conditioning .
He ’s made a conscious effort to become a net - front presence .
We got scoring chances because he ’s in front of the net drawing attention . ”
Bertuzzi had 18 goals and 26 assists in 82 games last season .
He picked up two goals and nine assists in 12 playoff games .
“ I think he ’s found a home here , ” Holland said .
“ He ’s adjusted to our system and fit into our locker room . ”
Bertuzzi will earn $ 2.25 million next season and $ 1.625 million in 2011 - 12 .
His salary - cap hit of $ 1.9375 million is higher than last season ’s $ 1.5 million .
“ There were some difficult times ( during negotiations ) , but we hashed it out over time , ” Bertuzzi ’s agent , Pat Morris , said .
“ He enjoyed his opportunity here , they ’ve enjoyed having him .
( The second year ) gives him continuity .
His kids and his wife enjoy Detroit . ”
The Red Wings have 18 players signed for $ 54.2 million ( those projected to make the team ) .
They still have their restricted free agents to sign : forwards Darren Helm , Justin Abdelkader , Patrick Eaves and Drew Miller and defenseman Derek Meech .
Holland also is contemplating re-signing veteran Kirk Maltby .
“ One guy we have to make a decision on is Kirk Maltby , ” Holland said .
“ I like Maltby .
He ’s been a warrior .
I think he ’s got some hockey left in him . ”
They have some decisions to make , noting , “ They all ca n’t be on the team . ”
Reports indicate the salary cap will rise from $ 56.8 million to somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 59 million .
“ We would n’t mind getting a veteran defenseman if the price is right , ” Holland said .
“ If not , we got ( Doug ) Janik and ( rookie Brendan ) Smith .
They ’ll have a chance to compete for a roster spot . ”
It does n’t appear as if defenseman Andreas Lilja will be re-signed .
Holland said he has n’t spoken to him since the end of the season .
Brett Lebda is not likely to be re-signed .
Holland said he might look to sign a gritty fourth - line forward or enforcer “ that fits in at our price . ”
They wo n’t have much to spend when free agency begins on July 1 .
“ We ’re not going to be players on July 1 , 2 or 3 , ” Holland said .
“ Later this summer we might explore some pieces . ”
It will be a quiet summer , as most of their pieces are in place .
“ I believe we ’re a better team heading into 2010 - 11 than we were heading into 2009 - 10 , with the addition of ( Jiri ) Hudler , and if we get better luck with injuries , ” Holland said .
“ We got potential for a lot of growth on our team . ”

Its name may be synonymous with European unity ‑ but increasingly its coffee shops are not .
Moves by the Dutch border town of Maastricht to ban foreigners from its marijuana cafes have been upheld by the European court , in a rare contravention of EU laws governing free markets and free movement of people .
In response to what it terms an influx of hordes of weed - seeking tourists , mainly from Belgium and France , Maastricht decided to limit admission to coffee shops to Dutch residents only .
Every day , some 4,000 tourists in search of the perfect smoke enter Maastricht , according to the major of the town .
Some 70 % of the town 's coffee - shop customers come from across the border .
Marc Josemans , owner and chairman of the Association of Official Maastricht Coffee Shops , brought a legal challenge before the Dutch council of state , arguing that a ban contravenes European legislation on free movement and free trade in goods and services within the EU .
The council asked the European court of justice for its interpretation of EU law , which it will then employ in its ruling expected at the end of this year .
In his finding , the EU court 's advocate general , Yve Bot , said that narcotics do not count as regular goods because they are against the law .
" Narcotics , including cannabis , are not goods like others and their sale does not benefit from the freedoms of movement guaranteed by European Union law , inasmuch as their sale is unlawful , " he said .
He did add however that in cases of their medical or scientific use , marijuana does " come under internal market rules " .
The court said that Maastricht was right to view drug tourism as " a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to public order " , and thus the restriction of foreigners from coffee shops " constitutes a measure necessary to protect the residents of the municipality from trouble " .

Big Homeopathy
" Homeopathy is safe and has no side effects , yet ' Big Pharama ' keeps pushing their poisons on us because they 're greedy . "
Have you heard this before ?
I have .
If modern medicines have side - effects or are n't effective in 100 % of cases , the reason doctors do n't stop using them is because so - called ' Big Pharma ' makes tons of money off of them .
Well , part of that is true .
Pharmaceutical companies do make money from the products they make .
Just like McDonalds or Home Depot or .... hey , what 's this ?
Companies that make homeopathic products make money too !
Let 's consider just one : Boiron .
Boiron makes homeopathic " remedies . "
They are a corporation , in fact they 're the second largest maker of over the counter preparations in France .
Here 's their page on their 2009 end - of - year market capitalization .
Looks like business to me , and yes , looks like a BIG business .
They make the common preparation Oscillococcinum , which is a homeopathic preparation of muscovy duck liver supposed to treat influenza .
In other words , they 're sugar pills that are sold for about $ 2.50 a pill .
During the recent H1N1 outbreak , I noticed that the large display of the product was almost empty in a local " health " food store .
$ 2.50 a pill is n't unheard of in prescpription medicine , but when you consider that homeopathic remedies require no FDA regulation , no testing , no trials , and apparently very little quality control , their profit margins must be considerable .
All arguments about the " greed of Big Pharma " can be thrown right back at the person making them .
There is greed in the pharmaceutical industry and no one is disputing that , but the industry is heavily regulated , and most important of all – they have proven results .
Homeopathy is amost pure greed .
Other than the occassional placebo effect , we know it does n't work , and so must the makers .

Some of us simply have trouble accepting things as they are .
Apparently I do .
There is hardly any sight in Northern California more beautiful than that of the Golden Gate Bridge .
With its distinctive orange - vermillion paint job , faithfully maintained year after year , it can be seen for miles .
I have no problem with the bridge as it is ; I love it .
But sometimes I get an urge to see what something might look like if it were different .
In late 2007 I began to redesign the Golden Gate Bridge .
I tried various schemes , and prepared enough drawings to satisfy my curiosity .
I had fun , but my designs were pretty ugly .
Whimsically - designed public works are relatively rare in cities around the world , but not entirely absent .
In Rome , tourists may occasionally encounter silly and amusing public sculptures and fountains .
Working on my designs for the Golden Gate Bridge , I tried shapes that might be amusing to a child .
But honestly , a design like the one depicted above might not seem so funny to commuters who had to drive between its legs twice a day .
For sure , I lack the engineering expertise that I would need if I were to actually redesign the Golden Gate Bridge .
My funky , wiggly and organic bridge support structure lacks gravitas and seriousness .
An international competition would be needed for such an important project .
The competition would offer an opportunity for talented bridge engineers to show off their unique plans for the bridge .
Allowing engineer - sculptors to submit designs would be an exciting event , though emotions would run high , given the public ’s sentimental attachment to the bridge ’s dramatic and straightforward design that has attracted admirers during its entire 77 - year history .
Judges would need to assess entries to make sure they met standards for public taste and morality , engineering integrity and ease of maintenance .
Even though it would be possible to match the existing strength of the Golden Gate Bridge ’s suspension system by using materials and structural members different from the original cable system , the public would likely rebel at a structure that is unpleasant to look at .
If my designs were built , the focus of the discussion would shift from the bridge ’s virtues to a public debate concerning the designer ’s sanity !
Bridge supports could become tourist attractions .
Here , a ship that is loaded with tourists docks alongside one of the Robot Man bridge supports and lets off passengers .
They ride the elevator up to Robot ’s Chest Restaurant , or all the way to the top to Robot ’s Head Bar .
Seriously , I am distressed by the dangerous condition of the aging bridges , highways , railroad tracks , and trestles that make up the nation ’s transportation system .
With declining or absent budgets , there is less room for public discussion about the need for high - level aesthetic input .
Perhaps a general appreciation for the work of star designers and big thinkers is waning right along with shrinking budgets .
And while humor is known to be an indispensable concomitant and byproduct of human intelligence , it is not listed as a design criteria in public works budgets .
For decades I have believed there is a need for whimsy in publicly - funded works such as street furniture and urban signage .
Here ’s my idea sketch for 1983 that included a note : “ What would happen if engineers in the Public Works Department had a bigger budget and an opportunity to express a sense of humor .
” No doubt , not all parts of the public infrastructure system are amenable to or improved by the application of whimsy .
My 1990 drawing of a future public transportation system , dubbed Municipal Light Entertainment Rail , showed a system that would likely be more disturbing than comforting !
For example , the experience of being mugged while riding inside a tunnel – one made to look like the rib cage and intestines of a monstrous fish – would be deeply unnerving !
An individual might need years of therapy to recover from the event .

Well , I finally posted the final draft of my reply to an article in Anarchist Studies on “ Syndicalism , Anarchism and Marxism . ”
I ’m planning to submit this to Anarchist Studies , mostly because I was somewhat shocked that an anarchist journal would publish such unsubstantiated claims on Marxism being a “ core ” ideological influence on syndicalism .
However , this seems to be a recurring theme and one I ’ve commented on before and will do so again , now .
My basic point , as expounded with appropriate sources in my new article , is simply that to suggest that syndicalism or “ the Chicago Idea ” was somehow a “ synthesis ” of anarchism and Marxism is simply false ( as covered in my post popular blog : “ Synthesised ” Marxism and Anarchism ?
My arse ! ” ) .
It fails to acknowledge the syndicalist ideas of Bakunin and others in the First International .
It fails to note that Kropotkin ( and others ) repeated this vision of anarchist activities , regardless of critiques of certain aspects of French .
syndicalist theory .
Ultimately , disagreements on aspects of syndicalism have been blown out of all proportion to paint a picture of a communist - anarchist and syndicalist divide ( true , some communist - anarchists rejected all suggestion of syndicalism and there were some Marxist - syndicalists but that cannot be taken as typical ) .
I discuss why many communist - anarchists did not call themselves syndicalists in AFAQ , so I wo n’t do so here .
Suffice to say , the discussion focused on the need for a specific anarchist organisation , whether unions by themselves were revolutionary and on the general strike as being sufficient in itself .
As I note in passing in a footnote , Darlington ( seriously ) misreads Malatesta ’s critique of syndicalism at the 1907 International Anarchist congress to falsely suggest a deeper divide between anarchists and syndicalists than actually existed .
Suffice to say , Malatesta did not disagree with the need for anarchists to work within unions or that class struggle would be the key means of achieving anarchism .
He simply , and rightly , questioned whether this was the be-all and end - all of anarchist activity , whether unions were sufficient in themselves and on whether the general strike , which he considered an excellent means of starting a revolution , was ( again ) sufficient .
Malatesta explicitly stated his critique focused on where he disagreed with the French syndicalists , leaving the large area of agreement unaddressed – for obvious reasons !
I doubt he expected future historians to ignore what he took for granted , but , well , historians can have their agendas .
It also does not help that the translation in “ The Anarchist Reader ” seems to leave syndicalisme as syndicalism rather than the more correct ( from the context ) “ trade unionism ” ( as when Malatesta proclaims “ syndicalism ” as “ reformist ” ) .
Of course the article does not cover many important issues .
For example , the influence of reformist anarchism ( Proudhon and mutualism ) on syndicalism ( leading French revolutionary syndicalists referenced Proudhon , for example ) .
After all , the evolution of libertarian ideas from Proudhon to Bakunin took place in the First International ( I discuss the mutualists in the IWMA and the relationships between mutualism revolutionary anarchism in the introduction to “ Property is Theft ! ” ) .
Then there is the issue , raised in Black Flame , of whether self - proclaimed Marxists who embraced syndicalism should be included in the anarchist tradition .
Some , yes .
My rule of thumb is on “ political action . ”
That is , if they consider syndicalism as a complement to electioneering then they are Marxist - syndicalists .
If they reject electioneering then they are de facto anarchists .
As Tom Mann came to reject electioneering I would class him an anarchist but not de Leon and Connelly .
Thus , council communism is closer to the revolutionary ideas of Bakunin than Marx and so is libertarian .
As I say , it ’s a rule of thumb and the key point to stress is that these Marxists were moving closer to Bakunin .
Talking of which , I should acknowledge Lucien van der Walt , whose comments on earlier versions of this essay were very useful and improved it considerably .
When I submit it to Anarchist Studies I ’ll include an acknowledgements footnote along with this abstract :
“ Ralph Darlington seeks to downplay anarchist influence on syndicalism while also suggesting that Marxism was one of its core ideological elements .
This means ignoring both the more obvious influence of Bakunin and that Marx and Engels explicitly rejected the syndicalist ideas expounded by libertarians in the First International .
The supposed conceptions syndicalism is claimed to have inherited from Marxism can all be found in the revolutionary anarchist tradition .
Rather than syndicalist ideas being inherited from Marxism , they arose from a large anarchist movement in the 1860s and subsequently influenced a wing of Marxism decades later . ”
This is not to suggest that , scattered here and there , are not comments by Marx and Engels which could come across as syndicalistic .
They both supported unions and strikes , for example .
However , their key position was the need for workers to organise political parties and exercise their “ political power ” by “ political action ” ( universal suffrage ) .
That was their legacy for the labour movement , not syndicalism .
Just compare the First and Second Internationals , with Kropotkin arguing that the socialism had “ moved away from a pure labour movement , in the sense of a direct struggle against capitalists by means of strikes , unions , and so forth ” in favour of standing in elections , political parties and so on .
( The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings , pp. 207-8 )
A key question is why do we even need to do this , I mean state the obvious about the links between anarchism and syndicalism ?
This seems to all flow from false assumptions .
Most Marxists , of course , follow Marx and dismiss anarchists as petit - bourgeois individualists who rejected class struggle and organization ( as per , for example , Pat Stack ’s abysmally bad article in Socialist Review ten years ago which I utilized so much in section H.2 of An Anarchist FAQ – or David McNally ’s ) .
The notion of the likes of Bakunin and Kropotkin rejecting class struggle simply cannot withstand even the slightest awareness of the facts , a fate which awaits anyone who suggests a clear difference between revolutionary anarchism and syndicalism .
Keynes , in a review of one of von Hayek ’s book , once stated that it “ is an extraordinary example of how , starting with a mistake , a remorseless logician can end up in Bedlam . ”
Much the same can be said of commentators on anarchism .
For example , in the anthology “ Patterns of Anarchy ” an economist called J. A. Estey argues that syndicalism is not a form of anarchism .
He admits the idea that syndicalism IS a form of anarchism was common and had “ countenanced to some extent by utterances of Syndicalists themselves ” ( p. 43 ) however this was not the case for there “ exists a veritable abyss between Syndicalists and philosophic Anarchists ” ( p. 45 ) Why ?
Well , because of “ the anti-social nature of Anarchism ” ! ( p. 45 )
Estey suggests that there are three types of anarchist : the Anarchist who throws bombs , the “ philosophic Anarchist of the type of Stirner ” and “ the Anarchist like Proudhon , an essentially social creature , who would abolish the State as we know it , only to set up in its place another . ” ( p. 44 ) He then states that syndicalists are neither type one or two .
Well , no surprise there .
However , type three is not really anarchist even though Proudhon “ was pleased to call himself an Anarchist ” but did so “ not in order that individuals should enjoy the pleasures of isolation ” !
In fact , “ no more ardent exponent of association ever lived ” and so “ [ t ] hroughout the entire body of Proudhon ’s writings runs this panegyric upon association , stamping him at once not an Anarchist , but as an ardent Socialist . ”
In short : “ The attitude of Proudhon is the attitude of the Syndicalist ” ( p. 46 )
So the founder of anarchism , the person who coined the term , is not an anarchist because he believed in association , not in “ isolation ” !
Never , then , was Bakunin , Kropotkin , Goldman and the rest of us .
Makes you wonder if Stirner was an anarchist in that case , as his “ union of egoists ” sounds remarkably like an association …
And , of course , Proudhon was a socialist !
Like all anarchists , but never mind we have our assumptions and by remorseless logic we end up in Bedlam …
This approach applies to more scholarly works as well .
A while ago ( well , 1994 ) Daniel Guérin ’s accounts of his 1930s trips to Germany were translated and published ( The Brown Plague : travels in late Weimar & early Nazi Germany , Duke University Press , Durham , 1994 ) .
In the introduction , Robert Schwartzwald ( p. 4 ) states the following :
“ Sympathetic to anarchist theory , Guerin was too sophisticated a student of state power and class forces to uncritically embrace anarchist practice ; yet , convinced of the revolutionary necessity of mass action , he instinctively distrusted all self - proclaimed leaderships ”
Now , I ’m not sure that anyone familiar with Guérin ’s life and ideas could actually write that .
I assume that the editor is a Marxist and so cannot bring himself to acknowledge that Guérin rejected Marxism for anarchism ( a bit like the “ anarcho ” - capitalist fans of Voltairine de Cleyre failing to note their “ genius ” became a communist - anarchist ) .
After all , Guérin had stated in 1973 the following :
“ I am a believer in militant revolutionary anarchism , though I prefer the term ‘ libertarian communism ’ to ‘ anarchism ’ – a libertarian communism combing the best elements of Marxist and anarchist ideas .
The outstanding anarchist thinkers were Proudhon and Bakunin .
I have little regard for Kropotkin , who was too utopian in his writings and did not understand the class struggle . ”
( Anarchist Voices , p. 468 )
Of course , what the “ best elements ” of Marxism are is a big question ( I guess , rightly , it ’s the critique of capitalism , but Marx was often developing and expanding upon the insights of Proudhon and others ) but he does proclaim his anarchism , even re-iterating that a “ practical brand of anarchism is the purpose of my own group ” ( p. 468 ) So Guérin was more than being “ sympathetic ” to anarchism – does that make him unsophisticated ?
As for “ uncritically embrace anarchist practice ” that is nice and vague .
I ’m not sure ANY anarchist does that , if by “ anarchist practice ” you mean everything anarchists have done !
Notice , though , the counterpoising of “ anarchist practice ” and “ mass action ” as if the two were somewhat at odds .
It would be better to say that Guérin embraced those forms of “ anarchist practice ” based on “ mass action ” , such as Bakunin ’s syndicalism I outlined in my article .
Suffice to say , we have a statement on Guérin which appears to mean something but when looked at closely becomes gibberish if you do n’t share the unstated ( Marxist ) assumptions of the person who wrote it .
( as an aside , I would question Guérin ’s dismissal of Kropotkin who was , myths not - with - standing , well aware of class struggle and its importance .
His theory of mutual aid is an important contribution to both biology and anarchist theories of social transformation .
I would , needless to say , I agree with the importance of Proudhon but have to note that while he did recognise the existence of classes and class struggle was always keen to stress reconciliation and peaceful reform ) .
Schwartzwald states that Guérin “ played an active role in a ‘ libertarian ’ Communist group in his later years ” .
Which raises the question of why libertarian in quote marks ?
Why the capital on Communist ?
What does he think “ libertarian communism ” is ?
Free - market Marxism ?
Self - managed gulags ?
Does he not know the history of libertarian and how it was first used by a communist ( an anarchist communist ) in 1858 ?
In a footnote , Schwartzwald states Guérin ’s was “ a small group on the French left that eschewed Leninist and vanguardist models of organisation and action ” – or , more correctly , a small group on the French left which embraced revolutionary anarchist models of organisation and action ?
So this self - proclaimed anarchist who aligned himself with libertarian communist organisations becomes “ one of the few French intellectual militants of this century to successfully negotiate the hazards of ‘ nonaligned ’ status ” !
After all , how could someone as “ sophisticated ” as Guérin be an anarchist ?
Just like how could syndicalist embrace of class struggle and organisation come from anarchism when , by definition , anarchism is petit - bourgeois individualism ?
A sadly all too familiar refrain of Marxists , particularly in the SWP .
As with the Chicago Anarchists , if Guérin embraced class struggle tactics and organisation the implication is that this somehow at odds with “ anarchist practice ” – which to make sense would mean also concluding that Bakunin , Kropotkin , Malatesta , Berkman , Goldman , etc. , were not anarchists !
Hence , I suppose , the need for the likes of the SWP to divide us into ( “ good ” , nearly Marxist ) syndicalists and ( “ bad ” , individualist ) anarchists .
If this means ignoring the well known pro-syndicalist positions of the likes of Bakunin and Kropotkin , so be it – when have mere facts bothered to ideologues ?
Thus we get articles on Emma Goldman and her ideas by members of the ISO which , as I showed , fail to mention her well know support for syndicalism and strike support activities .
That does not square with the assumptions and so are placed in the memory hole …
The whole notion that the Chicago Anarchists were “ really ” Marxists makes the almost complete silence by Engels about the Haymarket affair strange .
After all , surely if anyone would be able to recognise a Marxist it would have been Engels ?
Yet silence , at best mentioned in passing ( both publically and in his correspondence ) .
Then there is Marx ’s daughter and her husband , Eleanor Marx Aveling and Edward Aveling , who proclaimed :
“ The only necessity for stating , before we address ourselves to our task , that we are not Anarchists , but are opposed to Anarchism , lies in the fact that our position of antagonism to the teachings of Anarchism , strengthens our position in asking justice for the condemned men . ”
( The Chicago Anarchists )
No proclamations of comradely recognition there !
What about the Marxist organisations in America at the time .
T.V. Powderly , head of the Knights of Labour , during his quite disgusting diatribe against Anarchists ( From Thirty Years of Labor 1859 to 1889 : Anarchy and the Knights ) provides a useful quote , utilised to disabuse “ [ t ] hose who still believe that the anarchists of Chicago and the socialists of America were one ” , from “ a pamphlet issued by the Socialistic Labor Party on June 1 , 1886 , in refutation of the charge that socialism and anarchism were one ” :
“ In reading the newspapers we find the two names mentioned above frequently put side by side .
Nay , we And them also associated with the terms communism and nihilism , as though these four ‘ isms ’ had the closest relation to each other .
This is a mistake .
Socialism and anarchism are opposites which have nothing in common but their appurtenance to social science .
Socialists and anarchists as such are enemies .
They pursue contrary aims , and the success of the former will destroy forever the fanatical hopes of the latter . ”
Subsequently , the likes of Debs and De Leon made similar comments on the opposition of anarchism and socialism .
Of course , from this disavowal of anarchism as a form of socialism eventually comes the myth that anarchism is “ just ” against the state .
With Marxists asserting we were not socialists and anarchists taking our socialism for granted , the debate did become focused around the issue of the state .
For those not that aware of the history of anarchism ( your typical academic or “ anarcho ” - capitalist , for example ) , it becomes a simple case of defining anarchism as opposition to the state – particularly as we criticise “ socialism ” ( i.e. , Marxism and its off - shoots ) .
This is not the case , we are just as opposed to capitalism ( with Proudhon starting our position of opposition to both capitalism and the state back in 1840 ) .
However , back to Powderly whose words and logic ( if it can be called that ) are amazing .
Essentially , anarchists believe in “ anarchy ” ( as in chaos ) and all comments otherwise should be ignored ( sounds familiar ) .
After all , who can trust someone who seeks chaos ?
As Powderly puts it :
“ The average anarchist is cowardly and deceitful .
When he is asked to explain the principles of anarchy , he will give the definition which is advanced by the apostles of that school of thought .
This he will do if those who surround him are not anarchists , but free him from such surroundings and he at once begins to rave in an incoherent manner of what will be done if anarchy once prevails . ”
Assuming this was true ( which it is not ) , it makes you wonder how he knew this to be the case .
After all , he was not an anarchist and so presumably never got to see this raving in person … reminds me Tommy Sheridan who , in a book written after the anti-Poll - Tax riot , proclaimed that ALL English anarchists were not good anarchists like us in Glasgow ( who were , of course , syndicalists ) .
No English anarchist every , apparently , turned up to stop a warrant sale – unlike Sheridan who presumably attended every single one in England and quizzed those who were there on their political allegiance .
Of course , he was trying to deflect attention from his “ name names ” balls - up on the telly ( I still remember the subsequent Strathclyde anti-poll tax federation delegate meeting when the Class War Federation was proclaimed the “ name ” he was prepared to name – yes , really – and the demonisation of Class War was the order of the day ) .
Sheridan then went on to found the Scottish Socialist Party and this became the grand - hope for the British - left before imploding under the weight of Sheridan ’s ego and the usual sectarian in - fighting .
I reviewed his book Imagine for Black Flag ages ago , a mish - mash of reformist and Marxist ideas , with ( ironically ) a few dashes of Proudhon as well ( plus the amusing prediction the SSP would sweep to power in 2010 ) .
Anyway , to return to Powderly ( whom I know was not a Marxist ) :
“ The anarchist in America is no more to be considered a part of the labor movement than the man who sits up nights to work his way into a bank vault that he may enrich himself from the earnings of others . ”
That many of the Chicago Anarchists had been seasoned unionists , Knights of Labor members , clearly is irrelevant here .
He then quotes a paper called “ The Knights of Labor ” ( May 8 , 1886 , four days after the Haymarket police riot ) and its leading editorial :
“ Let it be understood by all the world that the Knights of Labor have no affiliation , association , sympathy or respect for the band of cowardly murderers , cutthroats and robbers known as anarchists , who sneak through the country like midnight assassins , stirring up the passions of ignorant foreigners , unfurling the red flag of anarchy , and causing riot and bloodshed .
Parsons , Spies , Fielding , Most , and all their followers , sympathizers , aiders and abetters should be summarily dealt with .
They are entitled to no more consideration than wild beasts . ”
Quite disgraceful .
Still , that is what we can expect and it continues to this day ( with a SWP member happy to suggest after Genoa that the Black Bloc was part of the police , for example ) .
Although I cannot help note the reference to the “ red flag of anarchy ” , something I ’ve mentioned on the AFAQ blog as a supplement to the appendix on Anarchist symbols in AFAQ .
There is one interesting comment in his rant :
“ [ The anarchists ] resorted to a most effectual means of doing injury .
Having secured control in certain Assemblies of the Knights of Labor , they would decide in the anarchist group what should be done , and then have a Local Assembly of the Order , of which I was the executive officer , pass resolutions against my administration . ”
Wow , these anarchists have no shame !
Taking part in a union assembly and getting their fellow workers to pass resolutions against Powderly … how anti-labour is that ?
I should mention that in this the Chicago anarchists echoed Bakunin ’s advice over a decade previously .
Taking the Geneva section of the IWMA , he notes that in the unions the membership " simply left all decision - making to their committees . . .
In this manner power gravitated to the committees , and by a species of fiction characteristic of all governments the committees substituted their own will and their own ideas for that of the membership . "
To combat this bureaucracy , the union " sections could only defend their rights and their autonomy in only one way : the workers called general membership meetings .
Nothing arouses the antipathy of the committees more than these popular assemblies . . .
In these great meetings of the sections , the items on the agenda was amply discussed and the most progressive opinion prevailed . "
( Bakunin on Anarchism , pp. 246-7 )
But , of course , apparently being pro-union makes you a Marxist ( at least according to historian James Green ) .
I get the impression that Stirner ( who never called himself an anarchist and whose influence on Marx seems greater than anyone else at the time ! ) is considered the ideal anarchist .
This can be seen from Marx and Engels repeatedly asserting a link between Stirner and Proudhon / Bakunin .
When I was doing research for the Proudhon Reader , I came across ( I think )
Marx proclaiming that Proudhon had got a certain point from Stirner .
Which raised some interesting questions .
From the first , far too long , introduction to “ Property is Theft ! ” :
“ Given that Proudhon did not read German and that the first French translation of Stirner ’s Ego and Its Own was made in 1899 , we can safely say Proudhon got nothing from the arch egoist ( assuming he was even aware he or his book existed ) .
For some reason , Marx and Engels were keen to link Bakunin with Stirner ’s ideas .
Engels talked about ‘ Stirner , the great prophet of contemporary anarchism - Bakunin has taken a great deal from him . . .
Bakunin blended [ Stirner ] with Proudhon and labelled the blend ‘ anarchism ’ ” For Marx , “ Bakunin has merely translated Proudhon ’s and Stirner ’s anarchy into the crude language of the Tartars . ’
( Marx , Engels and Lenin , Anarchism and Anarcho - Syndicalism , p. 175 and p. 153 ) .
While Bakunin ’s debt to Proudhon is well known and obvious , the link with Stirner seems to have existed only in the heads of Marx and Engels .
As Mark Leier notes , ‘ there is no evidence of this . . .
Bakunin mentions Stirner precisely once in his collected works , and then only in passing . . . as far as can be determined , Bakunin had no interest , even a negative one , in Stirner ’s ideas . ’
( Bakunin : The Creative Passion , p. 97 ) ”
Proudhon , as far as I am aware , never mentions Stirner and , on the face of it , it seems unlike that Proudhon even knew he existed .
Bakunin , as Leier notes in his excellent must - read new biography , was not influenced by Stirner .
I wonder how many Marxists take their comments at face value ?
On a personal note , I remember a Leninist coming up to me to inform me that he would be attending a meeting on Stirner ’s egoism by an old Syndicalist comrade at an Anarchist Summer School we held in Glasgow .
He proudly proclaimed that he was planning to read The German Ideology in preparation from the event .
He was genuinely shocked when I innocently asked whether this was before or after reading Stirner ’s The Ego and Its Own .
The thought had never crossed his mind !
One interesting point to note on this apparently random Stirner association by Marx and Engels , before the Paris Commune Marx complained about the French mutualists : “ Proudhonised Stirnerism .
Everything is to be dissolved into small ‘ groups ’ or ‘ communes ’ , which in turn are to form an ‘ association ’ , but no state . ” ( Anarchism and Anarcho - Syndicalism p. 43 ) Except Marx is implying that ANY social organisation is a state ( something Proudhon rightly questioned ) and so a federation of communes is a state .
After the Paris Commune , things became somewhat different : “ The whole talk about the state should be dropped , especially since the Commune , which was no longer a state in the proper sense of the word ” ( Engels , p. 154 )
So an association of communes is “ no longer a state ” , so implying that the mutualists had been right after all !
And here , of course , Marxists will invoke the magical word “ dialectical ” to absolve themselves of any possible contradiction …
So before March 1871 arguing for a federation of communes is “ Proudhonised Stirnerism ” ; afterward , the height of proletarian socialism …
Just as advocating syndicalism in the IWMA is to be mocked but Marxists embracing it and rejecting social democratic orthodoxy a few decades later shows an “ ideological ” influence …
I ’ve addressed this before ( for example , in the Proudhon and Marx appendix to “ Property is Theft ! ” and related blog posts ) .
But then , the Paris Commune did result in Marx and Engels embracing a lot of positions Proudhon had been publically arguing for since at least 1848 …
While , of course , attacking anarchists for holding the same opinions ( but first ! ) on , say , mandating delegates …
So , in short , we have a situation when the positions first held by anarchists are being passed - off as Marxist .
The attempts to portray Marxism as a “ core ” ideological influence on syndicalism is just the latest in a long line of such appropriations , just as the assertion that the Chicago anarchists “ synthesised ” Marxism and Anarchism by , well , applying Bakunin ’s ideas on revolutionary unions !
I have no problem with Marxists recognising the strength of these ideas , I just wish they would at least credit where they came from originally … but to do so would , I guess , undermine attempts to discredit anarchism …
Finally , a few words on our new CON - DEM- nation and the austerity the Tories are imposing .
Hats off to them , though .
They have managed to spin the narrative of this crisis from the factually correct ( we have a high deficit because we had to bail out the unregulated finance sector ) into the ideologically correct ( we have a high deficit because New Labour spent too much on the public sector ) .
The crisis caused by neo-liberalism is being used to further the neo-liberal agenda …
The Tories ( and if the Lib - Dems are having any impact , it is hard to tell – particularly as they have embraced with passion the Tory policies they denounced before the election ) have had their first budget .
And , unsurprisingly , once you remove the New Labour policies you discover that the Tory part of the budget is regressive :
“ As the IFS pointed out , the reason the measures looked so fair was because they took into account the announcements made by Labour in its last few budget statements – higher taxes on income , the clampdown on rich people 's pension relief and so on .
Strip those out to look at the measures brought in by the Cameron government – the rise in VAT next January , the uprating of benefits in line with inflation as measured by CPI rather than the higher RPI – and the burden falls heaviest on the poorest .
Indeed , by the end of the parliament , the IFS finds that the total cost of Mr Osborne 's budget was to make the poorest section of society 2.6 % worse off , while leaving the richest only 0.6 % down .
Not only does this show the new chancellor as having been unfair and unprogressive ; it also leaves an early impression that he is keen on spin , however misleading . ”
In graph form :
This is to be expected , it is the Tories !
Increasing VAT is their favourite , which is indirect and regressive , and guess what they did it again ( after Osborne stating on 6th April that “ [t ] he tax increases are already in place , the plans do not include an increase in VAT . ” ) .
The narrative of the budget was as to be expected , tax increases for all – although not corporation tax , which gets a cut , and an increase for Capital Gains Tax threshold for business .
In fact , the VAT rise was only necessary to pay for a series of tax cuts elsewhere , including > corporation tax ( so much for “ unavoidable ” tax rises ) .
Of course , there is the pathetically small and tokenistic bank levy ( £ 1.2 bn compared to the £ 850 bn to save the banks from collapse ) but rest - assured : “ Cut in corporation tax to 24 % from 28 % [ is ] expected to negate the impact of the levy on bank profitability . ”
Surprise !
Why ?
Because they are Tories and its what Tories do ...
As with the Republicans , the long term aim seems to be to eliminate taxation on property and shift it to working class ( by taxing labour income and buying ) .
Thus , as usual with capitalist ideology , the derived right ( property ) trumps the claimed fundamental right ( liberty or labour ) .
So the Tories are using the policies they inherited to portray themselves as being “ fair ” – but , of course , no matter who got in the cuts would have happened .
It is just that the Tories have no qualms about targeting the working class .
Ultimately , we have to resist these attacks – although , at present , we seem to be sleep - walking to austerity in the UK .
Which , I think , helps explain why the ruling class is pursuing such ideologically driven economic nonsense – they think they can get away with it .
Without resistance , without an alternative vision , they are making the most of their opportunity to get rid of what is left of the welfare state .
I say help , because we cannot underestimate the power of ideology and assumptions in decision making .
The Tories are usually true - believers in neo-classical economics and we cannot discount the power of faith in decision making .
We are just repeating the incompetence and dogma of the first few Thatcher years which deepened the recession but helped break the back of the labour movement .
Talking of which , I came across this letter in the Guardian :
“ At the conclusion of Adam Curtis 's 1992 documentary exposé of the destructive monetarist fantasies of Thatcherism , The League of Gentlemen , Alan Budd offers the following sombre observations on the 1980s policies for which he supplied the gloss of supposed economic objectivity :
‘ The nightmare I sometimes have about this whole experience runs as follows … there may have been people making the actual policy decisions … who never believed for a moment that this was the correct way to bring down inflation .
They did , however , see that it would be a very , very good way to raise unemployment .
And raising unemployment was an extremely desirable way of reducing the strength of the working classes … that what was engineered there , in Marxist terms , was a crisis of capitalism which recreated a reserve army of labour and has allowed the capitalists to make high profits ever since . ’ ”
As argued by the likes of Nicholas Kaldor and Thomas Balogh at the time ...
This interview is on YouTube :
Well , given that capitalism has been rooted in the “ Non- Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment ” ( NAIRU ) dogma since the late 1970s , Alan Budd ’s faith is truly touching .
Particularly since its main proponent got the so - called Nobel Prize for economics and the likes of the Economist stated that the role of unemployment was to cow workers …
As I wrote at the time , they should have given it to Marx .
Still , I ’m sure Budd will consider all that as just a co-incidence …
I would say that the Tories ( and Reagan ) utilised a crisis caused , in part , by working class strength in the late 1960s onwards and made it deeper , partly to break the unions , partly due to ideological blindness and partly just incompetence .
One thing is sure , inequality exploded under Thatcher ( an awkward fact ignored when Cameron hypocritically attacked inequality under Brown ) .
In the home of neo-liberalism , America , the top 1 % has more wealth than the bottom 90 % -- and nearly as much as the 90 - 99 percentiles :
( part of the essential 15 Mind - Blowing Facts About Wealth And Inequality In America )
Who said that capitalism is not working ?
Which brings me back to the issue of assumptions .
One of the key aspects of any resistance will be the need to counter the arguments for austerity .
We need to understand why cutting wages will make things worse and how the crisis developed as well as what reforms , strategies and organisations should we be raising , how the crisis brings forth the contradiction between profits and meeting human needs , etc .
We also need a vision , an alternative , to a system in crisis which flows from our resistance against capitalism .
While it is true that only social revolution will solve the crisis by removing capitalism , I do n’t think that most people will just jump to that conclusion .
We need to encourage people to make the choice between austerity and resistance and that involves showing how the latter will make our situation improve while the former will not only deepen the problem in the short term but also “ solve ” the crisis in the longer term ( until the next one ) by making those who did not cause it pay for it .
Anarchism offers this .
That Marxists keep appropriating our ideas and movements just reinforces that .
Until I blog again , be seeing you …
India unveils prototype for $ 35 touch - screen computer Published duration 23 July 2010
The Indian government has unveiled the prototype of an iPad - like touch - screen laptop , with a price tag of $ 35 ( £ 23 ) , which it hopes to roll out next year .
Aimed at students , the tablet supports web browsing , video conferencing and word processing , say developers .
Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal said a manufacturer was being sought for the gadget , which was developed by India 's top IT colleges .
An earlier cheap laptop plan by the same ministry came to nothing .
The device unveiled on Thursday has no hard disk , using a memory card instead , like a mobile phone , and can run on solar power , according to reports .
' Manufacturer interest '
It would cost a fraction of the price of California - based technology giant Apple 's hugely popular iPad , which retails from $ 499 .
Mr Sibal said the Indian tablet , said to run the Linux operating system , was expected to be introduced to higher education institutions next year .
The plan was to drop the price eventually to $ 20 and ultimately to $ 10 , he added .
Unveiling the gadget , the human resource development minister told the Economic Times newspaper it was India 's answer to the " $ 100 laptops " developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US .
" The solutions for tomorrow will emerge from India , " Mr Sibal said , reports news agency AFP .
Last year , one of the ministry 's officials announced it was about to unveil a $ 10 laptop , triggering worldwide media interest .
But there was disappointment after the " Sakshat " turned out to be a prototype of a handheld device , with an unspecified price tag , that never materialised .
To develop its latest gadget , the ministry said it had turned to the elite Indian Institute of Technology , and the Indian Institute of Science , after a lacklustre response from the private sector .
Mamta Varma , a ministry spokeswoman , said the device was feasible because of falling hardware costs .
Several global manufacturers , including at least one from Taiwan , had expressed interest in making the device , she said , although no deals had been agreed , and she declined to name any of the companies .
The project is part of a government initiative which also aims to extend broadband to all of India 's 25,000 colleges and 500 universities .
In 2005 , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) unveiled the prototype of a $ 100 laptop for children in the developing world , although it ended up costing about double that price .
In May , Nicholas Negroponte - of the MIT 's Media Lab - announced plans to develop a basic tablet computer for $ 99 through his non-profit association , One Laptop per Child .
I did not deliver my promised rainbow blog post .
While my brain spins out of control with article ideas and new plans , it can wait .
The real reason ?
I spent the last week in my hometown of St. Alban ’s getting stupid - drunk with dozens of old friends and long - lost relatives .
Hire me .
St. Alban ’s is a dying community .
Or at least it was , because now there are houses being built all over the place and a huge road is being created through the marsh right across from my house .
In an attempt to restore some life , every five years the community hosts a “ Come Home Year ” ( typical in small - town Newfoundland ) .
Basically it ’s a way to arrange a date ( 2 weeks ) so that everybody who grew up in the bay can come home at the same time and reconnect .
Reconnect .
Key word .
I was unprepared .
As soon as I arrived home on Thursday evening , my phone started ringing .
My friend ’s band was playing at The Warehouse Lounge .
I got a ride there in the box of a truck , beer still in hand .
There was traffic , more than two cars in a line !
Half of my father ’s family came to visit , as did my mother ’s .
This might not seem like a big deal , but consider the fact they each have 12 siblings .
Consider the fact they ’re all drinkers and know how to have a blast .
Good , honest , open people .
We had barbecue and shots of liqueur .
We roasted weenies and marshmallows on a firepit , then accidentally tipped over the picnic table .
All the booze gravitated towards my Aunt M , and we were hysterical with laughter for an hour .
There was a big beach party , with fireworks , live music , and cover charge .
I walked home with my Aunt M and her husband , who attempted to drag the cooler with a rope tied around his waist and then kicked it into a ditch instead .
I had to crawl over the side of the bank to fish out my mother ’s pot , and then wore it on my head for the remainder of the journey .
Repeat .
I discovered my cousin Jody was not a quiet , soft - mannered woman at all .
I partied with her and my cousin April until the wee hours of the morning .
The next evening , April and I drank beers outside on the grass with my other relatives , nothing but sweet - smelling lawn , warm air and family .
Everyone talked about how the vibe of the town had shifted with the Come Home Year celebrations , unlike any year prior .
For a second , I considered moving home .
Plus there was all the amazing stuff I ’ve missed .
I guess that ’s why Come Home Years are important in Newfoundland , we ’re imbued with that sense of community .
It ’s vital to our existence .
Now that we ’re all spread out across the country , the town is strung with provincial flags and signs of celebration .
Sunday night , the town hosted it ’s annual Cancer Benefit , which raises money for local cancer patients .
For a community of 1200 people , we ’ve been known to reach nearly $ 100,000 for the whole affair .
So with that reminder of what it ’s like to belong and be loved , I ’m back in the saddle .
( The saddle is my kitchen table and it makes my butt numb , but whatever .
More soon . )
But Hamas is not just a terrorist organization .
Hamas is an idea , a desperate and fanatical idea that grew out of the desolation and frustration of many Palestinians .
No idea has ever been defeated by force — not by siege , not by bombardment , not by being flattened with tank treads and not by marine commandos .
To defeat an idea , you have to offer a better idea , a more attractive and acceptable one .
Thus , the only way for Israel to edge out Hamas would be to quickly reach an agreement with the Palestinians on the establishment of an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as defined by the 1967 borders , with its capital in East Jerusalem .
Israel has to sign a peace agreement with President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah government in the West Bank — and by doing so , reduce the Israeli - Palestinian conflict to a conflict between Israel and the Gaza Strip .
That latter conflict , in turn , can be resolved only by negotiating with Hamas or , more reasonably , by the integration of Fatah with Hamas .
Even if Israel seizes 100 more ships on their way to Gaza , even if Israel sends in troops to occupy the Gaza Strip 100 more times , no matter how often Israel deploys its military , police and covert power , force cannot solve the problem that we are not alone in this land , and the Palestinians are not alone in this land .
We are not alone in Jerusalem and the Palestinians are not alone in Jerusalem .
Until Israelis and Palestinians recognize the logical consequences of this simple fact , we will all live in a permanent state of siege — Gaza under an Israeli siege , Israel under an international and Arab siege .
I do not discount the importance of force .
Woe to the country that discounts the efficacy of force .
Without it Israel would not be able to survive a single day .
But we cannot allow ourselves to forget for even a moment that force is effective only as a preventative — to prevent the destruction and conquest of Israel , to protect our lives and freedom .
Every attempt to use force not as a preventive measure , not in self - defense , but instead as a means of smashing problems and squashing ideas , will lead to more disasters , just like the one we brought on ourselves in international waters , opposite Gaza ’s shores .
BLOEMFONTEIN , South Africa — You really have to hand it to the French .
No team at the World Cup got the world 's attention like they did .
As we bid them bon voyage from South Africa , let 's count up all the lives they 've touched .
Ireland hates the French for cheating them out of a World Cup berth .
The French people hate the French team for disgracing them on the world stage .
The French team hates the French Football Federation for expelling one of its own .
And ...
They 've faced down humans time and time again , but Fred Phelps and his minions from the Westboro Baptist Church were not ready for the cosplay action that awaited them today at Comic - Con .
After all , who can win against a counter - protest that includes robots , magical anime girls , Trekkies , Jedi and ... kittens ?
Unbeknownst to the dastardly fanatics of the Westboro Baptist Church , the good folks of San Diego 's Comic - Con were prepared for their arrival with their own special brand of superhuman counter - protesting , chanting " WHAT DO WE WANT " " GAY SEX " " WHEN DO WE WANT IT " " NOW ! " while brandishing ironic ( and some sincere ) signs .
Simply stated :
The eclectic assembly of nerdom 's finest stood and delivered .

My first foray into Objective - C was , for lack of a better description , a sink - or - swim situation .
I was working for a previous employer and our lead iPhone developer had just been laid off ; my old boss was in my office the next day asking me how quickly I could “ get up to speed ” .
“ You know Ruby ” , he said , “ How difficult could it be ? ”
It was time to get some books .
The first point I would like to raise is that Objective - C , while itself quite elegant ( at least in comparison to its namesake ) , is fairly useless on the Mac platform without the Cocoa framework .
And it is this framework that I think a lot of Rubyists get hung up on .
The other big sticking point is manual memory management through the use of retain and release .
Cocoa ’s roots start all the way back in the 1980s with the NeXTSTEP operating system which tagged along with Steve Jobs when he was tapped to lead Apple again in 1996 .
This is why Cocoa ’s core classes , such as NSArray and NSString , all begin with ‘ NS ’ .
The naming scheme is a holdover from that earlier OS and while those two extra characters may not seem like much hassle , to a Rubyist they represent an unnecessary burden of verbosity .
In addition , Cocoa makes extensive use of the delegate pattern , something that is rarely seen or needed in Ruby and can make it difficult to trace an execution path for those unfamiliar with the concept .
One of the limitations of Objective - C , the inability to create difficulty in creating a function with a variable length argument list , is commonly resolved through the use of the poorly named hash userInfo , which frequently appears in method definitions without any connotation as to its purpose .
And lest we forget those wonderfully verbose method names , I think even the most die - hard and grizzled veteran of Objective - C would agree that NSString ’s stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString , could have been better - named .
Rubyists are proud of that fact that they do n’t have to worry about memory management .
The more knowledgeable Rubyists could tell you that the garbage collector , or GC , works by continually scanning objects in memory once a process has accumulated eight megabytes worth , checking to see if there are any pointers to those objects and then releasing them back to the OS if they do not .
But most Rubyists would refuse to venture any farther down that dark path of memory management out of a simple need to retain their sanity .
Indeed , for a good few weeks I struggled with this concept until my fellow iPhone student Paul Barry introduced me to a book that would change my outlook .
Titled “ Learn Objective - C on the Mac ” , it proved to be a treasure trove of information on object allocation .
Specifically , chapter nine , which dealt with memory management , made it crystal clear what was going on underneath the hood when an object was created , and thus retained , and when it was released .
The concept itself is simple : retaining an object increases its “ retain count ” by one ; releasing it reduces that count ; and when it reaches zero that space in memory is released back to the OS .
Immediately the seemingly - random crashes my applications faced were decipherable and easily fixed while my hostility to Objective - C and the Cocoa framework melted away .
As Rubyists , we tend to value the simple over the complex and prefer not to sweat the small stuff .
Yet on a whole we also desire learning new concepts and many of us can attest to that being the driving factor behind leaving a former language of choice behind .
On occasion , such as with Objective - C and Cocoa , our preference for simplicity and our desire to learn collide , head - on .
But rather than tweet about how ugly Cocoa looks or how memory management in Objective - C is beneath you , I challenge you to dive further .
After all , Ruby itself is built on Objective - C’s forebear , C , and no programmer has walked away worse for wear after peeking under the hood .
Learning Objective - C not only opens up the world of iOS application development but also makes us better Rubyists .
A day after BP closed off the flow of oil from its runaway well in the Gulf of Mexico , officials said the signs from a crucial test of the well ’s condition were encouraging .
Pressure readings in the well rose significantly in the 24 hours after the valves were closed on a cap at the top of the well , an indication that the well was in good shape .
But officials voiced caution , saying that they had expected that the pressure might rise even higher , and that the possibility of damage from the April 20 blowout could not yet be ruled out .
Another possibility , they said , is that the reservoir has been depleted by three months of gushing oil .
“ This is generally good news , ” Thad W. Allen , the retired Coast Guard admiral who is overseeing the spill response , said Friday afternoon , about 24 hours into what was expected to be at least a 48 - hour test .
“ But we want to be careful not to do any harm or create a situation that could not be reversed . ”
An anti-gay evangelical preacher in Uganda screened gay pornography in his church to try to build support for proposed anti-homosexuality laws , the BBC reports .
Pastor Martin Ssempa defends his screening of the porn to 300 church members Wednesday night by telling the BBC , " We have to educate ourselves about what homosexuals do . "
Ugandan law prohibits homosexuality and a proposed law would inflict the death penalty for some gay people .
IOL.com quotes Ssempa as saying he will try to screen the film for members of parliament .
Monica Mbaru from the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission condemned the pastor 's behavior , saying he can't screen pornographic material in the church " and then argue that you are upholding society 's morals . "
" I think we are dealing with someone who needs medical help , " Mbaru tells the BBC .

A 1969 photo showing Armstrong , or anyone , really , standing on the surface of the " moon . "
LEBANON , OHIO — Apollo 11 mission commander and famed astronaut Neil Armstrong shocked reporters at a press conference Monday , announcing he had been convinced that his historic first step on the moon was part of an elaborate hoax orchestrated by the United States government .
Advertisement
According to Armstrong , he was forced to reconsider every single detail of the monumental journey after watching a few persuasive YouTube videos , and reading several blog posts on conspiracy theorist Ralph Coleman 's website , OmissionControl.org .
" It only took a few hastily written paragraphs published by this passionate denier of mankind 's so - called ' greatest technological achievement ' for me to realize I had been living a lie , " said a visibly emotional Armstrong , addressing reporters at his home .
" It has become painfully clear to me that on July 20 , 1969 , the Lunar Module under the control of my crew did not in fact travel 250,000 miles over eight days , touch down on the moon , and perform various experiments , ushering in a new era for humanity .
Instead , the entire thing was filmed on a soundstage , most likely in New Mexico . "
Advertisement
" This is the only logical interpretation of the numerous inconsistencies in the grainy , 40 - year - old footage , " Armstrong added .
Amstrong was swayed by OmissionControl 's use of bolding and capital letters to highlight NASA 's many blatant fallacies .
Advertisement
Although Armstrong said he " could have sworn " he felt the effects of zero gravity while soaring out of the Earth 's atmosphere and through space , he now believed his memory must be flawed .
He also admitted feeling " ashamed " that he had failed to notice the rippling of the American flag he and Buzz Aldrin planted on the surface , blaming his lack of awareness on the bulkiness of the spacesuit and his excitement about traveling to the " moon . "
" That rippling is not possible in the vacuum of space , " Armstrong said .
" It must have been the wind from an air - conditioning duct that I did n't recognize because you can't hear a damn thing inside those helmets . "
Advertisement
" This is all just common sense , people , " he added .
" It 's the moon .
You ca n't land on the moon . "
In a symbolic display of his newfound skepticism , Armstrong then grabbed a collection of moon rocks he had kept as souvenirs and dramatically dumped them into a trash can .

One of the main arguments posited on Coleman 's website — that America could not , in 1969 , have realistically possessed the technological capabilities needed to put a man on the moon — was reportedly one of the first things to cause the legendary astronaut a pang of doubt .
Despite having spent thousands of hours training for the historic mission under the guidance of the world 's top scientists , technicians , and pilots , Armstrong said he knew the conspiracy theories were true after learning that website author Coleman was " quite the engineering buff . "
" Yes , at the time I thought those thousands of NASA employees were working round the clock for the same incredible goal , but if anyone would know what was really going on , it would be Ralph Coleman , " Armstrong said of the 31 - year - old part - time librarian 's assistant .
" He knows a lot more about faked moon landings than I ever could .
He 's been researching the subject on the Internet for years . "
Advertisement
" Literally years , " he added .
Addressing another inconsistency brought to light by OmissionControl , Armstrong explained he was probably so focused on piloting the lunar module that he failed to notice that one of the moon rocks visible in footage of the landing appears to have the letter ' C ' stamped on it .
An emotional Armstrong said that the only possible explanation for this detail was that the rock actually came from NASA 's prop department .
Advertisement
" They forgot to turn it over , " Armstrong said , removing his eyeglasses to wipe away tears .
" Those lying bastards at NASA went through all the trouble to fake the moon landing , but they forgot to turn over one little prop rock .
And now the whole damn thing 's blowing up in their faces . "
Although Armstrong initially questioned why the U.S. would attempt such an elaborate cover - up , he cited one overarching explanation provided by Coleman : that it was a ploy to defeat the Soviet Union and fulfill the Illuminati's plan to unify the world 's banks and control the dissemination of information .
Advertisement
" Just ask Ralph Coleman , " Armstrong said .
" He 'll answer any questions you have . "
To conclude the press conference , Armstrong showed reporters footage of his first steps on the moon to demonstrate that the most daming evidence was " right under our noses . "
Speeding up the tape and replaying the graceful moonwalk several times in a row , Armstrong explained that the iconic images of humanity 's triumphant dance with the cosmos was actually just a film of him walking backwards , slowed down , and played in reverse .

" What other explanation could there be ? " Armstrong asked .
" It 's all right here .
Everything is all right here if you 'd just open your damn eyes and see ! "
Added Armstrong , " I suppose it really was one small step for man , one giant lie for mankind . "

The director of Canada 's security services said that at least two high - ranking provincial politicians were believed to be under the control of foreign governments .
Richard Fadden said two provincial cabinet ministers " have developed quite an attachment to foreign countries " .
He said several members of municipal governments in British Columbia were also under suspicion .
He did not name the politicians or countries suspected of being involved .
Mr Fadden , who heads of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , was speaking to the CBC's The National programme .
He said the politicians involved had no idea they were being used , and that his agency was in discussions on how best to notify the provinces concerned .
" We 're in fact a bit worried in a couple of provinces that we have an indication that there 's some political figures who have developed quite an attachment to foreign countries , " he told the CBC .
He said the individuals were being targeted early on in their careers , with a view to developing a relationship that could be exploited at a later date .
" The individual becomes in a position to make decisions that affect the country or the province or a municipality .
All of a sudden , decisions are n't taken on the basis of the public good but on the basis of another country 's preoccupations , " he said .

If you grew up in the 80’s and played video games , at one point in your childhood you had to blow on an NES cart , or inside the console itself , to get it to recognize a game .
In fact I never even had an NES , but I can still remember having to do it on a friend ’s system .
At this point it ’s almost become cliche to bring it up whenever the conversation turns to classic video games , but that did n’t stop one clever modder from attempting to turn a profit on Nintendo ’s folly .
Seller nes_harmonica has turned a handful of old NES carts into working harmonicas , and has put their creations on eBay for the world to ignore it seems .
At the moment there are Dick Tracy , Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 3 versions available with starting bids of just $ 7 , and since they were created using Hohner Pocket Pal harmonicas , they ’re most definitely playable .
It ’s a clever idea that might make you chuckle , but it ’s not clever enough for 7 of my hard earned dollars .

Glenn Beck Uses History to Attack Women ’s Reproductive Rights
Glenn Beck celebrated “ Founders ’ Friday Women ’s Day ” today .
Yes , you know this is n’t going to a good place .
Beck , apparently having ran through all of the modern era villains , reached back to the the last century to find his latest victim , “ one of the most horrible women in American history ” , named Margaret Sanger who was a … … NURSE !
Shudder .
A nurse who cared about unplanned and unwelcome pregnancies , a “ champion of women ’s rights ” — clearly a threat to the modern conservative .
Today on the July 2 edition of Fox News ’ Glenn Beck , Beck took to the airwaves to condemn “ one of the most horrible women in American history ” , Margaret Sanger .
Yes , apparently Margaret has caused Glenn many a tear on the late nights when he sits up contemplating how the progressives have ruined the world .
No matter that she is long gone , having died in 1966 .
Beck is still afeared .

Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
When audience member Raven asked about that “ terrible person ” Margaret Sanger , Beck said , “ She is really .
She is one of , if nobody has really done it , you go home and you Google Margaret Sanger , and really get down to her real words on progressivism .
She is one of the most horrible women in American history , horrible . ”
Beck then blamed , drum roll , please , Woodrow Wilson , “ Woodrow Wilson was really one of the main guys who did it . ”
He then went on to blame Edward Bernays , who helped work on influencing public opinion towards supporting US participation in World War I , and he blamed Wilson for changing the history books and the Constitution . ”
This is not the first time that Beck has attacked Sanger .
Here is video from April 2009 :
This danger to American society , Margaret Sanger , worked as a nurse .
She worked with the poor .
She eventually wrote for the Socialist Party paper .
She is also credited with inventing the term birth control and being a founder of what became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , an evil which leads some less than nuanced thinkers ( also known as people who oppose birth control and abortion ) to charge her with eugenicism and racism in an attempt to discredit her as a hero for women ’s rights .
Anti-contraception activists have long cherry picked through Sanger ’s writings with the agenda of declaring her a horrid person , unworthy of being taught about in school as a hero for women ’s rights .
And in truth , her history appears radical and some of her words and ideas offensive in modern day context , but then , when Sanger was alive , she was considered a militant feminist for advocating the right to practice birth control .
In August of 1914 , Sanger was eventually indicted for violating postal obscenity laws for advocating the use of contraception .
Sanger ’s many arrests and prosecutions , and the resulting outcries , helped lead to changes in laws giving doctors the right to give birth control advice ( and later , birth control devices ) to patients . ”
In an interview with Mike Wallace in 1957 , she explained , “ I was what I would call a born humanitarian .
I do n’t like to see people suffer , I do n’t like to see cruelty even to this day , and in nursing you see a great deal of cruelty and unnecessary suffering ….
I naturally did n’t want to see women take all the suffering of child - bearing and of pregnancies .
So it was a pleasure in a sense to think that you were striking at an archaic law , which it was .. it was put on the statute books by Anthony Comstock some years ago , and a no one had stood up against it and no one had –had tried to change the laws , and at that time not even a doctor had a right to use the United States Mail in common carriers for books , for learning , for anything that he had to do with this question .
It was considered obscene .
The whole question was considered obscene . ”
When asked about the church ’s stance on women ’s reproductive rights , Sandler replied , “ It ’s an unnatural attitude to take –how do they know ?
I mean , after all , they ’re celibates .
They do n’t know love , they do n’t know marriage , they know nothing about bringing up children nor any of the marriage problems of life , and yet they speak to people as if they were God . ”
Yikes , Margaret !
Taking on the church and the law to fight for women ’s rights and never bowing to the pressure of the patriarchy is n’t going to win Margaret any friends from Beck ’s world .
If you want to hear Margaret Sanger ’s interview ( in her own words ) , listen here .
Margaret Sanger did n’t hold back ; she was clearly very opinionated and rubbed a lot of people the wrong way .
But then , the status quo is rarely changed by people who are liked by everyone .
Even so , some contextual awareness is necessary if one is going to weed back through history to find “ progressives ” to demonize .
But we all know that nuanced thinking is not a Beckian trait .
When we look back in history , we are going BACK to a different time .
A time , I might remind you , that Beck and the conservatives want to return to .
During this “ great ” time , women had no rights over their own bodies .
African Americans were hardly equals .
The disabled were treated with even more disregard than they are now .
Taking all of that into context , it ’s easy to see that Sanger ’s views were not perfect .
But Beck is engaging in the disingenuous practice of denouncing revisionist history , while in fact revising history to fit a far right wing ideology which will stop at nothing less than a complete reversal of the rights of woman and a return of our gender back to our subservient 19th Century roles .
Sanger was a champion of women ’s reproductive rights and deserves to be remembered as such instead of having agenda - laden Glenn Beck use and distort her views to enrage his viewers ( i.e. , fill his own coffers ) .
Justin Bieber 's " My World Tour " Twitter voting contest asked fans to vote on which country he should tour next , without restriction on which countries could be included in the vote .
4 chan smelled opportunity : Anonymous nominated North Korea , then the boards clickswarmed .
At the time of this blog post , more than half a million votes now demand the Canadian singer go do his thing on Kim Jong Il 's party train .
I can't tell what 's funnier , the Bieb stunt or the Beeb 's coverage :
The contest , which ends at 1800 on 7 July , saw North Korea move from 24th to 1st place in less than two days , several thousand votes ahead of Israel .
Given the fact that almost all citizens of North Korea are denied internet access and there are restrictive controls over all media , it is unlikely that any of the votes have actually come from within the country .
A spokesman for the North Korean Embassy in London told BBC News that any application for 16 - year - old Bieber to tour would be dealt with by its mission to the United Nations , although the matter would be referred to Pyongyang .
Thank you for reminding us this is serious bizness , BBC News .
Anyway , if the prank 's outcome really does obligate Bieber to go to North Korea — hey , fair 's fair — let 's just hope he stays there .
Just one day left for votes , as I publish this blog post !
Also : 4 chan 's been busy with this guy .

40 - year - old sails from Cape Horn under jury rig
Italian Alessandro Di Benedetto has completed a 268 - day circumnavigation in a 21 - foot mini-Transat , becoming the smallest boat to sail around the world solo and nonstop in such a time .
Di Benedetto ’s feat is more impressive as he dismasted just before rounding Cape Horn , forcing him to sail the entire length of the Atlantic under jury rig .
After the dismasting he set up the jury rig and headed for Chile , but the new configuration worked so well that he rounded the Horn with it and continued his non -stop voyage .
Yesterday Di Benedetto , 40 , arrived in Les Sables d’Olonne , France where he started nearly nine months ago .
He said : ‘ It was really fantastic for me .
It was a dream I ’ve always thought was feasible .
However , there are plenty of people told me I was crazy and that I would die . ’
Although his boat was slightly modified , it was designed for fast , leeward sailing in the Atlantic , not for the high Southern Ocean waves .
The World Speed Sailing Record Council ( WSSRC ) has approved his official time is 268 days , 19 hours , 36 minutes and 12 seconds and it is thought he also broke the record for the longest distance sailed under jury rig , although this is not officially recorded .

The Reformed Broker thinks China is a huge secret buyer of gold , highlighting a very interesting anecdote from CNN Money .
Reformed Broker :
' China is considered a stealth buyer of gold , said Boris Schlossberg , director of currency research at Global Forex Trading .
As the world 's largest producer of the metal , China often buys gold from its own mines and does n't report those sales publicly .
But in April 2009 , China did admit to having added 454 tonnes , or a 76 % increase , to its reserves since 2003 .
Analysts suspect the country is continuing to buy gold and could in fact , be the world 's largest buyer consistently .
It simply does n't reveal it 's pro-gold stance proudly , however , because China is also the world 's largest holder of U.S. Treasurys .
Announcing an aggressive gold buying spree is not in China 's best interest because , for one , it might push gold prices higher .
Secondly , it could devalue the U.S. dollar , which would subsequently lessen the worth of the country 's portfolio of U.S. government bonds , Schlossberg said . '
Here 's our question though ... does the Chinese government pay a market rate ?
Or do they just appropriate the gold from domestic miners at a below - market price ?
We 'd bet on the latter , which would make secrecy around purchases make even more sense .
WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told President Barack Obama his government was prepared to take " concrete steps " to bring about direct Middle East peace talks , as the two leaders sought to heal ties that have frayed during the past year over the issue of Palestinian statehood and Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
Mr. Netanyahu , during a highly anticipated public appearance with Mr. Obama at the White House Tuesday , did n't specify what Israel was willing to do to kick - start negotiations with the Palestinians .

NO sooner had Alex Rospos arrived from Los Angeles for a Memorial Day weekend on the Jersey Shore than he witnessed , and fell victim to , his first prolonged session playing what has become the nation ’s biggest viral drinking game , otherwise known as “ icing . ”
It began six hours after he arrived — “ I iced a friend at lunch , ” he said — but really took off at a barbecue around the family pool in Belmar the next day .
“ There have been over 20 icings so far , ” Mr. Rospos , a 25 - year - old aerospace engineer said , a beer cozy carrying a warm bottle of Smirnoff Ice clipped to the back of his belt with a carabiner .
“ You have to watch yourself . ”
The premise of the game is simple : hand a friend a sugary Smirnoff Ice malt beverage and he ( most participants have been men ) has to drink it on one knee , all at once — unless he is carrying a bottle himself , in which case the attacker must drink both bottles of what Mr. Rospos described as a “ pretty terrible ” drink .
Amid suspicion that the trend is an elaborate viral marketing campaign by Smirnoff , which the company has denied , new icing photos are posted daily on various blogs , Twitter and Facebook — including scenes from graduations and weddings — and sent directly to a Web site , BrosIcingBros.com .
The speed with which Mr. Rospos and a group of his friends from high school adopted the game mirrors the rapid spread of Bros Icing Bros from the Web to backyards , living rooms and cubicles around the country , exploding from obscurity in May into a bizarre pastime of college students , young professionals and minor celebrities that counts among its targets the rapper Coolio , the actor Dustin Diamond and members of the rock band The National .
A campaign online aims to ice Ashton Kutcher , who often serves as a kind of Kevin Bacon of Web memes , linking disparate areas of the Internet in fewer than six degrees .

BERLIN ( AP )  Germany 's domestic intelligence service has started a program for Islamic radicals who want help to quit extremism .
The program started Monday and addresses people who believe in a " fanatic , violent ideology ... based on Islam . "
The program called HATIF — meaning phone in Arabic — aims to help extremists to leave behind their fanatical environment .
They can contact members of the intelligence service online or call a specific number .
The agency — which says it is guaranteeing confidentiality — says it wants to help people get out by supporting them with finding jobs or moving to a different place .
The intelligence service estimates there are more than 36,000 Islamic extremists in Germany but only a fraction are considered potentially violent .

Potty peer Christopher Monckton has stepped up his campaign to shut down John Abraham ’s debunking of one of his talks last year , by asking supporters to flood Abraham ’s university with emails demanding it start a disciplinary inquiry .
George Monbiot points out the obvious irony in the Guardian today :
Reading these ravings , I ’m struck by two thoughts .
The first is how frequently climate change deniers resort to demands for censorship or threats of litigation to try to shut down criticism of their views .
Martin Durkin has done it , Richard North has done it , Monckton has done it many times before .
They claim to want a debate , but as soon as it turns against them they try to stifle it by intimidating their opponents .
To me it suggests that these people can give it out , but they ca n’t take it .
Monckton has since posted at Watts Up WIth That , including this appeal for support :
May I ask your kind readers once more for their help ?
Would as many of you as possible do what some of you have already been good enough to do ?
Please contact Father Dennis J. Dease , President of St. Thomas University , and invite him “ even at this eleventh hour ” to take down Abraham ’s talk altogether from the University ’s servers , and to instigate a disciplinary inquiry into the Professor ’s unprofessional conduct , particularly in the matter of his lies to third parties about what I had said in my talk at Bethel University eight months ago ?
That would be a real help .
[ My emphasis , Dease email removed ]
In other words , please help me to bully Abraham and the University into caving in to my absurd demands , and take Abraham ’s presentation off the web .
In my view , it ’s time to stand up to the potty peer ’s attempts at intimidation of Abraham and his University .
Rather than flood them with email , I propose that anyone who supports the statement below leave a comment with their name , location and academic affiliation ( if any ) .
You will need to leave an email , but that will not be published .
I will enforce strict moderation .
If you want to support Monckton , go elsewhere .
I will ensure that Abraham and the university are aware of the thread .
Please leave a comment and encourage as many people as possible to join in .
We the undersigned offer unreserved support for John Abraham and St. Thomas University in the matter of complaints made to them by Christopher Monckton .
Professor Abraham provided an important public service by showing in detail Monckton ’s misrepresentation of the science of climate , and we applaud him for that effort , and St. Thomas University for making his presentation available to the world .

The tactical craze of the 2009 / 10 season has been deploying inverted wingers ( that is , the opposite side to which their strongest foot would generally dictate ) , so it ’s fitting that we have a European final that showcases two sides who take this approach to wing play .
Atletico , remarkably , have reached this final despite an abysmal European record this season , that stands at 2 wins from 14 matches .
DLLDDL in the Champions League , DWDDDDWL in the Europa League .
Moreover , this record is not even a surprising , harsh verdict upon their season – throughout much of the season , they have been awful .
They sit in 9th place in La Liga – disappointing enough as it is , but this is actually the first time in the entire season that they have found themselves in the top half of the table ; for a month they found themselves stranded in 17th place in a genuine relegation fight .
Replacing Abel Resino with Qique Sanchez Flores has seen them rise up the table and reach this final , but they are still far from a cohesive side .
The opposite could be said of Fulham .
Frankly unable to match the raw talent Atletico boast , Fulham ’s progress to Hamburg tonight has been based around a well - organised , disciplined defensive base , combined with intelligent , creative play in the final third .
Roy Hodgson ’s achievement has been to cram three clever , thoughtful attacking players into the same team .
Many managers would find room for only two or three of Danny Murphy , Damien Duff , Zoltan Gera and Simon Davies , but Hodgson has found a system where he can utilize all four at once , with the focal point of Bobby Zamora playing as a fairly traditional targetman as a more direct threat .
As the underdog , one would expect that the onus is on Hodgson to adapt his side to Atletico ’s , rather than vice - versa , but then Fulham have started each of their knockout ties as the underdog – and in each tie they have played the same formation , which has the ability to play primarily on the counter - attack , or to play a more outright offensive game and dominate the game in the opposition ’s half .
Tonight , you would expect them to start with a counter - attacking style .
Atletico ’s system has pace on the wings and upfront , and leaving gaps at the back for them to exploit could see Atletico take a commanding advantage early on .
Fulham ’s start to the game will probably be similar to the gameplan away in Hamburg – which produced what was frankly a very dull game , but a good ‘ half - time ’ scoreline of 0 - 0 .
That game was good preparation for tonight , not merely because the game is being played in the same stadium , but because Hamburg , too , play a system of inverted wingers , meaning John Pantsil and Paul Knochesky are at least used to the threat they will face tonight , and Fulham ’s defence in Hamburg was notable for how narrow it played .
Expect the same thing tonight , to force Simao Sabrosa and Jose Antonio Reyes down the line , rather than in onto their stronger foot .
In basic terms , Atletico ’s system is very similar to Fulham’s .
The main difference is arguably in the roles of the two central midfield players – whereas Dickson Etuhu is clearly the ‘ tackler ’ and Danny Murphy the ‘ passer ’ , Paulo Assuncao and Raul Garcia are more well - rounded midfielders , although Garcia ( whose position has come under threat from the cup - tied Tiago in the league ) has more license to go forward .
Their wingers are slightly more direct but certainly less disciplined , Forlan is less of a targetman and more of a poacher who likes through balls , and Aguero has more of a free role than Gera .
That said , this is basically the same formation playing each other .
The problem was this match - up in the Hamburg v Fulham tie was that the pitch became incredibly narrow – with four wingers looking to cut inside and none of the full - backs providing a sufficient attacking threat .
That could be the key tonight – which side manages to get its full - backs forward to better effect , or , to take it further , which set of wide players do a better defensive job against the opposition full - backs .
A tight , tense game will favour Fulham , with Atletico preferring a more open contest where their flair players have room to work in .
Atletico will need one of them to have a star performance to win the game , otherwise Fulham ’s resilience and cohesion could come out on top .

A police officer stands guard by bags of cocaine -- more than four tons were seized around Peru -- in Lima , May 7 .
Almost 80 % of cocaine coming into the USA includes levamisole , an anti-worming agent used in barnyard animals , says epidemiologist Ghinwa Dumyati .
FOLLOW @USATODAYHEALTH
FOLLOW @USATODAYHEALTH
Cocaine abusers — already at risk for an abnormal heartbeat , blood pressure problems , hallucinations , convulsions and stroke — can add another potential health complication to the list : rotting flesh .
" If you are a user of cocaine , you should be aware that some of the cocaine is not clean and can have other agents that can cause you to have a low white - cell count or skin tissue death , " said Dr. Ghinwa Dumyati , an associate professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and an epidemiologist for the Monroe County Health Department in New York .
In a report in the June 1 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine , Dumyati and doctors from the University of Rochester Medical Center discuss two cases involving women with a history of cocaine use who came to the hospital for help when they noticed purplish plaques on their cheeks , earlobes , legs , thighs and buttocks .
Their profiles were typical of toxicity with levamisole , the doctors reported .
The medication is a veterinary anti-worming agent , approved for use in cattle , sheep and pigs .
It was once used to treat cancer , autoimmune diseases and kidney problems in humans , Dumyati said .
It 's no longer approved for use in people in the United States , she said , because of adverse side effects .
But it 's often used to cut cocaine , before distribution to the user , she said .
" Almost 80 % of the cocaine coming into this country has levamisole mixed in , " Dumyati said .
Exactly why is not known , she said .
Some say it might enhance the effects of the drug , which include a euphoric mood or " high " and a boost in energy .
It also might be used to stretch the drug and increase profits .
" The person using cocaine would not know this ( levamisole ) is in it , " Dumyati said .
In the new report , the doctors concluded , based on the women 's symptoms , that cocaine laced with levamisole cannot only cause problems with white blood cells — a problem previously reported — but also death of the skin 's outer layer .
They said that physicians should suspect cocaine abuse when they see patients with skin lesions caused by tissue death .
" The drug may induce an immunological reaction producing inflammation or vasculitis , an inflammation inside the small blood vessels , " Dumyati said in explaining the link to tissue death .
" The result can be the death of the epidermis or outer layer of skin . "
But that 's not all that 's bad about levamisole .
" It has other side effects , " she said .
" It has effects on bone marrow function .
There can be a drop in the white blood cell count . "
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in late 2009 on a cluster of cases of problems with white blood cell counts linked to cocaine use .
Called agranulocytosis , the condition occurs when bone marrow fails to make enough white blood cells .
The report noted that levamisole was found in some of the people with agranulocytosis and cocaine exposure .
But the reports of tissue death associated with contaminated cocaine are newer , said Dr. Kurt Nolte , a pathology professor at the University of New Mexico and one of the authors of the CDC report .
" Tissue death has been associated with levamisole in a clinical context , " when the drug was used therapeutically , he said .
" I 've not seen any cocaine users with this . "
But it 's not a surprise , given the amount of cocaine that has been laced with the medication , said Dr. Juliet VanEenwyk , an epidemiologist with the Washington State Department of Health , who also contributed information to the CDC report .
" The increase ( in cocaine containing levamisole ) has been really rapid , " she said .
Until a few years ago , she said , probably less than 10 % of cocaine supplies had it .
Now , experts suspect that 80 % do .
Dumyati said that the skin problem is treatable , but " if you stop using cocaine , most of the cases would get better . "
Agranulocytosis , on the other hand , is a serious illness that requires hospitalization for treatment , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .

NetApp has threatened Ethernet and ZFS storage supplier Coraid with implied legal action unless it stops selling its EtherDrive Z-series NAS .
Coraid has buckled under the threat and temporarily withdrawn the product .
The back story here is that NetApp sued Sun in 2007 for infringing its patents with the ZFS file system product which it used in its 7000 storage system and which it made available to the open source community .
Sun counter - sued NetApp to destroy the validity of the patents in question by showing that there was prior art - existing IP - rendering the patents null and void .
The two legal actions were combined , with the case ongoing in a northern California court .
Oracle has inherited the case with its acquisition of Sun .
A letter from Coraid 's CEO , Kevin Brown , to Coraid users and partners says NetApp and Oracle are trying to resolve the dispute out of court .
Now we see a significant hardening of NetApp 's stance as it directly attacks the open source community using ZFS with this offensive against Coraid .
This could be part of a negotiating tactic against Oracle .
One outcome is that Oracle agrees to license the relevant patents pertaining to ZFS from NetApp .
This would then open the way for Coraid and other ZFS - using storage suppliers to have to license them as well , significantly upsetting their business models unless the license fees are set low .
Another outcome is that litigious Larry goes to court .
He 's not inexperienced in such manoeuvres ; witness the Americas Cup yacht race shenanigans .
It is possible that GreenBytes and Nexenta have also received letters from NetApp 's lawyers relating to their use of ZFS .
Compellent uses Nexenta 's ZFS in its NAS head .
The ripples spread .
NetApp is likely to face some criticism for attacking a small supplier like Coraid .
It might say that , faced with someone using its stolen property supplied by a third party , Oracle - Sun , with whom it is in a legal dispute , what is it expected to do ?
It can expected to be told to wait until the Oracle - NetApp dispute is resolved and stop using little guys as pawns in a much bigger game . ®

The American Humanist Association expressed enthusiastic approval today of the Supreme Court ’s affirmation of the 9th Circuit Court ’s decision allowing the California Hastings College of the Law to deny recognition to a Christian - only student group .
“ The Supreme Court ’s decision in CLS v. Martinez recognizes the important purposes served by nondiscrimination policies at public universities .
Equality , not religious based discrimination , is the core American principle here , ” said Bob Ritter , attorney and legal coordinator of the Appignani Humanist Legal Center .
“ As the American Humanist Association asked in its friend of the court brief , the Court found that Hastings ’ ‘ all comers ’ policy is a reasonable , viewpoint neutral condition for using the schools facilities , funds and channels of communication , ” said Ritter .
“ Consequently , the policy did not transgress First Amendment limitations . ”
The Christian Legal Society ( CLS ) sued the California Hastings College of the Law in 2004 after being barred from school funding , priority access to facilities and use of Hasting ’s logo .
This ban was in response to the CLS ’s exclusion of non-Christians and gays from voting and leadership positions .
The CLS was denied its exemption request from the school ’s non-discrimination policy , which prohibited student groups from discriminating on the basis of “ race , color , religion , national origin , ancestry , disability , age , sex or sexual orientation . ”
The District Court ruled this policy permissible and viewpoint neutral , an opinion echoed in the Supreme Court ’s decision .
“ Although the First Amendment may protect the CLS ’s discriminatory practices off campus , ” wrote Justice John Paul Stevens in the concurring opinion , “ it does not require a public university to validate and support them . ”
In the majority opinion , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also noted the group ’s capability to remain intact without official status and rejected the CLS ’s assertion that unsympathetic students could sabotage the Christian group and gain control .
“ This decision is a victory for humanists and students alike , ” said Roy Speckhardt , executive director of the American Humanist Association .
“ Discrimination should n’t be university - funded .
With this ruling , students can remain confident that their tuition money wo n’t be given to groups intending to exclude them . ”
The American Humanist Association ( www.americanhumanist.org ) advocates for the rights and viewpoints of humanists and others who advocate that one can be good without a belief in God.
Founded in 1941 and headquartered in Washington , D.C. , its work is extended through more than 100 local chapters and affiliates across America .

Olympic athletes are wondering what impact the U.S. Olympic Committee 's multimillion - dollar sponsorship deal with BP could have on their future , given the continued bad news coming from the Gulf Coast oil spill .
American athletes receive money from the USOC , some of which comes via the BP sponsorship .
The oil company signed a deal with the USOC in February worth between $ 10 million and $ 15 million , which represents about 6 percent to 7 percent of the federation 's sponsorship revenue .
The London 2012 Olympic organizing committee also has a deal with BP , valued at around $ 58 million .
And next weekend 's all - Chicago baseball series between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox is sponsored by BP .
In an era where big companies pull back on deals with athletes because of their behavior -- see Tiger Woods -- the benefactors of BP 's millions are not telegraphing any moves to turn the tables .
In interviews with The Associated Press , they did not acknowledge any risks that could go along with holding onto the BP partnership .
Nor would they directly answer when asked if any thought had been given to parting ways .
Agent Evan Morgenstein said he has received a number of calls from athletes he represents who are concerned about the connections .
Among Morgenstein 's clients are Olympic swimmers Dara Torres , Amanda Beard , Aaron Peirsol and Eric Shanteau , though Morgenstein would not divulge which athletes were contacting him about BP .
" In the end , it 's not about the $ 15 million , " Morgenstein said .
" It 's about the brand .
They [ in the Olympic movement ] talk about branding all the time and the value of the rings .
If they 're not starting to get the feeling that the rings are covered in oil , then they should wait a while and do nothing .
Then , trust me , the rings will be soaked in oil . "
The Cubs and White Sox will play for the " BP Crosstown Cup " -- a play on the series title , the " Crosstown Classic . "
But much of the BP promotional material has been put to the side for obvious reasons .
" It 's unfortunate , the timing of it , but we do stand behind them during this difficult time , " said Wally Hayward , the chief of sales and marketing for the Cubs .
The other sports groups are taking the same stance .
Despite the specter of environmental disaster , criminal investigations and massive cleanup bills , along with the possibility of protests surrounding their BP - sponsored events , the White Sox are sticking with their sponsorship pact , as are the USOC and the London coordinating committee .
" BP is a valued partner to London 2012 , and they are keeping us regularly updated on events in the Gulf of Mexico , " London 2012 spokeswoman Joanna Manning - Cooper said .
" Whilst a team of specialists are focused on resolving the situation in the Gulf of Mexico , it is business as usual for the rest of the organization . "
A BP spokesman did not address a question about the environment but said the company still plans to honor all its sports sponsorships .

The White Sox would not reveal the financial details behind the BP sponsorship , though it does n't figure to make up a significant part of either their or the Cubs ' operating budget .
The situation with the USOC is different .
The nonprofit federation was having trouble signing sponsors for the current Olympic cycle when BP stepped in with a deal through at least 2012 .
That deal was estimated to be worth between $ 10 million and $ 15 million and the prospect of losing that chunk of money would leave the USOC scrambling with the Summer Olympics two years away .
Spokesman Patrick Sandusky said the USOC is in contact with BP , but mainly about the situation in the Gulf , not about the sponsorship situation , which he insists remains solid .
" This is a terrible accident that has affected an untold number of people as well as our environment , " Sandusky said .
" We trust that BP will continue to act aggressively to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , to address the damage that has been done and to ensure that this tragedy is not repeated . "
In a fortunate twist for both sides , the deal was signed only a few months ago and BP has n't come up with the promotional material to " activate " its sponsorship .
When it does , though , it will have to use a different strategy than it originally conceived .
When the deal was signed , BP officials made a big point of wanting to connect with the Olympic movement because they felt their company and the Olympics had the same , environmentally conscious values at their core .
A BP spokesman said the company still plans to honor all its sports sponsorships .
" Our Olympics sponsorships were driven by our presence as major employer and investor in the two countries [ U.S. and UK ] and our ability to provide energy in various forms to the necessary logistics efforts during the Games , " BP spokesman Robert Wine wrote in an e-mail .
Wine did not address a specific question about the environmental angle .
Morgenstein said the USOC and London organizing committee are taking a risk with their positions .
He said there could be several bad consequences , including protests and a possible boycott of the London Games , and that the athletes contacting him are wary of sitting back and doing nothing .
" This could be a humongous stain on the USOC , " Morgenstein said .
" The athletes have to seriously consider the ramifications .
They 're all talking about it .
It 's not something that missed their eye . "
The new feminist housewives :
How the latest generation of graduates are choosing full time motherhood over high - flying careers
The last time Ellen Fletcher saw her university friends they were graduating from one of London 's top colleges with the world at their feet .
Four years on , they all boast high - flying careers as City executives - all except Ellen .
And when she reveals how she 's chosen to spend the intervening years to them , their jaws drop .
' They could n't believe it when I told them I have chosen to be a full - time mother , ' says the 27 - year - old , who lives in South - West London with her husband Richard , 30 , a teacher , and her children George , four , and Verity , two .
' I could tell from their reaction that they could n't help assuming I must be bored stiff - but that is simply just not the case .
House proud : English graduate Poppy Pickles , with daughter Rosanna , three , gave up a career at Sotheby 's auction house to become a mother
' Of course , there are days when I am untying my pinny , my hands covered in flour from baking a cake , when I think of all the glamorous things I could be doing with my life .
' But then , when I see the look on my children 's faces as they hand me drawings or I read them a story , I know that what I am doing is just so worthwhile . '
And Ellen is not alone in holding what many women might perceive as an antiquated view - a growing number of young , well - educated British women are striking back at the have - it - all generation and choosing motherhood over careers .
After decades during which the number of women who work has steadily increased , it appears the tide is turning back to a more traditional family model .
In America , these strident young mums refer to themselves as ' home managers ' - the choice of words an assertion of the value they see in their chosen ' career ' .
And the last thing they feel is downtrodden or tied to the kitchen sink .
' There 's a kind of radicalism about stay - at - home mums that 's emerging , ' says Justine Roberts , one of the founders of the influential parenting website mumsnet.com .
' Whereas some women used to hate saying they were full - time mothers , there 's a trend towards giving up work and being out and proud about it .
It 's not a thing to be ashamed of any more . '
What 's also clear is that many more mothers would follow suit if they could .
A survey revealed that 52 per cent of mothers return to work because they cannot afford to stay at home bringing up their children .
Only a small minority , just 22 per cent , return because they actually want to continue their career .
' Despite women being told that they can " have it all , " and can choose whether to be a working or stay - at - home mum , the fact is that most have this choice stripped away from them by the financial realities of modern life , ' says Ann Robinson , a director at uswitch.com , the price comparison website which carried out the survey .
' Of course there are days when I think of all the glamorous things I could be doing with my life '
As far as Ellen is concerned , though , it all comes down to having the right priorities .
In her view , it is entirely possible to survive on one income - but you have to be prepared to live a far simpler life .
' We have very little money , ' she says .
We live on my husband 's salary in a two - up , two - down , terraced house and there is nothing left over for any extras .
' This summer , we 're taking a tent to West Wittering .
None of us has had new clothes for ages .
We drive one car , a Ford Focus , and we allow ourselves one meal out a month . '
But the rewards , she says , more than make up for the lack of material luxuries .
' I wake up excited about each day - whether I am taking the children to the park or we 're drawing and reading at home .
I find it so fulfilling .'
Ellen , 27 , had a brief taste of a career after graduating with a modern languages degree from King 's College London in 2003 .
She got a job as a legal secretary in the Spanish department of a law firm .
But equally as important to her was her relationship with Richard , whom she met when she was 16 and married in her final year at university .
Her overriding ambition was not to climb the career ladder , but to settle down and have children straight away .
She gave up work when she fell pregnant with George in 2005 and has never looked back .
' I missed the social life at first , but I was very determined that motherhood was going to be my vocation .
I am the first of my university friends to have children , but I have absolutely no regrets . '
Priority : Ellen Fletcher has always wanted to be a wife and mother
Feminists may prickle at her choice , but Ellen is unrepentant .
' I have always wanted to be a wife and mother , ' she says .
' My priority in life is to create a welcoming , warm home and have home - cooked food on the table .
' My mother , a speech therapist , tried to combine work and motherhood but she found it really stressful so I decided it was n't even worth trying .
' It 's a steep learning curve living on one salary , but it 's not impossible . '
History graduate Kate Wheatcroft is also prepared to make financial sacrifices in order to pursue motherhood .
' I just laugh when people try and patronise me , because I feel that what I am doing is the most worthwhile thing , ' says the 26 - year - old from Bolton who is married to Paul , 28 , a mortgage advisor .
' I could be earning a fortune - but then I would be paying someone a fortune to look after my children . '
The number of women giving birth over 35 has tripled since the Eighties as women delay motherhood to pursue a career .
But Kate was not prepared to wait .
She was 22 when she had her son Finlay , now four .
' A lot of my friends thought I was too young to be settling down and that I was wasting my degree .
But I get job satisfaction out of seeing my son develop and grow .
Kate , who is due to give birth to her second child in six weeks , adds : ' The idea of leaving him with someone far less qualified than me while I go out to work does n't make any sense .
' My education was n't for nothing .
I use what I learnt to make learning fun for him .
We do so much together - swimming , football , tennis , playgroups , music groups and pre-school clubs .
' I love it at night , when we snuggle up and read books together .
Paul agrees that I 've made the right choice for all of us .
' We do n't have many meals out or designer clothes , but none of that is important to me .
We live in a two - bedroom cottage , and we would love a bigger house , but we 'll have to wait .
' Everyone has got so used to having everything they need in consumer terms , but I think you value things much more if you have to wait for them and save . '
' It 's funny , but all my high - powered friends are now rather jealous of me in this lovely weather - I 'll be planning a day in the park with Finlay while they are sitting in a hot office .
' People may might it hard to understand in this money - driven , consumer society , but I am very content . '
Kate is proud to be a trailblazer for other women who long to give up their jobs and live the Cath Kidston dream .
And so she should be , says Jill Kirby , director of the Westminster think tank the Centre for Policy Studies , who describes this new take on the work / life balance as ' maternal feminism ' .
She explains : ' Feminism should n't be defined purely in terms of the work place .
I think a very important part of choice for women is the ability to devote time to children and motherhood , too .
' Women who are choosing motherhood early and saving their careers for later are becoming mothers at a time of peak fertility and also the time when they have the energy and the enthusiasm to enjoy their children .
' Women that choose motherhood early , saving their careers for later , have the energy and the enthusiasm to enjoy their children '
' Children have really lost out by being parcelled up into day care .
Surveys show that young children thrive through getting one - to - one care from a loving adult .
' Mums are best placed to do that . '
English graduate Poppy Pickles is another highly - educated young mother who is adamant that she does n't want anyone else looking after her children Daniel , five , and Rosanna , three .
She says : ' I worked hard at school and I enjoyed university but I never saw myself as having a high - flying - career , leaving my children to be looked after by someone else .
' The best person to look after my children is me .
They are both very secure , very loved children , and they take me entirely for granted - which is what I want .
' They know Mummy is always here , and always at home for them . '
Poppy worked at Sotheby 's auction house as a researcher for a year after graduating , but she gave up her job without hesitation when she married James , a journalist , when she was 22 .
The couple live in a three - bedroom Seventies house , which they bought with help from their families .
They also keep to a budget - they have n't had a foreign holiday for six years , for example - but Poppy insists they are very content with their lives .
' The children do n't need expensive holidays to be happy .
We take them down to the Kent coast or to James 's family home in Scotland so I do n't feel they are missing out .
In fact , their lives are far richer .
' James and I have been together since I was 17 and I just knew he was " the one " .
There was no point waiting to start a family .
I think being a young mum is fabulous - I have my family now , before I'm 30 .
' By the time we are 40 we 'll have the freedom to go off travelling together and still have a life .

' I may pick up a career at that stage to bring some extra money in but it's not a burning ambition . '
Poppy is convinced she is far happier than she would be as a career women dogged by the stresses and strains of juggling work commitments with housework and childcare .
' I also think it 's good for my relationship , ' says Poppy .
' James says he loves coming home , walking back from the station , knowing that there will be a home - cooked meal on the table and the children will be bathed and happy after spending a busy day with me . '
She adds : ' I do n't feel as if feminism has passed me by - surely it is every woman 's right to choose .
I choose to be at home .
' It 's made our lives very straightforward - I 'm not tired at the end of a day 's work , and I can devote myself to being a wife as well as a mother . '
She does n't even dread that inevitable dinner party moment when she reveals she 's a housewife and mother .
' It makes me laugh when people say to me , rather pompously , at dinner parties : " And what do you do ? "
' I am not going to apologise for being a stay - at - home mum and yet people can look at you in such a pitying way , as if you 're sacrificing your ambition for the sake of your children and letting the sisterhood down .
' Not everyone fits the mould of career woman and we should n't have to apologise for it .
' I know it makes me sound like a Fifties housewife , but I love my life .
I want to see my children 's first steps , hear their first words , and be there to take them to school and pick them up .
' Those tiny moments in the day are so valuable to children , and you can never get them back . '
Over the past few weeks I have had the privilege of having over a half dozen HTC handsets at my disposal .
There are a few highlights in the mix , but none of them stand out like Sprint ’s new HTC EVO 4G .
Having attended Google I/ O two weeks ago , I was among the lucky 5,000 who walked away with a shiny new HTC EVO 4G .
I know , free gifts tend to skew reviews , but I promise to give you my fair and unbiased opinion about the handset .
For the past week and a half , the HTC EVO 4G has been pulling its weight , serving as my main device on a day - to - day basis .
Honestly , the EVO is a huge step up from my trusty T - Mobile G1 , but the impressive spec sheet may not be exaclty what the doctor ordered .
Hardware
If you have n’t read through the Sprint HTC EVO 4G ’s spec sheet , you ’re most likely in the minoroty on this site .
The EVO is equipped with a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor , 1GB of ROM , 512 MB RAM , a huge 4.3 inch screen , and an 8 MP camera capable of 720 p video recording .
The HTC EVO 4G also features a dizzying array of wireless connectivity , including FM radio , Bluetooth ® 2.1 with A2DP Stereo and EDR , Bluetooth ® 2.1 with A2DP Stereo and EDR , 3G chipset which supports EVDO Rev A , and all important name giving 4G chip for Sprint ’s new 4G WiMax network .
There ’s no doubt that the EVO 4G is one of the most powerful handsets ever built , but how does all that power and long list of impressive features play out in the real world .
Many of you know that I still use my G1 as my regular handset , so moving up to the Sprint HTC EVO 4G presented a whole new world to me .
When you first hold the EVO in your hand , the only thing you seem to notice is the 4.3 inch display which dominates the front side of the handset .
Right below the screen are hour capacitive buttons ( home , menu , back , and search ) .
Above the screen , HTC has has equipped the EVO with proximity and light sensors , along with the 1.3 MP front facing camera for video calling .
Unlike the majority of HTC ’s phones , the EVO 4G lacks and physical directional controls so you wont find a trackball or optical joystick on the front of the device .
The top side of the phone features the 3.5 mm headphone jack and the power button and on the right side you will find the volume controls .
Along the bottom of the EVO is the microphone right next to the microUSB and HDMI ports .
Flipping the phone over you will notice the red accented 8 MP camera with dual LED flash and speaker near the top , an chrome HTC logo towards the middle .
Sprint has placed their 4G logo towards the bottom , right above the brushed aluminum kickstand .
Prying off the back cover reveals a bright red interior ( similar to the DROID Incredible ) .
Removing the 1500 mAh battery you will be able to access the microSD card which is held in place by an odd latch mechanism .
The overall design of the hardware is uniform and sleek .
HTC designed the EVO with slightly sloping sides so that the phone appears less wide on the front than it actually is .
This design trick works really well when you place the phone side by side with the Nexus One or the DROID Incredible , but once you hold the phone in your hand you really get a sense of how large the phone really it .
As you might imagine , holding a phone with a 4.3 inch display may feel a little awkward , but that feeling soon becomes a distant thought when the screen is on and your flicking through your apps or playing one of the many 3D games from the Android Market .
The 1GHz processor definitely has enough power for those looking to take full advantage of the more demanding apps on the Android Market .
3D games are smooth and web page load times are much quicker than what I have been used to with my G1 .
If you thought that surfing the web on the Nexus One with its 3.7 inch screen was enjoyable , the massive 4.3 inch display on the EVO will simply blow your mind .
But video playback is where the massive display really comes into its own .
720 p mp4 files are crystal clear and play without a glitch .
Lower quality video looks great as well , though there are very few streaming media options in the Market that do n’t look heavily pixelated on the large display .
But honestly , the display is as much as a negative feature as it is a positive one .
Using the EVO 4G is as much of a hassle as it is a pleasure .
The beuaty of most handsets is that they can be operated with a single hand , but that is nearly an impossible feat with the HTC EVO 4G .
You can manage single hand operation for a few seconds , but once you get into an app , you will find yourself holding the phone with one hand while using the other to navigate the touch screen .
Fitting the Sprint EVO into your pocket is also a bit of a hassle .
It ’s nearly impossible to fit the phone into jeans pockets but a loose pair of Khakis or cargo pants / shorts should do the trick .
Due to the large size , I actually found myself carrying the EVO in my hand a lot more since it was less of a hassle than trying to get it in and out of my pockets .
Camera
The HTC EVO 4G is equipped with an 8 MP camera with dual LED flash on the back .
For the most part , I ’m sure that we all know that megapixels does not translate into better pictures , but the EVO does appear to have a leg up over the competition .
The auto - focus lens does a great job of giving the user control .
HTC ’s camera app allows you to touch the screen to indicate what should be in focus .
Surprisingly , the lens does good job of focusing on items as close at 4 inches from it .
The focus precision allows you create some pretty dramatic images since it throws the background of the images out of focus .
Indoor pictures come out sharp as well , but the sensors present high ISO does add in substantial graininess as your interior surroundings get darker .
The dual LED flash that HTC was equipped the EVO 4G with go an average job of lighting up dark subjects .
Getting the flash to work just right is a bit hard .
In a dark room you want to make sure that your subject is between four and six feet away from the EVO when using the flash .
Anything closer than four feet will appear washed out , while anything further than 6 feet will appear too dark .
I would recommend using the flash in indoor situations , even if there is enough natural lighting since the extra lights appear to reduce the amount ISO graininess from the sensor .
One of the unique features of the HTC EVO 4G is the inclusion of the 1.3 MP front facing camera .
QIK will be rolling out an updated version of their app this week which will support two way video calling but you may have hear that Fring beat them to the punch last week with their new Skype video calling integration .
While everyone else will be able to do video calling , it ’s just a bit awkward when you have to flip your phone back and fourth .
The front facing camera will give you the same experience as you get with a web - cam on a computer .
We tested out the QIK video calling when in New York city a few weeks back .
The quality is much better than what Fring is currently offering , but you ’ll be limited to video calling only with other QIK users .
Fring ’s
Skype integration is a lot more practical , but we ’re hoping Skype own video calling app update later this year will bring a much needed video quality boost .
Since the HTC EVO 4G is a monster or a phone , the camera would n’t be complete without the ability to record 720 p video .
Now , I ’m not going to get into whole debate about quality of HD video , but I will point out that what you get with the HTC EVO 4G is not what you can expect form a dedicated 720 p camcorder or even your new little SONY point and shoot camera you got your mom this past Christmas .
Daylight video with the HTC EVO 4G comes out nice and clear .
Just make sure you have a steady hand and things should come out exactly like you want .
The only time you may notice some real quality issues is when you paly back the clips on an HDTV .
Indoor video recording is a much different experience .
With lower light levels , the EVO ’s HD video sensor compensated by increasing the ISO , adding a lot a graininess .
The resulting video is still decent , though you will be able to notice the lower quality even when playing back clips on the handset .
Unfortunately , the EVO ’s HD video recording feature is completely useless is low light situations .
Things might have been a little different if HTC added a setting to enable the LED flash while recording video .
For now , my recommendation would be to skip video recording when things are a little too dark and simply take a few pictures instead .
Software
As we have come to expect with all new HTC handsets , the Sprint HTC EVO 4G comes with HTC Sense loaded on top of Android 2.1 .
I know , Android 2.1 is old news these days since Android 2.2 ( Froyo ) was just unveiled at Google I/O. HTC did announce that they will be bringing Froyo to all their 2010 Android phones before the ned of the year , so all we have to do is wait .
The latest version of HTC Sense has a few new tricks up its sleeve .
As always , Sense integrated your Facebook information with your contacts , pulling in pictures , birthdays , and even your friends latest status updates .
But in the past , all this information only lived within the contacts or people app .
Now , HTC has added a new app and widget called FriendStream which pulls all the latest news from your friends on Facebook and Twitter and aggregates them all in one place .
When you ’re inside the application you can sort through all the updates and organize them by status update , links , or photos .
HTC has also incorporated all your Facebook friends ’ birthdays into the calendar .
Sprint TV , Sprint Navigation , and Nascar Sprint Cup Mobile appear to be unchanged form what we seen on the Sprint HTC Hero , but I thought I would mention that the NFL app has now been replaced with Sprint Football Live since Verizon recently signed a deal with the NFL to feature their official app for mobile .
The only Sprint app really worth talking about is Sprint Mobile Hotspot .
The HTC EVO 4G is Sprint first smartphone with their 4G WiMax integration , so they thought it would only be appropriate to included hotspot functionality so you can share those blazing fast 4G speeds .
If you in one of Sprint ’s 4g markets , you can connect up to eight devices to your HCT EVO .
But is 3G is all you have , Sprint limits the number of connections to two .
Not being in a 4G market , I ca n’t give any details on the reliability of the network or the download speeds , but I have used Sprint Hotspot over 3G quite a bit since I got my hands on the EVO .
The first thing I actually used the app for was to download the OTA Android 2.1 update for the DROID Eris since the demo phone did n’t have a data connection .
Download speeds over 3G seem to average 1.1 Mbps while uploads are around 350 Kbps .
The speeds are n’t any higher than what I ’m used to over wired or wireless tethering from my G1 on T - Mobile ’s network , though it ’s nice to know that the tethering option on the EVO 4G is officially sanctioned by Sprint and not a back door hack .
If you do happen to find yourself in a 4G market , you should expect to get an average of 4 - 6 Mbps download speeds even though Sprint ’s network can handle up to 10 M Bps bursts .
Battery
The 1500 mAh battery can definitely keep up with medium to heavy usage .
For me , an average day with an android phone includes 1 hour of music , 30 - 40 minutes of web browsing , one or two 22 minute TV shows , 20 minutes for gaming ( I am really enjoying Home Run Battle 3D ) , 30 minutes of phone calls , 10 - 15 sms , and Twitter and Gmail access throughout the day .
I typically unplug the phone at 7 am and found that I still had 15 - 25 % battery life when plugging it back in at 8 pm .
Keep in mind that I am not in a 4G market and that I manually se my screen brightness to 15 % .
If you use the preset brightness options with the Power Control widget you will notice a significant increase in power consumption from the display .
Conclusion
It ’s really not an easy job , looking at the Sprint HTC EVO 4G with a critical eye .
The phone has some much to offer , so much to love , but that does not mean it ’s perfect in every way .
For me , 4G and the 4.3 inch display are the two best selling point for the phone , but when you hold the EVO 4G in your hand , the benefits of the two features seem to melt away .
The promise of 4G speeds on a mobile device is almost like a dream come true , but for most of us 4G is still a dream .
Sprint is aggressively rolling out 4G in new markets right now , but their roll - out of new markets will still leave the majority of their U.S customers in 3G by the end of the year .
On top of that , Sprint plans on charging an extra $ 10 for data service on the EVO since it has the potential to consume more data than standard 3G smartphones .
Sprint is also planning on charging an additional $ 29.99 for the Hotspot app if you really want it .
The EVO 4 G ’s screen is both a blessing and a curse .
Media , apps , and the internet look stunning on the huge display , but the EVO feels more like a small tablet than a phone .
Apparently , HTC knew that people would n’t want to hold the phone all the time , so they included a kickstand for when the EVO gets a little too heavy .
But if you can get past those two issues , the HTC EVO 4G offers one of the most amazing Android experiences available .
Compare the HTC EVO to the original HTC Desire or the Nexus One and you can clearly see that the EVO is in a league of its own .
Maybe we should think of the HTC EVO 4G as a mythical monster .
It ’s incredibly fast and has some amazing powers that no one has ever seen before .
It ’s size is impressive , but unfortunately there is nothing you can do to tame the beast .
Many will shy away from something this amazing simply because of the size , but there are those who are willing to take on the challenge and be known to others as the one who tried to tame the beast .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China said on Tuesday it was concerned about reports that a U.S. aircraft carrier may join a military exercise with South Korea amid a tense standoff with North Korea over the sinking of a warship from the South .
People look around a model of the South Korean Navy 's Chamsuri class patrol boat No. 357 , which was sunk during the second Yeonpyeong sea battle between the two Koreas in 2002 , at the Korean War Memorial Museum in Seoul June 20 , 2010 , five days ahead of the 60th anniversary of the Korean War on June 25 .

The South Korean corvette the Cheonan was sunk off the peninsula ’s west coast in March , killing 46 sailors .
South Korea has blamed the North for sinking the Cheonan with a torpedo fired from a submarine , a charge the North denies .
The United States and South Korea have since said they will hold a joint anti-submarine drill .
[ ID :nTOE64N00Y ]
Some news reports , including one in the Washington Post newspaper , have said Pentagon officials are considering sending an aircraft carrier to take part in the exercise in the Yellow Sea off South Korea ’s western coast .
Seoul says an international inquiry showed there was no doubt North Korea sank the Cheonan but Beijing , North Korea ’s only real ally and benefactor , has reacted much more cautiously .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said he had seen the reports about the U.S. aircraft carrier joining the drill .
“ We ’re extremely concerned about these reports and will closely follow developments , ” he told a news conference .
He said China was worried the show of naval force could unsettle the region .
“ Under current circumstances , all the parties concerned should exercise calm and restraint and do nothing to escalate tensions and harm the interests of countries in this region , ” Qin said .
North Korea said the planned exercises were part of a “ dangerous scheme to disturb the peace , ” the state news agency KCNA quoted a major daily as saying on Tuesday .
“ The situation of the Korean Peninsula is now at the crucial phase in which an all - out war may break out any moment .
Therefore , the reckless joint military exercises projected under such a situation cannot be construed otherwise than a scenario to ignite another Korean war . ”
China has resisted calls from Seoul , Washington and Tokyo to join in condemning Pyongyang over the Cheonan sinking , instead saying it needed to assess the competing claims .
Qin repeated that position on Tuesday .
Beijing has also been irked by U.S. navy ships engaging in surveillance in waters close to China ’s southern coast .
Director James Cameron has seen plenty of parodies of his science fiction film " Avatar " , but porn giant Hustler is the first to offer a take on the mega - blockbuster in three dimensions .
The studio arm of the company has announced that the upcoming porn version of the film , titled " This Ain’t Avatar XXX " , will be presented in 3 - D. Such are the production costs , that Hustler is calling it their highest - budget flick ever produced .
I can only guess at the content — which may or may not carry on Cameron 's environmental message .
Either way , you 're sure to witness lots of blue - painted porn stars dressed up as Na'vi and , naturally , getting it on .
" But wait a minute ! " , you say .
" I thought the Na'vi did n't have sexual organs like humans ? ! "
Right you are , my useless knowledge cohort !
In fact , a deleted sex scene from the original film showed the two main characters " mating " by hooking their tails together .
Something tells me Hustler may choose to use a little artistic license in achieving the desired effect .
" This Ain’t Avatar XXX " , which just wrapped production , will be available in September .
Pentagon - backed scientists are getting ready to test thought - controlled prosthetic arms on human subjects , by rewiring their brains to fully integrate the artificial limbs .
Already in recent years , we 've seen very lifelike artificial arms , monkeys nibbling bananas with mind - controlled robotic limbs and even humans whose muscle fibers have been wired to prosthetic devices .
But this is the first time human brains will be opened up , implanted with a neural interface and then used to operate an artificial limb .
It 's a giant step that 'll transform the devices , which were little more than hooks and cables only 50 years ago .
And the progress is courtesy of Darpa , the Pentagon 's far - out R&D agency , who 've been sponsoring brain - controlled replacement limbs as part of their Revolutionizing Prosthetics Program .
A team of scientists at Johns Hopkins , behind much of Darpa 's prosthetic progress thus far , have received a $ 34.5 million contract from the agency to manage the next stages of the project .
Researchers will test the Modular Prosthetic Limb ( MPL ) on a human .
The test subject 's thoughts will control the arm , which " offers 22 degrees of motion , including independent movement of each finger , " provides feedback that essentially restores a sense of touch , and weighs around 9 pounds .
That 's about the same weight as a human arm .
The prosthetic will rely on micro-arrays , implanted into the brain , that record signals and transmit them to the device .
It 's a similar design to that of the freaky monkey mind - control experiments , which have been ongoing at the University of Pittsburgh since at least 2004 .
Within two years , Johns Hopkins scientists plan to test the prosthetic in five patients .
And those researchers , alongside a Darpa - funded consortium from Caltech , University of Pittsburgh , University of Utah and the University of Chicago , also hope to expand prosthetic abilities to incorporate pressure and touch .
" The goal is to enable the user to more effectively control movements to perform everyday tasks , such as picking up and holding a cup of coffee , " Michael McLoughlin , the project 's program manager , says .
In other words , prosthetic arms that are remarkably similar to the real thing .
But the long - term caliber of the MPL arm remains an open question .
Just three months ago , Darpa launched a new program to overcome several problems with neuro - prosthetic models – most notably , the two - year lifespan of those implanted neural recording devices .

The surface of the Red Planet was shaped by water on a global scale
The whole of Mars ' surface was shaped by liquid water around four billion years ago , say scientists .
Signs of liquid water had been seen on southern Mars , but the latest findings reveal similar signals in craters in the north of the Red Planet .
The team made their discovery by examining data from instruments on board Europe 's Mars Express and Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
They report the findings in the latest issue of the journal Science .
John Carter , of the University of Paris , led the team of France - and US - based scientists .
" Until now , we had no idea what half Mars was made of in terms of mineral composition , " he told BBC News .
We 're seeing signals of what were once river beds , small seas and lakes John Carter , University of Paris
" Now , with the Esa and Nasa probes , we have been able to get a mixture of images and spectral information about the composition of the rock . "
He explained that these instruments had revealed clay - type minerals called phyllosilicates - " the stuff you would find in mud and in river beds . "
" It 's not the species of mineral itself that 's important , " said Dr Carter , " it 's more the fact that the minerals contain water .
" This enhances the picture of liquid water on Mars . "
Liquid rock
Previously , researchers have seen similar signs of water in the highlands of southern Mars in rocks that are up to four billion years old .
But in the northern part of the planet , more recently formed rocks have buried the older geology .
The prevailing theory for why this is , is that a giant object slammed into northern Mars , turning nearly half of the planet 's surface into the Solar System 's largest impact crater .
Image caption
The team found the minerals in craters in the northern part of Mars
Dr Carter explained that this meant a thick veneer of younger rock covered the older geology , " so the craters are the only way of accessing the older stuff " .
But the craters are relatively small and more difficult for the orbiting probes to take measurements from .
" There 's also ice and dust coverage in the north of the planet , making it harder to get signals from these craters , " said Dr Carter .
The new findings suggest that at least part of the wet period on Mars , that could have been favourable to life , extended into the time between that giant impact and when volcanic and other rocks formed an overlying mantle .
This indicates that , 4.2 billion years ago , the planet was probably altered by liquid water on a global scale .
But Dr Carter said that the findings did not paint a picture of huge Martian oceans .
" It was probably a very dry place , " he said .
" But we 're seeing signals of what were once river beds , small seas and lakes . "

I did not expect Judge Feldman to grant the stay , customary in cases to be appealed .
Either his person oil interests render him too corrupt , or his GOP ideology renders him too activist , or both .
The Obama administration ’s efforts to suspend deepwater oil drilling were dealt another setback in court on Thursday when the federal judge who struck down the administration ’s six - month moratorium refused to delay the decision ’s effects .
The Interior Department petitioned Judge Martin L.C. Feldman of the United States District Court in New Orleans to grant a stay of his decision , which lifted a ban on new drilling projects and on work on the 33 rigs already in place in the Gulf .
But Judge Feldman said he was denying the delay for the same reasons he gave for his June 22 decision : that the moratorium was doing “ irreparable harm ” to the businesses in the gulf that depend on drilling activity and that the government had not given sufficient basis for the moratorium .
The White House imposed the moratorium in May , about a month after a fatal explosion and fire on April 20 on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which left an undersea well spewing crude oil into the gulf .
The moratorium , intended to give time for improvements in rig safety measures , was “ blanket , generic , indeed punitive , ” the judge ruled .
Judge Feldman said on Thursday that the Interior Department now had 30 days to comply with his June 22 decision , a longer time than the 21 days he originally specified in his ruling .
The government ’s appeal of the ruling will be heard by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Meanwhile , Ken Salazar , the Interior secretary , plans to reintroduce the moratorium in another version in the next several days , emphasizing why the moratorium is necessary in answer to the judge ’s criticism .
Judge Feldman ’s ruling on Thursday , denying the stay , held few surprises , given his ruling on Tuesday , but it did not mean that drilling would resume immediately .
“ Does this mean companies are going to rush back to work ? ” asked Andy Radford , the senior policy advisor for offshore issues with the American Petroleum Institute .
“ There are probably too many unknowns to get a large - scale resumption of work at this point . ”
Mr. Radford said Mr. Salazar has been talking about a “ flexible ” moratorium that could be more beneficial than the original blanket ban .
It could identify “ a framework where companies can meet safety requirements and have equipment inspected and get back to work while we figure what exactly is going on , ” Mr. Radford said … [ emphasis added ]
Oakland , Calif .
IN 1972 , a TV commercial changed the way Americans looked at kosher food .
It showed Uncle Sam munching on a Hebrew National beef hot dog as a heavenly voice assures him it is free of the additives and byproducts present in lesser processed meats .
“ We answer to a higher authority , ” the voice proclaims .
Trust us — we ’re kosher .
That message resonated at a time when Americans were growing increasingly mistrustful of the government and were starting to worry about what dangerous hidden substances might be on their dinner plates .
Today , a majority of Americans believe that kosher food is safer , healthier , better in general than non -kosher food .
And they ’re willing to pay more for it .
Kosher is the fastest - growing segment of the domestic food industry , with bigger sales than organic .
One - third to one - half of the food in American supermarkets is kosher - certified , representing more than $ 200 billion of the country ’s estimated $ 500 billion in annual food sales , up from $ 32 billion in 1993 .
Given that Jews make up less than 2 percent of the population , and most of them do n’t keep kosher , it ’s clear that the people buying this food are mostly non-Jews .
While some consumers probably are n’t aware that their pasta or cookies are kosher , many are folks who believe that “ higher authority ” promise .
The Hebrew National campaign also captured a pivotal moment in American Jewish history : a newly confident but still largely immigrant community , basking in Israel ’s victory in the June 1967 war , was almost reflexively looking back over its shoulder , not quite sure of its position in the majority - Christian society .

Editor ’s Note :
When I met Estrella Rosenberg April 8 at the Nonprofit Technology Conference , she told me about the Foursquare 100×100 campaign to launch two days later .
No one had used Foursquare in this way previously , and I immediately knew she was on to a breakthrough idea .
I asked her to send me a writeup once it was over , and this is her guest post below .
When April 1st rolled around I had been investigating how non-profits use Foursquare and brainstorming how they could use it for a couple of months .
Although not a direct method of fundraising my thoughts were still along those lines … and then a question popped into my head .
Could Foursquare be used for awareness and advocacy ?
1 in 100 children are born with a heart defect .
My two nonprofits Big Love Little Hearts and One Hundred Squared serve the Congenital Heart Defect ( CHD ) community .
When was the 100th day of the year ?
It happened to be nine days later , April 10th .
My next question was : “ could I come up with a campaign in nine days , launch it and have it be successful ? ”
I had no idea but I ’m not afraid of failure so I set out to create a Foursquare experiment .
The basic premise was this – we created a hashtag , # 100X100 , that stood for 1 in 100 on the 100th day of the year .
I created a website , http://onehundredsquared.com to explain what it was , why it was important and to determine the actions we wanted supporters to take : spread awareness using the hashtag and call / write their representatives asking them to support the Congenital Heart Futures Act and Pulse - Ox screening of CHD to the National Newborn Screening Panel .
We also created a Facebook fanpage and Twitter profile .
We recruited volunteers to commit to a guerrilla , grass - roots effort to use Foursquare to parlay our message .
On the evening of April 9th a few dozen Big Love Little Hearts volunteers added the following as a “ tip ” to 600 Foursquare locations : “ 1in100 children are born w/ a heart defect .
Pulse - Ox screening saves lives – you can too !
Check in with the hashtag # 100X100 . ”
We also embedded a link in the tip to the One Hundred Squared website .
We chose what we thought would be the most checked - in locations on a Saturday : airports , Starbucks ’ , Target ’s , gym ’s , etc. in every major city .
One of the benefits of using Foursquare as an origin point is that most people who use it sync their check-ins to Twitter and Facebook .
This meant that one person checking with # 100X100 had the possibility of being viewed across three different platforms with three audiences .
Talk about bang for your ( time ) buck !
Did it work ?
Better than I could have possibly imagined .
My goal was to see how social media worked for advocacy and awareness .
However , something extraordinary happened : I began foursquaring / tweeting / facebooking about # 100X100 at 12:01 am on April 10 and Big Love Little Hearts ’ supporters followed .
At 7:30 am an angel who was following one of our followers on Twitter ( but not us ) noticed our hashtag .
( She is an adult with a CHD who was not diagnosed at birth and who is alive today because she received lifesaving surgery . )
Her passion for our work led her to call me and commit to donating $ 1 for every time someone used the # 100X100 hashtag until midnight April 10th .
How much did we raise ?
She gave me a cap of $ 25,000 .
I knew the moment she said it that as a not - quite ten month old organization we would n’t reach the cap .
Much to my surprise our supporters were so engaged that we reached it by almost half .
At quarter to midnight the hashtag had been used 11,703 times across all three platforms .
Our donor was so impressed that she committed all $ 25,000 , which funded 12 surgeries in developing countries .
Twelve lives saved in 24 hours .
That ’s great ( okay , FANTASTIC ) , but did it work for advocacy and awareness ?
YES !
Less than two weeks after the 100th day of the year about 100 people from various CHD groups were to meet in Washington for CHD Lobby Day .
The One Hundred Squared website , as linked through Foursquare and the hashtag , asked people to contact their representatives .
We wanted to plant a seed for anyone who used # 100X100 on the 10th to call their Senator or Congressman and let them know that they supported measures that would greatly improve the lives of the 2 million people living with CHD in the states .
On the April 22 ( CHD Lobby Day ) we used the hashtag via Twitter , Facebook and Foursquare to remind our supporters to call their legislators .
By noon more people had looked at the website than the entirety of April 10 .
I had seven appointments with Senators & Congressman from Illinois that day .
There was n’t a single one I walked into where their aide did n’t inform me that constituents had been calling about this all day .
People Lobby
Day delegates from other states texted or called me to say the same .
More than 500 people told me that they had contacted their representative , and 300 others contacted the Big Love office to do the same .
1800 + viewed the page and clicked through the link to find their representative .
I cried with pride the entire day .
What was the benefit of using Foursquare as our social - media springboard ?
The tips we left are still there and will stay there perpetually .
For several locations our tip is still the most recent .
Did I mention that we have a link embedded in the tip ?
A huge “ thank you ” to everyone who participated in # 100X100 on April 10h and 22 – you made it such a success that the Big Love Little Hearts sister organization , 1 in 100 , changed its name and expanded its mission .
( Check back with http://onehundredsquared.com soon – or subscribe - for more details ) !
One last nugget – all of this was FREE .
We raised $ 25,000 , saved 12 lives in the immediate and set the stage for millions of lives to be changed .
Estrella Rosenberg is the Founder and Director of Big Love Little Hearts , One Hundred Squared , Little Leo Foundation and The 4F Club .
She writes about her love of non-profit work in her blog , Adventures In Philanthropy .
Big Love Little Hearts provides lifesaving surgery to children with congenital heart defects in developing countries .
Almost one million children are born with a heart defect worldwide every year – half will need surgery to survive .
Ninety percent will be born in countries where access to lifesaving measures is limited by economic status or lack of infrastructure .

Apolipoprotein AI Mutations and Information A reply to Answers in Genesis regarding the Apo AI Milano mutation by Ian Musgrave , Steven Pirie - Shepherd , and Douglas Theobald Our apologies , but you must have JavaScript enabled to view author contact information .

Introduction :
Glossary allele : one of several possible forms of a gene .
amino acid : a small organic molecule used as a building block for proteins .
apolipoprotein : the protein component of a lipoprotein .
apolipoprotein AI ( Apo - AI ) : the major protein for forming HDL cholesterol lipoproteins ; that is , good HDL .
cholesterol : a lipid ( fat ) which is an important part of animal cells .
It is transported through the bloodstream as lipoproteins ; but in isolation it would congeal into a solid .
dimer : a molecule formed by two identical simpler units , called monomers .
gene : a segment of DNA which contributes to the function or form of an organism .
Genes mostly work by coding for protein .
heterozygote :
An organism that carries two different alleles of the same gene .
homozygote :
An organism that carries two identical alleles of the same gene .
lipid : lipids ( fats ) are defined as substances which dissolve in alcohol but not in water .
Fats are an important part of all cells , and a major source of fuel .
lipoprotein : a particle which combines lipids and protein .
The proteins allow the particle to dissolve in water , which means that the lipid can be transported in the blood stream .
LDL , HDL : low density lipoprotein , high density lipoprotein .
Lipoproteins are characterised by their density .
LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol : Cholesterol in LDL lipoproteins is called " bad " cholesterol , because the LDL can deposit cholesterol on artery walls , restricting blood flow .
Cholesterol in HDL lipoproteins is called " good " cholesterol , because HDL can capture and remove cholesterol from the arteries and get transported out of the blood stream through the liver .
A good , simple explanation is provided by the University of Miami School of Medicine .
protein : a large organic molecule made up of amino acids linked in a chain .
n the 1980's a small Italian community was found to have a mutant version of a protein , called Apolipoprotein AI ( Apo - AI ) , which is associated with a decreased risk of arteriosclerosis ( clogged arteries ) , heart attack , and stroke ( 1 ) .
The reduction in risk in these people has been attributed to the mutant protein ( known as the Apolipoprotein AI Milano allele , henceforth referred to as Apo - AIM ) , and Apo - AIM has often been used as an example of a beneficial mutation .
Apo -AI is a lipid - binding protein and is the major component of High Density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) particles , which play an important role in removing cholesterol from cells .
Subsequent detailed research of the Apo - AIM mutation has demonstrated that it has improved biological function that directly contributes to lowering the incidence of cardiovascular disease in the individuals carrying it .
However , Answers in Genesis has a feedback response ( last accessed 2/05 / 2003 [ see Note ] ) , which claims that the mutant provides no evidence for evolution as it has lost " specificity " ( and by implication has lost " information " ) .
AiG additionally claims that the mutant Apo - AIM is restricted in its ability to form useful HDL particles .
The basis for these claims appears to be two press releases ( 2,3 ) , rather than the primary literature .
These press releases are not entirely accurate , and they appear to have been substantially misinterpreted .
Contrary to what is stated by AiG , Apo - AIM is a fully functional protein that lowers the risk of arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease by a number of mechanisms ( 4 ) .
In an experiment where reconstituted HDL particles made of Apo - AIM were infused into arteriosclerotic rabbits , the rabbits had fewer and less extensive plaques ( 4 ) .
There was decreased aortic cholesterol , and decreased cell proliferation ( both of which improve cell wall flexibility ( 4 ) ) .
While not all of the anti-arteriosclerotic actions of Apo - AIM are fully understood , we now know of two major mechanisms involved in its action .
Apo -AIM actively stimulates cholesterol removal from cells ( 5 ) , and its antioxidant ability also prevents some of the inflammatory damage in arteriosclerosis ( 6 ) .
AiG has focused on the antioxidant activity ( possibly because of its prominence in the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) press release ( 2 ) ) , claiming that this represents a loss of specificity .
In the following sections we will examine AiG 's claims more closely .
Are Apolipoprotein AI -M dimers of restricted usefulness ?
In the AiG page it is stated :
" One amino acid has been replaced with a cysteine residue in an enzyme that normally assembles high density lipoproteins ( HDLs ) , which are involved in removing ' bad ' cholesterol from arteries .
The mutant form of the enzyme is less effective at what it is supposed to do , but it does act as an antioxidant , which seems to prevent atherosclerosis ( hardening of arteries ) .
In fact , because of the added - SH on the cysteine , 70 % of the enzymes manufactured bind together in pairs ( called dimers ) , restricting their usefulness . "
This statement contains a number of inaccuracies and mistakes .
Apo -AI is a lipid - binding protein ( not an enzyme ) that forms complexes with other proteins ( like Apo - AII ) and lipids to form HDL particles .
Apo -AI can self - associate , and normally forms modest amounts of dimers , trimers and quadramers as well as being in the monomeric form , and produces HDL particles in a range of sizes ( 7 ) .
In Apo -AIM the basic amino acid arginine ( R ) at position 173 has been mutated to a sulphur - containing amino acid , cysteine ( C ; R173C ) .
This results in a greater ability to form stable dimers than Apo - AI as the two cysteines can form a chemical bond together via these sulphur groups ( 7 ) .
Despite AiG's claim that the formation of dimers results in restricting their usefulness ( this claim is not in either of the press releases ) , they are in fact fully functional .
Cholesterol removal from cells occurs primarily through reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) .
The first step in RCT is the efflux of un-esterified cholesterol from cells to suitable acceptors , normally apolipoproteins ( with or without lipids already bound ) .
This occurs through two distinct mechanisms : a ) nonspecific interaction of lipoprotein acceptors with the cell , and diffusion of cholesterol from the cell membrane onto the lipoprotein surface , and b ) interaction of lipid - free apolipoproteins with specific acceptor sites on the cell surface .
Cholesterol then diffuses into the apolipoproteins .
Both of these mechanisms depend on the structure of Apo - AI .
The Apo -AIM dimers bind to the specific Apo - AI binding site ( lecithin : cholesterol acyltransferase ; LCAT ) as efficiently as Apo - AI ( 5,7 ) and stimulates cholesterol efflux ( 5,8 ) .
Apo -AIM dimers form HDL particles as readily as Apo - AI monomers ( 7 ) , and the HDL formed from Apo - AIM stimulates cholesterol efflux more efficiently than HDL formed from Apo - AI monomers ( 5,8 ) .
Apo-AIM - containing HDL is also far more efficient at inhibiting cholesterol esterification by microsomal acylCoA : cholesterol acyltransferase ( ACAT ) , than Apo AI - containing HDL ( 5 ) .
This results in more cholesterol being released from the membrane for efflux into HDL particles .
Apo -AIM does form a more restricted size range of HDL , with predominant sizes of 7.8 , 12.7 nm ( and a rare 10.8 nm form ) , whereas Apo - AI forms particles of 7.8 , 9.6 , 12.7 and ( mostly only seen at high lipid concentrations ) 17.6 nm ( 7 ) .
This is in part because , as mentioned above , Apo - AI can form dimers and higher oligomers , while Apo - AIM can only form dimers and quadramers .
Note again that normal Apo - AI can and does dimerise , and dimeric Apo - AI is incorporated into HDL particles just as dimeric Apo - AIM is .
Despite the restricted size range , the HDL formed by Apo - AIM dimers are functional ( 5,8,7 ) .
While it was claimed in the DOE press release ( 2 ) that dimerisation is responsible for the HDL deficiency seen in people carrying the Apo - AIM gene , the dimers are actually more stable than Apo - AI monomers ( 9 ) ; indeed , part of their ability to reduce the risk of arteriosclerosis may be due to their stability , resulting in their hanging round for longer , mopping up more cholesterol and activating whatever they activate to inhibit cell proliferation ( 9 ) .
So we can see that Apo - AIM dimers are not restricted in usefulness , and do form fully functional HDL particles .
These Apo -AIM dimer HDL particles are more stable than Apo - AI HDL particles ( 9 ) , and are better than Apo - AI HDL particles at stimulating cholesterol efflux ( 5,8 ) .
Is the antioxidant activity of Apo - AIM non-specific ?
While AiG concedes that Apo - AIM has gained a new function , the antioxidant ability , they contend that this comes at the expense of specificity .
" Now in gaining an anti-oxidant activity , the enzyme has lost activity for making HDLs .
So the mutant enzyme has sacrificed a lot of specificity .
Since antioxidant activity is not a very specific activity ( a great variety of simple chemicals will act as antioxidants ) , it would seem that the net result of this mutation has been a huge loss of specificity , or , in other words , information .
This is exactly as we would expect with a random change . "
As we have seen , Apo - AIM has not lost the ability to make HDLs , so it has not sacrificed specificity .
Indeed , as Apo - AIM HDL particles are more effective at promoting cholesterol removal from cells , one could reasonably claim that there has been an increase in specificity .
However , is the antioxidant activity of Apo - AIM non-specific ?
Antioxidant activity is possessed by a number of small molecules , but so is protein hydrolysis ( catalyzed by small molecules such as the amino acid serine ) , esterification and just about all important enzyme activities .
What matters to an extent is if there is a specific sequence that binds a substrate to deliver it to the antioxidant amino acid ( in the same way the catalytic site sequence in a protein hydrolysis enzyme delivers the substrate to catalytic serine ) .
Is the antioxidant activity of Apo - AIM substrate and sequence specific ?
The answer is yes .
The antioxidant effect is sequence dependent .
The Milano mutation ( R173C ) is much more effective at inhibiting oxidation of lipids than another mutation , the Paris mutation ( R151C ) ( 6 ) .
There is also substrate specificity .
Neither mutation can quench superoxide anions in aqueous solution ( 6 ) , suggesting that the R-> C mutation does not generate a generic antioxidant , but rather a specific targeted antioxidant that will only work in a specific way .
Neither mutation is capable of preventing oxidation of a control protein ( cytochrome c ) ( 6 ) so the mutation is specific for lipid substrates .
Further studies ( 10 ) have indicated that small peptides derived from these regions ( amino acids 167 - R173C - 184 and 145-R151C - 162 ) also retain the specificity for lipids , indicating that it is not simply the presence of the cysteine , but rather the position of the cysteine within the structural constraints of the protein , that confer the healthy antioxidant properties .
Thus we can see that the antioxidant properties are specific , in the sense that they are substrate and sequence dependent .
The AiG response also implies that the dimerisation of Apo - AIM is irreversible .
In fact , cysteine dimerisation is a readily reversible reaction , and is used as a control mechanism in several proteins ( for example HSP33 ( 11 ) ) .
Dimer formation is reversible by exposure to reducing environments ( 6 ) , and while binding to arteriosclerotic plaques puts the Apo - AIM HDL in an oxidizing environment , the Apo - AI HDL also binds to a number of other cellular environments where there are coupled reduction - oxidization reactions which specifically reverse cysteine dimerisation .
Furthermore , disulphides ( R - S - S - R , where R is an organic compound or protein ) are also antioxidants in certain circumstances .
R-S - S- R compounds are quite capable of being sinks for electron oxidation ( 12 ) .
Does the Apo - AIM mutation represent a loss of information ?
The AiG page claims that information - increasing mutations are required for evolution .
The concept of " information " is a problematic one in biology , as most measures only imperfectly capture key aspects of genetic change .
Biologists prefer to think in terms of gene number and gene / protein function .
While an increase in gene number and function is not required ( parasites which have lost genes do quite nicely ) , increase in gene number has occurred .
Certainly the average vertebrate has more protein coding genes than worms or insects , and these in turn have more protein coding genes than unicellular yeast .
The basis of this increase is largely via duplication of pre-existing genes .
For example , one of the major differences between vertebrates and worms , and worms and yeasts , is an increase in the numbers of modified copies of a class of enzymes called tyrosine kinases .
By most measures of " information " a vertebrate with 30,000 genes in its genome has more information than a yeast with a mere 6,000 or so genes , and the role of gene duplication in this rise is well understood ( 13 ) .
AiG uses another definition of " information , " equating it with " specificity . "
This was originally coined by Dr .
L. Spetner , and is related to the number of substrates an enzyme binds ( the fewer substrates , the more specific the enzyme is and the more " information " it has ( 14 ) ) .
Applying this measure to non-enzymes is not entirely straightforward .
With this measure , it is claimed that random mutations do not increase " information " in a protein .
In the case of Apo - AIM , AiG claims that the mutant apolipoprotein has lost specificity as it has lost ( or restricted ) the ability to form HDL particles , and the antioxidant ability of Apo - AIM is " non-specific " .
We have seen that in fact Apo - AIM has not lost the ability to form HDL particles , and that these HDL particles that are formed bind to specific acceptor sites and are more effective at promoting cholesterol efflux than normal HDL particles .
We have also seen that the Apo - AIM antioxidant ability is both sequence and substrate specific .
Thus Apo -AIM has not lost " information " by AiG 's own measures .
If anything it has gained Spetner " information " .
After this page was made public [ 20/4/03 ]
AiG added a paragraph that expands on the concept of specificity .
Here they introduce the analogy of " fixing cars " and claim that a statement " fix the porsche " has more information than the statement " fix the car and the truck " as the latter , although having two " functions " is less specific than the first .
They then refer readers to Werner Gitt 's page .
There are two fundamental problems with this argument .
First , as we have shown above , Apo -AIM is not less specific than Apo - AI , and can be reasonably considered more specific by AiG 's very own criteria .
Apo -AIM produces a more specific range of HDL partical sizes , rather than a broader non-specific distribution , it is more specific in activating ACAT , and it specifically reverses oxidation of lipids binding to a specific recognition sequence - all of which increase the amount of information in Apo - AIM according to AiG 's logic .
Secondly , they have chosen the wrong analogy to illustrate Apo - AIM's " function " , and when applying information theory , one must be very careful of the analogy being used .
In this case , the functions are ( 1 ) increased cholesterol efflux and ( 2 ) repair of damaged proteins , very different to the general " fix the car " scenario AiG discuss .
These functions are more akin to the sentence " fill the car with fuel and if the car has a flat tyre , fix it " .
Does this sentence really have less information than " fix the porsche " ?
We will address this next , but it is obvious that AiG 's conclusion is invalid because of these two fundamental problems .
With this more appropriate analogy we can now approach the question of whether Apo - AIM has more or less information than Apo - AI .
We will use a formal approach to information theory called algorithmic information theory which is appropriate for comparing systems with multiple functions and will illustrate the case more clearly .
We can formally represent an enzymic function as a computer program which performs a given set of functions .
In algorithmic information theory , program size is directly proportional to information content , provided that the programs are written in the same language and written equally efficiently .
An enzyme with multiple functions must have a longer program to code for its functions , relative to an enzyme which performs a smaller subset of these functions .
Hence , an enzyme performing both functions A and B must necessarily have more information than an enzyme which performs only function A or only function B .
We can represent our more reasonable analogy in algorithmic information theory by envisaging wild - type Apo - AI as a robot which has been programmed with the task of filling a car with fuel ( in the spirit of AiG 's car analogy , as activation of ACAT fills HDLs with cholesterol ) .
To do this task , a program is required to be a certain number of bits long .
Now Apo -AIM would be like a robot that has been programmed to fill cars with fuel and recognise and replace flat tyres ( an analogy for the anti-oxidant " repair " activity ) .
It is clear this program must be longer than the program that simply fill the cars with fuel .
Therefore , according to algorithmic information theory , the longer program has more bits of information .
More technical information can be found on this page on algorithmic information theory , and this page has a critique of Werner Gitt 's ideas .
Once again we refer readers to this page on Spetner 's formulation of information for specific critiques of Spetner 's ideas .
It is important to note that Werner Gitt 's information theory formulations and Lee Spetner 's applications of information theory have not been published in scientific journals and are not peer - reviewed .
Currently , they are simply pseudo - scientific concepts , completely unused by professional research scientists .
More importantly , however , even using these formulations we can see that Apo - AIM has more AiG - style " information . "
Are homozygous Apo - AIM mutations lethal ?
In addition , AiG claims that since only heterozygotes of the Apo - AIM mutation have been identified so far ,
" This may suggest that the homozygote ( both genes the same ) A - I Milano mutation is lethal . "
Contrary to AiG 's claim , this finding is unsurprising given the present rarity of the Milano mutation .
The early work studying the heterozygous carriers of this mutant allele identified only 33 individuals , after genetic testing of all inhabitants in an isolated northern Italian village ( about 1000 people , 15 ) .
In the gene pool of this village , where the mutant allele originated and which has an extremely high concentration of Apo - AIM mutants relative to other human populations , the Milano allele has a frequency of only 1.65 % ( 33 mutant alleles out of 2000 total alleles of this gene ) .
Assuming that those individuals are mating randomly , it would be somewhat surprising to find a homozygous individual in a population of 1000 since we expect to find a homozygote at a frequency of about 1/3700 ( the chance of a homozygote is equivalent to 0.0165 squared ) .
However , all 33 of these individuals are known to be descendents of one original 18th century couple carrying the Milano mutation .
Humans mate with relatives much less than random , and therefore finding a homozygote in this population of carriers is highly improbable .
Thus , based upon our current knowledge of the allelic distribution , there is no reason to suspect that homozygous Milano mutations are lethal [ see Note ] .
Furthermore , transgenic mice have been made that are homozygous for the human Apo - AI Milano gene , and they are healthy ( 16 ) .
In fact , the results indicate that there is a dose responsive benefit for the allele - one mutant allele is better than none , but two are best .
The physiology and biochemistry of these transgenic mice ( both homo - and heterozygotes ) are extremely similar to that found in humans .
These facts prompted the authors to conclude that the transgenic Apo - AIM mice are an excellent experimental model system for studying the effects of this beneficial mutation .
The Apo -AIM mutation and lifestyle
AiG further suggests that even if the Apo - AIM mutation is benefical , changes in lifestyle to reduce the risk of heart disease will render the Apo - AIM mutation pointless .
" Needless to say , if someone follows a healthy lifestyle , eats the right things ( something like the food pyramid as recently revised by Harvard Medical School , although this could be improved further ) , exercises , maintains a healthy weight and does not abuse their body by smoking , the A - I Milano mutation will likely be of no use .
Epidemiological studies show that heart disease can probably be avoided . "
While it is indeed true that life style changes can reduce heart disease , the original Apo - AIM population was found in Italy .
This is the the country that typifies the heart - healthy Mediterranean diet , a diet recommended to lower heart disease ( 17 ) .
Italy has less than half the heart disease found in places like North America .
Furthermore , the Apo - AIM bearing population is in a community that has even lower than average rates of heart disease for Italy itself ( 1 , 15 ) .
Thus the Apo - AIM mutation is still beneficial even in healthy populations with low risk factors for cardiovascular disease .
Conclusions :
AiG claims that the Apo - AIM mutation , which produces a reduction in risk from heart attack and stroke , results in a loss of specificity .
However , these claims are incorrect .
Instead , Apo - AIM is 1 ) of a more complex tertiary structure 2 ) more stable and 3 ) activates cholesterol efflux more effectively than Apo - AI .
Furthermore , Apo -AIM has an antioxidant activity not present in Apo - AI that is sequence and substrate specific .
Thus , far from a loss of specificity , Apo - AIM represents a gain of specificity and " information " by AiG 's own measures .
Contrary to AiG 's suggestion , all current evidence indicates that the Apo - AIM mutation is beneficial for its carriers , whether heterozygous or homozygous .

The Inequality Taboo
by Charles Murray
When the late Richard Herrnstein and I published The Bell Curve eleven years ago , the furor over its discussion of ethnic differences in IQ was so intense that most people who have not read the book still think it was about race .
Since then , I have deliberately not published anything about group differences in IQ , mostly to give the real topic of The Bell Curve — the role of intelligence in reshaping America ’s class structure — a chance to surface .
The Lawrence Summers affair last January made me rethink my silence .
The president of Harvard University offered a few mild , speculative , off - the - record remarks about innate differences between men and women in their aptitude for high - level science and mathematics , and was treated by Harvard ’s faculty as if he were a crank .
The typical news story portrayed the idea of innate sex differences as a renegade position that reputable scholars rejected .
It was depressingly familiar .
In the autumn of 1994 , I had watched with dismay as The Bell Curve ’s scientifically unremarkable statements about black IQ were successfully labeled as racist pseudoscience .
At the opening of 2005 , I watched as some scientifically unremarkable statements about male - female differences were successfully labeled as sexist pseudoscience .
The Orwellian disinformation about innate group differences is not wholly the media ’s fault .
Many academics who are familiar with the state of knowledge are afraid to go on the record .
Talking publicly can dry up research funding for senior professors and can cost assistant professors their jobs .
But while the public ’s misconception is understandable , it is also getting in the way of clear thinking about American social policy .
Good social policy can be based on premises that have nothing to do with scientific truth .
The premise that is supposed to undergird all of our social policy , the founders ’ assertion of an unalienable right to liberty , is not a falsifiable hypothesis .
But specific policies based on premises that conflict with scientific truths about human beings tend not to work .
Often they do harm .
One such premise is that the distribution of innate abilities and propensities is the same across different groups .
The statistical tests for uncovering job discrimination assume that men are not innately different from women , blacks from whites , older people from younger people , homosexuals from heterosexuals , Latinos from Anglos , in ways that can legitimately affect employment decisions .
Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 assumes that women are no different from men in their attraction to sports .
Affirmative action in all its forms assumes there are no innate differences between any of the groups it seeks to help and everyone else .
The assumption of no innate differences among groups suffuses American social policy .
That assumption is wrong .
When the outcomes that these policies are supposed to produce fail to occur , with one group falling short , the fault for the discrepancy has been assigned to society .
It continues to be assumed that better programs , better regulations , or the right court decisions can make the differences go away .
That assumption is also wrong .
Hence this essay .
Most of the following discussion describes reasons for believing that some group differences are intractable .
I shift from “ innate ” to “ intractable ” to acknowledge how complex is the interaction of genes , their expression in behavior , and the environment .
“ Intractable ” means that , whatever the precise partitioning of causation may be ( we seldom know ) , policy interventions can only tweak the difference at the margins .
I will focus on two sorts of differences : between men and women and between blacks and whites .
Here are three crucial points to keep in mind as we go along :
1 . The differences I discuss involve means and distributions .
In all cases , the variation within groups is greater than the variation between groups .
On psychological and cognitive dimensions , some members of both sexes and all races fall everywhere along the range .
One implication of this is that genius does not come in one color or sex , and neither does any other human ability .
Another is that a few minutes of conversation with individuals you meet will tell you much more about them than their group membership does .
2. Covering both sex differences and race differences in a single , non-technical article , I had to leave out much in the print edition of this article .
This online version is fully annotated and includes extensive supplementary material .
3 . The concepts of “ inferiority ” and “ superiority ” are inappropriate to group comparisons .
On most specific human attributes , it is possible to specify a continuum running from “ low ” to “ high , ” but the results cannot be combined into a score running from “ bad ” to “ good . ”
What is the best score on a continuum measuring aggressiveness ?
What is the relative importance of verbal skills versus , say , compassion ?
Of spatial skills versus industriousness ?
The aggregate excellences and shortcomings of human groups do not lend themselves to simple comparisons .
That is why the members of just about every group can so easily conclude that they are God ’s chosen people .
All of us use the weighting system that favors our group ’s strengths . ( 1 )
II
The technical literature documenting sex differences and their biological basis grew surreptitiously during feminism ’s heyday in the 1970 ’s and 1980’s .
By the 1990 ’s , it had become so extensive that the bibliography in David Geary ’s pioneering Male , Female ( 1998 ) ran to 53 pages .
( 2 ) Currently , the best short account of the state of knowledge is Steven Pinker ’s chapter on gender in The Blank Slate ( 2002 ) . ( 3 )
Rather than present a telegraphic list of all the differences that I think have been established , I will focus on the narrower question at the heart of the Summers controversy : as groups , do men and women differ innately in characteristics that produce achievement at the highest levels of accomplishment ?
I will limit my comments to the arts and sciences .
Since we live in an age when students are likely to hear more about Marie Curie than about Albert Einstein , it is worth beginning with a statement of historical fact : women have played a proportionally tiny part in the history of the arts and sciences .
( 4 ) Even in the 20th century , women got only 2 percent of the Nobel Prizes in the sciences — a proportion constant for both halves of the century — and 10 percent of the prizes in literature .
The Fields Medal , the most prestigious award in mathematics , has been given to 44 people since it originated in 1936 .
All have been men .
The historical reality of male dominance of the greatest achievements in science and the arts is not open to argument .
The question is whether the social and legal exclusion of women is a sufficient explanation for this situation , or whether sex - specific characteristics are also at work .
Mathematics offers an entry point for thinking about the answer .
Through high school , girls earn better grades in math than boys , but the boys usually do better on standardized tests .
( 5 ) The difference in means is modest , but the male advantage increases as the focus shifts from means to extremes .
In a large sample of mathematically gifted youths , for example , seven times as many males as females scored in the top percentile of the SAT mathematics test .
( 6 ) We do not have good test data on the male - female ratio at the top one - hundredth or top one - thousandth of a percentile , where first - rate mathematicians are most likely to be found , but collateral evidence suggests that the male advantage there continues to increase , perhaps exponentially . ( 7 )
Evolutionary biologists have some theories that feed into an explanation for the disparity .
In primitive societies , men did the hunting , which often took them far from home .
Males with the ability to recognize landscapes from different orientations and thereby find their way back had a survival advantage .
Men who could process trajectories in three dimensions — the trajectory , say , of a spear thrown at an edible mammal — also had a survival advantage .
( 8 ) Women did the gathering .
Those who could distinguish among complex arrays of vegetation , remembering which were the poisonous plants and which the nourishing ones , also had a survival advantage .
Thus the logic for explaining why men should have developed elevated three - dimensional visuospatial skills and women an elevated ability to remember objects and their relative locations — differences that show up in specialized tests today . ( 9 )
Perhaps this is a just - so story .
( 10 ) Why not instead attribute the results of these tests to socialization ?
Enter the neuroscientists .
It has been known for years that , even after adjusting for body size , men have larger brains than women .
Yet most psychometricians conclude that men and women have the same mean IQ ( although debate on this issue is growing ) .
( 11 )
One hypothesis for explaining this paradox is that three - dimensional processing absorbs the extra male capacity .
In the last few years , magnetic - resonance imaging has refined the evidence for this hypothesis , revealing that parts of the brain ’s parietal cortex associated with space perception are proportionally bigger in men than in women . ( 12 )
What does space perception have to do with scores on math tests ?
( 13 ) Enter the psychometricians , who demonstrate that when visuospatial ability is taken into account , the sex difference in SAT math scores shrinks substantially . ( 14 )
Why should the difference be so much greater at the extremes than at the mean ?
Part of the answer is that men consistently exhibit higher variance than women on all sorts of characteristics , including visuospatial abilities , meaning that there are proportionally more men than women at both ends of the bell curve .
( 15 ) Another part of the answer is that someone with a high verbal IQ can easily master the basic algebra , geometry , and calculus that make up most of the items in an ordinary math test .
Elevated visuospatial skills are most useful for the most difficult items .
( 16 )
If males have an advantage in answering those comparatively few really hard items , the increasing disparity at the extremes becomes explicable .
Seen from one perspective , this pattern demonstrates what should be obvious : there is nothing inherent in being a woman that precludes high math ability .
But there remains a distributional difference in male and female characteristics that leads to a larger number of men with high visuospatial skills .
The difference has an evolutionary rationale , a physiological basis , and a direct correlation with math scores .
Now put all this alongside the historical data on accomplishment in the arts and sciences .
In test scores , the male advantage is most pronounced in the most abstract items .
Historically , too , it is most pronounced in the most abstract domains of accomplishment . ( 17 )
In the humanities , the most abstract field is philosophy — and no woman has been a significant original thinker in any of the world ’s great philosophical traditions .
In the sciences , the most abstract field is mathematics , where the number of great women mathematicians is approximately two ( Emmy Noether definitely , Sonya Kovalevskaya maybe ) .
In the other hard sciences , the contributions of great women scientists have usually been empirical rather than theoretical , with leading cases in point being Henrietta Leavitt , Dorothy Hodgkin , Lise Meitner , Irene Joliot - Curie , and Marie Curie herself .
In the arts , literature is the least abstract and by far the most rooted in human interaction ; visual art incorporates a greater admixture of the abstract ; musical composition is the most abstract of all the arts , using neither words nor images .
The role of women has varied accordingly .
Women have been represented among great writers virtually from the beginning of literature , in East Asia and South Asia as well as in the West .
Women have produced a smaller number of important visual artists , and none that is clearly in the first rank .
No female composer is even close to the first rank .
Social restrictions undoubtedly damped down women ’s contributions in all of the arts , but the pattern of accomplishment that did break through is strikingly consistent with what we know about the respective strengths of male and female cognitive repertoires .
Women have their own cognitive advantages over men , many of them involving verbal fluency and interpersonal skills .
If this were a comprehensive survey , detailing those advantages would take up as much space as I have devoted to a particular male advantage .
But , sticking with my restricted topic , I will move to another aspect of male - female differences that bears on accomplishment at the highest levels of the arts and sciences : motherhood .
Regarding women , men , and babies , the technical literature is as unambiguous as everyday experience would lead one to suppose .
As a rule , the experience of parenthood is more profoundly life - altering for women than for men .
Nor is there anything unique about humans in this regard .
Mammalian reproduction generally involves much higher levels of maternal than paternal investment in the raising of children .
( 18 ) Among humans , extensive empirical study has demonstrated that women are more attracted to children than are men , respond to them more intensely on an emotional level , and get more and different kinds of satisfactions from nurturing them .
Many of these behavioral differences have been linked with biochemical differences between men and women . ( 19 )
Thus , for reasons embedded in the biochemistry and neurophysiology of being female , many women with the cognitive skills for achievement at the highest level also have something else they want to do in life : have a baby .
In the arts and sciences , forty is the mean age at which peak accomplishment occurs , preceded by years of intense effort mastering the discipline in question .
( 20 ) These are precisely the years during which most women must bear children if they are to bear them at all .
Among women who have become mothers , the possibilities for high - level accomplishment in the arts and sciences shrink because , for innate reasons , the distractions of parenthood are greater .
To put it in a way that most readers with children will recognize , a father can go to work and forget about his children for the whole day .
Hardly any mother can do this , no matter how good her day - care arrangement or full - time nanny may be .
My point is not that women must choose between a career and children , but that accomplishment at the extremes commonly comes from a single - minded focus that leaves no room for anything but the task at hand .
( 21 ) We should not be surprised or dismayed to find that motherhood reduces the proportion of highly talented young women who are willing to make that tradeoff .
Some numbers can be put to this observation through a study of nearly 2,000 men and women who were identified as extraordinarily talented in math at age thirteen and were followed up 20 years later .
( 22 ) The women in the sample came of age in the 1970 ’s and early 1980 ’s , when women were actively socialized to resist gender stereotypes .
In many ways , these talented women did resist .
By their early thirties , both the men and women had become exceptional achievers , receiving advanced degrees in roughly equal proportions .
Only about 15 percent of the women were full - time housewives .
Among the women , those who did and those who did not have children were equally satisfied with their careers .
And yet .
The women with careers were four - and - a- half times more likely than men to say they preferred to work fewer than 40 hours per week .
The men placed greater importance on “ being successful in my line of work ” and “ inventing or creating something that will have an impact , ” while the women found greater value in “ having strong friendships , ” “ living close to parents and relatives , ” and “ having a meaningful spiritual life . ”
As the authors concluded , “ these men and women appear to have constructed satisfying and meaningful lives that took somewhat different forms . ”
( 23 )
The different forms , which directly influence the likelihood that men will dominate at the extreme levels of achievement , are consistent with a constellation of differences between men and women that have biological roots .
I have omitted perhaps the most obvious reason why men and women differ at the highest levels of accomplishment : men take more risks , are more competitive , and are more aggressive than women .
( 24 ) The word “ testosterone ” may come to mind , and appropriately .
Much technical literature documents the hormonal basis of personality differences that bear on sex differences in extreme and venturesome effort , and hence in extremes of accomplishment — and that bear as well on the male propensity to produce an overwhelming proportion of the world ’s crime and approximately 100 percent of its wars .
But this is just one more of the ways in which science is demonstrating that men and women are really and truly different , a fact so obvious that only intellectuals could ever have thought otherwise .
III
Turning to race , we must begin with the fraught question of whether it even exists , or whether it is instead a social construct .
The Harvard geneticist Richard Lewontin originated the idea of race as a social construct in 1972 , arguing that the genetic differences across races were so trivial that no scientist working exclusively with genetic data would sort people into blacks , whites , or Asians .
In his words , “ racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance . ” ( 25 )
Lewontin ’s position , which quickly became a tenet of political correctness , carried with it a potential means of being falsified .
If he was correct , then a statistical analysis of genetic markers would not produce clusters corresponding to common racial labels .
In the last few years , that test has become feasible , and now we know that Lewontin was wrong .
( 26 ) Several analyses have confirmed the genetic reality of group identities going under the label of race or ethnicity .
( 27 )
In the most recent , published this year , all but five of the 3,636 subjects fell into the cluster of genetic markers corresponding to their self - identified ethnic group .
( 28 ) When a statistical procedure , blind to physical characteristics and working exclusively with genetic information , classifies 99.9 percent of the individuals in a large sample in the same way they classify themselves , it is hard to argue that race is imaginary .
Homo sapiens actually falls into many more interesting groups than the bulky ones known as “ races . ” ( 29 )
As new findings appear almost weekly , it seems increasingly likely that we are just at the beginning of a process that will identify all sorts of genetic differences among groups , whether the groups being compared are Nigerian blacks and Kenyan blacks , lawyers and engineers , or Episcopalians and Baptists .
At the moment , the differences that are obviously genetic involve diseases ( Ashkenazi Jews and Tay - Sachs disease , black Africans and sickle - cell anemia , Swedes and hemochromatosis ) .
As time goes on , we may yet come to understand better why , say , Italians are more vivacious than Scots .
Out of all the interesting and intractable differences that may eventually be identified , one in particular remains a hot button like no other : the IQ difference between blacks and whites .
What is the present state of our knowledge about it ?
There is no technical dispute on some of the core issues .
In the aftermath of The Bell Curve , the American Psychological Association established a task force on intelligence whose report was published in early 1996 . ( 30 )
The task force reached the same conclusions as The Bell Curve on the size and meaningfulness of the black - white difference .
Historically , it has been about one standard deviation ( 31 ) in magnitude among subjects who have reached adolescence ; ( 32 ) cultural bias in IQ tests does not explain the difference ; and the tests are about equally predictive of educational , social , and economic outcomes for blacks and whites .
However controversial such assertions may still be in the eyes of the mainstream media , they are not controversial within the scientific community .
The most important change in the state of knowledge since the mid-1990 ’s lies in our increased understanding of what has happened to the size of the black - white difference over time .
Both the task force and The Bell Curve concluded that some narrowing had occurred since the early 1970’s .
With the advantage of an additional decade of data , we are now able to be more precise : ( 1 ) The black - white difference in scores on educational achievement tests has narrowed significantly .
( 2 ) The black - white convergence in scores on the most highly “ g- loaded ” tests — the tests that are the best measures of cognitive ability — has been smaller , and may be unchanged , since the first tests were administered 90 years ago .
With regard to the difference in educational achievement , the narrowing of scores on major tests occurred in the 1970 ’s and 80’s .
In the case of the SAT , the gaps in the verbal and math tests as of 1972 were 1.24 and 1.26 standard deviations respectively .
( 33 ) By 1991 , when the gaps were smallest ( they have risen slightly since then ) , those numbers had dropped by .37 and .35 standard deviations .
The National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) , which is not limited to college - bound students , is preferable to the SAT for estimating nationally representative trends , but the story it tells is similar . ( 34 ) Among students ages nine , thirteen , and seventeen , the black - white differences in math as of the first NAEP test in 1973 were 1.03 , 1.29 , and 1.24 standard deviations respectively .
For nine - year - olds , the difference hit its all - time low of .73 standard deviations in 2004 , a drop of .30 standard deviations .
But almost all of that convergence had been reached by 1986 , when the gap was .78 standard deviations .
For thirteen - year - olds , the gap dropped by .45 standard deviations , reaching its low in 1986 .
For seventeen - year - olds , the gap dropped by .52 standard deviations , reaching its low in 1990 .
In the reading test , the comparable gaps for ages nine , thirteen , and seventeen as of the first NAEP test in 1971 were 1.12 , 1.17 , and 1.25 standard deviations .
Those gaps had shrunk by .38 , .62 , and .68 standard deviations respectively at their lowest points in 1988 .
( 35 ) They have since remained effectively unchanged .
An analysis by Larry Hedges and Amy Nowell uses a third set of data , examining the trends for high - school seniors by comparing six large data bases from different time periods from 1965 to 1992 .
The black - white difference on a combined measure of math , vocabulary , and reading fell from 1.18 to .82 standard deviations in that time , a reduction of .36 standard deviations . ( 36 )
So black and white academic achievement converged significantly in the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s , typically by more than a third of a standard deviation , and since then has stayed about the same . ( 37 )
What about convergence in tests explicitly designed to measure IQ rather than academic achievement ?
( 38 ) The ambiguities in the data leave two defensible positions .
The first is that the IQ difference is about one standard deviation , effectively unchanged since the first black - white comparisons 90 years ago .
The second is that harbingers of a narrowing difference are starting to emerge .
I cannot settle the argument here , but I can convey some sense of the uncertainty .
The case for an unchanged black - white IQ difference is straightforward .
If you take all the black - white differences on IQ tests from the first ones in World War I up to the present , there is no statistically significant downward trend .
Of course the results vary , because tests vary in the precision with which they measure the general mental factor ( g ) and samples vary in their size and representativeness .
But results continue to center around a black - white difference of about 1.0 to 1.1 standard deviations through the most recent data . ( 39 )
The case for a reduction has two important recent results to work with .
The first is from the 1997 re-norming of the Armed Forces Qualification Test ( AFQT ) , which showed a black - white difference of .97 standard deviations .
( 40 ) Since the typical difference on paper - and - pencil IQ tests like the AFQT has been about 1.10 standard deviations , the 1997 results represent noticeable improvement .
( 41 ) The second positive result comes from the 2003 standardization sample for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ( WISC - IV ) , which showed a difference of .78 standard deviations , as against the 1.0 difference that has been typical for individually administered IQ tests . ( 42 )
One cannot draw strong conclusions from two data points .
Those who interpret them as part of an unchanging overall pattern can cite another recent result , from the 2001 standardization of the Woodcock - Johnson intelligence test .
In line with the conventional gap , it showed an overall black - white difference of 1.05 standard deviations and , for youths aged six to eighteen , a difference of .99 standard deviations . ( 43 )
There is more to be said on both sides of this issue , but nothing conclusive . ( 44 ) Until new data become available , you may take your choice .
If you are a pessimist , the gap has been unchanged at about one standard deviation .
If you are an optimist , the IQ gap has decreased by a few points , but it is still close to one standard deviation .
The clear and substantial convergence that occurred in academic tests has at best been but dimly reflected in IQ scores , and at worst not reflected at all .
Whether we are talking about academic achievement or about IQ , are the causes of the black - white difference environmental or genetic ?
Everyone agrees that environment plays a part .
The controversy is about whether biology is also involved .
It has been known for many years that the obvious environmental factors such as income , parental occupation , and schools explain only part of the absolute black - white difference and none of the relative difference .
Black and white students from affluent neighborhoods are separated by as large a proportional gap as are blacks and whites from poor neighborhoods .
( 45 ) Thus the most interesting recent studies of environmental causes have worked with cultural explanations instead of socioeconomic status . ( 46 )
One example is Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb : A Study of Academic Disengagement ( 2003 ) by the Berkeley anthropologist John Ogbu , who went to Shaker Heights , Ohio , to explore why black students in an affluent suburb should lag behind their white peers .
( 47 ) Another is Black Rednecks and White Liberals ( 2005 ) by Thomas Sowell , who makes the case that what we think of as the dysfunctional aspects of urban black culture are a legacy not of slavery but of Southern and rural white “ cracker ” culture .
( 48 ) Both Ogbu and Sowell describe ingrained parental behaviors and student attitudes that must impede black academic performance .
These cultural influences often cut across social classes .
From a theoretical standpoint , the cultural explanations offer fresh ways of looking at the black - white difference at a time when the standard socioeconomic explanations have reached a dead end .
From a practical standpoint , however , the cultural explanations point to a cause of the black - white difference that is as impervious to manipulation by social policy as causes rooted in biology .
If there is to be a rapid improvement , some form of mass movement with powerful behavioral consequences would have to occur within the black community .
Absent that , the best we can hope for is gradual cultural change that is likely to be measured in decades .
This brings us to the state of knowledge about genetic explanations .
“ There is not much direct evidence on this point , ” said the American Psychological Association ’s task force dismissively , “ but what little there is fails to support the genetic hypothesis . ” ( 49 ) Actually , there is no direct evidence at all , just a wide variety of indirect evidence , almost all of which the task force chose to ignore . ( 50 )
As it happens , a comprehensive survey of that evidence , and of the objections to it , appeared this past June in the journal Psychology , Public Policy , and Law .
There , J. Philippe Rushton and Arthur Jensen co-authored a 60 - page article entitled “ Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability . ” ( 51 )
It incorporates studies of East Asians as well as blacks and whites and concludes that the source of the black - white - Asian difference is 50 - to 80 - percent genetic .
The same issue of the journal includes four commentaries , three of them written by prominent scholars who oppose the idea that any part of the black - white difference is genetic .
( 52 ) Thus , in one place , you can examine the strongest arguments that each side in the debate can bring to bear .
Rushton and Jensen base their conclusion on ten categories of evidence that are consistent with a model in which both environment and genes cause the black - white difference and inconsistent with a model that requires no genetic contribution . ( 53 ) I will not try to review their argument here , or the critiques of it .
All of the contributions can be found on the Internet , and can be understood by readers with a grasp of basic statistical concepts . ( 54 )
For those who consider it important to know what percentage of the IQ difference is genetic , a methodology that would do the job is now available .
In the United States , few people classified as black are actually of 100 - percent African descent ( the average American black is thought to be about 20 - percent white ) .
( 55 )
To the extent that genes play a role , IQ will vary by racial admixture .
In the past , studies that have attempted to test this hypothesis have had no accurate way to measure the degree of admixture , and the results have been accordingly muddy .
( 56 ) The recent advances in using genetic markers solves that problem .
Take a large sample of racially diverse people , give them a good IQ test , and then use genetic markers to create a variable that no longer classifies people as “ white ” or “ black , ” but along a continuum .
Analyze the variation in IQ scores according to that continuum .
The results would be close to dispositive . ( 57 )
None of this is important for social policy , however , where the issue is not the source of the difference but its intractability .
Much of the evidence reviewed by Rushton and Jensen bears on what we can expect about future changes in the black - white IQ difference .
My own thinking on this issue is shaped by the relationship of the difference to a factor I have already mentioned — “ g ” — and to the developing evidence for g’s biological basis .
When you compare black and white mean scores on a battery of subtests , you do not find a uniform set of differences ; nor do you find a random assortment .
The size of the difference varies systematically by type of subtest .
Asked to predict which subtests show the largest difference , most people will think first of ones that have the most cultural content and are the most sensitive to good schooling .
But this natural expectation is wrong .
Some of the largest differences are found on subtests that have little or no cultural content , such as ones based on abstract designs .
As long ago as 1927 , Charles Spearman , the pioneer psychometrician who discovered g , proposed a hypothesis to explain the pattern : the size of the black - white difference would be “ most marked in just those [ subtests ] which are known to be saturated with g. ” ( 58 )
In other words , Spearman conjectured that the black - white difference would be greatest on tests that were the purest measures of intelligence , as opposed to tests of knowledge or memory .
A concrete example illustrates how Spearman ’s hypothesis works .
Two items in the Wechsler and Stanford - Binet IQ tests are known as “ forward digit span ” and “ backward digit span . ”
In the forward version , the subject repeats a random sequence of one - digit numbers given by the examiner , starting with two digits and adding another with each iteration .
The subject ’s score is the number of digits that he can repeat without error on two consecutive trials .
Digits - backward works exactly the same way except that the digits must be repeated in the opposite order .
Digits - backward is much more g-loaded than digits - forward .
Try it yourself and you will see why .
Digits - forward is a straightforward matter of short - term memory .
Digits - backward makes your brain work much harder . ( 59 )
The black - white difference in digits - backward is about twice as large as the difference in digits - forward . ( 60 )
It is a clean example of an effect that resists cultural explanation .
It can not be explained by differential educational attainment , income , or any other socioeconomic factor .
Parenting style is irrelevant .
Reluctance to “ act white ” is irrelevant .
Motivation is irrelevant .
There is no way that any of these variables could systematically encourage black performance in digits - forward while depressing it in digits - backward in the same test at the same time with the same examiner in the same setting . ( 61 )
In 1980 , Arthur Jensen began a research program for testing Spearman ’s hypothesis .
In his book The g Factor ( 1998 ) , he summarized the results from seventeen independent sets of data , derived from 149 psychometric tests .
They consistently supported Spearman ’s hypothesis . ( 62 ) Subsequent work has added still more evidence .
( 63 ) Debate continues about what the correlation between g-loadings and the size of the black - white difference means , but the core of Spearman ’s original conjecture , that a sizable correlation would be found to exist , has been confirmed . ( 64 )
During the same years that Jensen was investigating Spearman ’s hypothesis , progress was also being made in understanding g.
For decades , psychometricians had tried to make g go away .
Confident that intelligence must be more complicated than a single factor , they strove to replace g with measures of uncorrelated mental skills .
They thereby made valuable contributions to our understanding of intelligence , which really does manifest itself in different ways and with different profiles , but getting rid of g proved impossible .
No matter how the data were analyzed , a single factor kept dominating the results . ( 65 )
By the 1980 ’s , the robustness and value of g as an explanatory construct were broadly accepted among pyschometricians , but little was known about its physiological basis . ( 66 ) As of 2005 , we know much more .
It is now established that g is by far the most heritable component of IQ . ( 67 ) A variety of studies have found correlations between g and physiological phenomena such as brain - evoked potentials , brain pH levels , brain glucose metabolism , nerve - conduction velocity , and reaction time . ( 68 ) Most recently , it has been determined that a highly significant relationship exists between g and the volume of gray matter in specific areas of the frontal cortex , and that the magnitude of the volume is under tight genetic control . ( 69 ) In short , we now know that g captures something in the biology of the brain .
So Spearman ’s basic conjecture was correct — the size of the black - white difference and g- loadings are correlated — and g represents a biologically grounded and highly heritable cognitive resource .
When those two observations are put together , a number of characteristics of the black - white difference become predictable , correspond with phenomena we have observed in data , and give us reason to think that not much will change in the years to come . ( 70 )
One implication is that black - white convergence on test scores will be greatest on tests that are least g-loaded .
Literacy is the obvious example : people with a wide range of IQ ’s can be taught to read competently , and it is the reading test of the NAEP in which convergence has reached its closest point ( .55 standard deviations in the 1988 test ) .
More broadly , the confirmation of Spearman ’s hypothesis explains why the convergence that has occurred on academic achievement tests has not been matched on IQ tests .
A related implication is that the source of the black - white difference lies in skills that are hardest to change .
Being able to repeat many digits backward has no value in itself .
It points to a valuable underlying mental ability , in the same way that percentage of fast - twitch muscle fibers points to an underlying athletic ability .
If you were to practice reciting digits backward for a few days , you could increase your score somewhat , just as training can improve your running speed somewhat .
But in neither case will you have improved the underlying ability .
( 71 ) As far as anyone knows , g itself can not be coached .
The third implication is that the “ Flynn effect ” will not close the black - white difference .
I am referring here to the secular increase in IQ scores over time , brought to public attention by James Flynn . ( 72 ) The Flynn effect has been taken as a reason for thinking that the black - white difference is temporary : if IQ scores are so malleable that they can rise steadily for several decades , why should not the black - white difference be malleable as well ? ( 73 )
But as the Flynn effect has been studied over the last decade , the evidence has grown , and now seems persuasive , that the increases in IQ scores do not represent significant increases in g . ( 74 )
What the increases do represent — whether increases in specific mental skills or merely increased test sophistication — is still being debated .
But if the black - white difference is concentrated in g and if the Flynn effect does not consist of increases in g , the Flynn effect will not do much to close the gap .
A 2004 study by Dutch scholars tested this question directly .
Examining five large databases , the authors concluded that “ the nature of the Flynn effect is qualitatively different from the nature of black - white differences in the United States , ” and that “ the implications of the Flynn effect for black - white differences appear small . ” ( 75 )
These observations represent my reading of a body of evidence that is incomplete , and they will surely have to be modified as we learn more .
But taking the story of the black - white IQ difference as a whole , I submit that we know two facts beyond much doubt .
First , the conventional environmental explanation of the black - white difference is inadequate .
Poverty , bad schools , and racism , which seem such obvious culprits , do not explain it .
Insofar as the environment is the cause , it is not the sort of environment we know how to change , and we have tried every practical remedy that anyone has been able to think of .
Second , regardless of one ’s reading of the competing arguments , we are left with an IQ difference that has , at best , narrowed by only a few points over the last century .
I can find nothing in the history of this difference , or in what we have learned about its causes over the last ten years , to suggest that any faster change is in our future .
IV
Elites throughout the West are living a lie , basing the futures of their societies on the assumption that all groups of people are equal in all respects .
Lie is a strong word , but justified .
It is a lie because so many elite politicians who profess to believe it in public do not believe it in private .
It is a lie because so many elite scholars choose to ignore what is already known and choose not to inquire into what they suspect .
We enable ourselves to continue to live the lie by establishing a taboo against discussion of group differences .
The taboo is not perfect — otherwise , I would not have been able to document this essay — but it is powerful .
Witness how few of Harvard ’s faculty who understood the state of knowledge about sex differences were willing to speak out during the Summers affair .
In the public - policy debate , witness the contorted ways in which even the opponents of policies like affirmative action frame their arguments so that no one can accuse them of saying that women are different from men or blacks from whites .
Witness the unwillingness of the mainstream media to discuss group differences without assuring readers that the differences will disappear when the world becomes a better place .
The taboo arises from an admirable idealism about human equality .
If it did no harm , or if the harm it did were minor , there would be no need to write about it .
But taboos have consequences .
The nature of many of the consequences must be a matter of conjecture because people are so fearful of exploring them .
( 76 ) Consider an observation furtively voiced by many who interact with civil servants : that government is riddled with people who have been promoted to their level of incompetence because of pressure to have a staff with the correct sex and ethnicity in the correct proportions and positions .
Are these just anecdotes ?
Or should we be worrying about the effects of affirmative action on the quality of government services ?
( 77 )
It would be helpful to know the answers , but we will not so long as the taboo against talking about group difference prevails .
How much damage has the taboo done to the education of children ?
Christina Hoff Sommers has argued that willed blindness to the different developmental patterns of boys and girls has led many educators to see boys as aberrational and girls as the norm , with pervasive damage to the way our elementary and secondary schools are run . ( 78 ) Is she right ?
Few have been willing to pursue the issue lest they be required to talk about innate group differences .
Similar questions can be asked about the damage done to medical care , whose practitioners have only recently begun to acknowledge the ways in which ethnic groups respond differently to certain drugs . ( 79 )
How much damage has the taboo done to our understanding of America ’s social problems ?
The part played by sexism in creating the ratio of males to females on mathematics faculties is not the ratio we observe but what remains after adjustment for male - female differences in high - end mathematical ability .
The part played by racism in creating different outcomes in black and white poverty , crime , and illegitimacy is not the raw disparity we observe but what remains after controlling for group characteristics .
For some outcomes , sex or race differences nearly disappear after a proper analysis is done .
For others , a large residual difference remains .
( 80 ) In either case , open discussion of group differences would give us a better grasp on where to look for causes and solutions .
What good can come of raising this divisive topic ?
The honest answer is that no one knows for sure .
What we do know is that the taboo has crippled our ability to explore almost any topic that involves the different ways in which groups of people respond to the world around them — which means almost every political , social , or economic topic of any complexity .
Thus my modest recommendation , requiring no change in laws or regulations , just a little more gumption .
Let us start talking about group differences openly — all sorts of group differences , from the visuospatial skills of men and women to the vivaciousness of Italians and Scots .
Let us talk about the nature of the manly versus the womanly virtues .
About differences between Russians and Chinese that might affect their adoption of capitalism .
About differences between Arabs and Europeans that might affect the assimilation of Arab immigrants into European democracies .
About differences between the poor and non-poor that could inform policy for reducing poverty .
Even to begin listing the topics that could be enriched by an inquiry into the nature of group differences is to reveal how stifled today ’s conversation is .
Besides liberating that conversation , an open and undefensive discussion would puncture the irrational fear of the male - female and black - white differences I have surveyed here .
We would be free to talk about other sexual and racial differences as well , many of which favor women and blacks , and none of which is large enough to frighten anyone who looks at them dispassionately .
Talking about group differences does not require any of us to change our politics .
For every implication that the Right might seize upon ( affirmative - action quotas are ill - conceived ) , another gives fodder to the Left ( innate group differences help rationalize compensatory redistribution by the state ) .
( 81 )
But if we do not need to change our politics , talking about group differences obligates all of us to renew our commitment to the ideal of equality that Thomas Jefferson had in mind when he wrote as a self - evident truth that all men are created equal .
Steven Pinker put that ideal in today ’s language in The Blank Slate , writing that “ Equality is not the empirical claim that all groups of humans are interchangeable ; it is the moral principle that individuals should not be judged or constrained by the average properties of their group . ” ( 82 )
Nothing in this essay implies that this moral principle has already been realized or that we are powerless to make progress .
In elementary and secondary education , many outcomes are tractable even if group differences in ability remain unchanged .
Dropout rates , literacy , and numeracy are all tractable .
School discipline , teacher performance , and the quality of the curriculum are tractable .
Academic performance within a given IQ range is tractable .
The existence of group differences need not and should not discourage attempts to improve schooling for millions of American children who are now getting bad educations .
In university education and in the world of work , overall openness of opportunity has been transformed for the better over the last half - century .
But the policies we now have in place are impeding , not facilitating , further progress .
Creating double standards for physically demanding jobs so that women can qualify ensures that men in those jobs will never see women as their equals .
In universities , affirmative action ensures that the black - white difference in IQ in the population at large is brought onto the campus and made visible to every student .
The intentions of their designers notwithstanding , today ’s policies are perfectly fashioned to create separation , condescension , and resentment — and so they have done .
The world need not be that way .
Any university or employer that genuinely applied a single set of standards for hiring , firing , admitting , and promoting would find that performance across different groups really is distributed indistinguishably .
But getting to that point nationwide will require us to jettison an apparatus of laws , regulations , and bureaucracies that has been 40 years in the making .
That will not happen until the conversation has opened up .
So let us take one step at a time .
Let us stop being afraid of data that tell us a story we do not want to hear , stop the name - calling , stop the denial , and start facing reality .

Their appearance on this list does not imply their endorsement of anything in the essay .
1 . If you think this is mushy nonjudgmentalism , try a thought experiment : Suppose that a pill exists that , if all women took it , would give them exactly the same mean and variance on every dimension of human functioning as men— including all the ways in which women now surpass men .
How many women would want all women to take it ?
Or suppose that the pill , taken by all blacks , would give them exactly the same mean and variance on every dimension of human functioning as whites — including all the ways in which blacks now surpass whites .
How many blacks would want all blacks to take it ?
To ask such questions is to answer them : hardly anybody .
Few want to trade off the unique virtues of their own group for the advantages that another group may enjoy .
Sometimes these preferences for one ’s own group are rational , sometimes not .
I am proud of being Scots - Irish , for example , even though the Scots - Irish group means for violence , drunkenness , and general disagreeableness seem to have been far above those of other immigrant groups .
But the Scots - Irish made great pioneers — that ’s the part of my heritage that I choose to value .
A
Thai friend gave me an insight into this human characteristic many years ago when I remarked that Thais were completely undefensive about Westerners despite the economic backwardness of Thailand in those days .
My friend explained why .
America has wealth and technology that Thailand does not have , he acknowledged , just as the elephant is stronger than a human .
“ But , ” he said with a shrug , “ who wants to be an elephant ? ”
None of us wants to be an elephant and , from the perspective of our own group , every other group has something of the elephant about it .
All of us are right , too .

Julian Stanley , who has been associated with Talent Search for many years , is said to have asserted in an interview that the male : female ratio among such students has dropped to about 3 to 1 .
I have not been able to locate the interview or any data substantiating that ratio .
In any case , here is a reminder : currently , the 800 top score in the SAT - Math is only about 2.6 standard deviations above the mean — that is , it includes about one in 200 test - takers .
This is nowhere close to the extreme right end of the bell curve from which top mathematicians are drawn .

A continuing problem for evolutionary biology is the accusation that its scholars observe human characteristics today and work backward into a rationale that fits .
But a sex difference in visuospatial abilities is found in many other animals besides humans , always favoring males — which gives good reason for thinking that in this case we are observing something more than a just - so story .
See Jones , Braithwaite , and Healy ( 2003 ) .
11 . For a review of the evidence that male and female IQ is the same , see Jensen ( 1998 ) : 536–42 .
The underlying problem is that the subtests in IQ tests have been developed and normed in ways that tend to push male and female IQs toward the same mean IQ ( for example , items that show a large sex difference are usually discarded ) .
For the evidence that men have a higher mean IQ than women , see Ankney ( 1992 ) , Lynn ( 1999 ) , Lynn and Irwing ( 2004 ) , and Nyborg ( in press ) .
12 . See Goldstein , Seidman , Horton et al. ( 2001 ) and the interpretation of those findings in Cahill ( 2005 ) .
This is far from a settled issue .
Research into the neurophysiology of sex differences is exploring a variety of trails .
For example , Gron , Spitzer , Tomczak et al. ( 2000 ) discovered that men and women activate different parts of the brain when they are working out navigation tasks , and do so in patterns consistent with the proposition that navigation is cognitively more difficult for women .
Consistent evidence also links the size of brain regions with level of capability ( Cahill 2005 ) .
This relationship between specific parts of the brain and capability holds at an aggregate level as well : IQ is correlated with brain size ( adjusted for body size ) .
The relationship of brain size to IQ has often been derided ( e.g. , Gould 1981 ) , and indeed brain size was a problematic measure when it had to be based on skull size or post - mortem data .
But magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies of brain size have ended the uncertainty about the existence of its relationship with IQ .
For meta- analyses of MRI and other in vivo studies , see Jensen ( 1998 ) : 147 , which puts the correlation between brain size and IQ at about .40 , and McDaniel ( 2005 ) , which puts it at about .33 .
13 . E.g. , Johnson ( 1984 ) , Casey , Nuttall , Pezaris et al. ( 1995 ) , and Geary , Saults , Liu et al. ( 2000 ) .
There has been dispute on this point .
Friedman ( 1995 ) argues that performance in math tests is more strongly related to verbal ability than to visuospatial abilities .
Royer , Tronsky , Chan et al. ( 1999 ) present evidence that the real source of the male advantage is faster retrieval of arithmetic facts from long - term memory .
A third line of argument has been that the apparent male advantage is actually mediated by IQ ( e.g. , Linn and Peterson 1985 ) .
Geary , Saults , Liu et al. ( 2000 ) controlled for IQ and found that both visuospatial abilities and the computational advantage found by Royer , Tronsky , Chan et al. ( 1999 ) were at work .

The self - identified ethnic groups consisted of non-Hispanic black , non-Hispanic white , East Asian , and Hispanic .
The statistical procedure was cluster analysis .
The algorithms in cluster analysis are not trying to find groupings that correspond to any pre-identified characteristic of the people in the sample — that is , the researchers did not use any information about the physical characteristics that humans use to identify ethnicity .
Cluster analysis simply looks for interrelationships among the genetic markers that identify statistically distinct entities .
29 . In Tang , Quertermous , Rodriguez et al. ( 2005 ) , “ Hispanic ” corresponded to a cluster , even though no one thinks of “ Hispanic ” as a race .
People do not need to belong to different races , conventionally defined , to be genetically distinct .

31 . The standard deviation is a statistic that ( simplified ) expresses the average difference of all the scores from the mean .
More precisely , the standard deviation is calculated by squaring the deviation from the mean for each score , summing all those squared deviations , finding the mean of that sum , then taking the square root of the result .
Given a normal distribution — a bell curve — someone who is one standard deviation above the mean is at the 84th percentile .
Two standard deviations above the mean put that person at the 98th percentile .
IQ tests are normed to have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 .
32 . The black - white difference emerges as early as IQ can be tested , but the gap is usually smaller in pre-adolescence .
Among pre-schoolers , the gap can be just a few IQ points .
Why does it increase with age ?
One obvious hypothesis is inferior schooling — e.g. , Fryer and Levitt ( 2004 ) .
But black children attending excellent schools also fall behind their white counterparts , as discussed subsequently in the text and in note 14 .
The alternative explanation is that the heritability of IQ increases with age for people of all races , and this is reflected in black IQ scores in adolescence and adulthood .

My analysis of its annual College - Bound Seniors report , distributed as printed material prior to 1996 and available online from 1996 onward .
A word about the method of calculating the difference .
When comparing scores from two groups , the preferred method is to divide the difference in the two scores by the pooled standard deviations of the two groups .
The equation is
where N is the sample size , X is the sample mean , s is the standard deviation , and the subscripts a and b denote each group .
When the black - white difference for a specific test is reported subsequently in the text , this equation has been used to compute it .

35 .
For nine - year - olds , the gap in reading scores expressed as points was smaller in 2004 ( 26 points ) than in 1988 ( 29 points ) , but the difference in standard deviations was fractionally larger ( .76 standard deviations in 2004 as compared with .74 in 1988 ) .

37 . I will venture a prediction that a variety of academic achievement measures in elementary and secondary school will soon show renewed convergence because of the No Child Left Behind Act , which puts schools under intense pressure to teach to the test in basic skills .
If students are drilled on limited ranges of subject matter , scores will tend to rise .
The more basic the tests are ( that is , the easier they are ) , the more that improvements among the least skilled will affect the mean .
Also , the higher the stakes facing a school — and the No Child Left Behind
Act makes those stakes very high indeed — the greater will be the incentives for administrators to use some of the many resources at their disposal to make the results come out right , through the judicious manipulation of suspensions and absences , and through outright cheating ( yes , it has been known to happen ) .
Some convergence in black and white test scores will probably occur , but partitioning that effect among the competing explanations is a task that will take a few years .
Insofar as the convergence has been the result of teaching to the test and of artifacts , it will be temporary .
38 .
In a given year , IQ tests and academic tests administered to the same sample will produce similar results .
Thus , it is possible to make a reasonably good guess about a person ’s IQ based on his SAT score compared to the distribution of SAT scores in a given year , and after taking the composition of the SAT population into account .
But the results of academic tests are sensitive to changes in academic achievement , whereas IQ tests are explicitly designed to measure a general mental factor , g , that is independent of academic achievement .
A notorious illustration of the way that academic test scores can drop is the period during the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s when SAT scores declined substantially , even after accounting for changes in the pool of test - takers ( Murray and Herrnstein 1992 ) .
The intelligence of American youth was not declining , just their academic achievement .
39 .
The significance of g- loadings is discussed later in the text .
In terms of interpreting trends over time , the problem is that tests are not equally good measures of g .
They go from poor ( e.g. , a basic reading test ) to excellent ( the most highly g- loaded , individually administered IQ test ) .
It is as if you were trying to measure changes in average height with measuring tapes of varying accuracy .

The .97 figure comes from my analysis of the proxy AFQT score in the most recent release of the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth ( NLSY ) .
I call it a proxy score because , eight years after the test battery was administered , the Armed Forces still has not gotten around to creating an official AFQT score .
The version created by the NLSY staff is a composite of the same subtests used for previous versions of the AFQT , and takes the subject ’s age into account .
The NLSY has released the percentile scores , which I converted to standard scores .
The analysis used the NLSY ’s sample weights to make the results representative of the national population .
The NLSY data can be downloaded online .
41 . I take the 1.10 figure from Roth , Bevier , Bobko et al. ( 2001 ) , a meta - analysis of the black - white difference in both achievement tests and IQ tests .
The Roth et al. results are necessarily reflective of pencil - and - paper tests , because that is where the overwhelming majority of published test data come from .
With rare exceptions , the data on individually administered IQ tests such as the Wechsler , Stanford - Binet , and Woodcock - Johnson are limited to their periodic standardization samples .
The number of such studies is small .
These results are overwhelmed in a meta - analysis by the many more studies based on pencil - and - paper tests .
The previous re-norming of the AFQT occurred in 1979 , when the AFQT was administered to the 1979 cohort of the NLSY .
Herrnstein and Murray ( 1994 ) put the black - white difference for that cohort at 1.21 standard deviations .
Compared with that figure , the improvement in the 1997 cohort ( a .97 black - white difference ) is .24 standard deviations .
But Neal ( in press ) has uncovered patterns in the answers of black members of the 1979 cohort that indicate the 1979 cohort produced an artificially low black mean .
First , some background :
Any test that tries to measure cognitive ability has to make assumptions about baseline skills .
If a person can read , even if not very well , then an IQ test can make use of written items ; if the subject is illiterate , it cannot .
Similarly , if a person knows numbers and the principles of basic arithmetic , even if not very well , then an IQ test can make use of numeric problems ; but if the subject is innumerate , it cannot .
Neal argues that the pattern of answers for the 1979 cohort indicates that “ a substantial fraction of the NLSY79 sample of black males who took the ASVAB test lacked the basic math and reading skills covered by the exam , lacked any motivation to put forth effort during the exam , or both , ” with a similar situation , not quite as bad , for black females ( Neal , in press : 13 ) Given the convergence in academic test scores during the 1980 ’s , it is likely that the proportion of the 1997 NLSY cohort so completely lacking in the basic skills was smaller than in the 1979 cohort .
If so , this change alone , not an increase in cognitive ability , would produce convergence in the black - white difference in the AFQT .
In addition , the administration of the ASVAB in 1997 was computer - adaptive .
Instead of being confronted with pages of questions ( 105 of them ) as in the traditional paper - and - pencil ASVAB ( the kind used in 1979 ) , subjects saw one question at time , and the difficulty of each subsequent question was adapted to the subject ’s previous answer — a method less likely to provoke the kind of give - up response that Neal found in the 1979 data .
Neal did not try to estimate the magnitude of the artifact in the 1979 data , but if a “ substantial fraction ” of the NLSY males had unrealistically low scores , some figure lower than 1.21 standard deviations would be appropriate as a baseline for comparing the 1997 AFQT results .
The overall black - white difference of 1.10 standard deviations as found in the meta - analysis is the natural choice .
42 . The black and white means on the WISC - IV ’s measure of full - scale IQ were 91.7 and 103.2 respectively ( Prifitera , Weiss , Saklofske et al. 2005 : 24 ) .
Standard deviations for computing the black - white difference were supplied by the Psychological Corporation , which produces the Wechsler tests .
43 .
The 1.05 and .99 figures come from my analysis of data for the 2001 standardization sample for the Woodcock - Johnson III ( WJ - III ) test of cognitive ability , provided courtesy of the Woodcock - Munoz Foundation .
The results from the WJ - III are noteworthy because the WJ - III provides the best known statistical estimate of g .
Uniquely among the major standardized tests , the scoring system for the WJ - III uses principal - components analysis to find the best weighted combination of subtests instead of treating all subtests equally ( Schrank , McGrew , and Woodcock 2001 ) .
44 . Two resourceful defenders of the environmental hypothesis about the black - white difference , James Flynn and William Dickens , are working on their own analysis of the black - white difference over time that should materially add to the state of knowledge when it is released .
Here are a few examples of the ambiguities that complicate the assessment of whether the IQ difference has changed , and that have prevented me from stating a confident conclusion :
Example 1 .
One of the few sources that has several data points over time with a consistent measure is the General Social Survey ( GSS ) available online , conducted annually by the National Opinion Research Center ; which in most years through the 2000 survey , it included a ten - item vocabulary test .
Example 2 . The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children ( K - ABC ) is a test that has consistently shown smaller black - white differences than other IQ tests .
There are a number of reasons for this , one being that subtests showing large black - white differences were excluded ( the K - ABC includes forward - digit span but not backward - digit span , for example ) .
See Jensen ( 1984 ) for a full discussion .
But though the black - white difference is smaller , it has not changed .
In the manual for the original standardization published in 1983 , the means on the “ Mental Processing Composite ” ( K - ABC ’s version of an IQ score ) for the white and black samples were 102.0 and 95.0 respectively ( A. S. Kaufman and Kaufman 1983 : 152 ) .
Twenty - one years later , those means were both within a point of their 1983 values — 102.7 and 94.8 respectively ( A.S. Kaufman and N.L. Kaufman 2004 : 96 ) .
Which is more meaningful ?
The smaller black - white difference shown by the K - ABC ?
Or the absence of any convergence over time ?
Example 3 .
In trying to discriminate between increases in IQ and improvements in academic achievement , one strategy is to explore which parts of the distribution of scores show the most change .
Convergence that occurs because of improvements at the bottom of the distribution is likely to reflect remediation of fundamental educational deficits , which could leave the IQ distribution more or less untouched .
In their analysis of six major cross-sectional databases spanning the period from 1965 to 1992 , Hedges and Nowell ( 1998 ) found that “ Racial disparities have diminished over time in the lower tail , but not in the upper tail ” ( 159 ) .
In the NAEP , they found that “ From 1980 to 1988 there was a substantial increase at all points on the black distribution , with much greater change in the lower percentiles ” for the reading scores , and a similar pattern for math scores ( 161 ) .
Another analysis , however , finds that almost all of the improvement in scores has occurred among black students in the upper half of the black distribution .
For example , the AFQT math score of a black male age 15 – 17 at the 70th percentile of the black distribution in 1980 was equivalent to the score of a white male at about the 28th percentile of the white distribution ( Neal , in press , Figure 2a ) .
In 1997 , a black male at the 70th percentile of the black distribution had risen to about the 40th percentile of the white distribution .
Neal finds a similar result for math scores in the NAEP in the period 1978 – 1992/96 ( Figures 2c and 2d ) .
In contrast , Neal has found almost no increases among students in the bottom half of the black distribution .
How can the results from two analyses be so different ?
The apparent contradiction — it is not a real contradiction — arises from the fact that almost all of the improvement of blacks in the upper half of the black distribution represents improvement in scores in the lower half of the national distribution of scores .
But return to the example of the AFQT : even in 1997 , a black subject with a score that put him at the 50th percentile of the white distribution — in other words , a little above the overall national mean — was at about the 80th percentile of the black distribution .
In 1980 , a black student had to be at about the 90th percentile of the black distribution to have a score above the national mean .
Which analysis should one use ?
That depends on the topic for which one wants information .
If the question is , “ Who improved their scores relative to whites , the students at the bottom of the black distribution or the students at the top of it ? , ” Neal ’s analysis provides the correct answer .
If the question is , “ Did most of the improvement in black scores occur at the bottom or the top of the national distribution of scores ? , ” then Hedges and Nowell ’s approach provides the correct answer .
In deciding whether IQ has risen , how does one balance these results ?
I am an optimist about the recent past .
To me , the various ambiguous indicators add up to the likelihood that a reduction in the IQ gap has occurred alongside the reduction in the academic - achievement gap .
Forced to make a bet , I would guess that the black - white difference in IQ has dropped by somewhere in the range of .10–.20 standard deviations over the last few decades .
I must admit , however , that I am influenced by a gut - level conviction that the radical improvement in the political , legal , and economic environment for blacks in the last half of the 20th century must have had an effect on IQ .
To conclude that no narrowing whatsoever has occurred raises the question , “ How can that be ? ”
One would have to argue that all of the gains in some aspects of the environment have been counterbalanced by new deficits in other aspects , and that those new deficits affect different socioeconomic classes similarly .
If the argument is restricted to environmental changes , I can not imagine how that case might be made .
Another possibility is that improvement in the environmental causes of IQ has been counterbalanced by what is known as “ dysgenic ” fertility .
For several decades at least , women with the highest IQs have been having the fewest babies , and black women have been no different from anyone else ( Herrnstein and Murray 1994 : chapter 15 ) .
But the problem is especially acute among blacks because it is not just black women above the national average IQ who are having the fewest babies but women above the black average .
Consider the results for the women of the 1979 NLSY cohort , whose childbearing years are effectively over ( they ranged in age from thirty - eight to forty - five when these numbers were collected ) .
Using a nationally representative subsample for the analysis , one finds that the mean AFQT score of the black women was 85.7 .
Sixty percent of the children born to this cohort were born to women with AFQT scores below that average .
Another 33 percent were born to women with scores from 85.7 to 100 .
Only 7 percent were born to women with IQs of 100 and over .
Did the children do better ?
A total of 716 of them were tested with a highly g- loaded verbal test , the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test ( revised ) .
The mean of the subset of mothers whose children were tested was 83.7 .
The mean of their children was 80.2 .
The mothers and children were tested with different instruments , so it should not be concluded that the black mean actually went down in the new generation .
But these data certainly give no reason to think it went up .
It is thus technically possible that black IQ could have remained about the same during the last half - century despite the revolutionary changes for the better in the status of black Americans .
Deciding whether that in fact happened requires more evidence than I have presented here .
When I try to forecast the future , I become a pessimist .
Here is how I read the overall patterns of change in the academic achievement tests versus the IQ tests :
In a world where Rushton and Jensen are right and the black - white difference is 50 - to 80 - percent genetic , academic performance and IQ will both improve as the environment improves , and for the same reason : environment plays a role in both measures .
Academic test scores will begin to rise before IQ does , because academic performance can improve immediately upon getting a better education whereas the environmental factors affecting IQ are more diffuse .
For a related reason — changes in the quality of education can cause substantial increases or drops in academic achievement , whereas IQ can not be changed much by any known discrete , time - limited environmental change — convergence will be greater in academic achievement than in IQ .
Since the environmental role is only 20 to 50 percent of the total , the improvements in both academic and IQ test scores will eventually level off as the limits of environmental change are reached .
To me , the pattern we have observed since good longitudinal data became available in the early 1970 ’s is consistent with these expectations .
The only surprise is that evidence for convergence in IQ scores has been so slow to emerge and so spotty .
I interpret the pattern as indicating that convergence is nearing an asymptote and that not much will change in the future .
45 . Blacks and whites have different distributions of socioeconomic status ( SES ) , and SES is correlated with IQ among both blacks and whites .
When the difference in black and white SES distributions is statistically controlled , studies have typically found that the black - white difference is reduced by about a third of a standard deviation .
But when blacks and whites of similar socioeconomic status are compared with each other , the difference as measured in standard deviations remains the same or increases as SES goes up .
For a review of the evidence on this point , see Herrnstein and Murray ( 1994 ) : 286–89 .
46 . I put aside here the explanation that has received the most publicity in recent years , the phenomenon labeled “ stereotype threat . ”
Its discoverers , Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson , demonstrated experimentally that test performance by academically talented blacks was worse when a test was called an IQ test than when it was innocuously described as a research tool ( Steele and Aronson 1995 ) .
Press reports erroneously interpreted this as meaning that stereotype threat explained away the black - white difference .
In reality , Steele and Aronson showed only that it increases the usual black - white difference ; if one eliminates stereotype threat , the usual difference remains .
The misrepresentation of these results in the mainstream media was grotesque .
For example , the narrator of the PBS television program Frontline told his viewers that “ blacks who believed the test was merely a research tool did the same as whites . ”
The Boston Globe reported that “ Black students who think a test is unimportant match their white counterparts ’ scores . ”
Newsweek reported that “ blacks who were told that the test was a laboratory problem - solving task that was not diagnostic of ability scored about the same as whites . ”
Such claims have now infiltrated major psychology texts .
The third edition of Psychology by Davis and Palladino ( 2002 ) reports that “ The results revealed that African - American students who thought they were simply solving problems performed as well as white students . ”
Similar statements have appeared in scientific journals .
All of the above examples are taken from Sackett , Hardison , and Cullen ( 2004 ) .
Sackett et al. also have a nice description of how the research results should have been described : “ In the sample studied , there are no differences between groups in prior SAT scores , as a result of the statistical adjustment .
Creating stereotype threat produces a difference in scores ; eliminating threat returns to the baseline condition of no difference ” ( 9 ) .
Readers may follow the latest in the debate by reading a set of responses to Sackett , Hardison , and Cullen ( 2004 ) in the April 2005 issue of American Psychologist , but nothing in the critiques overturns the above description .
The existence of stereotype threat has indeed been demonstrated .
It is an interesting phenomenon , and some claims have been made that reducing stereotype threat can improve scores on certain tests ( Good , Aronson , and Inzlicht 2003 ) , but the widespread assertion that stereotype threat explains a significant part of the observed black - white difference is wrong .
The dissemination of that false assertion is perhaps understandable in the case of journalists who are not supposed to be sophisticated about such topics .
It is less easily explained away when done by authors of technical articles and textbooks .

In truth , the closest thing to direct evidence involves brain size , which is known to have a correlation with IQ ( see note 12 ) and to be different for blacks , whites , and East Asians .
See J.P. Rushton and E.W. Rushton ( 2003 ) for a recent literature review of the evidence .
But the task force did not mention brain size .
There is also no mention of IQ in sub-Saharan Africa , the results of transracial adoption studies , the correlation of the black - white difference with the g- loadedness of tests , regression to racial means across the range of IQ , or other relevant data .
What the task force chose to define as “ direct evidence ” was a study of children of American black soldiers born to German women after World War II , and studies that use blood - group methods to estimate the degree of African ancestry in American blacks .
Both are discussed at length in Rushton and Jensen ( 2005a ) and Nisbett ( 2005 ) .
51 . Rushton and Jensen ( 2005a ) .
52 . The other articles are Sternberg ( 2005 ) , Nisbett ( 2005 ) , Suzuki and Aronson ( 2005 ) , Gottfredson ( 2005 b ) , and Rushton and Jensen ( 2005 b )
53 .
The ten categories , following Rushton and Jensen ’s wording , are as follow : ( 1 ) the world - wide evidence of a consistent black - white - Asian difference , ( 2 ) the greater black - white difference on g- loaded subtests than on culture - bound subtests , ( 3 ) the greater black - white difference on highly heritable subtests than on culturally malleable subtests , ( 4 ) the association of the black - white - Asian difference with differences in brain size , ( 5 ) the persistence of the black - white - Asian difference among trans - racial adoptees , ( 6 ) the consistency of the black - white difference with studies of racial admixture , ( 7 ) regression of black and white relatives ( offspring or siblings ) to their respective racial means , ( 8 ) consistency of the black - white - Asian IQ differences with differences in 60 other behavioral traits , ( 9 ) consistency of the black - white - Asian differences with evolutionary explanations , and ( 10 ) the inability to explain black - white - Asian differences with a zero- genetic model or even with a 50 - percent environmental model .
54 . Rushton has posted all of the articles at his website .
55 . Chakraborty , Kamboh , Nwankwo et al. ( 1992 ) , Parra , Marcini , Akey et al. ( 1998 ) .
56 . A variety of studies , summarized in Rushton and Jensen ( 2005a ) : 260 –61 , generally show that the IQs for mixed - race children are about midway between those of children with two white and two black parents .
On the other hand , studies that characterized racial composition based on blood group do not predict IQ ( Nisbett 2005 : 306–07 ) .
57 .
The results of such a study would be especially powerful if the study also characterized variables like skin color , making it possible to compare the results for subjects for whom genetic heritage and appearance are discrepant .
For example , suppose it were found that light - skinned blacks do better in IQ tests than dark - skinned blacks even when their degree of African genetic heritage is the same .
This would constitute convincing evidence that social constructions about race , not the genetics of race , influence the development of IQ .
Given a well - designed study , many such hypotheses about the conflation of social and biological effects could be examined .

The average adult gets a digits - backward score of 5 ( Jensen 1998 : 263 ) .
You may compare your own score with the highest I have observed , 13 and 12 , achieved respectively by José Zalaquett , former chairman of Amnesty International , and the political analyst Charles Krauthammer .
Zalaquett ’s score might have been higher if he had not been in a car weaving through traffic at 70 miles per hour on the New Jersey Turnpike .
Krauthammer ’s score might have been higher if he had n’t been driving .
60 . Jensen ( 1998 ) : 370 .
61 . A similarly clean example of a black - white difference is produced by reaction - time tests , in which two different measures are taken : the time it takes for the subject to respond to the lighted buttons that constitute the stimulus ( a g- loaded measure ) and the time it takes to move one ’s finger from the home button to the appropriate lighted button ( no g- loading ) .
Black subjects have faster movement times and slower response times — once again a contrast , consistent with Spearman ’s hypothesis , produced at the same time with the same examiner in the same setting .
None of the usual ways to explain away the black - white difference through cultural causes applies .
See Jensen ( 1998 ) : 389–93 .
62 . Jensen ( 1998 ) : 369–402 .
63 . Nyborg and Jensen ( 2000 ) .
It should also be noted that one test of Spearman ’s hypothesis has been conducted comparing East Asians and whites .
The better the measure of g , the greater the advantage of East Asians over whites .
See Nagoshi , Johnson , DeFries et al. ( 1984 ) .
64 . Jensen ’s evidence has been accompanied by a debate over his method of correlated vectors for testing Spearman ’s hypothesis .
P.H. Schönemann has argued , most extensively in Schönemann ( 1997 ) , that Jensen ’s evidence was no more than a statistical artifact , a claim refuted by Dolan and Lubke ( 2001 ) .
But other ways in which the method of correlated vectors might yield spurious results are still being debated ; e.g. , Dolan ( 2000 ) , Lubke , Dolan , and Kelderman ( 2001 ) , Dolan , Roorda , and Wicherts ( 2004 ) , Ashton and Lee ( in press ) .
These arguments are being carried on at an arcane methodological level .
I am making a limited claim about what Jensen has established beyond dispute : when you take a battery of mental tests , subject them to a factor analysis , and correlate the loadings on the first factor with the size of the black - white difference , the correlation will average about .6 .
The actual method of correlated vectors is more complicated than this , and is described in Jensen ( 1998 ) : 372–74 .
65 . Factor analysis can be conducted in many different ways , which has led to widespread popular acceptance of one of Stephen Jay Gould ’s allegations in his best - selling book , The Mismeasure of Man ( 1981 ) , namely , that g is a statistical artifact that appears only when certain analytic choices are made .
Actually , the opposite is true .
A single factor , typically explaining about three times as much variance as all the other factors combined , emerges under all of the normal methods of conducting a factor analysis .
The only exception occurs if the factor - analysis program is explicitly instructed to apportion the variance in such a way that a single factor does not emerge .
But if you do that and then try to publish your results , the reviewers will point out that if you had n’t issued that instruction , you would have gotten a dominant single factor .
As Richard Herrnstein liked to say , “ You can make g hide , but you ca n’t make it go away . ”

Let it be clear : I am not asserting that putting these two facts together proves that the black - white difference is genetic .
The logic of the situation was memorably converted to an analogy in Lewontin ( 1970 ) and adapted in Herrnstein & Murray ( 1994 ) : 298 .
If you take two handfuls of genetically identical seed corn and plant one in Iowa and the other in the Mohave Desert , you will get a large group difference in results despite the high heritability of the traits of corn .
William Dickens and James Flynn have operationalized the analogy through a simulation model that produces a large black - white difference from environmental factors even given high heritability ( Dickens and Flynn 2001 ) .
The validity of that model was subsequently disputed by Loehlin ( 2002 ) and Rowe and Rodgers ( 2002 ) , with a reply by Dickens and Flynn ( 2002 ) .
But that debate does not pertain here .
The implications I describe follow simply from knowing that g is highly heritable among blacks , as it is among all groups , and that the black - white difference is largely a difference in g .
71 . See te Nijenhuis , Voskuijl , and Schijve ( 2001 ) , who also found evidence , as did Neubauer and Freudenthaler ( 1994 ) , that coaching also reduced the g-loadedness of the test , and for the obvious reason : noise has been introduced into the IQ score , changing the score but not the thing that makes an IQ test predictive , g .
An athletic analogy may be usefully pursued for understanding these results .
Suppose you have a friend who is a much better athlete than you , possessing better depth perception , hand - eye coordination , strength , and agility .
Both of you try high - jumping for the first time , and your friend beats you .
You practice for two weeks ; your friend does n’t .
You have another contest and you beat your friend .
But if tomorrow you were both to go out together and try tennis for the first time , your friend would beat you , just as your friend would beat you in high - jumping if he practiced as much as you did .
72 . Flynn ( 1984 ) is an early statement .
Over the years since The Bell Curve was published , it has been especially exasperating to be told , or to see it written , that Herrnstein and I were wrong because we did not know about the Flynn effect .
We not only provided the first discussion of the Flynn effect aimed at a general audience ; we named it ( Herrnstein and Murray 1994 : 307–09 ) .
Some scholars , notably J. Philippe Rushton , have subsequently called it the “ Lynn - Flynn effect , ” thereby acknowledging Richard Lynn ’s role in identifying the rise in IQ scores .
73 . Flynn ( 1998 ) .
74 .
An early statement of this evidence , based on analysis of the g loadings of subtests , is Jensen ( 1998 ) : 320 –21 .
Rushton ( 1999 ) elaborates , disputed in Flynn ( 1999 ) and Flynn ( 2000 ) , with a rejoinder in Rushton ( 2000 ) .
Since then the evidence that the Flynn effect does not consist of increases in g has been augmented by an independent method , multigroup confirmatory factor analysis ( MGCFA ) , which permits a test for factorial invariance between cohorts .
In less technical terms , the method tests for whether differences in IQ scores between groups reflects true differences in g .
See Lubke , Dolan , Kelderman et al. ( 2003 ) for a description of the method and its uses .
Wicherts , Dolan , Hessen et al. ( 2004 ) used MGCFA on five large databases : Dutch adults in 1967/68 and 1998/99 ; Danish draftees in 1988 and 1998 ; Dutch high - school students in 1984 and 1994/ 95 ; Dutch children in 1981 / 82 and 1992/93 ; and Estonian children 1934/36 and 1997 /98 .
The authors found that the hypothesis of factor invariance was untenable , and that the gains in intelligence - test scores were not manifestations of increases in g .
Previously , Dolan ( 2000 ) and Dolan & Hamaker ( 2001 ) had used the MGCFA to test for factor invariance between blacks and whites on IQ tests , and had concluded that the results passed the MGCFA test .
In other words , the black - white differences were consistent with a difference in g .
It was this contrast in results that led Wicherts and his colleagues to conclude that the Flynn effect would have little effect on the black - white difference .

In the text I ignore Europe , where both academic and political elites have suppressed the discussion of group differences even more effectively than in America .
Contemporaneously , the European Union has revolutionized free movement within Europe .
That , combined with immigration from outside Europe , legal and illegal , has produced unprecedented population change in countries that historically have been ethnically homogeneous .
Immigration poses problems for European countries that are qualitatively different from those faced by the United States .
Becoming an American requires only that immigrants buy into a set of American ideals .
You can move to America from anywhere in the world , be of any ethnicity , social class , or race , and become an American .
Assimilation is what America does — not as well as it used to , but still pretty well .
The European Union ’s immigration policy has , willy - nilly , decided that now you can move to Denmark and become Danish or move to France and become French .
Is this true ?
Everyday experience suggests that Denmark ’s culture works because it fits the characteristics of Danes , that France ’s culture works because it fits the characteristics of the French , and that these ethnic characteristics are importantly different and deeply rooted , whether in genes or in habits of the heart .
Replace a large proportion of French with Danes — let alone peoples more distant — and French culture will be profoundly changed .
But it is taboo among the elites to talk about such things ( although ordinary people sense what is at stake ) , and so a momentous social experiment is under way without any reason to think that its assumptions are correct , many historical reasons for thinking they are wrong , and recurring stories on the evening news suggesting that the social fabrics of Europe will be shredded before the elites can make themselves come to grips with what they have been doing .
77 .

“ Brain activation during human navigation
Giant unmanned airships to patrol Afghanistan skies for up to three weeks at a time
Giant unmanned airships that can fly for up to three weeks at a time could soon be providing cover for British soldiers in Afghanistan .
The LEMV ( long endurance multi intelligence vehicle ) is being developed by a team of British and American engineers and will give troops on the ground valuable surveillance information .
The helium - filled drone will , when it takes to the skies sometime next summer , become the world ’s longest endurance UAV ( unmanned aerial vehicle ) .
Packed with reconnaissance systems , the LEMV will be able to operate autonomously at altitudes of around 22000 feet for 21 days at a time , and travelling at speeds of up to 80 knots .
The LEMV will be able to stay in the sky for up to three weeks at a time , constantly beaming back information for troops on the ground
Alan Metzger , director for airship programmes at defence firm Northrop Grumman , which received half a billion dollars from the US military for the project , said that the airship ’s ability to stay in the air for long periods make it perfect for surveillance missions .
Mr Metzger told The Engineer magazine : ‘ This is going to be the longest endurance UAV in the world , it ’s got the ability to stay up for three weeks with unblinking stare .
‘ There will be no gaps in the data that gets put down to the war - fighter .
I do n’t know of anything equivalent that could stay up for three or four weeks . ’
The firm claims that the LEMV ’s skin - a blend of Vectran , Kevlar and Mylar - will be able to cope with a reasonable amount of small arms fire from Taliban fighters on the ground .
British engineering firm Hybrid Air Vehicles
Ltd is developing much of the key technology behind the aircraft which , officially , is not a true airship .
Instead it is known as a hybrid air vehicle ( HAV ) and it has a number of advantages over fixed - wing UAVS like the Global Hawk .
A HAV uses aerodynamic lift like a conventional plane to take off before using helium to keep it in the sky once it is airborne .
Engines on board are then used to move while it monitors events on the ground .
The project has received half a billion dollars of US funding and involves British engineers
The LEMV could also be used to move heavy equipment while in Afghanistan , a massive advantage over competing UAVS .
HAV ’s Gordon Taylor told The Engineer : ‘ Traditional airships only float when they ’re in equilibrium .
If you put ten people on board you ’ve got to take ballast off before you go anywhere .
‘ Then , as you fly you burn off fuel becoming too light and making it hard to land : a hybrid overcomes these issues . ’
The aircraft - the first of three similar three similar vehicles - is expected to make its maiden flight next summer and will be deployed in Afghanistan by January 2012 .
There are 7,000 unmanned aerial vehicles in use by the armed forces and the Predator UAV has already been used on many occasions to carry out attacks on Taliban positions in Afghanistan
In March last year an attack by an Israeli UAV was blamed for the deaths of 48 Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip .
The current world record for unmanned flight stands at 31 hours held by Global Hawk , also developed by Northrop Grumman .
As anyone who regularly rides a bicycle knows , this change is big precisely because automobiles and bicycles share much of the same infrastructure .
But this very fact may bode ill for the bicycle in a post - oil future .
U. S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood may soon be nominated for heresy - of - the - year award for an impromptu speech at the 2010 National Bike Summit in March .
In that speech he said federal transportation policy will no longer favor automobiles over bicyclists and walkers .
This distressing line of thought occurred to me recently as I was finishing James Howard Kunstler 's beautifully written post - oil novel , A World Made by Hand .
I spotted not a single bicycle in its 317 pages .
Why ?
Because in the novel the roads upon which one might ride are crumbling beyond passable .
These roads are navigable on foot or by horse , but not particularly by anything on wheels .
But , wait , you may say , bicycles do n't need good roads !
We 'll use trail bikes instead .
All well and good .
Still , where will the rubber for the tires come from ?
What we use now is synthetic rubber made from oil .
Perhaps we 'll get latex from such places as Brazil and Malaysia , that is , unless world trade has broken down .
And , the way in which bicycles are made today , we 'll need aluminum smelting operations for all the aluminum parts , even if only for repairs .
As simple as a bicycle is compared to a car , there is much that ties it to the energy - intensive , global logistics chain .
No doubt we could make bicycle frames out of something other than aluminum .
But again , we must ultimately come back to the question of right - of - way .
If we assume that there will not be sufficient resources to run a nationwide fleet of private automobiles and therefore neither the political will nor the financial capability to pay for the upkeep of our road system , then we must also assume that the bicycle as a widespread form of transportation will not be practical .
Some locales may maintain a few bike trails .
But it is hard to see highways being maintained just so bicycles can ride on them .
Let 's go back a bit in history to understand why .
Bicycles came of age in the latter half of the 19th century .
As such they were manufactured on the industrial model .
Bicycle owners became a potent force for the paving of roads upon which they could then ride .
Ironically , the industrial methods for the manufacture of bicycles and the paved roads which bicycle owners championed became the basis for mass - produced automobiles -- automobiles which ultimately usurped the roads from bicycles .
Now , my apprehension about the future of the bicycle posits that industrial society has sunk into a pretty sorry state and that no forms of motorized land transport for which it is worth maintaining roads survive .
But even if we maintain main roads for , say , intercity buses , that would still leave all the side roads -- roads ideal for bicycle riding -- without maintenance .
I 'm ashamed to say that until reading Kunstler 's novel it had never occurred to me just how dependent my bicycle is on the automotive infrastructure .
Could it be true that the bicycle 's viability is linked to that of the automobile ?
Having said all this , I 'm hoping someone will talk me down and explain how we might be able to have a future filled with bicycling no matter what the fate of the automobile .

How Big is Your Bicycle ? - Phil Hart , December 2007
Questions
1 . Why do roads get so little discussion in planning for the future ?
2 . Can you see a way to make a version of bicycles work with a version of roads , long term ?
3 . What do people do in lesser developed countries do now with respect to bicycles and roads ?
4 . What role do you expect bicycles to play long - term ?
Dozens of gamblers on B.C.'s new casino - style website were able to place bets with other users ' money , forcing the site to shut down almost as soon as it was up and running , the province 's lottery corporation revealed Tuesday .
The B.C. Lottery Corp. added casino games such as blackjack , roulette and craps to its PlayNow.com site last week , but the service was quickly shut down in the midst of an immediate flood of virtual gamblers .
It has remained offline as the Crown corporation investigated a glitch that led some users to be suddenly and inadvertently logged in as others .
The corporation was still working on a fix Tuesday .
BCLC said the increased load caused the switch in some accounts as users played , leading them to place bets with others ' money .
In some cases , the users were able to see the other person 's account balance and personal information .
About 130 people were affected , and the corporation has identified 12 cases in which a user viewed " sensitive " personal information belonging to someone else .
" Some personal information that would be available on a personal cheque was available to other users , " BCLC president Michael Graydon told CTV News .
Some $ 8000 in winnings was deposited into the wrong hands , he said .
" There was a bit of play with other people 's money but as we speak right now the proper money is going to other people 's accounts , " Graydon said .
In another interview , he said that the gamblers involved have been told of the mistake .
" We have contacted all the impacted players and informed them of what has happened , " Graydon told a radio station in Kamloops , B.C. , where the corporation 's headquarters are based .
He said staff have since reviewed winnings and losses from the time of the breach and applied them to the correct accounts .
Last Friday , Graydon said PlayNow.com was n't working simply because too many users caused the servers to crash , but the corporation now admits it shut the site down once it learned about the privacy breach .
The lottery corporation said it 's working with the province 's privacy commissioner to respond , and a third - party investigation uncovered no evidence of hacking .
The privacy commissioner could n't be reached for comment .
PlayNow.com became the first website in North America to offer legal casino - style games when it added them to its existing roster of lottery purchases and sports betting last Thursday .
The province 's social development minister , Rich Coleman , declined comment Tuesday , with his office referring questions back to the lottery corporation .
In announcing the PlayNow.com expansion last week , Coleman said British Columbians gamble an estimated $ 100 million a year with offshore gambling websites .
He said the province wants to encourage those gamblers to spend that money in B.C. , where the government can redirect the profits to services like health care and education .
Coleman also said using a government - operated website would insure their information is protected by the " highest levels of integrity and security of any system in the world . "
Shane Simpson , the housing and social development critic for the Opposition New Democrats , said the breach suggests the lottery corporation did n't do its homework to ensure the website would be secure .
" That raises real questions about whether the lottery corporation and the minister rushed into getting this thing out there , " Simpson said in an interview .
" It 's another of these issues that raise questions of confidence . "
Meanwhile , the lottery corporation was also facing criticism Tuesday after the revelation it has received hefty fines from the federal agency that monitors money laundering and terrorism financing .
The lottery corporation confirmed the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada -- also known as FINTRAC -- fined it more than half a million dollars for more than a thousand infractions related to reporting requirements .
FINTRAC says there are a number of ways criminals can use casinos to launder money , and requires casinos and provincial gambling regulators to file regular reports to help track suspicious activity .
Click here for a speech by FINTRAC 's director on efforts to combat money laundering .
Graydon suggested the fines were merely administrative rather than an indication anything nefarious was happening .
Most of those , too , were blamed on a computer glitch that sent filed reports back to B.C. Lotteries .
By the time they were re-sent , they were late , he said .
But they were n't all the computer 's fault .
In about 230 cases , casino staff failed to obtain enough information from people spending more than $ 10,000 .
For such large transactions , the casino is required to check ID and ask a number of questions , including what the person 's occupation is , but the reports submitted did n't include detailed enough information .

But the focus on the plain - sect dairy farmers is unavoidable : they own more than 50 percent of Lancaster County ’s 5,000 - plus farms .
“ It ’s been an issue over the last 30 years , ” Dr. Kraybill said .
“ We have too many animals here per square acre  too many cows for too few acres . ”
For now , the environmental agency ’s strategy is to approach each farmer individually in collaboration with state and local conservation officials and suggest improvements like fences to prevent livestock from drifting toward streams , buffers that reduce runoff and pits to keep manure stored safely .
“ These are real people with their own histories and their own needs and their own culture , ” said John Hanger , the secretary of environmental protection in Pennsylvania .
“ It ’s about treating people right , and in order to treat people right , you ’ve got to be able to start where they are at . ”
But if that does not work , the government will have to resort to fines and penalties .
Last September , Mr. McGuigan and his colleagues visited 24 farms in a pocket of Lancaster County known as Watson ’s Run to assess their practices .
Twenty - three of the farms were plain sect ; 17 were found to be managing their manure inadequately .
The abundance of manure was also affecting water quality .
Six of the 19 wells sampled contained E. coli bacteria , and 16 had nitrate levels exceeding those allowed by the E.P.A .
Persuading plain - sect farmers to install fences and buffers underwritten by federal grants has been challenging because of their tendency to shy from government programs , including subsidies .
Members neither pay Social Security nor receive its benefits , for example .

Word of the E.P.A. ’s farm visits last September traveled rapidly through Amish country , Mr. Stoltzfus said , even though most plain - sect farmers do not have their own phones .
Getting unit testing , code coverage , and benchmarks right is mostly about picking the right tools .
test - framework provides a one - stop shop to run all your HUnit test - cases and QuickCheck properties all from one harness .
Code coverage is built into GHC in the form of the HPC tool .
Criterion provides some pretty great benchmarking machinery
I 'll use as a running example a package that I just started enabling with unit testing , code coverage , and benchmarks :
http://github.com/ekmett/speculation
You can integrate your tests and benchmarks directly into your cabal file by adding sections for them , and masking them behind flags so that they do n't make it so that every user of your library has to have access to ( and want to use for themselves ) the exact version of the testing tools you 've chosen .
http://github.com/ekmett/speculation/blob/master/speculation.cabal
Then , you can tell cabal about how to run your test suite .
As cabal test does n't yet exist -- we have a student working on it for this year 's summer of code ! -- the best mechanism we have is
Here is how to use cabal 's user hook mechanism .
This means switching to a ' Custom ' build with cabal and setting up a testHook .
An example of a testHook that runs a test program written with test - framework , and then applies hpc to profile it can be found here :
http://github.com/ekmett/speculation/blob/master/Setup.lhs
And then you can use test - framework to bundle up QuickCheck and HUnit tests into one program :
http://github.com/ekmett/speculation/blob/master/Test.hs
The cabal file there is careful to turn on - fhpc to enable code coverage testing , and then the testHook in Setup.lhs manually runs hpc and writes its output into your dist dir .
For benchmarking , the story is a little more manual , there is no ' cabal benchmark ' option .
You could wire your benchmarks into your test hook , but I like to run them by hand , since Criterion has so many graphical reporting options .
You can add your benchmarks to the cabal file as shown above , give them separate compilation flags , hide them behind a cabal flag , and then use Criterion to do all the heavy lifting :
http://github.com/ekmett/speculation/blob/master/Benchmark.hs
You can then run your benchmarks from the command line and get pop -up KDE windows with benchmark results , etc .
Since in practice you 're living in cabal anyways while developing Haskell code , it makes a lot of sense to integrate your toolchain with it .
Edit : Cabal test support now does exist .
See http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-latest/doc/users-guide/developing-packages.html#test-suites
Blast - proof curtain that gets thicker when it is stretched to be used to protect terror targets
A new type of blast - proof curtain that gets thicker rather than thinner when stretched is being developed to protect potential terrorist targets .
The new curtain remains intact and captures debris such as flying glass when windows are blown in .
The project is primarily designed to be fixed over the windows of potential terrorist targets , such as Government and high - profile commercial properties .
Scroll down to see a video on how the technology works
[ caption ]
Professor Ken Evans , at the University of Exeter , who is leading the project , said : ' In the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing , glass accounted for nearly two thirds of all eye and head injuries .
' The blast curtain we 're working on , which will be capable of dispersing the shock from an explosion extremely effectively , will be backed up by robust scientific understanding vital to ensuring it really can block flying debris and achieve widespread use . '
Potential uses could also include protecting people in buildings from the effects of severe weather events such as typhoons and hurricanes , the university said .
The new curtain aims to remove the need for anti-shatter films by using stronger , more resilient fibres woven into a carefully controlled textile structure .
The secret lies in the yarn the curtain is made from , the university said .
The yarn is an ‘ auxetic ’ material – one that gets thicker when stretched .
A stretchy fibre provides the core of the yarn and a stiffer fibre is then wound around it .
When the stiffer fibre is put under strain , it straightens , causing the stretchy fibre to bulge out sideways - increasing the yarn 's diameter .
As well as thickening , small pores open up in the fibres when they are stretched .
These pores are designed to let through some of an explosion 's shock wave , ensuring it does n't rip .
At just 1 - 2 mm thick , the new type of curtain can also be designed to let in a reasonable amount of natural light .
It is currently being tested in situations similar to car bomb explosions .
Testing at a Government - approved facility has already started , and after rigorous certification procedures , the new curtain could be on the market within three to five years .
Researchers also believe that the technology could have applications in other fields , including ' self - healing ' bandages .
Wounds that swell would put the bandage under tension opening up pores that are impregnated with an antibiotic which would then be released .
It could also be used to manufacture dental floss that expands when you pull it , to fill in gaps to make cleaning more effective for teeth .
McDonald 's Happy Meals have been in the headlines lately , with activist group Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) threatening to sue them for " using toys to lure small children into McDonald's . "
The official response from the CEO of the nation 's purveyors of burgers and fries is in , and it 's kind of badass :
CSPI 's twisted characterization of McDonald 's as " the stranger in the playground handing out candy to children " is an insult to every one of our franchisees and employees around the world .
When CSPI refers to America 's children as " an unpaid drone army , " you similarly denigrate parents and families , because they are fully capable of making their own decisions .
You should apologize … .
The public does not support your lawsuit .
Internet sites , blogs and network surveys suggest that public opinion is running overwhelmingly against your premise .
Our customer websites and phone lines at McDonald 's are also busy , with more than nine out of 10 customers disagreeing with your agenda .
Parents , in particular , strongly believe they have the right and responsibility to decide what 's best for their children , not CSPI .
It really is that simple .
Next step : McDonald 's CEO vows to include tiny airline - sized bottle of vodka in special edition adults - only Happy Meals .
Sigh .
If only …
Happy Meals are still in trouble in Santa Clara county , however .
Recently by Peter Schiff : The New Ideological Divide
If you want to understand what ’s happening to the world economy , read Peter Schiff ’s new book ( co- written with his brother Andrew ) : How an Economy Grows and Why it Crashes .
You do n’t need any background in economics to understand it ; an intelligent child could follow its arguments .
I mean that quite seriously .
When Peter and Andrew were small boys , their father , Irwin Schiff , an anti-Keynesian economist and tax refusenik , used to tell them stories as a way of teaching them basic economic principles .

Imagine , for example , three men on an island , each of whom catches one fish per day .
It takes all day to catch a fish with your hands , and you need to eat one fish each day .
Then suppose that one man chooses to go hungry for 24 hours and uses the time to make a net , allowing him to catch two fish per day .
What should he then do with his extra fishes ?
Should he lend his surplus fish to the other men , enabling them to eat while building their own nets ?
( Their nets might fail , meaning that he would lose his investment ; but he could compensate for the risk by demanding that they pay him back two fish for his loan of one . )
Should he build two more nets and rent them out to the others ?
Or should he simply consume his extra daily fish ?

The Schiff brothers begin with this simple thought - experiment , and build it up , gradually introducing the concepts of specialisation and comparative advantage , inter - island trade , paper money , government , taxation and national debt .
In simple language , and with logical steps , they take the island from its three - man closed economy to , as it were , the present day : a bubble in hut prices which prompts an unwise island senate to print more and more fish - credit - notes .
Why should we pay attention to Peter Schiff ?
Well , here ’s one pretty convincing reason : he accurately and exactly predicted the recent crash .
I do n’t just mean that he said that there were bad times coming .
A man who constantly predicts downturns will necessarily be correct every ten years or so .
No , I mean that he foresaw the collapse in sub - prime mortgages , that he was right about when it would happen and that he explained why it would happen .
He has , in short , earned the right to be listened to .
I wish I had had this book to read ten years ago .
When I was first elected , I felt I ought to acquire a basic grasp of economics , so I set myself a reading list , starting with that trusty companion to first - year economics students , Begg , Fischer and Dornbusch .
As I ploughed through the various texts , I became disquieted .
So much accepted doctrine seemed counter - intuitive .
Why , for example , did economists see consumer demand as a cause of economic growth rather than a consequence of it ?
Why was it desirable to spend more when nothing of real value was being produced in consequence ?
Why did almost every expert applaud the disconnection between currency and anything of intrinsic value , such as gold ?
Did n’t this breakage allow governments , in effect , to transfer wealth from private savers to themselves ?

Rage after the Raid Israel 's Voyage into Isolation
After last Monday 's raid on a flotilla of peace activists heading toward the Gaza Strip , Israel finds itself on the defensive .
Not only has Turkey turned its back on the country , but the US too is angered by the unilateralism of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu .
By SPIEGEL Staff
Europe is in turmoil .
And we are told to be afraid – for our safety , our culture , our jobs , our freedoms , our comfort , our future .
We are told that there is no alternative – to the loss of job security , to diminishing salaries and prolonged working lives , to turning our neighbourhoods , our cities and our countries into fenced camps protected from designated enemies – the immigrants , the poor , the culturally , religiously , and ethnically different .
Is this the way forward in a Europe that is now home to millions of people from different backgrounds , many religious and cultural dispositions , and many cross - border connections ?
In this Europe it makes no sense to close the borders , to play the game of good insiders and bad outsiders , to defend ethnic and cultural purity , to demonise everything alien .
The xenophobic rhetoric that now pervades the public sphere is diverting attention away from the urgent issues of the day – tackling economic and social hazard and uncertainty with new ideas and practices , and inventing new ways of living together amid growing social and cultural complexity .
We , a group of concerned citizens , invoke the political responsibility of Europe 's opinion - makers and political leaders .
We demand the cessation of the politics of fear and engagement in the politics of hope .
Otherwise Europe once again might find itself enmeshed in a long , dark period of hate and animosity from which it will be hard to return , and which will – as in the past – result in friends becoming enemies , capable of unthinkable monstrosities .
We are close to the brink of no return .
It is this sense of urgency that prompts this manifesto – an appeal to all those living in Europe , those concerned for its present and its future , to join us in imagining and implementing an inclusive politics befitting the 21st century .
A new inclusive politics in Europe must embrace and build on at least four core principles :
1. Diversity as the essence of Europe
The vision of an authentic and pure , culturally homogenous Europe is nothing but a fiction , yet a powerful and a dangerous one .
Let us recall , and let us admit , that for its best achievements Europe has always drawn on the creative energies of the world , on the positive engagement among people of diverse descent and complex biographies , on the respect for gender , racial , sexual , religious , cultural differences and preferences .
It is this tradition of openness and inclusion , and not Europe 's other , darker , legacy of supposed superiority , closure and suspicion that needs to be revived in facing an uncertain and turbulent future .
2 . An ethos of solidarity and hope
If there is uncertainty and turbulence to face , history shows that this is best done through courage and dialogue , not fear and intolerance .
The politics of fear that pervades European society must be exposed , rejected and make way for an ethos of facing the future with courage by mobilising the collective energies of diverse publics .
Such an ethos would enable us to confront the common concerns of all members of European society independently of their origin – an ethos of hope not fear , trust not suspicion , reciprocity not domination , dialogue not condemnation , negotiation not aggression .
3 . Protecting the commons
A shared sense of purpose centred on a reinvigorated notion of " the commons " is needed – a notion of generating and safeguarding our shared cultural , economic and social environment , alongside protecting the natural environment against pollution and consumption .
Key elements of such politics of the commons are the maintenance of an active public sphere , decent public services and vibrant public spaces , environmental respect and protection , insurance against hazard and risk , utilities and technologies that enable rather than disable .
Above all , a culture of respect for the commons should become a means of reconciling difference .
4. Inclusive economy
Issues of cultural policy are inseparable from issues of economic policy .
Economic solidarity is indispensable both for fostering tolerance and for achieving inclusion .
We therefore need policies that build on the European heritage of social fairness : a social economy that spreads opportunities and rewards ; universal social insurance ; corporate social responsibility ; work for all and fair wages , along with continuous building of human capabilities .
In line with this tradition , which goes beyond particular ideological belongings and partisanship , a regulatory reform is now urgently needed to ensure the submission of the needs of the markets to those of societies .
It is through such policies that future growth can be directed to the many and not only the few , and thus generate social attitudes and practices that oppose envy and enmity .
Let us oppose , together , the culture of emergency management based on obsessive surveillance , control and vilification of the strange and the different .
Let us create , instead , a culture of solidarity and common purpose beyond our differences .
Let us declare our repulsion for the unfair and unequal society that blames its own victims and casualties .
Let us revive our belief in the powers of democracy , fairness and social justice for the many .
Let us establish a new set of rules , based on co-operation and reciprocity , in Europe 's relations with all those countries where life – human and other – most often is the cheapest commodity .
Let us accept that curiosity and learning from others remain the surest way of negotiating an unknown future .
Our appeal is as ambitious as it is simple : to see the concerns that face us all as the best basis for collective action , the guide for democratic politics in Europe ; and to acknowledge the potential of living within difference in Europe as the best resource we have to responsibly confront the challenges ahead .

How to Acclimate to Cold Water 6 of 8
If you are going to be exposed to cold water at a triathlon or a non-wetsuit swimming event it might be a good idea to develop cold tolerance and the associated physiological adaptations .
While it seems like a smart move , you have to admit that the thought of swimming in a lake with ice floating on it does n't seem like any fun .
So what to do ?
First , know there are no studies that outline the perfect formula for adapting to cold water .
Most of the recommendations in this column come from a combination of personal experiences and the experiences of others .
If you have access to an open water situation with temperatures similar to those predicted for your event , swim in the cold water for 20 to 30 minutes , three to four times a week in the 14 to 21 days prior to the event .
If it will be a wetsuit swim , wear a wetsuit in practice .
Be sure to have a boat or rescue person available in case you run into trouble .
For those that do not have access to a cold body of open water , you may gain some advantage by taking cold baths .
Fill your tub with cold water from the faucet and get in the tub .
When your body feels comfortable in the water , you can down - regulate the temperature by adding ice .
Those using this technique have taken an ice bath for roughly 15 to 20 minutes , three times per week .
Bath temperature , as far as I know , has not dipped below 50 degrees .
Should You Practice with a Wetsuit ?
I have been asked if people should wear a wetsuit in the cold bathwater because they will be wearing a wetsuit on race day .
I can't tell you if there are particular benefits one way or the other .
All the athletes I 've worked with have cold - tubbed sans wetsuit .
The people that have used the two cold water acclimatization techniques mentioned in this column have all noted an increased tolerance for cold water .
Each time they were exposed to the cold in training , they said that they felt less cold than the previous time .
All have commented that they felt more confident and believed they were less stressed about cold water conditions than other competitors on race day .

AS THEY contemplate high unemployment , foreclosed homes , shrivelled house prices and the arrogant follies of their investment bankers , Americans may cast envious glances across their northern border .
Despite its umbilical links with America , Canada 's economy suffered only a mild recession and is now well into a solid recovery .
The Canadian dollar , having dipped sharply , is back up to rough parity with the greenback .
The Bank of Canada has signalled that it may soon raise interest rates .
When Stephen Harper , the prime minister , hosts the get - togethers of the G8 and G20 countries next month he will be able to boast to his visitors that his country 's economy is set to perform better than that of any other rich country this year .
How has Canada avoided the plagues that are afflicting everyone else ?
The short answer is a mixture of good policies and good luck ( see article ) .
The main reason for the country 's economic resilience is that neither its financial system nor its housing market magnified the recession .
The banks remained in profit .
House prices held up fairly well and are now rising .
And for that regulators deserve a chunk of the credit .
Canada 's banks face high capital requirements and a cap on their leverage , such that their assets cannot exceed 20 times their capital ( a lot less than the corresponding figure for many Wall Street firms and European banks ) .
Canadians who take out mortgages worth more than 80 % of the value of the property must also take out insurance against default from a federal agency , the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation .
The banks must insure the rest of their mortgage book with the corporation .
It helped , too , that Canada has a single banking regulator .
The big five banks snapped up the leading stockbroking firms in the 1990s , becoming universal banks .
But , whether through luck or judgment , they never became too dependent on investment banking .
And , mirabile dictu , their shareholders managed to ensure that bankers ' bonuses were kept within modest bounds .
Many of these rules embody lessons learned the hard way from banking collapses in the mid-1980s .
Something similar goes for the public finances .
By 1995 Canada 's chronic fiscal deficits , towering public debt and stagnant economy prompted the Wall Street Journal to call it “ an honorary member of the Third World ” .
Years of deficit cutting followed .
The result was that Mr Harper 's government could easily afford the modest stimulus it applied in 2008 .
Government debt in Canada is still below 36 % of GDP ( and will soon fall ) , little more than half the ( rising ) ratio in the United States .
But there is also a large dollop of good fortune behind Canada 's resilience .
If parts of eastern Canada resemble Europe in economic terms , the west looks more like Brazil .
Its mines , oil and gas producers and farmers have benefited from the commodity boom brought about by China 's appetite for raw materials .
This boom brings a problem : it is helping to drive up the Canadian dollar , which risks making life more difficult for manufacturers back east .
And Canada 's fiscal health will soon come under strain from the treasured but expensive public health - care system and an ageing population .
There is little sign that the country 's politicians are ready to deal with either .
The costs and benefits of conservative banking
How much of the Canadian model can , or should , be exported ?
Critics of the Canadian banks reckon that their conservatism was the flip side of a cosy oligopoly .
The big five were barred from merging and partly protected from foreign interlopers .
They shared out a profitable domestic market and gave up competing on price .
And keeping tabs on the banks is much easier when all are relatively small by international standards and are based within a few hundred yards of each other and of regulators in Toronto .
The result is that Canadians pay more for financial services than others and there is little innovation .
Even so , as taxpayers elsewhere dig deep to pay for their bankers ' wheezes they might think that Canadians got a bargain .
Replicating Canadian banking elsewhere would be hard .
But when Americans and Europeans press Mr Harper at the G20 meeting to accept a tax on banks to curb their riskiness , he has reason to retort that Canadian - style regulation does the job better .
Cristiano Ronaldo , the Real Madrid forward and Portugal captain , has used his imagination productively by naming his son Cristiano Ronaldo , his sister , Katia , has revealed .
" The baby is doing very well , his sister said .
" We are looking after him while Cristiano is away .
He 's called Cristiano just like his dad .
Cristiano chose the name but we like it .
He looks like his father and like me .
He has the same eyes .
We do n't know the mother , we never met her . "
Ronaldo , who is believed to be on holiday in the United States with his girlfriend Irina Shayk , announced last week that he had become a father on his Twitter feed and Facebook wall but has refused to reveal the identity of the child 's mother .
This secrecy has led to speculation in the Portuguese press that the baby is the product of a surrogacy arrangement .
" Some people may think it 's strange , but we do n't .
We 're very happy about what Cristiano has done , " said Katia .
Ronaldo's mother Dolores , 55 , confirmed her grandson had been born in the US , but the family refused to elaborate on the rumours about the details of the boy 's parentage .
Primates and crocodiles from central and west Africa among animals found in luggage by customs officials
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Several tonnes of illegal " bushmeat " from animals ranging from primates to crocodiles are being smuggled in luggage each week through one of Europe 's busiest airports , researchers said today .
Animal experts worked with customs officials at Paris 's Charles de Gaulle airport to identify meat from species being carried into Europe from central and west Africa .
Over a period of 17 days , 134 passengers from 29 flights were searched and almost half were found to be carrying fish or meat from livestock or wild animals .
The researchers found 11 different " bushmeat " or meat from wild animal species including Nile crocodiles , red river hog , primates , porcupines and pangolins .
The probe found two - fifths ( 39 % ) of the wild species smuggled in were subject to trade regulations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) .
Livestock including entire sheep and calves wrapped in plastic and placed in holdalls were also uncovered during the research .
The experts from the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) , the Royal Veterinary College ( RVC ) , the National Veterinary School and the Natural History Museum of Toulouse estimate some five tonnes of bushmeat pass through the airport in personal luggage each week .
Smuggling meat in luggage such as holdalls poses a major risk to human health and could spread disease , while the bushmeat trade also poses a threat to wildlife , they warned .
Dr Anne-Lise Chaber , from ZSL and the RVC , said : " Our results estimate that around 270 tonnes of potentially contaminated illegal bushmeat is passing unchecked through a single European airport per year , posing a huge potential risk to potential public health . "
And the study , which is published today in the journal Conservation Letters , said the nature of the imports suggested there was a growing luxury market for the meat and it was being brought in for trade and not simply personal consumption .
Co-author Dr Marcus Rowcliffe , from ZSL , said : " Our results show that this is a lucrative , organised trade feeding into a luxury market ; a 4kg monkey will cost around € 100 ( £ 84 ) in France , compared with just € 5 ( £ 4 ) in Cameroon .
" Importing bushmeat is relatively easy , as customs officials are given no financial incentives to uncover illegal meat imports , compared with the bonuses they 're awarded for drug and counterfeit seizures .
" Also , penalties are very low for people caught carrying illegal meat . "
You all know these streets : where a 40 mph zone turns into a 25 mph zone for no reason , and there ’s always an officer conveniently taking radar ?
Is n’t that annoying ?
But you know what ’s more annoying than that ?
When you work up the courage to finally learn to ride a bicycle , only to have nay - sayers tell you things like , “ You need to let go of the hand brake , ” or “ Bikes do n’t work under water . ”
Listen , maybe I ’m learning to swim as well , and I ’m trying to knock out two rites of passage at once , ever think of that ?
In fact , it ’s better that way .
I think we should lump all rites of passage together and get them all done in one day .
It would save on ink , since you would only have to print one photograph instead of multiple photographs , and it would save paper , since you would n’t need multi-page photo albums anymore ; rather , just a jacket with one page in it , and point to that one photo and say , “ This was the day I learned everything . ”
It would really suck if the sun drowned out the image , though , and you did n’t find out until you got the film developed .
Well , that teaches you to use a 35 mm camera when you could have gone digital , gramps .
Fag
This is what I heard someone call my little boy today .
I did n’t ignore it .
I asked .
I glared .
What did you say ?
The kid muttered under his breath .
Nothing .
We walked to the car and he was quiet .
He ’s a boy who takes everything into himself .
When he shares , it ’s a gift .
It has a meaning beyond what it is .
I looked at him , my beautiful nine - year - old boy who grew in my belly as I spent endless hours working with men and women dying of AIDS in Los Angeles .
The baby that I jostled and jiggled when I was nine months pregnant , shaking my fat little ass at the Dance - a - thon .
All the beautiful queens circled around me under the disco ball and rubbed my belly just like the old Russian women at the K - Mart by the Farmer ’s Market .
I remember looking at them , these glittering beautiful people smiling and wishing me luck .
They are celebrating you , I said to my unborn child .
They are celebrating life .
It was one of the few nights that I did n’t have to face the practical realities of the other side of the coin , the side where I watched my friends wasting away to nothing .
When I had my baby shower , I was living with a friend who everyone thought was my gay lover .
I never cared what anyone thought .
We were like sisters .
She was a nurse who worked with HIV / AIDS patients .
I was a lawyer who did n’t like seeing decent people being bullied and treated like shit .
We were comrades in arms .
People were suffering so much , being locked out of their apartments , being fired from jobs , being dropped from their insurance , being ignored by their own families .
So very few people really cared .
It still makes me want to howl with the pain of it all when I remember how horrible it was , how tremendously unfair , how incredibly fucking cruel people could be .
My shower was attended by four beautiful fat dykes , nine fabulously gay men , a Liberian woman whose asylum case I 'd won that year , and a straight couple that I ’d kept in touch with after law school .
That next week , my mom came and marched at Pride .
We laughed about whether I was going to deliver my baby on the parade route .
It was a golden day .
It shook me more than usual to hear a nondescript man hiss “ faggots ” as we walked back to the car with a couple of friends .
When he was a little boy , he would tell me he was going to be a girl .
I told him he could be whatever he wanted .
I did n’t think anything about it .
Kids do n’t have much of a concept of gender at two .
It 's like my friend 's daughter who told him she was going to grow " big hairy breasts just like Daddy . "
A few years later , he was playing the game of Life with his brother and declared that he was going to marry a boy .
He was six .
His four - year - old brother insisted that he could n’t marry a boy .
He has to marry a girl , does n’t he , Mom ?
I told them that each of them could marry a boy or a girl .
It does n’t matter as long as you are happy and a good person .
He happily zoomed along in his car with two little plastic blue guys in the front seat .
That was the same year that he liked to wear my lip gloss .
I did n’t care .
I ’d hand it over any time he asked for it .
There were other small but similar things every once in a while , all noted but not given much weight or concern .
So here was my golden boy , born at a time in my life when I was acutely aware of the powers of both love and hatred , chewing his nails in the backseat , trying not to cry .
He looked up at me with his giant green eyes .
I could tell he was phrasing his question very carefully , as he is such a precise little boy .
" I ’m not a fag if I do n’t want to have a girlfriend , am I ? "
He was so quiet and serious .
I pulled over and turned around to face him .
I wanted to tell him about the time into which he was born , how so many people loved him , how so many people saw him as the sign of a good and hopeful future they might not live to see .
I wanted to tell him how the woman who came into my office after he was born wept with him in her arms and kissed him all over .
I did n’t take him from her until he was sleeping and her tears had been replaced with a soft smile .
“ No one has ever let me touch a baby since I was diagnosed , ” she told me in Spanish , “ He ’s so beautiful .
Thank you . ”
There are so many stories I will have for him , when he is ready to hear them .
I looked at him and said , “ You are not a fag , period .
It does n’t matter if you like girls , or if you like boys .
It does n’t matter at all .
And you are not a fag no matter what .
It ’s a hateful word that stupid people use to hurt each other . ”
That ’s all I could say today .
I did n't know what else to say .
Is my son gay ?
I do n’t know .
I do n’t care .
He ’ll figure it out .
Either way , when he ’s old enough to understand , he ’ll hear the stories of the year he was born .
He ’ll know he ’s special , and he ’ll understand why the word “ fag ” will never touch him again .

John McCain John Sidney McCainBudowsky : Senate 's Trump Republicans on trial , in trouble America 's presence in Cam Ranh Bay should be more than occasional Meghan McCain , husband welcome first baby girl , Liberty Sage McCain Domenech MORE -- one of President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing

A flotilla of several ships set sail to deliver aid supplies to the Gaza Strip on Monday , but Israeli commandos boarded the ships after warning them not to attempt to dock at Gaza , which is controlled by Islamic extremist group Hamas .
After an altercation between the activists and troops aboard the ships , Israeli troops opened fire and killed nine of them .

McCain ( R ) , Obama 's opponent in the 2008 presidential election , said the White House should have offered a more forceful defense of the U.S. 's Middle Eastern ally .
" This is another step in a chain of unfortunate events beginning with President Obama 's insistence there be a freeze as a precondition for peace talks [ with the Palestinians ] ; a freeze on settlements in Jerusalem .
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel , not a settlement , " he said on Fox News on Tuesday night .
" The mistaken belief that pressuring Israel on settlement freeze would somehow move them closer and show the Arab world that they were putting pressure on Israel has backfired . "
The incident has touched off a diplomatic firestorm .
Many European nations and Turkey -- the nations from which the ships set sail -- condemned Israel 's actions .
The White House on Tuesday condemned the loss of life , but did not specifically criticize Israel 's actions .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs echoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that also called for an investigation of the incident .
Israel said the blockade is in place to stop the flow of weapons to Gaza and Hamas , which is committed to overthrowing the state of Israel .
The Israeli government said that the fight on board the ship was started by the activists , who were armed with metal chairs and baseball bats , among other primitive weapons .
The activists said that the Israeli troops provoked the violence and that the blockade is inhumane .
Vocal supporters of Israel in both parties issued statements Tuesday saying that they stand by the Jewish State , though reaction from Congress was generally quiet during the recess week .
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor Eric Ivan CantorThe Hill 's Campaign Report : Florida hangs in the balance Eric Cantor teams up with former rival Dave Brat in supporting GOP candidate in former district Bottom line MORE ( R - Va. ) , the only Jewish Republican in Congress , pressured Obama not to sign any potential security council resolution that appears " biased " against Israel .
But McCain 's comments suggest that debate amongst lawmakers over the U.S. 's sometimes shaky relationship with Israel under the Obama administration could heat up again .
" The fact is that this nation has stood by Israel , " he said .
" And now , people around the world , including Israel 's enemies , are not so sure . "
Gibbs said at his daily press briefing Tuesday that the U.S. continues to support Israel 's security needs .
“ Let me be clear here : The United States and Israel — as I have said on countless occasions , we have a trusted relationship , ” Gibbs said .
“ They are an important — have been an important ally .
And we are greatly supportive of their security .
That ’s not going to change . "
Even though we highly doubt there will be another Lost - type TV show for some time , NBC 's certainly angling its new series , The Event that way — with a 24 twist .
Will these new clips make you watch the series ?

The Event , which will be on Mondays at 9 PM , has a pretty bare - bones synopsis :
When an average guy stumbles upon a secret so powerful it could change the course of humanity , and a cover - up so big that the President is on a need - to - know basis , answers can only lead to bigger questions .

And from what we 've seen in the past , it still feels like Lost with spies — and Laura Innes is Ben .
Our biggest hope for this series is that it spends time developing the characters , and less time throat - punching guys in ski masks and blowing stuff up .
But from what we 've seen thus far , we 're not sure which way this series will go .

Over in the Suggestion Pot , Gnome Stew reader renner asked us to write an article on this topic :
How do you handle a narrative combat ?
Mainly , if you are used to miniatures and maps , and do n’t want to use them anymore .
Prior to D&D 3.0 , the majority of RPGs used narrative combat — IE , combat that ’s largely descriptive , with a sketchy map if a map is used at all .
From D&D 3e ’s launch onwards , battlemap - driven combat , complete with minis , grids , and tactical movement , has become much more common and popular .
( For simplicity , I ’m going to call the latter “ tactical combat ” from here on out . )
My GMing experience is primarily with narrative combat , although I ’ve run my share of campaigns with tactical combat , too .
As a player , my experience is pretty evenly mixed .
I like both styles for different reasons , and this article wo n’t be about the merits of one approach over the other .
When the gnomes were kicking renner ’s request around on our mailing list , DNAphil had this to say :
Here is where you need to think of combat as dramatic and not tactical .
Narrative combat exists more in description and less in maps .
I like to use a simple map , drawn on a white board , not to scale .
Just something to give the players their barrings .
In narrative combat , when you finish a player ’s turn or full round , give a recap of the action that has just happened .
Think of it like a movie .
Wave your arms around , make crazy sounds , describe it so the players can feel it .
Finally , in a narrative combat , give your players more leeway with what they want to do .
In a tactical combat , you move X squares and your gun reaches Y yards away .
In narrative combat , you may have movement rules , but if a player is just outside their range , let them have it , its not like you have a detailed map to scale .
As an overview of the high points of narrative combat , and the ways it differs from tactical combat , this is excellent —
Phil knows his stuff .
Using Phil ’s comments as a jumping - off point , here ’s my take on narrative combat .
Get Everyone
On the Same Page
Being on the same page with your players is critical , especially if your group is used to tactical combat — switching to narrative combat can take some getting used to .
It seems obvious , but make sure your group knows going in that the game you ’re going to run will feature narrative combat , and if necessary explain what that will mean :
No tactical grids , no round - by - round tracking of position , no miniatures , and overall a greater emphasis on roleplaying over tactics .
Use the Tools at Hand
If you ’re running a game that ’s built for narrative combat , the rules should cover not only how combat works but how to make it enjoyable — use those tools .
Once your group knows how combat works , they ’ll see that pinpointing where PC A is relative to NPC X does n’t matter so much , and shift their focus elsewhere .
Many games do n’t really address narrative vs. tactical combat , though , instead assuming you ’ll pick whatever works best for you .
With those games , you ’ll have to choose what you want to emphasize about narrative combat in play .
Dramatic and Cinematic
Narrative combat tends to focus more on the drama of the scene , and is often more cinematic than tactical combat .
This is n’t to say that there is n’t plenty of room for both of those elements in tactical combat , just that in my experience they ’re backgrounded .
In narrative combat , they ’re foregrounded .
Like Phil said up top , play up these aspects of the scene .
Use evocative descriptions and encourage your players to do the same .
Let players who like to describe the results of their PCs ’ actions themselves to it with a flourish , and for those who prefer to have you describe what happens , do it with gusto .
Describe with Precision
If nothing is precisely mapped , everyone has to rely on your description of the combat when deciding what to do .
Just because you have a clear vision of the battlefield in your head , do n’t assume that your players do .
Sketch out the area on a whiteboard , a sheet of paper , whatever you have at hand .
Point out spots that afford cover , dangerous hazards , and whatever else the PCs would know about the area .
To Map or Not to Map ?
While drawing a sketchy map of the battlefield up front is almost always a good idea , updating that map as combat progresses is a slippery slope .
If you update it every round , you ’re now edging into tactical combat territory — and giving up the flexibility that makes narrative combat so much fun .
But if you never update the map at all , or refuse to map anything as a matter of policy , that ’s even worse .
You ca n’t be sure your players know what ’s going on without mapping things out at least occasionally , so do n’t forget that a battle map — however sketchy it may be — is still a valuable tool .
Play Loose
Phil mentioned this , and it ’s a great point :
In general , play a bit looser than you would with a battlemap and minis .
If some aspect of combat needs to be decided and there ’s no obvious answer , give the PC (s ) involved the edge or the benefit of the doubt .
Do n’t ignore the rules , but do n’t dick your players over by worrying about how many feet apart everyone is at every moment — and , conversely , do n’t be drawn into arguments over precise positioning and the like .
In narrative combat , that stuff takes a distinct backseat to just having fun .
Cool Stuff Should Happen Often
One of the things I love about narrative combat is that with the focus shifted off the minutiae of tactical movement , counting squares , precise positioning , etc. , it ’s a lot easier for cool stuff to happen .
I always find that when the constraints of the rules are less obvious , as tends to be the case with narrative combat , I and my players tend to try more wild stuff , do things that just sound cool , and generally relax and have a different kind of fun .
Encourage this .
Give bonuses for doing cool things , hand out action points for awesome descriptions , and generally reward your players for using the narrative aspects of combat to make the game more fun for everyone .
Learn as You Go
Like any other aspect of GMing , if you ’re transitioning from a tactical combat - driven RPG like D&D 3.x and 4e to a system that uses narrative combat , expect everyone to make the occasional mistakes .
In play , handle them however makes the most sense at the time : retcon something if it does n’t require redoing whole rounds of combat , or say “ We ’ll table that one to discuss after the game ” to avoid getting bogged down .
It ’ll get easier with time !
What Else ?
This is a big topic , and I ’m sure there are things I missed — what else would be good for renner , or any other GM trying out narrative combat for the first time , to know ?

[ She Finds ]
Whenever revolutionary change appears in the world , whether for good or for ill , there are always certain groups of people who fail or refuse to recognize how much things have truly changed .
One can find many examples of this phenomenon in the business world , when entrepreneurs who fail to appreciate new market conditions get tossed aside by their competitors before they even know what hit them .
By the time they realize that they have made serious forecasting errors , it is often far too late for them to catch up .
Similar examples abound in the academic and athletic worlds , where scholars and coaches who fail to appreciate radically new conditions in their disciplines or sports find themselves quickly surpassed by their rivals and colleagues .
You & the Police !
Kenneth W. Royce Best Price : $ 2.00 Buy New $ 61.09 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
A similar situation appears in the realm of law enforcement in the United States , because police officers and their political bosses seem to be oblivious to the fact that the American economic and political landscape has profoundly changed over the last three years .
They continue to humiliate , bully , assault , taser , jail , and shoot Americans ( and their dogs ) as though the American populace will forever tolerate such abuses .
Police officers strut around cities and towns barking orders at people as though nothing in the world could ever take away their ability to intimidate and demean .
Similarly , politicians and police chiefs continue to defend their officers ’ actions , no matter how barbarically or blatantly they may have misbehaved .
In so doing , these police officers and politicians are demonstrating their inability or refusal to recognize how much America has changed .
Go Directly to Jail : T... Best Price : $ 2.55 Buy New $ 22.99 ( as of 07:50 EST - Details )
It is important for these police officers to quickly recognize that the United States is no longer populated primarily with happy , rich people unconcerned with the world outside their new houses and cars .
All of that was washed away in the explosion of the Federal Reserve ’s credit bubbles , beginning in 2007 .
Now , Americans have been finally forced to recognize that they are not even close to being as rich or as happy as they thought they were .
Many have lost their homes , and still more will lose their homes .
Many have lost their jobs , and still more will lose their jobs .
Many have found that their college educations are worthless , and still more will learn this lesson .
Many have lost a son or a brother or a husband in a pointless war , and still more will lose their husbands , fathers , and sons .
Many have lost their life savings , and so will many more .
In other words , a huge and growing number of Americans are homeless , jobless , fatherless , poor , and angry .
They have a lot less to lose than they did before .
These are not people amenable to being humiliated , bullied , assaulted , tasered , or shot .
Arrest - Proof Yourself : ...
Denham , Wes Best Price : $ 2.49 Buy New $ 23.80 ( as of 03:05 EST - Details )
Americans are not in the mood for this kind of s__t right now .
The effects of the actions of brazen and clueless police officers are compounded by the fact that there are not that many of them in the United States relative to the rest of the population .
There ’s a reason they are referred to as the thin blue line .
As such , they must recognize the revolutionary changes that have occurred over the past three years , and not provoke a group of people that far , far outnumbers them .
It was one thing for police officers to beat and shoot Americans when the vast majority of them were too distracted by their new houses and IKEA furniture to notice , but all of the distractions are now gone , and many of these people are angry and devoid of hope .
There must not be violence from " ordinary " Americans , who are , after all , armed , nor against them .
Police officers need to shed their arrogant self - assurance that the American people will always tolerate being humiliated , beaten , assaulted , tasered , or shot by a tiny group of people with badges .
There is a breaking point for all people , and it is foolish beyond belief to toy with that breakingpoint .
Police officers , stop courting disaster for America .
Join the civilized world where we do n’t humiliate , beat , assault , taser , and shoot other human beings .

( CNN ) --
The California Assembly on Thursday passed a bill appropriating $ 20 million to kidnapping victim Jaycee Dugard to settle her claims against the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , according to the chief clerk 's office .
The bill passed on a 30 - 1 vote in the Senate and a 62 - 0 vote in the Assembly , according to CNN affiliate KCRA .
Corrections officials entered into the settlement with Dugard , the station said .
Dugard vanished in 1991 at the age of 11 .
She was found in August 2009 , living in a shed in the Antioch , California , backyard of Phillip Garrido , a registered sex offender who had been on parole since January 1988 .
Investigators say Garrido fathered two children with Dugard during her captivity .
He and his wife , Nancy , are charged with 29 felony counts in the case .
Both have pleaded not guilty .
In a report issued in November , the state inspector general 's office found the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation failed to properly keep tabs on Garrido or properly supervise the officers assigned to his case .
" While it is true that Garrido 's California parole was never officially violated , our review shows that Garrido committed numerous parole violations and that the department failed to properly supervise Garrido and missed numerous opportunities to discover his victims , " the report said .
Parole officers failed to investigate utility wires running from Garrido's house toward the shed where Dugard was held , to check out the presence of a 12 - year - old girl during a visit or to act on information the report said " clearly " showed Garrido had violated the terms of his release , the report said .
Dugard , who is now 30 , her mother and her daughters had filed a claim saying state corrections officials failed to do their jobs , seeking psychological , physical and emotional damages , KCRA said .
The settlement process was " pretty much unprecedented , " said Jeff Long , spokesman for Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes , who sponsored the bill .
The language was inserted into a bill concerning claims against the state .
Fuentes is chairman of the Assembly 's Appropriations Committee , Long said .
Every year as part of the budget process , the chair submits two bills for judgments against the state , Long said .
It was decided that this would be the quickest way to get it through the Assembly , he said .
Officials thought the state might have a case if it fought Dugard 's claim , but it was n't worth the case going to a jury , Long said .
Because the constitutional deadline for an approved state budget has passed and California is in a new fiscal year without a budget , no appropriations can be made without Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's consent .
Schwarzenegger has to request the bill be moved to his desk to sign it , Long said .
Garrido was paroled in August 1988 after serving 11 years of a federal kidnapping sentence .
He also served a five - year term in Nevada for rape charges .
The November report from California Inspector - General David Shaw was limited to reviewing the actions of state parole officers in charge of monitoring Garrido from June 1999 until Dugard and her children were discovered .
But Garrido was under the supervision of federal parole officers when authorities say he kidnapped Dugard in 1991 , and they also " failed to detect Garrido 's criminal conduct and his victims , " the report says .
Garrido was only " properly supervised " for 12 out of the 123 months he was under California 's supervision , " a failure rate of about 90 percent , " Shaw told reporters in November .
CNN 's Ashley Hayes and Rachel Brown contributed to this report .

France 's lower house of parliament has overwhelmingly approved a ban on burka - like Islamic veils Tuesday , a move that is popular among French voters despite serious concerns from Muslim groups and human rights advocates .
There were 336 votes for the bill and just one against it at the National Assembly .
Most members of the main opposition group , the Socialist Party , refused to participate in the vote — though they support a ban , they have differences with President Nicolas Sarkozy 's conservatives over some aspects of it .
The ban on face - covering veils will go in September to the Senate , where it also is likely to pass .
Its biggest hurdle will likely come after that , when France 's constitutional watchdog scrutinizes it .
Some legal scholars say there is a chance it could be deemed unconstitutional .
The main body representing French Muslims says face - covering veils are not required by Islam and not suitable in France , but it worries that the law will stigmatize Muslims in general .
France has Europe 's largest Muslim population , estimated to be about five million of the country 's 64 million people .
While ordinary headscarves are common , only about 1,900 women in France are believed to wear face - covering veils .
Champions of the bill said the veils oppress women .
With the proposed ban , the government also is seeking to insist that integration is the only path for immigrant minorities .
France has had difficulty integrating generations of immigrants and their children , as witnessed by weeks of rioting by youths , many of them minorities , in troubled neighbourhoods in 2005 .
Chilly Toronto hopes to put out the Fire .
Toronto FC , by Mike Beauvais :
The 2 - 1 scoreline in last Saturday ’s loss to Real Salt Lake is flattering for Toronto FC .
The hosts could , and probably should , have won by a more convincing margin , but credit is due to the central defensive pairing of Adrian Cann and Nana Attakora .
The two Canadian internationals , along with goalkeeper Stefan Frei , were under siege , yet managed to keep things respectable , making clearance after clearance .
Chicago Fire , by Isaac Heath :
This is an easy one .
Baggio Husidic has been playing great soccer in the Chicago Fire midfield this season .
The Bosnian born Chicago resident has made the most of his playing opportunities this year , scoring a goal in each of his last two games .
Expect Husidic to continue to thrive in the five man midfield .
Toronto :
No one particular player was at fault on last weekend , but the match at Rio Tinto was a bit of a doomed enterprise from the get - go , largely due to Preki ’s overly conservative formation that ended up costing the team in the end .
With the Reds playing what was essentially a 4 - 5 - 1 and lone forward Chad Barrett stranded seemingly miles ahead of his teammates , RSL bossed the midfield with impunity .
What became obvious here was that TFC simply can’t afford to go without influential midfielders Dwayne De Rosario and Julian de Guzman for extended periods .
By the time the pair came on to start the second half , the Reds ’ fate was already sealed .
Chicago : Nobody on the Fire is playing glaringly badly , but their health seems to be a problem for the first time this year .
Last year the Fire experienced several crippling injuries throughout the season , but this roster does not seem deep enough to handle them like the 2009 team .
Justin Mapp and Collins John were injured last week joining the already sidelined John Thorrington and Logan Pause .
Toronto : Rest assured , barring the unforeseen , both De Rosario and de Guzman will be back in the TFC starting XI .
With this match being at BMO , the Reds will be playing to beat the Fire and Preki ’s formation will reflect that intent .
Look for the White - Barrett strikeforce to be handed another start at home against the William Conde-led Chicago defense , and for what is now the regular back line of Raivis Hscanovics , Attakora , Cann , and Maksim Usanov to deal with the ex-Cottager forward pairing of Brian McBride and Collins John .
Chicago :
The Fire has been playing with one striker up top and then the five midfielders are taking turns moving forward into the attack .
This strategy has been effective as defenses have been caught off guard by the creative runs of Marco Pappa , Husidic and Patrick Nyarko .
Toronto : Both TFC and the Fire have undergone radical changes under respective new managers Preki and Carlos de los Cobos and this will be the first meeting between the two clubs since the shifts in personnel and philosophy .
The team that is able to get through the feeling out process ( which could end up being lengthy and exacerbated by poor weather ) the quickest will most likely be the club poised for a result .
Chicago : Toronto FC boasts one of the best home field advantages in the MLS at snug BMO Field .
Thus far this year the Fire has played pretty well on the road , but it will be interesting to see how the respond to the atmosphere in Toronto .
Toronto : TFC ’s string of good home performances will continue , but so will the Fire ’s run of strong away form .
Take a 1 - 1 draw here .
Chicago : Expect a tight match with the two teams ending in a 2 - 2 draw .

Here ’s one habit restaurants embraced during the recession : grazing .
The number of menu items listed as snacks jumped 185 percent between 2007 and 2010 , and items described as mini soared almost 400 percent , according to new research from Mintel , a Chicago firm .
While McDonald ’s pushed its snack wraps , local chains like Au Bon Pain introduced a “ 19th hole snack mix ’’ and D’Angelo Sandwich Shop unveiled quesadilla snacks .
Meanwhile , Friendly ’s and Uno Chicago Grill added sliders , or miniburgers , to their menus .
Before the recession hit , restaurants had begun adding small meals as a way to drive traffic during off - peak hours and cater to consumers ’ on - the - go lifestyles .
But the economic downturn and sharp drop in consumer spending made snacks a centerpiece of menus .
Smaller portions meant downsized prices .
“ Snacks became more of a way for restaurants to attract consumers with low - priced food options , just to help sustain their business , ’’ said Eric Giandelone , director of foodservice research at Mintel .
“ Certainly , the popularity of the dollar menu bears just how price - sensitive restaurants have become . ’’
D’Angelo Sandwich
Shop realized last year it needed a cheap snack option after seeing rivals roll out dollar tacos and other value deals .
Using tortillas the shops already had in the stores for wraps , the Dedham chain created a quesadilla in three different varieties .
This limited - time offer was intended to last 12 weeks , but the huge popularity has made it a permanent item on the menu , according to Michael McManama , senior vice president of brand development for D’Angelo and its sister chain , Papa Gino’s .
The Number 9 Quesadilla ( a steak and cheese combination ) costs about $ 3 and is about half the size of the Number 9 sandwich for $ 6 .
“ It exceeded expectations by 25 percent , ’’ McManama said .
“ It ’s convenience , taste , and value . ’’
Julia Williams of Dorchester is one of the snack converts at D’Angelo .
Almost twice a week , she picks up the quesadillas for lunch , instead of a sandwich combination .
“ It ’s quick , good value , and cheaper than a sandwich , ’’ Williams said .
“ And it seems lighter and healthier than bread . ’’
Au Bon Pain , the Boston bakery chain , is currently testing a line of mini-pastries for $ 1.19 that are about half the size of its regular baked goods , including croissants and muffins that sell for $ 2.19 .
Last year , the company unveiled its 19th hole snack mix ( a combination of nuts , grains , and sesame crisps ) to expand its impulse offerings .
In 2008 , Au Bon Pain began its antisupersize movement with the launch of Portions , a line of small plates at 200 calories or under , such as a hummus and cucumber option and a mozzarella and tomato plate .
“ With the tough economy , people were downsizing their meals , ’’ said Ed Frechette , senior vice president of marketing for Au Bon Pain .
“ And people overall are grazing more .
People want to dabble a bit without making the commitment to a full - size option . ’’
While some consumers prefer snacking throughout the day to eating three sit - down meals , others purchase snacks as a way to eat smaller , healthier portions .
At McDonald ’s , Jody Cullinam seeks out the Chipotle BBQ snack wrap that features crispy chicken topped with chipotle BBQ sauce and wrapped in a flour tortilla .
“ It just seems better for you and lighter than a cheeseburger , ’’ Cullinam said .
( There ’s also a Big Mac snack wrap for meat lovers . )
In addition to expanding its snacking fare , McDonald ’s earlier this year unveiled a new a dollar breakfast menu to provide more value options , including a sausage biscuit and hash browns .
And this week , McDonald ’s rolled out its latest snack option — smoothies .
“ We try to offer everyday affordability , ’’ said Danya Proud , a McDonald ’s spokeswoman .
Retail analysts expect the snacking movement to continue to grow , even as the economy recovers .
And there is opportunity across all segments , from quick service to fine dining , to add innovation to menus with snacking options and boost sales , according to Giandelone , of Mintel .
“ With a stronger economy , there is often more disposable personal income that consumers can spend at restaurants not only for meal occasions but also for actual snacking , ’’ he said .

A ruling by the Supreme Court on June 21 is worrying civil liberties activists .
They say it appears to threaten rights of speech and association that had been considered firm since the failed prosecution of Communist Party members during the McCarthy era .
At stake was the interpretation by the Bush and Obama administrations of a 1996 law which authorizes the State Department to officially “ designate ” foreign organizations as terrorist entities , and the USA Patriot Act which criminalizes all material aid to such organizations , including providing them with vaguely defined “ services ” and “ expert advice . ”
The case is Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , and all its major documents can be read on the website of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
http://ccrjustice.org
The current State Department list of “ Foreign Terrorist Organizations ” ( FTOs ) can be read here .
http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm
“ Terrorism ” is defined in a vague and highly politicized manner .
For example , terrorists based in the United States who attack countries like Cuba are not covered .
The New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights , representing the Humanitarian Law Project and others , had challenged the “ services ” and “ expert advice ” aspect of the legislation as violating constitutional freedoms .
The plaintiffs had won in lower courts but the government appealed to the Supreme Court , where its position was argued by Solicitor - General Kagan , now nominated to the court by President Obama .
The plaintiffs had alleged that the phrasing of the USA Patriot Act on the issue of material aid to terrorists was unconstitutional because of the vagueness of the definition of “ material aid ” and because it presents a danger of violations of free speech and due process guarantees .
The definition of “ material aid ” could , for example , criminalize efforts by nongovernmental organizations to train groups like the Kurdish Workers ’
Party , PKK , to take their disputes with the Turkish government to the United Nations or other international bodies , thereby reducing or eliminating their reliance on violence .
Other real and hypothetical examples were given in the plaintiffs ’ briefs and in amicus curiae ( “ friend of the court ” ) briefs submitted by the ACLU , former President Jimmy Carter and others .
Carter has worked to bring about peaceful resolutions to conflicts in southern Lebanon .
The former president argued that achieving peaceful solutions to Lebanon ’s problems would be impossible without involving Hezbollah , a designated FTO .
According to the Supreme Court ’s decision , Carter could be prosecuted and face up to life imprisonment for doing this , in a worst - case scenario
The government argued that freedom of speech is not at risk because the law does not penalize independent advocacy in favor of groups like Hezbollah or PKK , only actions that coordinate with them in providing them with expert advice .
The court majority , however , said that what is at stake is indeed speech , but that it was legitimate to prohibit this kind of speech .
A big part of the case revolved around precedents set in the 1950s and 1960s by court rulings on efforts of the federal government to criminalize membership in the Communist Party USA .
In that era of Cold War and McCarthy hysteria , the government had waged a campaign claiming that the CPUSA had violent aims and was involved in illegal acts .
The federal courts nevertheless ruled that it was unconstitutional to prosecute individual Communists for mere membership in the party or for either advocacy or material support of the part of its program that the courts considered “ legal . ”
And to be convicted , a person would have to be shown to have consciously contributed to the ( mostly imaginary ) illegal aspect of the Party ’s activities .
At the time , this was seen as a major triumph for constitutional rights .
In this month ’s decision , Chief Justice John Roberts , in the majority opinion ( supported by Justices Alito , Thomas , Stevens , Kennedy and Scalia ) , ruled that even if U.S. persons thought their advice was helping to turn a designated foreign terrorist organization toward peaceful means of attaining its ends , that is , away from terrorism , this would be considered illegal under the statute because the foreign organization could be lying , or might change its mind later .
Further , the majority opinion argued that by steering terrorist groups away from violent methods , one would be “ legitimizing ” them and that would clash with legitimate U.S. foreign policy objectives .
Justice Breyer ’s dissent ( supported by Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg ) was particularly caustic :
“ What is one to say about these arguments – arguments that would deny First Amendment protection to the peaceful teaching of human rights law on the ground that a little knowledge about the “ international legal system ” is too dangerous a thing , that an opponent ’s subsequent willingness to negotiate might be faked , so let ’s not teach him how to try ? ”
The ruling remands the case back to the lower courts for reconsideration .
In reaction to the ruling , David Cole , cooperating attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights in the litigation , said , “ We are deeply disappointed .
The Supreme Court has ruled that human rights advocates , providing training and assistance in nonviolent resolution of disputes , can be prosecuted as terrorists .
In the name of fighting terrorism , the Court has said that the First Amendment permits Congress to make human rights advocacy and peacemaking a crime . ”
The OpenMP standard was formulated in 1997 as an API for writing portable , multi- threaded applications .
It started as a Fortran - based standard , but later grew to include C and C ++.
While the current version is OpenMP Version 3.0 , this article is based on OpenMP Version 2.5 , which supports Fortran , C , and C ++. Intel C++ and Fortran compilers support the OpenMP Version 2.5 standard .
The OpenMP programming model provides a platform - independent set of compiler pragmas , directives , function calls , and environment variables that explicitly instruct the compiler how and where to use parallelism in the application .
Many loops can be threaded by inserting only one pragma right before the loop , as demonstrated by examples in this article .
By leaving the nitty - gritty details to the compiler and OpenMP runtime library , you can spend more time determining which loops should be threaded and how to best restructure the algorithms for performance on multi-core processors .
The full potential of OpenMP is realized when it is used to thread the most time consuming loops , that is , the hot spots .
Tackling the topic of OpenMP in a single article is an intimidating task .
Therefore , this article serves as a bridge for you , allowing you to reach a point where you have a fundamental understanding of threading with OpenMP from which you can build your broader practical knowledge .
The power and simplicity of OpenMP can be demonstrated by looking at an example .
The following loop converts each 32 - bit RGB ( red , green , blue ) pixel in an array into an 8 - bit grayscale pixel .
The one pragma , which has been inserted immediately before the loop , is all that is needed for parallel execution under OpenMP .
# pragma omp parallel for for ( i = 0 ; i < numPixels ; i++) { pGrayScaleBitmap [i ] = ( unsigned BYTE ) ( pRGBBitmap [ i] .red * 0.299 + pRGBBitmap[ i ] .green * 0.587 + pRGBBitmap[i].blue * 0.114 ) ; }
Let 's take a closer look at the loop .
First , the example uses work - sharing , which is the general term that OpenMP uses to describe distributing work across threads .
When work - sharing is used with the for construct , as shown in this example , the iterations of the loop are distributed among multiple threads .
The OpenMP implementation determines how many threads to create and how best to manage them .
All the programmer needs to do is to tell OpenMP which loop should be threaded .
No need for programmers to add a lot of codes for creating , initializing , managing , and killing threads in order to exploit parallelism .
OpenMP compiler and runtime library take care of these and many other details behind the scenes .
In the current OpenMP specification Version 2.5 , OpenMP places the following five restrictions on which loops can be threaded :
The loop variable must be of type signed integer .
Unsigned integers will not work .
Note : this restriction is to be removed in the future OpenMP specification Version 3.0 .
The comparison operation must be in the form loop_variable < , <= , > , or >= loop_invariant_integer .
.
The third expression or increment portion of the for loop must be either integer addition or integer subtraction and by a loop invariant value .
If the comparison operation is < or <= , the loop variable must increment on every iteration ; conversely , if the comparison operation is > or >= , the loop variable must decrement on every iteration .
The loop must be a single entry and single exit loop , meaning no jumps from the inside of the loop to the outside or outside to the inside are permitted with the exception of the exit statement , which terminates the whole application .
If the statements goto or break are used , they must jump within the loop , not outside it .
The same goes for exception handling ; exceptions must be caught within the loop .
Although these restrictions may sound somewhat limiting , most loops can easily be rewritten to conform to them .
The restrictions listed above must be observed so that the compiler can parallelize loops via OpenMP .
However , even when the compiler parallelizes the loop , you must still ensure the loop is functionally correct by watching out for the issues in the next section .
Challenges in Threading a Loop
Threading a loop is to convert independent loop iterations to threads and run these threads in parallel .
In some sense , this is a re-ordering transformation in which the original order of loop iterations can be converted to into an undetermined order .
In addition , because the loop body is not an atomic operation , statements in the two different iterations may run simultaneously .
In theory , it is valid to convert a sequential loop to a threaded loop if the loop carries no dependence .
Therefore , the first challenge for you is to identify or restructure the hot loop to make sure that it has no loop - carried dependence before adding OpenMP pragmas .
Even if the loop meets all five loop criteria and the compiler threaded the loop , it may still not work correctly , given the existence of data dependencies that the compiler ignores due to the presence of OpenMP pragmas .
The theory of data dependence imposes two requirements that must be met for a statement S 2 and to be data dependent on statement S 1 .
There must exist a possible execution path such that statement S 1 and S 2 both reference the same memory location L .
and both reference the same memory location .
The execution of S 1 that references L occurs before the execution of S 2 that references L .
In order for S 2 to depend upon S 1 , it is necessary for some execution of S 1 to write to a memory location L that is later read by an execution of S 2 .
This is also called flow dependence .
Other dependencies exist when two statements write the same memory location L , called an output dependence , or a read occurs before a write , called an anti-dependence .
This pattern can occur in one of two ways :
S 1 can reference the memory location L on one iteration of a loop ; on a subsequent iteration S 2 can reference the same memory location L .
can reference the memory location on one iteration of a loop ; on a subsequent iteration can reference the same memory location .
S 1 and S 2 can reference the same memory location L on the same loop iteration , but with S 1 preceding S 2 during execution of the loop iteration .
The first case is an example of loop - carried dependence , since the dependence exists when the loop is iterated .
The second case is an example of loop - independent dependence ; the dependence exists because of the position of the code within the loops .
Table 1 shows three cases of loop - carried dependencies with dependence distance d , where 1 ≤ d ≤ n , and n is the loop upper bound .
Table 1 : The Different Cases of Loop - carried dependencies .
Let 's take a look at the following example where d = 1 and n = 99 .
The write operation is to location x[k ] at iteration k in S 1 , and a read from it at iteration k+1 in S 2 , thus a loop - carried flow dependence occurs .
Furthermore , with the read from location y[ k –1 ] at iteration k in S 1 , a write to it is performed at iteration k+1 in S 2 , hence , the loop - carried antidependence exists .
In this case , if a parallel for pragma is inserted for threading this loop , you will get a wrong result .
// Do NOT do this .
It will fail due to loop - carried // dependencies . x [ 0 ] = 0 ; y[ 0 ] = 1 ; # pragma omp parallel for private( k ) for ( k = 1 ; k < 100 ; k++ ) { x[ k ] = y[ k - 1 ] + 1 ; // S1 y[ k ] = x [ k - 1 ] + 2 ; // S2 }
Because OpenMP directives are commands to the compiler , the compiler will thread this loop .
However , the threaded code will fail because of loop - carried dependence .
The only way to fix this kind of problem is to rewrite the loop or to pick a different algorithm that does not contain the loop - carried dependence .
With this example , you can first predetermine the initial value of x [ 49 ] and y [ 49 ] ; then , you can apply the loop strip mining technique to create a loop - carried dependence - free loop m .
Finally , you can insert the parallel for to parallelize the loop m .
By applying this transformation , the original loop can be executed by two threads on a dual - core processor system .
// Effective threading of the loop using strip - mining // transformation . x [ 0 ] = 0 ; y[ 0 ] = 1 ; x [ 49 ] = 74 ; //derived from the equation x ( k ) =x ( k - 2) +3 y [ 49 ] =
74 ; //derived from the equation y( k ) =y ( k - 2 ) +3 # pragma omp parallel for private ( m , k ) for ( m=0 , m < 2 ; m++ ) { for ( k = m *49+1 ; k < m *50+50 ; k++ ) { x[ k ] = y[ k - 1 ] + 1 ; // S1 y[ k ] = x [ k - 1 ] + 2 ; // S2 } }
Besides using the parallel for pragma , for the same example , you can also use the parallel sections pragma to parallelize the original loop that has loop - carried dependence for a dual - core processor system .
// Effective threading of a loop using parallel sections # pragma omp parallel sections private ( k ) { { x [ 0 ] = 0 ; y[ 0 ] = 1 ; for ( k = 1 ; k < 49 ; k++ ) { x[ k ] = y[ k - 1 ] + 1 ; // S1 y[ k ] = x [ k - 1 ] + 2 ; // S2 } } # pragma omp section { x [ 49 ] = 74 ; y[ 49 ] = 74 ; for ( k = 50 ; k < 100 ; k++ ) { x[ k ] = y[ k - 1 ] + 1 ; // S3 y[ k ] = x [ k - 1 ] + 2 ; // S4 } } }
With this simple example , you can learn several effective methods from the process of parallelizing a loop with loop - carried dependencies .
Sometimes , a simple code restructure or transformation is necessary to get your code threaded for taking advantage of dual - core and multi-core processors besides simply adding OpenMP pragmas .
A dandy or form of address
Dude is American English slang for an individual , typically male .
[ 1 ]
From the 1870s to the 1960s , dude primarily meant a person who dressed in an extremely fashionable manner ( a dandy ) or a conspicuous citified person who was visiting a rural location , a " city slicker " .
In the 1960s , dude evolved to mean any male person , a meaning that slipped into mainstream American slang in the 1970s .
Current slang retains at least some use of all three of these common meanings . [ 2 ]
History
The term " dude " may also have derived from the 18th - century word " doodle " , as in " Yankee Doodle Dandy " . [ 5 ]
In the popular press of the 1880s and 1890s , " dude " was a new word for " dandy " — an " extremely well - dressed male " , a man who paid particular importance to how he appeared .
The café society and Bright Young Things of the late 1800s and early 1900s were populated with dudes .
Young men of leisure vied to show off their wardrobes .
The best known of this type is probably Evander Berry Wall , who was dubbed " King of the Dudes " in 1880s New York and maintained a reputation for sartorial splendor all his life .
This version of the word is still in occasional use in American slang , as in the phrase " all duded up " for getting dressed in fancy clothes . [ 6 ]
Chicago Tribune , 25 February 1883
Among the very first published descriptions defining " dude " ; , 25 February 1883
The word was used to refer to Easterners and referred to a man with " store - bought clothes " .
[ 7 ]
The word was used by cowboys to unfavorably refer to the city dwellers . [ 8 ]
A variation of this was a " well - dressed man who is unfamiliar with life outside a large city " .
In The Home and Farm Manual ( 1883 ) , author Jonathan Periam used the term " dude " several times to denote an ill - bred and ignorant , but ostentatious , man from the city .[ citation needed ]
The implication of an individual who is unfamiliar with the demands of life outside of urban settings gave rise to the definition of dude as a " city slicker " , or " an Easterner in the [ United States ] West " .
[ 1 ]
Thus " dude " was used to describe the wealthy men of the expansion of the United States during the 19th century by ranch - and - homestead - bound settlers of the American Old West .
This use is reflected in the dude ranch , a guest ranch catering to urbanites seeking more rural experiences .
Dude ranches began to appear in the American West in the early 20th century , for wealthy Easterners who came to experience the " cowboy life " .
The implicit contrast is with those persons accustomed to a given frontier , agricultural , mining , or other rural setting .
This usage of " dude " was still in use in the 1950s in America , as a word for a tourist — of either gender — who attempts to dress like the local culture but fails . [ 9 ]
An inverse of these uses of " dude " would be the term " redneck , " a contemporary American colloquialism referring to poor farmers and uneducated persons , which itself became pejorative , and is also still in use . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
As the word gained popularity and reached the coasts of the U.S. and traveled between borders , variations of the slang began to pop up such as the female versions of dudette and dudines ; however , they were short lived due to dude also gaining a neutral gender connotation and some linguists see the female versions as more artificial slang .
The slang eventually had gradual decline in usage until the early to mid 20th century when other subcultures of the U.S. began using it more frequently while again deriving it from the type of dress and eventually using it as a descriptor for common male and sometimes female companions .
Eventually , lower class schools with a greater mix of subcultures allowed the word to spread to almost all cultures and eventually up the class ladders to become common use in the U.S .
By the late 20th to early 21st century , dude had gained the ability to be used in the form of expression , whether that be disappointment , excitement , or loving and it also widened to be able to refer to any general person no matter race , gender , or culture . [ 13 ]
The term was also used as a " job description " , such as " bush hook dude " as a position on a railroad in the 1880s .
For an example , see the Stampede Tunnel.[ citation needed ]
In the early 1960s , dude became prominent in surfer culture as a synonym of guy or fella .
The female equivalent was " dudette " or " dudess " .
but these have both fallen into disuse and " dude " is now also used as a unisex term .
This more general meaning of " dude " started creeping into the mainstream in the mid-1970s .
" Dude " , particularly in surfer and " bro " culture , [ citation needed ] is [ when ? ] generally used informally to address someone ( " Dude , I 'm glad you finally called " ) or refer to another person ( " I 've seen that dude around here before " ) . [ 14 ]
One of the first known references to the word in American film was in the 1969 movie Easy Rider where Wyatt ( portrayed by Peter Fonda ) explains to his cellmate lawyer ( portrayed by Jack Nicholson ) the definition of " dude " : " Dude means nice guy ; Dude means regular sort of person . "
The usage of the word to mean a " cool person " was further popularized in American films of the 1980s and 1990s such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Fast Times at Ridgemont High , Bill and Ted 's Excellent Adventure , Wayne 's World , and Clerks . [ 15 ]
The 1998 film The Big Lebowski featured Jeff Bridges as " The Dude " , described as a " lazy deadbeat " .
The character was largely inspired by activist and producer Jeff Dowd who has been called " Dude " since childhood . [ 16 ]
The film 's central character inspired the creation of Dudeism , a neoreligion . [ 17 ]
The 2000 film Dude , Where 's My Car ?
uses the word in the title .
In 2008 , Bud Light aired an advertising campaign in which the dialogue consists entirely of different inflections of " Dude ! " and does not mention the product by name .
It was a followup to their near - identical and more widely noted " Whassup ? " campaign . [ 18 ] [ 15 ]
On 23 July 2019 Boris Johnson popularized the word " dude " as an acronym for his Conservative Party leadership campaign .
In his leadership speech he explained it as referring to Deliver Brexit – Unite the country – Defeat Jeremy Corbyn – Energize the country . [ 19 ]

Fresh news today in the case of Bradley Manning , the US soldier suspected of leaking classified military material - including video of a controversial attack - helicopter strike in which Iraqi civilians including children were hit - to Wikileaks .
According to a statement issued by the 1st Armored Division public - affairs staff in Baghdad , Manning was formally charged yesterday with committing two offences under the US Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) between November 2009 and May 2010 .
The first charge comes under UCMJ article 92 .
Military prosecutors allege that Manning , employed as an intelligence specialist at Contingency Operating Base Hammer in Iraq , violated a lawful Army regulation in that he transferred classified data onto his personal computer and added unauthorised software to a classified computer system .
The second UCMJ charge is under article 134 , that Manning allegedly committed various further offences under the ordinary US criminal code .
These offences included " communicating , transmitting and delivering national defense information to an unauthorized source " ; " disclosing classified information concerning the national defense with reason to believe that the information could cause injury to the United States " and " exceeding authorized computer access to obtain classified information " .
US commanders in Iraq will now convene a UCMJ Article 32 hearing , similar to one by a US grand jury .
The investigating officer in charge will make a recommendation to Manning 's chain of command whether or not to refer the case for trial by court - martial .
Manning was arrested by US military police in May , reportedly following a tip - off from a former hacker named Adrian Lamo whom he had contacted on the internet .
Manning was thought to be the source of video taken during an attack by US attack helicopters above Baghdad in 2007 , which saw Reuters journalists killed and other unarmed civilians - including two children - struck .
The Pentagon subsequently concluded that the helicopter crews had acted within their rules of engagement , noting that US ground troops had just come under heavy attack nearby and that armed men were among those hit .
According to Lamo 's account , Manning did not confine his activities to the 2007 helicopter strike .
Lamo said the soldier was " basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as he could , and just throwing it up into the air " .
It has been speculated that Wikileaks may be in possession of more material supplied by Manning which has not yet been released . ®
Almost immediately after Jonathan Toews hoisted the Stanley Cup for the Chicago Blackhawks the vultures descended upon the team and began to pillage the champs .
Chicago ’s cap crunch was well documented and every team with a competent GM knew there were players to be had on the cheap .
The Hawks have already traded Dustin Byfuglien , Ben Eager , Brent Sopel , Andrew Ladd , and Kris Versteeg from their championship roster and almost lost RFA Niklas Hjalmarsson to the San Jose Sharks .
Plus , John Madden , who is a UFA , wo n’t be re-signed .
Additionally , Antti Niemi is going to arbitration and will certainly receive a large raise from the $ 800,000 he made last year .
If the contract he ’s awarded is too large it is entirely possible that the Hawks will walk away from the decision and attempt to sign another goalie for a cheaper salary .
Even after the Hawks bury Christobal Huet ’s $ 5.625 million in the minors they will have a very small amount of money to fill out at least 5 roster spots .
According to Tim Sassone of Chicago ’s Daily Herald , the Hawks have 15 players under contract for $ 59.3 million ( including Stanley Cup bonuses ) , while the cap limit is $ 59.4 million .
Without Huet , Chicago 's cap space is n’t even $ 6 million .
The Hawks will still be one of the best teams in the league next year because they have Kane , Toews , Hossa , Sharp , Bolland , Keith , Seabrook , and Campbell , but they will find it very hard to repeat as Stanley Cup Champions because they lack the tremendous depth that made them so successful last season .
It ’s also entirely possible that the Hawks will have to trade another player like Sharp to get under the cap , so I do n’t see them repeating .
With the Hawks set to slip from their lofty perch it seems the Western Conference will send a completely different team to the Stanley Cup Final .
It wo n’t be San Jose because even though they ’ll be good , they ’ll still be San Jose .
The best team in the Western Conference , and likely the entire NHL , will be the most overrated team of the past two seasons - a team which is now probably underrated due to two straight second round beat - downs .
Yes , Vancouver fans , this is an article giving you the respect that you all so desperately crave ( Vancouver fans are like that attractive girlfriend who asks if she ’s fat so often you start to believe she really is ) .
The first smart move the Canucks made this off - season was letting Pavol Demitra walk .
When the Canucks first signed Demitra I thought it reeked of desperation .
Signing Demitra for $ 4 million a year would have been great in 2000 – but not in 2008 .
Aside from being injured for most of his stay in Vancouver , Demitra was largely invisible .
This is n’t surprising considering he has n’t been very good since he was on St. Louis – which was before the lockout .
Luckily both Kesler and Burrows emerged as quality top - six forwards ( okay , I still think Burrows is fake ) otherwise the Canucks would lack any secondary scoring behind the Sedins .
With the money the Canucks saved by burying Pavol Demitra ’s rotting carcass they addressed their blueline , which is seemingly plagued by injuries every season .
They traded for Keith Ballard ( unfortunately known as the guy who threw a puck in his own net and also tried to tomahawk chop Tomas Vokoun ’s head off ) and signed Dan Hamhuis .
Both are good two - way defencemen who will be an upgrade on the blueline .
I ’m not a huge fan of letting Willie Mitchell leave , considering he was their best shut - down defenceman , but his age and concussion history leave his playing career in question .
The Canucks do n’t have a true number one defenceman , but seem comfortable playing a defence by committee system .
I have no beef with that .
At this point the Canucks will likely trade a defenceman , since they have seven or eight players capable of playing in the top-six and they are close to the cap limit .
They could use another forward , so if they can parlay someone like Kevin Bieksa into a top - six player then they could become even more formidable next season .
However , you know Sami Salo is going to miss 15 - 30 games , so having an extra defenceman is n’t the worst thing for the Canucks .
Barring any trade , the main forwards for the Canucks remain the same as they were last season .
However , the Canucks could find an internal upgrade for the departed ( Demitra , Wellwood ) .
Cody Hodgson has done everything there is to do in junior hockey and is likely to make the Canucks out of training camp .
He was pencilled into the line - up before last season started , but a poor performance in camp and a back injury forced the Canucks to slow his ascension .
Hodgson is the third ranked prospect in all of hockey according to Hockey ’s Future and was the CHL Player of the Year in 2009 .
He ’s 20 - years - old and has all the makings of an excellent two - way forward .
If Hodgson makes the team the Canucks will have Henrik Sedin , Ryan Kesler , and Hodgson as their top - three centres .
That ’s really , really good .
Hodgson could be joined by Jordan Schroeder and maybe even Sergei Shirokov ( super Russian name ) .
Schroeder was the top collegiate player in the 2009 draft and was selected 22nd overall .
He too has the makings of a good two - way centre , despite being undersized .
He led the US in scoring at the 2009 World Junior Hockey Championship and was assigned to the Manitoba Moose of the AHL after the end of the 2010 college season .
He scored 9 points in 11 regular season games for the Moose and added six points in six games during the playoffs .
I ’m not going to lie , I know nothing about Sergei Shirokov , but his super Russian name has me intrigued .
That ’s why I said maybe he will make the team ( maybe he will !
Just do n’t take my word for it ) .
After a super quick stats master I discovered that S.S. was the second leading scorer for the Moose with 45 points in 76 as a rookie .
If these young players , in addition to Mason Raymond , are able to provide the Canucks with the type of depth that the Hawks received from young players like Bolland , Versteeg , and Byfuglien , then they will be the best team in the entire league .
But the youthful insurgence in Vancouver is n’t just up front .
The Canucks let Andrew Raycroft sign elsewhere because Cory Schneider seems ready to become a NHL goalie .
He ’ll backup Roberto Luongo , but should receive a fair amount of playing time .
Luongo tired in the playoffs the two previous seasons , which suggests he could benefit from a reduced workload during the regular season .
If Schneider can provide the Canucks with 20 - 25 quality games they will go into the playoffs in better shape .
( Yes , I know Raycroft played 21 games last year , but that was mainly due to injuries to Luongo who also played heavy minutes in the Olympics ) .
The Canucks had a great off - season , which is also what Kyle Wellwood has every summer as he drinks beer and hangs out at his cottage .
However , Vancouver did not have a mistake free off - season .
Signing Manny Malhotra to a three - year deal worth $ 2.5 million per season with a NTC seems excessive , but Malholtra may just provide the Canucks with the grit they ’ve always lacked come playoff time .
At this point , last season ’s second highest scoring team is riding themselves of dead weight up front , while adding potential breakout young players .
They also bolster their defence , which was the 12th best in the league last season .
These are the additions to a team which already boasts last season 's MVP and one of the premier two - way centres in the league ( talking about Kesler ) .
I ’d say this team is ready to take a leap forward next season .
They ’ve had two bitter playoff loses in a row to Chicago which should motivate everyone heading into next season .
This is a team that should carry a chip on their shoulder and play with an edge all year - long .
I think even if the LA Kings sign Ilya Kovalchuck and trade for Tomas Kaberle they still wo n’t be the team to beat in the Western Conference .
They ’ll be close , but I ’d still give the ( super ) early edge to Vancouver .
Maybe I 'll do a post talking up the Kings when they sign Kovalchuck .
Look for it early 2045 .

NOTE : This story has been revealed to be a complete hoax .
Complete details can be found here .
Important update , 7/6/2010 : Despite three sources providing some corroborating details , the veracity of this story has been called into question .
Sources in the U.S. and Uganda now tell me that the young man in question was not connected with Integrity Uganda , and that Bishop Christopher Senyonjo did not make the statement attributed to him by Changing Attitudes .
I am still looking for more information and will provide updates as soon as I have them .
Update @ 14:45 PST : More fingerprints of a hoax are emerging .
The Rev. Erich Kasirye , identified as the “ General Secretary , Integrity Uganda ” and who gave an extensive quotation that I reproduced below , appears to have been involved with a few money - raising scams through his connection with Integrity Uganda in 2004 .
He also absconded with the Kitemu Community Center , which had been built using funds from Integrity USA , by turning it over to the Anglican Church of Uganda while renouncing his connections with Integrity Uganda to church officials .
Integrity USA and Integrity Uganda severed ties with Kasirye at that time .
More information here .
…
A reader tipped me to this horrible news .
The severed head of a volunteer for Integrity Uganda , the pro-LGBT organization founded by Bishop Christopher Senyonjo , was found in a pit latrine on a farm in Makindye Sabagabo , Wakiso District .
Judith Nabakooba , a police spokesperson , identified the head as that of Pasikali Kashusbe , one of the workers on Kigggundu ’s farm and a member of Integrity Uganda .
Pasikali and his partner
Abbey are youth workers with Integrity Uganda charged with the responsibility of mobilising young LGBT people in activities which build community capacity to face up to the challenge of homophobia , especially in the area of attitude change and care through drama and sports activities .
According to the police , a mutilated torso which was earlier in the week discovered in Kabuuma Zone , about half a kilometre away from Kiggundu ’s farm was probably Pasikali ’s
The torso was described as belonging to a young man and had no genitals .
Pasikali went missing over three and half weeks ago when the country was celebrating Uganda Martyrs Day .
All efforts by his partner Abbey and other family members to find him had been fruitless .
Bishop Christopher Senyonjo , Chairperson of Integrity Uganda lamented the murder of this young man as ‘ absurd ’ adding that , ‘ clearly , the values of tolerance and social inclusion are sadly being sacrificed on the altar of state ignorance , ineptness and good old colonial stupidity ’ .
Uganda ’s Martyr ’s Day , a national holiday , is a particularly dangerous time for LGBT people .
The holiday commemorates the death of several Anglican and Catholic missionaries converts ordered by the Bugandan King Mwanga II , who felt that foreign religious influences posed a threat to his kingdom .
In fact , his fears proved correct ; the executions prompted Britain to invade Uganda and turn it into a British colony .
Popular lore has it that King Mwanga II , who himself was a teenager , killed the martyrs because they refused his homosexual advances .
While that belief is widespread , this particular allegation is typically not found in more reputable hagiographies .
It is unclear how much of that part of the story is true or how much of it is lore that was reinforced by the British colonial government to discredit the king .
The farm where Kashusbe ’s head was found is reportedly owned by Badru Kiggundu , who is the chairman of Uganda ’s Electoral Commission .
Police found the head while searching for a missing priest , Rev Henry Kayizzi Nsubuga , who disappeared almost two and half weeks ago after delivering a speech at St. Paul ’s Church in Kanyanya supporting homosexuality in Uganda .
The independent television network NTV Uganda posted this video three days ago , but does n’t mention the circumstances which appear to have led to Pasikali ’s murder :
Daily Monitor , Uganda ’s largest newspapers , has a few more sparse details here .
In this report , the victim is identified as Paschal Kashushu .
Amid conflicting reports , it appears that at at least one man has been arrested , possibly a relative .
I ’m trying to get more information directly from Uganda .
Changing Attitudes has this statement from Rev Erich Kasirye , General Secretary , Integrity Uganda :
Pasikali and his partner Abbey joined Integrity Uganda in June 2007 and during the last three years , Integrity Uganda has seen an increase in coordination and harmonisation of youth activities .
Pasikali emphasized the promotion of the concept of care across the continuum through the formation of voluntary home care groups for young LGBTIs who continue to live in fear .
He will be greatly missed by the entire LGBTI fraternity .
As for the missing priest , the only direct news reports that I can find about him appear in the government - owned New Vision .
There is no mention of Rev. Nsubuga ’s sermon .
Instead , it appears that relatives are painting the missing priest as mentally “ stressed . ”
A report by a reporter from Kamulali Newspaper and re-published on the virulently anti-gay web site Virtue Online provides more hints about the possible link between Rev. Nsubuga ’s disappearance and his pro-gay sermon .
U.S. Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - Lakewood ) ignited a heated debate when she suggested that Arizona 's crackdown on illegal immigration was fueled by white supremacists .
Sanchez criticized the crackdown in a speech before a Democratic group this week .

I can't see how continuing to squander money on hopeless appeals is going to do

Cahn is clearly not working for the benefit of
creditors which leaves a big question as to what is he actually doing other than

SCO is going to need money going forward .
They are going to get it one way or another ,
by hook or by crook .
Perhaps
Cahn should begin to take seriously some of
the money making opportunities that have been presented .
I still think non-exclusive non-transferable source
licenses can generate substantial income for now .
It also needs to be acted upon before all the bits
and know - how are gone .
I also think Cahn could auction off rights to the
unredacted versions of various redacted and / or sealed
court documents .
These would be presented once all
possible appeals are lost , and SCO is to be dissolved .
Should SCO win , they can simply refund the winning
bids , and keep those documents .
I would guess there
would be interest from a number of parties or people
in such documents .
It would likely fetch the most
if the eventual access were auctioned off on each
document separately rather than all together .
( Of course I would want Cahn 's neck to personally
be on the line if for any reason the documents cannot
be delivered when the time comes )

Realize that Cahn , Fatell , Gross , Yarro , and all their cronies know that SCOG is
practically worthless and the only thing SCOG is good for is as a litigation
lottery fund .
They 're not interested in reviving SCOG as a going concern .
All the feigned
outrage was and is just a stage play for the gullible .
In reality , the SCOG
band of merry men are feeling roundly humiliated and dejected and have no desire
to face the world as a software company .
They 're too proud .
You probably know
how it is when : you make a dumb move and instead of a " mea culpa , " you
try to save face ; but every additional move you make keeps burying you further
and further .
And when the humiliation you were trying so desperately to avoid
finally catches up with you , it hits you with a force many times greater than it
otherwise would have .

If I understand the process right , this is what happens
next :
1 . The case gets appointed a panel of three judges on the
10th circuit CoA .
2. SCO submits briefs detailing their appeal
3 . Novell submits a reply brief
4. SCO submits a reply to their reply
5 . The Judges hold oral arguments
6 . The Judges issue an opinion .
If , as we exect , the judges decide to sustain the district
courts rulings , then SCO can appeal to the 10th Circuit
< i>en banc < /i > , but unlike this appeal , the 10th Circuit can
decline to hear it .
Similarly if SCO chooses to appeal to
the SCOTUS .
Hmmm , Novell currently has an outstanding petition to SCOTUS
regarding whether or not copyright transfer has to be
explicit .
With the ruling as it stands , their petition is
moot , but with the appeal , it 's still live .
So if SCO won
their appeal and got another trial , they could still lose
the existing appeal , pulling the rug out from under the 2nd
trial ...

Oh ! -- Early .
This was expected early next week on deadline with far more suspense .
That SCO is so contrarian !
They took the thrill out of it .
That has saved a few clicks .
It 's a good time to sort things out .
This keeps alive the Writ of Cert before the SCOTUS .
As long as that is alive , it can moot anything that happens in the last trial and appeal .
Given that this whole jury retrial experience corroborates what Judge Kimball originally did , the parties and Justices will have a hard time ignoring it as they will officially have to .
In their Notice of Appeal they include basically everything .
This is a precaution .
They may not appeal everything in their brief .
Why not appeal ?
They did so well their first time before the Tenth Circuit .
The Circuit bent over backwards to help them .
Even a murderer asks for probation .
If you do n't ask , you shall not receive .
Maybe McConnell will cartwheel back by special designation .
They will pray for their wildest dreams and hope for the Circuit 's best .
The Tenth have guaranteed jobs .
A little awkward scrutiny never scared them .
The SCOnks are surrealists .
The question now is will Novell cross-appeal everything .
They should given the way Judge Ted Stewart slammed the door on any reconsiderations consistent with the Tenth Circuits decision but not appealed by Novell .
Remember one can not appeal anything that was not requested or objected to at trial .
So the appeal is just repeating the pleadings of the trial after checking them for updates .
Novell actually has far more to appeal than SCO .
Another question is why Cahn , the Trustee of nothing , is bothering to appeal .
Is there bargaining still going on ?
He must be guaranteed further expenses by an interested fairy because he is not going to pay out of his own pocket and SCO 's pocket is running out .
He could also fold before the brief is due with little damage .
He is not using his judgment as to the merits of SCO 's case .
He says what he has to in court .
After Chapter 7 there is Chapter IC from the Twilight Zone .
He is doing someone 's bidding .
This is why a bankruptible company was used in the first place .
The FUDmongers will not die .
Is this scorched earth for spite ?
Guarantees and threats have been made .
The message they are sending is do not dare to resist them .
It will cost you either way .
Dominance takes vigilance .
SCO and BSF are merely their tools .
A nearly omnipotent power does not see little setbacks in the little legal arenas of one country as anything other than the next step .
The Judgment stands stronger after a jury and two bench trials .
The first SCO appeal is negated .
This greatly enhances the amusement value .

Could n't $ 455 be better spent on things like paying off the poor pizza delivery guy that got stiffed when SCO declared bankruptcy , along with the bill they left unpaid at the local mom & pop run office supply store ?
What I am saying is there must be many good and decent citizen that have to do without something because all these high - powered lawyers want to play their lofty games in their ivory towers .

SCO now has some more time to actually file their appeal .
Does this filing do anything more than simply give them a little more time ?
If I were Cahn I would have BSF preparing an appeal ( for free ) and have Blank
Rome negotiating with Novell ( and possibly IBM ) to tie up loose ends .
His most powerful negotiating weapon at this point is the cost of continuing
this case .

Actually I guess I 'm not surprised ( due to it being NewSCO ) but just appalled
that this travesty of justice is allowed to go on and on .
SCO have had fair trials , fair appeals and have been allowed to drag this on for
a ridiculous amount of time .
If this had been < some other company > vs
Microsoft or Oracle or Cisco etc then it would have been over years ago .
Proprietary vs Open Source politics is definitely in the background somewhere
gumming up the works ( my own opinion by the way ) .
I have my own ( tiny ) company and if I failed in a case ( in the UK ) - it would be
over ( perhaps after one appeal ) .
Not dragging on and on ad infinitum .
The legal system has been as fair as possible to NewSCO - they have failed ( as
they should have done ) and now they must pay the price .
This appeal is ( IMHO )
just their way ( yet again ) of delaying the inevitable .

Appealing clearly gives him some leverage to negotiate with Novell .
Novell can contemplate the cost and expense of another trial , from which they have nothing to gain but everything to lose .
What a position they are in !
SCO has the full weight of the bankruptcy court behind them as they continue to harass Novell with a frivolous suite .
This is terribly unjust .
I can imagine Cahn like a cold - blooded chess player .
Queen to rook four - and he sits back and contemplates his move , savoring the new position .
Only , something is missing here , and what is missing is any sense of right or wrong .
Ethics , morals - there are none involved for Cahn .
He has his chess pieces to move around the board - the paid up contract with Boise Schiller , full immunity from any consequences .
Novell has been forced into a duel in which they have nothing to gain and everything to lose .
It was even worse for them in the trail in front of Judge Steward , where they were forced to fight with their hands tied behind their backs .
Even so they won - but won what ?
They only won the prospect of having to face yet another appeal .
What has Novell ever done to deserve such abuse from the legal system for which they pay taxes to support ?
Many years ago there was this television series called " V " .
It put forth the proposition that there are aliens living among us disguised as human beings .
Only we could see that the aliens were actually lizards when there was nobody watching .
There was this one scene where an alien , disguised as a judge , retired to his chambers for a little snack .
At this point we did n't know for sure that he was an alien .
In his office he had a terrarium with a couple of " pet " rats living in it .
He picked up one by the tail , contemplated it for a moment , then suddenly opened his mouth much wider than any human could and swallowed it whole .
We knew then beyond any doubt that he was an alien .
Similarly , we see Judge Cahn opening his moulth wide to swallow Novell .
Judge Gross was never compelled to permit SCO to embark on this path in the first place .
There was a point way back when Novell explained SCO 's game to the judge , calling it a " litigation lottery " .
It was clearly a difficult decision for Judge Gross , which he resolved by calling for a retired judge to oversee SCO in Chapter 11 .
Many of us had expectations that that might not have been such a bad idea , as we had hopes that such a person would quickly see through SCO 's game and put an end to it .
Personally , I had even greater expectations , like he would immediately do a full audit of the books and investigate former management .
I think I can understand Judge Gross .
Imagine you are the judge , and furthermore you are a bit intellectually challenged , but with a strong sense of fairness and justice .
Though Novell has clearly explained to you why SCO should be sent to Chapter 7 , you can't really grasp the plain language of the APA .
Being a bit slow , and easily manipulated by a bunch of slickers , you consider what would happen if there was actual merit in SCO 's position .
Why then , it would be a travesty of justice to force them into Chapter 7 , would n't it ?
So you do what Judge Gross did - get a legal expert to act as trustee and get to the bottom of this .
Now I spoke kindly of Judge Gross , suggesting that this all began out of his sense of fairness .
He could just as easily have denied SCO continued existence , and he can deny it now .
The scales of justice are so out of balance now against Novell , that it defies logic .
Novel will speak once more to Judge Gross , and I am convinced that if they get no sympathy from him they will appeal his decisions to a higher court .

This is also NOT the Chapter 11 Trustee .
This is Ralph moving his sock puppet .
Ralph has that ' loan ' he made to NewSCO .
NewSCO can't pay back the ' loan ' .
NewSCO probably wo n't make payroll shortly ( like this month ? ) .
Under the terms of the ' loan ' , Ralph has control of the litigation , so this has
to be Ralph 's decision .
This opens two questions :
a . When the litigation officially moves to Ralph 's " Sock Puppet II " ,
has he actually scraped off all the adverse litigation ( IBM counterclaims , Red
Hat , etc. ) ?
b. Ralph was a director of NewSCO , a stockholder .
Normally he would
nevertheless be insulated from liability for NewSCO actions ( the corporate veil
thingy ) .
Will so blatently taking over the litigation give the Nazgul a pretext
to move directly against Ralph ?
Which Ralph would have to defend against with
his own money .
Bonus Question :
Does the transfer of the litigation to Sock Puppet II give BSF a
pretext to get out from under ?
Maybe not , but forcing Ralph to litigate the
continuation of the litigation ( again on his dime ) might give BSF the leverage
to make Ralph go away ( eventually ) .

Your headline states that SCO Appeals
This really can't be right
When just the word brings screams and squeals
They are n't a pleasant sight
There is no way that SCO Appeals
To either me or you
The merest glance at them reveals
An unappealing view
I hope the court for these Appeals
Do n't read your headline wrong
But recognise the dodgy deals
That SCO did all along
Is there an end to these Appeals
That 's my appeal today
Or do they go on till MacBride steals
What 's all of our 's today !

How much time does SCO have to present their arguments ?
In
Germany , you typically have a 2 weeks deadline to file an
appeal and another 2 weeks to file your arguments ( the latter
accumulating with the former to a full 4 weeks ) .
How long in
the US ?

Although filing an appeal at this point looks like a strange brew of nerve and
stupidity to me , is there any chance that this is also just SOP ?
In the
dealings that I have had a legal defeat ( patents ) , the attorneys used every
chance at an appeal as standard procedure .
Completely irrelevant to SCO tangent ... we were on our last appeal for a product
where the examiner just did not get the novelty .
The chemicals were described
were in prior art , but not the way they were combined .
Anyone skilled in the
art would have predicted a solid , based on a read through the recipes .
We
combined them to make a liquid that we could pump , pour , and meter .
I took some
material with me to the examiner 's office for that meeting when we were a hair 's
breadth from a final rejection .
When he saw the liquid , his eyes got wide , and
he approved our patent .
Again , that tangent has no reference to SCO ; we actually had a reason to appeal
beyond filing one just because we could .

OK .
Here is the challenge .
On what legal basis could SCO possibly challenge and
be granted an appeal ?
And remember , " I Lost " is not a winning argument
to qualify for an appeal ...
Or am I wrong on that ??? [ Reply to This | # ]

this will continue as long as it is in someone 's best interest to do so .
At the
point that either Novell or IBM takes an action that will make it not in
someone 's best interest to continue it will end .
How to make it not in someone 's best interest ?
I 'm not sure , one thought would
be to bring criminal charges against some of the parties in this .

I 'm surprised SCO can appeal again .
I 'm not a lawyer , but that 's how it works in
France .
First trial , a judgment .
Either party , or both can appeal .
It means
second trial .
Either party can then ask the " cour de cassation " , which
does NOT judge the facts , but only verify the law has been well interpreted
during the 2 first trials .
If ( and only if ) not , the " cour de
cassation " can send back the litigation to appeal court , for a third
judgement .
But , if the " cour de cassation " says " everything OK
with the law " , it 's over .
No more appeal .
At first , French judges tend to
heavy the result , if the looser makes an appeal without strong statement .
It 's
also bad viewed if proofs are put on the table , proofs that could have been
shown during the first trial .
Appeal is some kind of " quite ou
double " .
The only way is to ask " cour de revision " , only if new proofs are
coming out , strong enough to alter the judgments .
The truth is , French judges are very corporate and do n't like to say
" justice got it wrong at first " .
My appologies for my english .
My question is " how come SCO to appeal ,
appeal an appeal , and ask for a judge to over - rule ?
What is this system where a
plaintif can gamble again and again ? " [ Reply to This | # ]

But lawmakers on a congressional subcommittee were skeptical , noting that the companies rely on “ cookie - cutter ” plans for responding to spills — with nearly verbatim safety assurances .
Exxon Mobil CEO
Rex Tillerson fueled the congressional criticism by confessing that the industry is outmatched when it comes to oil spills .
“ When these things happen , we are not well - equipped to deal with them , ” he said .
“ That ’s why the emphasis is always on preventing these things from occurring . ”
As public and official outrage continued to grow along with the disaster , Tillerson — along with the heads of the other four top U.S. oil companies , BP America , Shell Oil , Chevron and ConocoPhillips — took a grilling from lawmakers at a highly charged House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing .
While the executives fielded questions on Capitol Hill , President Barack Obama wrapped up a two - day visit to the Gulf Coast and later addressed the spill in his first - ever Oval Office speech .
Design criticized
The design of the well at the center of the disaster drew criticism Tuesday from the executives of Exxon Mobil , Chevron and Shell , who said they would have planned and drilled it differently .
Tillerson said the BP well violated design standards that are the industry norm .
“ We would not have drilled the way they did , ” he said , adding that he was puzzled why people working on the BP well made “ decisions that almost any of our drilling operations people would have made differently that led to the ultimate loss of the well . ”
Chevron CEO John Watson and Shell Oil President Marvin Odum also said the well fell short of their companies ’ standards .
“ It is not a well that we would have drilled , ” said Odum , who runs the Houston - based U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell .
BP America Chairman Lamar McKay , Odum ’s counterpart with London - based BP , emphasized that investigations are still under way to determine what happened April 20 .
They probably will reveal a combination “ of decision making , processes and equipment that interplayed to allow this to happen , ” McKay said .
“ To my knowledge , the well design is not an unusual design for the Gulf of Mexico . ”
‘ Carbon copy ’ plans
Lawmakers excoriated the companies ’ nearly identical spill response plans , which they said were fresh evidence that the industry is ill - prepared to deal with out - of - control wells .
Rep. Ed Markey , D - Mass. , said the plans tout ineffective equipment , rely on nearly identical safety assurances and make similar references to protecting walruses , “ which have not called the Gulf of Mexico home for 3 million years . ”
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , said the “ carbon copy ” plans undermined the executives ’ assurances that they are following rigorous standards on offshore rigs .
“ Exxon Mobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Shell are as unprepared as BP was , ” Waxman charged .
“ BP failed miserably when confronted with a real leak , and one can only wonder whether Exxon Mobil and the other companies would do any better , ” he said .
Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich. , said Exxon Mobil ’s response plan includes a 40 - page appendix devoted to how it will deal with reporters after an accident — compared with five pages on the plan for protecting resources and nine pages dedicated to oil removal .
Exxon Mobil has “ meticulously anticipated virtually every conversation that the company might need to have with the media in the days following an oil spill , ” Stupak said , but “ has given far less attention to actually controlling a spill . ”
Rep . Joe Barton of Ennis , the Energy and Commerce committee ’s top Republican , said the failure of a key safety device called a blowout preventer at BP ’s well shows the industry cannot afford to rely on the devices as the last defense against runaway oil and gas .
“ You ca n’t have a contingency plan that says cross your fingers and hope the blowout preventer works , ” he said .
“ We need more than a cookie cutter contingency plan . ”
‘ High degree of mistrust ’
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D - Houston , said BP ’s problems mar the entire energy industry .
“ There is certainly a high degree of mistrust by the American people ” about the industry , Jackson Lee told the executives .
Asserting that “ most of America has no stake in the energy industry ” and looks at it from a distance , she challenged the executives to convince Americans that the companies are part of national security .
Lawmakers berated the oil CEOs for spending more on advancing drilling technology to extract oil from deeper and more remote locations without devoting similar attention to improving decades - old spill response technology .
The heat will continue for BP executives , as CEO Tony Hayward and Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg are set to meet with Obama today for the first time since the oil spill began .
Hayward is set to make his first appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday , before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee scrutinizing the spill .

Is Glenn losing his edge ?
Maybe not .
Fox News ' Glenn
Beck might be a one - man $ 32 million media empire ( books , radio shows , tours and more ! ) but what 's going on with his marquee Fox News show ?
The Los Angeles Times ' Joe Flint reports that News Corp. - owned Fox News cable news ratings are still high above the competition .
But Glenn
Beck 's total number of viewers are down by almost 30 % , from 2.9 million in January to 2.1 million in April .
Glenn might not be the rising ratings juggernaut month to month , like he has always been .
But he 's still a powerhouse in the 5 p.m. timeslot .
As Joe writes , " the decline in his audience has hardly made a dent on the lead he enjoys for his 5 p.m. festival of emotions .
His rivals should hold off a little on popping the Champagne . "
Michael Calderone at Yahoo !
News has a similar assessment : " Even with smaller ratings numbers , he 's still the second - highest - rated cable news host , behind only his Fox colleague Bill O'Reilly .
And Beck 's year - to - year drop since April 2009 was more modest than others — 7 percent among total viewers and 6 percent in the age 25 - 54 demographic ( the viewership advertisers most covet ) . "
Here 's how the other cable news personalities are doing , year over year , in April :
April 09 - April 2010 in the 25 - 54 demo :
Fox News ' Bill O’Reilly– down 3 %
MSNCB 's Rachel Maddow – down 8 %
Fox News ' Greta Van Sustren – down 13 %
Fox News ' Sean Hannity – down 17 %
MSNBC's Chris Matthews – down 23 %
MSNBC's Headline News – down 26 %

A National Park Service contractor has begun the process of digging and bulldozing their way across the battlefield with the goal of restoring water to a restroom facility that has been unused for eight years .
Ignoring its own General Management plan from 1996 , the Park Service is bringing water to a “ non-historic ” building that should be removed ( according to the General Management Plan ) .
We believe the restroom should be removed and Port O Potties left in place , as the NPS has managed to do for the last eight years or so .
The restroom will be open only seven to eight months out of the year .
From the Landscape Treatment portion of the General Management Plan for Gettysburg National Military Park : “ “ Non-historic or modern structures are eliminated .
Although modern intrusions , especially from state roads and automobiles , are a fact of life on the battlefield , NPS will not condone or perpetuate modern intrusions within the Major Battle Action Area of the park . ”

Some of the Confederates advanced almost into the Union lines here , but most of them were either killed , wounded , or retreated .
Before the Union soldiers were ordered to cease firing , many bullets hit the Confederate wounded as they were laying in this area .
One soldier remembered how as he lay here , he could distinguish the different sounds made by balls that hit bodies from those that hit the ground .
But why should we remember this .

Image caption Catholicism stopped being the state religion in Italy in 1984
The Italian government is appealing to the European court of human rights to overturn a ban on classroom crucifixes .
This case against crucifixes was brought by a woman who argued that her children had a right to a secular education under Italy 's constitution .
Last year the court agreed with the mother , saying parents should be able to bring up children as they saw fit .
Her victory caused uproar in Italy , where 90 % of the population describe themselves as Christian .
Italy will start its appeal against the court 's ruling - which was widely interpreted as interference in the country 's culture , history and religion - on Wednesday .
If the government loses , it would mean that all religious artefacts in classrooms across the European Union could be outlawed .
The Vatican has already said that the European court has no right intervening in such a profoundly Italian matter , says the BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Rome .
It accused the court of wanting to ignore the role of Christianity in forming Europe 's identity .
A government minister said the ruling was " shameful " , while Education Minister Mariastella Gelmini said the crucifix was a " symbol of our tradition " , and not a mark of Catholicism .
The law requiring crucifixes to be hung in schools dates back to the 1920s and was never repealed .
But the role of Catholicism as the state religion ended in 1984 , when the official link between the Vatican and the Italian government ended .

Boston College researchers report developing a " nanocoax " technology that can support a highly efficient thin film solar cell .

A nano - scale solar cell inspired by the coaxial cable offers greater efficiency than any previously designed nanotech thin film solar cell by resolving the " thick and thin " challenge inherent to capturing light and extracting current for solar power , Boston College researchers report in the current online edition of the journal Physica Status Solidi .
The quest for high power conversion efficiency in most thin film solar cells has been hampered by competing optical and electronic constraints .
A cell must be thick enough to collect a sufficient amount of light , yet it needs to be thin enough to extract current .
Physicists at Boston College found a way to resolve the " thick & thin " challenge through a nanoscale solar architecture based on the coaxial cable , a radio technology concept that dates back to the first trans -Atlantic communications lines laid in the mid 1800s .
" Many groups around the world are working on nanowire - type solar cells , most using crystalline semiconductors , " said co-author Michael Naughton , a professor of physics at Boston College .
" This nanocoax cell architecture , on the other hand , does not require crystalline materials , and therefore offers promise for lower - cost solar power with ultrathin absorbers .
With continued optimization , efficiencies beyond anything achieved in conventional planar architectures may be possible , while using smaller quantities of less costly material . "
Optically , the so - called nanocoax stands thick enough to capture light , yet its architecture makes it thin enough to allow a more efficient extraction of current , the researchers report in PSS 's Rapid Research Letters .
This makes the nanocoax , invented at Boston College in 2005 and patented last year , a new platform for low cost , high efficiency solar power .
Constructed with amorphous silicon , the nanocoax cells yielded power conversion efficiency in excess of 8 percent , which is higher than any nanostructured thin film solar cell to date , the team reported .
The ultra - thin nature of the cells reduces the Staebler - Wronski light - induced degradation effect , a major problem with conventional solar cells of this type , according to the team .

Cuba is steadying itself for an ecological and tourism crisis as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill appears to be heading towards its pristine northern coast .
Authorities are preparing coastal communities to respond to the first sign of black slicks and have brought in Venezuelan experts to advise on damage limitation .
Patches of oil were reportedly spotted 100 miles north - west of the island , prompting concern that gulf currents will add Cuba to the list of casualties from the April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion .
Should oil reach Cuba it will be the latest twist to decades of toxic diplomatic relations between Havana and Washington .
" In Cuba , we have had small spills involving tankers on our coasts , but we 've never had to confront anything of this magnitude , " General Ramon Espinosa , vice - minister of the armed forces , told reporters at a government meeting on natural disaster preparedness .
" Nonetheless we are documenting and studying .
We are preparing with everything in our power . "
It would be a disaster for Cuba if the spill hit , he added .
A relative lack of economic development has kept the north Cuban coast – just 90 miles from Florida – a haven for manatees , migratory sea turtles and sharks .
White sand beaches are an important draw for tourists who provide an economic lifeline to the communist state .
Ramon Pardo , head of Cuban civil defence , said Havana was taking all precautions .
" The preparation of the coast , vigilance , creating all necessary conditions , preparing the people who live on the coasts that could be impacted . "
Officials said Cuba would rely on expertise from Venezuela , an ally that has long experience of offshore oil drilling and its environmental consequences , but that it was also willing to talk to the US .
Analysts said " oil diplomacy " could gift Washington and Havana a rare chance to co-operate but details remain sketchy .
The BP spill may give Cubans pause over plans to develop northern offshore deposits estimated at 5 bn barrels of oil and 10tn cubic feet of natural gas .
The Spanish company Repsol YPF is due to drill exploration wells later this year or early in 2011 .
New York Times : Government ’s new estimate puts volume of BP oil gusher at another Exxon / Valdez ‘ every 8 to 10 days ’
The United States has more than doubled the estimated size of the Gulf of Mexico oil leak , while BP ’s chairman was summoned to a White House meeting with President Barack Obama .
Carl - Henric Svanberg , the Swede who chairs BP ’s board , was invited to the meeting next Wednesday along with other company officials , but there was no mention of CEO Tony Hayward , who Obama has said he would fire , if he could , for making flippant remarks about the crisis .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The potential devastation to the Gulf Coast , its economy , and its people require relentless efforts to stop the leak and contain the damage , ” said a letter to Svanberg from Thad Allen , the Coast Guard admiral leading the US government ’s response to the crisis .
The letter was published online by Politico .
Data suggesting the leak could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day rounded off a miserable day for BP in which its share price plummeted almost 16 percent in early London trading before finishing at its lowest level since 1997 .
Investors fled for fear Obama intends to exact a heavy price from the British energy giant as its potential liability soars and US officials look to suspend prized shareholder dividends until compensation is paid .
Although it later recouped most of its loss , BP ’s share price has collapsed more than 40 percent — wiping tens of billions of dollars off its market value — since the Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Friday could be worse as the markets had already closed by the time Marcia NcNutt , chairing the US government ’s flow rate assessment team , doubled the previous official flow figures of between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels per day .
“ The lowest estimate that we ’re seeing that the scientists think is credible is probably about 20,000 barrels , and the highest that we ’re seeing is probably a little over 40,000 , ” McNutt told reporters .
For angry Americans digesting daily images of oiled birds and crude - covered marshes , this only reinforced the impression that BP has been disingenuous about the size of the spill from the start to try to limit its liability .
ADVERTISEMENT
The company ’s first estimate was only 1,000 barrels per day and it stuck to a later estimate of 5,000 barrels a day even as that amount was being siphoned to the surface with more oil and natural gas still clearly gushing out .
A containment device fitted last week is now capturing 15,800 barrels a day , but the latest data suggests at least 4,200 barrels and possibly up to 25,000 barrels , more than one million gallons , is still spewing into the sea each day .
ADVERTISEMENT
At least 40 million gallons of crude has already poured into the Gulf , and perhaps double that .
By comparison , the Exxon Valdez tanker leaked roughly 11 million gallons into the sea off the Alaskan coast in 1989 .
The latest plunge in BP ’s share price came the day after US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the company ’s liability should include reimbursements for all companies hit by a six - month moratorium on deep sea drilling .
Asked during a Senate grilling if the government will make BP pay out to all companies that go out of business , take bankruptcy or lay off workers , Salazar replied : “ The answer to that is , yes , we will .
BP is responsible . ”

US government officials said BP had agreed to speed up payouts to individuals and businesses affected by the spill following a meeting with Admiral Allen .
In an interview with AFP , Allen said BP had responded to a letter ordering it to inform the US government by Friday of its contingency planning for the containment system and said he was satisfied by its response .
The imminent arrival of a second processing vessel is expected to boost the capacity of the containment system to 28,000 barrels and Allen said further operations would be carried out over the “ next three to four weeks ” to put down a new mooring at the site .
The mooring will allow a super tanker and more equipment to be brought in to place a more fitted cap on the leak that can capture all the leaking oil and make the system easier to disconnect in the event of a hurricane .
ADVERTISEMENT
A permanent solution will not come before the first of two relief wells are drilled , in August at the earliest , allowing the leak to be plugged with cement .
Obama , who heads to the Gulf next week for his fourth visit since the disaster , met Thursday at the White House with relatives of the 11 workers killed when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded .

( CNN ) --
A graduate student is suing a Georgia university , alleging that professors are requiring her to change her " biblical views " on homosexuality or be expelled from the counseling program there .
Jennifer Keeton filed a civil rights action in U.S. District Court on July 21 saying Augusta State University violated her " constitutional rights of speech , belief and religious exercise . "
The action says university faculty have " promised to expel " Keeton " because she has communicated both inside and outside the classroom that she holds to Christian ethical conviction on matters of human sexuality and gender identity . "
After Keeton expressed her views verbally and in written assignments , faculty mandated Keeton complete a " remediation plan . "
CNN obtained a copy of the remediation plan from the Alliance Defense Fund , which represents Keeton in the action .
The plan addresses issues such as writing ability and organizational skills , as well as Keeton 's ability to be a " multiculturally competent counselor , particularly in regard to working with gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender and queer / questioning populations . "
Among the plan 's requirements , Keeton was to attend at least three diversity workshops , get more exposure to gay populations ( one suggestion was to attend a gay pride parade in Augusta , where the university is located ) , do outside reading about gays and write reflections on these experiences and how they might benefit future clients .
At first , Keeton agreed to the remediation plan , according to the suit .
Then , she had second thoughts .
In video provided by the Alliance Defense Fund , Keeton says , " I want to stay in the school counseling program , [ but ]
I can't honestly complete the remediation program knowing I would have to alter by beliefs .
I 'm not willing to -- and I know I can't -- change my biblical views . "
In a statement to CNN , Augusta State said it " does not discriminate against any individuals on the basis of their personal , social , political , or religious beliefs or views .
No student is asked to change their religious beliefs or views in order to participate in any program . "
Without commenting specifically on the Keeton suit , the university also said , " The professional counselor 's job is to help clients clarify their current feelings and behaviors and to help them reach the goals that they have determined for themselves , not to dictate what those goals should be , what morals they should possess , or what values they should adopt . "
In an interview Wednesday on " CNN NewsRoom , " David French , a senior counsel with the Alliance Defense Fund , said all Keeton did " was express her religious views inside of class and outside of class . "
" As a result of that , she 's being subjected to what is best described as a thought - reform program , " French said .
" It all goes back to a student engaging in constitutionally protected speech . "
French added there was no allegation Keeton has done anything to harm anyone in a counseling setting , or violated any code of ethics .
Also appearing on the program were Erin Martz , manager of Ethics and Professional Standards for the American Counseling Association , and Gregory Nevins , a supervising senior staff attorney for the advocacy group Lambda Legal .
Martz said the ACA 's code of ethics " is not an issue of thought - policing or putting any restrictions on beliefs of any kind . "
" The code is concerned with counselors ' behaviors and how they interact with their clients , " she said .
" Talking to others -- espousing ideas about homosexuality or other beliefs is a behavior , " Martz said .
" And if that behavior goes into imposing values , that does become an issue . "
French said the remediation program itself seeks to change Keeton 's beliefs .
He said while the ACA code prohibits imposing values , " these counseling professors have won the gold medal in the Olympics of imposing values by trying to change her religious beliefs . "
" This is not an issue about conduct in any form of a counseling setting , " French said .
" This is a First Amendment issue about freedom of expression . "
Nevins , the attorney for Lambda Legal , said the potential problem is that " many people , especially young people in the coming - out or questioning process , are looking for a sympathetic and understanding ear .
" To have somebody who is going to introduce their value system in a negative way can be extremely damaging , " he said .
French said Keeton has repeatedly told the counseling department she would uphold the valid code of ethics of the American Counseling Association .
Asked how Keeton would respond in a hypothetical situation of a child coming to her and saying he was gay , French said Keeton would respond in an " ethical and appropriate way . "
French said the counseling department has imposed its own set of values to " cleanse " Christianity from students ' belief system , violating its own ethics code .
When Nevins mentioned that Keeton espoused " conversion therapy , " French said the allegation was unsubstantiated .
Nevins said Keeton 's or anyone 's belief system had to be " pushed to one side . "
Martz concurred , saying , " In the counseling profession , as with the medical profession , the needs of the client supercede the needs of the counselor . "
Keeton 's suit asks for nominal and actual damages based on violation of her civil rights .

To many people , Barbara Harris is a dangerous woman .
A maverick " do - gooder " from California , she has been accused of effectively promoting eugenics via the back door by paying for drug addicts to be sterilised .
Despite being lambasted in the media and condemned by health experts in the UK , Harris is visiting cities around Britain looking to launch pilot projects that will help her achieve her goal of reducing " the number of substance - exposed births to zero " .
While Harris may have been subjected to savage criticism from the authorities , a significant portion of the public are warming to her views .
The website of Harris 's charity , Project Prevention , boasts scores of emails from Britons supportive of her aims , many of whom have pledged donations while expressing anger that the government will not introduce a similar scheme of its own .
Typical comments read : " I had to deal with this issue as a teacher and it enraged me .
I hope you are successful in the UK and not defeated by the liberal urban elite who seem to dominate our country with their wishy - washy half - hearted solutions to our deep social problems .
I have made a donation . "
Another , from a child protection solicitor for a county council , adds : " All I want to say to you is thank god for project prevention !
Congratulations on coming to the UK .
I get tired of hearing about drug addicts ' rights while children suffer …
I hope to see the success of this project in my everyday work . "
Harris has talked up her growing UK support base on Twitter , although backing for her ideals is by no means uniform .
Many of the comments on the site and other social networking online platforms are hostile .
Some experts are reluctant to condemn Harris outright .
" The problem that Ms Harris is trying to address is a real one , " concedes Julian Sheather , the British Medical Association 's ethics manager , writing in a personal capacity on the British Medical Journal 's blog .
" A small number of drug - addicted women give birth to a succession of drug - dependent children who are taken into foster care .
It is by any standards an appalling start in life .
" There is a certain red-necked ' it does what it says on the can ' appeal to Ms Harris 's response .
Her championing the rights of the unborn over the rights of addict mothers also has a certain populist appeal . "
However , Sheather warns , Harris 's actions raise serious ethical issues .
" Even Project Prevention admits the money will almost always go to feed the addict 's habit , " he notes .
" Would the addiction render consent invalid ?
Is the payment a coercive means of getting people to agree to a sterilisation they would otherwise not contemplate ? "
Since it was founded in 1994 , Project Prevention has paid 3,388 people in the US to be sterilised or to take long - term contraception measures .
Of these , 1,059 have chosen Depo - Provera , a long - term injectable contraceptive ; 1,260 chose tubal ligation – sterilisation – while the remainder have opted for coils or implants .
Just under 50 men have had vasectomies .
In the US , addicts are offered up to $ 300 ( £ 200 ) for sterilisation .
The charity states its objective is " to reduce the burden of this social problem on taxpayers , trim down social worker caseloads , and alleviate from our clients the burden of having children that will potentially be taken away . "
Felicia Le May , a former crystal meth addict who opted for sterilisation after having nine children , told the Sun : " At first I was scared , but then I thought , ' I have too many kids already . '
" They 've suffered so much through having both parents addicted .
I had my children taken away for two years because of my meth addiction .
That was the worst time of my life .
I did n't want to risk putting any more babies through the same thing . "
Her story is typical of those who have sought help from Project Prevention , which was founded by Harris after she adopted four of eight children born to a Los Angeles addict .
Harris said that she decided to take action after spending " countless hours watching her children fight through withdrawal " .
There have been accusations the charity focuses disproportionately on black people .
It insists it " targets a behaviour , not a racial demographic " .
Since she arrived in the UK earlier this month there have been reports that a woman was approached near a health centre in Glasgow by three women from Project Prevention who offered her £ 200 if she agreed to be sterilised .
The woman was with her nine - year - old son and was not a drug addict .
However , Harris told the Observer in an email that the story was untrue .
" We never approach people on the street , " she said , adding : " We never assume someone is an addict , no matter where we go .
We approach people asking if they know any drug addicts they can give our info to . "
The controversy generated by her visit to the UK this month has focused attention on the risks to children of drug addicts .
It is reported that one out of every 264 babies born in Scotland suffers withdrawal symptoms from mothers who use drugs including heroin and cannabis .
In a sign that she is serious about bringing her vision to the UK , Harris confirmed that she is seeking UK charitable status , though there are questions over whether the Charity Commission will approve this given the group 's controversial aims .
Harris also confirmed she is considering several cities in the UK for potential pilot projects , although she has yet to decide whether she will proceed .
Martin Barnes , chief executive of DrugScope , an independent organisation that examines drug issues , accused Project Prevention of applying what could be " a simplistic , moralistic and exploitative approach to addressing the difficult and complex issue of drug use and pregnancy " .
He added : " The welfare of children is paramount , but using cash incentives to often poor and vulnerable women is highly questionable .
For many women with drug problems , the chance to become a mother can be life - changing and a powerful motivation to seek help for their addiction and other problems in their lives . "
He warned that legitimising Project Prevention could have significant repercussions .
" Where should the line be drawn ?
Women who drink ?
Women who smoke ?
Women with mental health problems ?
Women who themselves have been the victim of abuse ? "
OSH , Kyrgyzstan — Rumors of alleged atrocities helped stoke the inter-ethnic conflagration that raged in this southern Kyrgyz city over the past week , and they are now threatening to unravel an uneasy peace .
News that an angry Uzbek mob broke into a local dormitory and raped ( and killed , depending on which version you heard ) two Kyrgyz female students quickly spread through the ethnic Kyrgyz sections of Osh last Thursday evening .
The story struck a particular nerve — Kyrgyz and Uzbeks are traditional societies ( and both Sunni Muslims ) and react to issues of sexual violations with particular severity .
It did n’t matter that the information was n’t true — the Uzbeks did not step foot in the dormitory .
Within hours , a cry went up through the ethnic Kyrgyz sections of the city , calling for revenge .
“ My sister called me at 1:30 in the morning , ” said Rustam , an ethnic Uzbek married to a Kyrgyz .
“ She said , ‘ The Kyrgyz are rising up , they ’re saying that the Uzbeks are cutting them to pieces . ' ”
The Uzbeks , for their part , had their own rumors that they were reacting to .
On that fateful Thursday night , a crowd of several hundred of them did in fact go on a rampage , burning businesses and breaking windows .
But participants say that they were responding to reports of a series of confrontations between Kyrgyz and them the previous days , which also may not have been entirely accurate .
Many observers here and abroad — including U.S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — suspect that the anti-Uzbek pogroms that subsequently swept over Osh and then neighboring city Jalal - Abad like a prairie fire might have been the work of outside forces .
The initial altercations that sparked the fighting could have been intentional provocations , as was the manner in which the news was quickly disseminated .
And the revenge mobs that quickly formed and descended on the Uzbek neighborhoods may have been organized in advance .
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Nari Pillay called the attacks “ orchestrated , targeted , and well - planned . ”
Uzbek houses and business went up in flames .
As many as 2,000 people may have died , according to Kyrgyz President Roza Otunbayeva .
This figure may climb even higher .
But the events that led to the slaughter are still taken at face value .
Despite the fact that the dormitory in question is located in central Osh and can be easily reached , no one disputes the allegations of what happened there — including the mayor ’s office , which backs up this version of events .
But even if the pogroms were orchestrated , they still found strong support among the Kyrgyz population ; the reports of the Uzbek crowd ’s alleged atrocities are still used as justification for what transpired to their entire community afterwards .
“ The Uzbeks started all this — they ’re the guilty ones , ” said Kasym Anarbaev , director Osh - Gu University , standing not far from where the dormitory is located .
“ They broke into the dormitory and raped and strung up those girls . ”
Responding to the question of why so many Uzbeks needed to suffer for what might have been the actions of a few hundred enraged rioters , Daniyar , a ethnic Kyrgyz soldier wielding a Kalashnikov ( and who preferred to give only his first name ) simply said : “ Those Uzbeks should have thought about the consequences before they started this .
They got what was coming to them . ”
Amid the jumble of facts and rumors , accusations and counter - accusations over who is ultimately to blame for the violence , one fact is indisputable : both Kyrgyz and Uzbeks are terrified of what may come next .
The Uzbeks , however , it must be said , are more afraid — and with good reason : they bore the brunt of the fighting .
Although the death toll is still climbing — and many of Kyrgyz seem to among this number — they suffered disproportionately .
Outside observers who witnessed the hostilities , like independent journalist Dalton Bennett , have documented some of the Uzbeks ’ losses .
Bennett described numerous terrible scenes , including a 14 - year - old boy killed by sniper fire being delivered to a hospital , and the corpse of a pregnant Uzbek woman .
Those Uzbeks who live in primarily Uzbek sections of Osh have now barricaded themselves behind freshly dug trenches and overturned cars ; a number who live in ethnically mixed sections of the city venture out infrequently to buy supplies from the recently opened stores or nervously trade stories with neighbors .
Hundreds of thousands have fled Osh and Jalal - Abad , the two southern cities that saw the worst of the fighting .
About 100,000 of these escaped to neighboring Uzbekistan , where they are testing the local authorities ’ ability to cope with the humanitarian crisis .
Hordes have descended upon Surot - Tash , an ethnic - Uzbek town on the Kyrgyz - Uzbek border .
Women and children are mostly crammed into the locals ’ houses , sometimes as many as 30 in a single structure .
They say that they ca n’t stay where they are , but also many have nowhere to return to — their houses were burned to cinders .
Kyrgyzstan — and more importantly Osh — is their home and they do n’t want to live anywhere else .
But they also say that they fear for their future , and the violence that may await them if they return .
“ We are afraid .
We ca n’t live next to them — there will be war , ” said Odina Imendzhanova a refugee from Osh , as she was standing in the shadow of the town ’s main mosque , which had been turned into a field hospital .
But once again the rumors are taking central stage .
During the fighting , a story spread that one side or the other had poisoned the city ’s water supply .
Then there were claims of acts of barbarity : headless corpses , limbless bodies , babies that were dispatched by various gruesome methods , after they had been ripped from there mothers ' arms .
Now the rumor making the rounds is that the next installment of the fighting will begin June 21 or 22 .
Kyrgyz believe that the Uzbeks will try to exact revenge .
Uzbeks think that the Kyrgyz will look to finish the job .
And stories of rape are again spreading like wildfire .
It is possible that these stories are true — both sides were inflamed to the point of hysteria .
But this particular accusation — given its history within this very conflict — should also inspire a level of caution .
A case in point was a recent report that 10 Uzbek women had been raped during the brutal fighting and looting in the Cheryomushki section of Osh .
GlobalPost visited the field hospital where the story emanated from .
One ethnic Uzbek doctor who had worked at the hospital during the duration of the crisis said it was definitely not true : no women had claimed that they had been raped , he said .
Another nurse said that the number of victims was in fact two , but she knew this for a fact .
When questioned further , she admitted that she did not speak to the girls in question , nor their parents ( who were originally quoted as sources ) , but in fact had “ overheard some women ” who claimed it happened .
The story took however a number of forms in its telling , and the nurse in question could not name the victims .
“ This is a provocation , ” said a nurse present at the interview , who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue .
“ I can imagine the Kyrgyz burning houses , even killing .
But rape ?
That ’s a very serious issue for Muslims .
You have to be sure if you say a thing like that . ”
HOLA , AMERICA
Consider that a new AP poll says President Obama ’s favorability ratings among the burgeoning Hispanic voting bloc are only “ tepid . ”
Against that background , a deft strategy has emerged from the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles , which has launched “ Vota Tus Valores ” — vote your values — a $ 1 million voter - outreach campaign to educate Hispanic voters about the pro-life / traditional marriage / free - enterprise platform of U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina in California .
“ Now is the time for the Latino voice to be heard .
We are tired of being taken for granted by Democrats who expect our ‘ minority vote , ’ but do n’t respect us or our values .
The Latino vote is waking up , ” says Alfonso Aguilar , the group ’s executive director .
The pro-life Susan B. Anthony
List also is joining the fray with its own $ 100,000 outreach to California ’s Hispanic voters , which account for up to 20 percent of the state ’s entire electorate .
“ Poll after poll shows that the overwhelming majority of Latino voters call themselves pro-life and that Latino voters are comprising an increasing percentage of the voting bloc .
We ’ve been waiting for Carly Fiorina since the day Barbara Boxer was elected , ” says the group ’s president , Marjorie Dannenfelser .

“ In 1985 , you guys might remember when Tipper Gore wanted to put ‘ offensive ’ labels on music , and your album with Twisted Sister was one of the targets .
What did they call it ? ” daytime talk - show host Wendy Williams asked Dee Snider , frontman for the aforementioned band .
“ The song ‘ We ’re Not Going to Take It ’ was part of the ‘ filthy 15 , ’ for violence — they said it was a violent song .
They wanted to rate everything .
I went down to Washington with Frank Zappa and John Denver to testify before Congress , and I was the scourge of society .
I was the poster boy for everything wrong with society .
Let ’s cut to 25 years later .
I ’m still married — none of my kids have been busted for drug possession .
Can Al and Tipper Gore say the same thing ?
I do n’t think so , ” Mr. Snider observed .

Lean - faced , perfectly on message and sporting a very snappy goatee , former senator and presidential hopeful Fred Thompson has surfaced in a new advocacy ad for the League of American Voters , reminding the public that everybody ’s taxes will go up in five months , once President George W. Bush ’s tax cuts expire Dec. 31
“ Our nation faces a massive automatic tax increase at the end of this year when the Bush tax cuts expire , ” Mr. Thompson says .
“ When that happens , your income taxes could increase by 10 percent or more , capital - gains taxes will jump more than 30 percent , and taxes on dividends will more than double .
It ’s not a pretty picture . ”

Beware , big government .
Sen .
John Cornyn of Texas has introduced a bill titled “ The Health Care Bureaucrats Elimination Act , ” co-sponsored by fellow Republican Sens.
Orrin Hatch of Utah , Jon Kyl of Arizona , Pat Roberts of Kansas and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma .
The legislation is intended to “ remove unelected , unaccountable bureaucrats ” from the personal health decisions of senior citizens .
The bill would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board ( IPAB ) .
“ In true fashion of Obama - Reid - Pelosi hubris , the IPAB is the definition of a government takeover , ” Mr. Cornyn says .
“ This bill to repeal IPAB is just one step towards starting over with real health care reform that empowers patients instead of Beltway bureaucrats . ”

Several cases of painful dengue fever , a potentially fatal viral disease transmitted by “ urban dwelling ” mosquitoes , have recently been reported in the U.S. , says the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene , primarily in Texas and Florida .
“ Despite the threat of further introduction of dengue into the mainland United States , as well as the risk of introduction of additional vector - borne diseases , President Obama ’s 2011 fiscal budget reduces to zero the funding to support the vector - borne infectious - disease program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , ” the group says .
“ Although we recognize and applaud the need to constantly scan the federal budget to identify outdated or unnecessary programs , eliminating the CDC ’s vector - borne infectious - disease program is not one of these areas .
The proposed cuts to this program would be shortsighted , and would harm the health of the American people , ” says Dr. Edward T. Ryan , president of the 107 - year - old medical group .

Second major solar plant announced as country edges towards target of generating 20 per cent of energy from renewables by 2020
The Egyptian Electricity Ministry has unveiled plans to build a new $ 700 m 100 MW solar power plant between 2012 and 2017 that should further establish the country as one of the leading developers of utility - scale solar plants .
According to reports in the local Al - Ahram newspaper , the solar power project at Kom Ombo , near the Aswan High Dam hydro- electric plant , will be financed by a number of international institutions , including the African Development Fund and the World Bank .
Additional finance is also expected to be provided through the UN's Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) carbon offsetting scheme .
The project is part of a five - year plan running from 2012 - 2017 designed to establish the Egypt as one of the top generators of solar energy in North Africa , electricity ministry undersecretary Aktham Abou el - Ella told news agency Reuters .
The project will be the nation 's second large scale solar power project following the country 's first solar plant at El - Koraymat , south of Cairo , which is expected to be finished later this year and will produce 20 MW of solar power alongside 120 MW of conventional natural gas power .
The vast majority of Egypt 's power is currently provided by natural gas - fired power stations , with a small percentage coming from large scale hydroelectric plants on the Nile delta .
However , the country 's government has pledged to generate 20 per cent of its power from renewable sources by 2020 , which it hopes to achieve largely through wind and solar expansion .
It is also eyeing the potential to export solar energy to southern Europe as part of the high profile Desertec initiative .
Northern Africa has been touted as a potential hub for solar energy generation given its low levels of rain and year - round sun , but uptake of the technology has been slow , largely because of high capital costs .
Egypt will need to dramatically accelerate the rate at which it deploys solar technologies if it is to meet its ambitious renewable energy targets .
Electricity
generation is currently growing at a rates of seven to eight per cent a year , due to a growing economy and increasing use of air conditioning units , and a government - sponsored report last year estimated the country will need to have at least 1GW of solar capacity alongside 7.2GW of wind capacity to meet its 2020 renewables target while satisfying the growing demand for power .
The government also has a long way to go to meet its wind energy target .
There has been large scale wind farm development along Egypt 's eastern Red Sea coast , but even with huge new wind farms at Zafarana and Hurghada having recently come online the country 's total installed capacity currently stands at just 430 MW .
However , plenty of new projects are in the pipeline and last month the World Bank awarded Egypt a $ 220 m loan to support the Wind Power Development Project , which aims to develop the infrastructure and business models needed to scale up wind power in the country .
The initiative will include the funding of new transmission lines to connect Egypt 's largest wind farm , the 250MW Gabal el - Zait project , to the national grid .
" Some of the world 's best wind power resources are in Egypt , especially in the areas of the Gulf of Suez , where at least 7.2GW could be potentially developed by 2022 , with further 3GW on the west and east banks of the Nile , " the World Bank said in a statement at the time .
BJ Penn has had little time to dwell on losing his lightweight title belt to Frankie Edgar on Saturday night as he’s now going on a media blitz to support the release of his new biography , “ BJ Penn : Why I Fight – The Belt Is Just An Accessory , ” which is in stores from today .
Today Penn appeared on Fox News to discuss his book , and in an impromptu skit , Fox host Brian Kilmeade challenged him to show how he would neutralize him in a fight .
The former 155 lb champ duly obliged and wrestled the 170lb reporter , and after some resistance from the host as it dawned on him that he was getting owned on live TV , Penn locked up a kimura submission while one of Kilmeade ’s colleagues threw in the towel ( well it was a suit jacket , but who ’s counting ! ) .
As an unsteady Kilmeade was helped to his feet his female co-host then finished off the segment with a flourish by stating , “ After that Brian ’s going to need some new health care , and that ’s what we ’re going to talk about ( next ) . . ”
Update : BJ Penn ’s antics on Fox News were used on Comedy Centrals hit program , ‘ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart ’ last night .

I hate celebrity “ news ” .
My disdain for it should be obvious from the way I put quotes around the word news right there .
But even worse is “ celebrity ” “ news ” , coverage of people who ’ve never themselves done anything noteworthy .
Yet somehow , I could n’t help but be amused by a particular recent bit of “ celebrity ” “ news ” .
This story features a relative of the ridiculous Lindsay Lohan , a black card ( or at least a knock - off ) , and Carvel ice cream .
Best of all , it ’s got arrogance and self - conceit , followed by comeuppance , which is my absolute favorite kind of uppance .
The story starts in 2009 , when Carvel Ice Cream was celebrating its 75th anniversary1 .
Apparently , as part of this promotion , they issued a Carvel Black Card to 75 celebrities :
Presumably , the marketing thinking behind this was that such a card would draw the chosen celebrities into Carvel ’s stores .
With the help of the paparazzi who would be sure to be taking pictures , Carvel would receive nearly free publicity .
It seems like a solid enough plan , but it all goes off the rails when your list of chosen celebrities includes Lindsay Lohan ( as well as her sister Ali ) .
This error in judgement was rapidly exposed , as Lindsay and Ali ’s mother Dina repeatedly used the card herself , without either of the girls present .
According to Carvel :
These cards were issued in the celebrity ’s name and require the card holder to be present at the time of use …
Unfortunately , the Lohan family has been abusing the card .
While the card was issued in Lindsay and Ali ’s names only , their extended family has repeatedly used the card without either present .
The matter came to a head June 16th , when Dina Lohan attempted to use the card while picking up an ice cream cake .
Upon being asked for ID , and having the card confiscated , the elder Ms. Lohan called the police .
There ’s a good use of taxpayer dollars .
Ultimately the police returned the card to Ms. Lohan , though they instructed her not to use it again .
She did not receive her ice cream cake free of charge , proving there ’s some justice in the world , even if it ’s just very stupid justice .
Speaking with Radar Online just after the incident , Ms. Lohan promised revenge :
“ Just wait until Lindsay and Ali hear about this , ” she said .
“ When Ali gets back , I ’m going to bring her in everyday to this store — and you can print that ! ”
You diabolical she - devil !
Why , you ’ll eat them right out of business !
However will Carvel respond ?
At first , we graciously honored their requests while explaining that the Black Card was not a carte blanche for unlimited Carvel Ice Cream for the extended Lohan family and friends .
After more than six months of numerous and large orders for ice cream , we finally had to cut off the card and take it back .
Oh .
That ’s how .
What did the overweening Dina Lohan have to say about the incident ?
“ It just shows how we [ Lohans ] get treated so much worse than regular people2 . ”
Perhaps the problem , Dina , is that you are so much worse than “ regular people ” .

By Dmitry Solovyov MOSCOW , July 13 ( Reuters ) – One of the fiercest heatwaves in its history has engulfed Russia , withering crops , causing the worst drought in 130 years and prompting a top public health official to call for Spanish - style siesta breaks .
Central parts of European Russia , the Volga region , southern Urals and Siberia have all been suffering from the scorching heat , which started in late June and often reaches 40 degrees Celsius ( 104 Fahrenheit ) in the shade .
Similar conditions have only occurred five times — in 1919 , 1920 , 1936 , 1938 and 1972 — since Russia started recording temperatures 130 years ago , Valery Lukyanov , deputy head of Russia ’s main weather forecast centre Roshydromet , told Reuters .
The car Toyota would have raced in F1 this year has been driven by Kazuki Nakajima in Cologne .
The TF110 has been revealed and inspected by Racecar Engineering .
and looks outwardly similar to the BMW Sauber C29 with a high , long nose .
Toyota ’s 11th hour exit from Formula 1 at the end of 2009 means this car will never compete in F1 .
Two examples of the TF110 were built despite the team ’s decision at the end of last year not to contest the 2010 championship .
According to the magazine the design features “ one of the most extreme diffusers seen yet ” and a ride height adjustment system .
Who knows how competitive the TF110 would have been .
It ’s doubtful that , even if another team acquired the intellectual property rights to use the car in 2011 , it could be suitably modified to be competitive following further changes to F1 ’s technical regulations .
The manner in which Toyota exited the sport within days of the 2009 season ending is a reminder of how close the former Honda team came to disappearing 12 months earlier .
As Ross Brawn explained afterwards , the company ’s management had n’t given any thought to passing the team on to another owner and had to be persuaded to accept Brawn ’s management buy - out .
It seems much the same happened at Toyota .
While BMW also , though with some difficulty , passed ownership of their team back to Peter Sauber , Toyota cut and run and there was no going back .
Attempts by Zoran Stefanovich to use the cars to obtain an entry failed .
Recently former Toyota boss Tadashi Yamashina explained how the onset of the credit crunch hastened the team ’s departure from Formula 1 .
It ’s a pity to see an F1 car , built at considerable expense , sat idle when it could be competing .
Hopefully we ’ll only have to wait until next year to see F1 get back to 26 - car grids .

SAN FRANCISCO – Their chants – “ Arnold , Arnold get a clue , better raise some revenue ! ” and “ Tax the oil , tax the booze , save the services we all use ! ” - reverberated off buildings along Market St as hundreds of seniors , low - income parents , people with disabilities and their supporters marched through downtown June 3 on their way to a spirited Union Square rally .
There they demanded that Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the legislature manage the state ’s $ 19 billion budget shortfall with “ smart and common sense ” revenue solutions instead of slashing human services .
Chris Finn is on the Board of Directors of Community Resources for Independent Living , which helps people with disabilities obtain independent living services .
A wheelchair user , Finn said if proposed cuts go through , he would lose nearly 250 hours per month of disability services through In Home Supportive Services and other programs .
“ I would n’t be able to get out of bed , use the bathroom , shower , eat – in short , I would n’t be able to live . ”
The alternative , moving to a nursing home , would cost the government over twice as much for a far less satisfactory level of care and quality of life , Finn said .
Finn also works with the Bay Area Outreach and Recreation Program .
The first power soccer player in the country to also be named a coach , he has traveled the world in connection with this sport for users of power wheelchairs .
“ If the cuts go through , ” he said , “ I could n’t participate in these programs that help people lead independent lives . ”
Finn also pointed out that if services are slashed , hundreds of thousands of caregivers and service providers would lose their jobs , weakening the economy still further .
Jhequela King , wearing the bright red tee - shirt of Lifetime ( Low Income Families ’ Empowerment through Education ) said she is studying at area community colleges to become a respiratory therapist .
The mother of a nine - month - old , King is in the CalWORKS welfare - to - work program .
Gov. Schwarzenegger wants to eliminate CalWORKS , which would make California the only state without such a program .
“ I want to be in a position to help others , ” King said .
“ If the program is ended I would have to give up school , and I ’d be stuck in a low - income dead end . ”
As the march wound through downtown , it passed facilities of a number of corporations , including Chase Bank , the Hilton Hotel and Burger King , that organizers said benefit from tax loopholes costing the state hundreds of thousands in revenue .
Rally speakers , including Board of Education member Norman
Yee , emphasized that the threatened services are not only vital to recipients ’ very lives , but they are also far more cost - effective for state government than the alternatives , and more could be lost in federal matching funds than would be saved by the cuts .
Democratic legislators have introduced bills to close corporate loopholes , reinstate previous tax rates for the highest income earners , and impose an oil severance tax , but the governor and the Republican legislative minority refuse to consider any tax increases .
California is the only state requiring a two - thirds legislative majority to pass a budget and to raise taxes , and the Democratic majority falls short of that level .
With the new fiscal year set to start July 1 , the constitutional deadline to pass a budget is June 15 .
But in recent years that deadline has often been missed by many weeks , gravely complicating the state ’s ability to meet its obligations .
As the rally wound down , organizers gave out the governor ’s office phone number , ( 916 ) 445-2841 , urging all present to call it and share it with friends and family .
Among nearly two dozen march sponsors were California Partnership , California Alliance of Retired Americans , Health Access , Mujeres Unidas y Activas , and the San Francisco Labor Council .

The trophy was made up of 11kg ( 24 lbs ) of cocaine
A replica World Cup trophy seized by anti-drugs police in Colombia is made out of cocaine , lab tests have confirmed .
The 36 cm ( 14in ) statue was found in a delivery crate at Bogota airport .
The crate was in an airmail warehouse waiting to be sent to an address in Spain , airport anti-drug chief Jose Piedrahita said .
In another development , a submarine built by drug - traffickers was found in Ecuador before its maiden voyage .
The World Cup replica was made up of 11kg ( 24 lb ) of the drug , mixed with acetone or gasoline to make it mouldable .
The gold - painted statue was found on a routine sweep of the airport on Friday , authorities said .
The Ecuadorian submarine , capable of carrying tonnes of cocaine , was discovered in a river near the border with Colombia , the US Drug Enforcement Agency said .
The camouflaged 31 m- ( 100 ft - ) long vessel has a conning tower , periscope and air - conditioning system .
One man was arrested .

According ...
Israeli authorities have threatened four Palestinian politicians with expulsion from Jerusalem because of their affiliation to Hamas in a case which could have wide ramifications for others deemed undesirable by the Jewish state .
Mohammed Abu Tir , 59 , a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) , is in police custody for failing to leave the city by the end of last month .
Instantly recognisable for his dyed orange beard , Abu Tir was released from an Israeli prison in May after almost four years , and was immediately told he must abandon political activity or leave Jerusalem .
Two other members of the PLC and a former Palestinian minister have moved into the grounds of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent in East Jerusalem in protest at the deportation orders .
The men's cases are to be heard by the supreme court in September .
However the court rejected a plea to prohibit deportation in the interim , so the men are at risk of being expelled from the city at any time .
The threatened deportations are part of a wider pattern of revoking the Jerusalem residency permits of Palestinians from the city .
In most cases , Israel claims that the people it strips of the right to live in Jerusalem have voluntarily relocated to the West Bank or abroad .
This is often contested by the individuals concerned and human rights groups representing them .
In 2008 , more than 4,500 Palestinians were excluded from Jerusalem .
However the case of the four Hamas politicians is the first time Israel has cited political grounds for expelling people from the city .
" For the first time Israel is using a claim of disloyalty to revoke residency , " said Hasan Jabarin , director of the Israeli human rights group Adalah .
" The consequences for Palestinians in East Jerusalem are dangerous .
This case could open a new window to revoking residency on purely political grounds . "
Abu
Tir was imprisoned with dozens of Hamas politicians and activists after the Palestinian election in January 2006 , which was won by the Islamic militant party .
" The election was legal and transparent .
They found themselves in jail simply because they were elected , " said Jabarin .
The men's case has been raised in the past week in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords .
Labour MP Andrew Slaughter asked whether the British government had raised the issue with the Israeli government .
Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , urged Israel to " stop these sort of actions " .
Ahmad Bahar , the deputy speaker of the Palestinian parliament , described the revocation of residency permits as a " massive ethnic cleansing campaign " .
More than 270,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem , which Israel occupied and annexed in 1967 .
In a separate development , Israel 's supreme court has rejected a petition on behalf of Gazan lawyer Fatima Sharif to be allowed to travel to the West Bank to begin a masters degree in human rights , citing the " current political - security situation " .
The Israel Defence Forces made it clear in the court hearing yesterday that there would be no relaxation of the policy restricting the movement of Palestinians in and out of Gaza except in the most extreme circumstances , despite Israel 's decision to ease its blockade of the territory .
The mother of nine - month - old twin girls has described her " living nightmare " after her daughters were apparently mauled by a fox as they slept in their cots in east London .
Lola and Isabella Koupparis were attacked at about 2200 BST on Saturday .
A police source said the fox apparently entered the house through an open ground - floor door before attacking the twins in an upstairs room .
Both girls suffered arm injuries and one is thought to have facial injuries .
The twins remain in a serious but stable condition .
One of the girls has been transferred from the Royal London Hospital to Great Ormond Street Hospital for further treatment , Barts and The London NHS Trust said .
The girls ' mother , Pauline , told BBC London 94.9 : " It 's a living nightmare .
" It 's something I would never have expected to happen - let alone to us and my beautiful girls , " she added .
Mrs Koupparis said she heard a noise , described as " a funny cry , not a normal cry " , coming from the room where the twins were sleeping .
She added : " It was quite muffled but very pained .
I went into the room and I saw some blood in Isabella 's cot , I thought she had a nosebleed .
" I put on the light , I saw the fox , it just looked at me and it was n't even scared of me .
" I started screaming as I realised Lola was also covered in blood . "
URBAN FOXES
In Britain , foxes were first established in cities such as London and Bristol during the 1940s
Estimates suggest that as many as 10,000 red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes ) may be living in the London area alone
Foxes principally come into gardens for food and shelter - householders are advised to make sure that foxes get neither on their properties
One concern about foxes is the possibility of the spread of disease to humans and pets
Another concern is ' mange ' , caused by mites , which can live on foxes
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) is asking people to report sightings of urban deer and foxes in the first nationwide survey to look at where animals are invading gardens
How common are fox attacks ?
It is thought the fox may have entered through a door which had been left open because of the warm weather .
The girls ' parents , Nick and Pauline , said they had been watching television at the time .
The girls ' mother said Lola looked " dreadful "
She added : " One side of her face is beautiful .
The other side is like something from a horror movie . "
However , she said the baby was " laughing and smiling at people " .
" Isabella is in special care , she 's not faring as well , " she added .
Joe Lobenstein MBE , 83 , a former civic mayor of Hackney said he had warned the council about foxes in the area in 1993 and in 2000 .
He said : " I wrote that hungry stray foxes are prone to be unpredictable and it seems to me that in a heavily built - up area where there 's a considerable mix of very young and very old people the problem should not be taken lightly .
" The council did not act positively and although I very much commiserate with the family that has had such a terrible accident it was the sort of accident which would one day happen and did happen . "
A spokesman for the council said there were no indications that the borough had more foxes than other areas of London .
Since the incident pest controllers set fox traps in the back garden of the house .
A fox was discovered in one of the traps on Sunday night and was destroyed by a vet .
' Humanely killed '
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " Hackney environmental health officers arranged for traps to be set in the rear garden of the address .
" [ On Sunday night ] a neighbour informed environmental health officers that an animal could be heard in one of the traps .
" A vet was called to establish if it was safe to move the animal .
It was determined it was not and the fox was humanely killed by the pest controller at approximately 12.15 am .
" The traps will remain in situ for the time being . "
John Bryant , a pest control consultant who specialises in foxes , said the attack did not sound like typical fox behaviour .
Mr Bryant , who is an RSPCA Trustee and a member of its Wild Animals Strategy Committee , said : " They will walk into houses , walk round , mess on the bathroom floor and sometimes sleep on the bed if people are not around .
" It just does n't make any sense to me . "
In 2002 , mother Sue Eastwood reported that her baby boy , Louis , was injured when a fox crept into their house in Kent while she slept .
The fourteen - week - old suffered bite marks on his head after the animal darted into the sitting room of the house in Dartford .

The Supreme Court largely affirmed Monday the legitimacy of an accounting regulator created by a post - Enron antifraud law , striking down only a minor provision of the statute .
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was established in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes - Oxley law , which Congress passed after the Enron Corp. scandal exposed a wave of accounting chicanery used by some companies to pump up their stock prices during the late - 1990s bull market .
The board has vast authority over the accounting industry to ensure that auditors do not sign off on questionable financial reporting to curry favor with the companies that hire them .
“ There was the risk that the Supreme Court could have thrown oversight of public - company accounting into complete chaos had it found the existence of the board to be invalid , ” said Jacob Frenkel , a partner at Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy & Ecker in Potomac , Md .

The lawsuit was filed by the nonprofit Free Enterprise Fund and an accounting firm whose auditing procedures had been criticized by the accounting board .
They argued that Sarbanes - Oxley violated the Constitution ’s separation of powers provisions by giving too much power to a board that was not under the direct purview of the president .
The decision avoids a potential headache for the Obama administration , which is pressing forward with a far more sweeping rewrite of the nation ’s securities laws and could have been dogged by questions of constitutionality if the earlier law had been invalidated .
“ I ’m sure the administration is thrilled with the decision , ” said Robert Willens , an accounting expert in New York .
In a 5 - 4 ruling , the justices took issue with a provision of the law barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from firing members of the accounting board except “ for cause . ”

By invalidating that provision , the court gave the SEC the power to remove board members at will , but left intact the rest of the law governing the board .
“ The consequence is that the board may continue to function as before , ” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in the majority opinion .

The formula for “ contrarian ” journalism was aptly summed up by Wonkette ( 1/6/09 ) :
Take a widely accepted belief ( e.g. , “ Dogs make good pets ” ) and write a cool 600 words arguing why its opposite is SECRETLY truer ( “ Why all dogs should die ” ) .
Of course , it helps if the upside - down world you ’re proposing turns out to be one that is surprisingly cozy to powerful corporate interests .
Thus the piece that appeared on the front page of the New York Times today ( 4/4/10 ) arguing that maybe we ’re all a little too worried about that oil spill in the Gulf .
To back up this counterintuitive notion , reporters John Broder and Tom Zeller turn to an “ expert ” :
“ The sky is not falling , ” said Quenton R. Dokken , a marine biologist and the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation , a conservation group in Corpus Christi , Texas .
“ We ’ve certainly stepped in a hole and we ’re going to have to work ourselves out of it , but it is n’t the end of the Gulf of Mexico . ”
Who is this “ conservation group ” minimizing the impact of a massive oil spill on the area it specializes in conserving ?
That ’s what Marian Wang of ProPublica ( 5/4/10 ) wondered , too .
Turns out it ’s not really a conservation group at all :
At least half of the 19 members of the group ’s board of directors have direct ties to the offshore drilling industry .
One of them is currently an executive at Transocean , the company that owns the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded last month , causing millions of gallons of oil to spill into the Gulf of Mexico .
Seven other board members are currently employed at oil companies , or at companies that provide products and services “ primarily ” to the offshore oil and gas industry .
Those companies include Shell , Conoco Phillips , LLOG Exploration Company , Devon Energy , Anadarko Petroleum Company and Oceaneering International .
The Gulf of Mexico Foundation ’s president is a retired senior vice president of Rowan Companies Inc. , an offshore drilling contractor .
Meanwhile , Transocean hosted the group ’s winter board meeting in January and sponsored a dinner for the board of directors .
Past board meetings have been hosted in full or in part by Anadarko Petroleum Company , Shell Exploration and Production , Valero Refinery and Marathon Oil Corporation .
So it ’s not exactly surprising that the executive director of such a group would have a nonchalant view of the impact of oil spills on the Gulf .
What is maybe a little surprising is that the New York Times would present a coalition of offshore drilling interests as neutral experts on the environment .
And it ’s not like the Times reporters did n’t know who they were quoting .
In an addendum to her ProPublica piece , Wang quotes an email response from Zeller :
We were aware of GMF ’s industry partnerships–and for what it ’s worth , I believe they also have members from the agriculture and fishing industries , among others .
As you ’ll note from Dr. Dokken ’s bio , the group also includes marine scientists .
You could certainly mount the argument that such co-mingling might influence his assessment of the oil slick and how bad it might get , but as I understand it , the bulk of GMF ’s operating budget comes from federal and state grants , so that was n’t my sense .
So because the group gets government grants , the Times reporters thought it was n’t worth mentioning that half the group ’s board represents the very industry whose damage to the Gulf is being minimized ?
“ Of course , itÃ ƒ Æ ’Â¢ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¡Â¬ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¾ Â¢s probably always better to err on the side of full disclosure , ” Zeller tells ProPublica–as if revealing that you ’re quoting an industry group speaking in its own defense would be bending over backwards – “ but we operate within space constraints as well –and I believe we did link out to the various websites , so enterprising readers could peruse their boards and sponsors . ”
Here ’s a tip for the Times : Next time you are running into “ space constraints , ” maybe you can free up some room by killing the piece that revolves around an industry spokesperson telling readers not to worry about the damage the industry that employs him has done to the environment .
UPDATE : The New York Times published an Editor ’s Note on May 5 saying that the article “ should have included more information about ” the Gulf of Mexico Foundation : “ While the group says the majority of its funding comes from federal and state grants , it also receives some money from the oil industry and other business interests in the gulf , and includes industry executives on its board . ”
While few readers –“ enterprising ” or not –would realize from that additional info that offshore drilling interests represent half the group ’s board , we suppose it ’s better than Tom Zeller ’s response .

( CNN ) -- During a speech at an event called " Freedom Fest , " former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin warned Tea Party activists that while government spending was a bad thing , conservatives should not go too far and start calling for reductions in the military budget .
While Palin told the crowd in Norfolk , Virginia , " Something has to be done urgently to stop the out - of - control Obama - Reid - Pelosi spending machine , " she also told them , " We must make sure , however , that we do nothing to undermine the effectiveness of our military . "
Palin 's speech touched on a historic problem for the conservative movement .
Ever since conservatives embraced a hawkish stance toward national security policy in the early Cold War in the late 1940s and started to challenge Democrats for not being tough enough , national security has always been the poison pill for anti-government conservatism .
Despite all their rhetoric about the dangers of government intervention and the virtues of private markets , conservatives have rather consistently supported an expansion of the government when it comes to national security .
There was a time when there were prominent conservative voices that were more skeptical .
Ohio Sen. Robert Taft , " Mr. Republican , " tried to prevent the expansion of the national security state after World War II .
Taft opposed President Truman as Truman pushed to grow the government in the fight against communism .
Taft warned that total security was impossible and that if Americans created a garrison state to fight communism , politicians would destroy the " America we are trying to preserve . "
But Taft 's arguments were drowned out by a more hawkish Republican outlook .
The intellectual William Buckley , who founded the National Review in 1955 , argued that conservatives had to " accept Big Government for the duration -- for neither an offensive nor a defensive war can be waged ... except through the instrument of a totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores . "
Buckley wrote that Republicans " will have to support large armies and air forces , atomic energy , central intelligence , war production boards , and the attendant centralization of power in Washington -- even with Truman at the reins of it all . "
Buckley 's National Review became a central outlet for such opinions .
In response to libertarian critics , Buckley explained , " National security is a proper concern for the libertarian because without it he stands to lose -- in this case -- all his freedom . "
Since the 1950s , Republicans have embraced Buckley 's arguments , and the party has championed a strong and expansive national security state .
During the 1980s , President Reagan followed Buckley 's approach .
On the one hand , Reagan railed against Washington when it came to domestic problems , saying , " Government is not the solution to our problem , government is our problem . "
Yet when it came to national security , he acted and sounded very different .
Working with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , Reagan pushed for huge increases in defense spending .
In March 1981 , Reagan proposed the largest military budget since World War II , and for the next four years , defense spending would constitute 30 percent of the federal budget .
Colin Powell -- the senior military assistant to Weinberger , whose nickname was Cap -- later wrote , " The once - feared Cap the Knife had become , to his critics , Cap the Ladle . "
Reagan reversed the trend of declining military spending that Congress had undertaken since 1968 .
Reagan was confident that Americans agreed with this approach : " When I was asked during the campaign about what I would do if it came down to a choice between defense and deficits , I always said national security would come first , and the people applauded every time . "
In truth , once conservatives were in power they also started to expand a good deal of domestic spending as well , sometimes learning to live with the continued power of Democrats on Capitol Hill and other times realizing that constituents , including conservatives , often wanted the very government services that Republicans derided .
While Reagan was president the federal budget continued to grow , Social Security and Medicare were protected -- after Reagan backed off an early effort to cut benefits -- and the number of civil servants increased .
While Republicans were often reluctant in their acceptance of domestic spending , they continued to enthusiastically champion government when it came to national security .
This was where , to the GOP , government was the answer .
Following 9/11 , President George W. Bush relied on government as the solution to the nation 's problems .
In addition to significant increases in defense spending , Bush authorized a massive expansion of executive power in order to provide the federal government more power to fight against terrorist networks .
The Patriot Act ( 2001 ) , for example , vastly enhanced the authority of the government to use wiretaps , to search the material of third parties that possessed records pertaining to suspected terrorists , and to close down fundraising organizations connected with terrorism .
As in Reagan 's presidency , other forms of spending increased as well .
Bush famously passed the largest expansion of Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit , and Republicans passed a big agricultural subsidy measure .
When financial markets crashed in the fall of 2008 , Bush secured a huge federal bailout of Wall Street to create a modicum of economic stability .
Importantly , Democrats have their own inconsistencies .
While the Democratic Party has generally supported using the federal government to deal with economic and social problems , many Democrats have expressed deep distrust of federal officials when it comes to national security .
They have warned that government and military officials act based on their own agenda or in response to the needs of a defense establishment .
But when it comes to Republicans , Palin 's recent comments at the conservative rally show why voters should take right - wing arguments about the dangers of government with a grain of salt .
While conservative activists like to talk about a choice between big government and small government , the real debate is over what kinds of government we must have , what our priorities should be , and where our federal money should be directed .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer .
Commercial whaling has been outlawed worldwide since the mid-1980s , but the ban does not cover smaller marine mammals like dolphins .
Japan kills about 13,000 dolphins a year , according to the Fisheries Agency , of which about 1,750 are captured in Taiji .
Most of those killed in Taiji ’s hunts are bottlenose dolphins , which are not endangered .
The movie has raised passions in the United States , too , though of a far different sort .
After some covert work by the movie ’s producers  timed to coincide with the Oscar ceremonies  investigators raided a sushi restaurant in Santa Monica , Calif. , in March and charged its owners with serving endangered Sei whale .
After an apology , the restaurant soon closed its doors , apparently in an act of gustatory hara - kiri .

Advocates of free speech here have urged theaters to resist the threats and show the documentary , made by the American filmmaker Louie Psihoyos .
Many Japanese are unaware that dolphin hunts take place here , where consumption of dolphin meat is rare , and critics say it is time for a public debate .
A few businesses are resisting the nationalists ’ pressure .
The Internet service company Niwango plans a free streaming of the film on Friday , though for only 2,000 viewers .
But three theaters canceled runs of the film in early June after Mr. Nishimura ’s group warned on its
Web site that it would stage demonstrations outside two theaters in central Tokyo .
Twenty - three others are still mulling whether to show the film .
Not one is currently screening it .
Yoshiyuki Hasegawa , the manager at Yokohama New Theater , said he was postponing screenings of the film .
“ Of course it upsets me , ” he said , “ but I must consider the trouble it would bring to my neighbors . ”
Though the film was never slated for a blockbuster release in Japan , organizers now fear that there will be no run at all .
“ I had a sense of mission , ” said Takeshi Kato , president of the film ’s distributor in Japan , Unplugged .
“ I knew from the moment I watched it that this issue was something the Japanese needed to see and think deeply about . ”

Former US president says Khalid Sheik Mohammed was waterboarded by US and he would do it again ' to save lives '
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
George Bush admitted yesterday that Khalid Sheik Mohammed , the self - proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , was waterboarded by the US , and said he would do it again " to save lives " .
" Yeah , we waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , " the former president told a business audience in Grand Rapids , Michigan .
" I 'd do it again to save lives . "
Waterboarding is a simulated drowning technique that the Obama administration has said is torture .
Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and is the most senior al - Qaida operative in US custody .
In his speech , Bush also defended the decision to go to war with Iraq in 2003 .
He said ousting Saddam Hussein " was the right thing to do and the world is a better place without him " .
But he said he was not tempted to criticise Barack Obama .
" You are not going to see me in the public square criticising the president . "
In February he said he was " trying to regain a sense of anonymity .
I did n't like it when a certain former president made my life miserable . "
This was said to be a reference to Jimmy Carter , president from 1976 to 1980 .
Bush also talked about the role of religion in his life .
" I prayed a lot .
I really did .
I prayed before every major speech .
I prayed before debates .
It was a very important experience . "
And he talked about the morning of 9/11 , describing how he had learned that first one , then two planes had hit the World Trade Centre in New York .
The third plane , which hit the Pentagon near Washington DC , was " a declaration of war on our country " , he said .
Bush 's memoir Decision Points will be published in November .

I ’ve finally recovered from fourth year enough that I feel like coding a serious personal project again .
That project is a turn - based tabletop game I ’m adapting to code , I ’ll go into more detail about it later .
For the interface , I want to do an Ajax - powered web app , and I ’m using Michael Snoyman ’s excellent Haskell web framework , Yesod , to make that happen .
There ’s
Ajax support built into Yesod , but nothing for push updates sent to clients .
In order to prove that Yesod ( and I ) were up to the job , I wrote a basic many - user chat room app .
It uses the fairly standard hack for Ajax push : clients send a dummy request and the server just leaves the connection open , and uses the response as a form of push .
The code , both the Haskell and the Javascript ( uses jQuery ) , follows .
I ’m not going to bother explaining how Yesod works , Michael Snoyman has already done an excellent job of that at docs.yesodweb.com .
This is basically a combination of the Ajax and “ Chat ” ( really a message board ) tutorials from there .
The only tricky part is that the site argument , a read - only parameter passed to request handlers by Yesod , contains a couple of TVars that hold one duplicate of a single TChan for each client ( dupTChan is awesome for this kind of independent - read / broadcast - write application ) .
Clients send an Ajax request to post a message , of course , but they also make a check - in request .
That handler ( getCheckR ) finds that client ’s TChan and blocks until data is available on it , which it then sends to the client .
The clients displays it and makes another check - in request .
That leads me to my question to my readers :
The Javascript function check
In makes an Ajax request whose callback calls check In again .
Is that a safe thing to do ?
Does it leak stack frames ?
It depends , I suppose , on the internals of jQuery ’s implementation , and possibly on the Javascript engine .
If anyone could enlighten me , I would be very grateful .
Edit :
You may have noticed that WordPress mangled the code below .
It ’s also out of date with the modern versions of Yesod .

CAIR slams ‘ KKK tactics , ’ says Tea Party changing focus to ‘ promotion of Islamophobia ’
‘ Islam is not a religion , ’ declares anonymous protest organizer
The Council on American - Islamic relations has condemned plans for a Tea Party protest outside a southern California mosque , whose organizers are urging protesters to bring dogs with them because Muslims “ hate dogs . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
A recent series of unsigned emails and anonymous Web postings has called for a protest during Friday prayers outside the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley , in Riverside County .
Protest organizers are upset at the Islamic group ’s plans to build a new mosque to replace its current makeshift mosque .
One of the emails , obtained by CAIR , declared : “ Islam is not a religion .
It is a worldwide political movement meant [ sic ] on domination of the world .
And it is meant to subjugate all people under Islamic law… . ”
The email goes on to say that Muslims “ hate dogs .
…
Tennessee was able to stop the Mosque so bring your Bibles , flags , signs , dogs and singing voice on Friday . ”
The reference to Tennessee evidently has to do with a controversy over the planned construction of a mosque in Murfreesboro , Tennessee , which has drawn opposition from some residents .
Contrary to the email , planning for the mosque has not been halted .
The identity of the protest organizers “ remains a mystery , ” reports the Los Angeles Times , but the organizers “ appear to be associated with a southwest Riverside County political group affiliated with the ‘ tea party ’ movement . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In a press release , CAIR declared that the protest was being organized by the Southwest Riverside County Tea Party .
Protest supporters “ are being told to bring dogs to harass Muslim worshipers , ” CAIR said .
With the city of Temecula soon to determine whether the proposed mosque can go ahead , opposition to its construction has been growing more vocal .
Opponents told the L.A.
Times last week they feared the mosque would turn the area into “ a haven for Islamic extremists . ”
That ’s a charge denied by members of the Temecula mosque , who point out their current mosque has been operating in Riverside County for more than a decade .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Californians of all faiths should repudiate those who would target a house of worship using tactics specifically designed to cause offense , ” said Hussam Ayloush , executive director of the Los Angeles branch of CAIR .
“ National and state Tea Party leaders should explain why their movement has apparently deviated from its agenda on fiscal responsibility and limited government to the promotion of Islamophobia . ”
CAIR also notes that the organizers ’ assertion that Muslims “ hate ” dogs is wrong .
“ Many Muslims believe the saliva of dogs invalidates the ritual ablution performed before prayer .
For this reason , it has become a cultural norm for individuals not to have dogs in their houses — not because the dog is ‘ hated , ' ” CAIR stated .

Political opposition to the construction of mosques has grown in recent weeks , primarily on the back of the controversy over the construction of a mosque several blocks away from the Ground Zero site in New York City .
A planning commission hearing to determine whether the city will allow the Temecula mosque to be built was scheduled for August 18 , but it has been pushed back to November .

Forsa - Trend FDP stürzt in Umfrage auf fünf Prozent
Die FDP gerät immer tiefer in die Krise : Nach einer neuen Forsa - Umfrage würden nur noch fünf Prozent der Wähler für die Liberalen stimmen .
Der Mittelstand läuft der Partei davon - die Grünen dagegen legen zu .
The staff of Normandy Crossing Elementary School outside Houston eagerly awaited the results of state achievement tests this spring .
For the principal and assistant principal , high scores could buoy their careers at a time when success is increasingly measured by such tests .
For fifth - grade math and science teachers , the rewards were more tangible : a bonus of $ 2,850 .
But when the results came back , some seemed too good to be true .
Indeed , after an investigation by the Galena Park Independent School District , the principal , assistant principal and three teachers resigned May 24 in a scandal over test tampering .
The district said the educators had distributed a detailed study guide after stealing a look at the state science test by “ tubing ” it — squeezing a test booklet , without breaking its paper seal , to form an open tube so that questions inside could be seen and used in the guide .
The district invalidated students ’ scores .
Of all the forms of academic cheating , none may be as startling as educators tampering with children ’s standardized tests .
But investigations in Georgia , Indiana , Massachusetts , Nevada , Virginia and elsewhere this year have pointed to cheating by educators .
Experts say the phenomenon is increasing as the stakes over standardized testing ratchet higher — including , most recently , taking student progress on tests into consideration in teachers ’ performance reviews .
Every few days , tankers freshly laden with crude from Alberta 's oil sands squeeze through the shallow Second Narrows channel in Burrard Inlet , make their way through swift currents in the southern Gulf Islands and on towards offshore markets .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
Vancouver -- the " world 's greenest city " in the words of Mayor Gregor Robertson -- has quietly become a major outflow of what Greenpeace calls " the world 's dirtiest oil . "
This unlikely circumstance has happened with virtually no public debate and is driven by geopolitical forces now converging on the place many regard as the birthplace of the environmental movement .
Those forces include :
China 's hunger for oil and investment in the Alberta oil sands .
Washington 's emerging resolve to regulate against high carbon emitting fuels like the oil sands .
And Ottawa 's resulting desire to find alternative Asian markets for oil sands oil .
Add in stolid First Nations resistance to a proposed pipeline from the tar sands to Kitimat , and all these powerful pressures converge on the aptly named Second Narrows , which already has seen its oil tanker traffic rise precipitously in the past decade .
A $ 200 billion need for new outlets
Vancouver was not envisioned as a major crude oil port .
The pipeline from Alberta to Burnaby and Bellingham , Washington has been in existence since the '50s and originally supplied four refineries in Burrard Inlet with conventional oil from western Canada .
Three of those refineries have since closed .
The current owner of the pipeline , American energy giant Kinder Morgan , recently expanded capacity to 300,000 barrels per day " ... to transport growing volumes of product from Alberta 's oil sands . "
Crude shipments from Vancouver have increased almost tenfold since 2001 .
The occasional transit of surplus crude from Vancouver using comparatively small vessels has now become regular shipments using the largest class of tankers that can navigate the narrow and dangerous confines of Burrard Inlet .
The driver of this transformation is the Alberta oil sands , which saw production climb to 2.72 million barrels of synthetic crude last year .
The vast majority of this oil and bitumen is transported by pipeline to U.S. refineries , where it now supplies eight per cent of domestic demand .
But companies that have so far invested $ 200 billion in northern Alberta remain vulnerable to an almost complete reliance on American markets .
Growing concern about climate change and the election of Barack Obama mean that the enormous carbon footprint of the oil sands may eventually become a cost to producers .
Proposed carbon pricing legislation in the U.S. as well as low carbon fuel standards being adopted by California and other states could make many oil sands projects marginal or entirely uneconomic in future .
A recent assessment by Citi oil analysts warned investors that Alberta syncrude " ... is not a fuel source that sits naturally within a low carbon economy and is unlikely to be a strategic winner as climate regulation tightens , albeit gradually , in North America . "
What to do ?
Increasingly , oil sands investors are looking to China , and China is looking to the oil sands .
China buying stakes in oil sands
This year the Conservative government approved the sale of $ 1.9 billion in oil sands assets to two companies controlled by the Chinese government .
Prime Minister Harper said at the time to " expect more Chinese investment in the resource and energy sectors ... there will definitely be more . "
He was n't kidding .
Another $ 4.65 billion deal this spring will bring Beijing 's investment in the oil sands to $ 7 billion and counting .
China typically buys into resource ventures not merely as an investment , but to feed their ballooning demand for raw materials , and oil is top of their list .
All this means that both oil sands operators and Chinese government now want to expand pipeline capacity through B.C. to the coast .
While much attention has rightly been focused on the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline to Kitimat , local First Nations have made it clear they will seek to block the project .
A long and likely litigious battle began this month when Enbridge applied for regulatory approval .
Which brings us to back to Burrard Inlet -- the only current oil sands access to the ocean .
While it is true that small oil tankers have moved surplus oil out of Second Narrows for decades , it has never been done on this scale -- or using ships that exceed the dimensions of what the Port Metro Vancouver ( PMV ) previously considered safe .
Port has seen freighter slam bridge
Tankers exiting the Kinder Morgan Westridge Terminal in Burnaby must thread the narrow spans of the CN Railway bridge in Second Narrows , only at the highest tides , and only during daylight hours .
The navigable channel here is only 121 metres across and as little as 12 metres deep at zero tide .
The PMV Operations Manual from 2007 states that tankers with a draft up to 12.5 metres can only transit through Second Narrows at a high tide of 14 feet .
These restrictions seem well founded .
The CN Railway bridge has the highest navigational hazard rating designated by the Canadian Coast Guard .
In 1978 , the freighter Japan Erica struck one of the bridge piers , shutting down rail traffic to the North Shore for several months .
This vessel was one fifth the size of tankers now plying Second Narrows , and had a marine pilot on board at the time .
Related Document PMV announcement
The Second Narrows navigation restrictions date back to the 1970s , but are now being rolled back .
In May of last year , PMV announced to the shipping industry changes allowing for tankers to transit Second Narrows with a draft of 13.5 metres ( document available to the right ) .
These new procedures were publicly released in April of this year .
Related Document PRMM report
This new policy was apparently the result of a 2008 Risk Management Assessment ( available to the right ) involving stakeholders only from the shipping industry , though Transport Canada 's methodology for Pilotage Risk Assessments defines stakeholders as " any individual , group , or organization able to affect , be affected by , or believe it might be affected by , a decision or activity . "
B.C. pilots are highly competent and are being trained with tug operators on simulators to deal with the increased challenges of bringing larger vessels through the Second Narrows bottleneck .
That said , the Pacific Pilotage Authority stated in a memo that vessel drafts should be limited to 13 metres until these simulations are proven to " translate to real life . "
AFRAmax tankers such as those moving through Burrard Inlet can have a draft of more than 14 metres when fully loaded and carry up to three times the amount of oil that spilled from the Exxon Valdez .
The Port recently intimated plans to move to bigger Suezmax tankers in the future with a draft of 18 metres , requiring dredging of Second Narrows .
While allowances for larger tankers have changed , the hazardous confines of Second Narrows have not .
The highest tides needed for AFRAmax tankers leave a slack water window of about 20 minutes before Burrard Inlet begins to empty with currents reaching five knots .
A worst case scenario spill in those conditions would flush crude out into the Georgia Strait and eventually throughout the South Coast .
Vancouver -- the hometown of Greenpeace and the " greenest city in the world " -- has quietly become a major outflow for controversial Alberta syncrude .
The global forces driving these changes are converging on a narrow stretch of treacherous water that stands between the oil sands and the world .

Formula 1 teams have agreed a tweak to the sport 's testing regulations to prevent anyone gaining a benefit from using ' filming days ' to try out new parts , AUTOSPORT has learned .
The strict in - season testing ban means outfits are not meant to try out new parts away from a grand prix weekend .
However , some teams - including Mercedes GP with its new engine cover design and Ferrari with its blown diffuser - have this year managed to complete some limiting testing under the guise of a ' filming ' day .
Those runs caused some concern among rival outfits , and teams have spent the last few weeks trying to tidy up the regulations .
Sources have revealed that at last week 's British Grand Prix teams got together to sign off a new testing agreement that will prevent teams from exploiting filming days .
AUTOSPORT understands that with immediate effect , teams will be banned during filming days from running any parts that have not been raced before .
McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh confirmed the changes had taken place , and was pleased that everyone was now in agreement about what was and was not allowed .
" I personally did not feel there was any ambiguity , but others argued that there was , " he said .
" But that is pressure , and when people are under pressure they try and take a different view .
" It is now clear that , if you are doing a demo run , then you must use components that have been raced before - and it has to be a legitimate demo run . "
Although the filming loophole was still open ahead of Silverstone , Whitmarsh revealed that he ruled out his team making use of it for its new blown diffuser , despite some pressure from team members .
" The engineers here said others have done it , why can't we ? " he said .
" My view , as someone trying to hold FOTA together , was that I felt we could not take that advantage . "
India has come up with a 1500 rupee ( $ 39 ) touchscreen laptop - a computing prototype it aims to make available to students from elementary schools to universities .
The gadget , developed by the elite Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Science , is part of a push to give students a better education and technical skills needed to boost India 's economic growth .
The first users are expected to be university students , with introduction of the Linux - based device targeted for next year .
The ministry is going to install broadband internet at all of its 22,000 colleges so students can use the device , government spokeswoman Mamta Verma told AFP on Friday in New Delhi .
The tablet gadget , which can be run on solar power , is equipped with an internet browser , video - conferencing capability and a media player , among other facilities .

The Well from Hell
USCG
Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon , off Louisiana , in this handout photograph taken on April 21 , 2010 and obtained on April 22 , 2010 .
By Christian A. DeHaemer
The Dwarves dug too greedily and too deep .
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad - dum ... shadow and flame .
 Saruman , The Lord of the Rings
There is something primordial about BP 's quest for oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
It 's an Icarus - like story of super - ambition ; of reaching too far , delving too deep .
I do n't know if you 've stopped to contemplate what BP was trying to do ...
The well itself started 5,000 feet below the surface .
That 's the depth of the Grand Canyon from the rim .
And then the company attempted to drill more than 30,000 feet below that 
Mt. Everest would give 972 feet to spare .
Furthermore , the company sought oil in a dangerous area of the seabed .
It was unstable and many think BP sought it out because seismic data showed huge pools of methane gas  the very gas that blew the top off Deepwater Horizon and killed 11 people .
More than a year ago , geologists criticized Transocean for putting their exploratory rig directly over a massive underground reservoir of methane .
According to the New York Times , BP 's internal " documents show that in March , after several weeks of problems on the rig , BP was struggling with a loss of ' well control . '
And as far back as 11 months ago , it was concerned about the well casing and the blowout preventer . 
The problem is that this methane , located deep in the bowels of the earth , is under tremendous pressure ...
Some speculate as much as 100,000 psi  far too much for current technology to contain .
The shutoff vales and safety measures were built for only 1,000 psi .
It was an accident waiting to happen ...
And there are many that say it could get worse  much worse .
Geologists are pointing to other fissures and cracks that are appearing on the ocean floor around the damaged wellhead .
According to CNN :
The University of South Florida recently discovered a second oil plume in the northeastern Gulf .
The first plume was found by Mississippi universities in early May .
And there have been other plumes discovered by submersibles ...
Some geologists say that BP 's arrogance has set off a series of events that may be irreversible .
There are some that think that BP has drilled into an deep - core oil volcano that cannot be stopped , regardless of the horizontal drills the company claims will stop the oil plume in August .
Need the mudlogs
Geologist , Chris Landau , for instance , has called for a showing of the mudlogs .
A mudlog is a schematic cross sectional drawing of the lithology ( rock type ) of the well that has been bored .
So far , no one has seen them ...
BP keeps them hidden .
Mr. Landau claims :
It is a dangerous game drilling into high pressure oil and gas zones because you risk having a blowout if your mud weight is not heavy enough .
If you weight up your mud with barium sulfate to a very high level , you risk BLOWING OUT THE FORMATION .
What does that mean ?
It means you crack the rock deep underground ; as the mudweight is now denser than the rock , it escapes into the rock in the pore spaces and the fractures .
The well empties of mud .
If you have not hit high pressure oil or gas at this stage , you are lucky .
But if you have , the oil and gas come flying up the well and you have a blowout , because you have no mud in the well to suppress the oil and gas .
You shut down the well with the blowout preventer .
If you do not have a blowout preventer , you are in trouble as we have all seen and you can only hope that the oil and gas pressure will naturally fall off with time , otherwise you have to try and put a new blowout preventer in place with oil and gas coming out as you work .
Obviously , the oil and gas pressure has n't fallen off
In fact ... it 's increased .
The problem is that BP may not only have hit the mother of high - pressure wells , but there is also a vast amount of methane down there that could come exploding out like an underwater volcano .
I recently heard a recording of Richard Hoagland who was interviewed on Coast to Coast AM .
Mr. Hoagland has suggested that there are cracks in the ocean floor , and that pressure at the base of the wellhead is approximately 100,000 psi .
Furthermore , geologists believe there are another 4 - 5 cracks or fissions in the well .
Upon using a GPS and Depth finder system , experts have discovered a large gas bubble , 15 - 20 miles across and tens of feet high , under the ocean floor .
These bubbles are common .
Many believe they have caused the sinking of ships and planes in the Bermuda Triangle .
That said , a bubble this large  if able to escape from under the ocean floor through a crack  would cause a gas explosion that Mr. Hoagland likens to Mt. St. Helens ... only under water .
The BP well is 50 miles from Louisiana .
Its release would send a toxic cloud over populated areas .
The explosion would also sink any ships and oil structures in the vicinity and create a tsunami which would head toward Florida at 600 mph .
Now , many people have called Hoagland a fringe thinker and a conspiracy theorist .
And they may be right ...
But that does n't mean he is n't on to something .
EPA finds high concentrations of gases in the area
The escape of other poison gases associated with an underground methane bubble ( such as hydrogen sulfide , benzene , and methylene chloride ) have been found .
Last Thursday , the EPA measured hydrogen sulfide at 1,000 parts per billion  well above the normal 5 to 10 ppb .
Some benzene levels were measured near the Gulf of Mexico in the range of 3,000  4,000 ppb  up from the normal 0 - 4 ppb .
More speculation of doom
The Oil Drum , an industry sheet , recently ran an article about the sequence of events that tried to stop the oil spill .
The upshot of industry insiders was that after trying a number of ways to close off the leak , the well was compromised , creating other leaks due to the high pressure .
BP then cut the well open and tried to capture the oil .
In other words : BP shifted from stopping the gusher to opening it up and catching what oil it could .
The only reason sane oil men would do this is if they wanted to relieve pressure at the leak hidden down below the seabed ...
And that sort of leak  known as a down hole  leak  is one of the most dangerous kind .
No stopping it
It means that BP can't stop if from above ; it can only relieve the pressure .
So , more oil is leaking out while BP hopes it can drill new wells before the current one completely erodes .
BP is in a race against time ...
It just wo n't admit this fact .
According to the Oil Drum :
There are abrasives still present , a swirling flow will create hot spots of wear and this erosion is relentless and will always be present until eventually it wears away enough material to break it 's way out .
It will slowly eat the bop away especially at the now pinched off riser head and it will flow more and more .
Perhaps BP can outrun or keep up with that out flow with various suckage methods for a period of time , but eventually the well will win that race , just how long that race will be ?
...
No one really knows ...
Which leads us back to Mr. Landau 's point about the mudlogs and why BP wo n't release them .
I do n't know ...
Maybe I 'm wearing my tinfoil hat too tight this morning ...
But this stuff seems possible  if it 's only a worst case scenario .
What strikes me as odd is the way the leadership of BP and the Obama administration is acting .
BP is running around apologizing to everyone they can find .
Obama says give us $ 20 billion in escrow and $ 100 million for the people Obama put out of work on the oil rigs due to his six month ban  and BP says , " Sure thing mate , no problem . "
And all of this in a 20 - minute meeting ?
I 've been dealing with oil companies for a long time and it just does n't add up ...
Contrast it , for instance , with the Exxon situation in Alaska or the Union Carbide disaster in India .
Exxon fought tooth and nail for its shareholders ; it appealed court rulings for 19 years .
Union Carbide was n't settled for 25 years .
BP is rolling over like a simpering dog .
Why ?
The only reason I can think of is that the company knows  better if not as well as the Obama administration does  that it will get worse .
Much worse .
I 've put together a list of oil cleanup stocks for the readers of my Crisis & Opportunity .
Many are running , and one has pulled back into a solid buy range .
Three more are on my buy list .
All I know is that this spill is n't even half over .
Oil in the Gulf will lead the news - cycle for the foreseeable future .
And the companies that make products that stop , absorb , or disperse oil have an endless supply of work .
Their share prices have nowhere to go but up .

Article : Swiss Reject U.S. Request to Extradite Polanski
The justice ministry of Switzerland said on Monday that it had denied a request to extradite the director Roman Polanski to the United States , where he has been a fugitive since 1978 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13 - year - old girl , and that he was no longer under house arrest .
In rejecting the extradition request from the United States , the Swiss ministry cited two factors : first , the Swiss said , the United States had failed to provide the records of a January hearing in Los Angeles County Superior Court that would have shown the judge in charge of the Polanski case in 1977 agreed that “ the 42 days of detention spent by Roman Polanski in the psychiatric unit of a Californian prison represented the whole term of imprisonment he was condemned to . ”
Second , the Swiss said , when Mr. Polanski traveled in September 2009 to the Zurich Film Festival where he was arrested as he arrived at the airport , he did so in “ good faith ” that “ the journey would not entail any legal disadvantages for him . ”
The Swiss justice ministry noted that Mr. Polanski had been staying regularly in Switzerland since 2006 , and that though “ he was registered in the Swiss registry of wanted persons , he was never controlled by the Swiss authorities . ”
In a statement , the ministry wrote :
The 76 - year - old French - Polish film director Roman Polanski will not be extradited to the USA .
The freedom - restricting measures against him have been revoked .
This announcement was made by Mrs. Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf , head of the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police , in Berne on Monday .
The reason for the decision lies in the fact that it was not possible to exclude with the necessary certainty a fault in the U.S. extradition request , although the issue was thoroughly examined .
Moreover , also the principles of State action deriving from international public order were taken into account .
At the end of 2005 the U.S. authorities issued an international search warrant against Roman Polanski due to sexual offense against a minor committed in 1977 .
On the basis of this international order of arrest , Roman Polanski was arrested on 26th September 2009 upon his arrival at the airport of Zurich and taken into provisional custody pending extradition .
On 22nd October 2009 the US authorities filed a formal extradition request .
On 4th December Roman Polanski was released from custody after depositing a 4.5 million franc bail and was granted house arrest under electronic monitoring in his chalet in Gstaad .
This is a developing story .

India has been ranked as a “ Tier II Watch List ” country – only one level better than worst - performing Tier III countries such as Saudi Arabia and Zimbabwe – in the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report ( TIP ) compiled by the State Department .
Given the definition of Tier II Watch List in the TIP , this implies that India ranks among those countries whose governments “ do not fully comply with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act ’s ( TVPA ) minimum standards , but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards . ”
Additionally , one of the three following conditions was found in India : first , that the absolute number of victims of severe forms of trafficking was very significant or was significantly increasing ; second , that there was a failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons from the previous year ; or , third , that the determination that India was making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with minimum standards was based on commitments by India itself , to take additional future steps over the next year .
In terms of the definition of trafficking under the TVPA , a person may be a trafficking victim “ regardless of whether they once consented , participated in a crime as a direct result of being trafficked , were transported into the exploitative situation , or were simply born into a state of servitude . ”
The TIP adds that at the heart of this phenomenon are the myriad forms of enslavement including forced labour , sex trafficking , bonded labour debt bondage among migrant labourers , involuntary domestic servitude , forced child labour , child soldiers and child sex trafficking .
While most of South Asia ranks along with India as a Tier II Watch List country , Pakistan is notably ranked as Tier II – one level better than India .
Thus while Pakistan ’s government did not fully comply with the TVPA ’s minimum standards , it was making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with those standards – with none of the three additional conditions found in the case of India applicable to Pakistan .
Most developed countries , but even some developing countries such as Colombia and Nigeria , were ranked as Tier I countries in the TIP , that is countries whose governments fully complied with the TVPA ’s minimum standards .
Commenting further on the case of India , the TIP noted that the Government of India “ does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking ; however , it is making significant efforts to do so , particularly with regard to the law enforcement response to sex trafficking . ”
Yet , the TIP argues , the Indian government did not demonstrate sufficient progress in its law enforcement , protection , or prevention efforts to address labour trafficking , particularly bonded labour .
“ Therefore India is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the seventh consecutive year , ” the report said .
The TIP also noted that there were few criminal convictions of forced labour during the reporting period and police raids of brick kilns , rice mills , factories , brothels , and other places of human trafficking were usually prompted by NGO activists , as were efforts to provide rehabilitation and protective services to the victims removed from human trafficking .
Further , national and state government anti-trafficking infrastructure , and the implementation of the Bonded Labour ( System ) Abolition Act ( BLSA ) , “ remained weak , ” the TIP observed , and the number of government shelters increased but some continued to be of poor quality .
Some public officials ’ complicity in trafficking remained a major problem , the report noted .
Dow Theorist Richard Russell on the psychology of Bear markets :
1 ) The first phase is the one where the bear market wipes out the optimism and excitement which existed at the preceding bull market ’s top .
I believe we are in the first phase of the bear market now .
2 ) The second phase of a bear market is usually the longest phase .
This is the phase where it gradually dawns on stock holders that business is deteriorating and that we are moving into hard times .
I believe we are now close to the second phase .
3 ) The third phase of a bear market is the “ throw ’em in ” phase where stocks are sold for no other reason than that the sellers need to raise cash .
During the latter part of the third phase , blue - chip stocks will sell “ below known value , ” and dividend yields on top - quality blue - chip stocks will climb above 6 % or more .
Investors will turn black - bearish , and we will hear opinions such as “ This is the end of capitalism , ” and “ The nation may not survive . ”
As a pure guess , I think that if or when the Dow breaks below its March 9 , 2009 low of 6547.05 ( and I think it will ) that will mark the end of the second phase of the bear market and the start of the third phase .

Desktop Earth is a small system tray utility that will automate the process of downloading snapshots of the Earth from NASA , complete with snow , cloud cover , and a host of other configuration options .
While the old method merely involved downloading one image over a specified interval , this program lets you choose whether you want cloud cover , which images you 'd like to use for night and day , and where the image is centered .
Best of all , despite the fact that it's a program running in the taskbar , it does n't take up a lot of system resources , so there 's not a big downside to using it .
Whether you do n't want to play around with scripting and the command line , or you 'd just like the enhanced customizability of an app , Desktop Earth is another great way to get a cool moving wallpaper .

" We wanted to raise a generation of heretics , but instead we raised a generation of ignoramuses "
- Berl Katznelson
The average secular Jew in Israel is a sad paradox :
He is Jewish , but does not know how to read Judaism .
He is educated , a worldly person who can quote Nietzsche and Plato , but has given up on himself and his roots long ago .
It took many long years until Katznelson 's words trickled down to the right places , but in Israel 2010 there are quite a few seculars who are aware of the problem and are trying to change the situation .
Renewed interest in Torah ( Photo : Israel Bardugo )
At the heart of Tel Aviv 's southern - most neighborhood , opposite the central bus station , among the dubious businesses and the labor migrants , lays the most secular yeshiva there is .
A stack of books for sale can be found at the entrance to the modest building :
The six orders of the Mishnah , at subsidized prices .
Opposite the books , a young man and woman can be seen leaning over a desk with notebooks .
In Tel Aviv's July heat , the two are wearing short sleeves – not afraid of being exposed before the Jewish materials on their desk .
They are part of the Bina Yeshiva 's pre-military service preparatory program .
Omer Sheli , 19 , signed up for the Bina course for the Jewish education .
His parents were indifferent to tradition – sometimes they had Shabbat dinner , and sometime they did n't .
He also never showed interest in Jewish studies until he reached high school and registered for a new course – Jewish heritage .
There , with his Jewish heritage teacher , he came to understand just how little he knows .
Today , 10 months later , he feels different .
" I am no longer an ' empty vessel , ' I have undergone a process .
I feel that I have formed a Jewish identity , I have created for myself mental strength that I did not think was possible . "
Gal Amoyal , 19 , is Omer 's classmate at the yeshiva .
Gal was brought up in a completely secular home , where holidays were celebrated only as a family event .
She was originally interested in philosophy .
Bible studies at her school were minimal and the option of signing up for a course on Jewish heritage did not exist .
She said she also went through a deep process .
" When I arrived here , my interest was based on my anger towards what I knew about Judaism .
Today I feel like have not fully exhausted anything yet .
I am not satisfied ; I still have something to strive to , " she said .
' Shake dust off of Judaism '
Omer and Gal are upset that the society from which they emerged is shut off from the Jewish world .
They disagree with the conservatism .
Not the religious conservatism , but the seculars ' conservative approach .
" I do n't mind the lack of knowledge , but I do not understand the intolerance towards Judaism , " said Omer .
" In the past year , I have discovered that secular society is conservative .
The religious have their own values , norms and red lines that we like to criticize , but the seculars are the same .
They are not willing to give up on what they know . "
The secular yeshiva students occasionally attend classes with students from religious yeshivas , who support bridging gaps .
Gal and Omer speak of the praise they have won for their ability to learn .
They still have far to go in order to close gaps vis -à - vis the other students , but now they already know what they have yet to learn .
" Secularism today is at an all - time low , " Eran said .
" There is a great void and the only answer is to shake the dust off of Judaism , to unearth Katznelson , Rachel the Poetess and Brenner , and build secular yeshivas , and lots of them , all over Israel . "
According to Eran , secular Judaism is social Judaism , a form of Tikkun Olam , which is why he placed his students in the darkest part of Tel Aviv .
This is why they volunteer to help anyone under the biblical definition of " foreigner " or temporary resident of this land .
" We are not trying to invent anything new , just restore , " he explained .
" We are facing an existential crisis because someone decided to have a monopoly over Judaism . "
' Alternative for seculars '
In Jerusalem , two friends in their 30s , " who are in love with the city despite its negative image , " are working on a secular yeshiva of their own .
" We are in the midst of a very serious leadership crisis in Israeli society , " said Avishay Wohl , a teacher and graduate of the Institute for Teacher Training for Humanistic - Jewish Education .
" There are large economic gaps as well as social alienation in the country .
And if that 's not enough , we also see a trend of religious radicalization on the one hand , and contempt for Jewish tradition on the other hand .
We decided to offer an alternative for seculars who are interested in Judaism , in Jerusalem of all places . "
Three years ago Avishay began organizing study and poetry sessions at his home .
These gatherings turned into a success story .
Avishay , along with his friend from university , Ariel Levnison , 31 , decided to take it one step further – to open a yeshiva .
Unlike the secular seminaries meant to acquaint the uneducated and the ignorant with scripture , they hope for a revival – creating Jewish dialogue , writing about Jewish subjects and not bowing down to ultra-orthodox Judaism .
In order to reach such a point , one must study , and a lot .
Avishai and Ariel 's curriculum looks like a basic training crash course for yeshiva boys .
Studies continue from eight in the morning until eight at night .
After that , members of the yeshiva take part in community work .
Mati Hai , 55 , is a Jewish activist and one of those few people familiar to anyone engaged in secular Judaism .
Mati grew up in a home with a devout father and mother who turned secular as result of the Holocaust .
Perhaps this is why it 's easier for him to shift between the religious and secular worlds .
Mati scampers around pre-military schools , Jewish research and philosophy institutes , and meetings between religious and secular Israelis while trying to explain that Judaism is not merely a religion .
" Judaism is also about culture and a world of morality , values , tradition – and also , among other things , religion , " he says .
In his view , the difference between a religious and a secular person has to do with the number of answers .
" A classic religious person believes wholeheartedly that he possesses the truth ; he looks at the secular and knows that he 's wrong .
Meanwhile , a classic secular believes that the number of answers in the world is like the number of people .
To my regret , many people out there turned secularism into a religion and now they have only one answer . "
' Finding Judaism in kibbutz '
Kibbutz Beit HaEmek , one of these places where Judaism was shunned , leaving secularism as the only option , is home to Benjamin Yogev , 72 .
For years , he managed the " Holy Day Institute " at Kibbutz Beit HaShita along with Aryeh Ben-Gurion ( the prime minister 's nephew . )
Ben -Gurion sought a way to express his Judaism in the kibbutz framework :
What to do on Friday evening , how to address boys who turned 13 , and how to mark Yom Kippur .
The kibbutz atheists created their own lifecycle while marking the holidays in their own way .
Most Jewish holidays were easy to celebrate without getting involved with Halacha and while staying away from the " Old Jew " image they left behind in the Diaspora .
" Today , you will find Jewish texts in the library of any kibbutz , " Yogev says .
" On the other hand , privatization prompted some kibbutzim to shun community ceremonies on religious occasions .
The holidays have changed . "
Meanwhile , some of the kibbutzim in the Jezreel Valley established synagogues in recent years .
Some Kibbutz members also attend the Oranim College in order to study Torah .
On the last Shavuot holiday , they held nighttime Tikkuim and studied the Scroll of Ruth and other Jewish texts .
The haredim refer to the seculars as " captured babies " – Jews with no Judaism within them who are like empty vessels from the moment they entered the world , and therefore should not be blamed .
However , contemporary free Jews , those who voluntarily chose it , have not been captured or empty of substance for a while now .
They 're simply too few to make themselves heard in a state replete with religious camps and branches like Israel .
( CNN ) --
If the kids become too much to handle , slip 'em a little cold medicine .
It 's an often - repeated joke -- or advice -- that parents share on the playground or on Twitter and Facebook pages .
One mom , Jill Smokler , said she does n't vilify parents who medicate their kids : " It 's not the end of the world . "
" It 's certainly better than being pushed to edge , spanking a child or slamming doors or really losing it , " she said .
But drugging children with over - the - counter or prescription medications can have unintended consequences , said the author of a research published Thursday , who likened the practice to child abuse .
The research , published in the Journal of Pediatrics , found an average 160 annual cases in which pharmaceutical drugs were maliciously used on children .
" We believe the malicious use of pharmaceuticals may be an under - recognized form and / or component of child maltreatment , " wrote the author , Dr. Shan Yin , a pediatrician .
Using information from the National Poison Data System , Yin found that children were most commonly receiving analgesics , stimulants / street drugs , sedatives , hypnotics , antipsychotics and cough or cold medications .
He found 1,439 cases from 2000 to 2008 .
Of those , 14 percent resulted in injuries , and 18 children died .
More than half of the cases involved at least one sedating drug ; 17 of the 18 deaths included sedatives .
Yin said the poison data most likely underestimates the actual number of cases .
The circumstances around the 18 deaths were not clear , Yin said .
He did not have access to case notes and legal findings .
Four of them were ruled as homicides , three resulted in legal action against the mother , two were noted as highly suspicious and one included cocaine .
Why young children were given drugs such as antidepressants , stimulants and antipsychotics were also unclear .
The motives , he said , could widely vary , such as overwhelmed parents looking for a break , amusement or punishment .
" Anytime you 're giving a medication for any other purpose other than for what it 's explicitly prescribed for , you run the risk of harming your child , " Yin said .
This year , a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to life in prison after she was found guilty in the death of her 4 - year - old daughter , whose blood had a lethal level of a hypertension drug used to sedate children with ADHD .
Her husband , who was tried separately , was convicted of first - degree murder , according to CNN affiliate NECN .
The prosecutors had argued the father had either given the pills or ordered his wife to do so to silence the child .
In a 2005 case , a Montana day care owner was convicted of killing a 1 - year - old after giving a fatal dose of cough medicine to put the child to sleep .
In extreme cases such as these , the law determines whether the parent or caregivers ' actions are criminal , said Dr. Lawrence Diller , who practices behavioral - developmental pediatrics in Walnut Creek , California .
But in more ordinary , everyday circumstances , the ethical boundaries are hazy .
" There are really ambiguous situations where the line is between helping the child legitimately -- those are the vast majority -- and situations that border on sedating the child that would be a form of abuse , " Diller said .
Parents may slip their children some medication to relax and think they 're not harming them .
This happens to families when " they feel overwhelmed or desperate , " he said .
Each case has different elements and motives , so it's hard to generalize whether deliberate medicating of a child is abuse , said James Hmurovich , the president and CEO of Prevent Child Abuse America .
" If it 's for medical a reason , that 's one thing , " Hmurovich said .
" If moms are at wit 's end and the stress is building up and they 're tired , that 's not a good use of over - the - counter medications . "
Some parents use drugs to calm their children down in airplanes .
Smokler gave her daughter , who was then 1 1/ 2 years old , some Benadryl , expecting her to sleep through the two - hour flight .
Her plan backfired .
Benadryl , an antihistamine used to relieve irritated eyes , sneezing and a runny nose , had an energizing effect on her daughter .
The toddler ran through the aisles , talked as loudly as she could , and jumped up and down on her chair .
" It was worst - case scenario , " said Smokler , of Baltimore , Maryland .
" This is what I get for trying to dope up my kid . "
She never tried it again .
Smokler has discussed using Benadryl on kids with her friends and said it could be seen as a way to have " me time " to relax , read a book or have a quiet dinner .
" It 's a selfish act doing that , " said Smokler , who blogs at Scary Mommy , where she takes a frank look at motherhood .
" Sometimes you just need it .
It 's better than screaming at a kid when all your buttons are being pushed .
You need a break ; it 's a survival mechanism . "
Cynthia Dermody , a health editor for a mom blog , The Stir , said in the typical , real - mom world , parents joke about giving children Benadryl but do n't usually go through with it .
" I 'll admit I 've felt that inclination , too , when my kids were younger and were n't sleeping well .
... I would never give my own children a medication for a nonmedical use , but as a harried , stressed - out parent , I do understand the temptation . "
Sometimes , parents need a break or want their kids to sleep a little longer or sleep at all , she added .

If you listen to the announcement before every panel at Comic Con , video recording is strictly prohibited and all of the footage shown is meant to be for the Hall H audience and the Hall H audience alone .
But that does n't mean that every year somebody does n't decide to take the video and spread it across the web , and that is just what has happened with this year 's most anticipated footage : Kenneth Branagh 's Thor .
Someone has posted a copy of the five minute plus trailer to MegaVideo , believing in the democracy of footage .
Surprisingly , the quality is quite high and is not simply someone recording it on a cell phone ( which would n't have worked due to the fact that it was all in 3D ) .
It wo n't be around long so watch it now and enjoy it while it lasts .
Unfortunately Paramount has done a pretty good job of nuking this trailer out of existence .
Every conceivable copy of it has been scrubbed from the internet .
We 'll let you know as soon as it becomes available again .

Here 's what 's left of our descriptions of the trailer 's contents , after the studio's lawyers had their way with them :
At the end of Iron Man 2 S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Coulson is called to New Mexico where he finds
Thor ’s hammer , Mjolnir , buried deep into the desert floor .
Because nobody can move the hammer other than it ’s rightful owner , but knowing that it ’s an item that needs to be protected , S.H.I.E.L.D. builds a base around the object to protect it .
As we see in the trailer , however , nobody comes between a Norse God and his weapon .
This is the Hall of Asgard , which contains Odin ’s throne .
In the trailer , Odin discusses succession with his brash son , Thor , and announces that he is not yet ready to bestow the crown upon his head because of his arrogance .
After taking away
Thor ’s powers , Odin casts the God of Thunder to Earth to learn humility .
I ’ve included this picture just as a way to appease the fans .
While he obviously does n’t wear it all the time and the film has replaced long , white feathers with metal ones ,
Thor does wear a winged helmet in the film .
Much like Arthur is the only one who can pull the sword from the stone , Thor is only able to remove Mjolnir from the Earth after he has learned his lesson .
This scene , in which he breaks into the S.H.I.E.L.D. base , takes out a bunch of guards and tries to remove the hammer , obviously comes early in the film , as he has obviously not gotten rid of his impetuous ways .
Those looking at the Thor series from the outside in may be familiar with names such as Thor , Loki and Odin by this point , but there are other important Asgardians to know .
For starters there is Sif and the Warriors Three , Fandral , Hogun , and Volstagg ( played by Jaimie Alexander , Joshua Dallas , Tadanobu Asano , and Ray Stevenson ) .
All four are Gods of Asgard and it ’s sworn protectors .
They fight on the side of Thor , though , in the scene pictured , are bowing down to Loki who has just been named their ruler .
Next is this charming looking fellow .
Played by Idris Elba , this is Heimdall .
The character is the brother of Sif and the first line of defense for Asgard .
Standing guard on the rainbow bridge , he watches to ensure that the world is never attacked .
He has earned this position due to his extremely skilled senses and strength .
It ’s entirely possible I am wrong about this one ( please be gentle in the comment section ) , but what I believe we see here is Loki approaching the cosmic cube .
Mentioned during the Captain America scene that was also shown at the Marvel panel , the cosmic cube bestows the greatest power in the universe upon its holder : the ability to bend reality .
While it would n’t be so bad for a person on the side of good to be holding this mythical artifact , trusting someone like Loki with it is as bad an idea as you can have .
Those walking the exhibition hall of the San Diego Convention Center have seen this guy before , known as The Destroyer , but here we get to see it in motion for the first time .
A suit of armor forged by Odin , it is a weapon of extreme power that Loki has used on many occasions to try and destroy Thor .
In addition to extreme strength and the ability to shoot energy blasts , the suit can also manipulate matter and take flight .
Needless to say , it ’s not exactly easy for Thor to take this bad boy down .

( CNN ) --
It 's a big day for the porn industry .
On Friday , ICANN , the not - for - profit corporation that coordinates the internet 's naming system , voted to allow the application of the controversial " .xxx " top - level domain name for sites that display adult content .
The domain , which would need further approval before going live on the internet , would be applied to adult entertainment sites just as " .com " is now .
The .xxx internet suffix , which was first proposed six years ago by ICM Registry , a group that sells domain names , " will provide a place online for adult entertainment providers and their service providers who want to be part of our voluntary self regulatory community , " according to that company 's news release .
Adopting .xxx will be optional .
However , some tech blogs speculate a push to make the domain mandatory for adult - only sites .
ICM Registry has already taken 110,000 pre-reservations for the domain , which could be available in early 2011 , if not sooner , its news release states .
While the company says labeling adult content online " will allow for simple and effective filtering for those who wish to do so , " not everyone is pleased with ICANN 's decision to approve the domain .
Some people involved in the industry are hesitant to accept the domain , " fearing it will lead to censorship , as it would be very easy to block the entire domain instead of individual sites , " Rick Johnson of Portfolio.com wrote Thursday .
On the other hand , " some religious groups are against the creation of the domain , as it would lend more legitimacy to the adult entertainment industry , " he wrote .
What do you think of the " .xxx " top - level domain ?
Is it necessary ?

Chinese factories now compete to woo laborers ( chinadaily.com.cn )
Updated : 2010-07-14 15:59
China 's manufacturing industry is facing a worker shortage that is forcing employers to compete for new workers and prevent seasoned ones from leaving for better salaries , said an article in the New York Times on July 12 .
The article revealed that many factories in Guangdong 's Zhongshan are " operating with vacancies of 15 to 20 percent , " " compelling some bosses to cruise the streets in their BMWs and Mercedeses " in a desperate move to hire workers .
The shortage of workers showed two realities , one of which is " the supply of workers 16 to 24 years old has peaked and will drop by a third in the next 12 years thanks to the family - planning policies , " said the article , and the other is that " young Chinese factory workers , raised in a country with rapidly rising expectations , are less willing to toil for long hours for appallingly low wages like dutiful automatons . "
The article quoted Guo Yuhua , a sociologist at Tsinghua University , as saying that these young workers were " better educated , Internet - savvy and covetous of the urban niceties they discovered after leaving the farm . "
They do not want to go back to being farmers .
Stanley Lau , deputy chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Industries , said in the article that he had been " advising factory owners to offer better salaries , to treat employees more humanely and to listen to their complaints . "
He added that " the young generation thinks differently than their parents , they have been well protected by their families , and they do n't like to ' chi ku . ' "
Although " chi ku , " or eat bitterness , is a " time - honored staple of Chinese culture , " for young people , it is no longer " the badge of honor that an older generation wore with pride , " said the article .
It added that " one factor in the expanding consciousness of migrant laborers is an astounding rise in education . "
Lin Yanling , a labor specialist at the China Institute of Industrial Relations , believed that " a growing number of young people are ambitious , optimistic and more aware of their rights , " and their cellphones , e-mail and Internet chat " connect them to peers in other factories . "
" When they bump against unfair treatment , they are less afraid to challenge authority , " she said .
No , the photo above is n't a scene from the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
It 's a shot taken Monday at London 's Tate Britain , where protesters have staged a mock oil spill to protest the gallery 's acceptance of BP sponsorship .
According to reports from BBC News , a group called the Good Crude Britannia is demanding that the gallery cut its ties with the company over the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf .
The group used a substance resembling oil to stage the mock spill , then covered the scene with bird - like feathers .
( One report identified the thick black substance as molasses . )
BP has numerous ties with cultural institutions in the U.K .
A recent article in the Guardian stated that the oil company has partnerships with the British Museum , the Tate galleries , the Royal Opera House , the National Portrait Gallery , the Almeida Theatre , the National Maritime Museum and the Science and Natural History Museums .
On Monday , the Guardian published a letter signed by numerous artists and cultural figures protesting BP 's involvement with the Tate Britain .
" These relationships enable big oil companies to mask the environmentally destructive nature of their activities with the social legitimacy that is associated with such high - profile cultural associations , " stated the letter .
Here are more images from the mock oil spill at the Tate Britain ...

In this June 8 , 2010 photo , Paul Rodriguez orders in the drive - through lane at In - N - Out Burger in Baldwin Park , Calif .
Amid complaints of obesity and lines of idled cars stretching into neighborhood streets , the town is banning new drive - throughs .
BALDWIN PARK , Calif . ( AP ) 
The birthplace of California 's drive - through craze has had its fill of fast food restaurants .
Amid complaints of obesity and lines of idled cars stretching into neighborhood streets , this blue - collar town is banning new drive - throughs in hopes of shedding its reputation as a haven for convenient , fatty foods .
It 's an ironic development for a community that proudly claims to have opened California 's first drive - through restaurant more than 60 years ago — a little joint named , appropriately enough , In - N - Out .
" We here in Baldwin Park have taken strides to create a healthy community , and allowing one more drive - through in is not going to meet that goal , " said Baldwin Park city planner Salvador Lopez , who helped craft the ordinance that takes effect Fourth of July weekend .
Lopez estimates the town 's drive - throughs and liquor stores outnumber sit - down restaurants and grocery stores six to one .
And with 90,000 people crammed into 6.5 square miles , this suburb east of Los Angeles is concerned that its 17 drive - throughs are causing traffic jams stretching outside its parking lots .
Still , this being the semiofficial birthplace of the drive - through fast - food movement , not everyone is happy with the ordinance .
" They ought to put in more drive - throughs , not stop them , " said Isaac Colin immediately after ordering burgers and fries for himself and his wife , Christine , at the Baldwin Park In - N - Out .
" It 's a waste of time getting out of your car , finding a parking spot , going in , ordering your food . "
Maybe cities in other states should cut back on drive - throughs , he said , conceding they might cause traffic problems .
" But not here .
This is California , " he said .
The restaurant he stopped at is a shrine of sorts to drive - through aficionados , located literally a stone 's throw from where the original In - N - Out , the one believed to be California 's first such eating emporium , was erected in 1948 .
" I used to eat at that one , it was right over there , " said another customer , Trinidad Zuniga , as he pointed to Interstate 10 , the mammoth freeway that runs from the California coastline to Jacksonville , Fla .
That modest first stand , which had no tables or chairs , was torn down some years ago to make way for the freeway .
And although there is no authoritative record - keeping outfit to say it really was California 's first drive - through chow palace , In - N - Out says it was and that 's good enough for pretty much everyone here .
" Definitely it was the original , " said Mayor Manuel Lozano .
" It 's one of our icons . "
Nevertheless , Lopez said , the city needed to cap the drive - through craze that In - N - Out started so many years ago .
The City Council , following the lead of several Canadian municipalities that in recent years have restricted drive - throughs , voted unanimously last month to put a nine - month moratorium on opening any more drive - through restaurants .
That same week , officials opened an outdoor fitness center they say will be dedicated to fighting childhood obesity .
The changes are being welcomed by some residents .
" To be honest , yeah , we have too many drive - throughs , " said Fabian Olguin .
He works at the barbershop across the street from the In - N - Out and says he 's seen traffic back up from its drive - through onto neighboring residential streets .
" Sometimes I can't even get out on the street , " he said , adding when that happens he 'll walk over to get his fast - food fix from the restaurant 's sit - down section .
The ordinance will take effect on a busy holiday weekend when people begin pulling into their local drive - throughs in huge numbers , loading up on things like burgers and fries to take to the beach , said Daniel Conway , a spokesman for the California Restaurant Association .
At this point Conway says his industry group is n't worried it will start a statewide trend .
Just about the same time Baldwin Park adopted its moratorium , the city of San Juan Capistrano , where In - N - Out has been looking to put a restaurant , moved to ease similar restrictions it put in place several years ago .
" I think , " Conway said with a laugh , " that the drive - through is in Californians ' DNA . "

Earlier this year , Chris Solinsky stunned the nation as he shattered the American Record in the 10,000 meters .
Running 26:59 in his debut 10 k , Solinsky became the first ever American under 27 minutes and the fastest ever non-African .
A month later , Solinsky ran 12:56 for 5,000 meters – the 4th American under 13 minutes .
What ’s his training secret ?
Well , hard work .
Solinsky has been diligently training and putting in high - mileage weeks for years , increasing his intensity , and focusing on high - end aerobic development .
Year after year , his training has been consistently high - volume with quality workouts .
While many factors have contributed to Solinsky ’s consistency including core workouts and maximizing recovery time , one aspect of his training that is evident when I watch him race is his incredible efficiency .
Chris Solinsky runs with almost textbook form which has helped him stay healthy and fast .
Five Tips to Improve Your Mechanics
1 ) Keep your back tall .
Remember when your mom told you to stop slouching ?
She was right .
It was n’t right when you were a kid and it ’s not helping you today .
Slouching puts a lot of stress on your legs as you shift your body weight forward .
Avoid this stress and the breaking motion you ’re forcing your body to do by keeping your back tall .
Pretend a string is pulling you up from the top of your head .
You can lean slightly forward – but do n’t lean from the waist .
Lean from your ankles – your entire body should be leaning forward instead of just at the waist .
2 ) Midfoot or Heel strike ?
I used to think that if you ’re landing on your heels then your body is experiencing a braking motion mid-stride .
Braking during a run obviously slows you down , but it also amplifies impact forces from landing .
But it depends on the type of heel strike you have ( and trying to change your form can reduce your efficiency ) .
In an ideal world you would land flat footed with your leg ready to spring up into the next phase of the running cycle .
This style of running , often touted as something “ new ” by POSE or Chi running fans ( when in fact it ’s just the correct way to run ) , will reduce impact shocks and make you faster .
This is illustrated clearly in the Running Form Course .
3 ) Where you land on your foot is important , but equally important is where on the ground your foot lands .
Your foot should make contact with the ground underneath your body .
You will likely land just in front of your center of mass but that ’s ok – the point is to not over - stride .
Many new runners try to over - stride and “ reach ” forward with their legs , causing them to land significantly ahead of their center of mass .
Keep your legs underneath your body when you ’re landing and you will drastically reduce those impact forces and improve efficiency .
4 ) Perhaps the most important way to land on your mid-foot underneath your body is to have a quick cadence .
Your running cadence is your stride - rate – or the number of steps you take per minute .
According to legendary coach Jack Daniels ( and many others ) , the cadence to shoot for is 180 steps per minute .
That ’s a good goal , but keep in mind it ’s not a magic number .
You can be a bit less or more than 180 steps per minute .
They key is to increase your cadence by about 5 - 10 % if it ’s less than 160 .
Quick strides place less stress on your legs because the muscular contractions do n’t have to be as forceful .
5 ) To put it all together , a mental trick I use is to always remind myself to run quickly but softly .
With a high stride - rate , I try to run as quietly as possible almost like I ’m a ninja .
I ’ve run up on some dogs and scared them , so I know I must be doing a good job .
If you ’re landing softly , you ’re not slamming your legs into the ground .
Putting it All Together – What Next ?
Proper running form is probably the most overlooked aspect of the sport .
Beginner runners sign up for cookie - cutter training plans that have tempos , long runs , and interval workouts but there ’s no mention of the right way to run .
Would we teach swimming without first teaching the basics of the freestyle stroke ?
Visit any running message board and you ’ll find hundreds of threads about shin splints , achilles injuries , and any other running ailment you can think of .
The problem is that new runners think that anybody can run .
Well , sure .
But not everyone runs well and sometimes it takes a step - by - step approach .
A recent study showed that in trained runners , stride variation was much lower than non-runners .
This seemingly simple study shows that running at a higher level is a skill .
Just as your aerobic capacity and speed need to be continuously worked on , your running form should be constantly improved upon also .
The great part about implementing these running form techniques is that every one is achievable .
Unlike other biomechanical inefficiencies , like over - pronation or low arches which are difficult to fix ( I know , I have both ) , most aspects of good running form can be learned .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
President Obama poses a real and present danger to the Second Amendment , and he ’s working to pack the Supreme Court with justices who will undermine Americans ’ gun rights .
Mr. Obama did n’t fess up to this radical agenda when running for the highest office in the land .
“ I have said consistently that I believe that the Second Amendment is an individual right , and that was the essential decision that the Supreme Court came down on , ” Mr. Obama told Fox News in June 2008 .
Despite the campaign rhetoric , Mr. Obama is appointing judges who strongly oppose that position .
The most recent pick , Elena Kagan , ran much of President Clinton ’s war on guns from 1995 to 1999 .
When Ms. Kagan served as Mr. Clinton ’s deputy domestic policy adviser , she was a feverish proponent of gun control .
From gunlock mandates to gun-show regulations , she was instrumental in pushing anti-gun policies , according to the Los Angeles Times .
Every court nomination counts .
Two years ago , the Supreme Court barely mustered a narrow 5 - 4 majority to strike down the extreme District of Columbia gun ban .
Should Justice Anthony Kennedy or one of the four more conservative justices retire or die while Mr. Obama is in office , the high court likely will undo such narrow victories for the Second Amendment .
While Ms. Kagan was nominated to replace the liberal Justice John Paul Stevens , and thus wo n’t swing the court in a new direction , her being there will necessitate that gun owners concentrate more than ever on fighting outright gun bans .
Ms. Kagan ’s defenders acknowledge her liberal political views but claim that as a judge , the former Harvard Law School dean will somehow manage to separate her judgments from her political opinions .
The hitch is that her legal views correspond with her political views .
When Ms. Kagan clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall , she wrote , “ I ’m not sympathetic ” to the claim that “ the District of Columbia ’s firearms statutes violate [ an individual ’s ] constitutional right to ‘ keep and bear Arms . ’ “
Her memos to Justice Marshall foreshadow an activist judge who would n’t hesitate to fall back on her own personal views to override policy decisions made by elected officials .
She clearly counseled Justice Marshall on how he should rule based upon whether she thought policies made “ sense . ”
Take her advice in the case of Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council , in which an appeals court stopped federal agencies from issuing a permit to build a ski lodge in a national forest .
Ms. Kagan might feel that stopping ski resorts from such building makes “ policy sense , ” but that is n’t the job of a judge .
Ms. Kagan is Justice Sonia Sotomayor ’s soul sister when it comes to gun control .
Last year , during her confirmation hearings , Ms. Sotomayor insisted the Supreme Court had never found that an individual right to self - defense exists .
Two of Justice Sotomayor ’s own appeals court decisions came to the same conclusion .
One ruling denied there is an individual right to self - defense .
In another case , even after the Supreme Court struck down the District ’s gun ban , Judge Sotomayor opined that any restrictions on self - defense would pass constitutional muster so long as politicians who passed it said they had a good reason .
Senators must realize that a vote for Ms. Kagan for the Supreme Court is another vote against gun rights .

Last week , President Barack Obama put new deepwater drilling operations on hold for another six months .
With the Gulf of Mexico spill entering its fifth week , this move was meant to show that the administration is taking a more cautious approach to offshore drilling , after it had announced a vast expansion just weeks before the BP disaster .
Many news accounts on the moratorium extension implied that all deepwater Gulf operations had been shut down .
But that ’s not the case .
The administration is allowing deepwater drilling operations already in production in the Gulf to continue — including some that may pose a greater risk than the Deepwater Horizon .
Exhibit A : BP ’s other major Gulf operation , the Atlantis , which sits 124 miles off the Louisiana coast .
Kenneth Abbott , a project control supervisor BP contracted to work on the Atlantis , and the environmental group Food & Water Watch filed suit against the federal government on May 17 seeking a temporary injunction to force the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) to shut down the platform .
Abbott claims that his contract was terminated shortly after he alerted management to the rig ’s lack of crucial engineering documents in late 2008 .
According to Abbott , the BP Atlantis lacks more than 6,000 documents that are key to operating the rig safely .
Abbott has said that the vast majority of the project ’s subsea piping and instrument diagrams were not approved by engineers , and the safety systems are out of date .
In March 2009 , Abbott took his concerns about the rig to MMS , the Department of Interior office responsible for regulating offshore drilling .
He says the agency requested some of these documents from BP , but failed to seek specific diagrams of key components necessary for ensuring the rig ’s secure operation .
An internal BP email that came out in the course of Abbott ’s dispute refers to the potential for “ catastrophic operator errors ” on the rig due to these lapses .
The suit argues that without these documents , the rig operators “ are flying blind , and have no way to assure the safety of offshore drilling operations . ”
Food & Water Watch began pushing for lawmakers to intervene on the rig back in August 2009 .
A group of 19 Democratic House lawmakers raised concerns about the Atlantis in a letter to MMS in February , noting “ disturbing reports ” of safety lapses and warning of the “ risk of a catastrophic accident . ”
In a May 19 letter , those lawmakers , led by Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D - Ariz . ) , urged Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to call for “ an immediate shutdown [ of the Atlantis rig ] until it can be shown that this platform is operating safely . ”
The Atlantis , which produces 200,000 barrels of oil a day , operates 7,000 feet below the sea surface — 2,000 feet deeper than the Deepwater rig .
That suggests that if a blowout occurred , the Atlantis could release far more oil than the Deepwater well .
“ We are very concerned that the tragedy at Deepwater Horizon could foreshadow an accident at BP Atlantis , ” the House members wrote .
MMS promised House members after their initial letter that the agency would conduct an audit of the Atlantis and issue a report by the end of May .
But that report has been delayed due to the Gulf disaster , according to the agency .
Elizabeth Birnbaum , who served as head of MMS until she resigned amid criticism of the beleaguered agency last month , told a House panel on May 26 that the agency has reviewed operations at the Atlantis and has “ not found anything ” indicating that the rig should be shut down .
But Grijalva believes that the agency may just be inspecting the inadequate paperwork that it has already approved without giving the rig any closer scrutiny .
This contention is also supported by Food & Water Watch , which submitted a Freedom of Information Act request on March 1 to MMS for records related to agency employees conducting inspections of the Atlantis rig ’s subsea documents .
The request was rejected — an MMS FOIA officer stated that the agency does n’t require documentation of the subsea components as they were built .
Food & Water
Watch says that without reviewing those documents , MMS would be unable to truly determine whether or not the rig was safe .
In the past weeks , Obama has repeatedly criticized the “ cozy ” relationship between oil companies and federal regulators .
And the Department of Interior ’s report on the offshore operations calls for new inspection and reporting procedures , tighter enforcement of existing rules , and the development of “ new , faster ways of stopping blowouts in deepwater , ” among other recommendations .
Yet at a Senate hearing last month , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar shrugged off the suggestion that the administration should pause operations that were approved under the same lax system that allowed the Deepwater rig in the first place .
“ We were not going to have those stopped mid-way , ” Salazar told senators .
“ We ’re missing an opportunity , the administration is , by not insisting that production be suspended until we fully investigate the allegations , ” says Grijalva in an interview .
“ There ’s not only urgency to it , but it would be a prudent , politically smart thing for them to do as well . ”
“ It ’s clear to us that while there are problems with the entire industry , BP is probably the worst actor in terms of cutting corners , not having safety procedures , not having the necessary safety tech for operating platforms , ” said Wenonah Hauter , executive director of Food & Water Watch .
“ There should be a review by MMS of all the operating platforms to make sure safety documents and procedures are in place . ”
( A spokesperson for Abbott could not be reached for comment . )
The Center for Biological Diversity has also filed suit against the Department of Interior for granting waivers to the National Environmental Protection Act for Gulf leases , and has signaled that it intends to sue over non-enforcement of both the Marine Mammals Protection Act and Endangered Species Act in the Gulf .
Meanwhile , the group of House members are going to continue to push for a halt on all drilling operations .
Says Grijalva , “ Given the track record of industry and the track record of the agency in charge of oversight , it just seems to be the one safe route to take right now to assure the American people that another catastrophe wo n’t happen . ”
The FreeType development team has released version 2.4 of the rendering library for TrueType and PostScript fonts .
FreeType is used in almost all Linux and open source Unix systems .
The latest version is also much more stabile when dealing with broken or damaged font files .
The most important change is probably the demise of legal hurdles to using the bytecode interpreter for TrueType fonts .
The interpreter significantly improves representation of TrueType fonts , but had been under patent protection .
Consequently , activating the bytecode interpreter for TrueType fonts had previously required the corresponding compile option to be explicitly activated when compiling the library .
Because global patents expired in May , Libfreetype version 2.4 and later will now compile with the bytecode interpreter activated by default .
This will admittedly not affect users directly , since most Linux distributions have long supplied Libfreetype with the bytecode interpreter activated .

A huge fireball has been spotted on Jupiter in yet another collision from space caught on camera and video by amateur astronomers .
The new Jupiter crash occurred on June 3 at 20:31 UT ( 4:31 p.m. Eastern Time ) and was spotted by skywatcher Anthony Wesley in Australia and fellow amateur astronomer Christopher Go in the Philippines .
Wesley 's photos show the Jupiter fireball blazing in the atmosphere of the gas giant planet .
So far , no visible scar in the clouds has been reported from the event .
IN PICTURES : By Jove , it 's Jupiter
Wesley described the event as a " large fireball " on his website , where he posted the photos taken from Broken Hill , Australia .
This new impact on Jupiter comes less than a year after a spectacular crash on July 19 , 2009 , when what scientist now think was an asteroid about 1,600 feet ( 500 meters ) wide slammed into the planet .
That collision created a massive bruise the size of the Pacific Ocean .
[ Gallery : Jupiter gets smacked . ]
RELATED : Jupiter got smacked again !
It was Wesley , too , who first spotted the July 2009 collision .
His observations kicked off an international observation campaign to study the impact site .
Astronomers initially suspected a comet in last year 's impact , but announced this week that a rogue asteroid was the most likely culprit .
And Jupiter has been smacked before .
In 1994 , the comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 broke into more than 20 pieces and pelted Jupiter repeatedly .
At the time , astronomers estimated such impacts could occur on Jupiter every 50 to 250 years .
So they were surprised by the July 2009 impact .

Die 2006 gegründete Gruppierung habe mit der Steigerung ihrer Mitgliederzahl von etwa 1000 auf rund 12 000 während des vergangenen Jahres eine „ ganz hervorragende Ausgangsbasis “ für die nächsten Landtagswahlen geschaffen , sagte Parteichef Jens Seipenbusch in Bingen .
„ Wir wollen in die Parlamente drängen . “
Auch die Bundestagswahl 2013 werde ins Visier genommen .
Seipenbusch wurde am Abend mit 52,6 Prozent der Stimmen im Amt bestätigt .
Dabei setzte sich der Physiker aus dem nordrhein- westfälischen Münster gegen sieben Gegenkandidaten durch .
In Bingen am Rhein waren rund 1000 Mitglieder zum zweitägigen Bundesparteitag zusammengekommen .
Dabei stand neben der Wahl des Bundesvorstands vor allem die umstrittene inhaltliche Ausrichtung der jungen Partei auf der Tagesordnung .
Bislang widmete sie sich in erster Linie Themen rund ums Internet .
Zur Debatte standen mehr als 300 Anträge zur Ergänzung von Parteiprogramm und Satzung .
Die Forderungen reichten von der „ Entkriminalisierung von Marihuana “ bis zur Ablehnung von Auslandseinsätzen der Bundeswehr .
Jedes Mitglied hat Antrags - und Stimmrecht .
Seipenbusch sagte , zwar seien die 1,5 Prozent Stimmenanteil der Piratenpartei bei der nordrhein - westfälischen Landtagswahl vor einer Woche den eigenen Erwartungen „ zugegebenermaßen nicht gerecht geworden “ .
Der 41 - jährige Informationstechnologie - Spezialist verwies aber auch auf die 2 Prozent bei der Bundestagswahl 2009 .
Zudem sitze die Partei mit einem bundesweiten Altersdurchschnitt von 28 bis 29 Jahren in den Kommunalparlamenten von Aachen und Münster .
Auch sei nun die Schwelle überschritten , von der an die Piratenpartei Mittel aus der staatlichen Parteienfinanzierung erhält .
An app distributed by Google 's Android Market has collected private data from millions of users and forwarded it to servers China , validating Apple 's uniquely strong stance on mobile security in the iPhone App Store .
The exploit , tied to an app that appeared to simply load free custom background wallpapers , was downloaded " anywhere from 1.1 million to 4.6 million times .
The exact number isnât known because the Android Market doesnât offer precise data , " according to a report by Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat .
The app " collects a userâs browsing history , text messages , your phoneâs SIM card number , subscriber identification , and even your voice mail password .
It sends the data to a web site , www.imnet.us.
That site is evidently owned by someone in Shenzhen , China , " the report noted ( see the update by Lookout below ) .
The data upload was only discovered afterward , through forensics performed by mobile security firm named Lookout which sells virus and malware protection software for Android , Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices .
The problem was announced at the Black Hat security conference being held in Las Vegas .
( Update : Lookout has clarified in followup comments with AppleInsider that the intent of their " App Genome Project " research was to " identify security threats in the wild and provide insight into how applications are accessing personal data and other phone resources . "
The group noted that the Android wallpaper app was " not proven to be malicious , " but that the app does " ask the user for specific information around the phone details and that information is transferred to a server [ in China ] . "
Correcting the original VentureBeat story , Lookout stated that " the apps from these developers send several pieces of sensitive data to a server , including a deviceâs phone number , subscriber identifier , and currently programmed voicemail number .
The applications we analyzed did not access a deviceâs SMS messages , browsing history , or voicemail password ( unless a user manually programmed the voicemail number on the device to include the voicemail password ) . "
Lookout also reiterated there is " no proof of malicious intent and in the past apps have been a bit overzealous in getting access to sensitive data with no ill intent . "
Lookout compared the Android wallpaper app copying local data to a Chinese server with a recent App Store title that purported to be a flashlight app while actually including a hidden SOCKS proxy that could be used for tethering .
Lookout added that it has n't " yet " published a report detailing the Android wallpaper app , suggesting that it is continuing to look at the situation . )
Mobile data theft on the increase
The issue recalls a recent AT&T website leak that could hypothetically have enabled a malicious hacker to access 144 thousand of iPad 3G user 's email addresses .
However , the Android app data theft was actually perpetrated by malicious hackers and not just demonstrated by researchers ; it involves far more sensitive data ; and affected far more victims — by more than an order of magnitude .
iOS vs Android in app security
Apps on any platform can access personal data and forward that data to an external server , but the Lookout research found that 47 percent of the selection of Android apps it looked at incorporated third party code ( which may include malicious functions ) , while only 23 percent of analyzed iPhone apps did .
Apple also approves iOS apps through a strict vetting process before listing them in the App Store , while Google 's Android Market app security involves simply warning the user that an app needs permissions to perform certain functions during the install .
Unlike other mobile platforms secured by Lookout , Apple 's iOS platform does n't have a live virus problem because third party iPhone apps can only be distributed through Apple 's curated App Store , and apps are forced to run in a segregated sandbox environment where they can't infect the system .
That does n't necessarily mean iOS apps can't forward user data inappropriately however ;
Apple has discovered and pulled apps that have violated its privacy policies .
Apps must also be signed by a certificate created by Apple , which makes it much harder for malicious developers to anonymously distribute software designed to cause problems or steal data .
Apple 's security measures also make such efforts less attractive financially , despite the iOS platform 's installed base being much larger than Android's .
Exploitable vulnerabilities in the iOS platform have been reported elsewhere , including the Safari browser , but crafting a malicious attack via the browser requires luring users to a malicious site rather than simply distributing a bad app that appears to be useful and genuine .
This page presents a variety of calculations for lati­tude / longi­tude points , with the formulas and code fragments for implementing them .
All these formulas are for calculations on the basis of a spherical earth ( ignoring ellipsoidal effects ) – which is accurate enough * for most purposes …
[ In fact , the earth is very slightly ellipsoidal ; using a spherical model gives errors typically up to 0.3%1 – see notes for further details ] .

Distance
This uses the ‘ haversine ’ formula to calculate the great - circle distance between two points – that is , the shortest distance over the earth ’s surface – giving an ‘ as - the - crow - flies ’ distance between the points ( ignoring any hills they fly over , of course ! ) .
Haversine
formula : a = sin ² ( Δφ / 2 ) + cos φ 1 ⋅ cos φ 2 ⋅ sin ² ( Δλ / 2 ) c = 2 ⋅ atan2 ( √ a , √ ( 1−a ) ) d = R ⋅ c where φ is latitude , λ is longitude , R is earth ’s radius ( mean radius = 6,371 km ) ;
note that angles need to be in radians to pass to trig functions !
JavaScript : const R = 6371e3 ; // metres const φ 1 = lat1 * Math .
PI/180 ; // φ , λ in radians const φ 2 = lat2 * Math .
PI/180 ; const Δφ = ( lat2 - lat1 ) * Math .
PI/180 ; const Δλ = ( lon2 - lon1 ) * Math .
PI/180 ; const a = Math.sin( Δφ /2 ) * Math.sin( Δφ /2 ) + Math.cos ( φ1 ) * Math.cos ( φ2 ) * Math.sin( Δλ/2 ) * Math.sin( Δλ/2 ) ; const c = 2 * Math.atan2( Math.sqrt(a ) , Math.sqrt ( 1-a ) ) ; const d = R * c ; // in metres
Note in these scripts , I generally use lat / lon for lati­tude / longi­tude in degrees , and φ /λ for lati­tude / longi­tude in radians – having found that mixing degrees & radians is often the easiest route to head - scratching bugs ...
Historical aside :
The height of tech­nology for navigator ’s calculations used to be log tables .
As there is no ( real ) log of a negative number , the ‘ versine ’ enabled them to keep trig func­tions in positive numbers .
Also , the sin² ( θ / 2 ) form of the haversine avoided addition ( which en­tailed an anti-log lookup , the addi­tion , and a log lookup ) .
Printed tables for the haver­sine / in­verse - haver­sine ( and its log­arithm , to aid multip­lica­tions ) saved navi­gators from squaring sines , com­puting square roots , etc – arduous and error - prone activ­ities .
The haversine formula1 ‘ remains particularly well - conditioned for numerical computa­tion even at small distances ’ – unlike calcula­tions based on the spherical law of cosines .
The ‘ ( re ) versed sine ’ is 1 −cosθ , and the ‘ half - versed - sine ’ is ( 1 −cosθ ) / 2 or sin² ( θ / 2 ) as used above .
Once widely used by navigators , it was described by Roger Sinnott in Sky & Telescope magazine in 1984 ( “ Virtues of the Haversine ” ) : Sinnott explained that the angular separa­tion between Mizar and Alcor in Ursa Major – 0°11′49.69 ″ – could be accurately calculated on a TRS - 80 using the haversine .
For the curious , c is the angular distance in radians , and a is the square of half the chord length between the points .
If atan2 is not available , c could be calculated from 2 ⋅ asin ( min( 1 , √a ) ) ( including protec­tion against rounding errors ) .
Using Chrome on a middling Core i5 PC , a distance calcula­tion takes around 2 – 5 micro­seconds ( hence around 200,000 – 500,000 per second ) .
Little to no benefit is obtained by factoring out common terms ; probably the JIT compiler optimises them out .
Spherical Law of Cosines
In fact , JavaScript ( and most modern computers & languages ) use ‘ IEEE 754 ’ 64 - bit floating - point numbers , which provide 15 significant figures of precision .
By my estimate , with this precision , the simple spherical law of cosines formula ( cos c = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos C ) gives well - condi­tioned results down to distances as small as a few metres on the earth ’s surface .
( Note that the geodetic form of the law of cosines is rearranged from the canonical one so that the latitude can be used directly , rather than the colatitude ) .
This makes the simpler law of cosines a reasonable 1 - line alternative to the haversine formula for many geodesy purposes ( if not for astronomy ) .
The choice may be driven by programming language , processor , coding context , available trig func­tions ( in different languages ) , etc – and , for very small distances an equirectangular approxima­tion may be more suitable .
Law of cosines : d = acos ( sin φ 1 ⋅ sin φ 2 + cos φ 1 ⋅ cos φ 2 ⋅ cos Δλ ) ⋅ R JavaScript : const φ 1 = lat1 * Math .
PI/180 , φ 2 = lat2 * Math .
PI /180 , Δλ = ( lon2 - lon1 ) * Math .
PI/180 , R = 6371e3 ; const d = Math.acos ( Math.sin( φ1 ) *Math.sin( φ2 ) + Math.cos( φ1) *Math.cos ( φ2 ) * Math.cos ( Δλ ) ) * R ; Excel : = ACOS ( SIN ( lat1 ) * SIN ( lat2 ) + COS ( lat1 ) * COS ( lat2 ) * COS ( lon2-lon1 ) ) * 6371000 ( or with lat / lon in degrees ) : = ACOS ( SIN ( lat1 * PI ( ) /180 ) * SIN ( lat2*PI ( ) /180 ) + COS ( lat1 * PI ( ) /180 ) * COS ( lat2*PI ( ) /180 ) *COS ( lon2*PI ( )/180-lon1 *PI ( ) /180 ) ) * 6371000
While simpler , the law of cosines is slightly slower than the haversine , in my tests .
Equirectangular approximation
If performance is an issue and accuracy less important , for small distances Pythagoras ’ theorem can be used on an equi­rectangular projec­tion : *
Formula x =
Δλ ⋅ cos φ m y = Δφ d = R ⋅ √ x² + y² JavaScript : const x = ( λ 2 - λ1 ) * Math.cos (( φ 1+ φ 2) /2 ) ; const y = ( φ 2 - φ1 ) ; const d = Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y ) * R ;
This uses just one trig and one sqrt function – as against half - a - dozen trig func­tions for cos law , and 7 trigs + 2 sqrts for haversine .
Accuracy is somewhat complex : along meridians there are no errors , otherwise they depend on distance , bearing , and latitude , but are small enough for many purposes * ( and often trivial compared with the spherical approxima­tion itself ) .
Alternatively , the polar coordinate flat - earth formula can be used : using the co-latitudes θ 1 = π/2−φ 1 and θ 2 = π/2−φ 2 , then d = R ⋅ √θ 1 ² + θ 2 ² − 2 ⋅ θ 1 ⋅ θ 2 ⋅ cos Δλ. I ’ve not compared accuracy .
Baghdad to Osaka –
not a constant bearing !
Bearing
In general , your current heading will vary as you follow a great circle path ( orthodrome ) ; the final heading will differ from the initial heading by varying degrees according to distance and latitude ( if you were to go from say 35 ° N ,45 °E ( ≈ Baghdad ) to 35 °N,135 °E ( ≈ Osaka ) , you would start on a heading of 60° and end up on a heading of 120° ! ) .
This formula is for the initial bearing ( sometimes referred to as forward azimuth ) which if followed in a straight line along a great - circle arc will take you from the start point to the end point :

* note that Excel reverses the arguments to ATAN2 – see notes below
Since atan2 returns values in the range -π ... +π ( that is , - 180° ... +180° ) , to normalise the result to a compass bearing ( in the range 0° ... 360° , with −ve values transformed into the range 180° ... 360° ) , convert to degrees and then use ( θ+360 ) % 360 , where % is ( floating point ) modulo .
For final bearing , simply take the initial bearing from the end point to the start point and reverse it ( using θ = ( θ+ 180 ) % 360 ) .
Midpoint
This is the half - way point along a great circle path between the two points .

The longitude can be normalised to − 180 … +180 using ( lon+540 ) %360-180
Just as the initial bearing may vary from the final bearing , the midpoint may not be located half - way between latitudes / longitudes ; the midpoint between 35 °N,45 °E and 35 °N,135 °E is around 45 °N,90°E .
Intermediate point
An intermediate point at any fraction along the great circle path between two points can also be calculated .

Intersection of two paths given start points and bearings
This is a rather more complex calculation than most others on this page , but I 've been asked for it a number of times .
This comes from Ed William ’s aviation formulary .
See below for the JavaScript .
Intersection of two great - circle paths Point 1 : , Brng 1 : Point 2 : , Brng 2 : Intersection point :
Formula : δ 12 = 2 ⋅asin( √ ( sin ² ( Δφ / 2 ) + cos φ 1 ⋅ cos φ 2 ⋅ sin ² ( Δλ / 2 ) ) ) angular dist .
p1–p2 θ a = acos( ( sin φ 2 − sin φ 1 ⋅ cos δ
12 ) / ( sin δ 12 ⋅ cos φ 1 ) )
θ b = acos ( ( sin φ 1 − sin φ 2 ⋅ cos δ
12 ) / ( sin δ 12 ⋅ cos φ 2 ) ) initial / final bearings
between points 1 & 2 if sin( λ 2 −λ 1 ) > 0
θ 12 = θ a
θ 21 = 2 π − θ b
else
θ 12 = 2 π − θ a
θ 21 = θ b α 1 = θ 13 − θ 12
α 2 = θ 21 − θ 23 angle p2–p1–p3
angle p1–p2–p3 α 3 = acos ( −cos α 1 ⋅ cos α 2 + sin α 1 ⋅ sin α 2 ⋅ cos δ 12 ) angle p1 –p2–p3 δ 13 = atan2 ( sin δ 12 ⋅ sin α 1 ⋅ sin α 2 , cos α 2 + cos α 1 ⋅ cos α 3 ) angular dist .

φ 3 , λ 3 : intersection point % = ( floating point ) modulo note – if sin α 1 = 0 and sin α 2 = 0 : infinite solutions
if sin α 1 ⋅ sin α 2 < 0 : ambiguous solution
this formulation is not always well - conditioned for meridional or equatorial lines
This is a lot simpler using vectors rather than spherical trigonometry : see latlong - vectors.html .
Cross - track distance
Here ’s a new one : I ’ve sometimes been asked about distance of a point from a great - circle path ( sometimes called cross track error ) .
Formula : d xt = asin ( sin(δ 13 ) ⋅ sin( θ 13 −θ 12 ) ) ⋅
R where δ 13 is ( angular ) distance from start point to third point
θ 13 is ( initial ) bearing from start point to third point
θ 12 is ( initial ) bearing from start point to end point
R is the earth ’s radius
JavaScript : const δ 13 = d13 / R ; const dXt = Math.asin( Math.sin( δ13 ) *Math.sin( θ13-θ12 ) ) * R ;
Here , the great - circle path is identified by a start point and an end point – depending on what initial data you ’re working from , you can use the formulas above to obtain the relevant distance and bearings .
The sign of d xt tells you which side of the path the third point is on .
The along - track distance , from the start point to the closest point on the path to the third point , is
Formula : d at = acos ( cos(δ 13 ) / cos (δ xt ) ) ⋅
R where δ 13 is ( angular ) distance from start point to third point
δ xt is ( angular ) cross - track distance
R is the earth ’s radius
JavaScript : const δ 13 = d13 / R ; const dAt = Math.acos( Math.cos ( δ13 )/Math.cos(dXt/R ) ) * R ;
Closest point to the poles
And : ‘ Clairaut ’s formula ’ will give you the maximum latitude of a great circle path , given a bearing θ and latitude φ on the great circle :
Formula : φ max = acos ( | sin θ ⋅ cos φ | ) JavaScript : const φ Max = Math.acos( Math.abs( Math.sin(θ) *Math.cos ( φ ) ) ) ;
Rhumb lines
A ‘ rhumb line ’ ( or loxodrome ) is a path of constant bearing , which crosses all meridians at the same angle .
Sailors used to ( and sometimes still ) navigate along rhumb lines since it is easier to follow a constant compass bearing than to be continually adjusting the bearing , as is needed to follow a great circle .
Rhumb lines are straight lines on a Mercator Projec­tion map ( also helpful for naviga­tion ) .
Rhumb lines are generally longer than great - circle ( orthodrome ) routes .
For instance , London to New York is 4 % longer along a rhumb line than along a great circle – important for avia­tion fuel , but not particularly to sailing vessels .
New York to Beijing – close to the most extreme example possible ( though not sailable ! ) – is 30 % longer along a rhumb line .
Rhumb - line distance between two points Point 1 : , Point 2 : , Distance : km Bearing : Midpoint : view map hide map
Destination point along rhumb line given distance and bearing from start point Start point : , Bearing : Distance : km Destination point : view map hide map
Key to calculations of rhumb lines is the inverse Gudermannian func­tion¹ , which gives the height on a Mercator projec­tion map of a given latitude : ln( tanφ + secφ ) or ln( tan ( π / 4+φ/2 ) ) .
This of course tends to infinity at the poles ( in keeping with the Mercator projec­tion ) .
For obsessives , there is even an ellipsoidal version , the ‘ isometric latitude ’ : ψ = ln ( tan ( π / 4+φ/2 ) / [ ( 1−e⋅sinφ ) / ( 1+e⋅sinφ ) ] e / 2 ) , or its better - conditioned equivalent ψ = atanh ( sinφ ) − e⋅atanh ( e⋅sinφ ) .
The formulas to derive Mercator projection easting and northing coordinates from spherical latitude and longitude are then ¹
E = R ⋅ λ N = R ⋅ ln( tan ( π / 4 + φ / 2 ) )
The following formulas are from Ed Williams ’ aviation formulary . ¹
Distance
Since a rhumb line is a straight line on a Mercator projec­tion , the distance between two points along a rhumb line is the length of that line ( by Pythagoras ) ; but the distor­tion of the projec­tion needs to be compensated for .
On a constant latitude course ( travelling east - west ) , this compensa­tion is simply cosφ ; in the general case , it is Δφ / Δψ where Δψ = ln ( tan ( π / 4 + φ 2 /2 ) / tan( π/4 + φ 1 /2 ) ) ( the ‘ projected ’ latitude difference )
Formula :
Δψ = ln ( tan ( π/ 4 + φ 2 /2 ) / tan( π/4 + φ 1 /2 ) ) ( ‘ projected ’ latitude difference ) q = Δφ / Δψ ( or cosφ for E - W line ) d = √ ( Δφ² + q²⋅Δλ² ) ⋅ R ( Pythagoras ) where φ is latitude , λ is longitude , Δλ is taking shortest route ( < 180° ) , R is the earth ’s radius , ln is natural log JavaScript : ( all angles

PI/4+φ2/2)/Math.tan( Math .PI/4+φ1/2 ) ) ; const q = Math.abs( Δψ ) > 10e - 12 ? Δφ / Δψ : Math.cos ( φ1 ) ; // E - W course becomes ill - conditioned with 0/0 // if dLon over 180° take shorter rhumb line across the anti-meridian : if ( Math.abs ( Δλ ) > Math .

Bearing
A rhumb line is a straight line on a Mercator projection , with an angle on the projec­tion equal to the compass bearing .
Formula :
Δψ = ln ( tan ( π/ 4 + φ 2 /2 ) / tan( π/4 + φ 1 /2 ) ) ( ‘ projected ’ latitude difference ) θ = atan2 ( Δλ , Δψ ) where φ is latitude , λ is longitude , Δλ is taking shortest route ( < 180° ) , R is the earth ’s radius , ln is natural log JavaScript : ( all angles

Destination
Given a start point and a distance d along constant bearing θ , this will calculate the destina­tion point .
If you maintain a constant bearing along a rhumb line , you will gradually spiral in towards one of the poles .
Formula : δ = d/R ( angular distance ) φ 2 = φ 1 + δ ⋅ cos θ
Δψ = ln ( tan ( π/4 + φ 2 /2 ) / tan( π/4 + φ 1 /2 ) ) ( ‘ projected ’ latitude difference ) q = Δφ / Δψ ( or cos φ for E - W line ) Δλ = δ ⋅ sin θ / q λ 2 = λ 1 +

Notes :
Accuracy : since the earth is not quite a sphere , there are small errors in using spherical geometry ; the earth is actually roughly ellipsoidal ( or more precisely , oblate spheroidal ) with a radius varying between about 6,378 km ( equatorial ) and 6,357 km ( polar ) , and local radius of curvature varying from 6,336 km ( equatorial meridian ) to 6,399 km ( polar ) .
6,371 km is the generally accepted value for the earth ’s mean radius .
This means that errors from assuming spherical geometry might be up to 0.55 % crossing the equator , though generally below 0.3 % , depending on latitude and direction of travel ( whuber explores this in excellent detail on stackexchange ) .
An accuracy of better than 3 m in 1 km is mostly good enough for me , but if you want greater accuracy , you could use the Vincenty formula for calculating geodesic distances on ellipsoids , which gives results accurate to within 1 mm .
( Out of sheer perversity – I ’ve never needed such accuracy – I looked up this formula and discovered the JavaScript implementation was simpler than I expected ) .

Trig functions take arguments in radians , so latitude , longitude , and bearings in degrees ( either decimal or degrees / minutes / seconds ) need to be converted to radians , rad = deg⋅π /180 .
When converting radians back to degrees ( deg = rad ⋅180 / π ) ,
West is negative if using signed decimal degrees .
For bearings , values in the range -π to +π [ - 180° to +180° ] need to be converted to 0 to +2 π [ 0°–360° ] ; this can be done by ( brng+360 ) %360 where % is the ( floating point ) modulo operator ( note that different languages implement the modulo operation in different ways ) .

All bearings are with respect to true north , 0°=N , 90°=E , etc ; if you are working from a compass , magnetic north varies from true north in a complex way around the earth , and the difference has to be compensated for by variances indicated on local maps .

The atan2 ( ) function widely used here takes two arguments , atan2 (y , x ) , and computes the arc tangent of the ratio y/ x .
It is more flexible than atan( y / x ) , since it handles x=0 , and it also returns values in all 4 quadrants -π to +π ( the atan function returns values in the range - π / 2 to +π/2 ) .

If you implement any formula involving atan2 in a spreadsheet ( Microsoft Excel , LibreOffice Calc , Google Sheets , Apple Numbers ) , you will need to reverse the arguments , as Excel etc have them the opposite way around from JavaScript – conventional order is atan2 (y , x ) , but Excel uses atan2 ( x , y ) .

Note I use Greek letters in variables representing maths symbols conventionally presented as Greek letters : I value the great benefit in legibility over the minor inconvenience in typing ( if you encounter any problems , ensure your < head > includes < meta charset = " utf - 8 " > ) , and use UTF - 8 encoding when saving files ) .
With its untyped C - style syntax , JavaScript reads remarkably close to pseudo - code : exposing the algorithms with a minimum of syntactic distractions .
These functions should be simple to translate into other languages if required , though can also be used as - is in browsers and Node.js .
For convenience & clarity , I have extended the base JavaScript Number object with toRadians ( ) and toDegrees ( ) methods : I do n’t see great likelihood of conflicts , as these are ubiquitous operations .
I also have a page illustrating the use of the spherical law of cosines for selecting points from a database within a specified bounding circle – the example is based on MySQL + PDO , but should be extensible to other DBMS platforms .
Several people have asked about example Excel spreadsheets , so I have implemented the distance & bearing and the destination point formulas as spreadsheets , in a form which breaks down the all stages involved to illustrate the operation .
February 2019 : I have refactored the library to use ES modules , as well as extending it in scope ; see the GitHub README and CHANGELOG for details .
Performance : as noted above , the haversine distance calculation takes around 2 – 5 micro­seconds ( hence around 200,000 – 500,000 per second ) .
I have yet to complete timing tests on other calculations .

Whites are on the verge of becoming a minority among newborn children in the U.S. , marking a demographic shift that is already reshaping the nation 's politics and economy .
The Census reported Thursday that nonwhite minorities accounted for 48.6 % of the children born in the U.S. between July 2008 and July 2009 , gaining ground from 46.8 % two years earlier .
The trajectory suggests that minority births will soon eclipse births of whites of European ancestry .
" The question is just when , " said Kenneth Johnson , senior demographer at the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire .
He guesses the demographic milestone will be crossed in the next few years , and could happen as early as 2011 .
America 's changing face has transformed race relations from the traditional divide of black and white to a more complex mix of race , language and religion .
There are new strains on schools and social services , while immigration has emerged as one of the nation 's most contentious issues — as evidenced by Arizona 's recent law that makes illegal immigration a state crime .
A number of forces are pushing the U.S. toward a " majority minority " future .
The median age of the white population is older than that of nonwhites , and thus a larger share of minority women are in prime child - bearing years .
In addition , white women are having fewer children than nonwhites , while the growth in mixed marriages has led to more multiracial births .

Ophiuchus is depicted as a man handling a serpent ; his body dividing the large snake into two parts , giving way to the symbol used today as an Asclepius - the medical staff .
Astrologers have not included Ophiuchus in the wheel of Astrological signs because the Sun spends only about nineteen days in this 13th sign of the Mazzaroth .
Not that there was n't a 13th sign in the Heavens , but as far as Astrologers were concerned , the Sun traveled from the constellation ' Scorpius ' and then proceeded directly into the sign of Sagittarius .
In reality , this was not the case .
The Sun , for 19 days of the year , travels through the star constellation ' Ophiuchus ' before entering Sagittarius from Scorpius - see chart below .
thus
The sign of Ophiuchus is patterned after the original ' Serpent Holder ' , Enki , a Sumerian god .
he signs of the Zodiac are for the most part , the highway , or path on which the Sun takes it 's yearly journey across the heavens - as it would appear to Earthlings .
These signs are actually star constellations occupying space in which the Sun appears to travels in an earth year .
The original twelve signs / constellations : Aries , Taurus , Gemini , Cancer , Leo , Virgo , Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius , Capricorn , Aquarius , and Pisces are quite familiar to everyone , however , the thirteenth sign and constellation , [ Ophiuchus ] , is in fact , not well known .
To acknowledge a 13th sign now would seem awkward for astrologers , who like the tidiness of 12 signs that rule over the 12 houses of the Zodiac .
The heavens are alive and they do change after a few thousand years and the astrologer who wants to maintain accuracy must change along with the signs in the heavens .
he constellation of Ophiuchus is the only sign of the Zodiac which is linked to a real man .
This man lived in ancient Egypt around the 27th century BCE , and his name was Imhotep [ again patterned after Enki ] .
Many of the same attributes of Imhotep can also be found in the Biblical Hebrew man Joseph , son of Jacob - [ see comparison chart for these two men in separate article ] .
Imhotep is credited with many accomplishments including the knowledge and use of medicine .
It is said of Imhotep that he brought the art of healing to mankind .
The symbol of a serpent [ or snake ] , which is still widely used today to represent the medical profession , was used to represent Imhotep .
Imhotep was also known as ' Aesclepius ' to the ancient Greeks , but by any name the attributes are still all the same .
The attributes listed below describe the Serpent Holder , Imhotep , i.e. the Hebrew Joseph , and Aesclepius .
The keyword descriptions seen below originated with Betty Rhodes and are the attributes for the 13th sign of the Zodiac - Ophiuchus :

Caduceus vs the Staff of Asclepius
The Caduceus [ left ] depicts two entwined snakes set upon a rod , and was the ancient symbol of Hermes , the Greek god of merchants .
Today it is a common and popular symbol of the medical and allied professions .
If you have ever sat in waiting room chairs of a doctor 's room reading a medical journal , then you have come across the Caduceus .
Asclepius ( an ancient greek physician who was deified as the god of medicine ) is traditionally depicted as a bearded man wearing a robe that leaves his chest uncovered and holding a staff with his sacred single serpent coiled around it symbolizing renewal of youth as the serpent casts off its skin .
The single serpent staff also appears on a Sumerian vase of c. 2000 B.C. representing the healing god Ningishita , the prototype of the Greek Asklepios .
The probable medical origin of the single serpent around a rod :
In ancient times infection by parasitic worms was common .
The filarial worm Dracunculus medinensis aka " the fiery serpent " , aka " the dragon of Medina " aka " the guinea worm " crawled around the victim 's body , just under the skin .
Physicians treated this infection by cutting a slit in the patient 's skin , just in front of the worm 's path .
As the worm crawled out the cut , the physician carefully wound the pest around a stick until the entire animal had been removed .
It is believed that because this type of infection was so common , physicians advertised their services by displaying a sign with the worm on a stick .

Today marked an evolution of sorts for Twitter .
It 's no longer just for following your favorite celebrity rants or for informing your followers you 're having a ham sandwich or just took a shower .
And self - promotion on Twitter seems so yesterday .
Consider Friday 's tweets from Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff .
Around midnight , he tweeted that he'd given " the go ahead " to execute condemned inmate Ronnie Gardner .
Moments after the tweet to the attorney general 's roughly 7,000 followers , Gardner was executed by firing squad .
" May God grant him the mercy he denied his victims , " Shurtleff tweeted .
He also tweeted that it was " A solemn day " and to " Mourn his victims " around the same time Gardner was being pelted by a five - man firing squad .
To be sure , Shurtleff also invoked Twitter for what Twitter and politicians do best : self - promote .
" We will be streaming live my press conference as soon as I 'm told Gardner is dead .
Watch it at www.attorneygeneral.Utah.gov/live.html, " he tweeted .
Firing Squad is trending right now on Twitter .

Every year the Oscars come and go .
Almost every year there is at least one or two controversial picks .
This list looks at ten of the worst travesties relating to the Academy Awards .
Undoubtedly , some will disagree with a number of the entries and will want to add their own – feel free to do so in the comments .
10 Nominations
The Travesty : The Long , Expensive Campaigns for Nominations
It has long since become atrociously farcical how much lobbying goes into each nomination .
The biggest campaigns always revolved around Best Picture , Director and the acting categories .
And in order to keep a name in the Academy ’s flowing cup freshly remember ’d ( Henry V , thank you ) , the respective producers lobby , lobby , lobby and shell out inordinate sums of money to get some attention .
But , what about the small - budget work ?
The Independent films are more and more frequently snubbed in various categories these days , because they do n’t have the funds to keep up with the blockbuster campaigns .
The Oscar season once lasted from about December to February , but now , a campaign better begin in summer if it hopes to hold its ground and sway opinion .
Welcome to politics .
Money wins .
9 Michael Moore
The Travesty : Michael Moore Wins Best Documentary ( 2003 )
Moore should have won Best Documentary for Sicko ( 2008 ) .
He probably did n’t win because of the moronic scene he made in 2003 when he won for Bowling for Columbine .
He told everyone he would slam President Bush , but no one believed him .
Right or wrong , the Oscars was not the place for it .
It was similar to the ( in ) famous Black Panther salute of the 1968 Olympic Games .
Moore was soundly booed out of the building , and Steve Martin saved the day with a great joke .
Regardless , Bowling for Columbine is not a documentary .
It tells one side of the story , the liberal side , and should never have even been nominated .
It was , and it won , because it was by far the most popular blockbuster of documentaries in recent history .
It held its own with The Lord of the Rings : The Towers at the box office .
Why ?
Because it ’s deliberately inflammatory .
The proper political argument has always been one that considers all sides ( the U. S. has two , Conservative and Liberal ) .
Moore ’s film only enunciates the liberal side .
It does not , therefore , properly document anything .
8 Forrest Gump
The Travesty : Forrest Gump Wins Best Picture ( 1995 )
Forrest Gump was the feel - good movie of 1994 .
It ’s got “ heartwarming ” moments by the bucketload .
And it must have caught the Academy in a heartwarming mood , because it distracted them from its lack of a plot .
It ’s a series of happy , sad , humorous and endearing vignettes about the life of a mentally handicapped man , who somehow manages to be present at every single pop-culture event of the latter half of the 20th Century .
That stretches the suspension of disbelief past the breaking point .
The Best Picture of 1994 should have been a close race between Pulp Fiction ( which does have a plot , albeit out of order ) and Quiz Show .
7 Ralph Fiennes
The Travesty : Ralph Fiennes Loses Best Supporting Actor ( 1994 )
Some of the Academy ’s voting panel have recently admitted that they should have voted for Fiennes ’s horrific , odious portrayal of Amon Goeth .
Once again ( see entry # 1 ) , the Academy made the mistake of rewarding someone for a long , distinguished body of work , instead of giving the award to the year ’s best performance .
Tommy Lee Jones , who won for The Fugitive , is certainly superb as Deputy U. S. Marshal Samuel Gerard , but Fiennes is superlative in a performance that goes against his own nature as a human being .
He succeeds in acting as if he does not understand why anyone would care about Jews .
He is walking death in this film .
6 Ten Commandments
The Travesty : The Ten Commandments Loses Best Picture ( 1957 )
One of the worst films ever to win Best Picture somehow managed to steal it from one of the best never to win it .
The Ten Commandments does what no one thought possible at the time ( even now , it ’s regarded with a sense of awe since DeMille had no computers ) .
It won the Oscar for special effects , but that ’s all , and it lost Best Picture to Around the World in 80 Days .
In terms of storyline , it ’s usually a good bet to wager on the Bible .
It has a lot of good stories , whether or not you believe them .
The story of the Exodus may be the most epic , and that ’s saying a lot coming from the Bible .
DeMille et al. pulled it off with awesome verve and pacing .
The film is not overlong at 3 hours 40 minutes , because it persistently holds the audience enraptured with its scale and photography .
People put their hands over their mouths in theaters across the country when the Red Sea parted .
Right up to the last moment , they thought they would have to be cheated out of seeing it .
5 Saving Private Ryan
The Travesty : Saving Private Ryan Loses Best Picture ( 1999 )
It lost to Shakespeare in Love , which is a great film in all respects .
The final production of Romeo and Juliet , in the Globe Theater , is the best inkling on film of what it might have been like to see a Shakespeare play in Shakespeare ’s day .
But face it , no film has revolutionized its genre as vehemently , as fearlessly , as Saving Private Ryan for the war film .
It was not until 1998 that a director managed to overpower the censors in order to show combat for what it is .
This is , in terms of realism , the first war film to tell the truth .
All the other great war films lied , inasmuch as they shielded the audience ’s eyes to the reality of a 7.92 mm bullet going through some poor , nameless private ’s abdomen from the side : guts everywhere and the poor guy ’s screaming for his mama .
This film takes the uninitiated audience closer to combat reality than any other , and in its wake , we now have a slew of honest war films like Black Hawk Down , Pearl Harbor , The Thin Red Line , The Hurt Locker , to name a few .
We even have a still - popular WWII first - person shooter video game genre because of this film .
Saving Private Ryan was the first to get it right , and it certainly set the bar high , with a perfect , simple storyline , set against an epic historical backdrop .
Even Rambo IV took a new lead from it , showing Rambo ’s carnage the way it always should have been .
It ’s not fair to say that times had changed by 1998 , and the MPAA had become more liberal .
They still considered rating it NC - 17 ( which used to be X ) .
This would have been the first time in history that a film were given such a rating for any reason other than sex .
Spielberg finally changed their minds by tracking them down to a conference room and explaining that the MPAA had been lying to the world for 100 years , and the time of Victorian sensibilities had long since passed .
Now was the time to tell the truth about Omaha Beach .
4 Peter O’Toole
The Travesty : The Many Nominations of Peter O’Toole
Talk about the luck of the Irish .
O’Toole is probably the finest actor alive today ( and this lister is a huge fan of Daniel Day - Lewis ) .
He holds the record for most acting nominations without a win , eight , all in the lead category .
Granted , that category is a horse race every year , and he went up against some of the truly indelible performances , from the 1960s to the present .
Gregory Peck deserved the win for To Kill a Mockingbird , but what about Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady ?
It ’s a musical and he can’t manage more than a 4 - note range in his singing voice .
As a result , he did sprechenstimme , as the Germans would call it , “ singing speech . ”
His acting is just fine , but there ’s something glaringly absent in the film without the main character singing his songs .
Then the Academy shamed itself in 1969 , when it gave the award to Cliff Robertson , an American , instead of O’Toole , from the U. K. O’Toole put forth the performance of a lifetime as King Henry II , the second time , after Becket , and the result was poetry in motion and speech .
It sounds like Shakespeare , but it comes out like common conversation .
It may be his best work .
But then there ’s Venus ( 2007 ) , in which he plays a fictitious old man who ’s obsessed with a 16 - year - old girl .
The award went to Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin , a real person .
When it comes to acting , the fictitious characters have always been much more difficult to portray than real people .
Whitaker had the real Amin ’s performances in newsreels to impersonate .
O’Toole had no one but himself .
The Academy should have done one of two things that year : either not nominated him at all , or given him the win .
This lister believes that of the 5 nominated performances , O’Toole ’s is truly the best .
It was consummate understatement throughout , instead of the flashy bravura Whitaker put forth .
Bravura routinely wins .
3 Stanley Kubrick
The Travesty : Stanley Kubrick Never Won Best Director
Like the next entry , Kubrick directed some of cinema ’s absolute masterpieces , films that have stood the test of time and remain utter genius in all regards .
He was nominated for 4 of them , and never won .
He won an Oscar for his help with the adapted screenplay of Full Metal Jacket , but as a director , four of his finest efforts were evidently misunderstood .
That is the certainly the case for 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
Some critics slammed it as incomprehensible .
Others heralded it as the awakening of modern cinema .
For whatever reason , it somehow managed to lose Best Director to Carol Reed , for the musical Oliver !
That film is a fine work of drama , and perhaps deserved the Best Picture award .
But as a director , Reed did nothing new .
It ’s still a musical , a good one , but nothing groundbreaking or innovative in any way ( except that Oliver Twist does not have such a happy ending ) .
Kubrick , however , landed all the technical aspects of a film with the same excellence in 2001 , and also opened a multitude of new doors into science fiction drama , and filmmaking in general .
Then there ’s Dr. Strangelove , easily one of the finest comedies in film history , because Kubrick had the nerve to poke fun at nuclear holocaust at the same time as the Cuban Missile Crisis .
And that does n’t mention just how sidesplittingly funny every single scene is .
His idea for the war room was a giant , green roundtable , so it would be like the generals and politicians were playing poker with the world ’s fate .
He came up with the line , “ Gentlemen , you ca n’t fight in here !
This is the war room ! ”
Then , consider that every performance is pitch - perfect , every scene is honed down to a razor ’s edge of timing and appearance .
He should have been nominated for his directing of Paths of Glory , and perhaps Spartacus .
2 Alfred Hitchcock
The Travesty : Alfred Hitchcock Never Won Best Director
Hitchcock is a byword , now , for suspense .
He was nominated as director 5 times , for Rebecca , Lifeboat , Spellbound , Rear Window and Psycho .
He lost all five , and was not even nominated for the now - renowned classics Vertigo , North by Northwest and The Birds .
The Academy finally honored him with the Irving Thalberg lifetime achievement award , for which he walked on stage , said , “ Thank you , ” and walked off .
As a result of this and other oversights , the lifetime achievement awards , like the Irving Thalberg and the Jean Hersholt , have become thought of as apologies to great actors , directors , etc , who deserved a competitive win or two and never got one .
Psycho , as one example , deserved the win for director over the other four nominees ( look them up ) , because after viewing all 5 performances , Hitchcock ’s is the only standout in terms of gutsiness and innovation .
The main character dies 30 minutes into the film !
And what a death scene !
In age of ridiculous gore , Psycho still scares and shocks .
1 John Wayne
The Travesty : John Wayne Wins Best Actor ( 1970 )
In the annals of acting awards , no honor has been so universally denounced , scorned , mocked or ridiculed as John Wayne ’s lead win for his performance as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit .
His portrayal has been called “ hammy , ” “ over the top ” and “ mischaracterized , ” among others , because he very obviously , even obscenely , comes out of character several times in the film , ceasing to be Rooster , and reverting to John Wayne .
He shotguns his dialogue for a change , instead of …pausing every few words in a real … laconic delivery of his words !
( his exclamation point ) .
But his shotgun delivery tramples all over many of the other actors ’ cue lines immediately before his .
He is trying his best to pull off a Spencer Tracy or a Laurence Olivier , and he fails miserably .
In his defense , however , he put forth some outstanding performances in his career , in Sands of Iwo Jima and The Shootist , to name two .
The Academy decided , and even admitted afterward , that it was time to honor his career with an Oscar .
Thus the award went to his body of work , not his performance , whereas the other five nominated performances were all much better for that year .
Any one of them is a valid choice , but this lister prefers Richard Burton ’s as Henry VIII in Anne of the Thousand Days , the most regal , fearless , authoritative performance in film to date .
As a result of the Academy ’s decision , Burton lost once again , and eventually died without one , though he might have deserved two ( The Spy Who Came in from the Cold ) .
The Academy has been accused of denying many deserved wins and nominations throughout the 1960s and 1970s from British actors , in order to honor more Americans .
A young girl has cried wolf for all the right reasons in this new Fable 3 combat showcase extended clip released by Lionhead Studios .
In the clip , the player confronts a massive pack of wolves on a snowy trail with a variety of combat moves that are familiar but improved upon .
Blood stains the snow and the fire spell seems much more effective , but nothing really stands out as revolutionary to the franchise .
Cut - scenes , featured in Fable but abandoned in the sequel , make a triumphant return as the player effectively slaughters the wolf pack and saves the little girl .
Lionhead promises the clip is not final gameplay footage and was created just to offer a taste of what ’s to come .
Fable 3 arrives in stores on October 26 for Xbox 360 and the PC .

CNN International has fired one of its senior editors after she published a Twitter message lamenting the death of a Lebanese Shi'ite cleric .
The above tweet by Octavia Nasr referred to the Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah , an early mentor of the militant group Hezbollah who died in Beirut on Sunday .
Nasr , a 20 - year CNN veteran based in Atlanta , departed from the channel after " a conversation " with Parisa Khosravi , a CNN senior vice president .
The channel was reported by the New York Times to have been alerted to the tweet by some supporters of Israel .
Fadlallah was also the spiritual leader of Hezbollah when it was formed after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 , though he later distanced himself from its ties with Iran .
A CNN spokesman said : " CNN regrets any offence her Twitter message caused .
It did not meet CNN 's editorial standards . "
Nasr is quoted in a BBC report as calling her tweet " an error of judgment " .
She said she had been referring to Fadlallah's " pioneering " views on women 's rights .
She said in a blog posting : " Reaction to my tweet was immediate , overwhelming and provides a good lesson on why 140 characters should not be used to comment on controversial or sensitive issues , especially those dealing with the Middle East . "

The U.S. Department of Transportation has analyzed dozens of data recorders from Toyota Motor Corp. vehicles involved in accidents blamed on sudden acceleration and found that the throttles were wide open and the brakes were n't engaged at the time of the crash , people familiar with the findings said .
The early results suggest that some drivers who said their Toyotas and Lexuses surged out of control were mistakenly flooring the accelerator when they intended to jam on the brakes .
But the findings — part of a broad , ongoing federal investigation into Toyota 's recalls — do n't exonerate the car maker from two known issues blamed for sudden acceleration in its vehicles : " sticky " accelerator pedals that do n't return to idle and floor mats that can trap accelerators to the floor .
The findings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration involve a sample of the reports in which a driver of a Toyota vehicle said the brakes were depressed but failed to stop the car from accelerating and ultimately crashing .
A NHTSA spokeswoman declined to comment on the findings , which have n't been released by the agency .
World ’s 1st Skyscraper with Built - In Wind Turbines ( The Razor )
July 13th , 2010 by Zachary Shahan
143 meters tall , rising above the crowd in Central London , Strata SE1 ( or “ the Razor ” as it is popularly called , due to its sharp , angular design ) , is the first skyscraper in the world “ to have electricity - generating wind turbines built into its core design ‘ fabric ’ . ”
Michael Ricciardi of Planetsave writes :
While there are other , much taller buildings with turbines added on following the finish of their primary construction , the Strata has included them in the architectural plan from the get - go .
The threesome of integrated wind turbines , at full capacity , will generate 8 % of the buildings energy needs .
This may not seem like very much , but it amounts to several dozen mega ( million ) watt hours annually –saving the owners and residents a great deal of money ( and freeing up extra capacity from traditional utilities ) .
The Razor is 42 stories high .
At such a height , it has nearly constant 40 mph winds coming at it .
That makes for a good place to have wind turbines .
It is also designed to make use of the change in airflow caused by nearby buildings , also known as the “ Venturi effect ” .
“ Named after Italian Physicist ( 1746-1822 ) Giovanni Battista Venturi , the ‘ Venturi effect ’ describes the inverse relationship between fluid ( or air ) flow speed and its pressure ( flow speed increases as pressure decreases ) as it is forced , or compressed , by a surrounding structure ( such as in a pipe , or between two buildings ) , ” Ricciardi writes .
Hopefully , we will see more such buildings incorporating self - sustaining power generation into the core of their design .
The Razor ’s 19 KW wind turbines use 5 blades instead of 3 to cut down on noise pollution .
The building is expected to generate 50 MWh of electricity a year .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Job recovery hits a wall
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The U.S. economy lost jobs in June , for the first time this year , as modest hiring by businesses only partly offset the end of Census jobs .
The Labor Department on Friday reported a net loss of 125,000 jobs in the month .
That was due primarily to the loss of 225,000 Census jobs that had swelled payrolls in May .
Business hiring rebounded to 83,000 , which was still a bit weaker than hoped .
While it 's up from the jobs private sector employers added in May , it was well below hiring levels in March and April .
" It 's job growth , but it 's a kind of growth that does n't please anybody , " said John Silvia , chief economist of Wells Fargo Securities .
" We 're not creating the jobs at a pace to help people who are looking for jobs .
Jobs are going to remain hard to find . "
Silvia and some other economists said the fact that businesses are still adding jobs should lessen fears that the economy is about to topple into another downturn , a so - called double - dip recession .
" Though disappointing , employment gains are substantially ahead of the 2002 recovery , " said Kurt Karl , chief U.S. economist at Swiss Re .
But others suggested that the weak labor market raises the risk the economy could fall back into recession later this year .
" It is a Catch - 22 situation , " said Sung Won Sohn , economics professor at Cal State University - Channel Islands .
" Businesses are reluctant to hire for fear of a double - dip recession .
But without jobs , the economy can't grow . "
Businesses have now added 593,000 jobs since the start of 2010 , after cutting 8.5 million in 2008 and 2009 combined .
President Obama pointed to the continued private sector job growth in his remarks Friday , but acknowledged more needs to be done .
" We are headed in the right direction , " he said when announcing a government program to bring broadband Internet services to rural areas .
" But ... we 're not headed there fast enough for a lot of Americans .
We 're not headed there fast enough for me , either . "
Republicans charged the report is proof the Obama administration 's policy of trying to stimulate the economy and hiring through government spending has been a failure .
" Every Washington power grab is creating more uncertainty for investors and job creators , and leaving more families without a paycheck , " said Sen .
John Cornyn , R - Texas .
The construction sector lost another 22,000 jobs as the pace of building fell sharply with the end of a tax credit for homebuyers .
And retailers , hit by softer consumer purchases , trimmed nearly 7,000 jobs .
But manufacturers added 9,000 jobs , and transportation companies and warehouses added nearly 15,000 jobs , showing some continued strength in the goods - producing sector .
Leisure and hospitality was the leading sector with a gain of 37,000 jobs .
There also was a gain of 20,500 temporary workers by business , which could be a sign of future hiring , since employers often bring on temporary workers before they commit to permanent jobs .
There are still 339,000 Census workers on the job heading into July , many of whose jobs will be ending .
That suggest that July could be another month with an overall loss in jobs .
State and local governments cut an additional 10,000 jobs in June .
That , was countered by the gain of 27,000 non-Census jobs by the federal government .
Unemployment rate drops
The unemployment rate fell to 9.5 % from 9.7 % in May .
Economists had forecast it would climb to 9.8 % .
But the improvement was due mostly to many discouraged job seekers not bothering to look for work and no longer being counted as part of the labor force .
Joseph LaVorgna , chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank , said that many of those people stopped looking for work because they lost extended unemployment benefits .
To receive the benefits , they needed to be actively looking for work .
" The decline in the unemployment rate is not a reflection of strength , but rather a sign of discouragement among the ranks of the unemployed , " he wrote in a note to clients Friday .
Congress has failed to pass an extension of benefits , which resulted in nearly half - million people losing their benefits by the middle of June when the unemployment numbers were compiled .
Another 1.25 million have lost their benefits since mid-June , and nearly 800,000 more could lose benefits by the time July numbers are compiled .
The 14.6 million people still counted as unemployed have been out of work an average of 35 weeks , a record duration in the 62 years the government has tracked that figure .
Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted he is uncertain over the future of Nemanja Vidic .
The central defender is currently resting after playing for Serbia at the World Cup and when asked about speculation that the 28 - year - old may leave Old Trafford , Ferguson said : " I ca n't clarify it at all . "
When pressed and asked whether the Serb would play for the Manchester team this season , Ferguson replied : " I believe so . "
Vidic has been linked with a move to Spain for some time now but has remained loyal to Ferguson and Manchester United so far .
He said last season that he had " every intention " to see out his contract at United , which runs to 2012 .
The defender and the team 's other World Cup participants are expected to join up with the rest of the squad for the friendly against an Airtricity League XI in Dublin on Wednesday 4 August .
United beat the Philadelphia Union 1 - 0 last night in a scrappy game against Major League Soccer 's newest team .
The winning goal came in the 76th minute after Danny Welbeck intercepted a sloppy pass in midfield and ran straight through the defence before passing to Gabriel Obertan to score .
Dimitar Berbatov nearly extended United 's lead , hitting the crossbar from close range in the 80th minute .

When I first began working in SEO , I decided to read everything .
On top of the normal working hours for an SEO , I added 20 to 25 extra hours to read and apply what i read .
Within 3 months of working in SEO , I had my own affiliate site up and collecting a lot of traffic .
After 6 months of constantly reading SEO , I started to feel there was a lot of noise out there .
After my first year , I realised there are lots of people writing great content on SEO , but who did n’t seem to back any of it up with real world examples .
Ever since then most of the extra hours I put in are balanced towards testing , rather than listening to what people think may be happening .
Social & SEO the Evolution
I have been reading a lot of great posts over the past month on the effects of social on SEO and how that impact will grow over the next couple of years .
One of the best posts on this ( if not the best ) was David Harrys titled “ The Evolution of Rankings Signals : Google is Getting Past the link ” .
This post is jam packed with information on how the fundamentals of search could change with Google focusing more and more on : Temporal Data / Behavioral Data and Social Data .
I discussed this post with David over on SEODojo and his explanation of Google using the social graph to tweak results was really thought provoking .
One of his best comments was , if results are personalised , you ca n’t spam them ( why would you spam your own results ) .
There are also some other good posts on this from Eric Enge on the death of link building and another over at searchenginewatch called “ Are we over Engineer the Link Graph “ .
Finally there is a post from SimplyZesty called “ How Has Social Media Affected Search “ .
The Issue
To stay ahead in search / social or online in general , you need to stay ahead of the curve .
You need to understand what ’s coming down the road and prepare for it , as best you can .
But you also need to stay clear of changing your strategy to try and keep up with the latest chatter online .
Most of the information contained in the posts above I agree with , but some I do n’t .
In the post over on searchengine watch , one of the most important parts of that study was in the comments , where Eric Ward replied :
“ You write “ each keyword space / market space ( and georegion ) is going to have its own definition of a ‘ natural ’ link graph . ”
While I am happy to see folks coming around to this conclusion , for 16 years I ’ve been yelling that every web site requires a different link seeking and publicity strategy .
What is effective for one site may not work for another .
Every site has a manifest linking destiny . ”
BINGO
This is important .
In Simply Zestys post they write :
a . “ What is clear is that this weighting towards social media references is sorting out the good from the bad ”
Is this clear ?
Have they tested it ?
They seem to have made the leap from Eric Enge discussing why social media could start adding weight to a sites ranking , to it already happening in a clear and measurable way .
No doubt Google ’s QDF algorithm may use twitter and other social metrics to help it bypass the natural order of things for trending topics .
But it definitely is not clear how Google will integrate social metrics into the main algorithm .
For the best explanation refer to David ’s post above on the social graph .
Secondly :
b. “ You can no longer just create a load of content and spam links to it . ”
Again , this point is n’t valid .
Its market dependent .
It ’s like saying Wayne Rooney can no longer score goals , because he was awful during the world cup .
There are a multitude of markets where you can indeed create loads of content and spam links to it .
Most people who work in SEO will concur with that .
My Two Cents
The last post I wrote about link development touched on this subject .
In terms of what I have EXPERIENCED .
The effects of personalised search has been huge .
I have seen keyword increases for head keywords in competitive markets , yet traffic dwindling .
In some cases this is due to a change in user search behavior , with both branded search and large aggregator sites taking a lot of the market share ( will be the next blog post ) .
In other cases it looks as if it ’s down to personlised search or Google ’s rotation of rankings .
I am firmly on side with David Harrys posting , in terms of behavior metrics set to play ( if not already ) a huge part in the future of rankings .
In terms of social , I am totally onside with Eric Enge , social will play a big role .
But what I ca n’t say is how that role will be integrated by Google into the main algorithm .
Dependent on the market , I do look at integrating some type of social content into the mix , but Michael Gray has shown , Google does n’t always follow their own advice .
In terms of some other markets I am in ( personal affiliate sites ) , Fashion , Online Business , Selling Software – it ’s business as usual – crappy links and ok content 😉
I ’m into liquids this week , what can I say ?
I ’m not a big alcohol drinker as you know , seeing as it makes me rather pink in the face .
However .
I can appreciate alcohol produced on a truly craft level .
For example , I ’m mildly obsessed with this certain secret whiskey that I ’m going to tell you about in my book soon .
Furthermore , I was out for a friend ’s birthday the other evening , and the menu touted “ homemade tonic water . ” I had to know more .
They mixed it into some clear alcoholic liquid and it boggled my mind .
The truth is , they could have mixed it into some lemonade and seltzer water and it still would have boggled my mind .
It was all about the non-alcoholic tonic baby .
I want to teach you how to make it .
Because we should all have tonic water in our repertoire .
Chicken wings and tonic water .
And a bed roll .
That ’s what we need in life .
These are some of the ingredients to gather .
Minus the orange .
I rejected the orange upon second thought .
There are some tricky ingredients here .
But that ’s what the WWW is for .
Here ’s one spot to buy the cinchona powder .
Or if you ’re like me and you happen to live in a hippie dippie neighborhood like … say …
Berkeley , there will be a mystical herb store right on the corner with a very stern woman behind the counter .
And she will serve forth cinchona bark .
And tell you that they do n’t offer it in powder form .
And stare at you blankly .
And sternly .
I ’m just saying that could happen .
Not that I would know .
It ’s just a coincidence that I have bark here … and if you have bark like me rather than bark powder , just grind it in a coffee grinder .
And if you do n’t have a coffee grinder , just use it as is and all will be well .
Promise .
This is the bark of a cinchona tree and when in powder it is called “ quinine powder . ”
That ’s the term you most often hear with tonic water — quinine .
Lemon grass is everywhere in Asian grocery stores and markets .
I ’ve even seen it in Whole Foods and a few other spots .
It ’s not something that you notice unless you ’re looking for it .
But it ’s there .
Or ask them to get some in for you .
Usually you can sweet talk the food buyer over the phone .
You want to bang on the lemon grass with the back of a knife first to help release the flavor .
Then you cut it into beautiful rings .
All of those ingredients simmer together in water and reduce by at least half , until thick and a bit syrupy .
Then you strain a first time to get the larger pieces out .
Then you strain a second time through cheesecloth .
Do n’t use a coffee filter the way I did unless you have a lot of …
… patience .
I do not .
I want to taste immediately .
I wait for no tonic water .
Plus I think some barky sediment gives it that rustic quality I ’m going for .
And that ’s when you mix your syrup with your seltzer water .
And then with your clear alcoholic liquid or your lemonade .
The color will be brown not clear like the tonic water you see in the store .
And it will have a nice barky flavor .
My suggested ratios are below …
Give it a try sometime !

Why ?
Because Turkey has criticized Israel , of course .

Harvard study says 70 percent of domestic violence is committed by women against men Photo of Boudica taken in London England by Joseph Earnest by Joseph Earnest November 15 , 2013 Newscast Media HOUSTON —
Three years ago I wrote an article based on a scientific study done by Harvard Medical School that revealed domestic violence was not as one - sided as the media often depicts it .
The article to this very day is the second most popular article I 've written and is widely cited online and offline .
I have since discovered that the original article that was published on the Harvard Medical School Web site has been scrubbed , and my guess is that certain activist groups perhaps pressured the professors to remove it .
Most of these institutions depend on endowments and grants to function , so it is understandable how that may have been the cause of its removal .
As you can see , if you click on this original hyperlink , the article is gone : Original link from Harvard Medical School was here >> ( pop - up )
However , fear not .
Even three years ago , my discernment and sound judgment enabled me to envisage something like that happening , so I took a screen - shot of the entire article , just in case it was taken down .
I am re-posting the article and will compress it into PDF format that way you are able to use it as a reference resource .
You will find the PDF at the very end of the article .
One thing about Newscast Media is that it does not receive any funds from sponsors and is self - funded , therefore we are not beholden to any entity , and have the liberty to publish content as we so wish .
That 's what true independent and objective journalism exemplifies .
Another interesting aspect of the article is the comments section .
There are over 250 comments on this particular article , that you might find either amusing , or instructive at the very end .
Below is the original article : =======================================================
Original article by Joseph Earnest July 15 , 2010 Newscast Media HOUSTON —
As the media flashes images and plays tapes of Mel Gibson screaming at his former lover , one has to wonder what the other side of the story is .
It is obvious that Mel Gibson was set up by his girlfriend , whom he claims tried to extort him .
While I do n't condone any kind of violence , I have to present to my reading audience some cold hard facts that the ' mainstream media ' has chosen to ignore in relation to domestic violence .
Forensic expert Arlo West said on Good Morning America , in regard to the tapes , " I believe these are professionally done .
I think she had help .
She clearly was speaking into what we call a large diaphragm microphone .
Her voice is very well engineered .
She sounds great .
To authenticate a recording it must be an original . "
The information presented to you comes from investigative research of data produced by reputable organizations like Harvard Medical School , The Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) and the American Psychiatric Association , just to mention a few .
The mainstream media seems to imply that men are the sole perpetrators of violence against women , but research proves otherwise .
A recent study by Harvard Medical School conducted a survey of 11,000 men and women and found that 50 % of the violence was reciprocal .
Both men and women also took responsibility for being equally violent in the heat of passion .
The Harvard study found that when violence was one - sided , meaning unprovoked , both men and the women themselves who took the study said 70 % of the time it was the women who committed violence against the men .
See screenshot of study here >> ( pop - up ) Another study by the American Psychiatric Association that backs the Harvard Medical School study was published by Joan Arehart - Treichel who says , " When it comes to non-reciprocal violence between intimate partners , women are more often the perpetrators .

It is quite rare that a series of Congressional votes is so convoluted and ill - defined that even those who regularly cover the procedures of the House of Representatives were loathe to cover the late night votes , and even those who hazarded an attempt at explaining what had happened were unable to provide anything but the most broad - brush information .
A series of roll call votes , and President Obama ’s “ emergency ” war funding moves back to the Senate to be reconciled with the House bill , but what does it all mean ?
How was the war funding passed , and did every Republican in the House really vote against the vote that made it happen ?
The vote that passed the war funding , in a way , was Roll Call Vote 428 , a procedural vote which passed 215 - 210 , with every Republican voting against it and a number of antiwar Democrats voting in favor of it .
At the time of this vote , 8:02 PM , it was simply about procedure .
Yet when Roll Call Vote 430 passed at 10:34 PM , the procedures under Roll Call 428 ensured that the funding was approved , and would go back to the Senate .
Roll Call 428 ’s procedures insisted that the war funding bill would be automatically approved if any one of several later votes on amendments were passed .
Antiwar Republicans notwithstanding , the bulk of Republicans voted against 428 because they wanted to send the Senate bill straight to the president unamended .
The administration had asked for the funding before the July 4 recess , an impossibility if the bill had to go back to the already recessed Senate .
Yet after Roll Call 428 retroactively was the war vote , a number of antiwar Dems who voted in favor of the resolution and a number of prowar Republicans who voted against it were also given cover to claim a “ nuanced ” position on the war , and to argue semi-credibly that they either support or oppose the war , depending on what a particular audience wants to hear .
Rep. David Obey
As for the amendments , there were four attempted amendments , one of them passed and three failed .
The first of these amendments was the one that passed , the aforementioned Roll Call Vote 430 from Rep. Obey ( D – WI ) .
The Obey Amendment added a litanny of new features to the bill , including $ 16 billion in new domestic spending ( largely on education ) , and included a handful of non-spending resolutions , including demanding foreign airlines follow an up - to - date TSA no - fly list , and adding another set of sanctions against Iran , this time aimed at preventing them from hiring any contractors that also work for the US .
The second , Roll Call Vote 431 , would have stripped all war funding from the bill .
This failed horribly , with only 25 -376 .
Oddly , however , some of those who voted in favor of 431 also voted in favor of 428 , meaning they could again claim that they voted to defund the war while voting yes on the measure that ultimately funded the war itself .
Roll Call Vote 432 , the Lee Amendment , would have approved only limited war funds , only those related to withdrawal related activities .
This too failed 100 - 321 .
The final vote , Roll Call Vote 433 , was on the McGovern - Obey - Jones Amendment .
This could have required two things : it would have required a publicly released National Intelligence Estimate on Afghanistan by January 31 , 2011 , and would have required President Obama to submit a plan by April 4 , 2011 on how he intends to withdraw troops in July 2011 .
This somewhat closer vote failed 162-260 .
The bottom line of all of these amendments was that the president will not get his war funding before the recess , that the bill goes back to the Senate with the Obey Amendment attached , and depending on how the Senate votes , it will either be forwarded to Obama with this amendment or returned to the House for further consideration .
President Obama has threatened to veto the bill if it contains any of the amendments , including the Obey Amendment .
It remains to be seen if he will do so , however , if this is the difference between getting his emergency war funding or having to wait .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
| || ( Dagbladet ) : Tirsdag skrev Dagbladet om private selskaper som tjener millioner av kroner på å drive norske asylmottak på oppdrag fra UDI .
Hero Norge , Link AS og Norsk Mottaksdrift gikk til sammen med 60 millioner kroner i overskudd i fjor .
Per -Willy Amundsen , innvandringspolitisk talsmann i Frp , sier til Dagbladet at mye av grunnen til at private bedrifter kan tjene millioner av kroner på asylmottakene er den store strømmen med asylsøkere som kom til landet i 2009 .
Da kom det rundt 17 000 asylsøkere til Norge , ifølge UDI .
Noe som var en økning på 19 prosent fra året før .
- Hele asylindustrien er texas og reneste klondyke .
De har fått muligheten til å tjene massse penger , på grunn av den ekstreme veksten .
Plutselig har UDI måtte tredoble kapasiteten sin , sier han til Dagbladet .
Tvangsmidler -
Det er mange asylbaroner som tjener gode penger på dagens løsslupne asylpolitikk .
Disse folkene er jo også den fremste ekspontenten for den liberale politikken som føres nå , nettopp fordi de tjener penger på det .
Asylindustrien har sterke økonomiske interesser som vil fortsette ved en liberal , naiv og snilisistisk politikk , mener Amundsen .
Han mener likevel de private aktørene har vært en nødvendighet .
- Alternativet er enda verre , nemlig å ikke ha noe mottak å sette dem i.
Staten og kommunen hadde aldri klart å gjøre det så raskt .
- Frp ønsker en ganske annen politikk .
Vil ønsker å dramatisk redusere asylsøkere og ha lukkede asylmottak .
Hvis det skulle bli virkelighet hadde det ikke gått an å ha private aktører fordi private selskaper ikke kan ta i bruk tvangsmidler .
Det måtte staten og politiet gjøre .
Trappe opp kontrollene Lise Christoffersen ( Ap ) i kommunal - og forvaltningskomiteen på Stortinget sier til Dagbladet at de ikke vil utelukke at man også skal sette ut asylmottak på anbud i framtiden .
- UDI må sørge for at kvaliteten som leveres er i tråd med tilbudet som er lagt inn , og hvis det er urimeligheter må man trappe opp kontrollene .
Dette så man blant annet eksempel på da det kom fram at ansatte på Lier ventemottak hadde jobbet ulovlig overtid , sier hun til Dagbladet .
Christoffersen mener likevel man bør være åpne for å diskutere hvorvidt offentlige tjenester skal legges ut på anbud .
- Vi må akseptere at de private selskapene tjener penger på dette , men det får være en grense .
Det skal ikke være sånn at man skal redusere på kvaliteten for å øke overskuddet .
Danny Green 's IBO cruiserweight world title bout against Paul Briggs ended in farce after Briggs was knocked out just 29 seconds into the first round by a punch that hardly touched him .
Briggs stumbled a few steps , dropped to the canvas and was counted out after copping a mere graze to the head from a weak Green left jab that would have hardly fazed a commoner in the street .
Green was left fuming at Tuesday 's weigh - in when Briggs tipped the scales at 87.2 kg , more than three kilograms above the agreed 84kg limit .
But the West Australian was even angrier after the inept showing from Briggs , who was returning to the ring for the first time since 2007 .
Briggs was booed as he left the arena as irate fans , who paid a minimum of $ 59 to attend the fight , showered the Queenslander with beer while chanting " bull - shit " .
" Guys , just chill out , no one 's as pissed off as me , believe me , " an irate Green said .
" There 's not one more person in this room is more jacked than me .
" I can't say sorry enough for that person .
He ain't even a canine .
Paul Briggs ai n't getting paid a cent .
" I do n't blame each and every one of you guys in here for being filthy .
" I want to go to the change room right now and give him the flogging he deserves .
" I 'm ... spewing and I can't say sorry enough for you guys .
I will make it up to you guys .
Thank you very much for coming out and supporting me .
" He ain't getting paid guys , I 'm very sorry .
I can't do anything more .
" I just ca n't say sorry enough .
I do n't know , I 'm just flipping out right here . "
The fight was switched from Sydney to Perth at late notice after the NSW Sports Combat Authority refused to sanction the bout due to health concerns surrounding Briggs .
Since ending his retirement last year , Green has defeated Anthony van Niekerk , Julio Cesar Dominguez , Roy Jones Jr , Manny Siaca and now Briggs , although the latest fight could be hardly considered a bout .
The win improves Green 's record to 30 wins ( 27 by knockout ) and three losses .
Police say one man has been charged with assault after a police officer who was escorting Briggs back to his dressing room was struck by an object .
On the undercard , New Zealand heavyweight boxer Shane Cameron defeated Australian Daniel Ammann by unanimous decision in their 10 - round bout .
Cameron , who is eager to take on Green , started strongly , landing some meaningful blows in the early rounds as Ammann relied on defence .
But the 93.7kg Cameron , who has dropped 13kg in recent months and will need to drop almost 10kg more to stand a chance of taking on Green in the future , wore some blows late in the contest and admitted he struggled to adapt to his new weight .
" I did n't find the spark tonight , " Cameron said .
" What we 're looking for is a fight with Danny Green , that 's what we want .
We 're a step closer to it . "
West Australian light welterweight Willie Kickett defeated Jack Asis by unanimous points decision in their six - round bout .

Colorado residents found it easy to part with their valuables at a buying roadshow Wednesday — everything except their gold .
The price of gold has risen almost 350 percent since 2000 , although critics have warned that the commodity might be due for a correction .
Many sellers at the week - long buying roadshow hosted by Global Estate Merchandisers Co. , known as GEMCo , said the current price was not high enough — not with print and television advertisements promising a future of skyrocketing prices .
Gold traded around $ 1,231 an ounce on the spot market Wednesday .
Denver resident Hugo Quintana , 51 , said now was as good a time as any to sell his collection of bracelets , rings , silver - plated flatware and small bronze sculptures .
He has been unemployed for more than a year and needs the money .
But Quintana did not bring any gold along with his trove .
“ It ’ll be the last thing I get rid of , ” he said .
“ Gold might go up , so I want to hold onto it as long as I can . ”
After earning almost $ 245 for the small amount of silver he brought , however , Quintana had second thoughts .
He might return to the show at the Embassy Suites in southeast Denver on Saturday with some gold - plated jewelry , he said .
“ If it were a different time — five , 10 years ago — I would not be satisfied ” with the selling price , he said .
Whether they come bearing coins , jewelry or unique watches , many sellers are more aware of gold prices than they used to be , said Justin Travers , a group leader and appraiser for GEMCo .
“ A couple of years ago when we started , I could n’t tell you the spot price of gold , ” Travers said .
“ Now , everybody knows it because it ’s in the paper every day . ”
Travers said his business does well in any economy because sellers part with valuables for personal as well as monetary reasons .
Many older sellers visit when they find their children have little interest in their silverware or coin collections .
Several sellers interviewed Wednesday shared the expectation that gold still has more bullish days ahead .
One Aurora man turned down a $ 1,100 offer for a 19th - century gold coin because he expects the price of gold to rise even higher .
He acknowledged that the seller ’s market wo n’t last forever but said he would keep waiting for now .
“ I wish I had gold and I ’d bought it at $ 300 , ” said Bob Green , 60 , a Littleton sporting - goods retailer .
He came to trade old coins and other items .
Travers said he expects more sellers to step forward when the metal ’s price slides .

PORT HARCOURT , Nigeria ( Reuters ) - Gunmen attacked two cargo vessels off the coast of the oil - producing Niger Delta , killing one crew member and kidnapping 12 foreign workers , Nigerian navy officials said on Saturday .
The crew members seized near Bonny in southern Rivers state on Friday have not been identified , but the military believe they are from eastern Europe .
A security official said the hostages were from Germany , Latvia , Lithuania , Russia and Ukraine .
“ Gunmen attacked the cargo vessel BBC Palonia and one other four nautical miles south of Bonny River , ” said navy spokesman Lt. Edward Yeibo .
“ The gunmen shot one dead and took others hostage . ”
Military officials were in contact with the kidnappers , demanding the immediate release of the hostages , said a navy commander in the capital Abuja .
Kidnappings for ransom are common in the Niger Delta , home to Africa ’s biggest oil and gas industries , with hundreds of incidents reported each year .
Most victims are released unharmed .
Foreign firms , ranging from oil to construction to telecoms , are forced to spend millions of dollars a year on security for their staff because of the high crime rate in the Niger Delta .
Security officials say former militants fed up with a government amnesty program could be behind a renewed wave of kidnappings , robberies and oil theft .
President Goodluck Jonathan has made a priority of reviving a post - amnesty program for thousands of former gunmen who surrendered their arms last year in return for the promise of stipends , education and job opportunities .
The first batch of 2,000 ex-rebels started a four - week rehabilitation class at the amnesty center in Obubra in Cross River state this week .
But the launch of the program was marred by violence on Thursday when a small group of former militants attacked a government convoy visiting the amnesty camp .
“ We expected these types of challenges , but the program will continue without delay , ” said Timi Alaibe , presidential adviser on Niger Delta affairs , who was at the amnesty center during the incident .
The IRS must take additional steps to ensure that accuracy - related penalties are appropriately considered when assessing correspondence audits .
...
A TIGTA review of 229 correspondence audits closed in Fiscal Year 2008 found that 211 ( 92 % ) of the audits were not considered and assessed in accordance with IRS procedures for accuracy - related penalties .
...
Appropriately assessing this penalty would have resulted in estimated increased revenues of $ 3.5 million .

This is the black couple who have amazed medical experts after their baby daughter was born with white skin , blue eyes and blonde hair .
Benjamin and Angela Ihegboro 's daughter , Nmachi , has flummoxed genetic experts who are unable to explain why she looks they way she does .
Doctors say the white - skinned newborn is not an albino .
The blonde , blue - eyed girl 's Nigerian parents say they do n't know of any white ancestry in either of their families .
The British couple are both of Igbo Nigerian origin and have dark skin .
Father Ben Ihegboro , 44 , a customer services adviser , admitted that when he saw the baby he exclaimed ' What the flip ? ' before joking : ' Is she mine ?
'Doctors at Queen Mary hospital in Sidcup insist that Nmachi - whose name means ' beauty of God ' in the couple 's native Igbo language - is not an albino .
Her stunned parents , who already have two black children , just ' sat and stared ' at their white baby when she arrived , they told the Sun last night .
' We both just sat there after the birth staring at her , ' said Mr Ihegboro .
Mum Angela said : ' She is beautiful , a miracle baby .
' Despite jokingly asking whether he was the father , Mr Igegboro said : ' Of course she is mine .
'My wife is true to me .
Even if she had n't been , the baby would n't have looked like that !' Pale skin genes can skip generations but neither Ben nor Angela Ihegboro - who only moved to Britain five years ago - know of any white heritage in either of their families .
' She does n't look like an albino child anyway , ' Mr Ihegboro said .
' Not like the ones I have seen back in Nigeria or in books .
She just looks like a healthy white baby .
' My mum is a black Nigerian although she has a bit fairer skin than mine .
But we do n't know of any white ancestry .
' We wondered if it was a genetic twist .
But even then , what is with the long curly blonde hair .
' The couple also have an older daughter , Dumebi , two , and a son , Chisom , four .
Mr Ihegboro said the couple 's son was even more confused than them .
He added : ' Our boy keeps coming to look at his sister and sits down looking puzzled .
'We are a black family .
Suddenly he has a white sister .
' But all that matters is that she is healthy and that we love her .
' Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together .
If a woman is of mixed race , her eggs will usually contain a mixture of genes coding for both black and white skin .
Similarly , a man of mixed race will have a variety of different genes in his sperm .
When these eggs and sperm come together , they will create a baby of mixed race .
But , very occasionally , the egg or sperm might contain genes coding for one skin colour .
If both the egg and sperm contain all white genes , the baby will be white .
And if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin , the baby will be black .
In 2006 a British mixed race couple gave birth to twin girls , one of whom was white and the other black .
Both Kylie and her partner Remi Horder , 17 , are of mixed race .
Their mothers are both white and their fathers are black .
But the chances of the twin girls having completely different skin colours was one in a million .
According to the Multiple Births Foundation , baby Kian must have inherited the black genes from both sides of the family , whilst Remee inherited the white ones .
I saw a table at the market the other night groaning under the weight of a mountain of summer squash .
Squash that looked like it wanted to avalanche its way into my basket .
I took pity , grabbed a bunch , and made my way home .
I ended up using a couple in a favorite nothing - to - it sautéed zucchini recipe .
It 's pictured here served over a simple plate of spaghetti .
The sautéed zucchini ?
It 's a single - skillet kind of thing .
Coins of zucchini are browned in a pan , but what makes it special is the toasted golden slivers of garlic combined with lots of fresh dill .
Throw in a sprinkling of almonds for crunch , and you 're all good .
Prep takes five minutes , if that , and you can treat this as a side dish , or use it as a component of something else ...
Variations
I often cook up a pan of the zucchini like this , and then use it to top off a frittata .
Or toss it with a platter of pasta .
Over farro with some harissa - spiked vinaigrette ?
Not bad .
Baked as a hand - pie in a simple pastry with a smudge of goat cheese ?
Even better .
Anyhow , it 's really adaptable .
And for those of you who do n't use much dill in your cooking ... let me just say , dill is under - rated and under-utilized .
The more I cook with it , the more I love it - fingers crossed you like this spin as much as I do .
Different Types of Zucchini
You can sauté just about any kind of zucchini !
Or a blend of zucchini / summer squash , as pictured here .
A pro tip - attempt to slice it all the same 1/4 - inch thickness .
As far as shape goes - you can slice full coins , or half coins .
You can slice zucchini straight across , or angle it , and slice on a bias .
Feel free to experiment !
Four months into their tour in southern Afghanistan , a Special Forces A - team still has no idea who they 're fighting .
“ I do n’t know where to pinpoint them [ or ] how to pinpoint them , ” the team ’s intelligence sergeant tells Army Times ace Sean Naylor .
“ They ’re not wearing awesome T - shirts that say , ‘ I ’m Taliban . ’ ”
“ I ca n’t find them , ” he continues .
“ This is our biggest failure . ”
As Naylor points out in his story ( not yet online , alas ) , the team has been able to help stitch together a stronger local government .
Some counterinsurgents might say that 's way more important than focusing on the enemy .
Major General Mike Flynn , the top U.S. intelligence officer in Afghanistan , blasted his colleagues and subordinates earlier this year for focusing too much on whacking Taliban , and not enough on learning the cultural , social , and economic lay of the land .
But ignorance about the other side – I 'm pretty sure Flynn did n't have that in mind , either .

Joe Barton's BP ' shakedown ' comments are nothing new
By Matt DeLong
At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing Thursday , Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Tex . ) apologized to BP CEO Tony Hayward for the $ 20 billion " shakedown " the oil company received from President Obama .
Your Browser DoesNot Support IFrames .
" I 'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday , " Barton said .
" I apologize .
I do not want to live in a country where any time a citizen or corporation does anything wrong , " they are subjected to such political pressure .
" What is shameful is that Joe Barton seems to have more concern for big corporations that caused this disaster than the fishermen , small business owners and communities whose lives have been devastated by the destruction .
Congressman Barton may think that a fund to compensate these Americans is a ' tragedy ' , but most Americans know that the real tragedy is what the men and women of the Gulf Coast are going through right now .
Members from both parties should repudiate his comments . "
The White House immediately shot back with a statement from press secretary Robert Gibbs calling for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to condemn Barton 's comments .
Barton 's apology may have come as a surprise to anyone unfamiliar with his positions on energy and climate change .
But Barton has a long history of making colorful ( not to mention energy industry - friendly ) comments on these issues .
Here 's a sample .
Wind energy could alter wind patterns and aggravate global warming .
" Wind is God 's way of balancing heat .
Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it 's hotter to areas where it 's cooler .
That 's what wind is .
Would n't it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy , which is a finite resource , which slows the winds down , which causes the temperature to go up ?
Now , I 'm not saying that 's going to happen , Mr. Chairman , but that is definitely something on the massive scale .
I mean , it does make some sense .
You stop something , you can't transfer that heat , and the heat goes up .
It 's just something to think about . "
" I think that it 's inevitable that humanity will adapt to global warming .
I also believe the longer we postpone finding ways to do it successfully , the more expensive and unpalatable the adjustment will become .
Adaptation to shifts in temperature is not that difficult .
What will be difficult is the adaptation to rampant unemployment -- enormous , spontaneous and avoidable changes to our economy -- if we adopt such a reckless policy as cap - and - tax or cap - and - trade . "
" CO2 is odorless , colorless , tasteless - it 's not a threat to human health in terms of being exposed to it .
We create it as we talk back and forth .
So , and if you go beyond that , on a net basis , there 's ample evidence that warming generically -- however it is caused -- is a net benefit to mankind . "
Sometimes , however , Barton prefers to let his actions do the talking .
During a hearing on the Waxman - Markey climate bill last year , Barton read the paper while his former upper - chamber colleague , John Warner ( R - Va. ) , testified .
South Korea has referred North Korea to the United Nations Security Council over the sinking of a South Korean warship that Seoul says was attacked by a North Korean submarine .
The action was announced Friday by South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , during a visit to Singapore .
North Korea has strongly denied any involvement in the March attack , which killed 46 South Korean sailors .
Just hours before Lee spoke , Pyongyang threatened what it called the " toughest retaliation " if Seoul takes the matter to the UN Security Council .
Lee did not say if South Korea would push for sanctions against the North , but called the sinking of the Cheonan " reprehensible " and said Pyongyang must admit its wrongdoing .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in Singapore Friday that joint naval exercises with South Korea may be postponed to allow time for Seoul to secure more diplomatic support at the UN .
Those exercises had been scheduled for next week .
The U.S. naval commander in the Pacific said earlier Friday that he sees no signs North Korea is planning any provocations or attacks on the South .
Speaking on the sidelines of the security conference in Singapore , Admiral Robert Willard said he had instructed his forces to be especially vigilant but that he had not seen North Korea massing troops along the border or preparing another nuclear test .
The two Koreas signed an armistice in 1953 , but technically remain in a state of war .

Here 's the first ( and probably the biggest ) jaw - dropping moment of today 's hearing with BP CEO Tony Hayward : GOP Rep .
Joe Barton , the top Republican on the House Energy Committee ’s subcomittee for investigations , apologizing to BP CEO Tony Hayward , saying he ’s " ashamed " of the American response to BP ’s oil spill .
According to Barton , asking BP to set up an escrow account to compensate victims of BP 's disaster was a criminal action -- a " shakedown " as he put it .
Barton 's not alone : his comments echo those made by other Republicans in recent days , including Michele Bachmann , Haley Barbour , and Tom Price .
We 'll be liveblogging updates as the hearing continues throughout the day .
Update 1 -- GOP Rep. Marcia Blackburn continues the " give BP a break " theme from the Republican Party , saying " the current administration deserves a significant portion of the blame for the oil spill . "
I guess BP would have loved an apology from her , but at least she told them that it really was n't all their fault .
Update 2 -- GOP Rep .
Phil Gingrey continues the " attack Obama , not BP " message from Republicans , saying he 's looking forward to testimony from the administration .
You could feel the GOP love from Hayward , pleased that yet another Republican was taking heat off his company .
Update 3 --
Over the course of his career , roughly 1 in 4 dollars raised by Joe Barton has come from the energy industry , a total of $ 3.3 million .
Update 4 -- CNN and MSNBC both replayed Barton 's apology to BP at the top of the hour .
Fox completely ignored it .
Go figure .
CNN also played Markey 's response .
As Electronic Arts and THQ make the move to get a piece of the secondhand sale market with the strategic use of one - time use downloadable content codes , a Sony Computer Entertainment America exec expressed his own reservations with the used game market .
" I have very mixed emotions about [ one - time use codes in new games ] , " said SCEA SVP of publisher relations Rob Dyer in a new Gamasutra feature interview .
Sony has yet to use these codes -- meant to coax players into buying games new -- in its own new game packaging .
" I am a big believer in encouraging the gamer to have a reason to hold onto [ a game ] and to continue to play , and for the publisher to be able to see something if there is a second sale , " Dyer said , " because right now , for years , as a publisher , we saw nothing [ from used sales ] .
Very frustrating .
" Third - party publisher EA is spearheading a new trend in the game industry that has publishers including a one - time use code packaged in with new games .
The original buyer of the new game submits this code to an online storefront like PlayStation Network or Xbox Live in exchange for downloadable content or features .
Used game buyers ( assuming the original owner already used the code ) will have to pay extra to gain access to this content .
In the case of EA 's Online Pass , used game buyers will have to pay extra for content and online multiplayer access .
THQ has adopted this method for online play with its newfighting game , and Ubisoft said it was watching EA 's tactic " very carefully .
"
It 's part of publishers ' efforts to grab a piece of the substantial used game market -- a market in which game publishers do not see direct revenues , only retailers like GameStop .
" As a first party , I understand why there 's a second sale , but I 'm not always excited about it .
Look , this has been a tough couple of years , " said Dyer .
" People have not been making money , and I think the used games business has been having a huge impact in that . "
" I 'm happy to debate merits , pros , and cons with folks at GameStop and have that discussion because again , I 've sat on the other side and I 've seen what can happen .
People need to see a way to monetize that second sale , " he said .

Wicked Good Chocolate Peanut Butter Pudding Cups .
They ’re from the book , Sticky , Chewy , Messy , Gooey Treats for Kids by Jill O’Connor and just as good as their name states .
Jill sent me and my niece a copy of her book as a little thank you for a post I did inspired by her Cheesecake Pops .
We had a hard time deciding which recipe to try first , but we kept coming back to these pudding cups .
They were really fun to make and even more fun to eat .
You ’ll see what I mean in a minute .
And the best part …
I did n’t have to do any of the work .
My little helper did it all .
From separating the egg yolks , to the measuring and mixing .
She cooked the pudding .
And mixed in the peanut butter … ( thank you , Jill ) … and the extra chocolate chips …
Oh my !
Let the pudding chill for at least four hours before eating .
Here ’s a link to the Pudding Recipe so you can print it out .
Now , here ’s the best part .
It involves balloons to make bowls .
Okay , I did help a little bit here .
We blew up regular size balloons about halfway so they were still small , but found that water balloons worked best .
They are a perfect size for this project , just hard to fill with air instead of water .
I about busted a lung .
After you blow up the balloons , wash them off and let them dry .
And before you use each one , spray a little non -stick cooking spray on each .
Just a little .
Okay , here ’s what you do .
Melt some semi-sweet chocolate , white chocolate or confectionery coating .
I used the same candy coating I use for cake pops .
Let it cool slightly before using .
It does n’t need to be super hot .
Spoon a small amount on a wax - paper - covered baking sheet .
Then take one of your prepared balloons and dip it in the chocolate .
Dip it in enough so the chocolate makes a bowl shape around the balloon .
Remove from the chocolate and place the balloon gently on top of the chocolate waiting on the baking sheet .
And repeat .
Repeat .
Repeat .
Repeat .
It ’s as easy as one …
two …
three !
And like I said earlier … just fun .
She was so proud .
And so was I .
You can place the tray of balloon bowls in the refrigerator to speed up the drying time .
Then it ’s time for the really fun part .
Pop them all with a pin .
Gently remove the balloon carnage from the inside of the cups and they are ready to go .
If you want , you can also serve other treats in them like ice cream .
But we had wicked good pudding waiting in the fridge .
Fill each cup as full as you want .
Then you can top them off with whipped cream .
Lots and lots of whipped cream .
To make Jill ’s Sweetened Whipped Cream , just chill a metal bowl and beaters in the freezer for about 15 minutes ( to help whip the cream faster ) .
Then combine 2 cups heavy cream , 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla .
Beat on medium - low using a mixer until the cream starts to thicken .
Then increase speed to medium - high and beat until firm peaks form .
And yep , my niece made that too .
Tired arms and all .
Finally , you can add some sprinkles .
As few …
or as many as you like .
Want some ?
Come on … you know you do .
And when you ’re all finished , you can eat the bowl , too .
Enjoy making a mess !
And , check out Jill ’s book .
I think you ’ll be glad you did .
Sticky , Chewy , Messy , Gooey Treats for Kids
and the original …
Sticky , Chewy , Messy , Gooey
Here ’s a link to the Pudding Recipe so you can print it out .
Hydro-power :
Is it green if it devastates indigenous peoples ?
Environmentalists and indigenous groups have come together to condemn a 15 million US dollar plan for six hydroelectric dams in the Peruvian Amazon , signed last week by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Peruvian President , Alan Garcia .
While the six dams would produce over 6,000 megawatts , mostly for Brazil , critics say the dams will flood tens of thousands of hectares of rainforest , devastate the lifestyles of a number of indigenous groups , and only serve big Brazilian corporations .

What goes on inside your brain when you exercise ?
That question has preoccupied a growing number of scientists in recent years , as well as many of us who exercise .
In the late 1990s , Dr. Fred Gage and his colleagues at the Laboratory of Genetics at the Salk Institute in San Diego elegantly proved that human and animal brains produce new brain cells ( a process called neurogenesis ) and that exercise increases neurogenesis .
The brains of mice and rats that were allowed to run on wheels pulsed with vigorous , newly born neurons , and those animals then breezed through mazes and other tests of rodent I.Q. , showing that neurogenesis improves thinking .
But how , exactly , exercise affects the staggeringly intricate workings of the brain at a cellular level has remained largely mysterious .
A number of new studies , though , including work published this month by Mr. Gage and his colleagues , have begun to tease out the specific mechanisms and , in the process , raised new questions about just how exercise remolds the brain .
Some of the most reverberant recent studies were performed at Northwestern University ’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago .
There , scientists have been manipulating the levels of bone - morphogenetic protein or BMP in the brains of laboratory mice .
BMP , which is found in tissues throughout the body , affects cellular development in various ways , some of them deleterious .
In the brain , BMP has been found to contribute to the control of stem cell divisions .
Your brain , you will be pleased to learn , is packed with adult stem cells , which , given the right impetus , divide and differentiate into either additional stem cells or baby neurons .
As we age , these stem cells tend to become less responsive .
They do n’t divide as readily and can slump into a kind of cellular sleep .
It ’s BMP that acts as the soporific , says Dr. Jack Kessler , the chairman of neurology at Northwestern and senior author of many of the recent studies .
The more active BMP and its various signals are in your brain , the more inactive your stem cells become and the less neurogenesis you undergo .
Your brain grows slower , less nimble , older .
But exercise countermands some of the numbing effects of BMP , Dr. Kessler says .
In work at his lab , mice given access to running wheels had about 50 percent less BMP - related brain activity within a week .
They also showed a notable increase in Noggin , a beautifully named brain protein that acts as a BMP antagonist .
The more Noggin in your brain , the less BMP activity exists and the more stem cell divisions and neurogenesis you experience .
Mice at Northwestern whose brains were infused directly with large doses of Noggin became , Dr. Kessler says , “ little mouse geniuses , if there is such a thing . ”
They aced the mazes and other tests .
Whether exercise directly reduces BMP activity or increases production of Noggin is n’t yet known and may not matter .
The results speak for themselves .
“ If ever exercise enthusiasts wanted a rationale for what they ’re doing , this should be it , ” Dr. Kessler says .
Exercise , he says , through a complex interplay with Noggin and BMP , helps to ensure that neuronal stem cells stay lively and new brain cells are born .
But there are caveats and questions remaining , as the newest experiment from Dr. Gage ’s lab makes clear .
In that study , published in the most recent issue of Cell Stem Cell , BMP signaling was found to be playing a surprising , protective role for the brain ’s stem cells .
For the experiment , stem cells from mouse brains were transferred to petri dishes and infused with large doses of Noggin , hindering BMP activity .
Without BMP signals to inhibit them , the stem cells began dividing rapidly , producing hordes of new neurons .
But over time , they seemed unable to stop , dividing and dividing again until they effectively wore themselves out .
The same reaction occurred within the brains of living ( unexercised ) mice given large doses of Noggin .
Neurogenesis ramped way up , then , after several weeks , sputtered and slowed .
The “ pool of active stem cells was depleted , ” a news release accompanying the study reported .
An overabundance of Noggin seemed to cause stem cells to wear themselves out , threatening their ability to make additional neurons in the future .
This finding raises the obvious and disturbing question : can you overdose on Noggin by , for instance , running for hours , amping up your production of the protein throughout ?
The answer , Dr. Gage says , is , almost certainly , no .
“ Many people have been looking into ” that issue , he says .
But so far , “ there has not been any instance of a negative effect from voluntary running ” on the brain health of mice .
Instead , he says , it seems that the effects of exercise are constrained and soon plateau , causing enough change in the activity of Noggin and BMP to shake slumbering adult stem cells awake , but not enough to goose them into exhausting themselves .
Still , if there ’s not yet any discernible ceiling on brain - healthy exercise , there is a floor .
You have to do something .
Walk , jog , swim , pedal — the exact amount or intensity of the exercise required has not been determined , although it appears that the minimum is blessedly low .
In mice , Mr. Gage says , “ even a fairly short period ” of exercise “ and a short distance seems to produce results . ”
Israel wo n't apologize to Turkey over the Gaza aid flotilla clashes and the possibility of giving compensation to those injured in the incident is not up for discussion , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday .
" Israel cannot apologize for our soldiers being forced to defend themselves against the mob that almost slaughtered them , " Netanyahu said during an interview with Israel 's Channel 1 .
" We are sorry over the loss of life , " Netanyahu said .
" This is clear . "
The prime minister also denied reports that Israel is considering compensating those injured in the clashes .
" That is not up for discussion , " Netanyahu said .
The clandestine talks between Industry , Trade and Labor Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu which took place in Brussels earlier this week caused a small spat between Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman .
Netanyahu acknowledged that it was a mistake not to update the foreign minister on what was happening .
" I explained the circumstances [ to Lieberman ] , the mistake was fixed and we are moving forward .
The coalition is not in danger , " Netanyahu said .
Speaking about the actual meet , Netanyahu said " It 's good that there was contact on a senior level , even if there are no agreements .
It 's good for Israeli interests and even for Turkish interests to try and stop the deterioration [ in relations ] . "
Netanyahu said that different people had approached him in recent weeks with proposals of finding ways to contact Turkey in order to stop the worsening of relations .
" One of them was Ben-Eliezer , who proposed an unofficial meet at the airport in Zurich .
I told him ' go ahead , meet . ' "

Coulomb Technologies to Create Electric Vehicle Infrastructure in Nine Regions by Offering No Cost Home and Public Charging Stations as Part of a $ 37 Million Project
Coulomb's ChargePoint America Program Expands the Largest Networked Infrastructure for EVs in the World : Immediate Installation in Nine US Regions
Campbell , Calif. , June 2 , 2010 – Coulomb Technologies today announced it will deliver free home and public ChargePoint® Networked Charging Stations for electric vehicles throughout the United States .
The ChargePoint America program will provide nearly 5000 charging stations to program participants in nine regions in the United States : Austin , Texas , Detroit , Los Angeles , New York , Orlando , Fla. , Sacramento , Calif. , the San Jose / San Francisco Bay Area , Redmond , Wash . , and Washington DC and is a strategic partnership with three leading automobile brands including , Ford , Chevrolet and smart USA .
Coulomb currently has the largest established base of networked charging stations worldwide with more than 700 units shipped to more than 130 customers in 2009 .
Installation of the ChargePoint charging stations for electric vehicles will begin immediately .
The $ 37 million ChargePoint America program is made possible by a $ 15 M grant funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act through the Transportation Electrification Initiative administered by the Department of Energy .
ChargePoint charging stations are available now for installation in all nine designated regional metropolitan areas of the US .
More than 1000 new public charging stations will be installed by December 2010 , adding to the existing ChargePoint Network .
The remaining stations will be installed by September 2011 .
In support of the ChargePoint America program , three automakers have committed to deliver electric vehicles in designated US regions .
The Chevrolet Volt , the Ford Transit Connect Electric and Ford Focus Electric through the " Ford Blue Oval ChargePoint Program " , and the smart fortwo electric drive will be introduced along with this program .
" The Obama Administration has set significant and considerable goals for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in the coming years , " said Richard Lowenthal , CEO of Coulomb Technologies .
" This grant will bring thousands of networked charging stations to nine US regions that are slated to receive the first electric vehicles from our automobile partners .
These charging stations will build upon our already growing and established network of infrastructure and will accelerate the deployment of public and private charging infrastructure which will in turn encourage consumers to buy electric vehicles .
Our Department of Energy grant , also known as the stimulus bill , was funded to provide jobs for Americans .
Our products are built and installed with American labor .
Every time we ship a ChargePoint charging station , three Americans go to work for a day . "
ChargePoint America will offer both home and public charging stations to individuals and businesses .
Businesses interested in receiving public charging stations should visit the ChargePoint America web site and sign up by completing the application form .
Individuals interested in purchasing an EV can sign up at www.chargepointamerica.com to receive more information about qualifying to receive a home charging station .
Additionally , the ChargePoint America web site provides a way to suggest public locations for charging stations .
ChargePoint Network stations are network - enabled , capable of reporting energy usage and communicating over the network with Software Application Services and Network Support Services to activate capabilities such as :
Providing open access for all drivers using any standards - based RFID card
Generating revenue for station owners to offset electricity and maintenance costs
Sending SMS or Email notifications to drivers for charging complete or interruptions in charging
Controlling access to eliminate energy theft and to enhance safety
Integrating with the utility Smart Grid for demand side management and preferred pricing
Charging stations owners can set their own prices for charging through the Flex Billing™ system .
The Flex Billing system enables station owners to set pricing as a function of time of day , calendar date , and driver - much like a parking meter .
Those same stations can also be configured to provide " free " access to EV drivers .
Coulomb's ChargePoint® Network , is open to all drivers of plug - in vehicles and provides authentication , management , and real - time control for the networked electric vehicle charging stations .
The network of electric vehicle charging stations is accessible to all plug - in drivers by making a toll free call to the 24/7 number on each charging station , or signing up for a ChargePoint Network monthly access plan and obtaining a ChargePass™ smart card .
Other future payment options include using any smart ( RFID ) credit / debit card to authorize a session or using a standard credit or debit card at a remote payment station ( RPS ) to pay for charging sessions .
To locate available charging stations , visit mychargepoint.net and click " Find Stations " .
About ChargePoint America
ChargePoint America will provide 4,600 public and private ChargePoint Networked Charging Stations by October 2011 .
Coulomb will work together with its distribution and industry partners to evaluate the demand from the respective geographic regions and allocate charging stations based on this and other factors .
The ChargePoint America project will collect data characterizing vehicle use and charging patterns , and Purdue University and Idaho National Labs will analyze the data .

As a self - proclaimed " citizen of the world , " President Obama should have welcomed rather than spurned international assistance to prevent BP 's underwater oil geyser from wrecking the Gulf Coast .
But spurn , he did .
Obama 's failure to waive the Jones Act still maintains a sea wall that blocks potentially helpful foreign ships from this tear - inducing mess .
The 1920 Jones Act requires that vessels operating in American waters be built , owned , and manned by Americans .
Some U.S. ship owners love this protectionist measure .
So do maritime labor unions .
When it comes to confronting unions , Obama rarely crosses that line .
On April 20 , the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded killing 11 workers , and began gushing perhaps 60,000 barrels of petroleum daily .
Three days later , the Dutch offered to sail to the rescue on ships bedecked with oil - skimming booms .
They also had a plan for erecting protective sand barricades .
" The embassy got a nice letter from the administration that said , ' Thanks , but no thanks , ' " Dutch consul general Geert Visser told the Houston Chronicle 's Loren Steffy .
Had those Dutch ships departed nearly two months ago , who knows how much oil they already would have absorbed and how many pelicans now would soar rather than soak in soapy water while wildlife experts clean their wings .
After initially refusing to name them , the State Department on May 5 declared that 11 other countries and the U.N. also had offered skimmer boats and other assets and experts to prevent the oil from destroying dolphins , crabs , oysters , and this disaster 's other defenseless victims .
Alas , they were turned away in a State Department statement .
" While there is no need right now that the U.S. cannot meet , the U.S. Coast Guard is assessing these offers of assistance to see if there will be something which we will need in the near future . "
Foreign Policy 's Josh Rogin translated this into plain English : " The current message to foreign governments is : " Thanks but no thanks , we 've got it covered . ' "
Had Obama instead waived the Jones Act via executive order — as did President Bush three days after Hurricane Katrina — that SOS would have summoned a global armada of mercy .
Who knows how many fishing , shrimping , and seafood - processing jobs this would have saved ?
Instead , thousands of Gulf Coast workers will endure a long march from dormant docks to bustling unemployment lines .
Even now , Obama could invite the world to send boats to clean the waters off Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida , and ( potentially ) the Carolinas and points north , if this mass of oil ( so far , roughly equal to 13 Exxon Valdez oil spills ) enters the Loop Current , swerves around Key West , slips into the Gulf Stream , and slides up the Eastern Seaboard .
" If there is the need for any type of waiver , that would obviously be granted , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs promised on June 10 .
" But , we 've not had that problem thus far in the Gulf . "
Problem ?
What problem ?
The Jones Act sometimes gets waived .
As Fox News Channel 's Brian Wilson reported on June 11 : " A U.S. Customs official ruled recently that the Jones Act does not apply to foreign owned vessels installing wind turbines off the coast of Delaware . "
Watching Obama last Tuesday night give his Oval Office address , BP 's brass must have been startled to hear the president say : " I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company 's recklessness . "
Should BP pay , and pay big ?
Yes .
Reckless ?
BP sure seems so .
But since when does the American president " inform " executives that they must devote billions to any cause , no matter how worthy ?
Is n't this why Congress passes legislation and courts administer justice ?
So , while a pro-labor trade barrier traps potentially helpful boats in overseas ports , due process withers under presidential diktat .
And the crude oil keeps on flowing .

Katastrophe im Kongo Tanklaster - Inferno tötet mehr als 220 Menschen
Flammendes Inferno im Osten des Kongo : Ein verunglückter Tanklaster mit 50.000 Litern Benzin an Bord war umgekippt , die Dorfbewohner versuchten gerade Benzin abzuzapfen , als die Feuerhölle losbrach .

Well , it 's a big deal to us , and we 're sensing a gross double standard , here .
We 're going to blow the lid off a steroid scandal that stretches far and wide in the world of non-athletes , and we 're not going to let our total lack of evidence slow us down .
So , let 's get this straight : A baseball player gets caught using steroids , and suddenly Congress puts the whole government on hold to have hearings about it .
But , if a rapper uses steroids , apparently we 're supposed to think it 's no big deal .
Dr. Dre
Before & After :
Here 's
Dre in the studio , looking like a fat kid who just got busted up to his forearms in leftover birthday cake ...

... and here 's
Dre presenting at last month 's VMAs .
We had to embed the video because pictures just do n't do it justice .
His muscles were so unexpectedly huge .
His formerly fat head is so disproportionately small compared with the rest of his body .
And , the long , grey underwear shirt is such a bizarre choice for a hip - hop mogul , that we were literally positive he was wearing Kevin Nealon 's costume from the Hans and Franz sketch .
We 're still not 100 percent convinced that he was n't .
He Claims :
He 's spent two hours in the gym everyday for the past four years .
So Is It Steroids ?
A Los Angeles Times article reports he has cut his body fat from 29 percent to around 6 percent in the last few years , and also describes Dre pumping his arms and saying , " I feel like I can kick a brick wall down now . "
Nope , everything sounds pretty normal there .

The ridiculous " I 'm not on steroids , I just spend all of my time in the gym " argument is a classic denial strategy that has been employed by the likes of Barry Bonds and Lance Armstrong .
It 's basically the equivalent of saying , " I 'm not on cocaine because I stay up all night dancing like a douche bag and gritting my teeth . "
We bet this guy spends a lot of his time in the gym , too .
While the L.A. Times article does n't come down on either side of the steroid debate , we 're going to side with the hip - hop bloggers , who have taken the much bolder stance of , " nigga look like the incredible hulk .
gay shit , " and more specifically , " yeah dre is full off that act right JUICE .
Lol " .

Could n't have said it better ourselves .
Why Would He Do It ?:
From 50 to the Game to Busta Rhymes , Dre 's entire Aftermath label is full of guys who look like , and wear shirts about as often as , professional wrestlers .
Regardless of the reason , it makes us long for the days when rappers wore North Face in the summer and let their glocks do the talking for them .

The 20 billion fund should be viewed as a huge accomplishment for Obama .
He had no actual power to compel that aside from moral suasion and the threat of having an unhappy president .
Legally , BP could have just waited for the lawsuits and drawn the whole thing out for years .
As a lawyer , I find it a unique and mind - boggling accomplishment .
It reminds me a little of something that happened during the Hurrican Rita evacuation .
It was going to slowly and endangering the evacuees .
Houston Mayor Bill
White got on the phone to the Texas Department of Highways .
He said , “ make all the lanes of I.H. 45 one way north for the first hundred miles from the coast –the southbound traffic can find another route . ”
He had no power to order that .
But the officials just complied .
He acted like a man in charge .
So , Obama comes along , says “ set up a 20 billion fund , have an independent administrator in charge , and start paying damages . ”
He had no power to order that .
But BP said , “ yes , sir . ”
And it was done .
We should n’t be nitpicking the particulars of it .

Dozens of ships in the Gulf of Mexico are preparing to leave the site of the BP oil spill as Tropical Storm Bonnie gathers pace .
Incident commander Admiral Thad Allen said the well would remain capped while ships evacuated the Gulf .
Drilling on a relief well has been suspended for up to two weeks .
Bonnie is the second named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , with wind speeds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , the US National Hurricane Center says .
Forecasters say the edge of the tropical storm could reach the spill area by early on Saturday .
It has already caused flooding in Haiti , Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and is moving north - west over the Bahamas , according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami .
Many of the boats and drilling rigs responding to the oil spill were preparing to move to safety from Thursday night , said Adm Allen .
" This includes the rig drilling the relief well that will ultimately kill the well , as well as other vessels needed for containment , " he said .
The operation to permanently block the well would be delayed , but " the safety of individuals at the well site is our highest concern , " Adm Allen said .
Vessels were being positioned in a way that would allow crews " to promptly re-start oil mitigation efforts as soon as the storm passes , " he added .
A " packer " - a plug used during storms - has been placed in the relief well to stabilise it while workers leave the site .
Earlier on Thursday , Adm Allen said increasing confidence in the security of a new cap placed on the leaking well had convinced scientists it would be safe to leave the capped well unmonitored for several days .
' Encouraged ' by results
The damaged well was closed off eight days ago while tests were being carried out to see if there are weaknesses in the well or ruptures in the sea bed .
Image caption The Development Driller II has been drilling one of the two relief wells
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said US Energy Secretary Steven Chu and other experts had been " encouraged " by the results so far .
Senior BP official Doug Suttles said a week with no new leakage had improved the situation on the surface , with skimmers picking up vastly reduced quantities of oil .
Skimming has gone from 25,000 barrels of oil a day before the cap was put on to just 56 barrels on Wednesday .
The government is to reopen one - third of the closed Gulf fishing areas , as oil has not been observed for 30 days .
Earlier , US President Barack Obama announced he would take his family on holiday to Florida 's Gulf Coast for the weekend of 14 August .
' Static kill '
Permission for BP to test the well was conditional on seismic , acoustic and visual monitoring - all of which will stop during the evacuation of the site .

The first relief well is only 4ft from the damaged well horizontally , but more work needs to be done before it can be used for a " kill " to stop the flow permanently .
A final piece of casing needs to be cemented in place at the bottom of the relief well .
BP executive Kent Wells said on Thursday the oil giant had been given permission to begin preparing for " static " kill - pumping mud into the top of the well through the new cap - which is being viewed as an intermediate measure .
BP is awaiting final approval from Adm Allen on whether to move forward with the process .
Eleven workers on the BP - leased rig were killed when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on 20 April and the oil has caused one of America 's worst environmental disasters .
The New York Times has reported that a safety survey by the Lloyd 's Register Group found pieces of equipment on the Deepwater Horizon Rig - which belonged to Transocean - had not been tested since 2000 , despite guidelines recommending testing every three to five years .
A spokesman for Transocean said the company had an " unwavering commitment to safety " and the survey had found that the overall maintenance of the rig exceeded required standards .
Death toll expected to rise as India faces record temperatures of up to 122 F in hottest summer on record
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Record temperatures in northern India have claimed hundreds of lives in what is believed to be the hottest summer in the country since records began in the late 1800s .
The death toll is expected to rise with experts forecasting temperatures approaching 50C ( 122 F ) in coming weeks .
More than 100 people are reported to have died in the state of Gujarat where the mercury topped at 48.5C last week .
At least 90 died in Maharashtra , 35 in Rajasthan and 34 in Bihar .
Hospitals in Gujarat have been receiving around 300 people a day suffering from food poisoning and heat stroke , ministers said .
Officials admit the figures are only a fraction of the total as most of the casualties are found in remote rural villages .
Wildlife and livestock has also suffered with voluntary organisations in Gujarat reporting the deaths of bats and crows and dozens of peacocks reported dead at a forest reserve in Uttar Pradesh .
" Because of the heat , lakes and other water bodies have been reduced to parched land , making dehydration common in such birds , " said Neeraj Srivastava , a wildlife campaigner .
Even India 's northern hill stations – historically a refuge from the heat – have not escaped .
Temperatures in Shimla , recorded a peak temperature of 32.4 Celsius , eight degrees hotter than the seasonal average .
After a drought last year , India 's farmers are now impatient for the arrival of the monsoon , which irrigates 60 % of India 's fields .
National meteorologists have forecast " normal " rains for this year , a relief in a country where prices of basic foodstuffs have rocketed in recent months due to growing shortages and structural problems with agriculture .
Forecasters have predicted that the south - west monsoon could arrive over the southern state of Kerala as early as today , but it is unlikely to reach the parched north before the end of June .
" It 's too long to wait .
We 'll all go mad before , " said Sanjoy Kumar , who sells dumplings from a stall in south Delhi .
The capital has sweltered under intense heat for weeks though , having endured temperatures of around 45 C last week , dust storms and scattered rain brought some relief over the weekend .
The new air - conditioned metro has seen record numbers of passengers as travellers abandon buses , taxis and auto rickshaws .
Parts of the city have suffered prolonged electricity blackouts and , in outlying suburbs , water shortages .
In upmarket Mehrauli village , residents were forced to buy from private suppliers plying door to door with tankers .
In the new town of Gurgaon , entire apartment blocks have run short .
In the city of Nagpur , Maharashtra , petrol pumps ran dry after railway wagons which normally carry fuel were switched to supply water .
The Indian Meterological Department attributes the record heat to lack of atmospheric humidity , hot dry winds blowing across the south - western Thar desert and the effects of last year 's El Nino cycle .
Mean temperatures for both March and April were the highest in more than 100 years .
Columnists have wondered why , given that scorching temperatures in India are inevitable , the heat has become the centre of every conversation .
For Jug Suraiya , a well - known writer , the answer lies in the concept of karma and rebirth .
" That 's why we moan and bitch and bellyache , " Suraiya explained in The Times of India newspaper .
" Because by doing so we hope in our next incarnation , life will , in all senses of the term , be cool . "
Foam Rolling
Originally printed in Training and Conditioning Magazine December 2006
Foam Roller ?
A decade ago strength and conditioning coaches , athletic trainers , and physical therapists would have looked quizzically at a thirty six inch long round piece of foam and wondered " What is that for ? " .
Today nearly every athletic training room and most strength conditioning facilities contain an array of foam rollers in different lengths and consistencies .
What happened ?
A major change in the attitude toward injury prevention and treatment has been evidenced by a huge increase in the awareness that hands on techniques like massage , Muscle Activation ( MAT ) , and Active Release Therapy ( ART ) can work wonders for injured athletes .
We appear to be moving away from the eighties injury care mode of isokinetics and electronics to a more European inspired process that focuses on hands - on soft tissue care .
The success of physical therapists with soft tissue mobilization ( the physical therapy term for massage ) and MAT , and a number of chiropractors with ART has clearly put the focus back on the muscle .
The message at the elite level is " if you want to get better ( healthier ) get a good manual therapist in your corner " .
What does all this have to do with foam rollers you might ask ?
Well .
Foam rollers are the poor mans massage therapist , soft tissue work for the masses .
As strength and conditioning coaches and personal trainers watched elite level athletes tout their success and improvement from various soft tissue techniques the obvious question arose .
How can I mass - produce " massage " or soft tissue work for large groups of athletes at a reasonable cost ?
Enter the foam roller .
Physical Therapist Mike Clark is credited by many , the author included , with the initial exposure of the athletic and physical therapy communities to the foam roller and to what he termed " self myofascial release " .
Self myofascial release is simply another technical term for self - massage .
In one of Clarke 's early manuals published as a pre-cursor to his book Integrated Training for the New Millenium Clark included a few photos of self - myofascial release techniques using a foam roller .
The technique illustrated was simple and nearly self - explanatory .
Get a foam roller and use your bodyweight to apply pressure to sore spots .
Kind of a self - accupresssure technique .
I believe these photos began a trend that is now probably a multi-million dollar business in the manufacture and sale of these simple tools .
What is a Foam Roller and How do You Use It ?
A foam roller is simply a cylindrical piece of some type of extruded hard - celled foam .
Think pool noodles but a little more dense and larger in diameter .
The techniques are simple .
Clarke 's initial recommendation was not a self - massage technique but , more the accupressure concept described previously .
Athletes or patients were simply instructed to use the roller to apply pressure to sensitive areas in the muscles .
Depending on the orientation of the therapist , these points can alternately be described as trigger points , knots or simply areas of increased muscle density .
Regardless of the name , those in the fields of athletics and rehab were familiar with the concepts of sore muscles and the need for massage .
Note :
It is the authors belief that massage fell out of favor during the physical therapy boom of the 1980's not because it was ineffective but , because it was not cost effective .
With the increase in use of modalities like ultrasound and electrical stimulation athletic trainers and therapists could treat more athletes , more rapidly .
In Europe and in elite athlete situations such as high - level track and field and swimming , a disdain for a modality based approach and an affinity for European inspired massage still existed .
Slowly , the performance world caught on to the idea that manipulation of the soft tissue caused athletes to either stay healthier or , to get healthy faster .
The use of foam rollers has progressed in many circles from an acupressure type approach to a self - massage approach .
The roller is now used to apply longer more sweeping strokes to the long muscle groups like the calves , adductors and quadriceps and small directed force to areas like the TFL , hip rotators and glute medius .
Athletes are instructed to use the roller to search for tender areas or trigger point and to roll these areas to decrease density and over - activity .
The major areas that respond well to the foam roller are :
Glute max and hip rotators - the athlete , client or patient sits on the roller with a slight tilt and moves from the iliac crest to the hip joint to address the glute max ( video ) .
To address the hip rotators the affected leg is crossed to place the hip rotator group on stretch .
As a general rule of thumb , ten slow rolls are done in each position although there are no hard and fast rules for foam rolling .
Often athletes or clients are encouraged to simply roll until the pain disappears .
Video 1
TFL and Gluteus Medius - the tensor fascia latae and gluteus medius , although small muscles , are significant factors in anterior knee pain .
To address the TFL the athlete begins with the body prone and the edge of the roller placed over the TFL , just below the iliac crest .
After working the TFL , the athlete turns ninety degrees to a side position and works from the hip joint to the iliac crest to address the gluteus medius .
Adductors - the adductors are probably the most neglected area of the lower body .
A great deal of time and energy is focused on the quadriceps and hamstring groups and very little attention paid to the adductors .
There are two methods to roll the adductors .
The first ( video 2 ) is a floor based technique that will work well for beginners .
In the floor technique the user abducts the leg over the roller and places the roller at about a 60 degree angle to the leg .
The rolling action should be done in three portions beginning just above the knee in the area of the vastus medialis and pes anserine .
Ten short rolls should be done covering about one third the length of the femur .
Next the roller should be moved to the mid point of the adductor group and again rolled ten times in the middle third of the muscle .
Last the roller should be moved high into the groin almost to the pubic symphysis .
Video 2
The secondary technique for the adductors should be used after the athlete has acclimated to the previous technique .
The secondary technique needs the use of a training room table or the top of a plyometric box ( video 3 ) .
Sitting with the leg dropped over the roller allows the athlete to shift significantly more weight onto the roller and work deeper into the large adductor triangle .
Video 3
Trainer Beware
It is important to note that foam rolling can be hard work , particularly for weaker or overweight clients as the arms are heavily involved in moving the body .
In addition , foam rolling can border on painful .
Foam rollers are available in a number of densities from relatively soft foam , slightly harder than a pool noodle , to newer high - density rollers with a much more solid feel .
The feel of the roller and the intensity of the self - massage work must be properly geared to the age , and fitness level of the client .
Good massage work , and correspondingly good self - massage work , may be uncomfortable much like stretching .
It is important that athletes or clients learn to distinguish between a moderate level of discomfort related to a trigger point and a potentially injurious situation .
Foam rolling should be used with discretion in those clients with less muscle density .
Foam rolling should never cause bruising .
The reality is that the athlete or client should feel better , not worse after a brief session with a foam roller .
When to Roll
Coaches and therapists are not in universal agreement over when to roll , how often to roll , or how long to roll so only general guidelines can be provided .
Rolling can provide great benefit both before and after a workout .
Foam rolling prior to a workout can help to decrease muscle density and allow for better warm - up .
Rolling after a workout may help to aid in recovery from strenuous exercise .
The nice thing about using the foam roller is that it appears it can be done on a daily basis .
In fact , Clair and Amber Davies in the The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook actually recommend trigger point work up to 12 times a day in situations of acute pain .
How long an athlete or client rolls is also individual .
In a personal training setting we allow 5 - 10 minutes for soft tissue work at the beginning of the session prior to warm - up .
With our athletic clients we do the same .
Foam Rollers versus Massage
The question often arises " Which is better , massage therapy or a foam roller ? " .
To me the answer is obvious .
Hands work better than foam .
Hands are directly connected to the brain and can feel .
A foam roller cannot feel .
If cost was not an issue I would have team of massage therapists on call for my athletes at all times .
However , this is simply not realistic .
Most athletes struggle to afford the services of a qualified coach or the cost of a facility membership .
At the current state of health care , prevention is generally not a covered cost for healthy athletes .
With no ability to get reimbursed the cost of massage therapy alone could approach or surpass the cost of training .
The foam roller can provide unlimited self - massage for under twenty dollars ?
You do the math .
Conclusion
The use of foam rollers has exploded over the past ten years and will continue to increase .
Athletic trainers in high school or small college situations can teach their athletes to perform hands on treatment that might not have been possible due to work schedules , while strength and conditioning coaches can provide a form of massage therapy to all of their athletes .
Foam rollers are a small investment to make to see a potentially significant decrease in the number of soft tissue / non-contact injuries .

Thiruvananthapuram : A professor of the Newman College in Thodupuzha , central Kerala , who has been under suspension over a controversial question in an examination paper , had his right hand hacked .
He suffered other grievous injuries in a morning attack Sunday by unidentified assailants .
The professor , T.J. Joseph , was returning from church around 8 am local time when a gang armed with weapons including knives and axes pulled him out of the car in Muvattupuzha and hacked his hand .
His 83 - year - old mother and his sister , a nun , witnessed the incident .
Joseph had been suspended after one of the questions he gave his students in March this year was considered defamatory to Islam .
Following the incident yesterday , police were immediately on the investigation trail and found a car in which the assailants were suspected to have travelled to commit the crime .
The vehicle was traced to Nellikunnu near Muvattupuzha .
The assailants threw Joseph 's severed hand away before fleeing .
It was later recovered .
Joseph was rushed first to a hospital in Muvattupuzha and later to a hospital in Kochi where he underwent surgery .
" There were many people in the car .
They broke the windows of our car with axes and pulled him out and hacked him , " Joseph 's sister , Sr Stella , who was visiting him , said .
Joseph 's octogenarian mother also suffered minor injuries in the incident .
The chilling incident shocked the state .
Home Minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said it had to be investigated whether the assailants had any links to fundamental groups or terrorist organisations .
Indian Union Muslim League chief Panakkad Hyderali Shihab
Thangal was among the first to condemn the crime .
Catholic church spokesperson Stephen Alathara said the professor had been suspended for his controversial act , and that a wrong cannot be corrected with another wrong .
Costa Ricans suspect ‘ ulterior motive ’ in permitting large numbers of US troops
Opposition leaders in Costa Rica are up in arms over an agreement between the country and the United States that reportedly allows 46 US warships and 7,000 US Marines to enter the country as part of an anti-drug effort .
According to several Costa Rican news sources , the government there signed an agreement with the US last week to extend an 11 - year - old cooperative program aimed at eradicating the maritime drug trade .
ADVERTISEMENT
But opponents say this year ’s deal differs from previous ones in that it allows US warships to enter the country .
Previously , opponents say , only US Coast Guard vessels were allowed to enter Costa Rican territory .
The new agreement expires on December 31 of this year .
A committee of the People ’s Movement political party said the deal turns Costa Rica into a “ US protectorate ” and brings the country into “ a new phase of military occupation , ” according to the Costa Rican newspaper El Pais .
Costa Rica ’s Nacion newspaper reported last week that the new agreement will see 7,000 US Marines , supported by 200 helicopters and 46 warships , “ enter and leave the country at will . ”
The paper also cited a June 2 letter from Costa Rica to the US declaring that US troops will have “ the right to carry out the activities it deems necessary in carrying out its mission . ”
Inside Costa Rica reports that opposition leaders see the US military force as disproportionately large compared to the problem of Central American drug- running .
Luis Fishman , head of the Christian Social Unity Party , said the deal amounts to a “ blank check ” for US forces in Costa Rica .
“ We cannot support the illegal ; we cannot allow our Constitution to be trampled , ” he said , as quoted by ICR .

Inside Costa Rica reports :
FA legislator JosÃƒÂ© MarÃƒÂ­a Villalta questioned the conditions under which the permission was granted , since US personnel “ will enjoy freedom of movement and the right to carry out the activities needed to fulfill their mission ” .
The FA also urged consideration of the geopolitical situation in which naval forces will be allowed to enter a region considered by Washington as part of its sphere of influence .
The legislator recalled that the US applies in the region a “ strategy of complete dominance ” , which includes offensive actions such as the coup d’etat in Honduras and the installation of military bases in Colombia .
Writing at Inside Costa Rica , John Holtz says the fact that the deal allows such a large US troop presence , allows warships rather than Coast Guard vehicles , and expires rapidly at the end of this year , has made many Costa Ricans suspicious of the US and Costa Rican governments ’ motives .

“ This story is not going away and for sure the proÃ¢â‚¬â€ œcon arguments will grow exponentially as will the theories and hidden agenda accusations .
A military presence of this magnitude on foreign soil with what amounts to be a ‘ blank check ’ is serious stuff and fodder for speculation , ” he writes .
The US State Department says the US - Costa Rica Maritime Cooperation Agreement , first signed in 1999 , “ facilitates cooperation between the Coast Guard of Costa Rica and the US Coast Guard . ”

It says the program “ has resulted in a growing number of narcotics seizures , illegal migrant rescues , illegal fishing seizures , and search - and - rescue missions . ”
*** USA - ACTION ALERT *** FDA Steps Up Enforcement Against Raw Milk THE RAID
On April 20 , two FDA agents , two federal marshals and one state trooper descended on the Kinzer , Pennsylvania farm ( Rainbow Acres ) of Dan Allgyer to execute an administrative search warrant against Allgyer 's premises .
The group set foot on the farm at 5 a .m. to conduct the inspection even though the warrant called for the inspection to take place " at reasonable times during reasonable business hours . "
The warrant allowed the FDA agents to inspect " all portions of Rainbow Acres facility ( except for the private residence located therein ) and all things therein , including all equipment , finished and unfinished materials , containers and labeling therein . "
The warrant also called for the " use of reasonable force " to gain entry to any area the agents were authorized to search .
Later that day after the agents reported their findings to officials at FDA 's Philadelphia district office , Philadelphia District Director Kirk Sooter sent Allgyer a warning letter stating that FDA had determined that " you are causing to be delivered into interstate commerce , selling or otherwise distributing raw milk in final package form for human consumption , such distribution is a violation of the Public Health Service ( PHS ) Act , Title 42 United States Code , Section 264 ( a ) , and the implementing regulation codified in Title 21 , Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) , Section 1240.61 ( a ) . "
THE INTERSTATE BAN
The regulation [ 21 CFR 1240.61 ( a ) ] issued by FDA in response to a 1988 court order provides , in part , that " no person shall cause to be delivered into interstate commerce or shall sell , otherwise distribute , or hold for sale or other distribution after shipment in interstate commerce any milk or milk product in final package form for direct human consumption unless the product has been pasteurized . "
The statute [ 42 USC 264 ( a ) ] authorizing FDA to issue the regulation prohibiting raw milk for human consumption in interstate commerce provides , in part , " The Surgeon General , with the approval of the Secretary , is authorized to make and enforce such regulations as in his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction , transmission , or spread of communicable diseases ... from one state or possession into any other state or possession . "
In FDA 's view all raw milk is a communicable disease and is " adulterated " ; so , a product that is legal to sell under the laws of two neighboring states is a " communicable disease " and illegal when it crosses from one neighboring state into another .
The federal ban on raw milk is a prohibition on a product that is legal to sell or distribute in at least twenty - nine ( 29 ) states and legal to consume in all fifty ( 50 ) .
FDA ’S STRATEGY TO TARGET FARMERS & ACHIEVE STATE-BY - STATE BANS
In spite of the booming demand for raw milk , FDA 's position has not changed .
The agency is at the center of the opposition to raw milk and wants a complete ban on the product 's sale and distribution .
In the Chicago area , the FDA has targeted for enforcement ( one at a time ) twenty ( 20 ) different buying clubs the agency suspects of having obtained raw milk from out - of - state sources .
FDA has a similar strategy for the states , with the plan being to pressure one state at a time to ban raw milk sales .
If the food safety legislation currently before Congress passes , FDA will have increased leverage over the states so this threat will be greater ; the agency does not have the manpower to conduct the inspections mandated by the food safety bill (s ) and will in effect be putting state agriculture and health department employees on the federal payroll to carry out its workload .
In taking action against farms , like Rainbow Acres , whom FDA suspects of transporting raw milk across state lines , the agency is attempting to deny the people 's right to obtain the food of their choice from the source of their choice .
FDA allows Vioxx , Avandia , melamine , aspartame , and genetically modified foods on the market but is now trying to take off the market a food that has benefited human health for thousands of years .
Interestingly , there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution nor in any Supreme Court decision that specifically mentions freedom of food choice .
Freedom of food choice is ' the rights issue ' of the twenty - first century ; ultimately , consumers will be the ones to win the fight .
RAW MILK & YOUR FREEDOM OF FOOD CHOICE
Raw milk is at the heart of the battle for food freedom .
The key to securing the right to obtain raw milk from the source of choice is to overturn the federal ban ; without the ban , FDA will not be able to put the pressure on states that it currently does to make raw milk sales and distribution illegal .
Efforts are being made to overturn the ban .
In February of this year , the Farm - to - Consumer Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit in federal district court seeking a court ruling that the federal ban is unconstitutional as applied to its members and other individual plaintiffs .
Congressman Ron Paul last year introduced HR 778 , a bill that would effectively overturn 21 CFR 1240.61 .
Readers can do their part to help by contacting FDA and asking that the agency not harass farmers like Dan Allgyer whom the agency suspects of transporting raw milk across state lines .
John F. Sheehan , the Director of FDA 's Division of Plant and Dairy Food , is the official most responsible for carrying out FDA 's agenda of completely banning the sale and distribution of raw milk .
Sheehan has stated : " Raw milk should not be consumed by anyone , at any time , for any reason . "
TAKE ACTION
Call , fax and / or write Mr. Sheehan at the contact information provided below , telling him to leave Dan Allgyer alone .
Here are some points to make :
1. FDA should respect the right of consumers to obtain the food of their choice .
2. FDA has no business trying to deny consumers the right to drink raw milk since consumption of raw milk is legal in all fifty states .
3. Consumers are perfectly capable of making food choices for themselves and their families and do n't want FDA dictating what foods they should and should not consume .
4 . If FDA has no choice but to “ enforce the law ” then the agency should advocate for overturning that law .
A sample letter to Mr. Sheehan can be found here .
NOTE : FDA has never taken action against any individual obtaining raw milk for their own consumption from another State ; but it is possible that FDA could interpret the ban to include prohibiting even consumers from crossing state lines to get raw milk .
FTCLDF strongly disagrees with this interpretation and takes the position that people have the right to cross state lines to obtain the foods of their choice .

— A Superior Court judge has ordered the release of a Winston - Salem man who has spent 20 years in a state mental institution after being found not guilty by reason of insanity of killing four people and wounding five others .
Michael Hayes , 46 , could be released from Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh within the next few weeks , his longtime attorney , Karl Knudsen , said Tuesday .
During a two - day hearing last week , seven psychologists and psychiatrists testified that Hayes is not dangerous and no longer suffers from a personality disorder .
" He is completely cured .
He is a much wiser , more mature , more stable person now than he was , even five or 10 years ago , " Knudsen said .
" For the last 20 years he has n't been on any kind of psycho- active medication and has really shown any signs of mental illness for I would contend at least 15 years . "
Hayes has said he thought he was killing demons in human bodies when he shot his victims at a rural crossroads in 1988 .
Doctors have said he suffered a psychotic break brought on by drug and alcohol abuse .
A case manager must first determine if Hayes can meet conditions that Judge Steve Balog set Friday .
Those conditions include submitting to random drug tests and searches and attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings .
He also cannot own any guns and cannot go to Forsyth County – where the shootings occurred – or out of the state .
Knudsen said Hayes plans to move to Wendell to live his girlfriend and their two children .
Hayes has been held at the state - run Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh since he was found not guilty in 1989 .
Over the years , he has been granted privileges that allow him to spend much of his time away from Dix .
He works 40 to 60 hours a week as an assistant manager at a convenience store and has unsupervised visits for up to a week with his girlfriend and children .
" He 's been out in the community , and really , for the last several years , mostly what he 's been doing at the hospital is sleeping , " Knudsen said .
Balog , who will review the case after a year to make sure he has met the conditions of his release , also ordered that Hayes must stay employed to remain free , and he must go to counseling for his relationship with his girlfriend .
Family members of Hayes ' victims say they think he should remain in custody .
" He 's never been punished for what he did , " Linda Cantrell , who lost her 16 - year - old daughter , Crystal , in the shooting spree , told the Winston - Salem Journal on Friday .

It was messy , violent and bruising .
But Prime Minister Stephen Harper insists the summit that turned Toronto ’s downtown into an armed fortress and sparked window - smashing protests and mass arrests was all worth it .
“ We obviously deplore the actions of a few thugs .
But the reality is , unfortunately , that these summits attract this element and ( that ) has been a problem , as we know , around the world , ” Harper said as the G20 summit wrapped up Sunday afternoon .
“ That said , I think that goes a long way to explaining why we have the kind of security costs around these summits that we do , ” Harper said .
His fellow leaders , who were well - shielded from the turmoil on the streets , gave Toronto an enthusiastic thumb ’s up , with U.S. President Barack Obama thanking “ our wonderful hosts . ”
“ The success of these summits — the G - 8 in Muskoka and the G - 20 here in Toronto — is a tribute to Canadian leadership , ” Obama said .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , asked about the value of Canada ’s billion - dollar - summit , said it ’s always useful for world leaders to meet face - to - face , particularly at the G20 , which represents 85 per cent of the world ’s economy .
“ Each summit is not historic for the content of its decisions , but each time it ’s important that we have these discussions , ” he said .
The reviews might not be so glowing on the streets of Toronto , where summit hang - over — and the clean - up — promises to linger well into the week .
But Harper said the costs and the hassles that go with a summit are the price to be paid to be a member of the global economy .
“ It ’s not really a Canadian economy anymore .
It is a global economy , ” Harper said .
“ That ’s why it ’s so critical that we participate and play a major role , because Canadian jobs and Canadian futures are intimately linked to what goes on here , ” he said .
Indeed , for Harper and his Conservatives , who had taken bruising criticism for their eye - popping bill for summit security , the rioters who busted store windows and torched cop cars may have done the government a favour .
Government officials did n’t say it in so many words , but there was a “ told - you - so ” tone to their comments as they praised the thousands of police officers — part of a security bill that totaled nearly $ 1 billion — for holding the line against “ thugs . ”
“ Our police services did a magnificent job to ensure that these thugs do n’t rampage around the city wreaking more havoc , ” said Dimitri Soudas , Harper ’s director of communications , earlier Sunday .
But Ned Franks , a retired Queen ’s University political science professor , said it is odd for the Conservative government to crow about the great job police did when the downtown was ransacked .
“ Yes , ( police ) did a fine job of protecting the participants in the G20 but that ’s about as far as it went .
The city itself was left pretty vulnerable , ” he said .
“ Will Toronto feel happy about hosting it ( the G20 ) ?
I think the answer is no , ” Franks said .
Still , a single afternoon of violent protest helped blunt weeks of criticism aimed at the Conservatives over the $ 1.1 - billion price tag for the back - to - back summits , the G8 in Huntsville and the G20 in Toronto .
More than 80 per cent of that spending went to pay for the massive security operation that saw officers brought in from across the country and turned downtown Toronto into an armed , fenced fortress .
As police and protesters squared off for a second consecutive day Sunday , the Prime Minister ’s office insisted the billion - dollar tab for summit security was money well - spent , saying officers saved the city from a broader rampage .
From the “ get - go , ” Ottawa ’s goal was to ensure that not only “ the delegates , the leaders and over 3,700 international media . . . were able to do that in a secure way , but ultimately the importance of making sure the citizens of Toronto also feel safe , ” Soudas said .
“ What we saw ( Saturday ) was a bunch of thugs that pretend to have a difference of opinion with policies and instead choose violence to express those so - called differences , ” he said .

But there were questions about police , who appeared more focused on protecting the summit site — and the downtown hotels housing the leaders — than safeguarding downtown businesses that got hit by protesters .
Security expert Alan Bell said the primary goal of police is to protect the security zone sheltering the G20 leaders , and that is likely why anarchists were able to smash windows and burn police cruisers in the streets .
“ They were well aware of the fact that the anarchists were inclined to draw police attention away from their primary role by having these types of rampages , ” Bell said .
“ There have been no serious injuries and there have been no deaths .
There has been vandalism .
You can repair vandalism , but you ca n’t repair people who get injured or killed , so that ’s one way to look at it . ”
Still , Bell said holding the summit in a different location would have been a better way to keep it safe than spending an unprecedented amount of money on security .
The protests only sparked further questions about why the Conservatives decided to locate the G20 gathering smack in the heart of Canada ’s largest city , knowing it would make Toronto ’s downtown ground zero for riots and protests .
NDP Leader Jack Layton said the Conservative government is left with a “ black eye ” as result of G20 - related rioting .
“ What we see here so clearly demonstrates that the Harper government did not plan this photo - opportunity meeting properly at all .
If fact , it was predictable … that what we saw here would unfold , ” he said .
Layton said the billion dollars worth of security did n’t prevent the violence .
Liberal MP Mark Holland ( Ajax — Pickering ) said the last - minute decision to host the G20 in Toronto gave officials only a few months to prepare , while Huntsville had a couple of years to get ready for the G8 .
“ They left police with very little time to respond and they put it right in downtown Toronto , and that is why we had this situation and that is why we had this mess unfold , ” Holland said .
But Soudas defended Toronto ’s selection as the summit site , saying a big city was the only option given the need for hotel rooms and work space to accommodate almost 4,000 media and 10,000 delegates .
“ It is very difficult to do it , for example , in Muskoka , because there would be no accommodations , ” Soudas said .

A spokesman of Chinese Foreign Ministry made remarks on Saturday on a demonstrator 's harassment of a Chinese delegation outside New Zealand 's parliament building on Friday .
At the invitation of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key , Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping paid an official visit to New Zealand starting on June 17 .
He was warmly welcomed and well received by the government and people of New Zealand .
The visit yielded positive results .
When the delegation arrived at the entrance of the parliament building in Wellington Friday noon , it was hostilely harassed by a New Zealand demonstrator within close distance .
The demonstrator 's behavior posed a threat to the security and dignity of the delegation , and far exceeded the boundaries of the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly .
Such an attempt to spoil the atmosphere of Xi's visit and damage the Sino - New Zealand relationship is doomed to fail .
It also runs against the common wish of both Chinese people and New Zealanders to enhance bilateral friendship , he added .
New Zealand has apologized to the Chinese side for the incident .
DARRELL THE CON MAN ; DARRELL THE CAR THIEF ?
In this article from the San Francisco Chronicle , we see the interesting story of Darrell and his brother , who set up a phony car theft and then sold the " stolen " car to a Mercedes - Benz dealer .
In the San Jose case , Issa , who at the time was a 27 - year - old U.S. Army officer , and William Issa , 29 , were arrested by San Jose police on a felony auto - theft charge in February 1980 .
They were accused of a scheme in which Issa 's brother allegedly sold Issa 's cherry - red Mercedes 240 to Smythe European Motors in San Jose for $ 13,000 cash and three $ 1,000 traveler 's checks .
Within hours , Issa reported the car stolen from a lot at the Monterey airport , near his Army post at Fort Ord. Issa and his brother pleaded not guilty .
A judge ordered them to stand trial on felony charges , saying he had a " strong suspicion " that the men had committed the crime , according to the records .
The case was not prosecuted because the DA did n't think he had a strong enough case , even though strong suspicions still surrounded the Issa brothers .
Darrell was also suspected in involvement with two other car thefts , but he blamed his brother William for both of them and denied any wrongdoing .
At the time the Chronicle published this article , by the way , Issa was spearheading the movement to recall California Governor Gray Davis , a movement which eventually led to the disastrous governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger .
You will recall that this recall campaign aided and abetted Enron 's looting of California via the phony " electricity crisis " .
DARRELL THE TOOL OF BIG BUSINESS ; DARRELL THE ARSONIST ?
The Media Matters Action Network has assembled a synopsis of Issa 's wretched , scandal - plagued political career right here .
Among the interesting findings :
AC Custom Fire : Flammable Liquid Had " Been Poured On The Only Area Not Covered By Fire Sprinklers . "
The Los Angeles Times reported that " seven months after Issa took control , " a fire broke out at the " Quantum manufacturing plant . "
" Case files from Maple Heights , the Ohio fire marshal and insurers pointed repeatedly to the likelihood of arson in the blaze , which officials estimated caused $ 800,000 in damage .
Although an accident could not be ruled out , the uneven and unnatural burn patterns made the blaze ' suspicious in nature , ' the state concluded two months later .
Flammable liquid appeared to have been poured on the only area not covered by fire sprinklers , investigators found . "
[ Los Angeles Times , 5/23/98 , via Nexis , emphasis added ]
Issa Has Received Nearly $ 40,000 From The National Beer Wholesalers Association .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Issa has received a total of $ 38,500 from the National Beer Wholesalers Association ( NBWA ) in contributions since 2000 .
[ Center for Responsive Politics , accessed 2/3/10 ] NBWA Was A Leading Supporter Of Bush Tax Breaks .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics : " The NBWA ... was a leading supporter of President Bush 's proposed package of business tax breaks in 2001 . "
[ Center for Responsive Politics , accessed 5/31/10 ]
Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) Has Given Issa More Than $ 64,000 Since 2000 .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Issa has received $ 64,150 in total contributions from the company Science Applications International Corporation from 2000 - 2010 .
[ Center for Responsive Politics , accessed 2/3/10 ] SAIC Produced Faulty Software For The FBI .
According to SignOnSanDiego.com : " SAIC 's custom software , known as Virtual Case File , was intended to help FBI agents and analysts track terrorists and manage criminal investigations .
When SAIC delivered the product , [ FBI Director Robert Mueller testified that ] at least 400 problems were found with the software . "
The contract between SAIC and the FBI was worth " 170 million dollars . "

DARRELL THE ENEMY OF SIMPLE HUMAN DECENCY
In PERRspectives 's " Top 10 Darrell Issa Hall of Shame Moments " , ( located here ) we find the following tidbits :
Issa Calls 9/11 Attacks in New York a Plane Crash
No doubt , Issa 's slur against World Trade Center rescue workers was the most unforgettable moment in a truly forgettable political career .
Desperate to refuse federal funds to the ailing workers who rushed to Ground Zero , Issa denied the September 11 carnage was an attack on the United States at all .
As the New York Post summed it up : " It 's very simple : I can't vote for additional money for New York if I can't see why it would be appropriate to do this every single time a similar situation happens , which quite frankly includes any urban terrorist .
It does n't have to be somebody from al Qaeda .
It can be someone who decides that they do n't like animal testing at one of our pharmaceutical facilities . "
Issa said the destruction of the World Trade Center did not involve a dirty bomb or a chemical weapon designed to make people sick .
" It simply was an aircraft , residue of the aircraft and residue of the materials used to build this building , " Issa said .
Issa also viciously defended Blackwater from charges of committing atrocities , and accused those investigating Blackwater of " going after the troops " ( ! ) .
He further accused Valerie Plame of perjury , and helped force out federal prosecutor Carol Lam with a phony report accusing her of " lax " enforcement of the immigration laws .
The purge of Lam was done in retaliation for her successful prosecution of the crook " Duke " Cunningham .
Oh , and Issa also fought against a bill protecting homeowners from predatory lenders .
DARRELL THE PATHOLOGICAL DAMNED LIAR
Issa lied repeatedly and brazenly in the Countrywide VIP loan scandal .
Issa lied about evidence and lied about the involvement of Democrats in the matter .
Issa also blatantly lied about the so - called " Train to Sin City " , a non-existent piece of the stimulus plan that supposedly financed a high speed train from LA to Las Vegas at the behest of Harry Reid .
David Shuster shot Issa down HARD , calling him on his lie in no uncertain terms .
( You can see it here since , for some reason , the video will not embed . )
Issa also blatantly lied when he claimed , in a debate with Debbie Wasserman Schultz , that the Republicans had been shut out of helping to shape Health Care Reform .
Wasserman Schultz was having none of it :
Following the vote on the health care bill , Wolf Blitzer talks to Rep. Darrell Issa and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz .
Issa claims that the Republicans were " shut out of the process from the very beginning " and Wasserman Schultz calls him out on it .
Schultz :
That is just a brazenly false statement .
From the very beginning ...
Issa :
Is that like you lied ?
Schultz :
No , it 's a brazenly false ( crosstalk ) .
With all due respect there are two hundred amendments that were offered and accepted by Republicans , offered by Republicans and accepted by Democrats and incorporated into this bill .
This is a bill that is bipartisan in content , unfortunately not bipartisan in the outcome of the votes .
We gave every opportunity over and over again and the American people saw a President in Obama extend his hand and saw Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid ask Republicans repeatedly to sit down with the rest of the negotiating table and we were repeatedly rejected .
After Issa pretends like they would have used the amendment process for anything other than trying to either stall or shut down the bill being passed and Blitzer repeating his Republican talking points about major pieces of social legislation never being passed without bipartisan support Schultz comes back again .
Schultz :
It passed without any Republican support by their choice .
Issa has also lied about his own military service :
As several politicians have been snared thanks to fibbing about their military records , TPM took a trip down memory lane exploring others who exaggerated service .
It turns out that 12 years ago when Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) was running for Senate , the San Francisco Examiner uncovered that his Army record was in doubt .
The Examiner published in May 1998 a devastating article detailing the conflicts between Issa ’s public statements and public records .
A focus in the story was Issa ’s claim he protected then - President Richard Nixon as part of an “ elite Army bomb unit ” at the World Series in 1971 .
But it turns out Nixon did n’t even attend the games .
The Examiner scoured military records and concluded that Issa ’s service on the squad “ was marred by a bad conduct rating , a demotion and allegations that he had stolen a fellow soldier ’s car . ”
It cited his 1998 campaign biography saying he served in the Army nine years , even though records showed he served just over five years .
In Darrell Issa we are facing one of the very worst , most dishonest , most unprincipled , most corrupt , most fanatically right - wing of our opponents .
He lacks any shred of decency or concern for the average person .
And it is this despicable , loathsome , pathologically lying man who will use his power to ruin President Obama unless we act to stop him , by getting out the Democratic vote in November .
It 's simple : either we vote , or this son of a bitch Issa gets to ruin the United States of America .

US - based boffins say they have created a never - seen - before type of ultra - bizarre stuff in the lab by using incredible pressures similar to those found deep inside planets .
The scientists believe that their creation is capable of storing an unfeasible amount of energy .
" It is the most condensed form of energy storage outside of nuclear energy , " says Choong - Shik Yoo , chemistry prof at Washington State uni .
Yoo and his colleagues created " novel two - and three - dimensional extended non-molecular phases " of xenon difluoride ( XeF 2 ) by squashing their samples incredibly viciously .
This was done using two small " anvils " made of diamond , rammed together by powerful machinery .
The diamond anvil moleculo - juicer rig was eventually cranked to 100 Giga - Pascals and beyond - more than a million times ordinary atmospheric pressure - the style of pressure one would be under halfway to the Earth 's core .
The large amounts of energy used in the squashage were " stored as chemical energy in the molecules ' bonds " , according to the scientists .
A statement issued by Washington State says :
Possible future applications include creating a new class of energetic materials or fuels , an energy storage device , super - oxidizing materials for destroying chemical and biological agents , and high - temperature superconductors .
It sounds as though one might be talking here not so much about a new class of super - powered batteries as something more akin to rocket fuel or explosives ( although of course any sufficiently good energy storage method has the potential to be a bomb or at least a fire hazard if things go wrong , as we know well from li-ion gadget batteries ) .
Perhaps the space ships of tomorrow will lift easily into orbit without the need for troublesome , expensive disposable boosters , powered by super - energetic ultrapressure explodo wonder - fuel .
Certainly the comedy iPod trouser disasters of tomorrow seem likely to be worth watching out for - possibly of mushroom - cloud magnitude , from what professor Yoo suggests .

The Madness within Us : Schizophrenia as a Neuronal Process
by Robert Freedman
Oxford University Press , 2009 . 198 pages .
$ 35.00 ( hardcover )
A perusal of The Madness within Us : Schizophrenia as a Neuronal Process is well worth the time of anyone interested in schizophrenia research .
Author Robert Freedman is a clinician and scholar who also has a family history of schizophrenia .
Inspired by Harry Stack Sullivan ’s classic work , Schizophrenia as a Human Process , Freedman writes poignantly of the experiences of his patients and the struggles of their families , providing us with a very human sense of what it means to experience and bear witness to psychosis .
In addition , Freedman provides a highly accessible and rich overview of the latest schizophrenia research from neurobiology , animal modeling , developmental and genetic studies .
Freedman begins with historical and biblical accounts of schizophrenia symptoms .
He also introduces us to two modern families , one whose son Paul develops schizophrenia at college and another in which two siblings ultimately develop schizophrenia , as well as the son of one of the siblings who does not have schizophrenia .
The family ’s stories provide a riveting depiction of the mysterious ways that polygenetic patterns in a family ’s genome can be correlated with neurobiological conditions and their phenotypes , which are made manifest in family member ’s lives as genius , as sensitivity , as creativity , and sometimes as schizophrenia .
Freedman begins his neurobiological explanations of schizophrenia by asking what people with schizophrenia cannot do .
Sensory gating deficits and the role of the P50 evoked potential studies are then described in detail .
Freedman also provides an overview of phenotype research on schizophrenia , for example , P50 inhibition as a possible phenotype of sensory gating deficits attributed to specific genes .
He discusses the complexity of research on phenotypes in schizophrenia and the possible role of endophenotypes , such as intestinal polyps , which are difficult to detect .
The search for phenotypes and possible correlating genotypes continues .
The latest research on alpha - 7 nicotinic receptors , their role in sensory gating , and their potential as a target for novel pharmacological interventions — and the refusal of drug companies to investigate this possibility — are also presented in a very accessible manner .
Freedman believes sensory flooding and difficulty with emotional regulation — the possible byproduct of aforementioned neurobiological deficits , genetic characteristics , and experience — are the foundation of suspicious thought in people who develop schizophrenia .
Every human , Freedman explains , develops stories in their minds to deal with their everyday experiences , but people with schizophrenia tend to have paranoid narratives that only confirm the fears and sense of worthlessness .
This is followed by a “ failure of correction , ” or an inability to test one ’s beliefs in reality and realize that they are not true .
Finally , people with schizophrenia experience profound conviction that their beliefs are true , which he compares to the experience of religious conversion .
Freedman speculates that an inability to correct false beliefs , particularly in highly intelligent people with schizophrenia , may come from “ accelarated learning ability , or alternatively , diminished forgetting , particularly in human beings ” ( 111 ) .
He offers a neural explanation for this involving regions of the hippocampus .
Overall , Freedman indicates that a neuronal inability to filter out incoming sensory experiences along with a delusional reaction to this experience that is never corrected — characterize what we think of clinically as schizophrenia .
He claims his understanding of schizophrenia “ is not one of deficit ; rather for patients it is one of enhancement of brain function , albeit increasingly beyond their control ” ( 114-115 ) .
Freedman concludes by encouraging us to think of ways to prevent episodes of psychosis , known as “ relapses ” that may be neurotoxic , as well as to demand pharmacological treatments that act on more than just the dopaminergic system .
Targeting individuals ’ stress response system may be important since higher levels of stress responsiveness are associated with increased occurrences of psychosis and more difficulty in maintaining independence in the community .
He reminds us of the limits of our current medications , their neurotoxicity , and their origins as a “ purple dye ” before they were used as a medication .
New avenues of treatment , he encourages , must be explored .
I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in schizophrenia .

Packers cornerback Charles Woodson was one of 11 people who escaped a house fire in Bay Harbor , Michigan , on Saturday , WTMJ is reporting .
No one was injured , but the multimillion - dollar home burned to the ground .
According to the report , Woodson and his business partner , Rick Ruiz , were in the home and smelled smoke around 4 a.m .
The Petoskey News - Review reports that there was a gathering at the home for “ a celebration for the family for a large gift and naming of the University of Michigan Women ’s Hospital . ”
Woodson donated $ 2 million to the hospital last year .
The owner of the home that burned down is a member of a family whose foundation donated $ 15 million to the hospital .

The court heard a tape of Shields talking to a 999 operator
A woman who battered a man to death with a glass tumbler and a mug has been jailed for a minimum of 14 years .
Elizabeth Shields , 33 , was convicted of murdering John Cook , 61 , at his home in Barrhead in East Renfrewshire last October .
The High Court heard that she giggled as she told a 999 operator that Mr Cook was dead .
She then rang her mother and told her : " I 've just killed a man . "
Temporary judge John Beckett QC sentenced her to life with a minimum period of 14 years before she is eligible for parole .
He said : " You must have struck your victim many times on his face , neck and right arm .
" You used a glass and a mug to strike him .
You then sliced his arm while he lay defenceless .
" This was an attack of some ferocity and you took the life of a man .
His friends and family are left to deal with their loss . "
999 call
The court heard Shields has 49 previous convictions for offences including breach of the peace and assault .
She launched the attack after Mr Cook , who had befriended her , ordered her out of his house .
As he lay dying , she began cutting one of his wrists with the broken glass .
A jury was played a tape of her speaking to a 999 operator who asked if she wanted the police .
Shields replied : " No you need a morgue . "
The 33 - year - old then laughed and added : " He is pan bread , lying dead . "
Throughout her trial Shields denied murdering Mr Cook .
Defence QC Edgar Prais said that his client had led a sad life and was sexually abused as a child .

A boycott of Israeli goods is now necessary
They were not , as Israel 's defence minister Ehud Barack ludicrously tried to claim , " an armada of hate and violence " .
Nor was the Mavi Marmara " a boat of hate " , as Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the Turkish ship , trying to justify his commandos gunning down nine civilians on board as they stormed the boat in international waters .
But Netanyahu was right on one count .
" This was not a love boat . "
The Free Gaza flotilla has been classed by some as a bunch of well - meaning but misguided hippy activists who want to spread peace and love and do not understand the delicate balances of power within the Middle East region .
The movement is far from that , and legitimately so .
These are well - informed , sincere and highly - motivated people who have come together from across the globe to muster the refreshing force of people power .
They know that , in the absence of any meaningful moves at governmental level to force Israel to dismantle its illegal blockade of Gaza and to pressurise both Palestine and Israel to take part in peace talks , 1.6 million inhabitants of Gaza will continue to live in desperate conditions , their access to food and supplies reliant on the whim of the Israeli authorities .
The flotilla carried a humanitarian cargo , but it was ultimately , and powerfully , political .
The Free Gaza organisation knows full well that action to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 1860 , which calls on Israel to dismantle the blockade of Gaza , will never happen because the blockade is a product of the very foreign policy these countries promote .
It knows that neither the US nor Europe will do anything to pressurise Israel into meaningful talks with Palestinian leaders which , now that the Palestinian Authority has lost all authority in the Gaza strip , must include Hamas in some context .
As a result , the flotilla could not simply offload its cargo at the Israeli port of Ashdod and hand over the aid .
It could never be merely a humanitarian mission .
The boats had to publicly challenge the blockade itself in order to highlight its illegality and its effect on the people of Gaza .
The mistake Israel made was to act against the citizens of 40 different friendly nations , including many high - profile individuals , in the same way as it generally reacts to those who oppose it in Lebanon or Gaza – with lethal force .
The Israelis will absorb the body blows of international anger .
They will try to justify the killings with talk of self defence .
They will continue spinning the fiction that the Israeli commandos who opened fire on the people defending themselves were actually the victims .
They will talk about unproven links to al - Qaeda and will raise the menace of Iranian weapons .
But there is no doubt that last week 's use of overwhelming force has left them unusually isolated .
John Ging , the UN's representative in the besieged Gaza says the Mavi Marmara killings have " exposed the failure of the international community to match its words with deeds " .
The initial response has been promising .
Britain 's condemnation of the killings was unexpectedly trenchant , with the new foreign secretary William Hague calling for an end to the illegal blockade .
The EU , as a whole , was disappointingly more muted , but still condemnatory .
Turkey is now , of course , a foe rather than an ally .
Ireland may be relatively powerless as a small nation , but Micheál Martin has been assiduous in describing conditions in Gaza to his European colleagues since he became the first EU foreign minister to go there .
He is an articulate opponent of injustice and could argue persuasively for the suggestion by aid agency Trócaire that Israel 's privileged trading position within Europe be withdrawn until the blockade is lifted .
The beginnings of a change in unconditional support from the US also seem to be taking root .
The power of a people 's movement lies in its ability to challenge national or international policies that are inherently unjust .
The Rachel Corrie , acting as a second wave of protest , was genuinely feared by the Israelis because of its highly - charged symbolic power .
A boat loaded with humanitarian aid and carrying an Irish nobel laureate , Mairéad Maguire , and the United Nations ' former deputy secretary general Denis Halliday , could not be confronted aggressively by gun-toting commandos .
By all accounts , yesterday 's seizure of the ship as it sailed close to the Gaza shore was a completely different operation to Monday 's massacre .
But Israel cannot prevent wave after wave of similar protests .
The people 's movement has made enforcement of the blockade not just " unsustainable " to use Hillary Clinton 's phrase , but indefensible .
These activists are showing that individuals can make a difference and that when an issue has international popular support , symbols take on a political power of their own .
While everyone cannot join a convoy , there are times when it's not enough to know that citizens of Gaza are suffering at the hands of a country that is supposed to be our friend .
A boycott of Israeli goods by Irish people may seem like gesture politics , but it could achieve two aims .
It would show solidarity with the people of Gaza and it would also register collective displeasure at what the Israelis are doing .
Nelson Mandela told the Dunnes strikers , who made a great personal sacrifice during the struggle against apartheid in South Africa , that their gesture kept him going while in prison .
The activists who took part in the Free Gaza flotilla may be regarded by some as extremists , and by others as do - gooders who should mind their own business .
But most of us who do nothing should remember that it is generally when injustice remains unchallenged that it persists .
Advertising and Marketing A blue - collar beer goes upmarket
The above advertisement appears on the inside front cover of the current issue of Window of the South ( 南风窗 ) , a respected biweekly business magazine .
At first glance it looks like an ad for a wine or a brandy , but closer inspection reveals the actual brand : Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer 1844 .
1844 was the year that the Pabst Brewing Company was established in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
In the US , the beer 's lack of pretension led to a recent upswing in popularity among hipsters .
With 1844 , the brand seems to be targeting a different demographic in the Chinese market .
The ad copy ( on the facing page ) begins with comparisons to the finest of alcohols :
It 's not just Scotch that 's put into wooden casks .
There 's also Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer 1844
Many world - famous spirits
Are matured in precious wooden casks
Scotch whisky , French brandy , Bordeaux wine ...
They all spend long days inside wooden casks
It goes on to describe how the premium wood and craftsmanship of the casks creates the beer 's wondrous color and flavor , and ends by calling Pabst " truly a treasure among beers . "
Does Pabst Blue Ribbon 1844 truly merit such comparisons ?
It 'll cost you around 300 RMB to try a bottle for yourself , according to a Beijing Youth Daily article from last November , when the product was launched .
The article quoted Ni Chunlin , head of Blue Ribbon Beer , which produced Pabst in China : " China 's beer market has an annual sales volume of 40 million tons .
So why is the price of beer always around 5 or 10 yuan ? "
...
Ni Chunlin said that the release of Blue Ribbon 1844 is aimed at changing consumers ' ideas about beer .
" The high - end market is occupied by baijiu and wine .
Chinese people can afford to drink baijiu that costs tens of thousands , and I believe that a 300 - yuan beer wo n't be a problem either . "
Update ( 2010.07.21 ) : Evan Osnos points to an interview with Alan Kornhauser , Pabst Brewmaster - Asia , from the July issue of All About Beer magazine : I still like formulating specialty beers .
In fact , with Pabst , I just made the first specialty beer in Mainland China .
There ’s almost no ale in China : I had to smuggle the yeast into the country .
I formulated a special high - gravity ale called “ 1844 . ”
It ’s all malt , and we use caramel malts from Germany .
The initial aging is dry - hopped rather heavily .
Then we do a secondary aging in new uncharred American oak whiskey barrels .
We bought 750 brand new barrels to the tune of $ 100,000 .
This is a very special beer ; it ’s retailing for about over $ 40 U.S. for a 720 ml bottle .
There ’s an audience there for it ?
There ’s the nouveau riche , and in China , perception is everything — look at me , I ’m rich .
Then also , there is another group that may be part of our market , and that ’s state banquet dinners .
Normally , you ’d drink brandy , and this beer kind of has the look of brandy — it ’s a reddish - brown color , but it wo n’t hurt you as much .

" Currently , every coachman and every waiter is debating whether relativity theory is correct " - said Einstein ; there are striking parallels with climate denial .
“ This world is a strange madhouse .
Currently , every coachman and every waiter is debating whether relativity theory is correct .
Belief in this matter depends on political party affiliation . ” – so wrote Albert Einstein in a letter to his one time collaborator , the mathematician Marcel Grossmann in 1920 .
Jeroen van Dongen of the Institute for History and Foundations of Science at Utrecht University in Holland , writing in a recent edition of the journal ‘ Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics ’ , describes the effectiveness of the movement that grew up to oppose Einstein ’s theory .
There are some striking parallels with today ’s climate debate .
At a time when The Guardian just reported another poll showing a drop in concern about climate change , and a New York Times front page this week described Britons ’ growing doubts about the science , it is worth taking a look at that anti-science campaign , which was waged by Einstein ’s critics because like today ’s climate denial movement , the anti-relativity movement had some success too .
Van Dongen writes :
“ Anti-relativists … built up networks to act against Einstein ’s theory in concert .
This led to some success .
For instance , the clamour about the theory in Germany contributed to the Nobel Committee ’s delay in awarding its 1921 prize to Einstein and to the particular choice of subject for which he finally did receive it : his account of the photo - electric effect , instead of the controversial theory of relativity . ”
He continues :
“ Anti-relativists were convinced that their opinions were being suppressed .
Indeed , many believed that conspiracies were at work that thwarted the promotion of their ideas .
The fact that for them relativity was obviously wrong , yet still so very successful , strengthened the contention that a plot was at play . ”
Van Dongen concludes :
“ Conspiracy theories tend to do well in uncertain times : they create order in chaos …
Just as there is no real point in debating conspiracy theorists , there was no point in explaining relativity to anti-relativists …
“ Their strong opposition was not due to a lack of understanding , but rather the reaction to a perceived threat …
Anti-relativists were convinced of their own ideas , and were really only interested in pushing through their own theories : any explanation of relativity would not likely have changed their minds . ”
Despite the well - intentioned efforts of some climate scientists like Professor Rapley of the Science Museum , it ’s not apparent that a repeated explanation of the basics of climate science is what will help in the face of the latest disinformation campaigns on global warming .
As I ’ve documented elsewhere , prolific climate deniers such as Ian Plimer , James Delingpole and Christopher Booker who deliberately spread untruths on climate change can be wrong 99 % of the time and right for less than 1 % of the time and still ‘ win the argument ’ because the playing field simply is n’t level ; equally , the IPCC can be right 99 % of the time and wrong less than 1 % of the time , and they still ‘ lose . ’
As Dr. Robert J. Brulle of Drexel University , whom the New York Times quoted last year as “ an expert on environmental communications , ” told Climate Progress :
“ It is well known in both sociology and communications that public opinion is largely shaped by media coverage .
So the shift in public opinion about climate change is linked to the nature of mainstream media coverage of the so - called ‘ climategate scandal ’ . ”
It is not a surprise that public concern about climate change should have been dented following such a fierce media and smear campaign by a coalition of fossil fuel industries ( well documented in the case of Koch industries and Exxon ) and conservative ‘ think tanks ’ ( covered extensively by Desmogblog and Climateprogress in a US context , and exposed to a less extent in the UK ) which have peddled disinformation for decades to deny this fact .
As the US blogger David Roberts wrote for Grist in response to separate polls on US public opinion in relation to global warming :
“ Polls about climate science get treated like the results of some contest between two ideological interest groups .
It becomes a horserace story – ‘ Democrats / environmentalists are losing ’ – rather than a story about danger to public health .

3D TV is an exciting proposition for home cinema buffs , yet the technology comes with a hell of a lot of baggage .
It demands our attention and the emptying of our wallets , but TV should n’t be this hard to watch .
It ’s not hard to decipher our love affair with the telly .
It welcomes our unceremonious slump onto the sofa after a hard day , demands only half of our attention , but always has plenty to give back ( if you ’re prepared for a bit of channel surfing ) .
If , on occasion , our telly does show what we want to watch , then we sit up and pay attention , but it ’s still a ‘ take me or leave me ’ proposition .
No strings .
Forget all that with 3D TV
3D TV is an event ; an event with so many strings you ’ll end up tied in knots .
It demands not only your total attention but the attention of everyone else in the room , each wearing a pair of ridiculously priced glasses for good measure ( £ 100 a pop anyone ? )
It ’s like settling down to watch your favourite DVD with the family but having to ensure everyone is appropriately dressed .
No quick crossword , no quick web surf on the iPhone and definitely no sneaking off to the loo .
The 3D telly is on and it ’s in control .
‘ Fair enough ’ , you might say – for a special event like a 3D movie it ’s fine to make that extra special effort .
It ’s worth it in the end right ?
Well in a word , no .
Sure the technology is impressive , and the first time you slip on the specs you ’ll experience the ‘ wow factor ’ .
But it does n’t last long .
The glasses are uncomfortable and heavy , background light flickers in the corner of your eye and the 3D effect is quickly muted if you happen to take your eyes off the screen .
In short , 3D TV is a chore and like most chores it does n’t make you feel good .
3D TV does n’t match the hype
Do n’t get me wrong – I was very excited about 3D TV and love new technologies ( no really , you ’re never more than three steps away from a gadget in the Briggs ’ house ) .
And this is nothing to do with the lack of 3D content ( it ’ll come ) or the high price of the TVs ( they ’ll fall in time ) .
3D TV just does n’t match the hype being generated by the industry .
It feels like a gimmick born from TV industry executives gathering in the boardroom , plonking Avatar ’s receipts on the table and saying , ‘ We want some of this ’ .
Once the dust has settled , tales of clunky glasses and monster 60 - inch screens will get around and 3D TV will be quietly consigned to the canon of expensive technology flops .
Only LG ’s passive display technology ( cheap glasses included ) could save the day .
But then why bother when you can go to the cinema ?
A University of California law school ’s refusal to give official student group status to a Christian society that excluded gays was a reasonable application of the school ’s nondiscrimination policy , the Supreme Court said Monday in a 5 - 4 ruling .
The Christian Legal Society chapter had sued UC Hastings College of the Law , arguing that denial of school recognition and of access to state funding and facilities violated the group ’s 1st and 14th Amendment rights to free speech , expressive association and the free exercise of religion .
The society chapter , formed at the San Francisco law school in 2004 , required members to forswear “ unrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle , ” which it defined as sex outside of heterosexual marriage .
The court ’s opinion , written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , said the law school ’s decision was reasonable in that the state - funded university requires all groups wearing its endorsement to be nondiscriminatory .

“ Hastings , through its [ Registered Student Organization ] program , is dangling the carrot of subsidy , not wielding the stick of prohibition , ” Ginsburg wrote in the opinion , joined by Justices John Paul Stevens , Anthony M. Kennedy , Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor .
The majority noted that the court was ruling only on the constitutionality of the school ’s requirement that groups accept “ all comers , ” not on broader challenges to the nondiscrimination tenets .
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote in dissent that the majority ruling amounted to “ no freedom for expression that offends prevailing standards of political correctness in our country ’s institutions of higher learning . ”
Alito , joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , noted that Hastings has more than 60 registered student groups and that in its entire history has denied registration to “ exactly one : the Christian Legal Society . ”
Alito said the majority gave public educational institutions “ a handy weapon for suppressing the speech of unpopular groups . ”

Hastings Dean Leo Martinez , who was the defendant in the case , cheered the high court ’s decision .
“ The college ’s intent has always been to ensure the leadership , educational and social opportunities afforded by officially recognized student organizations are available to all students attending public institutions , ” Martinez said .
“ The court ’s ruling validates our policy , which is rooted in equity and fairness . ”
The Anti-Defamation League hailed the decision as “ a ringing affirmation that public universities have the right to implement and enforce policies that reject discrimination by school clubs . ”
A lawyer for the Christian group , however , noted that the Supreme Court ruling was focused on the narrow question of Hastings ’ all - comers policy , while at least two broader challenges are still making their way through the courts .

“ The court did not adjudicate whether the application of nondiscrimination policies to a religious student group is constitutional , ” said Gregory S. Baylor , senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund , a Christian legal organization .
Baylor said cases from the University of Montana and San Diego State University had been on hold pending the Hastings decision .

Anybody who thinks wind and other intermittent renewable energy sources are the answer to Ontario ’s power supply problems needs to monitor the electricity system operator ’s website .
Here we are , in a major heat wave , and the provincial wind fleet is operating at a ONE PERCENT CAPACITY FACTOR .
That ’s right : wind , the mainstream greens ’ preferred power source , is contributing one tenth of one percent of the province ’s electricity .
So where is the other 99.99 percent of Ontario ’s power coming from ?
The top four souces , from highest to lowest , are : nuclear ( 9,321 megawatts ) , natural gas ( 5,382 MW ) , coal ( 5,035 MW ) , and hydro ( 3,796 MW ) .
It is those four that are powering the province ’s air conditioners right now .
Good thing we have the nuclear plants .
Together with hydro , they are ensuring that 55 percent of the electricity in Ontario ’s grid comes with zero emissions .
Now , if the mainstream greens had their way , those 9,321 MW of nuclear power would be coming from natural gas plants .
Well , over the past hour , natural gas — a supposedly clean fuel — would have dumped 5,126 extra tons of carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas the mainstream greens pretend to hate , into the very same atmosphere the greens pretend to love .
No policy maker should listen to anything the mainstream greens say .
Next time somebody tells you wind and solar are the answer to Ontario ’s power problems , remember this date / time .

This post is very specific to one type of infection , there are many different types of infections and symptoms , do not be discouraged if the scenario does not fit your situation .
There are more recent posts on what pharma hacks look like in 2016 .
A more detailed guide on how to address a hack in WordPress was released in 2016 .
In the last few weeks , the most common questions we ’re receiving are related to the “ pharma ” ( or blackhat SEO spam ) hack on WordPress sites .
This attack is very interesting because it is not visible to the normal user and the spam ( generally about Viagra , Nexium , Cialis , etc ) only shows up if the user agent is from Google ’s crawler ( googlebot ) .
Also , the infection is a bit tricky to remove and if not done properly will keep reappearing .
Because of this behavior , many sites have been compromised for months with those spam keywords and no one is noticing .
A quick way to check if your site is compromised is by searching on Google for “ inurl : yoursite.com cheap viagra or cheap cialis ” or using our free security scanner .
For example , this is the result of our scanner against wpremix.com ( which was infected at the time we were writing this post ) :
Pharma Hack – Details
The pharma hack has various moving parts :
Backdoor that allows the attackers to insert files and modify the database .
Backdoor inside one ( or more ) plugins to insert the spam .
Backdoor inside the database used by the plugins .
If you fix one of the three , but forget about the rest , you ’ll most likely be reinfected and the spam will continue to be indexed .
As always , we recommend that you update your WordPress instance to the latest version .
This goes for all of your plugins , themes , etc. WordPress is typically very secure , it ’s when you ’re running old versions and out of date plugins / themes that run into trouble .
Keep your stuff up to date to minimize the risk of infection significantly .
1. Backdoor Gives Remote Access to Users
This is the first step in the infection .
Generally , attackers do large scale scans and try to inject the backdoors into compromised sites .
They do this by searching for vulnerable WordPress installations ( older versions ) , vulnerable plugins , hosting companies with known security weaknesses , etc .
When the backdoor is added , it is not immediately executed .
Sometimes it stays for months without ever getting called .
The common places for these backdoors are :
wp-content/uploads /.* php ( random PHP name file ) wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile_old.php.xl wp-includes/wp-db-class.php wp-includes/images/wp-img.php
Characteristically in the past , these files have had an “ eval ( base64_decode ” , ultimately that ’s what most people recommend searching for .
However , on the pharma attack , the backdoor starts with :
< ? php $ XZKsyG='as ';$ RqoaUO='e';$ygDOEJ=$XZKsyG.'s '.
$ RqoaUO .'r '.'t'; $ joEDdb ='b '.$ XZKsyG.$RqoaUO .( 64 ) .'_'.'d '. $ RqoaUO .'c '.'o'.'d '.
$ RqoaUO;@$ygDOEJ(@$j oEDdb('ZXZhbChiYXNlNjRfZGVjb2RlKCJhV1lvYVhOelpY... ( long long string ) ..
So , it still calls eval ( base64 _decode but using variables making it harder to detect .
In fact , none of the WordPress security plugins are able to find it .
Our suggestion is to search for this string : php $ [ a - zA - Z ] * =’as ’ ;
If you do an inspection of the code , you will see that it scans for wp - config . php , gets the database information , acts as a remote shell and retrieves a lot of information about the system .
That ’s the first thing you have to remove before you do anything else .
2. Backdoor Inside One of the Plugins
This is the second part of the attack .
After successfully creating a backdoor into the system , a file will be created inside one of the existing plugins .
Example :
akismet/wp-akismet.php akismet/db-akismet.php wp-pagenavi/db-pagenavi.php wp-pagenavi/class-pagenavi.php
podpress/ext-podpress.php tweetmeme/ext-tweetmeme.php
excerpt-editor/db-editor.php akismet/.akismet.cache.php akismet/.akismet.bak.php tweetmeme/.tweetmem.old.php
Note that they will infect one or more of your enabled plugins and use names like wp - [ plugin ] . php , db - [ plugin ] .php , ext - [ plugin ] .php , or something similar .
We do not recommend you rely only those samples for your search , but try looking for any plugin file with the wp_class_support string on it .
$ grep -r " wp_class_support " ./wp-content / plugins
If you are infected , you will see things like ( full content of the file ) :
./wp-content/plugins/akismet/db-akismet.php:if(!defined('wp_class_support' ) )
{ ./wp-content/plugins/akismet/db-akismet.php : define(' wp_class_support ', true ) ;
Make sure to remove those files .
To be 100 % sure your plugins are clean , I would recommend removing all of them and adding from scratch ( not possible for all sites , but this is probably the most secure way of doing it ) .
3. Backdoor Inside the Database
This is the last step , and equally important .
This is where the spam itself is hidden .
They have been using the wp_options table with these names in the option_name :
wp-options -> class_generic_support wp-options -> widget_generic_support wp-options -> wp_check_hash wp-options -> rss_7988287cd8f4f531c6b94fbdbc4e1caf wp-options -> rss_d77ee8bfba87fa91cd91469a5ba5abea wp-options -> rss_552afe0001e673901a9f2caebdd3141d
Some people have been seeing fwp and ftp_credentials being used as well , so check there too .
These SQL queries should clean your database :
delete from wp_options where option_name = ' class_generic_support ' ; delete from wp_options where option_name = ' widget_generic_support ' ; delete from wp_options where option_name = ' fwp ' ; delete from wp_options where option_name = ' wp_check_hash ' ; delete from wp_options where option_name = ' ftp_credentials ' ; delete from wp_options where option_name = 'rss_7988287cd8f4f531c6b94fbdbc4e1caf ' ; delete from wp_options where option_name = ' rss_d77ee8bfba87fa91cd91469a5 ba5abea ' ; delete from wp_options where option_name = ' rss_552afe0001e673901a9f2caebdd3141d ' ;
Conclusion
Tricky stuff !
The attackers are getting better and we have to learn how to protect our sites and servers .
If you need any help cleaning up the mess or you need a partner to help with your security needs , Sucuri is here to assist .

An increasingly irreconcilable difference of opinion between Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff and his most successful living predecessor , Jean Chrétien , is at the root of the spreading turmoil within the federal Liberal party .
While the two men share a strong belief that a Harper majority victory in the next election would have profound and — from their perspective — tragic consequences for the country , Chrétien is convinced that little short of a pre-election recasting of the progressive side of the federal landscape can ensure that Conservative rule does not become the new normal in Canada .
The former prime minister has come to the view that the future success of the Liberal brand and the maintenance of the central place of its values in the country ’s political life rest with a more co-operative relationship with the NDP .
On that score , a merger is only one of a variety of options at hand and hardly the preferred one .
Alternatives include the softer approach of an electoral coalition or even just a non-aggression pact between the two parties for the next campaign .
Chrétien is supported in his belief by his former constitutional teammate Roy Romanow , but also by former federal NPD leader Ed Broadbent .
Broadbent led the NDP to an unprecedented seat score in 1988 but his success also helped create the conditions for the second Brian Mulroney majority and the passage of the free - trade agreement with the United States .
Chrétien , Romanow and Broadbent see the upcoming battle for the Montreal riding of Outremont between Thomas Mulcair , the NDP ’s only Quebec MP , and Martin Cauchon , a past and potentially future Quebec federal Liberal star , as a sample of the self - defeating war the national progressive parties are poised to wage against each other in the next election .
Chrétien ’s reasoning involves an implicit admission that exceptional conditions presided over his three consecutive majorities , conditions that will not be replicated .
On the occasion of the hanging of his official portrait on Parliament Hill a few weeks ago , he joked that he could still return to lead the party to victory .
Made in jest , that comment involved a good dose of post - politics hubris .
In the 2000 campaign for instance , Chrétien virtually tied the Bloc Québécois for seats in Quebec .
Those Liberal gains went a long way to secure his majority victory .
But the NDP did not even win two per cent of the popular vote in the province in that election .
Under Jack Layton , it polls in the mid-teens .
With party fortunes stagnant , Liberal history — replete as it is with leadership - related back - stabbing — is repeating itself these days .
But there is more at play than the kind of personal rivalry that pitted the Chrétien and Paul Martin clans against each other for the duration of the two men ’s joint tenure in politics .
Ignatieff has fallen on the wrong side of Chrétien on a subject that his predecessor links to the fundamental issue of the future of the country and the place of the party he once led in it .
Up to a point , their differences are reminiscent of those that opposed Pierre Trudeau to John Turner at the time of the Meech Lake constitutional debate .
The active participation of the former prime minister in behind - the - scenes conversations over new arrangements with the NPD as well as his recent vocal public support for the concept speak to a high level of engagement in the debate .
The last time Chrétien and Ignatieff locked horns by proxy was last fall , over the latter ’s refusal to pave the way for Cauchon ’s run in his former riding of Outremont .

Ignatieff blinked and that set in motion the resignation of then - Quebec lieutenant Denis Coderre .
The Quebec wing of the party has yet to recover from that episode and , along with it , the leader ’s standing in a province where the Liberals need to make gains if they are to have a shot at government in the next election .
At the time of that collision , Chrétien signalled that he believed the Liberals should still fight the next campaign under Ignatieff and , presumably , as a stand - alone party .
It should come as no surprise that the message that he has now come to a different conclusion on both scores is resonating loudly within Liberal ranks .

The use of the term " fragmentation " to describe Google 's Android operating system has no merit because people can't agree what the term means , according to an Android developer .
In a June 1 post on the Android developer 's blog , Dan Morrill , open source and compatibility program manager for Google Android , said he remembered first seeing the " F - word " in stories shortly after Android Vice President of Engineering Andy Rubin and Google CEO Eric Schmidt unveiled Android on Nov. 5 , 2007 .
Morrill noted that people who wrote about the supposed fragmentation problem for Android had different definitions for the term .
For example , he noted that some people use it to describe that Google pumps out too many operating systems , while others claim it refers to optional APIs causing inconsistent platform implementations .
Others use it to describe " locked down " devices , or the existence of multiple versions of the software at the same time .
" Because it means everything , it actually means nothing , so the term is useless , " Morrill argued .
" Stories on ' fragmentation ' are dramatic and they drive traffic to pundits ' blogs , but they have little to do with reality .
' Fragmentation ' is a bogeyman , a red herring , a story you tell to frighten junior developers .
Yawn . "
While Morrill 's position accurately reflects that of the company to date , there are signs the company has had trouble keeping Android up to par with its own applications .
Google has had to to adapt applications such as Google Maps Navigation and Google Gesture Search to work on Android 1.6 devices , in addition to the Android 2.0 or later builds they were initially created for .
Google Earth for Android works on Android 2.1 devices and later .
So there are certainly compatibility issues in adapting Google applications for earlier versions of Android , such as 1.5 and 1.6 .
With each new version of Android -- Google is on Android 2.2 , the Froyo build , now -- an older model gets shunted to the back of the line .
Morrill , who said Google defines " Android compatibility " as the ability of a device to properly run apps written with the Android SDK , addressed this issue in his post :
" While it 's true that devices without the latest software can't run some of the latest apps , Android is 100 percent forward - compatible - apps written properly for older versions also run on the newest versions . "
The choice is in app developers ' hands as to whether they want to live on the bleeding edge for the flashiest features , or stay on older versions for the largest possible audience .
And in the long term , as the mobile industry gets more accustomed to the idea of upgradeable phone software , more and more devices will be upgraded .
Morrill 's position makes sense , but it may be of little comfort to owners of the Android 1.6 - based HTC Droid Eris , or the Motorola Cliq and Backflip , which run Android 1.5 .
Owners of those phones have to wait until apps built for Android 2.0 or newer get ported to their smartphones .
And where there are consumers who can't access apps because they 're running an older OS , there 's bound to be allegations of fragmentation .
The Technologizer puts a fine point on the issue in this post .
Google is unbowed by this , even as it is aware of the issues .
Android head Rubin told the San Jose Mercury News :
" Our product cycle is now , basically twice a year , and it will probably end up being once a year when things start settling down , because a platform that 's moving - it 's hard for developers to keep up .
I want developers to basically leverage the innovation .
I do n't want developers to have to predict the innovation . "
The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne uses the BP oil disaster as a teaching moment about the S - word :
[ T ] his is an excellent moment to recognize that our arguments pitting capitalism against socialism and the government against the private sector muddle far more than they clarify [ …]
" Deregulation " is wonderful until we discover what happens when regulations are n't issued or enforced .
Everyone is a capitalist until a private company blunders .
Then everyone starts talking like a socialist , presuming that the government can put things right because they see it as being just as big and powerful as its Tea Party critics claim it is .
But the truth is that we have disempowered government and handed vast responsibilities over to a private sector that will never see protecting the public interest as its primary task .
The sludge in the gulf is , finally , the product of our own contradictions .
An interesting theory .
Meanwhile , here are some interesting facts :
* The 1980s anti-regime movement in Socialist Hungary was animated largely by environmentalist concerns .
* Czechoslovakia , and especially the you - had - to - see - it - to - believe - it environmental hellscape of Northern Bohemia , was one of the most polluted places on earth during Really Existing Socialism .
Since the re-introduction of capitalism , it has become one of the most rapidly improving .
* Kazakhstan is a nightmare .
* Raise your hand if you remember Russia 's colossal 1994 oil spills in the arctic , and how people then judged Moscow 's clean - up efforts .
* Speaking of which , there was a comprehensive study [ PDF ] of the world 's oil spills between 1986 - 1996 published in April 2003 by the Joint UNDP / World Bank Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme .
One of its many unsurprising findings was that in the former Soviet Union ( FSU ) , 60 percent of oil spills were n't even measured for environmental effects .
One - party states , oddly enough , are not very responsive to their citizens ' desire for transparency , let alone environmental health .
Furthermore ,
Even if only the 42 incidents with information about effects on the soil are used , 24 out of the 42 incidents or about 57 percent resulted in significant pollution , compared to 36 out of 122 incidents or 30 percent in Western Europe . [ … ]
The severity of spillage , measured by the amount of oil spilled , is higher in the FSU than in Western Europe .
The reason could be poor contingency planning and delayed responses to spills when they occur ; poor detection procedures ; long distances between emergency shutdown valves ; or the larger average diameter of pipelines in the FSU than in Western Europe . [… ]
[ T ] here are more mechanical failures and operational errors in FSU than in Western Europe .
This could be due to the utilization of poor pipeline materials , poor construction standards , poor supervision , or lack of clarity of responsibilities in the legislative and regulatory framework .
The higher number of spills in the FSU could also indicate that the Russian pipelines examined in this study are older than lines in Western Europe .
* Wait , did the study just dare to suggest that capitalist - country regulations are better than socialist - country regulations ?
Yes , it sure did :
Russian regulatory and monitoring regimes are more fragmented , less accountable , and less able to quickly delegate responsibility to the relevant agencies when spills occur .
To sum up : Capitalism does not = " no regulations and no role for the federal government during an environmental catastrophe . "
Socialism does not = " better environmental stewardship and quicker clean - up efforts . "
The only " muddle " on this question is the stuff between E.J. Dionne 's ears .
A second man is claiming he slept with South Carolina gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley , but her campaign blames " the good old boys " for the allegations .
Who 's right ?
Advertisement
Jim Davenport of the AP reports that lobbyist Larry Marchant , who until yesterday worked for the campaign of Haley rival and current South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer , says he had a one - night stand with Haley in 2008 .
Like blogger Will Folks , who claimed a past relationship with Haley last week , Marchant has n't offered direct proof , saying , " I did n't have any evidence because you can't have any evidence on a one night affair - you do n't have that . "
And as with Folks , Haley 's campaign has been quick to deny the allegations .
Haley herself says of Marchant 's claims , " This is just disgusting politics .
Two or three months ago I was Nikki who ?
and nobody was saying anything and a couple weeks ago we started going double digits up in the polls and now we have had everything thrown at us . "
And her campaign manager Tim Pearson alleges sexism : " As Nikki Haley rises in the polls , the good old boys in Columbia see their taxpayer - funded fraternity party coming crumbling down , and they will say or do anything to hold onto their power . "

It 's not clear if Haley , who 's been endorsed by Sarah Palin and shares her small - government beliefs , is actually a victim of sexists who want to see a woman brought low , of cynical politicians who would seek any form of attack regardless of gender , of her own indiscretions , or all of the above .
Marchant does seem a little shady — while Haley hinted that Folks might be paid by one of her opponents , Marchant actually was — at least until yesterday , when he resigned from Bauer 's campaign due to " inappropriate conduct not in keeping with the goals of this campaign . "
Andre Bauer denies " shopping " Marchant 's story , and Marchant says it 's " crazy " to think he was paid to bring Haley down , but his stated reasons for going public do n't sound terribly convincing .
He says that after Haley claimed to have been completely faithful to her husband , " It just gnawed at me to the point I had to confide in my wife and then we both made a joint decision that I was not going to push the issue but that if I was confronted , I was not going to lie about it . "
But why did n't the one - night stand " gnaw at him " before Haley launched her campaign and started doing well in the polls ?
And was he really " confronted ? "
Marchant says
Bauer asked him to resign when a reporter started asking about the affair , but the AP's Davenport notes that publicly acknowledging Marchant 's " inappropriate conduct " was an " unusual step . "
It 's almost like Bauer 's camp wanted reporters to keep asking .

Both Folks and Marchant have claimed they were goaded by an indefatigable press into making their confessions , but they may have their own reasons for going public that have nothing to do with journalists .
Meanwhile , at least one member of the media retains some focus on the issues .
The Times 's Gail Collins points out that , aside from who slept with whom , the biggest question in South Carolina 's Republican gubernatorial primary appears to be " which Republican dislikes government most . "
She continues ,
During the Tuesday debate , Bauer claimed that illegal immigration was caused by lavish government welfare payments , which caused poor people to refuse to do manual labor .
Haley bragged that she had opposed the federal stimulus program .
The attorney general , Henry McMaster , who is currently suing to try to stop the federal government from bringing health care reform to South Carolina , attributed the failures of the state 's public schools to teachers ' being so busy " filling out federal forms that they can't teach . "

Mike Huckabee may have called Andre Bauer " tea party before there was a tea party , " but really all the candidates appear engaged in a race to the bottom in terms of what their state should do for its people .
And while it 's possible that Haley , as a woman of color , has become the target of the " good old boys , " ideologically she 's right there with them .

Social media site Reddit recently asked its readers to help it out financially , as it was running out of staff and means to keep the site running .
An odd request , given that Reddit is owned by a billion - dollar corporation , Conde Nast , but its owner has a fixed budget for the site — and that budget is simply not enough , Reddit 's admins claimed .
The plea was a huge success , claims Reddit in a blog post today , with about 6,000 Reddit members donating .
However , the effort to " save " Reddit changed its business model in an unexpected and interesting way .
At first , users who donated were only promised a badge on their user accounts .
Now , Reddit writes the " gold " status that donors received will give them additional benefits , which effectively means that Reddit has turned freemium .
From the blog post :
" As soon as possible , we 're going to start giving our gold supporters something more than just a trophy .
Now that the pilot has succeeded so well , we 're going to grow reddit gold into a bona fide subscription service a la Total Fark or Ars Technica .
...
As always , we 're taking suggestions for which cool things we should work on first .
Our aim is to get something out to you by this time next week . "
This goes on to show that a very dedicated community can sometimes shape not only your service — which has been the case with social media sites such as Digg and Reddit alike — but also your business plan .
On the other hand , it also shows that being owned by a huge corporation does not always equal financial freedom .
We look forward to seeing how this new freemium financing model works out for Reddit .
Cesc Fabregas is understood to have told Arsene Wenger he wants to leave Arsenal in order to rejoin Barcelona this summer .
Midfielder to meet Wenger to discuss desire to join Barcelona
Villa talks
Cesc Fabregas is understood to have told Arsene Wenger he wants to leave Arsenal in order to rejoin Barcelona as president Joan Laporta hints at making a bid .
Writing in Spanish newspaper , Guillem Balague has revealed that Fabregas has flown in to London from Barcelona to discuss his future at Emirates Stadium with Wenger .
Fabregas recently revealed that he does want to play for former club Barca one day and is keen for his future to be resolved before representing Spain at the World Cup finals .
It now appears that the midfielder is ready to ask for permission to join the newly - crowned Primera Liga champions next season and a fee is likely to be in the region of £ 30 - 35 million .
Meanwhile , Barcelona president Laporta has suggested it may be the right time to bid for the 23 - year - old following Fabregas ' comments at a promotional event last week .
The Arsenal captain , who was plucked from Barca 's youth ranks in 2003 , had said , ' I think I would like to go to Barcelona , whether or not they want me is another thing ' .
Laporta was surprised by Fabregas ' frankness and reckons it is worth considering a move for the influential midfielder .
" It is remarkable that the player has said that , " he told the club's .
" If the technical secretary [ Txiki Begiristain ] believes we must make an effort , we will do and will talk to Arsenal .
" Laporta also confirmed transfer talks were well underway with Valencia over a deal to bring striker David Villa to Camp Nou .
" We are in the negotiating process and everything is going in the right direction , " Laporta added .
" We hope it is resolved soon .
Everything is on track and hopefully we can reach an agreement . "
IN THE 1970s , Germany 's Rhine River was considered '' the open sewer of Europe ' ' .
Near the Swiss border , schools of salmon or trout could be seen on their backs , poisoned by the pollution .
The sight was shocking to Germans and helped bring about a ' ' collective consciousness ' ' on environmental issues , according to German parliamentarian Barbel Kofler .
'' I believe that is where the environmental movement really started to gather pace .
That intensified after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 , '' Kofler said .
'' But what has happened as a result of those events and others is that Germany started to become more aware of its environmental footprint .
It partly answers your question of why Germany is so far ahead of countries such as Australia in terms of renewable energy and attitudes towards climate change .
'' Australia is seen as a highly polluting country , yet it has so much sun and renewable resources .
My question for you is why does it not do more ? ''
It is a question that baffles many Europeans and one that now lies at the feet of Prime Minister Julia Gillard .
Ms Gillard has said she will unveil Labor 's climate change policy at the National Press Club in Canberra tomorrow .
With Labor having gone into the last election promising a price on carbon , and now delaying that pledge until 2012 at the earliest , the rest of the world will be watching to see how it proposes to reduce emissions .
The government 's unwillingness so far to follow the European Union 's lead and put a price on carbon is also restricting investment in renewable energy in Australia .
While some Australians remain fearful that a carbon price will result in mass job losses and depress the economy , the German experience tells a different story .
Rajiv Gandhi , a former prime minister , once said that only 15 percent of spending on the poor actually reached them  the rest was wasted or siphoned off .
That figure may have changed in the decades since he uttered it , but few Indians doubt that a good chunk of the roughly $ 47 billion budgeted this fiscal year to help impoverished citizens is lost .
India ’s Right to Information law has given the poor a powerful tool to ensure they get their slice of that cake .
The law , passed after more than a decade of agitation by good - government activists , has become embedded in Indian folklore .
In the first three years the law was in effect , two million applications were filed .

Jharkhand is an eastern Indian state where corruption and incompetence are rife , fueled by mineral wealth and the political chaos that has gripped the state since it was carved out of the state of Bihar in 2000 .
Here the rural poor are using the law to solve basic problems .
Their success stories seem like the most minor of triumphs , but they represent major life improvements for India ’s poorest .
In one village near Banta , a clinic that was supposed to be staffed full time by a medical worker trained to diagnose ailments like malaria and diarrhea and provide care to infants and expectant mothers had not been staffed regularly for years .
A local resident filed a request to see worker attendance records .
Soon the medical worker started showing up regularly .
The worker , Sneha Lata , an assistant midwife whose government salary is $ 250 a month , denied that she had been neglecting her post .
She said the information law was a nuisance .
“ Because of this law I have to listen to all these complaints , ” she said .
But with villagers now watching , she dares not miss work .
My ultimate comfort food is a plateful of fried chicken and doughnuts .
Back in January , I raved about Thomas Keller ’s buttermilk fried chicken at Ad Hoc in Yountville .
Those were the best fried chicken I have had so far .
The skin is crispy , the meat is moist , the chicken is perfectly fried with an incredible aromatic lemon flavor .
The chicken is brined overnight before it is coated in buttermilk and spices and then deep fried .
I was so in love with Ad Hoc and their fried chicken that I picked up a copy of Ad Hoc at Home , recreated it at home and the results were phenomenal .
Last weekend , we drove back to Yountville to indulge , not in fried chicken this time , but in brioche doughnuts from Thomas Keller ’s Bouchon Bakery .
I had heard about these doughnuts and had been planning a trek to Napa Valley to try them but these treats are truly elusive .
Bouchon only makes them in tiny batches on Saturday and Sunday mornings .
The brioche doughnuts , a creation by pastry chef Richard Capizzi , are so popular that they are typically gone within a few hours after the bakery opens at 7 in the morning .
Last Saturday , I thought Jun-Blog ’s first year anniversary was reason enough to finally try them .
We woke up bright and early at 6 , walked Stanford and fed him breakfast , showered and hit the road at 7 to make sure we got a taste of those decadent doughnuts .
The bakery is pretty and quaint with a huge , brightly lit display full of macarons , muffins , eclairs , tarts , and bouchons — small chocolate brownie - like treats shaped like a cork .
But I had my eyes on only one thing and after I spotted them neatly arranged on a cake pedestal next to the croissants and baguettes , I got extremely excited .
It was 8:30 in the morning , there was only a couple of people in line ahead of me and I simply could n’t wait .
Sometimes , I wonder how I do it .
I wonder how I can keep myself from grabbing the doughnut or the bread pudding I am photographing .
I usually do .
But after spending a good half an hour trying out different shots I threw my lens aside and decided it was time to kick back and enjoy the doughnuts .
The seasonal fruit doughnut was strawberry rhubarb , which is topped with cheesecake frosting and shortbread crumbs .
Bouchon ’s were n’t the typical light and fluffy doughnuts .
They were brioche - like .
Denser and richer .
More buttery .
The strawberry rhubarb filling was pleasantly not overly sweet , not overly tart .
But it was Bouchon ’s chocolate brioche doughnuts that made me fall in love with Thomas Keller even more .
They are filled with rich chocolate ganache , glazed with dark chocolate on top and generously covered with tiny dark chocolate covered rice puffs .
The decadent chocolate ganache filling simply blew me away .
And the wonderful crunch of those tiny spherical chocolate rice puffs totally knocked my socks off .
Those were the best doughnuts I have had so far .
And of course , Stanford had his share of Bouchon bliss as well .
We figured , he was wondering why it was Saturday and we totally abandoned him early in the morning and so we brought home a couple of foie gras biscuits for the corgi .
Foie gras , bacon , ketchup and cornmeal .
No wonder , Stanford inhaled them in two seconds .

BP , already bedeviled by an out - of - control well spewing millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , now finds itself with one more problem : Tony Hayward , its gaffe - prone chief executive .
Among his memorable lines :
The spill is not going to cause big problems because the gulf “ is a very big ocean ” and “ the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to have been very , very modest . ”
And this week , he apologized to the families of 11 men who died on the rig for having said , “ You know , I ’d like my life back . ”
But rather than receiving a limited public role , Mr. Hayward , a geologist who has led the company for three years , has become even more the public face of the company .
On Thursday , BP began showing a new television ad in which Mr. Hayward , speaking directly into a camera , pledges to spare no effort to clean up the spill .
It ends with a heartfelt promise : “ We will get it done .
We will make this right . ”
( The same day , in an interview published in The Financial Times , he said , “ What is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your tool kit . ” )
Due to the amount of information crammed into day 1 of the Google I/ O conference , I am blitzing through everything that happened , keeping it short and to the point .
Due to the amount of information crammed into day 1 of the Google I/ O conference , I am blitzing through everything that happened , keeping it short and to the point .
Right next to the Chevy Volt , which , by the way , is quite a looker , I saw a couple of guys playing with odd flying machines , called AR Drones .
After spending a few minutes talking to them , we got a nice lengthy demo , and let me tell you , this flying monster is beyond cool .
AR Drone is a flying RC type UFO looking thing
here is the kicker : it is controlled by your Android phone ( here they used a Nexus One )
you touch the screen and tilt the phone , which controls the direction of where your AR Drone flies
it uses Adhoc WiFi , which does n't require a router and can be used freely in an open field
check this out : the AR Drone has dual video cameras which transmit the live feed to the Android phone that is controlling it
the covers are interchangeable , so you can have different looking drones
the price is unknown and will be " a couple hundred bucks "
Check out the pics and the videos I took below :
The last shot , which I took after I had already left the demo , is quite hilarious - the constant buzzing above my head made me come back to the AR Drone table and witness the drone glued to the ceiling , trying desperately to fly away , without any desire to come down .
I hope these guys do n't start making real airplanes any time soon .
Check out these videos showing AR Drone in action .
Sorry for the non-HD quality - I 'm planning on buying an HD camera soon ( or see if the EVO 4G quality is good enough ) .
( CNN ) -- Greg Kalkwarf was a teenager when his grandfather told him and his brother , with increasing anger and frustration , " Dean , get out there and milk the cows ! "
There were indeed cows at his grandparents ' farm , but Dean -- Kalkwarf 's uncle -- was n't there , and the grandchildren were n't supposed to be milking them .
" The confusion or the memory loss of Alzheimer 's -- now as I look back , it 's like , that 's what was going on , " said Kalkwarf , 39 , a marketing representative in Denver , Colorado .
His grandfather died from Alzheimer 's complications , and now his mother has it at 65 .
" It 's saddening and disheartening to watch someone you love disappear like that , " he said .
Kalkwarf is one of many children of the 5.3 million people living with Alzheimer 's in the United States who face the terrifying possibility of inheriting a predisposition to the disease .
Now that there are tests in the works for early detection of brain injury due to Alzheimer 's , as well as other biological markers of the disease , the question becomes :
Would you want to know ?
Experts proposed new criteria for diagnosing Alzheimer 's this week at the Alzheimer 's Association International Conference on Alzheimer 's Disease 2010 .
The experts suggest using biomarkers of the disease -- plaques in the brain and specific proteins -- to diagnose Alzheimer's .
These biomarkers can be found with MRI scans , PET imaging and tests of cerebrospinal fluid .
Specific results would better reflect the various stages of the disease , the scientists say .
The guidelines in place currently have not been changed since 1984 -- before that , only an autopsy could say with certainty whether a person had Alzheimer 's disease .
Kalkwarf and several other individuals with a family history of Alzheimer 's said they would definitely want to know if their brains already have signs of the disease .
" Would n't you want to know that -- if you do only have X number of years left -- that , shoot , maybe I should not go to that luncheon and instead go spend time with my family ? " he said .
Lisa Greenberg of Scarsdale , New York , said she would have a brain scan , but not a memory or other cognitive test .
She remembers too well when her mother , who has Alzheimer 's at age 76 , got tested .
At 46 , Greenberg already feels like she 's speaking less eloquently , forgetting things she 's learned and experiencing an inability to learn new technologies .
" I think I do n't want to see what those numbers would be , " she said of the neuropsychological tests .
" I 'm afraid of what they 're going to find . "
There also are those who simply do n't want to know until there 's something they could do about it .
Julie Sue Auslander of Montvale , New Jersey , said in an e-mail that she knows her risk is high through maternal relatives , including her mother and grandmother , but unless there 's a significant way to mitigate the risk , she 'd rather " continue living my life as fully as I do , knowing full well that the beast [ might ] outrun me . "
Although there are no proven interventions for people without Alzheimer 's symptoms , but who may be at risk , neurologists said it is crucial to identify people with early signs of the disease for the purposes of research , so that treatments can be developed when the disease is less severe in the brain .
The drugs currently available are approved for use only in people in late stages and do not slow or cure the progression of the disease .
Dr. James Lah , assistant professor of neurology at Emory University School of Medicine , likens this to late - stage cancer .
" We 're basically treating widely metastatic Alzheimer 's disease , if you will , in the brain rather than attacking it at an early point at a point when it 's very localized , or early , " he said .
People like Auslander , Greenberg and Kalkwarf , who have family histories , are n't certain to get Alzheimer's .
But there is a genetic mutation that nearly always predicts early onset Alzheimer 's , a rare version of the disease that develops in people ages 30 to 60 , according to the National Institute on Aging .
The detection of Alzheimer 's disease in people with no symptoms is very much a work in progress , said Dr. Allan Levey , professor and chair of neurology at Emory University Medical School .
It is currently possible to see brain activity patterns in middle - aged individuals indicative of Alzheimer 's disease , but that information does n't always predict Alzheimer 's , he said .
In the same way that you should n't wait until you have a heart attack to engage in lifestyle and medication interventions , Alzheimer 's should be diagnosed much earlier , so that precautions can be taken , said Maria Carrillo , senior director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer 's Association .
The criteria put forth at the conference are research criteria , not for clinical practice yet .
The idea is that these guidelines for diagnosis will help in the development of drugs and other treatments for the disease , she said .
The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer 's Association are soliciting opinions about the criteria online and hope that there 's enough input to publish them in early 2011 , Carrillo said .
Then they would need to be validated in clinical trials before being used in general practice .
Kalkwarf 's wife , a nurse , makes sure he gets plenty of fish oil and eats other foods enhanced with omega - 3 fatty acids , which have been suggested to improve cognition .
He is already wondering if their 9 - month - old son will one day face issues from Alzheimer's .
In the meantime , Kalkwarf 's mother is participating in an Alzheimer 's study .
" If people are willing to help now , then it 's like everybody else who 's willing to donate their body to science -- that if we all can give up a little bit , hopefully it helps the next generation , " he said .
Ever since Ron Paul announced that he was seeking the nomination of the Republican Party for president , I have heard some assorted libertarians complain about his stance on abortion .
This includes both libertarians who support Dr. Paul and libertarians who oppose him .
Although the arguments of both groups differ , they basically end up saying either :
I support Ron Paul even though he is wrong on abortion .
I do n’t support Ron Paul because he is wrong on abortion .
True , there are usually some other issues included as well ( like immigration ) , but Dr. Paul ’s opposition to abortion seems particularly to inflame some libertarians — even to the point of stating or implying that he is not a libertarian or that opposition to abortion is anti-libertarian .
The question then is a simple one : Is Ron Paul wrong on abortion ?
We know that Dr. Paul is a physician who has delivered over 4,000 babies , but that in and of itself does n’t mean that he is opposed to abortion .
So , what exactly does Ron Paul think about abortion ?
Here are some of his published statements :
The right of an innocent , unborn child to life is at the heart of the American ideals of liberty .
My professional and legislative record demonstrates my strong commitment to this pro-life principle .
In 40 years of medical practice , I never once considered performing an abortion , nor did I ever find abortion necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman .
In Congress , I have authored legislation that seeks to define life as beginning at conception , H.R. 1094 .
I am also the prime sponsor of H.R. 300 , which would negate the effect of Roe v Wade by removing the ability of federal courts to interfere with state legislation to protect life .
This is a practical , direct approach to ending federal court tyranny which threatens our constitutional republic and has caused the deaths of 45 million of the unborn .
I have also authored H.R. 1095 , which prevents federal funds to be used for so - called “ population control . ”
Many talk about being pro-life .
I have taken and will continue to advocate direct action to restore protection for the unborn .
Abortion on demand is no doubt the most serious sociopolitical problem of our age .
The lack of respect for life that permits abortion significantly contributes to our violent culture and our careless attitude toward liberty .
As an obstetrician , I know that partial birth abortion is never a necessary medical procedure .
It is a gruesome , uncivilized solution to a social problem .
As an obstetrician - gynecologist , I can assure my colleagues that the partial - birth abortion procedure is the most egregious legally permitted act known to man .
Decaying social and moral attitudes decades ago set the stage for the accommodated Roe vs .
Wade ruling that nationalizes all laws dealing with abortion .
The fallacious privacy argument the Supreme Court used must some day be exposed for the fraud that it is .
Reaffirming the importance of the sanctity of life is crucial for the continuation of a civilized society .
There is already strong evidence that we are indeed on the slippery slope toward euthanasia and human experimentation .
Although the real problem lies within the hearts and minds of the people , the legal problems of protecting life stems from the ill - advised Roe v.
Wade ruling , a ruling that constitutionally should never have occurred .
I believe beyond a doubt that a fetus is a human life deserving of legal protection , and that the right to life is the foundation of any moral society .
Why would a libertarian have a problem with these statements ?
Why should it be considered libertarian to kill a baby in the womb or unlibertarian to oppose such killing ?
And even worse , why would a libertarian say that it was unlibertarian to advocate killing foreigners in an aggressive war but not non-libertarian to kill a baby in the womb ?
There are two kinds of “ pro-choice ” libertarians .
The first recognizes that abortion is not a settled issue in the libertarian community and therefore hesitates to castigate fellow libertarians who oppose abortion as anti-libertarian or unlibertarian .
They are civil , amiable , and likable — like Walter Block .
The newest Libertarian Party platform takes a neutral view of abortion : Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good - faith views on both sides , we believe that government should be kept out of the matter , leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration .
We oppose government actions that either compel or prohibit abortion , sterilization or any other form of birth control .
The second , and more vocal , group of these libertarians is made up of those who are adamant in their belief that opposition to abortion is anti-libertarian or unlibertarian .
When a radical , pro-abortion feminist makes a statement like “ fetuses are parasites who derive all their nutrients from the bodies of their hosts , and quite often pose to their hosts serious health complications and risks .
Any woman carrying a fetus is being generous , ” it does n’t surprise me in the least .
But some “ pro-choice ” libertarians make statements that are just as outrageous .
Abortion is legitimate not because a women ’s body is her own and a fetus is not really a human being anyway , but because a woman ’s body is her own and abortion of an unwanted fetus falls under her legitimate right to defend her person from unwanted violations of her body .
From the beginning , the right of abortion should have been rooted in the liberal rights of the individual and the equality of the right to self - defense .
Those who support abortion should advance the principle that abortion is a component of a women ’s sovereign right of self - defense of her life against unwanted violations of her body , just as every man has the sovereign right to defend his life against aggression from muggers , thieves or politicians , by using whatever amount of coercive force is necessary to repulse the attack on his life or property .
Forcing pregnant women to carry to term is akin to slavery , and in the same way I would not tolerate a state that permitted slavery , I am unwilling to tolerate the banning of abortion at the state level .
There are several reasons why many Christians have an aversion to libertarianism .
I wo n’t get into those here , except to say that being a militant supporter of abortion on demand is certainly one of them .
The non-aggression axiom is central to libertarianism .
The essence of libertarianism is that it is wrong to threaten or initiate violence against a person or his property .
Force is justified only in self - defense .
“ Libertarianism , ” as explained by Murray Rothbard , the twentieth century ’s greatest proponent of it , is not and does not pretend to be a complete moral , or aesthetic theory ; it is only a political theory , that is , the important subset of moral theory that deals with the proper role of violence in social life .
Political theory deals with what is proper or improper for government to do , and government is distinguished from every other group in society as being the institution of organized violence .
Libertarianism holds that the only proper role of violence is to defend person and property against violence , that any use of violence that goes beyond such just defense is itself aggressive , unjust , and criminal .
Libertarianism , therefore , is a theory which states that everyone should be free of violent invasion , should he free to do as he sees fit except invade the person or property of another .
What a person does with his or her life is vital and important , but is simply irrelevant to libertarianism .
Killing someone is the ultimate form of aggression .
Especially a helpless , defenseless fetus that is only guilty of suddenly waking up in a womb .
The fetus certainly had no control over being a parasite , aggressing against a woman , invading a woman ’s body , or adding unwanted pounds to his host — but its mother certainly did .
If an unborn child is not entitled to protection of life , then to be consistent , libertarians should have no problem with the abortion of a fetus from one month old to nine months old .
The nine - month old fetus is no more viable than the one - month old one .
In fact , a one - month old baby has the same degree of viability .
I hate to be so crude , but leave all three of them unattended on a table in a hospital and see what happens .
So again I ask :
Why should it be considered libertarian to kill a baby in the womb or unlibertarian to oppose such killing ?
This has nothing to do with giving the government greater control over a woman ’s body ; it has everything to do with preventing aggression and protecting innocent life .
This being said , the solution is not a federal law or a constitutional amendment banning abortion .
The federal government should not have anything to do with abortion for the simple reason that it should not have anything to do with the majority of what it is currently involved in , and especially crime fighting .
That is part of the police power of the states .
As I have previously written about Ron Paul ’s position on abortion : Ron Paul believes that Roe v.
Wade was wrongly decided because abortion is simply not a constitutional issue .
He does n’t think there is any serious argument based on the text of the Constitution that there exists a federal “ right to abortion . ”
He maintains that the federalization of abortion law is not based on constitutional principles , but on a social and political construct created out of thin air by the Supreme Court .
Since the federal government has no authority to involve itself in the abortion issue , a federal law banning abortion in the states would be just as wrong as Roe v. Wade .
So even if a libertarian thinks Ron Paul is on the wrong side of the abortion question , because he , unlike most pro-lifers who look to politicians and federal judges for their salvation , wants to remove the federal government from the abortion debate , there is no reason to not support him because he opposes abortion .
Although I strongly disagree with him on the subject of abortion , a recent writer on this site made what I thought was a profound statement about Ron Paul and abortion : “ Perhaps Dr. Paul would like to see most , maybe all abortions outlawed .
Maybe he has good reason for feeling that way .
But so what ?
The President of the United States cannot unilaterally declare abortion illegal .
Who would want to live in a country where he could ? ”
He also recognized the non-calamity that would result should a President Paul appoint additional pro-life justices to the Supreme Court : The Supreme Court cannot simply outlaw abortion nationwide .
Instead , the Court could simply rule that it has no jurisdiction over state abortion laws , and send the matter back to state legislatures .
Why would that be so terrible ?
It is unlikely that most states would enact a complete ban on abortions .
In 2006 , a comprehensive ban was put to the voters in South Dakota by means of referendum .
The referendum failed in what is one of the most conservative states in the Union .
If Roe v.
Wade were overturned and abortion laws were once again made the provision of the states , there would be nothing unlibertarian about supporting state laws making abortion a crime just as laws against murder , manslaughter , and wrongful death are considered legitimate actions of the states .
I believe that the antagonism toward Dr. Paul among some libertarians is deeper than the abortion question .
There is a larger issue lurking here .
Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy .
These DC / PC libertarians have some strange ideas :
The more you emphasize alternative lifestyles the more libertarian you are .
The more you support pornography the more libertarian you are .
The more drugs you take the more libertarian you are .
The more religion you reject the more libertarian you are .
These “ lifestyle ” or “ cosmopolitan ” libertarians , some of whom — to the detriment of their cause — are condescending , pompous snobs , are not content with personally and culturally conservative libertarians ( like Ron Paul ) tolerating diversity ; they want them to likewise celebrate depravity .
They apparently do n’t know the difference between libertarianism and libertinism .
And what makes this even worse is that some of them are also liberventionists — justifying the sending of U.S. troops into other countries to bomb , maim , and kill for the very state they decry .
Is Ron Paul wrong on abortion ?
Not in the least .

Interpal : Planned to sue for libel
In an out - of - court settlement , the Board of Deputies of British Jews said it should not have described Interpal in these terms .
London - based Interpal , which raises millions for Palestinian causes , had launched a libel action against the Board , due in the High Court next year .
The board has now published a retraction and apology on its website .
In the statement , the Board said it had reached a settlement with Interpal in relation to a September 2003 article on its website which referred to " terrorist organisations such as Hamas and Interpal " .
" We would like to make it clear that we should not have described Interpal in this way and we regret the upset and distress our item caused , " said the statement .
Interpal is one of the largest Muslim - led charities in Europe and says its funds humanitarian , educational and medical projects in the Palestinian territories .
The charity , which spends approximately £ 5 m a year , insists it keeps exhaustive records and audit trails of how its Palestinian partners spend money .
Claims from Washington
The row with the Board of Deputies began after the US Treasury Department accused Interpal of being part of the European " funding network " for Hamas , the largest militant Islamist organisation in the Palestinian territories involved in suicide bombings .
We are extremely pleased to have won such an important and long - running battle - all that we ever wanted was an apology to clear the charity 's name
Ibrahim Hewitt , Interpal
Officials claimed Interpal was a conduit through which other organisations could fund Hamas ' activities .
Washington said it would freeze any assets of the charity in the US and banned US nationals from having any dealings with the organisation .
The Charity Commission , the UK watchdog , froze the charity 's accounts and launched an investigation .
It later cleared Interpal , saying Washington had not been able to substantiate the claim .
The US Treasury has however kept Interpal on its list of suspected organisations , a situation that continues to infuriate many British Muslims .
Ibrahim Hewitt , chairman of Interpal , told the BBC that he welcomed the Board of Deputies ' apology .
The precise terms of the settlement would remain confidential , he said .
" We are extremely pleased to have won such an important and long - running battle , " said Mr Hewitt .
" All that we ever wanted was an apology to clear the charity 's name .
" We are glad that we can now put the Board of Deputies ' attack upon the charity behind us and can focus our energies entirely upon Interpal 's essential relief work . "
Mr Hewitt said Interpal was still trying to meet with US Treasury officials in an effort to have the charity 's name taken off the list of suspected organisations .
" We have been trying to negotiate with them - we 've always said they are welcome to come and check our systems . "
A spokesman for the Board of Deputies told the BBC there would be no further comment on the issue .
