Yet , in a blurb on its website , the company states its tours place an emphasis on " the unique scenery , wildlife and Aboriginal culture of each area " .
" Do n't blame us if you finish your tour and start telling strangers about all the weird and wonderful facts you 've learnt about rocks , plants , animals , aboriginal [ sic ] culture , all the great people you 've met and how wonderful it is to be alive ! " the website states .
The Aborigines , mostly women , had travelled to Alice Springs to take life - saving classes in preparation for the opening of a swimming pool in their community of Yuendumu , located about 300 kilometres north - west of Alice Springs .
They were allegedly asked to leave the Haven Hostel after checking in , because of complaints by other guests .
" They said that it was because of the colour of our skin and they did n't like us , " group member Bethany Langdon said of the hostel management .
The Royal Life Saving Society of Australia said the ejection was " purely racist " in intention .
" It was a very feeble excuse about a complaint having been made but , looking into that , there was no complaint , there was no reason , it was just pure racism , " the society 's chief executive , Rob Bradley told ABC Television last night .
In ownership documents the hostel is listed as the property of Ken Hart and Greg Zammit , who also own Adventure Tours Australia , formerly called Northern Territory Adventure Tours .
Adventure Tours Australia , established in 1993 , has won numerous tourism awards , including the Northern Territory 's tourism awards , the Brolgas .
Another member of the life - saving class , Sharelle Young , said : " They should apologise to us face - to - face and just say sorry . "
Ms Langdon and other members of her remote community are reportedly considering legal action against the Alice Springs hostel 's management following their ejection .
" When we booked in , the manager , she gave us the keys to the rooms and we went and put our stuff in the rooms .
" We all went outside and the manager came out and told me that we were n't suitable to stay there , '' Ms Langdon told ABC Radio today .
" They said [ it was ] because we were Aboriginal .
Other customers were making complaints that they were scared of us .
" I felt like I wanted to cry because it made me feel like I was n't an Australian , like I was n't wanted there . "
Mr Bradley said the incident soured the occasion for the Yuendumu community .
" We have worked over a long period of time to build the partnerships , to build the trust with 11 indigenous communities around the NT , " he told ABC Radio .
" This is a big stumbling block .
I hope it does n't put people off . "
The territory 's anti-discrimination commissioner , Tony Fitzgerald , said the women could have a strong case .
" If the story is true , it 's disgraceful but it is not the only story exactly like this that we have heard anecdotally at the commission , " he said .
" The challenge for us is to convince people who do suffer this sort of unfair treatment to make a complaint so that we can investigate it and follow it through . "
The Haven Hostel released a statement saying : " Haven Hostel is a backpackers ' hostel catering for international backpacking tourists , which the group was not .
" So [ alternative ] accommodation was sought and arranged with their consultation , on their behalf .
We also offered to pay for that night 's accommodation . "
The group found another place to stay in Alice Springs to complete the training , the report said .

Odyssey in the Arctic with the Russian Icebreaker Fleet
The nuclear - powered icebreakers were considered the symbol of Soviet technological power for many decades .
Today this fleet is still used to aid ship navigation in the seas north of Siberia - but also for the purpose of elite tourism , which surely helps to pay the bills .
The most powerful of all icebreakers - " 50 years of Victory " ( one of six " Arktika " class ) - has two nuclear reactors and is capable of reaching North Pole in just a couple of days .
" Vaigach " and " Taimyr "
Svetlana Bogdanova has recently returned from a very special trip on board the icebreaker " Vaigach " and provided us with these unique photographs .
Thanks to her exclusive permission ( including collection of photos from the seamen of the Murmansk Sea Shipping Company ) we can now offer you a glimpse of what it really means to follow along the caravan of ships in the Northern seas , led by a colossal nuclear - powered vessel .
( top : nuclear icebreaker " Yamal " , via )
Svetlana says : " A nuclear icebreaker almost feels alive , like a huge proud creature with a benevolent and dependable character .
See it moving in the dark of night , projecting a powerful light ahead , making the snow sparkle in a misty path , feel it tremble under your feet ...
Its sheer immensity is inspiring , making one think of heroic exploration of unknown lands , the stuff that kids should be dreaming about " .
" Vaigach " in the mist :
The blizzard is getting worse :
Unexpected Rescue :
This truck got in trouble on treacherous ice , so a professional team quickly comes up with a plan :
The journey resumes :
Breaking the way for a caravan of ships :
" 30 Days of Night " ...
Arriving into Dixon : a small town of about a thousand people -
Its population lives in the Arctic wasteland , enduring the most extreme climate .
A significant part of Dixon has become a ghost town during Soviet years - and a series of ghastly buildings line up to haunt the endless night :
It 's easy to start imagining vampires ... but these buildings are long abandoned .
Though one has to wonder about this cannon - looking thing left nearby :
Back to the Arctic trail
Serene and wonderfully wide - format views along the way - the Svalbard archipelago :

" Lenin " was the first Russian nuclear icebreaker , built in 1957 .
It looked imposing , but suffered two nuclear accidents while in operation till 1989 , and now is being converted into a museum ship .
Another milestone : " Arktika " became the first surface ship ever to reach the North Pole in 1977 .
" 50 Years of Victory " - is the largest , most powerful icebreaker ever constructed .

This lid covers a nuclear reactor :
Nuclear reactor room :
117 meters in length , the " 50 Years of Victory " has TWO nuclear reactors , develops around 500,000 horse power , and its huge steel ice belt 5 meters wide can easily break through ice up to 2.5 meters ( 9.2 feet ) thick .
( The " victory " in its name is the Russian people 's victory over the Nazis in 1945 )
And by the way , in case you 're thinking that no ice can ever stop such behemoths , let me remind you that the nuclear icebreaker " Soviet Union " was trapped in ice for three days in 1998 ( which is nothing compared to Mother Russia trapped in communism for 70 years )
Here is that " Soviet Union " ship -
The rest of 10 nuclear icebreakers are described in detail here .
Bears just wanna have ... milk
Polar bears lead pretty eventful life : from " romantic " courtships to intense family squabbles :
However , if they spot a passing ship , they will drop everything and try to get closer , knowing exactly what they want .
> They will surely start begging for their most favorite treat - condensed sweetened milk in cans : ( not healthy of course , but simply irresistible )
They try to stretch their meal : one can will keep a bear occupied for up to 3 hours .
After they lick the can clean , they start to chew on it , like some sort of chewing gum - to get that last whiff of flavor .
Finally , to sleep with a full tummy :
Polar bear tracks :
Note : if price is no object , Quark Expeditions will offer you exclusive trips to the North Pole on board of these icebreakers .

The Republican Party , in its search for consistency , has now nominated a confessed war criminal to be its presidential nominee .
Having a war criminal for president for the past eight years , at least now the republicans have a candidate who admits it .
While John McCain states that he signed a confession admitting to being a war criminal after being tortured repeatedly , this was most likely the only time in his military / political career he embraced the truth .
Still , there are many in the Prisoner of War / Missing in Action community , including former POWs , who have their doubts about McCain ever being tortured while a Prisoner of War , and actually believe he received preferential treatment at the hands of the North Vietnamese , Russians and Cubans .
Perhaps the reason both McCain and Bush support torture as a means of obtaining military intelligence is they know that is the only way anyone could ever get them to be truthful !
In 1987 — 88 , I spent a multitude of hours volunteering with the American Foundation For Accountability of POWs / MIAs in Arlington , Virginia .
My duties in the foundation included traveling to colleges and high schools throughout the US in an effort to bring public awareness to the plight of military service personnel who had been left in the hands of our enemies in WWII , Korea and Vietnam by the irresponsible government who sent them in harm ’s way .
I distinctly remember when members of the foundation , myself included , made a trip to “ The Hill ” to speak with members of the US House of Representatives and the US Senate to solicit their help in getting legislation passed that would bring pressure on those we believed still held American Servicemen as prisoners and to pass legislation that would protect future service personnel should they be captured .
When we visited the office of Senator McCain , we were told by his staff that he did not have time to visit with us and that “ he believed he could not have survived that long in captivity and therefore he doubted anyone else could have . ”
Just a couple of days later , while working at our vigil near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial , I witnessed Senator McCain alight from his Mercedes Benz sports car with a couple of young , beautiful women , one on each arm , whom he escorted on a tour of the Lincoln Memorial , Vietnam Veterans Memorial area .
It was more than obvious from his actions ; he had a great deal of time for these ladies .
My duties with the foundation brought me in contact with many former Prisoners of War ; it was fantastic to visit and listen to the late Colonel Laird Guttersen , Captain Eugene “ Red ” McDaniel , Major John Parcels , and Larry Stark , not to mention the hundreds of family members of those still missing in either Laos or Vietnam .
I also enjoyed my conversations and time with former Senator Bob Smith and former Congressmen Billy Hendon and Bob Dornan .
Never in any of my conversations with these folks did I ever hear a positive word said about John McCain .
In fact , Colonel Laird Guttersen spoke often of his utter contempt for McCain and his conduct while a prisoner of war .
In the late 1980 ’s and the early to mid 1990 ’s , John McCain would lead the battle to keep the fate of those left behind in the hands of their captors secret from their families and the American public , and was known for his angry verbal attacks on both family members and veterans .
Many find it ironic that the North Vietnamese erected a monument which features prominently a bust of John McCain at the sight of his shoot down .
This is tantamount to the citizens of New York erecting a monument with the bust of Mohammad Atta , or the citizens of Hawaii erecting a monument with the bust of Japanese Fleet Commander Nagumo !
Why has John McCain fought so hard to keep the facts of his imprisonment secret ?
How can anyone defend the character of John McCain , much less support him for president ?
His character began to show its dark side as a Cadet at the U.S. Naval Academy where he was known as a womanizer and underachiever .
He , at his own admission , received preferential treatment at the hands of the North Vietnamese , while true heroes such as US Air Force Academy graduate Captain Lance Sijan endured torture to the death rather than betray their fellow soldiers .
John McCain is no hero ; many veterans refer to him as the Manchurian Candidate .
Was it the Diebold voting machines that brought him the nomination , a nation of cowards , or both ?
In the case of John McCain , it is true we get the government we deserve !

Chronological look at the fiasco in Iraq , especially decisions made in the spring of 2003 - and the backgrounds of those making decisions - immediately following the overthrow of Saddam : no occupation plan , an inadequate team to run the country , insufficient troops to keep order , and three edicts from the White House announced by Bremmer when he took over : no provisional Iraqi government , de-Ba'athification , and disbanding the Iraqi armed services .
The film has chapters ( from History to Consequences ) , and the talking heads are reporters , academics , soldiers , military brass , and former Bush - administration officials , including several who were in Baghdad in 2003 .
Written by < jhailey@hotmail.com >
’d like to be the harbinger of good news , and there is some , but all - in - all , 2007 was a disaster for Democrats and the country at large - Bush and Cheney are still at the helm of power and Congress remains cowed and ineffective .
There have been instances of courage , and you have to admire Chris Dodd for sticking to his guns and coming off the campaign trail to effectively forestall granting the telecoms , and Bush by means of proxy , immunity for illegally helping the government to wiretap innocent Americans and help the Bush administration spy on America .
Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul , each in different ways , have rocked the conventional political wisdom in our country , and instead of being “ politically correct ” , each in his own style have been honest with the country and stood - up for our constitutional values and the rule of law - proving the population is desperate for the truth , and the Mainstream News Media has been exposed to be cowardly and complicit with the Bush administration and corporatism ( a polite word for fascism . ) ; true investigative reporting is almost dead - and the Washington Post ( The Washington Compost would be a more befitting title ) , once a bellwether for breaking news that actually affected our lives and brought - down a President is now a government mouthpiece and their rank cowardice and fear and / or collusion with this administration will never be forgiven by the American public .
The New York Times ( New York Crimes … ) has on occasion presented us with some scathing editorials , some good , others mediocre at best , yet they still stand in humiliation for not breaking the scandal about US Wiretapping before the 2004 Presidential elections , and no matter how you parse it , the NY Times is partially responsible for Bush maintaining power and wrecking havoc on our economy - with Bush and Cheney wiping their butt ’s with the United States Constitution .
A President and Vice - President remain in power who make Nixon seem like a choir - boy ; Watergate does n’t compare with the least of their crimes , however that was before our media and Congress became compromised by what Ron Paul refers to as “ soft fascism . ”
Congressman Robert Wexler has to be commended on his efforts to bring the Cheney Impeachment issue back into the news , and even for a United States Congressman , he faced a complicit and cowardly MSM who refused to publish his Op - Ed’s , and finally , the Miami Herald broke the silence , and many others followed suit - an action which could be the beginning of the MSM coming to the realization that Americans want the truth - and their refusal to provide us with real news is affecting their bottom - lines ; it used to be that car salesmen and attorneys were ranked at the bottom of the list for their “ trust factor ” , but now that “ soft fascism ” is beginning to dominate America , the bulk of the MSM are viewed as cowards and liars - and millions view almost anything they publish with a wary eye , wondering whether it ’s truth or propaganda , or a clever assimilation for the two in an attempt to lend credibility to their lies !
Congressman Wexler and the Miami Herald should both be commended on their honesty LINK , although admittedly , it took some time before the Miami Herald finally published the story - but late is better than never , and I hope that everyone writes to the Editor and strongly thanks them for having the courage to defy the Bush administration .
We must recognize and laud those who have the courage to defy an administration that uses fear and intimidation as weapons in their plans to dismantle the constitution , and as others see the public holding those in high esteem that value liberty over fascism - the beginning of the end actually impacts those who are enemies of our way of life .
There is a War on Christianity , but the combatants are Christians themselves , and true Christianity is starting to win against the radicals that have been attempting to hijack Christianity and use it for their own political and financial gain .
You wo n’t necessarily hear it on the American MSM , however an article on the BBC illustrates how in Republican Kansas , things are beginning to change , and again , we must praise those who are attempting to bring back the true beliefs of Christianity :
Bible bashing dying out in Kansas By Justin Webb
BBC News , Washington
There is an American expression for something that is utterly obvious but not , for some reason , noticed .
“ Hiding in plain sight ” , the Americans call it , and the expression came to my mind as I sat in Kansas City airport waiting for an ice storm to pass .
Hiding in plain sight in this state is a revolution in American Christendom , a change of heart that could see American Protestant churches looking increasingly like their European equivalents .
MUCH MORE
On the flip - side of that coin is a Presidency that refuses to honor the constitutional principals of separation of church and state , and America ’s servicemen are being subjected to religious indoctrination in our armed services - a violation of our law and a slap in the face of those who fought and died so we in America would be a nation that respected the religious beliefs of all , not those chosen by a President that has a moral compass which is nonexistent and / or obscured by power and greed :
Evangelist Video Shot at Air Force Academy Exposed Anna Schecter Reports :
A video made by a Christian ministry group shows Air Force Academy cadets being pressured to become “ government paid missionaries when they leave ” the academy , according to the Military Religious Freedom Foundation ( MRFF ) , which released the video this week .
MRFF president Mikey Weinstein says the video is unconstitutional and an outrage .
“ This is absolutely out of control .
You cannot engage the U.S. government to propel your religion , ” said Weinstein .
MORE
To the best of my knowledge and belief , there ’s still a Press Blackout on S 1959 , the Thought Crime Prevention Bill ; this is an issue the American public is demanding answers to , and those of you who have been calling Congress , emailing them , and contacting the MSM caused the House of Representatives to issue a statement of “ clarification ” that clarified nothing , and was an example of double - speak and governmental spin , but the report itself was not discussed on the MSM , and the majority of our population are still unaware this Bill even exists !
It is this writer ’s belief that S 1959 is a Bill we cannot forget , and we need to keep demanding answers and force it into the Presidential debates - Republican and Democratic alike so the public can become aware of this assault on our constitution .

These were among the recent findings :
The share of young black men without jobs has climbed relentlessly , with only a slight pause during the economic peak of the late 1990's .
In 2000 , 65 percent of black male high school dropouts in their 20's were jobless -- that is , unable to find work , not seeking it or incarcerated .
By 2004 , the share had grown to 72 percent , compared with 34 percent of white and 19 percent of Hispanic dropouts .
Even when high school graduates were included , half of black men in their 20's were jobless in 2004 , up from 46 percent in 2000 .
Incarceration rates climbed in the 1990's and reached historic highs in the past few years .
In 1995 , 16 percent of black men in their 20's who did not attend college were in jail or prison ; by 2004 , 21 percent were incarcerated .
By their mid-30's , 6 in 10 black men who had dropped out of school had spent time in prison .
In the inner cities , more than half of all black men do not finish high school .
None of the litany of problems that young black men face was news to a group of men from the airless neighborhoods of Baltimore who recently described their experiences .
One of them , Curtis E. Brannon , told a story so commonplace it hardly bears notice here .
He quit school in 10th grade to sell drugs , fathered four children with three mothers , and spent several stretches in jail for drug possession , parole violations and other crimes .
" I was with the street life , but now I feel like I 've got to get myself together , " Mr. Brannon said recently in the row - house flat he shares with his girlfriend and four children .
" You get tired of incarceration . "
Mr. Brannon , 28 , said he planned to look for work , perhaps as a mover , and he noted optimistically that he had not been locked up in six months .
A group of men , including Mr. Brannon , gathered at the Center for Fathers , Families and Workforce Development , one of several private agencies trying to help men build character along with workplace skills .

In the article below we were wrong to say that the top of the Eiffel Tower would be reshaped in time for its 120th anniversary next year , in line with the winning design in a competition .
Serero Architects submitted an unsolicited design for a new viewing platform , which has not been approved by the tower 's management group .
The elegant , tapering signature of the Eiffel Tower is to be reshaped , altering the skyline of Paris , in time for the structure 's 120th anniversary next year , the Société d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel ( Sete ) has just announced .
Serero Architects of Paris has won the competition to redesign the structure 's public viewing platform and reception areas .
The winning design ( above ) , which will be 276 metres ( 905 ft ) above the ground , will not require any permanent modification of the existing structure .
It will double the capacity of the public viewing area on the tower 's top floor .
The new platform will be bolted onto the tower using a web of Kevlar , an extremely strong and lightweight aramid fibre used in the construction of racing cars and body armour .
The new platform will use a cantilevered design similar to the way that an aircraft 's wings are attached to the fuselage .
The design is already causing controversy , with critics questioning the wisdom of tinkering with the famous silhouette and spending money on upgrading a tourist attraction which attracts 6.9 million visitors a year .
In a statement , a spokesperson for Sete explained that the plan to restructure the top of the tower aims to increase the quality of access .
Average waiting times for the tower 's elevators currently run at more than an hour at peak times .
Gustave Eiffel designed the tower as a temporary structure for the 1889 World 's Fair .
Initially rejected by the French public , it is now the most visited fee- charging monument in the world .
· This article was amended on Thursday March 27 2008 .
In the article above we described Kevlar as an extremely strong and lightweight carbon fibre .
Kevlar is an aramid fibre , not a carbon fibre .
This has been corrected .
Adobe released Photoshop Express this week , its first SaaS ( Software as a Service ) offering in the form of a free Web - based photo editing , organizing , and sharing service .
The early reaction to this ( naturally ) beta program has been positive , but a few aggressive terms in its EULA have caused some to put down their color adjustment palettes .
While Adobe has already stated that it is rewriting the terms in question , it has still joined the growing list of major software shops who are n't paying attention to their own EULAs .
Specifically , the Photoshop Express terms that got people 's exposure sliders in a twist are on page two of the service 's terms disclosure ( unavailable as of this writing ) :
Use of Your Content .
Adobe does not claim ownership of Your Content .
However , with respect to Your Content that you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Services , you grant Adobe a worldwide , royalty - free , nonexclusive , perpetual , irrevocable , and fully sublicensable license to use , distribute , derive revenue or other remuneration from , reproduce , modify , adapt , publish , translate , publicly perform and publicly display such Content ( in whole or in part ) and to incorporate such Content into other Materials or works in any format or medium now known or later developed .
In other words : uploading photos to the Photoshop Express site gives Adobe the right to do whatever it wants with them .
The company could begin selling your shots as stock photography or use that killer family pic as the box art for Photoshop Elements 7 , without giving you so much as a credit for the image or a dime of royalty dues .
When we contacted Adobe about the policy , a reply confirmed that someone at Adobe did n't think this was a very good policy either .
From Adobe 's response :
We 've heard your concerns about the terms of service for Photoshop Express beta .
We reviewed the terms in context of your comments - and we agree that it currently implies things we would never do with the content .
Therefore , our legal team is making it a priority to post revised terms that are more appropriate for Photoshop Express users .
We will alert you once we have posted new terms .
Thank you for your feedback on Photoshop Express beta and we appreciate your input .
This should be good news for enthusiastic Photoshop Express users who are worried about their content rights , but the situation still highlights the growing problems that some large software developers are having with their own EULAs .
Apple earlier this week was caught with a mistake in its own EULA for Safari that stated the browser could only be run on an Apple - branded computer .
The company quickly fixed its license once the issue was pointed out , but Safari 's been running on Redmond 's OS for nearly a year with the mistaken EULA restriction in place .
While Apple obviously would n't have sued any Windows users for running Safari , this was still a glaring mistake that makes one wonder what else users are hastily agreeing to the when they install the software .
Ultimately , Adobe 's adventures with the Photoshop Express EULA sound like they 'll have a happy ending , but we do n't have to tell you twice that the EULA is becoming all the more important in a world where even more of our data and work is going digital and online .
A ( Very ) Short Course in Internal Ballistics
Internal ballistic , or the science of what goes on inside of the gun , is a very complicated topic .
This page is not designed to give you a degree in the field but rather to provide some background data to help you understand the subject .
Fr. Frog 's Rules of Internal Ballistics
1 ) There ai n't no magic powders !
2 ) There are no magic cartridge cases !
3 ) Details !
It 's in the details .
4 ) Inconsequential increments are meaningless .
5 ) Most gun writers are pathological liars .
Definition of Terms
Barrel Length -
In interior ballistic work this differs from the " barrel length " use in general measurements .
It is measured from the face of the muzzle to the base of the seated bullet or base of the case neck .
Bulk Density -
The ratio of the weight of a given volume of powder vs. the weight of the same volume of water .
Burning Rate -
A arbitrary index of the quickness that burning propellant changes into gas .
Burning rate is controlled by the chemical composition , the size and shape of the propellant grains , coatings , and the pressure at which the burning takes place .
IMR 5010 powder is very slow burning and Bullseye is fast burning .
For a chart of comparative burning rates for current commercial powders you can click here .
CUP - Copper Units of Pressure .
In this pressure measuring technique a hole is drilled in the chamber and a piston fitted that presses on a calibrated copper slug ( or crusher ) .
( Some set ups also drill the cartridge case which changes the results compared to non-drilled cases . )
The whole assembly is held in place with a yoke .
When the cartridge is fired the piston presses on the crusher and deforms it lengthwise slightly .
Measurement of the length change is used with a lookup table supplied with each lot of crushers to determine the peak pressure .
The total deformation is effected by both the peak pressure and by shape of the pressure curve around the peak pressure .
This method tends to give readings slightly lower than the actual peak pressure .
A typical reading might be stated as 47,500 CUP which is supposed to be close to the actual average psi measurement .
This method has been largely superseded by piezo - electric and strain gauge units which replace the copper slug with a crystal or strain gauge which changes its electrical properties in response to pressure or dimensional changes .
Such measurements are stated in PSI .
For low pressures a lead crusher can be used and measurements are in LUP .
Typical Dual Measurement ( Copper & Piezo - Electric ) Pressure Gun
Expansion Ratio -
The ratio of the capacity of the powder chamber plus bore ( in grains of water ) to the capacity of the powder chamber ( in grains of water ) .
Loading Density -
The ratio of the weight of the powder charge to the capacity of the powder chamber ( case ) .
It is usually expressed as the ratio of the charge weight to the capacity the powder chamber in grains of water .
( See below . )
Generally , the more fully the powder charge fills the case the more consistent and accurate the load will be .
On the other hand if the loading density is too low , ( too much free space in the case ) it can cause erratic ignition , change in the pressure curve ( moving the peak towards the muzzle ) , or even overly rapid burning ( " detonation " ) of the powder charge .
( One reason manuals list minimum or starting loads . )
PSI - Pounds per square inch .
It is sometimes seen designated as PSIA .
This designation is now used to signify a measurement of chamber pressure taken with a piezo - electric device or a strain gage .
Piezo - electric units operate in a similar fashion to the copper crusher units but use a reusable crystal " crusher " that changes its electrical properties in response to pressure .
When connected to suitable recording equipment the entire pressure pulse history can be recorded or displayed .
The peak pressure recorded by a piezo - electric peak device usually reads higher than the figure determined by the copper crusher method and depending on the cartridge and the pressures involved the differences can range between 3,000 and 15,000 units ..
There are also electronic strain gauge units .
These work by measuring the expansion of the chamber area on firing by means of device that changes its electrical properties as it changes size .
These devices are very sensitive and if one knows the thickness of the walls of the cartridge case and the thickness of the chamber wall , very accurate and detailed information on the pressure curve can be generated .
Strain gauge on a dime
( Measuring the strain on the economy ??? )
Strain gauge mounted on rifle
( The white block is the connector
Piezo ( PSI ) and strain gauge ( PSI ) are not directly relatable to copper crusher ( CUP ) due to the differences in the sensitivity of the copper crusher versus the other methods used to measure the pressure .
However , new statistical data analysis suggests that for most cartridges ANSI / SAAMI Maximum Average Piezo ( PSI ) and Maximum Average copper crusher ( CUP ) taken in a " standard " barrel can be approximated by the following formula which has an R2 value ( a statistical measurement of certainty ) of .927 .
( 1.51586 * CUP ) - 17902.0 = PSI
While the relationship is generally within 3 Kpsi ( it assumes that the CUP was determined using ANSI / SAAMI standards ) one should not rely on this conversion for absolute maximum loads .
Interestingly the correlation between the European CIP CUP measurements and Piezo measurements has an even better correlation with an R2 of .997 .
The formula for the CIP conversion is
( 1.20911 * CIPCUP ) - 2806.88 = PSI
The same warning about using this conversion for maximum load work applies to this formula .
Comparison of Pressure Specifications Between Copper Crusher and Piezo
SAAMI Specifications for .308 Win. Max Average Pressure Max Probable
Lot Mean Max Probable
Sample Mean Copper Units of Pressure ( CUP ) 52,000 53,300 55,300 PSI ( Piezo / Strain gauge ) 62,000 63,600 66,000
Powder Chamber Capacity -
As with most interior ballistics capacity measurements it is usually expressed in grains of water .
It is determined by measuring the weight of water that a fired case from the test firearm can contain with a bullet seated to its normal depth .
Note that this varies with different bullets or seating depth as well as the dimensions of the chamber , and the brand of case .
Sectional Density -
The is the bullet 's weight in pounds divided by its diameter squared .
Charge Weight to Bullet Weight ratio -
This is the ratio of the weight of the powder charge to the weight of the projectile .
What Affects What
Among the things that affect the internal performance ( pressure and velocity ) of a given cartridge & bullet are :
Capacity of the powder chamber ( a function of chamber size and shape , case construction , and bullet seating depth )
Relative burning rate and burning characteristics of the propellant powder used
Amount of propellant used and how much it fills the powder chamber ( load density )
Diameter , weight , and the bearing area of the projectile
Length and interior dimensions of the barrel
Uniformity and speed of ignition of the propellant powder ( Primer and loading density related )
Temperature of the propellant prior to ignition
Barrel freebore
Neck tension
Some Powder Basics
There are basically five types of gunpowder .
Black powder , semi- smokeless , pseudo black powder ( " Pyrodex " ) , and smokeless .
Black Powder
In the west it is generally attributed to Roger Bacon or Berthold Schwartz circa the 1200s , but they basically popularized what had been known for a long time and did not invent it .
It was undoubtedly known to the early Chinese and Hindu people of India .
Some early writings , circa 1300 BC , from these cultures speak of such a substance though it was used as an incendiary or a demolition device and not in " firearms . "
It is also clear that such a substance was known to the ancient Greeks .
The earliest known use of it as propellant in firearms was by the Arabs circa 1150 in their war with the Iberians .
While the exact proportions have varied over the years , black powder is basically a finely ground mixture of about 15 % charcoal , 10 % sulfur , and 75 % potassium nitrate .
Black powder burns so rapidly that it actually explodes even with minimal confinement and unlike modern smokeless powders it is classed as an " explosive " .
Other than for historical recreational shooting and the manufacture of some types of blank ammunition , black powder is not in general use any more , and with the recent " anti-terror " controls it is getting more difficult to obtain .
Brown Powder
This almost unknown powder was made using under - burnt charcoal and gave performance not very far below later smokeless powders .
Coming at the end of the black powder age it was superceded after little more than a decade .
Most people have never heard of it .
There is a reference on it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_powder .
There was also a similar high performance powder that used woodworm dust as the " charcoal " c.1583 , that was used by Spanish aristocracy as it was deemed to expensive for " common " use
Semi-smokeless
In the late 1800s and early 1900s there was a type of powder known as Semi-smokeless .
This was a mixture of black powder and gun cotton ( nitrocellulose ) .
Unfortunately the use of raw nitrocellulose made its manufacture very hazardous and with the advent of modern smokeless powders it was discontinued in the late 1940s .
Pseudo Black Powder ( Pyrodex and similar products )
Pseudo black powders such as Pyrodex , Blackthorn 209 , Shockley 's Gold , and others are a modern substitute for black powder and remedy the explosive and fouling problems of black powder .
Due to its chemical make - up , pseudo black powder is classified as a flammable solid not as an explosive .
Pyrodex can be substituted volume - for - volume for black powder .
Smokeless Powder
The majority of today 's small arms smokeless powders are made of either a nitrocellulose base , referred to as single base powders , and typified by the IMR powders , or of a nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine mix ( usually from 3 to 39 percent ) , called double base powders , which include powders like Bullseye , 2400 , and Hi-Vel # 2 .
An early form of smokeless powder was Cordite , which was a double based propellant made of 65 % nitroglycerine , by weight , 30 % guncotton and 5 % petroleum jelly , and loaded as spaghetti - like strings of powder .
There are also some special double base ball powders available in non-canister powders .
Double base powders have a higher energy potential than single base powders .
Some modern powders referred to as " triple base " now incorporate an additional ingredient like nitroguanidine , but these , like the double based ball powders are not in wide distribution except military powders and some commercial grade non-canister powders .
They can yield a substantial increase in velocities while maintaining normal peak pressures as they give a longer , flatter pressure curve .
In addition some manufactures are using " blended powders " for some of their high performance ammunition .
The grains of modern smokeless propellant powders are made in various sizes and shapes to give the best results in the firearm they are designed to be used in .
Powder for the 16 " naval cannon has grains almost an inch in diameter and 2 ½ inches long while typical modern rifle powder has grains only 2/32 or 3/32 of an inch long and maybe a 1/32 of an inch wide .
The smaller the grain the faster it burns .
Modern powders are available in tubular grains , spherical grains , and flakes .
Most tubular grained powders have a hole through the center of the grain to allow burning to take place from both the inside and outside surfaces .
Without the hole , as the grain burned its surface area would decrease and the amount of gas would decrease as the grain burned .
Powders of this type , called digressive powders , give peak pressures when the bullet is close to the breech and a low muzzle pressure .
By putting a hole down the center of the grain the burning area stays more constant and the maximum pressure point is moved to a point where the bullet has moved further down the bore .
These types of powders are called neutral burning .
Another way of controlling the burning rate is with the use of a coating as used with ball powders , which are made with spherically shaped grains .
The coating on the powder grain tends to hold back the rate of burning until the coating has burned through .
These powders , called progressive burning give a peak pressure at a point in bullet travel even further along .
Coating technology is important in small arms powders since without it the grains would sometimes have to be larger than practical .
Much has been made about ball powders being cooler burning than extruded powders , but the fact of the matter is that there really is n't much difference .
Flame temperature is very close to the same for all smokeless powders and runs about 3300 degrees F . Ball type powders tend to be from 3200 to 3300 degrees F and extruded powders tend to run 3300 to 3400 degrees F but there is wide variation .
As a technical point of interest , conventional small arms propellant powders have an energy potential of about 178 ft lb per grain of weight .
However , in practice this figure is not even closely approached because of various energy losses -- such as the energy used in forcing the bullet into the rifling , overcoming bore friction , heating the barrel , and giving the powder gases their high velocity , etc. -- that are inherent and unavoidable .
According to The World s Great Rifles , by Roger Ford ( 1998 , Brown Packaging Books , Ltd. , London ) it is estimated that just one - fifth of one percent of the energy produced when a cartridge is fired goes to rotating the bullet , while friction in the barrel accounts for another three percent , 20 to 30 percent goes to propelling the bullet , 30 percent goes in heat to the barrel , and 40 percent goes in muzzle blast .
Contrary to media myths , smokeless powder is not an explosive but rather a highly flammable solid .
( Note that we are talking about smokeless powders here . )
As an example , one of the large powder grains used in the 16 " naval cannon can actually be lit while held in the hand and then blown out .
Even individual grains of modern small arms powders burn very slowly .
But , when several grains or a pile of them are ignited together the heat generated by each burning grain makes the adjacent grains burn even faster .
A very small pile of smokeless powder burned in the open may seem harmless but the resulting rapid ignition can cause such a rapid build up of heat that a person may not be able to get away fast enough to avoid injury .
Inside of a cartridge case the same process happens but on a much shorter time scale .
Bang !
( What happens when the trigger is pulled . )
When you pull the trigger and the primer fires , the intense flame created by the priming compound fills the interior of the cartridge case and ignites the powder charge .
The more nearly the powder charge fills the case the less the powder gases generated by the burning powder can expand without doing work and the more the heat generated accelerates the burning process as described above .
( Thus a full or nearly full case of powder is more efficient than a partially filled case . )
The increasing pressures generated by the burning powder pushes the bullet down the barrel .
If the bullet is heavy , tightly held into the neck of the cartridge , or if it is a tight fit in the rifling then the confinement of the powder is accentuated and the burning is proceeds more quickly than if these conditions were not present -- in other words you get higher pressures more quickly .
The graph below is a representative pressure curve of a typical cartridge ( in this case from the M193 5.56 mm cartridge using 846 ball powder ) .
Notice how the peak pressure rises quickly and then tapers off .
The location of the peak pressure and the shape of the pressure curve is determined by the burning characteristics of the powder used and the loading density .
Slower burning powders tend to have a flatter curve while faster powders a steeper curve .
The gas port pressure curve on this chart shows a critical part of internal ballistics for cartridges used in gas operated firearms .
Gas operated weapons are generally tailored to a narrow range of powder burning rates and characteristics .
If the port pressure is too low the weapon will fail to function and if to high the weapon may function too forcefully or rapidly causing extraction or cycling problems .
A poorly researched change of powder from an IMR type to a ball powder and the subsequent change of port pressure and fouling was what caused all those nightmare stories about the M16 during the early days of the Vietnam war .
Another very good graphical representation of what happens is shown on page 322 of " Hatcher 's Notebook " , ( by Julian S. Hatcher , 3rd edition , June 1962 , Stackpole Books , ISBN : 0811707954 ) but the graph is a little data dense for good reproduction here .
It is similar to what is shown above but it is based upon the .30 - '06 cartridge , and along with the pressure curve it shows bullet velocity and time of bullet travel .
As can be seen from the above graph , the longer the barrel the more time the powder has to work on moving the bullet , thus you get higher velocities with a longer barrel - - all else being equal .
However , while not often reached with high powered rifles there is a point at which additional barrel length does not increase velocity , but rather causes a decrease .
As the bullet moves down the bore and the gas pressure behind it decreases there will come a time -- with a sufficiently long barrel -- that the bore friction and the air pressure in front of the bullet will equal the pressure behind it .
At that point velocity will start to decrease .
With the .22 rimfire that point is reached in about 14 " - 16 " of barrel .
Beyond that length no velocity increase occurs , and in fact the bullet can slow down , but the extra length may be useful for other things such as increased sight radius or legal requirements .
If we have to keep barrel length reasonable , the way to get more velocity is to either change the burning characteristics of the powder so it gives higher pressures over a longer time ( as is done with the powders in the new " enhanced performance " ammunition now available from Hornady and Federal ) , or to simply burn more powder by using a bigger cartridge case .
By using a cartridge case with greater capacity we provide for more chamber volume with the same bore volume , thus the expansion ratio ( see definitions above ) becomes less .
As a result , the powder gases have been through less expansion by the time they reach the muzzle and muzzle pressure is higher .
As the muzzle pressure is higher , the average pressure along the bore is higher and the bullet has a higher velocity .
There is a trade off for this .
Because the muzzle pressure is higher , more energy is carried off into the air unused ( as flash and muzzle blast ) and thus the efficiency of the load ( the getting of energy out of the powder charge ) is less .
Here is a sample output from PressureTrace for a 6 PPCcartridge .
The only difference between all these traces is the first 3 were seated right on the lands .
The last 4 were 30 thousands of an inch off the lands .
Note the substantially reduced pressure and overall reduction in energy .
As the bullet broke it 's neck tension and jumped to the lands it provides more expansion room for the gases reducing both the energy and velocity .
The Hacksaw Effect
( Sometimes referred to as " get shorty . " )
The often asked the question , " How much velocity will I lose if I shorten my barrel " x " inches ? " is tied quite closely to the expansion ratio , although the type of powder also plays a part .
Thus there is no clear cut general answer as to just how much velocity is lost per inch of barrel shortening .
Rifles with high expansion ratios tend to lose less velocity as the barrel is shortened than do rifles with low expansion ration .
Thus a .300 Win Mag will lose more velocity per inch of barrel than say a .30 - '06 and it is not uncommon for a smaller cartridge in a long barrel to out perform a big bottle cartridge in a short barrel as some folks found out to their dismay when they chronographed their 22 " razzle - dazzle magnums next to their buddies convention calibers with 24 " barrels .
Because of the fact that " high velocity " cartridges generally have low expansion ratios ( big cases in relation to bore diameter ) one can make some generalizations .
The chart below will give you some idea of what can be expected if you cut your barrel shorter within the range of 20 " to 26 " .
Remember , your mileage may vary from this chart .
Note that this chart does not hold true if we are comparing different barrels of different lengths .
In that case it is quite possible , due to certain barrel design parameters , for a short barrel to give higher velocity than a longer one with the same ammunition .

Mathematical Calculation of Internal Ballistics for the End User
There are some " mathematical " methods of computing a fairly close approximation of the actual internal performance ( i.e. : chamber pressure and muzzle velocity ) of a given combination of cartridge , firearm , bullet , and powder but their details are beyond the scope of this page .
The " Powley Computer , " a slide rule type device was at one time available and gives rather good results when used with the " IMR " type of powders and cases of similar capacity to the .308 and .30 - 06 .
It is based on some mathematically derived " constants " developed at Frankord Arsenal which provide a close approximation to the results derived by some rather complex mathematical gyrations .
Several computer - based adaptations of these calculations are available from different sources ( such as the rather expensive QuickLoad program ) and all suffer from the limitations of being based upon the Frankfort Arsenal model of the .308/.30-06 .
As far as I know the Powley Computer is no longer available although Powley 's code has been privately adapted to computer use by various people .
As mentioned previously these computations are based upon case capacities and pressures in the .308 Win & .30 - 06 range .
For cartridges of significantly larger or smaller capacities , or lower pressures , the result will be not be accurate and can frequently be dangerous if you do n't understand what is what ..
There was a website that allowed you to make your own slide rule computer , but it is no longer active .
However , there is an online adaptation of the Powley Computer available at http://kwk.us/powley.html
Mechanical / Electrical Calculation of Internal Ballistics for the End User
Consumer Crusher Systems
Crusher based pressure systems are generally beyond the means of the average shooter .
At one time there was available a " do - it - yourself " pressure measuring device using a " crusher " type tool .
Rather than utilizing a drilled chamber this unit was mounted on a firearm in place of the telescopic sight and when the firearm was fired the recoil impulse compressed the crusher which could be measured and compared to a calibrated table .
Unfortunately , the unit was tricky to set up , required very precise measurements of the firearm 's weight , and if memory serves me right worked best when the firearm was unrestrained in recoil ( as in hanging from support wires ) .
It was also only really suitable for rifles .
Strain Gauge Systems
There are moderately priced electronic strain gauge unit available that do a better job and allow one to see the pressure curve on an oscilloscope or a computer screen and which do n't require a special free swinging support .
The $ 500ish PressureTrace II system and the the no longer available $ 800 Oehler Model 43 " Ballistic System " with its $ 170 add - on a strain gauge pressure sensor are examples of this technology .
Strain gauge units with real - time microprocessor compensation such as PresureTrace II have been shown to actually be more accurate than either piezo or crusher measurements .
By utilizing certain easily measurable parameters of the chamber wall thickness and cartridge case wall thickness in the firmware and software , the measurements from strain gauge units give results that are accurately given in PSI .
( If no compensation is utilized with a strain gauges , the measurements are in arbitrary units , such as " coconuts " as my friend says , which still can be used for comparison readings .
Strain gages have been used in industrial instrumentation for several decades and is fully developed , proven technology .
Denton Bramwell , ( physicist and statistician with a great deal of test instrumentation experience ) recently compared the results of various pressure measurement methods .
He used a standard measure of how likely a system will give correct answers called " Sigma E " for comparison .
( Smaller Sigma E values are best . )

The PressureTrace II unit gives you the actual readings in your firearm , while the Oehler unit converted its measurements to what would probably be obtained by the load in a SAAMI specification test barrel .
For the details on the PressureTrace II go to http://www.shootingsoftware.com/pressure.htm.
I have worked with RSI on the development and production of the PressureTrace II unit and I personally use it .
It is VERY neat but not inexpensive , running around $ 500 .
If you do order one I 'd appreciate it if you would let RSI know that I sent you by telling Jim .
NOTE : While you can reliably compare the pressure generated by your handloads with the pressures generated by factory ammunition fired in your gun , or compare the pressures from different handloads in the same gun , strain gauges or recoil based pressure devices do not generate " SAAMI specification " pressure measurements ( either PSI or CUP ) even thought the results are probably more accurate , because SAAMI specifications currently requires piezo or crusher pressure technology and certain convoluted statistical analysis of the data , as well as requiring that the barrel and chamber be minimum specification to provide " worst case " data .
Does it really matter ?
No .
Case Head Expansion
Some people think it is possible to estimate pressures from cartridge case head expansion .
This has been shown to be incorrect and there is little if any correlation between case head expansion and pressures .
Rather than reinvent the wheel here visit http://www.shootingsoftware.com/ftp/dbramwell%20july%2019%2004.pdf for an in depth discussion .
Continuing on ...
We know that as pressure goes up , so does velocity .
Pressure goes down , so does velocity .
If you are worried about pressures , and do n't have access to pressure equipment , develop your loads using a soft primer like Winchesters and a chronograph and find the top node or stop when you get flattening or cratering .
Then switch to a harder primer and adjust your load to give the node velocity .
While these pressure measuring devices can be very informative for someone with a interest in interior ballistics and the effect that things like different powders and seating depths , most folks who buy these sort of devices do n't understand barrel harmonics and velocity nodes .
( See the discussion of " load development . " )
They hope to be able to load all the way up and wring the last foot - second of velocity out of their guns .
They forget that the top velocity / accuracy node reachable without signs of excessive pressure ( primer flattening / cratering ) is the top practical limit for a firearm .
So , what good is being able to " read " pressure ?
Using PressureTrace
II can let you see the effect of burning rates on pressure curves and and the effect of the change of the shape of the pressure curve all of which have an effect on velocity .
For many folks it is simply fun to see what is going on .
With a highly sensitive unit with a high sample rate like PressureTrace II you can also see the effect of many other things like neck tension , seating depth and powder / bullet / cartridge match .
In addition if you are trying to work up a load for a cartridge with little or no published data , a pressure unit can help to keep you safe if you start with data for a cartridge with a similar case capacity and then slowly work up from the lowest pressure loads .
If you are working with modified non-standard chamber designs or rifling you can see what is happening and work up safe loads rather than guessing .
The loading data for the DMR chamber design for the 6.8 x 43 mm ( 6.8 SPC ) was developed using a PressureTrace II unit .
Rules of the Road
( Or , things to keep in mind when developing loads )
Rule 1 - Do n't do anything stupid .
Rule 2 - For a given load a 3 percent rise in velocity requires a 6 percent rise in chamber pressure .
Rule 3 - For a 3 percent change in case capacity chamber pressure changes by 6 percent .
Remember that case capacity varies drastically between brands of cases and that bullet seating depth also changes case capacity .
Rule 4 - Changing ANY component can drastically effect chamber pressure .
Rule 5 - You DO NOT need to wring the last possible foot - second of velocity out of your ammunition -- it wo n't do anything for you .
An accurate / moderate velocity load is better than an inaccurate / fast load .
( See the external ballistics and load development pages )
Rule 6 - Temperature affects chamber pressure .
While the effect differs with each powder , over the range of about 0 º F to 125 º F most modern commercial powders are fairly stable showing pressure variation of up to ± 3000 psi from loads developed at 70 º
F .
Out side of this range the effect is still there but not as linear . )
While most current ball powders handle temperatures changes well some types have exhibited a very non-linear response especially at temperature extremes outside of the above range and can result in catastrophic changes in pressures at temperatures much higher than the original temperature .
Loads with any powders should be carefully worked up if their use in extreme temperatures is expected especially if at near maximum ( Click here for a chart of temperature effects . )
Rule 7 - Do n't do anything stupid .
Remember , Watcha - U- Back
(...or , once again , do n't do anything stupid )
Unless you are well versed in internal ballistics leave the development of loading data with new powders to the experts with the proper tools , and do n't play around with unknown powders .
More than one firearm has been destroyed when the wrong powder was used without proper knowledge .
As an example , in the 50s and 60s there were a lot of blow ups caused by people trying to use the powder from GI .30 - 06 blanks in pistols and rifles .
What these poor souls did n't realize was that the " EC " powder in those blanks burned so fast that it was also used as a grenade filler .
These folks turned their firearms into " grenades " with quite small charges of this powder .
By the same token many powders of vastly different burning rates look similar .
If it 's not in the original can , do n't use it !
Leave new load development to the pros and stick with the data in reliable loading manuals .
Bullet Stability
While some may think that bullet stability is an external ballistics issue , it really starts in the bore .
Bullets are stabilized in flight by the gyroscopic effect of their spinning and their spin rate is determined by their muzzle velocity and the rate of twist in the barrel .
A badly unstable bullet will actually wobble or tumble in flight resulting in extremely poor accuracy .
The needed rate of twist is effected by the diameter of the bullet , the bullet 's weight , and the bullet 's overall length .
Longer bullets need a faster twist to stabilize .
As an example , a 1:12 twist in .30 caliber will adequately stabilized most commercial bullets of up to about 173 grains ( depending on the overall length ) .
To use a heavier ( longer ) bullet or to obtain optimum stability and accuracy with long pointed or boat tailed bullets of that weight requires a 1:10 twist .
For best accuracy the slowest twist that will stabilize the bullet should be used .
Bullet stability is describe by a number called the Gyroscopic Stability Factor .
A stability factor of from 1.25 to 2 is considered " stable . "
Below that range the bullet is most likely not stable enough for accurate flight .
Above that range the bullet may be spinning so fast that it may physically rupture from the forces involved , or minute imbalances that normally would not come to light begin to cause problems .
There is an old formula called the Greenhill Formula that , while it was designed for estimating twists for boat tailed lead core bullets of moderate velocity , does a pretty good job of estimating twist required for flat based bullets under " normal " conditions .
T = Twist in inches
K = Greenhill 's constant = 150 ( This has to do with the specific gravity of a jacketed lead bullet )
D = Bullet diameter in inches
L = Bullet length in inches T = ( K * D2 ) / L
Using a 1.35 inch long .308 bullet ( 173 gr ) and crunching the numbers we get about 10.5 ( One turn in 10.5 " , which is pretty close to the 1:10 twist normally used in .30 - 06 rifles .
The twist for the .308 is nominally 1:12 because it was based on the shorter bullet of the 150 gr military ammunition from which the .308 commercial round was developed .
Most match rifles in .308 have a 1:10 twist to stabilize the 180 and 190 boat tailed match bullets better .
The results from the Greenhill formula are on the conservative side -- indicating a faster twist than probably needed .
That does n't cause any problems because a little too much stabilization is better than too little .
However , the one big catch with the Greenhill formula is that it does not account for the effects of temperature or muzzle velocity .
As temperature or velocity decreases a faster twist is needed to maintain the same level of stability .
Colder and thus denser air has a more destabilizing affect than warmer air .
A lower muzzle velocity results in a slower rotational speed of the bullet and thus less stability .
As an example of the effect of temperature , the original M16 rifle for the M193 55 gr ball came out with a 1:14 twist which was barely stable at 68 degrees and which was totally unstable below about 40 degrees .
They changed to a 1:12 twist to get stability ( barely ) at colder temperatures .
The M855 62 gr round is unstable below about 65 degrees with the 1:12 twist and requires a 1:9 twist to be stable .
They went to a 1:7 twist because the M856 tracer round has a very long bullet , but the ball round does just fine in 1:9 .
Modern bullet stability calculations are based upon the work of the late Robert L. McCoy who was a ballistician with the Ballistic Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground .
His work , now used in advanced ballistics programs , accurately takes into account all of the factors involved in bullet stability and accurately describe the bullet 's behavior at a given muzzle velocity and twist rate and generates a stability factor for a range of muzzle velocities .
For velocity issues long bullets are more susceptible than short ones .
For example the above 173 gr .308 bullet in a 1:12 twist barrel is stable from at muzzle velocities of 4000 f/s down to about 500 f/s .
Below that muzzle velocity it becomes unstable .
If we turn the design into a VLD bullet with a length of 1.45 " ( a VLD design has a longer more pointed ogive so the bullet itself gets longer ) the bullet is stable for muzzle velocities from 4000 f/s to 3,000 f/s in a 1:12 twist .
Going to a 1:11 twist the bullet is stable at muzzle velocities of 4,000 f/s down to about 1150 f/s , and going to a 1:10 twist make the bullet stable at muzzle velocities of 4000 f/s down to about 500 f/s
Another catch with the Greenhill formula is that Greenhill assumes that the bullet 's specific gravity is 10.9 ( a lead cored jacketed bullet ) .
For other bullet construction such as a steel core you need to apply a fudge factor by determining the bullets specific gravity .
The formula would be :
Twist = [ Square Root ( 10.9 / specific gravity of the new bullet ) ] * twist derived for a lead core bullet
You can determine the specific gravity of a bullet thusly :
1 ) Suspend the bullet at its balance point from the pan of a scale .
2 ) Weight the bullet .
3 ) Place a container of water under the scale so the bullet hangs fully in the water and weigh the bullet .
4 ) Subtract the weight obtained in step 3 from the weight obtained in step 2
5 ) Divide the weight obtained in step 2 by the difference obtained in step 4 .
As an interesting exercise you can also determine the spin needed in mediums other than air under " standard conditions " by multiplying the spin for air by the square root of the number obtained by dividing the density of the medium in question by the density of air .
As an example water is about 900 times as dense as air : 900 / 1 = 900 and the square root of 900 is 30 .
Thus you need a twist 30 times as fast to stabilize a bullet in water .
Sharp eyed reader may note that the McCoy stability computations are based upon muzzle velocity .
This is the case because the rotational speed decays much more slowly than velocity decay .
Most of the research in this area was done by the Ballistics Research Lab at Aberdeen Proving Ground and Picatinny Arsenal on artillery projectiles which have narrow driving bands that are engaged by the rifling rather than full body length rifling engraving on the bullet as with small arms projectiles .
Thus there are some approximations made on spin decay for small arms projectiles .
For the M80 147 gr 7.62 NATO bullet at 2750 f/s which has been studied and investigated thoroughly , the approximate spin decay at range is linear as shown below .
The decay rate probably holds true for other small arms cartridges .
Range Muzzle 100 200 300 400 500 1000 Percent of spin remaining 100 98 96 93 91 89 75 Bullet RPM 198,000 194,000 190,000 184,000 180,000 176,000 148,500

Here 's what happens ...
when you live in Michigan and take a vacation to Disneyworld in the
middle of winter and turn off the heat but forget to turn off the water .
( CNN ) --
It 's all tied up in Texas .
Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running a tight race in Texas .
A new CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois is a statistical dead heat in Texas , which holds primaries March 4 .
In the survey , out Monday , 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party 's nominee , with 48 percent backing Obama .
But taking into account the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus 4 ½ percentage points for Democratic respondents , the race is a virtual tie .
Watch Democrats target Texas . »
Two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even .
Map : National and state polling
" One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options , " says CNN polling director Keating Holland .
" Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination , and they do n't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues .
" Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly , those people are splitting roughly equally between Clinton and Obama . "
Many political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must - win states for Clinton .
Obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates , 193 of which are at stake in Texas .
The new survey indicates Arizona Sen .
John McCain is the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination .
Among Republicans , 55 percent of likely Texas GOP primary voters support McCain as their choice for nominee .
Thirty - two percent back former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and 11 percent support home - state congressman and former Libertarian standard - bearer Ron Paul .
The poll 's sampling error for Republican respondents is 4 percentage points .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday .
Pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Texas , including 553 likely Republican primary voters and 529 likely Democratic primary voters .
McCain is the overwhelming front - runner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity .
The poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president -- George Herbert Walker Bush , the current president 's father -- endorsed McCain at an event in Houston .
Watch McCain get a big boost »
But McCain has had trouble winning conservative voters .
Just last week , McCain lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Virginia primary , according to exit polls .
The new survey , though , suggests McCain may have better luck in Texas .
" It looks like McCain has made some inroads with conservative Republicans , " Holland said .
" McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary .
The McCain campaign probably wishes that number were higher , but it does mean that a McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents , as has happened in several states in the past few weeks . "
Texas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues , but the poll suggests they do agree on what 's the most important issue .
Thirty - five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president .
The second most important issue for Democrats was health care , at 23 percent , followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent , illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent .
Nineteen percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue , putting it in second place , followed by the war in Iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent .
Sixty percent of Republicans say they 'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing .
That number climbs to 76 percent for Democrats .
Likely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms .
Seventy - nine percent say they would be satisfied if Clinton were the nominee ; an equal number feel the same way about Obama .
Seventy - nine percent say it 's likely Clinton can win the nomination ; 82 percent say the same about Obama .
The two candidates are essentially tied on immigration , Iraq and the economy , but Clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion .

All About U.S. Presidential Election
Nearly three in four say Second Amendment guarantees this right
PRINCETON , NJ -- A solid majority of the U.S. public , 73 % , believes the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the rights of Americans to own guns .
Twenty percent believe the amendment only guarantees the rights of state militia members to own guns .
The Supreme Court will soon weigh in on this issue , after recently hearing the arguments in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller , in which the Washington , D.C. , ban on handgun ownership by city residents is facing a Second Amendment challenge .
The precise language of the Second Amendment reads :
A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed .
The often fierce debate over the Second Amendment has centered on whether it was intended to protect the rights of all Americans to own guns , or only those who are members of state militia groups .
The poll makes it clear which side Americans come down on .
Gun owners ( roughly one - third of the U.S. adult population ) are nearly universal in endorsing the view that the Second Amendment guarantees their right to own guns .
Non-owners are less likely to view the amendment this way , but a majority still do .
While the American public backs the view that gun ownership is a constitutional right , Americans favor having legal restrictions on it .
In the same poll , 49 % favor stricter gun laws than exist now and 38 % would like to see gun laws remain as they are .
Just 11 % advocate gun laws that are less strict .
The practical outcome of the case will be whether the Washington , D.C. , handgun ban will be allowed to stand .
In general , the public opposes sweeping bans on handguns .
In the most recent Gallup Crime Poll , conducted last October , Americans opposed a law that would ban possession of handguns except by police and other authorized persons by 68 % to 30 % .
Implications
The Second Amendment case may well be the most significant Supreme Court ruling this year and arguably the most significant one in Court history on gun ownership .
Reports suggest the Court was sympathetic to the notion that the Second Amendment does confer a right to own guns on Americans during the oral arguments in the case , in line with what most Americans think .
While the Supreme Court is not supposed to be swayed by public opinion , Americans appear inclined to react favorably to a ruling that affirms the right to own guns and unfavorably to one that does not .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,016 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 8 - 10 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 373 gun owners , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±6 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 630 gun non-owners , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Two aides to Mrs. Clinton said yesterday that while she once supported Arkansas 's parental notification law , she now preferred New York 's approach .
New York is one of more than a dozen states that do not have a parental notification requirement ; instead , health care providers have to give information about medical options and risks to patients , including those seeking abortions .
Under the parental notification laws of Arkansas and other states , minors must involve at least one parent in the decision or else receive permission from a judge to obtain an abortion on their own .
" Parental notification is something that we are particularly concerned about in New York State , " said Carla M. Goldstein , a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of New York City , which works with and helps finance Family Planning Advocates .
" Reporters and the general public really need to understand the dangers of parental notification .
Judicial bypass can end up creating a much later - stage pregnancy . "
Ms. Goldstein added , " It can take at least several days for a decision , and it can melt into weeks , and the procedure gets more dangerous , then costs more money , and then it can get even later . "
" We 're really concerned that the Democratic Party , of which Hillary is a leader , has indicated that they may need to soften their stance on protecting women 's reproductive health and freedom , " she added .
Asked if Mrs. Clinton still supported state parental notification laws that include the judicial bypass option , a spokeswoman , Jennifer Hanley , said : " This is too sensitive and important of an issue to make it as black and white as yes or no .
The senator believes that New York is the model .
In states where it is the only option , then yes , she supports parental notification with judicial bypass . "
Some abortion rights advocates expressed other concerns yesterday .
Barbara de Leeuw , a Family Planning Advocates board member , praised Mrs. Clinton 's speech overall but said she was " a little disappointed " that the senator did not speak more about " abstinence plus , " a term for sexual education programs that provide both abstinence counseling and health - conscious advice for sexually active people .
In a find that sheds light on how Earth - like planets may form , astronomers have reported finding the first evidence of small , sandy particles orbiting a newborn solar system at about the same distance as the Earth orbits the sun .
" Precisely how and when planets form is an open question , " said study co-author Christopher Johns - Krull , assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University .
" We believe the disk - shaped clouds of dust around newly formed stars condense , forming microscopic grains of sand that eventually go on to become pebbles , boulders and whole planets . "
In previous studies , astronomers have used infrared heat signals to identify microscopic dust particles around distant stars , but the method is n't precise enough to tell astronomers just how big they become , and whether the particles orbit near the star , like the Earth does the sun , or much further away at a distance more akin to Jupiter or Saturn .
In the new study , Johns - Krull and co-authors in the United States , Germany and Uzbekistan used reflected light from the sand itself to confirm the Earth - like orbit of grainy particles around a pair of stars called KH - 15D in the constellation Monoceros .
The stars are about 2,400 light years from Earth in the Cone Nebula , and they are only about 3 million years old , compared to the sun 's 4.5 billion years .
" We were attracted to this system because it appears bright and dim at different times , which is odd , " Johns - Krull said .
The researchers found that the Earth has a nearly edge - on view of KH - 15D .
From this perspective , the disk blocks one of the stars from view , but its twin has an eccentric orbit that causes it to rise above the disk at regular intervals .
" These eclipses let us study the system with the star there and with the star effectively not there , " Johns - Krull said .
" It 's a very fortuitous arrangement because when the star is there all the time , it 's so bright that we can't see the sand . "
The team conducted both photometric and spectrographic analyses of data collected during the past 12 years from a dozen observatories , including the McDonald Observatory in west Texas , the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the VLT on Mount Paranal in Chile .
" Because of how the light is being reflected there are opportunities to make observations about the chemical composition of these sand - like particles , " said co-author William Herbst , an astronomer at Wesleyan University in Middletown , Conn .
" That 's very exciting because it opens up so many doors for new type of research on this disk . "
The report is to be published online by the journal Nature .
Co-authors include Catrina Hamilton of Dickinson College ; Katherine LeDuc of Wesleyan University ; Joshua Winn of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; Reinhard Mundt of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg , Germany ; and Mansur Ibrahimov of the Ulugh Beg Astronomical Institute in Tashkent , Uzbekistan .
The research was funded by NASA and the Keck Foundation .

Arnie 's First Acts
Show Cheney / Shultz Ownership by EIR Staff California 's newly - elected Hitler , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has made it immediately clear that his Recall election was a project of Vice President Dick Cheney 's , Warren Buffett's , and Bush Administration power broker George Shultz 's electricity - merchant conglomerates who bankrupted the state with deregulation in 2000 - 2002 , then blamed the bankruptcy on Gov. Gray Davis to force Schwarzenegger 's seizure of power .
Schwarzenegger told an Oct. 11 press conference that he would introduce legislation to complete the deregulation of electricity transmission as well as generation as one of his most urgent priorities .
Lyndon LaRouche 's California campaign had exposed that this step was planned at a May 2001 meeting Schwarzenegger had with Enron 's disgraced chief thief , Kenneth Lay , and other electricity speculators a meeting the " Beast - Man " denied and then " could n't recall " during the campaign .
But on election , Schwarzenegger immediately posted a " Ken Lay 's dream " energy plan on his website , promising to stop public financing of needed new power plants , and eliminate any public oversight over future California energy supply contracts .
In the same few days , Schwarzenegger ordered both the California trade unions , and the state legislature to accept drastic cuts in spending and living standards ; and he has appeared to trigger a strike wave which has spread quickly among both public and private employee unions in southern California since his election .
While Presidential candidate LaRouche , now in Europe , has continued to organize an international alert against the fascist threat of " another imported Austrian head of state , " the Cheney - led neo-conservatives in the United States are already pushing the new - Hitler Schwarzenegger for President .
Press Lord Conrad Black 's right - wing Hudson Institute , and Rupert Murdoch 's Weekly Standard have started invoking the 1912 " Bull Moose " candidacy of Theodore Roosevelt , for Schwarzenegger ; the Weekly Standard 's Oct. 14 issue raised the demand , " Remove the constitutional requirement that an American President must be native - born . "
Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah at the same time floated a proposed constitutional amendment to do so ; the Washington Post backed the outrageous move .
The LaRouche Youth Factor in California But LaRouche had vowed on Oct. 9 to make the imposition of Schwarzenegger on California a " Pyrrhic victory " for Cheney and Shultz ; it is swinging Democratic activists and leaders to LaRouche for his effective mobilization in California , and helping his drive to get Cheney ousted from the Bush Administration .
The " on the ground " story of the Recall , is the message to Democrats in California and nationally that an extraordinary mobilization by the LaRouche Youth Movement ( LYM ) in the Los Angeles area , turned a foregone - conclusion 60 - 40 % vote to recall Governor Davis in Los Angeles County , into a final 51 - 49 % defeat of the Recall ( see story , page 70 ) .
A similar LYM mobilization in San Francisco and Oakland made an already anti-Recall public sentiment into an 80 - 20 % landslide there .
The dramatic activation of both college students and trade unions in the Los Angeles area by the LYM was key in this victory .
The state 's press and the national media largely ignored what the LYM was doing with hundreds of thousands of LaRouche 's Who Robbed California ?
pamphlets and " Beast - Man " leaflets , but they did it anyway , making these victories a clear proof of the power of ideas in a crisis , against the media - manipulated rage of a population buffetted by economic collapse .
Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman Eric Bauman told an Oct. 13 meeting of the Party organization that his report " might shock you , but the people who did the best work for us were with the LaRouche Youth Movement . "
He referenced some details of the way the LYM mobilized , and concluded to general applause from the Democrats present that given the Party 's limitations there , " the LaRouche movement was crucial for the battle in L.A. County . "
The waves of that " shock " to the Party at the success of LaRouche 's personal mobilization in California against the Recall , are spreading beyond the state .
The candidate said on Oct. 15  when new Federal Election Commission filings showed him still second among all Democratic candidates in number of contributors that President Bush 's personal trip out to embrace the new Hitler of California might help make LaRouche the next President .
Figures of the Democratic Party 's national leadership including former President Bill Clinton , and LaRouche 's rivals for the Presidential nomination , made cameo appearances at Governor Davis ' side , but never engaged in the Recall battle .
And through Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe , Al Gore and others , they conveyed pressure on Davis not to attack the Cheney cabal and not to discuss the national economy collapse .
In effect , the Democratic leadership other than LaRouche helped Cheney , Shultz , and Buffett unleash a new " Hitler project " on California , and the nation .
It was LaRouche who first identified the Recall , and the Schwarzenegger candidacy it spawned , as a " dirty coup " run by Halliburton 's Cheney , in collaboration with his piratical brothers - in - greed - and - looting , such as Bechtel 's Shultz , and multi-billionaire energy and stock speculator Buffett , to reopen California to further theft by the energy cartels , of which Buffett controls important parts .
Cartels like Enron , backed by Cheney through the White House Energy Task Force , stole more than $ 70 billion through illegally jacked - up prices of energy - supply contracts made possible by deregulation of electricity .
This triggered a process of devolution to state bankruptcy , a $ 38.2 billion hole in the budget which was then blamed on incumbent Governor Davis .
And LaRouche had insisted that if the Schwarzenegger " beast - man " project of these cartels succeeded , they would use Schwarzenegger to loot the state 's economy of many billions more as confirmed in spades by Arnold 's immediate announcement for total energy deregulationeven as the Cheney Republicans nationally used their new " beast - man " to shape a national fascist thrust for the 2004 election .
Open Door for Looters
In addition to his push for deregulation , Schwarzenegger made it clear that he will proceed with Wall Street 's plan to loot every last penny which can be found in California .
His transition teamminus a couple of token Democrats like Oakland mayor Willie Brown , who acknowledge they will have little say in his Administration consists of a " Who 's Who " of academic free - trade fanatics , and Chamber of Commerce Babbitts , who are enthusing about how Arnold will " restore a pro-business climate " in the state , by " cutting the fat out of the budget , " and breaking the back of the labor movement .
The transition team is headed by George Shultz of Bechtel , the Hoover Institution , and the University of Chicago .
Shultz , along with Cheney , was responsible , during the 2000 election year , for recruiting into the Bush transition team and the current Bush Administration , the " Vulcans , " that gang of Straussian liars who gave us the Iraq debacle and the ongoing economic destruction of the American job market and labor force .
Schwarzenegger campaign chairman , now transition team organizer Rep. David Dreier ( R - Calif . ) is principally a representative of the leading West Coast institution tied to fascist philosopher Leo Strauss , the Claremont College / Claremont Institute complex .
Dreier was a principal sponsor of NAFTA and wants similar " total free trade " deals to cover the entire globe .
Transition team member Eloise Anderson is also from the Claremont Institute .
Others on the team are associated with the ultra - free trade , ultra - right wing Mont Pelerin Society ; or , like Hollywood mogul Ivan Reitman who produced Schwarzenegger films , they represent the casino / entertainment interests of Las Vegas and Los Angeles which poured millions into Schwarzenegger 's Recall campaign through the Warren Buffett - owned National City Bank .
Kathleen Shanahan , who worked for Cheney , is considered the front - runner to be Schwarzenegger 's chief of staff .
Another key player emerging is " budget specialist " Donna Arduin , on loan by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , to find the " fat " in the budget .
Arduin is properly credited with wrecking Florida 's education system .
Morgan Stanley investment banker Arduin has been in the state budget - slashing business for Michigan Gov. John Engler , New York 's George Pataki , and Florida 's Jeb Bush .
Under Jeb Bush , Arduin pushed mindless extreme cuts in state education funding , driving class sizes up towards 40 students .
Her mayhem led to a Florida constitutional amendment imposing an upper limit on public school class sizes .
Schwarzenegger has hired her to do a line - by - line budget investigation in preparation for drastic cuts .
With the " beast - man " coming in , management in California has become bolder in attacking unions , which Schwarzenegger blasted as a " special interest " during his campaign .
There is a strike wave hitting Los Angeles , with 70,000 grocery - store workers , and 2,500 members of the Transit Union on strike , protesting efforts to slash their health - care and pension benefits .
How do we engage more youth in science ?
You might say that this is a “ good question ” – and that ’s precisely the key .
We need to leverage children ’s natural propensity to ask questions .
Most young children are born scientists , often frustrating their parents and teachers with a deluge of questions , perpetually asking “ but why ? ”
For some reason , though , a child ’s desire to explore often wanes with age .
Only a select few retain their curiosity and grow up to make world - changing breakthroughs in science .
Science is as much , if not more , about asking questions as it is about getting the right answers .
In fact , asking good questions is at the very heart of the scientific method itself – as chemist Barry Sharpless put it in his Nobel acceptance speech , the scientific method is “ the game of 20 questions played in the language of science ” .
And yet , the way in which science is usually taught in schools focuses entirely on the answers , often quelling children ’s natural curiosity .
Teachers and schools , of course , give priority to answers for practical reasons : students are being prepared to take multiple - choice tests and college entrance exams .

If you look at the work of scientists who have won a Nobel prize , it quickly becomes clear that great scientific work begins with the posing of a great question .
So it occurred to me and my colleagues at the Molecular Frontiers Foundation that perhaps a prestigious award for children – a sort of Nobel prize for kids – would go far in nurturing their inquisitiveness .
For the past 18 months , we have been developing the Molecular Frontiers Inquiry Prize .
Starting this May , the prize will be awarded annually to an equal number of girls and boys from around the world for posing the most penetrating and insightful questions related to molecular science , which encompasses everything from physics and chemistry to physiology and medicine .
The questions will be judged by a panel of eminent scientists , including several Nobel laureates , and selected winners will be invited to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm to mingle with top scientists .
My hope is that the scientists who will serve as mentors and judges will not only gain insights into what the next generation is thinking about , but will also be nudged towards their own scientific breakthroughs as a result of interacting with inquisitive children ’s minds – a thus - far untapped resource in the scientific process .
Over the last century , science and technology have progressed at breakneck speed , spawning ethical , moral , and political dilemmas from nuclear power and global warming , to the bioethics of cloning and genetically modified foods .
If it was ever crucial for the average citizen to possess an inquisitive mind , it is now .
We need to cultivate a culture of uninhibited inquiry – a culture that will inspire young people and affect how they will act as adults .
I believe that if children are taught to value their investigative skills , they will be less likely to blindly accept the statements of advertisers , politicians and religious leaders , ultimately presenting a harder target for fundamentalist ideologies .
So , if you are under 18 , ask a question at www.MoleClues.org by 7 May 2008 .
And , if you are a parent or teacher , go ahead and tell your children that they could possibly win a prize for asking that classic question : “ But why ? ”
A British mining company is at the centre of a row over uranium mining near the Grand Canyon , the great American landmark which is one of the world 's most celebrated preserved areas .
US environmentalists have launched a legal challenge to permission given to the British firm Vane Minerals to drill for uranium in the Kaibab National Forest in Arizona , which borders the canyon on both north and south sides .
Last December the US Forest Service gave Vane , which is based in London but operates largely in America , the authority to drill exploration sites within the forest at several different locations .

The company is seeking commercial quantities of the radioactive element , whose price has soared in the past five years driven by the prospects of a new generation of nuclear power stations being constructed , especially in China .
Commodity speculation is thought to have pushed up the price , which has risen from around $ 7 per pound in 2000 , to more than $ 100 per pound today .
Uranium therefore looks a very attractive option to mining companies , and Vane is hoping to make millions of dollars from the " pipes " or seams of the mineral it is trying to pinpoint 2,000 ft below the Arizona sandstone .
The nearest drilling site is three miles from the Grand Canyon , a spokeswoman for Vane said .
However , a powerful coalition of American environmentalists takes the view that to be doing this so close to the canyon , which sits inside its own national park , is entirely inappropriate , and is acting to stop it .
The Centre for Biological Diversity , the Sierra Club and the Grand Canyon Trust have filed a joint suit in the US District Court in Prescott , Arizona , claiming the government approved drilling without full environmental reviews and in so doing violated several environmental and other laws .
" Grand Canyon simply is n't the place for uranium development , " said Taylor McKinnon of the Centre for Biological Diversity .
" Our national treasures deserve better than the calamity of an adjacent industrial zone . "
The suit claims the Forest Service violated the National Environmental Policy Act and others when it approved exploration using the least rigorous analysis available to the agency .
This analysis , the environmentalists say , failed to consider the controversy attending uranium development , the significance of its proximity to the Grand Canyon , and the cumulative impacts of four other future uranium exploration projects and the potential opening of Denison Corporation 's Canyon Mine – all located in the same area .
Fuelled by the fifteen - fold price increase in uranium during the past eight years , planned development has increased enormously on federal lands immediately south of the canyon .
The boom provoked a unanimous resolution from the Coconino County Board of Supervisors earlier in the year opposing uranium development around the Grand Canyon – the Vane exploration specifically – and supporting congressional efforts to protect the area from development .
" Some places should be off - limits to noise , heavy - equipment traffic , drilling and potential contamination from uranium exploration and drilling , " said Dave Gowdey , from the Grand Canyon Trust .
The court action follows a letter from the same groups outlining legal problems with the approval and requesting that the Forest Service withdraw it .
A spokeswoman for the Kaibab National Forest said it had followed the rules in allowing the exploration .
The Vane spokeswoman said it had gone through all the correct procedures .
At any site where uranium was mined , the area would be restored to its original states , she said .
Concerns about the Grand Canyon 's environmental health are being aired in a new film narrated by Robert Redford – as reported in yesterday 's Independent – which highlights threats to the Colorado river at the canyon 's base .
Ancient and spectacular
The Grand Canyon is a colossal gorge , 277 miles long , up to 18 miles wide and more than a mile deep , cut through the rocky plateau of northern Arizona by the Colorado river .
It is not the world 's deepest canyon , but it is the most visually spectacular , with unparalleled panoramas from the rim , and an enormous sequence of ancient rocks exposed which record much of North America 's geological history .
Until recently it was believed that the river carved out the canyon over a period of six million years .
However , a study by American geologists published earlier this month in the journal Science suggested that the western half of the canyon is actually much older , and that here it took the Colorado river much longer – 17 million years – to cut its way down to the level where it flows today .
The eastern half is believed to have developed separately , and it was six million years ago that the two were joined by the action of the river .
Vietnam is one of the world 's biggest rice exporters
Vietnam has become the latest rice - producing nation to limit exports of the grain against a backdrop of soaring global prices and demand .
Vietnam , the world 's second - biggest rice exporter , said it would cut exports by 22 % this year , following similar moves by India and Egypt .
Analysts said the Vietnam government wanted to stabilise domestic prices .
Global rice prices have soared by 50 % in the past two months raising supply concerns across Asia .
Thailand is the world 's largest rice exporter .
China subsidies
While rice prices have risen primarily because of increasing demand from population growth , they have also been lifted by poor recent crops in Vietnam .
Neighbouring Cambodia has also recently introduced limits on rice exports .
China is the world 's biggest rice producer , but almost all of its crop is kept for the domestic market .
With the world 's largest population to feed , Beijing keeps rice prices subsidised .
It said on Friday that it would now pay farmers more for both rice and wheat in an attempt to boost crop production and cool surging inflation .
Intrigue : Novak suggests GOP operative behind Spitzer fall John Byrne
Published : Monday March 17 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Was a political operative behind the fall of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer ?
That 's the suggestion in a Sunday column by conservative columnist Robert Novak .
A Republican operative , he 's found , predicted the governor 's fall specifically -- several months in advance .
" Republican political operative Roger Stone , Eliot Spitzer 's longtime antagonist , predicted his political demise more than three months in advance , " Novak writes .
" Spitzer 's entrapment by federal authorities investigating a prostitution ring raised speculation that Stone , with a 40 - year record as a political hit man , somehow was behind it . "
" Eliot Spitzer will not serve out his term as governor of the state of New York , '' Stone said Dec. 6 on Michael Smerconish 's radio talk show , " Novak added .
" He gave no details . "
Novak 's post was titled " GOP strategists at work . "
In an interview last week , Stone cheered the governor 's demise , and hinted further that he'd known about the governor 's fall .
" I did n't make him go to a prostitution ring , " Stone told a Newsday columnist Mar. 12 .
" He did that all on his own . "
Asked whether he had a hand in Spitzer 's woes , Stone said , " No comment . "
" I will say I knew it was coming , " he added .
" That 's why I was n't too upset about the results of the special election , " where a Democrat won control of a formerly Republican seat in the State Senate , where the Republicans have a one - vote margin .
Speaking of the scandal Stone added cryptically : " My work is n't done there .
Just watch . "
Stone now runs an anti-Clinton political 527 group , Citizens United Not Timid , the acronym of which has sparked fury among liberal groups .
Alan Dershowitz , writing last week in the Wall Street Journal , averred that the story of Spitzer 's ' capture ' does n't entirely ring true to career prosecutors .
" There is no hard evidence that Eliot Spitzer was targeted for investigation , but the story of how he was caught does not ring entirely true to many experienced former prosecutors and current criminal lawyers , " Dershowitz wrote .
" The New York Times reported that the revelations began with a routine tax inquiry by revenue agents ' conducting a routine examination of suspicious financial transactions reported to them by banks . '
This investigation allegedly found ' several unusual movements of cash involving the Governor of New York . '
But the movement of the amounts of cash required to pay prostitutes , even high - priced prostitutes over a long period of time , does not commonly generate a full - scale investigation . "
" We are talking about thousands , not millions , of dollars .
We are also talking about a man who is a multimillionaire with numerous investments and purchases , " he added .
" The idea that federal investigators would focus on a few transactions to corporations -- that were not themselves under investigation -- raises as many questions as answers . "

There will be a new contest at the Defcon hacker conference this August , one that antivirus vendors already hate .
Called Race - to - Zero , the contest will invite Defcon hackers to find new ways of beating antivirus software .
Contestants will get some sample virus code that they must modify and try to sneak past the antivirus products .
Awards will be given for " Most elegant obfuscation , " " Dirtiest hack of an obfuscation , " " Comedy value " and " Most deserving of beer , " contest organizers say .
The contest was announced Friday .
Security vendors began panning it immediately , saying it will simply help the bad guys learn some new tricks .
" It will do more harm than good , " said Paul Ferguson , a researcher with antivirus vendor TrendMicro .
" Responsible disclosure is one thing , but now actually encouraging people to do this as a contest is a little over the top . "
Some compared the contest to a controversial 2006 Consumer Reports review of antivirus software .
In that article , the magazine created 5,500 new virus samples , based on existing malware , and was roundly criticized by antivirus vendors for contributing to the rapidly expanding list of known malware .
Security companies are already having a hard time keeping up with the torrent of new malware .
With antivirus vendors already processing some 30,000 samples each day , there 's no need for any more samples , said Roger Thompson , chief research officer with antivirus vendor AVG Technologies .
" It 's hard to see an upside for encouraging people to write more viruses , " he said via instant message .
" It 's a dumb idea . "
Contest organizers say that they 're trying to help computer users understand just how much effort is required to skirt antivirus products .
" The point behind the contest is to illustrate that antivirus alone is not a complete defense against malware , " said one of the contest 's organizers , who identified himself only as " Rich , " in an e-mail message .
The Race - to - Zero sponsors hope to present the contest results during Defcon , Rich said .
The contest is not organized by Defcon , but is one of the unofficial events that the show 's organizers have encouraged attendees to arrange .
Defcon runs Aug. 8 to Aug. 10 at the Riviera Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas .

STUDY FINDS WOMEN WHO DRINK
WAY MORE FUN TO STUDY
Researchers Say Alcohol Affects Women's Blood Pressure , Researchers ' Interest
Cambridge , Mass . ( SatireWire.com ) Update —
According to a new study on female alcohol use and blood pressure , young women who consume two or three alcoholic drinks a week are much more fun to do research on than women who do not consume alcohol .
This woman reduced her risk of high blood pressure , and increased her interest among researchers , just by consuming a few drinks .
Oh , and the report also found that women who have a few drinks each week are less likely to develop high blood pressure .
Whatever .
The report , published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , studied drinking patterns and blood pressure among 70,000 nurses between the ages of 25 and 42 .
Dr. Eric Shinauer , who headed the study for Harvard 's School of Public Health , put the findings in perspective .
" Alcohol , 70,000 nurses , and us , " he said .
" Is that cool or what ? "
Shinauer and his colleagues — Dr. Andrew Sporata and Dr. Chandra Palava — conceded their initial grant was to study salt consumption .
However , upon reflection , the trio decided that adjusting the parameters would dramatically heighten their interest in the research .
Explained Palava : " What it came down to was , did we want to say , ' Here young lady , have some salt and let 's see what happens , ' or , ' Here young lady , have a drink and let 's see what happens . ' "
" We 're scientists , but we 're not dead , " he added .
In fact , Shinauer theorized there would be much more interest in studying women 's health issues if alcohol were involved .
Reaction to his study seems to bear this out , as already , several leading universities say they will attempt to verify the group 's findings .
At Stanford University , epidemiologist Bruce Cawthorn said his department is very interested in testing Shinauer 's conclusion that women who have more than 10 alcoholic drinks a week increase their risk of developing high blood pressure by 30 percent .
But more importantly , he added , his staff is " totally stoked " by the concomitant finding that these same women were also , statistically speaking , a blast .
Shinauer , however , insisted their most valuable conclusion was that researchers could do variations on this type of study for years .
" We could do how alcohol affects blood pressure among female flight attendants , or how alcohol affects blood pressure among female strippers .
We are so golden . "
Palava , meanwhile , said he is working on " the Holy Grail " for this area of study — a report on how drinking among young women affects drinking among young women .
" We just have to figure out some statistically significant reason for doing it , " he said .
Palava bristled , however , at the suggestion that researchers should also study the effect of alcohol on young men .
" Jesus , we 're not gay , " he said .

Industry Minister Jim Prentice paid a visit to the University of Calgary on Friday to give a lecture at the law school on policy making .
In the question and answer period that followed , the majority of questions focused on copyright ( Part One , Part Two ) [ update : The Distant Librarian has posted a video of the full talk and Q&A period ] .
Prentice 's responses provide five important insights :
First , despite the enormous opposition to a Canadian DMCA , Prentice continues to rely on a communication strategy based on tired claims about the WIPO Internet treaties and how copyright is a " framework " law in Canada .
A Canadian DMCA will face opposition from consumer groups , education groups , creator groups , and business groups .
Prentice is going to have come up with a much better communication strategy to justify a one - sided copyright law .
Second , Prentice will respond to concerns about the lack of consultation by claiming that there has been extensive consultation , pointing to the 2001 public consultation and several Parliamentary committee reports .
This claim does not withstand even mild scrutiny .
The 2001 consultation is seven years old – a lifetime ago from an Internet perspective .
Indeed , many of today 's younger , new voters were only 11 years old at the time of that consultation ( they were only six years old when the WIPO Treaties were concluded ) .
As for the committee reports , to my knowledge the Industry Committee has never held a hearing focused exclusively on the WIPO Internet treaties , though it has cited the issue in a pair of reports .
The Canadian Heritage Committee did devote one day to exclusively consider the WIPO Internet treaties in March 2004 .
The sole witness ?
Canadian Recording Industry Association General Counsel Richard Pfohl ( WIPO was also part of the discussion in a further hearing in April 2004 ) .
Third , Prentice clearly intends to ignore the Conservative government 's commitment to hold a House of Commons debate on the WIPO Internet treaties before introducing copyright legislation .
Prentice now claims that there are three steps involved – signing a treaty , changing domestic law , and then ratification .
He argues that the Conservative commitment will be met by holding the debate at step three .
This is a complete re-write of the policy that his cabinet colleague , Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier , announced two weeks ago .
That policy was clear that the House of Commons debate comes before the introduction of new legislation .
In fact , it speaks of delaying legislation for 21 sitting days and points with approval to the UK and Australia where the treaty debate unquestionably comes before the changes to domestic law .
Fourth , when confronted with the concerns of many groups about the absence of their issue from the new bill , Prentice will claim that he can't do it all in one bill and that there is a need for " ongoing dialogue . "
This will not be good enough – the Industry Minister cannot simply say that the concerns of education , the concerns of consumers , the concerns of creators , the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner , and the concerns of business should take a back seat to the concerns of the U.S. government .
Fifth , in addressing questions posed by students , professors , and librarians ( each are questioners in the video ) , he characterizes fair dealing as the " consumer side " of copyright policy that is a " challenging area that requires discussion . "
Sorry Mr. Minister – fair dealing is a core concern for students , professors , and librarians not because of their consumer property rights but because this issue goes to the heart of Canadian education and research .
If you do not understand that , you do not understand the concerns with Canadian copyright reform .
Thousands of Canadian students are not looking further discussion – they 're looking for actual support in the legislation .
If it 's not there , Prentice , Prime Minister Harper , and the Conservative Copyright MPs are likely to face more than just polite questions from many concerned constituents .

The Myth of Verified Voting : How GOP strategists and Jack Abramoff transformed America 's elections and the election reform movement itself
K Street Lobbyists and Election Reform
In 1995 , House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Republican strategist Grover Norquist launched the " K Street Project . "
( i ) Named for the Capital Hill street housing many lobbying firms , the Project gave lobbyists direct access to Washington lawmakers through weekly policy and strategy meetings .
The most infamous K Street lobbyist was Jack Abramoff , who worked for the firm Greenberg Traurig .
Abramoff , now in prison , took money from his American Indian tribe clients , and laundered it to Congressional Representatives in return for legislative and policy favors aligned with the Project 's political agenda .
But this was not just any money laundering enterprise .
Abramoff 's dry cleaner was converting money to election fraud .
In 2002 , the New Hampshire GOP received three $ 5,000 checks , just in time to pay $ 15,600 to a telemarketing company that jammed the phone lines of the Democratic Party 's get - out - the - vote campaign in the morning hours of the election .
The three $ 5,000 checks ?
One each from two separate Abramoff tribal clients and the third from K Street loyalist Tom DeLay 's ARMPAC . ( ii )
The phone jamming trick , contributing to GOP Senator Sununu 's narrow win , shows the magical rabbits that can pop out of a hat when Capital Hill lobbyists focus their attention on elections .
In its heyday , the K Street Project held election " reform " dead center in its crosshairs .
Project activities like New Hampshire 's phone jamming , Ohio's " Coingate " and Tom Delay 's Texas " PAC - gate " , spun lobbyist money into election fraud gold .
K Street masterfully laundered funds to influence election campaigns , policies , and processes around the nation .
The Project functioned as one big money - laundering - for - election - fraud apparatus .
K Street 's most influential project was the 2002 sweeping election reform known as the " Help America Vote Act " ( HAVA ) , whose architect , former Congressman Bob Ney , is also now in federal prison .
( iii ) HAVA was brilliantly subversive , spinning money into a sparkling , rich , complex and intricate golden gateway to perpetual election fraud .
HAVA 's most benign outcome was to feed billions of dollars to an unsavory e-voting industry , including Greenberg Traurig 's client , Diebold Election Systems . ( iv )
Its most insidious and dangerous outcome was the creation of the myth of verified voting and the Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) , a White House agency with unprecedented power over the nation 's elections .
Election 2000 – Election Reform 2002
In the aftermath of Election 2000 , the Supreme Court 's Bush v. Gore decision ( v ) dealt one terrible blow after another to our nation 's democracy .
The subversion of the democratic process that began with this decision continued with HAVA and its agency of perpetual subversion : the EAC . ( vi )
In 2002 , the K Street - influenced Congress passed HAVA with great theatrical fanfare .
The American people , still reeling from Election 2000 , received it with a wholesale willingness to suspend disbelief .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
In the wake of damaging lawsuits charging Yahoo Inc. with complicity in the jailing and torture of Chinese dissidents , the company is seeking to make amends with a " human - rights fund " dedicated to providing victims of government censorship with legal and other assistance .
Human - rights groups that once criticized Yahoo for complying with Chinese authorities ' efforts to clamp down on political discourse are now praising its new , public stance on the issue .
Nevertheless ,
Yahoo's YHOO effort raises questions about its future in a country where companies are expected to avoid open conflict with government policies .
Those questions also could conceivably apply to Microsoft Corp. MSFT , - 1.04 % in the future , should it succeed in acquiring Yahoo .
Harry
Wu , a former political prisoner and human - rights advocate once deported by the Chinese government , has been charged with overseeing Yahoo 's initiative .
Wu said a board of roughly five members should be in place to start administering the fund by the end of this month .
" So far it 's unique ; there are no other big companies who have set up big funds , " he commented .
Both Yahoo and Wu declined to detail the fund 's initial size , though Wu said the company has the option to add to it if deemed necessary .
“ Falling afoul of the Chinese government has long been considered a dicey proposition for companies hoping to do business there . ”
Other groups including Reporters Without Borders , an organization that earlier this week helped disrupt the Beijing Olympics flame - lighting ceremony in Greece in protest against China , have been tapped to advise on Yahoo 's fund , according to Wu .
In addition , Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang indicated in a letter sent last month to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that bolder moves may be in store .
Yang wrote that he looks forward to " seizing the opportunity presented by the Olympics to redouble our efforts in securing the release of political dissidents . "
The Beijing Olympics are scheduled to begin in August .
Falling afoul of the Chinese government has long been considered a dicey proposition for companies hoping to do business there .
Yahoo sold its direct presence in China in 2005 , but retains a 39 % stake in Alibaba Group , a Hong Kong - based holding company for a number of promising Chinese ventures including online - auction and payment services .
Yang also serves on the board of directors at Alibaba .
A Yahoo spokeswoman recently said " we do n't do business in China . "
Yet the company 's assets there are widely seen as a valuable potential beachhead in a market with a rapidly growing Internet audience .
" I 'm sure if Yahoo did something loud enough , Alibaba would hear about it , " said Cowen & Co. analyst Jim Friedland .
" But I think Yahoo's once or twice removed enough that it wo n't cause problems for them . "
Alibaba spokesman Porter Erisman declined to comment .
Even though Yahoo enjoys a buffer from the day - to - day operation of its China assets , it 's still likely hoping to see them flourish in an evolving market , said Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen .
Yahoo , like other U.S. Internet firms eyeing the Chinese market , is banking on positive change , Pyykkonen added .
" There 's a bet that all these companies are making that eventually these things get loosened up , and my sense is that it 's part of the equation here .
It certainly is an important market long term , for all the obvious factors . "
Research firm BDA China Ltd. reported earlier this month that China recently surpassed the United States in total Internet users , citing statistics from the China Internet Network Information Center .
Adding up the pieces
Yahoo wisely has established a presence in China that relies on strong local partners , rather than having a direct role , Pyykkonen said .
Such an arrangement is likely coveted by other U.S. companies such as Microsoft MSFT , - 1.04 % , which made an unsolicited acquisition offer for Yahoo in February initially valued at $ 44.6 billion .
Recent published reports , however , suggest that Alibaba intends to buy out Yahoo's stake if it is ultimately acquired by Microsoft .
Whether Microsoft would even see a need to follow through on Yang 's commitment to its new Chinese human - rights fund remains to be seen .
A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment .
“ Whether Microsoft would even see a need to follow through on the new Chinese human - rights fund remains to be seen . ”
" China is a tough country to navigate , " Cowen & Co. 's Friedland said .
Google Inc. GOOG , +0.32 % , for example , was compelled by the Chinese government in 2006 to begin limiting its local search results after it allowed access to topics including the massacre of Tiananmen Square protesters in 1989 .
Google has a direct presence in China , where it struggles to compete against market leader Baidu.com Inc. BIDU , - 2.74 %
Alibaba , on the other hand , is composed of a smattering of assets including online - commerce company Alibaba.com Ltd.
Because it 's publicly traded , Alibaba.com ALBCF is easy to value .
But other , closely held parts of the Alibaba Group , including online - shopping site Taobao.com and online - payment service Alipay.com , make the math a bit murkier , Friedland added .
Overall , the analyst estimated that Yahoo's stake in Alibaba constitutes roughly $ 3.42 a share in value .
Yahoo shares , bolstered by Microsoft 's acquisition bid , have been trading between roughly $ 25 and $ 29 a share in recent weeks .
While the smaller aspects of Alibaba may not be big money - makers , their value is based on potential , Friedland said .
" They 're very well positioned .
They give Yahoo a pretty meaningful stake in the growth of the Internet in China . "
Alongside its commercial potential , the Chinese Internet is also developing as a means for political discussion -- a phenomenon likely to receive more scrutiny as the Beijing Olympics approach , and equally as likely to draw censorship from the government .
China 's bureaucrats made their mark as recently as last week , when local access reportedly was blocked to videos of violent political riots in Tibet .
Those clips had been posted to YouTube , the popular video - sharing service owned by Google GOOG , +0.32 % .
Wu , who serves as executive director of the Washington , D.C. - based Laogai Research Foundation , said that any U.S. Internet company doing business in China has the duty to take an active interest in political conditions there .
" If they get money from China , they have to consider human rights , " he commented .
The Yahoo Human Rights
Fund will be used specifically to " help the people that relate to Yahoo cases or other Internet cases in China , " Wu added , by paying for legal fees and other compensation .
Wu recalled that while he was serving as a representative for two Chinese dissidents , Yang approached him last year with the idea for the fund .
The dissidents had been detained for posting messages to pro-democracy Web sites using their Yahoo accounts , and eventually sued the company in California for handing information over to the Chinese government .
“ ' Yahoo got to this point kicking and screaming , to be sure . ' ” — Morton Sklar , attorney
That case drew the attention of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee , which summoned Yang to a humiliating public hearing focused on the company 's ethical shortcomings .
See related story .
More recently , a second suit was filed in California earlier this month by Chinese political activists alleging that Yahoo helped the government track their activities online , leading to the arrest of Li Zhi -- who is described in court filings as a member of the " China Democracy Party . "
See related story .
Kirk Donahoe , an assistant director at Wu's organization , said that the fund would not be used to aid plaintiffs in the more recent lawsuit .
" We do not provide support to anyone who is involved in a lawsuit against Yahoo , " the spokesman pointed out .
Morton Sklar , an attorney who represented plaintiffs in the original case filed against Yahoo in California last year , said that the fund is sends a positive message to others doing business in China .
" It recognizes that the problem is widespread , " Sklar noted of Yahoo 's fund , adding that " Yahoo got to this point kicking and screaming , to be sure . "
Friedland said he 's glad to see Yahoo take a stance on the issue , rather than simply fighting back with public - relations spin .
" Because they only have a minority stake in [ Alibaba ] , they 're a little more free to be critical ... up to a point . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson resigned Monday , amid multiple ethics investigations and criticism from top lawmakers .
HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson speaks at a news conference in December .
Jackson , who said his resignation would take effect April 18 , did not mention the allegations in his brief statement Monday , saying only he needed to focus on " personal and family matters . "
The resignation came after criticism from members of Congress that Jackson has refused to respond adequately to allegations of impropriety .
President Bush said in a statement , Jackson " made significant progress in transforming public housing , revitalizing and modernizing the Federal Housing Administration , increasing affordable housing , rebuilding the Gulf Coast , decreasing homelessness , and increasing minority homeownership . "
Watch Jackson talk about his career at HUD »
Sen . Chris Dodd , D - Connecticut , who recently called for Jackson to resign , welcomed his decision to step down .
" I hope this change in personnel will be matched by a change in policy that brings real solutions to the housing crisis that has triggered this economic recession , " Dodd said .
No names have been floated as candidates to replace Jackson , a long - time friend of President Bush from their days in Texas .
One possibility would be to promote from within the department , given the short time remaining in the president 's term and the hostility he faces from the Democratic - controlled Senate , which must confirm Jackson 's replacement .
Dodd and Sen. Patty Murray , D - Washington , demanded Jackson 's resignation 10 days ago , saying the ethics allegations have distracted from the secretary 's ability to handle the nation 's housing crisis .
" Secretary Jackson has repeatedly demonstrated that he is not in the position to provide the type of leadership that is necessary during these trying and difficult times , " Dodd said in the statement .
He said an inspector - general 's report recently stated that Jackson had advised staffers to " take political affiliation into account in awarding contacts , " and " serious allegations about his impropriety " are under investigation in three cases , although Dodd did not name them .
Dodd is chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs .
Murray is chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation , Housing and Urban Development .
Jackson has recently been accused in a lawsuit of retaliating against housing officials in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , for blocking a land deal with one of Jackson 's friends .
The FBI has been investigating allegations that Jackson steered a federal contract to a golfing buddy based in South Carolina .
The secretary has denied wrongdoing and White House officials have said for months that the president still has confidence in Jackson .
No charges have been filed against him .
Jackson has been a key player in the Bush administration 's efforts to handle the national housing and mortgage crisis .
Before coming to Washington , Jackson ran Dallas ' housing authority for seven years and then led a Texas power company .
He also was head of the Federal Housing Administration .
His announcement of his resignation comes four years to the day after he was confirmed as secretary .
Speaking to reporters at HUD headquarters in Washington on Monday , Jackson said he had devoted his career to improving housing opportunities .
" As the son of a lead smelter and nurse midwife , and the last of 12 children , never did I imagine I would serve America in such a way , " Jackson said about his Cabinet post .
" I am truly grateful for the opportunity . "
" We have helped families keep their homes , we have transformed public housing , we have reduced chronic homelessness , and we have preserved affordable housing and increased minority homeownership , " he said .
A Jackson adviser told CNN earlier that the secretary has been privately talking about resigning since late last year because he 's grown weary over multiple ethics investigations and allegations that he cannot focus full time on the nation 's housing crisis .

BORDEAUX , France ( Reuters ) -
The mayor of a village in southwest France has threatened residents with severe punishment if they die , because there is no room left in the overcrowded cemetery to bury them .
In an ordinance posted in the council offices , Mayor Gerard Lalanne told the 260 residents of the village of Sarpourenx that “ all persons not having a plot in the cemetery and wishing to be buried in Sarpourenx are forbidden from dying in the parish . ”
It added : “ Offenders will be severely punished . ”
The mayor said he was forced to take drastic action after an administrative court in the nearby town of Pau ruled in January that the acquisition of adjoining private land to extend the cemetery would not be justified .
Lalanne , who celebrated his 70th birthday on Wednesday and is standing for election to a seventh term in this month ’s local elections , said he was sorry that there had not been a positive outcome to the dilemma .
“ It may be a laughing matter for some , but not for me , ” he said .
Fewer than half of American teenagers who were asked basic history and literature questions in a phone survey knew when the Civil War was fought , and one in four said Columbus sailed to the New World some time after 1750 , not in 1492 .
The survey results , released on Tuesday , demonstrate that a significant proportion of teenagers live in “ stunning ignorance ” of history and literature , said the group that commissioned it , Common Core .
The organization describes itself as a new research and advocacy organization that will press for more teaching of the liberal arts in public schools .
The group says President Bush ’s education law , No Child Left Behind , has impoverished public school curriculums by holding schools accountable for student scores on annual tests in reading and mathematics , but in no other subjects .

Fadlallah long has been considered a leader of the most radical faction of Shiite Muslims in Lebanon .
He endorsed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ’s Islamic Revolution in Iran and was accused of ordering , or at least encouraging , the 1983 bombings of the U.S. Marine barracks here , a charge he and his supporters have denied .
He issued fatwas , or religious edicts , calling on the faithful to resist the United States , and urged Muslims to boycott American products .
But the 72 - year - old cleric , who agreed to an interview recently in his South Beirut compound , has toned down his rhetoric in recent years .
Instead , he espouses a more modest vision for the faithful than the ambitious agenda set forth by Iran , which considers itself the patron of Shiites worldwide and has been trying to increase its influence throughout the Muslim world .

“ I do n’t see there is a unity in the situation of Shiites in the world , ” he said .
He leaned forward , his piercing brown eyes becoming animated as he discussed religion , politics and international affairs .
“ I think the current Iranian president lacks diplomatic skills , and I think he creates problems for Iran , ” he said of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Fadlallah , whose black turban identifies him as a descendant of the prophet Muhammad , focuses on daily bread - and - butter issues of concern to his followers .
Such as parenting .
“ One of the general principles in raising children is that parents should not consider their child as part of their possessions , ” he wrote in a ruling translated and placed on the English section of his website , english.bayynat.org.lb .
“ Instead , they should consider him God ’s trust that Allah . . . has put in their hands .
This is done by loving the child , listening to him and respecting his mind . ”

Grand ayatollahs , the highest - ranked clerics in the Shiite hierarchy , have the right to interpret primary religious texts and serve as marja , or source of emulation , for their millions of followers in countries with large Shiite populations such as Lebanon , Iraq , Iran , Pakistan , India and Bahrain .
Most search for a niche .
Khomeini espoused a highly politicized version of Islam ; Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani in Iraq advocates piety , modesty and good deeds .
Fadlallah ’s fatwas and statements seem more like daytime talk show fodder .
“ Sistani is very popular in the Shiite world , but he ’s not involved in the daily lives of Shiites , ” said Fadlallah ’s aide , Hani Abdullah .
“ This is why Fadlallah is more of a reference for modern Shiites . ”
On gender issues in particular , he takes positions that raise eyebrows among his conservative counterparts , such as questioning the conventional Islamic prohibition on female judges and challenging the traditional view that a woman ’s place is in the house and the man ’s in the workplace .

“ The belief that it is disgraceful for the man to manage household tasks is derived from the social culture and not from Islam , ” he says in a statement on his website .
“ Personally , I think that no woman would be obliged to bring her social life to a standstill just because she is being occupied with her children . ”
Also from his website : “ Knowledge is a merit for man and woman equally , and the importance of acquiring it is identical to both of them . ”
A statement from Fadlallah ’s office said he opposed a man “ using any sort of violence against a woman , even in the form of insults and harsh words . ”
He also has addressed issues such as cloning and plastic surgery .

“ Mostly his fatwas are on the side of modernity and progress , ” said Fawwaz Traboulsi , a Lebanese historian and journalist .
“ He ’s very influential , and he ’s got a lot of money . ”
His most liberal rulings and attempts to distance Lebanese Shiites from Iran ’s policies have angered some Shiite clerics close to the Islamic militant group Hezbollah and its leader , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah .
Fadlallah was once Hezbollah ’s spiritual leader , but now the two camps compete for donations from wealthy Shiites , who traditionally have given more money to him .
“ There ’s a real rivalry with Nasrallah , who has become both a military and religious leader , ” Traboulsi said .
“ Many conservative Hezbollah clerics are reacting against Fadlallah ’s rulings . ”
Fadlallah appears to have eased his anti-American stances , even though he and others suspect U.S. operatives were behind an attempt on his life in 1985 , apparently as retaliation in the belief that he had ordered the Marine barracks attack .
The massive car bomb near his home killed more than 80 people in an apartment block , but he was unhurt .

He is critical of the Bush administration but takes pains to underscore that he ’s not anti-American .
He recently answered a question about astronomy and Ramadan posed by a U.S. Marine , a decision criticized by other clerics .
He was among the first religious leaders in the Middle East to condemn the Sept. 11 attacks .
But Fadlallah remains a staunch critic of Israel , once describing the Jewish state as “ a conglomerate of people who come from all parts of the world to live in Palestine on the ruins of another people . ”

Around 189,000 people were informers the secret police of the GDR 's communist regime , when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 -- that 's according to Thuringia 's state office for researching East Germany 's Stasi on Monday , March 10 .
Previously , the number of Stasi informers in 1989 had been estimated at 174,000 .
The complete report , by historian Helmut Mueller - Enberg , is to be published on Thursday .
The Stasi relied heavily on ordinary people to report activity that deviated from the official political ideology in the country of 16 million .
According to Mueller - Enberg , 620,000 people worked undercover for the Stasi in both East and West Germany during the 51 years of the communist state 's existence .
Around 12,000 of them were West Germans .
In East Germany , one in 20 communist party members was a Stasi spy .
According to the report , political ideals served as the primary motivation for people to turn in their neighbors , friends and acquaintances to the secret police .
Financial incentives played only a minor role and blackmail was rare .

The George W. Bush administration has long pushed the " laptop documents "  1,000 pages of technical documents supposedly from a stolen Iranian laptop  as hard evidence of Iranian intentions to build a nuclear weapon .
Now charges based on those documents pose the only remaining obstacles to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) declaring that Iran has resolved all unanswered questions about its nuclear program .
But those documents have long been regarded with great suspicion by US and foreign analysts .
German officials have identified the source of the laptop documents in November 2004 as the Mujahideen e Khalq ( MEK ) , which along with its political arm , the National Council of Resistance in Iran ( NCRI ) , is listed by the US State Department as a terrorist organization .
There are some indications , moreover , that the MEK obtained the documents not from an Iranian source but from Israel ’s Mossad .
In its latest report on Iran , circulated Feb. 22 , the IAEA , under strong pressure from the Bush administration , included descriptions of plans for a facility to produce " green salt , " technical specifications for high explosives testing and the schematic layout of a missile reentry vehicle that appears capable of holding a nuclear weapon .
Iran has been asked to provide full explanations for these alleged activities .
Tehran has denounced the documents on which the charges are based as fabrications provided by the MEK , and has demanded copies of the documents to analyze , but the United States had refused to do so .
The Iranian assertion is supported by statements by German officials .
A few days after then - Secretary of State Colin Powell announced the laptop documents , Karsten Voight , the coordinator for German - American relations in the German Foreign Ministry , was reported by the Wall Street Journal Nov. 22 , 2004 as saying that the information had been provided by " an Iranian dissident group . "
A German official familiar with the issue confirmed to this writer that the NCRI had been the source of the laptop documents .
" I can assure you that the documents came from the Iranian resistance organization . , " the source said .
The Germans have been deeply involved in intelligence collection and analysis regarding the Iranian nuclear program .
According to a story by Washington Post reporter Dafna Linzer soon after the laptop documents were first mentioned publicly by Powell in late 2004 , US officials said they had been stolen from an Iranian whom German intelligence had been trying to recruit , and had been given to intelligence officials of an unnamed country in Turkey .
The German account of the origins of the laptop documents contradicts the insistence by unnamed US intelligence officials who insisted to journalists William J. Broad and David Sanger in November 2005 that the laptop documents did not come from any Iranian resistance groups .
Despite the fact that it was listed as a terrorist organization . , the MEK was a favorite of neoconservatives in the Pentagon , who were proposing in 2003 - 2004 to use it as part of a policy to destabilize Iran .
The United States is known to have used intelligence from the MEK on Iranian military questions for years .
It was considered a credible source of intelligence on the Iranian nuclear program .
after 2002 , mainly because of its identification of the facility in Natanz as a nuclear site .
The German source said he did not know whether the documents were authentic or not .
However , CIA analysts , and European and IAEA officials who were given access to the laptop documents in 2005 were very skeptical about their authenticity .
The Guardian ‘s Julian Borger last February quoted an IAEA official as saying there is " doubt over the provenance of the computer . "
A senior European diplomat who had examined the documents was quoted by the New York Times in November 2005 as saying , " I can fabricate that data .
It looks beautiful , but is open to doubt . "
Scott Ritter , the former US military intelligence officer who was chief United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 , noted in an interview that the CIA has the capability test the authenticity of laptop documents through forensic tests that would reveal when different versions of different documents were created .
The fact that the agency could not rule out the possibility of fabrication , according to Ritter , indicates that it had either chosen not to do such tests or that the tests had revealed fraud .
Despite its having been credited with the Natanz intelligence coup in 2002 , the overall record of the MEK on the Iranian nuclear program has been very poor .
The CIA continued to submit intelligence from the Iranian group about alleged Iranian nuclear weapons - related work to the IAEA over the next five years , without identifying the source .
But that intelligence turned out to be unreliable .
A senior IAEA official told the Los Angeles Times in February 2007 that , since 2002 , " pretty much all the intelligence that has come to us has proved to be wrong . "
Former State Department deputy intelligence director for the Near East and South Asia Wayne White doubts that the MEK has actually had the contacts within the Iranian bureaucracy and scientific community necessary to come up with intelligence such as Natanz and the laptop documents .
" I find it very hard to believe that supporters of the MEK have n’t been thoroughly rooted out of the Iranian bureaucracy , " says White .
" I think they are without key sources in the Iranian government . "
In her February 2006 report on the laptop documents , the Post ‘s Linzer said CIA analysts had originally speculated that a " third country , such as Israel , had fabricated the evidence . "
They eventually " discounted that theory , " she wrote , without explaining why .
Since 2002 , new information has emerged indicating that the MEK did not obtain the 2002 data on Natanz itself but received it from the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad .
Yossi Melman and Meier Javadanfar , who co-authored a book on the Iranian nuclear program last year , write that they were told by " very senior Israeli Intelligence officials " in late 2006 that Israeli intelligence had known about Natanz for a full year before the Iranian group ’s press conference .
They explained that they had chosen not to reveal it to the public " because of safety concerns for the sources that provided the information . "
Shahriar
Ahy , an adviser to monarchist leader Reza Pahlavi , told journalist Connie Bruck that the detailed information on Natanz had not come from MEK but from " a friendly government , and it had come to more than one opposition group , not only the mujahideen . "
Bruck wrote in the New Yorker on Mar. 16 , 2006 that when he was asked if the " friendly government " was Israel , Ahy smiled and said , " The friendly government did not want to be the source of it , publicly .
If the friendly government gives it to the US publicly , then it would be received differently .
Better to come from an opposition group . "
Israel has maintained a relationship with the MEK since the late 1990s , according to Bruck , including assistance to the organization .
in beaming broadcasts by the NCRI from Paris into Iran .
An Israeli diplomat confirmed that Israel had found the MEK " useful , " Bruck reported , but the official declined to elaborate .

Olbermann reveals ' Commander in Chief Threshold Test '

Hillary Clinton 's campaign likes to say -- ad nauseam , to anyone who will listen -- that her opponent Barack Obama has not passed the " commander in chief test , " but what exactly does this endlessly repeated talking point mean ?
MSNBC host Keith Olbermann tried to provide an answer Sunday night , presenting his tongue - in - cheek , 17 - question " Commander in Chief Threshold Test , " during a special anniversary edition of his Countdown aired on NBC .
The " test " poked fun at some of Olbermann 's favorite targets , including former Virginia Sen .
George Allen , Dick Cheney , George W. Bush and John McCain , along with Democrats John Kerry , Michael Dukakis , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
Some sample questions :
Question 10 : " How often should the commander in chief joke about nuclear holocaust ? "
This was accompanied by Ronald Reagan joking during the Cold War that " the bombing starts in five minutes , " and McCain singing " Bomb , Bomb Iran " to the tune of a famous Beach Boys song .
Question 13 : " Are you now or have you ever been confused about who will be your right - hand man when you are commander in chief ? "
President Bush bungled this one in an address , saying " the left - hand knows what the right hand is doing , " while emphasizing " left hand " with his right hand , and vice versa .
This video is from NBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann , broadcast March 30 , 2008 .
Six men on a raft : The Kon -Tiki sailed from Peru to Polynesia in 101 days in 1947 .
AP Photo __1947 : __ Thor Heyerdahl and five crewmen leave Callao , Peru , on a balsa - wood raft .
They 're hoping to prove that ancient South Americans could have sailed to Polynesia .
Heyerdahl was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnologist who crossed the boundaries of academic disciplines and ruffled plenty of feathers in the process .
He theorized that South Americans had visited and traded with Polynesia , not that they were the primary population source .
Scholars derided him and maintained that South American balsa - wood craft would get waterlogged and sink before they could cross the Pacific .
So Heyerdahl built the Kon -Tiki and named it after the pre-Inca sun god .
The 18 - by - 45 - foot deck was made of nine balsa trunks lashed with hemp rope .
A 29 - foot A - frame mast held a 15 - by - 18 - foot mainsail and a topsail .
The raft also had a mizzen sail and a long steering oar at the stern .
A small cabin and some of the deck were made of bamboo .
No metal was used in the construction .
Kon -Tiki had a few concessions to contemporary life : radio , life raft and modern food .
Heyerdahl said the purpose of the voyage was only to test the raft : " We were not making it to prove that we had once been Indians ourselves . "
Huge Pacific swells regularly broke across the raft 's flat surface but did not swamp it .
The journey covered 4,300 nautical miles in 101 days ( averaging 42 ½ miles a day ) .
The raft suffered no real damage until it landed on the reef in the Tuamotu Islands on Aug .
7 .
Heyerdahl wrote a best - selling book that was translated into 65 languages .
The film version of Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award for Best Documentary of 1951 .
Heyerdahl may have proven that ancient mariners could have sailed westward across the Pacific , but he did n't prove that they had done so .
Most scholars conclude that the Polynesian Islands were settled from the west , based on evidence from linguistics , genetics and cultural anthropology .
Still , the Kon-Tiki and Heyerdahl 's subsequent adventures in the Atlantic opened the scholarly and popular imagination to the possibility that some of our ancestors may have made adventurous journeys in many places long before we previously suspected .

The incidence of oral cancer due to a virus transmitted during oral sex has increased steeply over the last 30 years , according to research in the US .
And scientists relate this trend to changes in people ’s sexual behaviour .
The number of tongue , mouth and throat cancers due to the sexually transmitted human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , which can also cause cervical cancer in women , rose by about a third from 1973 to 2004 , say researchers .
The team led by Maura Gillison at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , US , studied trends in oral cancers recorded by US National Cancer Institute registries .
Earlier work by this team and others had established a link between certain strains of the common sexually transmitted virus and oral cancer .
The latest study , which looked at nearly 46,000 cases , is the first to quantify an increase in mouth and throat cancers due to sexual activity .

‘ Vaccinate boys ’
“ What we do know is that the prevalence of HPV is high , particularly among young people and this should n’t be a surprise given that , since the sexual revolution , people have been having more sexual partners , ” says Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK .
The rise was largest among young white males , suggesting this group is more likely to have oral sex at a younger age now than it was 20 years ago , says Gillison ’s team .
It adds that further research on the role of race and sex , and oral sexual behaviour , is needed .
What is not in doubt , says Gillison , is the need to consider giving boys the HPV vaccine , to protect them from the disease .
A Merck vaccine is currently licensed for use in young women and girls to protect them against the most common cervical cancer - causing strains of HPV .
These strains are also thought to cause oral cancer , as well as penile and anal cancer .
“ We need to start having a discussion about those cancers other than cervical cancer that may be affected in a positive way by the vaccine , ” urges Gillison .
Cost concerns
One US campaign group , the Oral Cancer Foundation , is now calling on the US Food and Drug Administration to “ move rapidly to approve the vaccination of young boys with the cervical cancer vaccine , to reduce the pool of HPV16 [ a particularly aggressive strain ] ” and protect them from oral cancer .
Walker says however , given the high cost of such a programme , authorities might require more evidence that such a move really would prevent a significant number of male cancers .
Tonsil and throat cancers affect about two in every 100,000 adults in the US and about half a million people around the world each year .
Although , oral cancers linked to HPV infection have risen , the study notes the incidence of oral cancers in parts of the mouth or throat not linked to HPV infection remained constant until 1982 , and then started to decline .
Gillison says this is probably due to falling consumption of tobacco and alcohol , which are also linked to the cancers .

Evolution has taken another step away from being dismissed as " a theory " in the classroom , thanks to a new article in PLoS Biology .
The research article , by Brian Paegel and Gerald Joyce of The Scripps Research Institute , California , documents the automation of evolution : they have produced a computer - controlled system that can drive the evolution of improved RNA enzymes -- biological catalysts -- without human input .
In the future , this " evolution - machine " could feature in the classroom as well as the lab , allowing students to watch evolution happen in their biology lessons .
The evolution of molecules via scientific experiment is not new .
The first RNA enzymes to be " evolved " in the lab were generated in the 1990s .
But what is exciting about this work is that the process has been made automatic .
Thus evolution is directed by a machine without requiring human intervention - other then providing the initial ingredients and switching the machine on .
As all students of Darwin know , evolution occurs when there is variation in a population ; where some variants confer a survival or reproductive advantage to the individual , and where the basis for this advantage can be inherited .
Finally , there must be a selection pressure - - a reason that not all animals can survive or reproduce -- such as a limited supply of food or a predator that must be avoided .
These are the principles that the Paegel / Joyce system uses .
The system begins with a population of RNA enzymes , which are the individuals that will evolve , and these enzymes vary slightly from each other .
The enzymes are challenged to catalyse a reaction , and those that do catalyse it bind a " promoter " sequence to themselves in the process .
Other enzymes in the machine ( which act like part of the machine , rather than part of the experiment ) cause any RNA enzyme bound to a promoter to be reproduced ; therefore , enzymes that are good at reacting with the substrate become more numerous .
This is analogous to those animals that are most successful being able to reproduce , both of which lead to the advantageous variation becoming more common .
In their system , Paegel and Joyce establish selection by having the evolution - machine reduce the availability of the reactants as time progresses .
Therefore , the only enzymes to be reproduced are those that can bind a promoter when promoters are scarce .
Any random mutation that allows an enzyme to bind a promoter more effectively is beneficial and will come to dominate the final population of enzymes .
Throughout the process , the evolution - machine can propagate the reaction itself , because whenever the enzyme population size reaches a predetermined level , the machine removes a fraction of the population and replaces the starting chemicals needed for the reaction to continue .
By evolving the RNA enzyme according to this selection regime , the evolution - machine generated an enzyme that was better ; it could work quickly with much lower concentrations of reactant then the ancestral enzymes could .
The final enzyme at the end of Paegel and Joyce 's experiment had 11 mutations which together made it 90 times more efficient at using the starting ingredients .
This beautifully illustrates what about evolution is random and what is not .
While the end point is predicted by the selection pressure -- i.e. , the decreasing concentration of ingredients determines that enzymes will evolve to cope with decreased concentration -- the actual mutations that allow this are completely random and cannot be predicted at the outset -- i.e. , if you bought an " evolution machine " and ran the same experiment , your end product would be an enzyme that could cope with low concentrations too , but the mutations that it acquired to do this might be different .

For partnered women , a manly man with no attachments seems sexiest when she is fertile .
Whom do you fancy ?
When in a relationship , women 's preferences change over the course of their menstrual cycle .
GETTY IMAGES
Women beware : instinctive preferences might up the odds of getting pregnant when cheating on a partner .
In a study looking at the ever - interesting ( and ever - mysterious ) question of why women are attracted to certain men , researchers found that sexual interest shifts with a partnered woman ’s menstrual cycle .
When fertile , women in relationships are most attracted to single men ; when infertile their attraction shifts to coupled men1 .
The reason , the researchers suggest , is that coupled women who are thinking of having an affair ( even when asked to think about it by researchers ) subconsciously select a man who is more likely to be a willing partner when they are fertile .
Courting a coupled man may be both a waste of time — as he is less likely to participate in an affair — and hazardous , as there is a greater chance of getting caught .
“ Ancestral women who felt more attracted to a single man than to an already coupled one would have been more likely than others to succeed and transmit this preference to their daughters , ” says Paola Bressan of the University of Padua in Italy .
“ These subconscious preferences are apparently still with us . ”
As for why women in relationships prefer coupled men during their non-fertile stage , Bressan thinks that the women are instinctively assessing these men as potential replacement partners .
“ A coupled man obviously has the skills to maintain a long - term relationship , whereas a single man is an unknown .
Indeed , women tend to be suspicious of men who are still on the mating market , ” Bressan says .
Single women showed no such variation in their preferences ; they habitually showed no regard for whether a man was single or taken when expressing sexual preference , at any point in their cycle .
A man for all seasons
In many monogamous animals , including marmosets and humans , males of high genetic quality are less likely to invest time in paternal care than are those of lower genetic quality .
The theory behind this is that females view males with good genes as so desirable to the quality of their offspring that they are willing to sacrifice help with the rearing , letting the men get away with not being around .
Lower - quality males make up for their poorer genes by being supportive and aiding in child rearing .
Given these realities , one strategy for a female is to develop a long - term relationship with a lower - quality male while secretly breeding with single high - quality males .
The only problem then is getting caught .
Long - term partners will often attack an adulterous female in the animal world .
In humans , the penalties can be equally stiff .
Bressan and colleague Debora Stranieri wondered whether these factors would drive women to be most interested in single men during their window of highest fertility .
Manly men
The team asked more than 200 women , half of whom were single , the other half in relationships , to rate the attractiveness of men in photographs described as single , married , in love , or with a girlfriend .
When the same man was labelled as single rather than being in any kind of attachment , fertile women in relationships scored single men 13 % higher than attached men ; infertile women scored them 8 % lower .
The effect of fertile women ’s preference for single men was most noticeable when those men had particularly ‘ manly ’ features , such as strong jaws , says Bressan .

The findings add to other studies looking at physiological changes and sexual behaviour associated with reproductive hormone cycles in women .
Some work has shown that women are more amorous , for example , when at the fertile stage of their menstrual cycle — similar to the way that animals are ‘ in heat ’ near the fertile stage of their oestrus cycle .
“ These findings provide additional evidence that oestrus in women , long believed to have been lost in human evolution , is alive and well , ” says Eli Finkel , a psychologist at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois .
They also have the alarming implication that adulterous women , instead of trying to avoid getting pregnant , will subconsciously tend to do the opposite .
However , actual romantic behaviour is not the same as instinctive sexual preferences , says Finkel : both need to be intensively studied to better understand all of this .
Many albinos live in fear in Tanzania
Tanzania 's president has ordered a crackdown on witchdoctors who use body parts from albinos in magic potions to bring people good luck or fortune .
" This is senseless cruelty .
It must stop forthwith , " Jakaya Kikwete said on television , AFP news agency reports .
" I am told that people kill albinos and chop their body parts , including fingers , believing they can get rich when mining or fishing , " he said .
The order comes after the murder of 19 albinos in the last year .
The BBC's Vicky Ntetema in Dar es Salaam says there is a widespread belief in Tanzania that the condition is the result of a curse put on the family .
Some people hide the albino members of the family for fear of them either being rejected by the community or killed .
Old women with red eyes have been killed in parts of Tanzania , after being accused of witchcraft , she says .
In the past , Tanzania 's Albino Society ( TAS ) has accused the government of turning a blind eye to the killing of albinos .
There are more than 8,000 registered albinos in Tanzania , although TAS believes there to be 150,000 among the country population of some 35 m .
2008 -05 - 20 : Minor update to get things working with latest Tamarin Tracing code , and updated times for test runs .
Tamarin Tracing can be extended by creating native methods .
These are methods of a class where the implementation is in C rather than JavaScript .
For this example I 'll use a native implementation of the fibonacci function and compare it to the JavaScript version in my previous post .
A JavaScript function that is implemented in C using the ' native ' modifier in the JavaScript source .
For example , a natively implemented ' fib ' function would be declared in JavaScript as :
public native function fib ( n:int ) : int ;
Notice that this includes the type of the arguments and the return type .
This is so the compiler can produce the correct C types in the C stub code it generates .
The native method must be implemented in C and linked into the final executable .
The name of the function is in the following form :
[ class ] _[ visibility ] _[ name ]
In this fib example there is no class , so ' null ' is used for that part of the name and visibility is public so that part of the name is left out .
The end result is a native C function called null_fib needs to be implemented .
As part of the compilation process the compiler generates a C structure that will be accessed by the native implementation to extract the arguments passed to it .
This structure looks like :
struct null_fib_args { public : ScriptObjectp /*global1 */ self ; private : int32_t self_pad ; public : int32_t n ; private : int32_t n_pad ; public : StatusOut * status_out ; } ;
The 'n ' field of the structure is the argument passed from JavaScript callers .
The native implementation , which we need to write , looks like this :
int32_t native_fib ( int32_t n ) { if ( n <= 1 ) return 1 ; else return native_fib( n- 1)+native_fib ( n - 2 ) ; } AVMPLUS_NATIVE_METHOD( int32_t , null_fib ) { return native_fib ( args ->n ) ; }
First there is the native_fib C function that we want to call from JavaScript .
The AVMPLUS_NATIVE_METHOD macro is used to declare the wrapper function that implements the ' native function fib ' we declared in the JavaScript file .
This receives an ' args ' object that is an instance of the null_fib_args C structure mentioned previously .
This is used in our example to extract the passed integer value and call the native C function and return the result .
Native function implementations must be linked into the tamarin tracing executable .
It 's not possible to compile a JavaScript file containing a native declaration and run it using the tamarin tracing ' avmshell ' program .
To integrate the fib code into ' avmshell ' I modify the shell code to compile and link in the native implementation .
We can then write JavaScript code that calls it and run it with ' avmshell ' .
The first thing to do is write the JavaScript side of the ' fib ' code .
In a ' fib.as ' file in the ' shell ' directory of tamarin tracing I have the following code :
package testing { public function fib( n ) { if ( n <= 1 ) return 1 ; else return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) ; } public native function fib2 ( n:int ) : int ; }
This provides a JavaScript implementation of fibonacci and one called ' fib2 ' , intended to be implemented with C code so I can compare the speed .
This file needs to be compiled to abc bytecode and have the args structure generated in a C header file .
There is a script , shell .py , in the ' shell ' subdirectory that does this for the other avmshell classes .
Changing the line following the comment ' compile builtins ' so it includes the ' fib.as ' file just created will result in it being included in the build .
What this line in shell .
py does is compile the JavaScript files using the Flex SDK compiler ( See later about where to get this and where to put it ) .
The command it runs is something like :
java - jar asc.jar - import builtin_full.abc ... fib.as
This produces the abc bytecode for our fibonacci code , as outlined in my previous post .
The next command run by ' shell.py ' is the Flex Global Optimizer .
This takes all the abc bytecode files for the shell , optimizes them , and produces a C header and implementation file .
It is these C files that contain the generated arguments structure , and the implementation file actually contains a C array of the optimized bytecode .
The output of this step will be compiled by a C compiler and linked into the ' avmshell ' executable .
The native C implementation of the ' fib2 ' function should be placed in a file in the ' shell ' subdirectory and that file added to the ' manifest. mk ' makefile .
The contents of this file for this example is :
#include " avmshell.h " # include < stdlib.h > namespace avmplus { int32_t native_fib ( int32_t n ) { if ( n <= 1 ) return 1 ; else return native_fib( n- 1)+native_fib ( n - 2 ) ; } AVMPLUS_NATIVE_METHOD( int32_t , null_fib2 ) { return native_fib ( args ->n ) ; } }
I called this ' fibimpl.cpp ' and added it to manifest.mk .
You 'll see in the ' shell ' subdirectory various implementations of native methods in [ foo ]
Class.cpp files , where [ foo ] is the JavaScript class being implemented .
There are also [ foo ] .
as files which have the JavaScript side of the implementation .
To build our new ' avmshell ' which is able to call our native fibonacci implementation , run ' shell.py ' , and do the configure and make steps as outlined previously :
$ mkdir mybuild $ cd mybuild $ ../ tamarin - tracing / configure -- enable - shell $ make
I wrote two simple test files to test the ' fib ' and ' fib2 ' functions :
$ cat fib .as import testing .*; print ( " fib 30 = " + fib ( 30 ) ) ; $ cat fib2.as import testing .*; print ( " fib 30 = " + fib2 ( 30 ) ) ;
Here are some simple timings on my machine with the tracing jit enabled and disabled :
$ time ./ shell / avmshell fib.abc fib 30 = 1346269 real 0m0.417s user 0m0.384s sys 0m0.020s $ time ./ shell / avmshell fib2.abc fib 30 = 1346269 real 0m0.092s user 0m0.060s sys 0m0.020s $ time ./ shell / avmshell - interp fib.abc fib 30 = 1346269 real 0m7.496s user 0m7.448s sys 0m0.004s $ time ./ shell / avmshell - interp fib2.abc fib 30 = 1346269 real 0m0.070s user 0m0.060s sys 0m0.004s
Another way of extending tamarin tracing is via forth .
I 'll cover that in a later post .
I mentioned earlier about needing the Flex ActionScript compiler and global optimizer from their asc.jar file .
Unfortunately tamarin tracing needs a bleeding edge version of this to generate the correct C code .
A recent version can be obtained from Mozilla public ftp .
This should be placed in the ' utils ' subdirectory to be picked up by the scripts .
Even more unfortunately this version is out of date for the latest mercurial repository code .
Hopefully this situation will be rectified soon , but in the meantime you can go back to changeset 302 from the mercurial repository .
I tested the current asc.jar against that .
There are some interesting things from the Tamarin summit about the generated arguments structure .
You 'll notice it has some padding fields in it .
When the native implementation function is called from Forth , the layout of the Forth stack looks like ( in Forth stack format ) :
( obj arg1 ... argn status -- )
Each value on the Forth stack is a 64 bit value .
The generated structure type exactly matches the Forth stack layout .
This means that when the Forth stack is ready for the native call , the argument object is actually a pointer to a location on the stack .
There is no intermediate argument object actually allocated .
The padding fields are to enable exactly matching up with the items on the stack .
Interestingly , if I recall correctly from the Tamarin summit , calling native methods from the tracing jit is actually less efficient than calling it from the interpreter .
This is because the interpreter uses the stack layout trick for the arguments object above .
But for the tracing jit the argument values are often stored in registers or other memory locations .
These must be copied into an arguments object and then the native function called .
This is a slight overhead .
Please feel free to leave a comment or email me if you have any questions or corrections to the above .
It represents my understanding from attending the summit and playing with the code and may not necessarily be the best way of doing things , or may be incorrect in places .
Sony A200 Review
Review Date : March 27th 2008

Leave a comment about this Review
Introduction
A surprise announcement back at the CES show in January , the A200 is Sony 's second entry - level DSLR camera .
The Sony A200 follows on from the A100 , apparently one of the best - selling DSLR's of 2007 , and it also forms the basis for two more advanced models , the A300 and A350 , which were unveiled a month later at the PMA show .
The A200 is now the cheapest Sony DSLR , building on the success of the A100 by using a smaller and lighter body , improving auto - focus performance ( thanks to technology borrowed from the A700 ) , increasing ISO speeds up to 3200 , and featuring a slightly larger 2.7 inch LCD screen .
There 's also an optional vertical grip for portraits , something which the A100 sorely missed , and the flash now pops - up automatically .
The A200 retains the 10 megapixel sensor , anti-dust system , anti-shake system that 's built into the body , eye - start auto - focus system and Dynamic Range Optimiser of its predecessor .
So with three new DSLRs , the beginning of 2008 may come to be seen as a pivotal moment for Sony .
Mark Goldstein found out if the A200 is a good start to the year ...

The Sony A200 attempts to build on the success of the popular A100 model and take a bigger slice of the entry - level DSLR market by tweaking the overall design , rather than radically altering it .
Sony may have shocked industry watchers with its wholesale buy out of Konica Minolta at the start of 2006 � in order to play catch up and quickly narrow the gap � but it obviously saw something of value and that latter company 's innovations sensibly have n't been forgotten .
The A200 visibly pays respect to Konica Minolta 's heritage , still resembling the Dynax / Maxxum 5D in looks and features , and perhaps most importantly by keeping the Minolta A - type lens mount ( now of course the Alpha mount ) it 's cleverly afforded compatibility with a wealth of existing lenses .
The Sony A200 is slightly smaller and lighter than the A100 , but it 's still quite a big camera when compared to its main rivals , the Canon EOS 450D and Nikon D60 .
On its own the Sony A200 body weighs over 500g and measures 130.8 x 98.5 x 71.3 mm , rather dwarfing the standard 18 - 70 mm f/3.5- 5.6 kit lens , which feels a little lightweight and out - of - place in this company .
Build quality is very good , with a chunky plastic body that is well - suited to two - handed operation , unlike some of the more diminutive DSLRs that we 've seen recently .
The A200's design is dominated by the very deep , chunky rubberised handgrip , and the large 2.7 inch LCD screen on the rear .
There is a pronounced curve / indentation to the back of the body , allowing a comfortable resting position for the thumb when gripping the camera , while the indentations on the rubberized front of the grip � which houses both card ( at the side ) and chunky info lithium NP - FM55H battery ( at the base ) � means that it wo n't easily slip from your grasp in the heat of the action .
As with the older A100 , the Sony A200 has inherited a number of core Konica Minolta technologies .
In addition to the aforementioned lens mount that boasts day one compatibility with 28 years worth of existing lenses , Konica Minolta 's pioneering Anti Shake technology , whereby optical image stabilisation is built into the camera body itself rather than the lens , has also been adopted .
Here it 's called Super SteadyShot , and it does much the same thing : adjusting for external hand - wobble by counter - moving the CCD in a compensating manner .
I found during the review period that it 's quite effective , resulting in more usable shots in low light conditions without flash than I thought possible , and giving the 2.5 shutter speed steps advantage that the marketing literature promises .
Sony 's system does offer a large advantage over the likes of Nikon and Canon , in that because it 's built - into the camera body , it works with any lens that you attach to the camera , removing the need to buy more expensive lenses with anti-shake .
Finally , at the point of powering down , the A200's sensor vibrates to automatically shake off any dust that has found its way in when changing lenses or zooming in and out .
As a further line of defence , the CMOS sensor 's filter sports an anti-static coating .
In the short term the anti-dust combo appears to work well , with a few very small particles of dust only visible at very small apertures .
In spite of the Anti-Dust Technology , you 'll still need to invest in some kind of third - party sensor cleaning solution to keep the image sensor completely free of unwanted dust , but it does keep the majority of dust off the sensor .
Pop -up Flash Main Menu
The Sony A200 is quite complex in terms of the number of external controls that it has , with over 20 in total .
The majority of the controls are clearly labeled and common to most cameras .
There 's a mode dial on the top - left of the camera that lets you quickly select the various shooting and scene modes .
Also found on top of the camera are the Drive continuous shooting / bracketing button , very handy ISO button , and the shutter button , which is quite loud compared with other DSLRs and may deter some from using it for candids , but at least its definitive sound confirms for the less experienced user that the shot has actually been taken .
The A200 can shoot in continuous mode at a fairly respectable maximum of three frames per second , and the number of continuous sequential shots possible is limited only by the available memory when shooting Standard or Fine JPEG .
When using RAW mode , the A200 maintains 3 fps for up to 6 images .
The Drive button also allows exposure bracketing of +/- 0.3 EV or +/- 0.7EV , shooting three images with a single press of the shutter .
It also takes three bracketed images for white balance .
Notable by its absence is any kind of LCD panel on top of the camera to show what the current settings are , which is always useful .
Instead you have to rely on the information displayed in the optical viewfinder or the more comprehensive information shown by default on the LCD screen .
Finally , the pop -up flash housing now opens automatically when a flash mode is selected , and there 's also an external flashgun hotshoe which includes a slip off plastic cover .
The Clear Photo LCD screen is a large 2.7 inch model with an adequate resolution of 230,000 pixels , a fairly wide viewing angle and visibility that is n't compromised by bright sun .
Inset above the LCD is the equally bright and clear optical pentaprism viewfinder , surrounded by a spongy rubber eyepiece and with a small dioptric adjustment control ranged top right .
The viewfinder displays standard shooting information along the bottom , with a central grid that illuminates in red which of the 9 point AF areas are being utilized .
Beneath the viewfinder is a sensor that pre-focuses a shot as you bring your eye up to it ( called Eye Start AF ) ; a real boon for the happy snapper brigade , although you can turn this off if you do n't get on with it .
The new 9 point autofocus system , using technology borrowed from the prosumer A700 model , is noticeably faster and more accurate than the A100 .
The AF / MF button on the front of the camera lets you switch between auto and manual focusing .
Logically placed to the left of the optical viewfinder on the camera back is the Off / On switch .
Flick it to on with your eye already to the viewfinder and you 're ready to take the first shot in less than a second .
Arranged in a vertical row immediately below are four buttons for bringing up the camera 's menu folders on screen ; activating , switching off or changing the view of the display settings ; the last two being the self explanatory trash can and playback buttons .
On the opposite side of the main LCD screen is a responsive four - way control pad for tabbing through and affecting change to settings or images .
Above the navigation pad to the right of the viewfinder are the Exposure Compensation and Auto - Exposure Lock buttons , the latter locking the exposure in capture mode .
Rear Controls Top Controls
Just below is the Function button , which provides quick access to most of the principal creative controls via the LCD screen .
Press it once and the screen switches to Quick Navigation mode , allowing you to use the pad to move around and change the various settings shown on the LCD ( Flash Mode , Metering Mode , Autofocus Mode , AF Area , White Balance and D - Range Optimiser ) .
Although not as refined as the A700 , it 's still an excellent system that works really well , almost making up for the lack of a top LCD information screen .
You can still access all of these options from the main menu system or a dedicated button too .
The Function button also doubles up as the button that rotates captured landscapes to portrait ratio and vice versa .
Tilt the camera on its side and the shooting info on the LCD automatically rotates through 90 � with you .
If the A200 is set to Manual shooting mode , the control dial near the shutter button controls the shutter speed , with aperture set by holding down the exposure compensation button and then using the same control dial .
In aperture - and shutter - priority modes , the front dial can be used to set the aperture and shutter speed respectively .
Completing the rear controls is the large Super SteadyShot on / off switch , located below the navigation pad , which like the main power switch requires a reassuringly firm flick of the thumb , meaning that accidental activation or deactivation is n't a problem .
On the left - hand side of the camera body sits a large rubber flap , covering a port for a remote release cable , and a DC - in port for a mains power adaptor .
Unlike the more expensive A700 model , there is no HDMI functionality on this camera .
On the right side is the Compact Flash slot .
As this is a DSLR , no memory card is included with the camera itself .
For the purposes of my review , I was shooting to an 8 GB compact flash card with a mixture of RAW , simultaneous RAW +JPEG and , for sample images , the Fine JPEG mode .
Pleasingly , write speeds for the different file formats appear nigh on instantaneous , meaning that in single shot mode you 're not conscious of the camera processing the first image before you can take the second .
Finally , moving to the bottom of the camera , we find the metal tripod socket , ideally positioned in - line with the middle of the lens mount , and the battery compartment .
The Sony A200 uses a new InfoLITHIUM rechargeable battery pack , which still delivers up to 750 shots between charges , but can additionally display the remaining battery life on the LCD screen as a percentage , so that you always know how much power is left .
Memory Card Slot Battery Compartment
Sony's D - Range ( Dynamic Range )
Optimiser adjusts brightness or contrast across the whole scene and is claimed to be particularly effective for high contrast , backlit scenes .
When shooting in either JPEG or RAW , the Standard mode improves shadow detail using standard gamma curves , with the Advanced mode providing a more exaggerated effect .
Take a look at the Image Quality page for some examples of the various DRO settings .
The main camera menu system on the Sony A200 is accessed by pressing the Menu button on the rear of the camera .
As expected from a Sony digital camera , these are cleanly and logically structured .
There are four main menus , Camera , Custom , Play and Setup .
All of the camera 's main options , such as white balance , image quality , auto - focus mode and ISO speed , can be accessed here , so the Camera menu has 11 options spread over 2 screens , the Custom menu has 6 options , the Play menu 9 and the Setup menu 14 .
Due to the large LCD screen and restricting the number of on - screen choices to 6 , the various options and icons are clear and legible .
If you have never used a digital camera before , or you 're upgrading from a more basic model , reading the easy - to - follow manual before you start is a good idea .
Thankfully
Sony have chosen to supply it in printed format , rather than as a PDF on a CD , so you can also carry it with you .
Once you have captured a photo , the Sony A200 has a fairly good range of options when it comes to playing , reviewing and managing your images .
You can instantly scroll through the images that you have taken , view thumbnails , zoom in and out up to 12 x magnification , view slideshows , delete , protect , rotate an image and set the print order .
The Display button toggles between no information , a simple settings information screen , a Histogram screen showing a combination of brightness and RGB histograms plus small image and key camera settings , and five small thumbnails above the main image .
In summary the Sony A200 is a modest upgrade of an already proven design , significantly adding faster and more accurate auto - focusing , a refined control layout , and a number of other minor improvements .
Find out now if the image quality has also been improved ...

CAIRO ( Reuters ) - New evidence of a sick , deprived population working under harsh conditions contradicts earlier images of wealth and abundance from the art records of the ancient Egyptian city of Tell el - Amarna , a study has found .

Tell el - Amarna was briefly the capital of ancient Egypt during the reign of the pharaoh Akhenaten , who abandoned most of Egypt ’s old gods in favor of the Aten sun disk and brought in a new and more expressive style of art .
Akhenaten , who ruled Egypt between 1379 and 1362 BC , built and lived in Tell el - Amarna in central Egypt for 15 years .
The city was largely abandoned shortly after his death and the ascendance of the famous boy king Tutankhamen to the throne .
Studies on the remains of ordinary ancient Egyptians in a cemetery in Tell el - Amarna showed that many of them suffered from anemia , fractured bones , stunted growth and high juvenile mortality rates , according to professors Barry Kemp and Gerome Rose , who led the research .
Rose , a professor of anthropology in the University of Arkansas in the United States , said adults buried in the cemetery were probably brought there from other parts of Egypt .
“ This means that we have a period of deprivation in Egypt prior to the Amarna phase , ” he told an audience of archaeologists and Egyptologists in Cairo on Thursday evening .
“ So maybe things were not so good for the average Egyptian and maybe Akhenaten said we have to change to make things better , ” he said .
Kemp , director of the Amarna Project which seeks in part to increase public knowledge of Tell el - Amarna and surrounding region , said little attention has been given to the cemeteries of ordinary ancient Egyptians .
“ A very large number of ordinary cemeteries have been excavated but just for the objects and very little attention has been paid for the human remain , ” he told Reuters .
“ The idea of treating the human remains ... to study the overall health of the population is relatively new . ”
Paintings in the tombs of the nobles show an abundance of offerings , but the remains of ordinary people tell a different story .
Rose displayed pictures showing spinal injuries among teenagers , probably because of accidents during construction work to build the city .
The study showed that anemia ran at 74 percent among children and teenagers , and at 44 percent among adults , Rose said .
The average height of men was 159 cm ( 5 feet 2 inches ) and 153 cm among women .
“ Adult heights are used as a proxy for overall standard of living , ” he said .
“ Short statures reflect a diet deficient in protein .
...
People were not growing to their full potential . ”
Kemp said he believed further excavations in Tell el - Amarna would “ firm - up ” the conclusions of his team .
“ We are seeing a more realistic picture of what life was like , ” he told Reuters .
“ It has nothing to do with the intentions of Akhenaten , which may have been good and paternal toward his people . ”
The US Government auditor has found plans to build a fighter jet which will be Australia 's main combat aircraft are massively over - budget and face long delays .
The Government Accountability Office says the Joint Strike Fighter project could come in more than $ 40 billion over budget .
Problems in its development could also delay the completion of the planes by more than two years .
The F35 Joint Strike Fighter is planned to become Australia 's main fighter jet from 2014 .
Australia has ordered 100 of the planes at a cost of at least $ 14 billion .
The Joint Strike Fighters are also being sold to Britain , Canada and the Netherlands .
dvtm - dynamic virtual terminal manager
dvtm brings the concept of tiling window management , popularized by X11 - window managers like dwm to the console .
As a console window manager it tries to make it easy to work with multiple console based programs .
News
Download
Either Download the latest source tarball , compile ( you will need curses headers ) and install it
$ EDITOR config.mk && $ EDITOR config.def.h && make && sudo make install
or use one of the distribution provided binary packages .
Why dvtm ?
The philosophy behind
dvtm strives to adhere to the Unix philosophy .
It tries to do one thing , dynamic window management on the console , and to do it well .
As such dvtm does not implement session management but instead delegates this task to a separate tool called abduco .
Similarly dvtm ’s copy mode is implemented by piping the scroll back buffer content to an external editor and only storing whatever the editor writes to stdout .
Hence the selection process is delegated to the editor where powerful features such as regular expression search are available .
As a result dvtm ’s source code is relatively small ( ~4000 lines of C ) , simple and therefore easy to hack on .
Quickstart
All of dvtm keybindings start with a common modifier which from now on is refered to as MOD .
By default MOD is set to CTRL+g however this can be changed at runttime with the -m command line option .
For example setting MOD to CTRL - b is accomplished by starting dvtm -m ^b .
Windows
New windows are created with MOD+c and closed with MOD+x .
To switch among the windows use MOD+j and MOD+k or MOD + [ 1..9 ] where the digit corresponds to the window number which is displayed in the title bar .
Windows can be minimized and restored with MOD +. .
Input can be directed to all visible window by pressing MOD+a , issuing the same key combination again restores normal behaviour i.e. only the currently focused window will receive input .
Layouts
Visible Windows are arranged by a layout .
Each layout consists of a master and a tile area .
Typically the master area occupies the largest part of the screen and is intended for the currently most important window .
The size of the master area can be shrunk with MOD+h and enlarged with MOD -l respectively .
Windows can be zoomed into the master area with MOD + Enter .
The number of windows in the master area can be increased and decreased with MOD+i and MOD+d .
By default dvtm comes with 4 different layouts which can be cycled through via MOD + Space
vertical stack : master area on the left half , other clients stacked on the right
bottom stack : master area on the top half , other clients stacked below
grid : every window gets an equally sized portion of the screen
fullscreen : only the selected window is shown and occupies the whole available display area MOD +m
Further layouts are included in the source tarball but disabled by default .
Tagging
Each window has a non empty set of tags [ 1..n ] associated with it .
A view consists of a number of tags .
The current view includes all windows which are tagged with the currently active tags .
The following key bindings are used to manipulate the tagsets .
MOD - 0 view all windows with any tag
view all windows with any tag Mod-v-Tab toggles to the previously selected tags
toggles to the previously selected tags MOD - v - [ 1..n ] view all windows with nth tag
view all windows with nth tag Mod - V - [ 1..n ] add / remove all windows with nth tag to / from the view
add / remove all windows with nth tag to / from the view Mod -t - [ 1..n ] apply nth tag to focused window
apply nth tag to focused window Mod - T - [ 1..n ] add / remove nth tag to / from focused window
Statusbar
dvtm can be instructed to read and display status messages from a named pipe .
As an example the dvtm- status script is provided which shows the current time .
Copymode
MOD+e pipes the whole scroll buffer content to an external editor .
What ever the editor writes to stdout is remembered by dvtm and can later be pasted with MOD +p .
In order for this to work the editor needs to be usable as a filter and should use stderr for its user interface .
Examples where this is the case include sandy ( 1 ) and vis .
$ echo Hello World | vis - | cat
Patches
There exist a number of out of tree patches which customize dvtm ’s behaviour :
pertag ( see also the corresponding mailing list post )
FAQ
Detach / reattach functionality
dvtm does n’t have session support built in .
Use abduco instead .
$ abduco -c dvtm-session
Detach using CTRL -\ and later reattach with
$ abduco - a dvtm-session
Copy /
Paste does not work under X
If you have mouse support enabled , which is the case with the default settings , you need to hold down shift while selecting and inserting text .
In case you do n’t like this behaviour either run dvtm with the - M command line argument , disable it at run time with MOD+M or modify config .
def.h to disable it completely at compile time .
You will however no longer be able to perform other mouse actions like selecting windows etc .
How to change the key bindings ?
The configuration of dvtm is done by creating a custom config.h and ( re ) compiling the source code .
See the default config .def.h as an example , adapting it to your preference should be straightforward .
You basically define a set of layouts and keys which dvtm will use .
There are some pre defined macros to ease configuration .
WARNING : terminal is not fully functional
This means you have n’t installed the dvtm .
info terminfo description which can be done with tic -s dvtm.info .
If for some reason you ca n’t install new terminfo descriptions set the DVTM_TERM environment variable to a known terminal when starting dvtm as in
$ DVTM_TERM=rxvt dvtm
This will instruct dvtm to use rxvt as $ TERM value within its windows .
How to set the window title ?
The window title can be changed by means of a xterm extension terminal escape sequence
$ echo -ne " \033 ] 0 ; Your title here \007 "
So for example in bash if you want to display the current working directory in the window title this can be accomplished by means of the following section in your startup files .
# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host : dir case " $ TERM " in dvtm * |xterm * |rxvt * )
PROMPT_COMMAND ='echo -ne " \033]0 ; $ {USER}@$ {HOSTNAME} : $ {PWD / $ HOME/~}\007 " ' ;; *) ;; esac
Other shells provide similar functionality , zsh as an example has a precmd function which can be used to achieve the same effect .
Something is wrong with the displayed colors
Make sure you have set $ TERM correctly for example if you want to use 256 color profiles you probably have to append - 256 color to your regular terminal name .
Also due to limitations of ncurses by default you can only use 255 color pairs simultaneously .
If you need more than 255 different color pairs at the same time , then you have to rebuild ncurses with
$ ./ configure ... -- enable-ext-colors
Note that this changes the ABI and therefore sets SONAME of the library to 6 ( i.e. you have to link against libncursesw.so.6 ) .
Some characters are displayed like garbage
Make sure you compiled dvtm against a unicode aware curses library ( in case of ncurses this would be libncursesw ) .
Also make sure that your locale settings contain UTF - 8 .

Wesley Snipes is now awaiting sentencing in Florida
The film star was accused of failing to pay tax on $ 58 m ( £ 29.1 m ) of income from 1999 to 2004 .
Snipes and two co-defendants denied eight charges in one of the US tax service 's biggest ever cases .
He was found guilty on three misdemeanours and could still face up to three years in prison .
Snipes , 45 , and the two co-defendants had been charged with six counts of failing to file tax returns , two of fraudulently claiming tax refunds and one count of conspiracy to defraud the government .
They could have faced up to 16 years in prison .
Lawyers for Snipes had admitted he was " dead wrong " and should have to pay the money back .
But they had insisted there was no fraud and no need for a trial .
Protest
The trial took place in the rural township of Ocala , 130 km ( 80 miles ) north - west of Orlando , Florida , because it was near the celebrity enclave of Isleworth , where prosecutors said Snipes lived at the time of the suspected fraud .
The jury heard how Snipes stopped paying federal income tax in 2000 , and then allegedly sought $ 12 m ( £ 6 m ) in illegal refunds .
They heard he had come to agree with the two other defendants , Eddie Ray Kahn and Douglas P Rosile , two protesters who do not believe the US government has the right to demand income tax on American wages .
The prosecution said Snipes simply wanted to avoid paying tax .
He had sent the government a 600 - page document in which he called himself a " non-taxpayer " .
None of the three defendants called witnesses .
The lawyer for US vice - president Dick Cheney claimed today that the Congress lacks any authority to examine his behaviour on the job .
The exception claimed by Cheney 's counsel came in response to requests from congressional Democrats that David Addington , the vice - president 's chief of staff , testify about his involvement in the approval of interrogation tactics used at Guantanamo Bay .
Ruling out voluntary cooperation by Addington , Cheney lawyer Kathryn Wheelbarger said Cheney 's conduct is " not within the [ congressional ] committee 's power of inquiry " .
" Congress lacks the constitutional power to regulate by law what a vice - president communicates in the performance of the vice president 's official duties , or what a vice president recommends that a president communicate , " Wheelbarger wrote to senior aides on Capitol Hill .
The exception claimed by Cheney 's office recalls his attempt last year to evade rules for classified documents by deeming the vice - president 's office a hybrid branch of government - both executive and legislative .
The Democratic congressman who is investigating the legal framework for the violent interrogation of terrorist suspects , John Conyers , has asked Addington and several other top Bush administration lawyers to testify .
Thus far all have claimed their deliberations are privileged .
However , Philippe Sands QC , law professor at University College , London , has agreed to appear in Washington and discuss the revelations in Torture Team , his new book on the consequences of the brutal tactics used at Guantanamo .
Excerpts from Torture Team were previewed exclusively by the Guardian earlier this month .
Two witnesses sought by Conyers , former US attorney general John Ashcroft and former US justice department lawyer John Yoo , claimed that their involvement in civil lawsuits related to harsh interrogations allows them to avoid appearing before Congress .
In letters to attorneys representing Ashcroft and Yoo , Conyers shot down their arguments and indicated he would pursue subpoenas if their clients did not testify at his May 6 hearing .
" I am aware of no basis for the remarkable claim that pending civil litigation somehow immunises an individual from testifying before Congress , " Conyers wrote .
Conyers , who chairs the House of Representatives judiciary committee , also questioned the reasoning of Cheney 's lawyer in a letter to Addington .
" It is hard to know what aspect of the invitation [ to you ] has given rise to concern that the committee might seek to regulate the vice president 's recommendations to the president , " Conyers wrote .
" Especially since far more obvious potential subjects of legislation are plentiful , " he added , mentioning several : US laws on the use of torture on terrorist suspects , the 15 - year - old War Crimes Act , and the rules that allowed the Bush White House to receive legal advice from a specialised office within the justice department .
Canadian researchers have found antibiotic - resistant Staph bacteria in pork products purchased in retail stores across the country – a discovery that raises questions about how the contamination occurred , how frequently it happens and whether it has implications for human health .
Just under 10 per cent of sampled pork chops and ground pork recently purchased in four provinces tested positive for methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA , lead researcher Dr. Scott Weese reported Wednesday in a presentation to the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases in Atlanta .
The bacteria would be destroyed by proper cooking , so Staph food poisoning is not a major concern , said Weese , an expert on zoonoses , the pathogens that pass back and forth between people and animals .
But he wondered whether people handling meat with MRSA on its surface would end up inadvertently " colonizing " themselves .
People who carry the bacteria on their skin or in their nostrils are at greater risk of going on to develop a Staph infection , which can range from a hard - to - heal boil to pneumonia to a potentially deadly bloodstream infection .
" My main concern is : if there 's MRSA on the surface of a pork chop and someone 's handling it and then they touch their nose , could they transmit it from the pork chop to their nose ? " noted Weese , a veterinarian based at the Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph .
" If they do what they 're supposed to do in terms of meat handling , then it should be perfectly safe .
But do people do that is the question ? "
Where MRSA infections were once mainly acquired in hospital , in recent years increasing rates of infections have been recorded in people who have n't been in hospitals and have n't been taking antibiotics .
The startling rise in so - called community acquired MRSA infections in the United States – a trend which is now being seen in parts of Canada – has led scientists to look for ways to explain the changing pattern of infections .
But Weese said it is too soon to conclude that MRSA in meat might be playing a role .
" It 's way too early to say that it does .
But we have to look at whether it does . "
" Basically my take - home message is I 'm not going to stop eating pork because of this , " he said .
" I 'm going to keep washing my hands and pay attention to how I handle it .
And that 's all I think I need to do . "
This is the first confirmed report of MRSA in retail meat in North America and one of fewer than a handful of such reported findings in the world .
A group of Dutch researchers reported last fall that they had isolated MRSA from two pork samples in the Netherlands .
And Japanese scientists reported in 2005 that they had found MRSA in two samples of raw chicken .
Weese 's team decided to look for MRSA in pork meat after finding the superbug in Ontario pigs , work that was reported last November in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases .
He admitted they currently do n't know how much significance to place on the presence of the bacteria on the meat .
Nor do the testing methods they used allow them to say if the meat was teeming with MRSA , or simply carrying small amounts of the bacteria .
In an interview , he described the research as a step - wise process .
" Step 1 is : Is it in pigs ?
Step 2 : Yes , it 's in food .
Step 3 : ... How much is there ?
Is it one organism or is it a billion ? "
" The techniques we use are fairly sensitive and they do n't quantify .
It 's a Yes - No ( answer ) , " he explained .
" Now we need to refine that and say : OK , how much is there ?
Where is it ?
And in the broad scheme where did it come from and does it actually cause a problem ? "
The meat was purchased through the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance , a Public Health Agency of Canada program that looks for antibiotic resistant bacteria in food and food animals .

To date Weese 's team has tested 212 meat samples bought in four different provinces .
Most were pork chops but the group also tested a few pork shoulder roasts and some ground pork .
None of the pork roasts carried the bacteria but an equal percentage of pork chops and ground pork did .
The rates of positive MRSA tests ranged from zero per cent in one province to 33 per cent in another .
Weese did n't want to name the provinces .
Molecular analysis of about half of the isolated bacteria show a mix of strains .
Some could not be typed , which suggests they are probably MRSA strains known to infect pigs , Weese said .
But of those strains that could be typed , some were of a common human strain while others were of a type known to infect both horses and humans .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Once derided as a white elephant , the U.S. Marine Corps ' tilt - rotor aircraft , the V - 22 Osprey , is proving its mettle in Iraq , military officials said .
An Osprey refuels before a night mission last week in central Iraq .
The Osprey , which takes off and lands like a helicopter but flies like a plane , was designed to replace the Corps ' aging and less - capable helicopter fleet .
But a series of accidents involving the planes left 30 people dead from 1991 to 2000 , and critics said the Osprey never would be able to replace the Vietnam - era CH - 46 Sea Knight , which was the Corps ' airlift workhorse .
The military , which has ordered 360 of the aircraft , said the 10 deployed to Iraq are doing what they are supposed to do -- carrying troops faster , farther and safer than the copters can .
Last September , Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 263 left for Iraq 's western Anbar province on the first deployment of the V - 22 .
Since then , the planes have logged more than 2,000 flight hours , initially doing routine cargo and troop movements from base to base in an area about the size of South Carolina .
In December , commanders gave the planes a more risky mission called " aero - scout " in which a group of V - 22s flies into a relatively unsecured location and drops off Marines for a search mission .
The planes sit on the ground until the Marines load up and then fly off to somewhere else for another mission .

The Osprey 's speed has been a lifesaver , too , squadron officials said .
For instance , they said two V - 22s were dispatched to fly a more than 130 - mile round trip in the remote western desert to pick up a wounded Marine and get him to a hospital .
The planes were able to do so in an hour , something no helicopter in the Marine inventory could do , squadron officials said .
Commanders in Iraq have allowed little media coverage of the V - 22s since their arrival , wanting to get crews used to their mission and to keep insurgents from targeting the planes for propaganda purposes .
The planes have not come under direct fire , officials said .
Critics said the plane is lightly defended , with only one rear - mounted gun .
But Marines said the Osprey has enough power and speed to get out of a hostile zone faster than any helicopter , and the aircraft can fly higher , allowing it to be out of range of shoulder - fired missiles .
The Osprey seems to have become a favorite of commanders who need to get to places quickly , including Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. military commander in Iraq .
Petraeus used one to fly around the country on Christmas Day to visit troops .
" Gen . Petraeus flew in the jump seat and was very impressed by the aircraft 's capabilities , " according to Col .
Steve Boylan , a spokesman for the general .
" The rate of climb is exceptional , and it can fly about twice as fast as a Black Hawk [ helicopter ] , without needing to refuel as frequently , " Boylan said .
" Beyond that , its automatic - hover capability for use in landing in very dusty conditions , even at night , is tremendous . "
Petraeus chose the Osprey for that mission because it was the only aircraft in the inventory that could fly around the country without refueling and not rely on runways , Boylan said .
Despite glowing remarks from troops in Iraq , the planes have an overarching reliability problem , according to critics .
" The Marines will tell you it 's a new plane , and all new aircraft have problems , but it 's not a new plane ; it 's been around for a long time now , " said Philip Coyle , former chief of the Pentagon 's weapons testing division .
" It seems like every time one problem is fixed another one comes along , and I just do n't think the program will be able to get over that . "
Marines contend the planes have performed well , with six to eight aircraft out of 10 available at any one time .
No serious reports of mechanical problems have been reported with the planes in Iraq , according to Marine Corps officials in Washington , and a shortage of spare parts has been alleviated .
Critics such as Coyle said they are n't convinced the planes are the answer for the Marines .
" It has flown more than 2,000 hours in Iraq , but most of that has been carefully coordinated to minimize the risks , " he said .
" The program is like a bad poker hand .
They keep putting money into it when they should have spent it on a new helicopter system . "
The Marine commands in Washington and Iraq said they do not let the critics faze them .
" As with any first - time deployment , new lessons are learned every day , " one Marine deployed with the Osprey squadron said .

More than 20,000 people are forecast to lose their jobs on Wall Street as the credit crunch bites into business at financial institutions over the next two years .
New York 's Independent Budget Office , a non-partisan agency which scrutinises the city 's finances , estimates that profits on Wall Street fell by 80 % during 2007 to $ 3.2bn - the lowest level since 1994 .
In a report published this week , the office predicted that 12,600 job cuts this year , followed by 7,600 in 2009 .
" The economic situation is particularly precarious , " said Ronny Lowenstein , director of the publicly funded agency .
" If the problems affecting Wall Street and housing worsen , the recession will be deeper and the fiscal pressures on the city will quickly mount . "
The figures do not include the likely redundancies at Bear Stearns , which ran into difficulties after the report was compiled .
They pose a potential headache for New York 's public finances because almost 35 % of wages in the city come from the financial sector .
Many leading institutions have already made deep cuts .
Data compiled by Bloomberg News suggests that banks and brokerages have shed 34,000 jobs over the last nine months , the biggest round of layoffs since the dotcom boom ended at the beginning of the decade .
Among the layoffs are 6,200 jobs at Citigroup , 4,990 at Lehman Brothers and 2,940 at Morgan Stanley , all of which have written off billions of dollars related to sub - prime mortgages .
John Challenger , chief executive of the recruitment consultancy Challenger , Gray & Christmas , said those with transferable skills were better placed to find work elsewhere .
" Everybody can figure out how to use an accountant or a salesman of one kind or another .
But an analyst - that 's more difficult .
Those whose specialities are very much tied to Wall Street are having a more difficult time . "
In spite of a downturn across the broader American economy , there are jobs available for administrative and support staff who lose their posts at financial firms .
Those who work in information technology are similarly in demand .
But traders and fund managers , who are used to high earnings , face a tougher market .
" It 's a bleak time on Wall Street .
Nobody can yet see the bottom , see the horizon , to know how long this will last , " Challenger said .
Analysts say Bear Stearns ' demise could add as many as 8,000 of the firm 's 14,000 employees to the jobs toll .

There are a few things in the world that just do n’t make sense to me : Nicholas Cage ’s successful film career .
Vegetarianism .
Crocs .
But if there ’s one thing that completely mystifies me it ’s attempted censorship .
As an artist , I think it offends my very nature .
Anytime that ugly little beast coerces a company to remove any work of art , media , or culture from the collective “ many ” because of the opinion of the narrow - minded , but vocal , “ few ” , I get very angry .
We all have the right to our opinions , but nobody has the right to undermine free speech and promote censorship .
The question , one that I can’t answer even though I ’ve thought about it , is “ Why are some Americans completely incapable of having a sense of humour about their own country ? ”

So here ’s an ad that ran last month in Mexio , created by Teran / TBWA for Absolut Vodka .
The map shows Mexico ’s borders before The American - Mexican war of 1846 - 1848 .
The war started when Mexico had the cojones to not recognize the U.S. annexation of Texas .
It ’s been a sore spot with Mexico ever since , as the transfer of land and re-drawing of borders post - war usually tends to be .
The joke is simple , innocent , and harmless , and was only ever intended to run in Mexico .
No harm , no foul .
That ’s until American media outlets got a hold of it , the ad started to spread across the web , and I ’m sure you can guess what happened next .
People lost their shit .
The Absolut website got a couple thousand complaints , threats of a boycott , and the Neo - Cons foamed at the mouth at the audacity of anyone to ever assume that the world could possibly be a better place is America had less land .
People starting reacting as if Mexico had made a formal declaration of war and was massing troops along the Rio Grande .
The offender takes over a billboard in Mexico City .
Pic courtesy of Kyle Fletcher .
The main point of all this , the one that drives me nuts , is that somewhere along the line everyone managed to forget that this was just an ad .
It ’s not a UN treaty .
It ’s a vodka ad .
Last week , Absolut ’s makers Vin & Spirit said the ad was created “ with a Mexican sensibility ” and was not meant for the U.S. market .
Absolut released an apology saying “ In no way was this meant to offend or disparage , nor does it advocate an altering of borders , nor does it lend support to any anti-American sentiment , nor does it reflect immigration issues . ”
No shit .
That ’s because it ’s an ADVERTISEMENT FOR VODKA .
Just the fact that anyone should have to explain that a print ad is n’t literally suggesting the Mexican annexation of Texas proves how worked up some people are .
Worse than that , the fact that some Americans would react with such vitriol towards Mexico over something so inconsequential illustrates just how intrinsically racist the offended , boycott - happy bunch really are .
Want proof ?
Here are some of the choice comments from the website absolutads.com :
“ How about an ad that shows a mushroom clowd [ sic ] over Mexico and USA people rejoycing [ sic ] that we do n’t have to put up a fence to keep law breakers out .
Thats no worse than you giving half of our country away . ”
“ In an world of Absolut America haters , the USA would n’t exist .
But , where will the Mexicans run to for jobs and indoor plumbing ? ”
“ I know what an intelligent marketing move is : pandering to a bunch of illiterate Mexicans , most of whom are dirt - poor and have no discerning taste anyway , while pissing off millions of savvy Americans , who can , far and away , afford to purchase much more of your product and are more likely to drink it anyway .
Genius ! ”
“ How dare you INSULT The United States just to sell your poison to some hispanics .
I hope you go under from lack of sales . ”
“ The makers of Absolut have crossed the line .
They are now encouraging the overthrow of my country .
Screw them . ”
Who are these people ?
If they put half the energy of their vehemence over this ad and morphed it into , say , working to fight cancer or stopping global warming or saving Darfur , just imagine what they could accomplish .
“ Encouraging the overthrow of my country … ” .
Are you fucking kidding me ?
One particular foamy - mouthed Neo - Con blogger , who I ’m not going to name because a ) I do n’t want to give them any more credit , and b ) I ’m worried they ’ll try and have me killed , went as far as to post this lovely graphic response to the ad , photo - shopped by an equally foamy - mouthed reader :
Wow .
I do n’t know what else to say to that except wow .
I wonder if these people get all chest - beaty when they think about the Statue of Liberty , or does that entire “ give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses … ” concept only get upheld when it ’s convenient ?
Sure , the global opinion of America is at an all time low and maybe they ’re feeling a little deflated , but it ’s still the richest , loudest , shiniest , showiest , most powerful country in the world .
Is n’t that enough to just chill out and let Mexico get a little jab in ?
Do people seriously think that Mexico will have a few vodkas and say “ Gee , that Absolut ad has the right idea … let ’s take our non-existent army and invade California .
That ’ll show those Yanks … ” .
I ’m not trying to paint an inaccurate picture that these few complaints speak for all Americans .
The problem is that these are the type of people that speak up .
This is who Absolut is listening to .
That ’s what bothers me .
I ’m disturbed that the racism of someone who ca n’t correctly spell “ cloud ” is partially determining what kind of advertising the rest of us should see .
No matter the issue , discrimination and hatred is never a valid response .
Thanks to kp for sending me this .
Moments ago , Democrats representing Florida in Congress released this joint statement , effectively putting the kibosh on a mail - in re-do primary :
" We are committed to working with the DNC , the Florida State Democratic party , our Democratic leaders in Florida , and our two candidates to reach an expedited solution that ensures our 210 delegates are seated .
Our House delegation is opposed to a mail - in campaign or any redo of any kind . ”
Even if the candidates agree , there will be no expedited solution unless the courts somehow intervene , which , given a series of federal court rulings last year , is unlikely .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Already in debt and understaffed , the U.S. Forest Service just spent $ 600,000 in purchasing handheld Tasers for every member of its Law Enforcement division .
Near the end of the U.S. Forest Service 's fiscal year in September , there was a hurried single - source purchase of 700 Tasers for the Law Enforcement and Investigations division of the U.S. Forest Service .
The Tasers are now sitting in storage , as there were no rules governing their use or a required training program yet developed by the USFS .
In fact , there was no public input , or congressional review of the purchase .
There was n't even a written explanation as to why the devices were needed .
There was a very brief justification statement that really only described the item for purchase .
Jeff Ruch of the group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ) did request and receive , under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , records relating to the amount the Forest Service paid for the devices ( $ 600,001.52 -- $ 857 apiece ) , and the justification statement , but not any information that described the training that would have to be provided to agency personnel who will use the electronic Tasers .
USFS director John Twiss issued a statement : " In the interest of customer service , we can tell you that the Forest Service is currently developing the required training and law enforcement officers will be required to attend prior to the issuance of , or authorization to carry or use , an Electronic Control Device . "
With the devastating forest fires of the past summer , one would think that director Twiss would have more important matters to address than the purchase of what we now know to be lethal weapons .
The agency is presently a quarter of a billion dollars in debt and has 200 vacant positions , some lost to budget cuts and more to agents who have been reassigned to other obligations such as border patrol for the Department of Homeland Security .
The USFS has over 750,000 million annual visitors and that leaves one officer overseeing approximately 1.5 million visitors and covering 300,000 acres of forest , and even more budget cuts are looming .
PEER , in 2005 , released information on director John Twiss , claiming he is the first person without any law enforcement qualifications or credentials to head the USFS -- he 's a civilian with desk experience and nothing more .
In the early 1990s , Congress mandated that the Forest Service law enforcement division be independent of the agency chain - of - command , in order to ensure fair and independent investigations and internal probes .
But Twiss signaled that he would see an end to such independency , and according to Ruch would see to it , " that all future Forest Service investigations will be politically vetted . "
Lethal Tasers in the hands of untrained federal agents , compounded by the bureaucratic management style of the present director , with the accompanying potential for serious abuse certainly doesnâ€™t bode well for park visitors .
Jeff Ruch of PEER said it best when he opined , " As a result , in addition to the howl of the coyote and the hoot of the owl , the plaintive cry of " Do n't tase me , bro ! ' may soon echo through the forest night . "

Jittery stock markets , an economy drunk on credit , and politicians calling for varieties of dictatorship : what a sense of déjà vu !
Let us recall that the world went bonkers for about ten years way back when .
The stock market crashed in 1929 , thanks to the Federal Reserve , and with it fell the last remnants of the old liberal ideology that government should leave society and economy alone to flourish .
After the federal Great Depression hit , there was a general air in the United States and Europe that freedom had n't worked .
What we needed were strong leaders to manage and plan economies and societies .
And how they were worshipped .
On the other side of the world , there were Stalin and Hitler and Mussolini , but in the United States we were n't in very good shape either .
Here we had FDR , who imagined himself capable of astonishing feats of price setting and economy boosting .
Of course he used old - fashioned tricks : printing money and threatening people with guns .
It was nothing but the ancient despotism brought back in pseudo - scientific garb .
Things did n't really return to normal until after the war .
These " great men " of history keeled over eventually , but look what they left : welfare states , inflationary banking systems , high taxes , massive debt , mandates on business , and regimes with a penchant for meddling at the slightest sign of trouble .
They had their way even if their absurd posturing became unfashionable later .
It 's strange to go back and read opinion pieces from those times .
It 's as if everyone just assumed that we had to have either fascism or socialism , and that the one option to be ruled out was laissez - faire .
People like Mises and Hayek had to fight tooth and nail to get a hearing .
The Americans had some journalists who seemed to understand , but they were few and far between .
So what was the excuse for such a shabby period in ideological history ?
Why did the world go crazy ?
It was the Great Depression , or so says the usual explanation .
People were suffering and looking for answers .
They turned to a Strongman to bail them out .
There was a fashion for scientific planning , and the suffering economy ( caused by the government , of course ) seemed to bolster the rationale .
All of which brings me to a strange observation : when it comes to politics , we are n't that much better off today .
It 's true that we do n't have people running for office in ridiculous military suits .
They do n't scream at us or give sappy fireside chats or purport to be the embodiment of the social mind .
The tune is slightly changed , but the notes and rhythms are the same .
Have you listened carefully to what the Democrats are proposing in the lead - up to the presidential election ?
It 's just about as disgusting as anything heard in the 1930s : endless government programs to solve all human ills .
It 's as if they can't think in any other way , as if their whole worldview would collapse if they took notice of the fact that government can't do anything right .
But it also seems like they are living on another planet .
The stock market has a long way to fall before it reaches anything we could call low .
Mortgage interest rates are creeping along at the lowest possible rates .
Unemployment is close to 4 % , which is lower than even Keynesians of old could imagine in their wildest dreams .
The private sector is creating a miracle a day , even as the stuff that government attempts is failing left and right .
The bureaucracies are as wasteful and useless as they 've ever been , spending is already insanely high , debt is skyrocketing , and there 's no way that any American believes himself to be under - taxed .
The Democrats , meanwhile , go about their merry business as if the public schools were a model for all of society .
Oh , and let us not forget their brilliant idea of shutting down the industrial economy and human prosperity so the government can plan the weather 100 years from now .
We can only hope that there are enough serious people left to put a stop to this harebrained idea .
But before we get carried away about the Democrats , let 's say a few words about the bloodthirsty Republicans , who think of war not as something to regret , but rather the very moral life of the nation .
For them , justice equals Guantánamo Bay , and public policy means a new war every month , and vast subsidies to the military - industrial complex and such other Republican - friendly firms as the big pharmaceuticals .
Sure , they pay lip service to free enterprise , but it 's just a slogan to them , unleashed whenever they fear that they are losing support among the bourgeois merchant class .
So there we have it .
Our times are good , and yet we face a choice between two forms of central planning .
They are varieties of socialism and fascism , but not overtly : they disguise their ideological convictions so that we wo n't recognize that they and their ilk have certain predecessors in the history of political economy .
It is impressive how crowds are hard - pressed to disagree with him .
How much good is he doing ?
It is impossible to exaggerate it .
He provides hope when we need it most .
You see , the American economy may look good on the surface but underneath , the foundation is cracking .
The debt is unsustainable .
Savings are nearly nonexistent .
Money - supply creation is getting scary .
The paper - money economy can't last and wo n't last .
One senses that the slightest change could cause unforeseen wreckage .
What would happen should the bottom fall out ?
Scary thought .
We need ever more public spokesmen for our cause .
In many ways , the Mises Institute bears a heavy burden as the world 's leading institutional voice for peace and economic liberty .
And we are working in every way possible to make sure that the flame of freedom is not extinguished , even in the face of legions of charlatans and powermongers .
Even though the politics of our times is as dark as ever , there are bright lights on the horizon .
Welcome to easilyamused .org 's official NNAMAM page !
Each February , we take time to take note of all the things of which we 're asked to take note during each of the months of the year .
( get that ?
good . )
Awareness ... if we are to devote entire months to it , we must first ask , what does it mean ?
WordNet defines it as :
awareness n 1 : having knowledge of ; " he had no awareness of his mistakes " ; " his sudden consciousness of the problem he faced " ; " their intelligence and general knowingness was impressive " [ syn : { consciousness} , {cognizance} , { cognisance} , { knowingness} ] 2 : state of elementary or undifferentiated consciousness ; " the crash intruded on his awareness " [ syn : { sentience} ]
So , clearly , we are being called upon to maintain a state of sentience .
This , I can support .
To this end , we 've scoured the web to bring you the big list of awareness months !
In the spirit of inclusiveness , we list not only observances which strictly follow the " National _____ Awareness Month " form , but also others with a basic philosophical similarity .
There are too many of us .
911 was an inside job .
AIDS was man made .
The Fed is a private entity .
Bilderberg secretly rules the world .
KBR has built concentration camps all over the US as part of a program in DHS called end game .
Privatized water .
Genetically engineered food with suicide genes .
Big Pharma is turning everyone in junkies .

I am now in a complete outrage coma .
I can see and hear all the horrible things going on all around me ( which is an improvement over most of the brain dead citizenry ) but what used to be used to be a knee jerk “ Motherf* cker ! ” reaction has been subdued all the way down to a tired shrug .
I ’ve been worn down to a nub , and this nub just does n’t care anymore .
This can happen to any red blooded American progressive these days .
For those of us who frequent OPED and other alternative media sites it is easy to assume the sensory overload induced thousand mile stare .
But my despair comes from a different terrible knowledge , one that I have surprised in my own psyche for a while .
Now what I ’m going to say here is going to be harsh , you have been warned .
There are too many of us .
Overpopulation on a planet with finite resources ; that is real truth that no one dares speak .
It ’s a reality that is hard to accept let alone work towards solving .
For to solve it would mean to betray our own natural instincts .
To even discuss it is uncomfortable for most people .
I ’m a bad , bad blogist and so have no reference for these statistics :
Every second 5 babies are born and 2 people die
I just found it through a google search .
But you get the point .
How is it that 1 million people can die in Iraq and twice that in northern Africa and it hardly registers in the American public ’s collective conscience ?
It ’s because life is cheap .
If life was a commodity traded in the world markets it would be rated as junk .
Oh , but not all life is created equal .
There are many divisions and categories to consider when considering the value of a life .
When was it started ?
Where was it started ?
How productive has it been so far ?
How productive is its potential in the future ?
What is its lineage ?
And then there are the really stupid but seemingly more important factors .
What sex is it ?
What color is it ?
What religion does it belong to ?
What political affiliations does it have ?
What are its ’ sexual preferences ?
What is really interesting think about is that perhaps we already do , in a manor of speaking , make these value judgments on the value of human life .
Workers in Mexico are paid less than workers in America because ?
Employers prefer workers under the age of 30 because ?
There are n’t hundreds of thousands of Indians roaming the great plains of Wyoming because ?
I could go on but you ’re already doing it in your own head while simultaneously condemning me for pointing it out .
This brings me to all the atrocities being rote against humanity today … today and everyday from the beginning of civilization in actuality .
Because if there really is an all powerful elite class ruling the world from the shadows they most definitely understand how to value human life .
Indeed if they do exist , their actions suggest not only that they can equate the value of life but they can also manipulate its price .
Is AIDS African or homosexual population control ?
Is the war on terror Arab population control ?
Is cancer ?
Is depleted uranium ?
War on Drugs ?
War itself ?
Population control can only be accomplished either by not having children or by killing people .
Now think about this very carefully , which do you think would be easier for the people of this planet to accept ?

Threat of closing jolts fishing industry 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
The grim prospect of a total shutdown of ocean salmon fishing in California and Oregon is forcing anglers , merchants and food servers who rely on the once - thriving fishery to reassess their lives and futures .
So few fall - run chinook came back to spawn in the Sacramento River and its tributaries last fall that the Pacific Fishery Management Council said Tuesday it would have to ban all salmon fishing unless a request is made for an emergency exception .
By Wednesday , the news had cast a pall over fishermen and salmon lovers from San Francisco to Cape Falcon in n0orthern Oregon .
Fisheries managers canceled early - season ocean fishing for chinook off Oregon , where commercial trolling had been set to open Saturday and run through April up to the Oregon - California border .
Even representatives of the salmon industry , who have made it a practice to lobby for more fishing , are saying that the situation is so bad it would be irresponsible for fishermen to put their hooks in the water even if the commercial season in California opens as scheduled in May .
" I think if we do have fishing , we 're shooting ourselves in the foot , " said Duncan MacLean , the California representative of commercial fishing , at the management council meetings this week at the Doubletree Hotel in Sacramento .
" Frankly I 'm scared , because what 's happened here has nothing to do with harvest , but we 're left holding the bag to fix it all . "
MacLean and other fishermen blame drinking water managers for building dams , river water to farmers and agricultural runoff that they say has damaged the fishery , and the prospect of losing their livelihoods because of those things makes them angry .
Others have blamed climate change and a deteriorating ocean ecosystem .
" I 'm 57 and I 've been doing this for 36 years , so it 's hard to change horses in this stream , " said MacLean , a well known veteran among salmon fishermen .
" There 's a lot of people in this industry like me . "
The council is expected to come up with three options about what to do about the salmon fishing season Friday .
A monthlongpublic comment period will be followed by a final decision the second week of April .
One of the options will be to shut down the salmon fishing season before it begins , meaning commercial and recreational fishing would be prohibited .
The other two options are likely to include some sport fishing and maybe limited commercial fishing .
Impact on the coast
The collapse will impact recreational and commercial fishing industries all along the Pacific coast .
There are about 400 commercial salmon fishermen and women in California and about 1,000 commercial fishermen from Santa Barbara to Washington State .
Closure of the fishery would also eliminate fresh West Coast salmon from grocery shelves and restaurants and drive up the price of wild salmon .
It would hurt entire communities in the Sacramento River watershed - freshwater fishing in the watershed would presumably be included in the ban - where fishing and tourism are a primary economic engine .
Barbara Emley , 64 , who has run a commercial fishing boat with her husband out of Fisherman 's Wharf since 1985 , said salmon makes up about 70 percent of her annual income .
" We 'll probably try crabbing longer , but if everyone shifts from salmon to crab , there will be more competition , " she said .
" I think we can survive the year , but I 'm afraid it will go on . "
If the crisis continues , she said , it could spell the end of a unique , nomadic culture of people who love the sea .
" It is like a town with pieces that break off and float around and then re-form in a different shape in another place , " she said .
" I think that culture is being lost . "
Ben Platt , a 45 - year - old commercial fisherman based in Fort Bragg , said he will have to turn to crabbing and other kinds of fishing to make up some of his losses , but he cannot sustain himself that way for very long .
" I 'm prepared to weather one storm , but we 've had severely restricted seasons since 2006 and we 're looking at a total collapse of the Central Valley system , " said Platt , who figures he will spend all of his savings over the next two years waiting for the salmon to return .
" At some point fishing becomes no longer feasible . "
The Klamath and Trinity river run along the Pacific Coast , much smaller than the Sacramento run , was declared a disaster in 2006 after a similar decline .
It led to a dismal commercial and recreational salmon catch last year .
Restaurateurs and their customers are also looking at hard times if salmon season closes .
Chef wo n't use farmed
" We 'll stay away from salmon for a while , " said Ryan Simas , the head chef at Farallon Restauranton Union Square .
" I will definitely not use farmed salmon . "
Paul Johnson , the president of Monterey Fish Market , a high - end seafood wholesaler at Pier 33 in San Francisco , with a retail market in Berkeley , said things wo n't be the same without local salmon .
" Oh man , I 'm telling you the king ( chinook ) salmon is the icon in the Bay Area ; this is going to be devastating to the economy , " he said .
" It 's put everyone on edge .
A lot of small - boat fishermen are going to go out of business . "
Johnson said his market might offer a limited amount of king salmon from Alaska and Canada , " but it 's going to be brutally expensive . "
Emley said most fishermen at the meetings this week appear to be resigned to their fate .
" We know there are no fish , " she said .
" Fishermen always say ' better times are coming , ' but I 'm not so sure this time . "
The council 's salmon management plan , which is part of the 1976 Magnuson - Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act , requires the Pacific Fishery Management Council to close ocean fishing if the number of spawning salmon do not reach the conservation objectives set for the fishery .
The latest fall run count in the Central Valley watershed in 2007 was 68,101 , well below the goal of 122,000 to 180,000 .
The number of jack salmon - 2 - year - old fish that come back early to spawn - was the lowest on record .
Even if there is no fishing this year , the council is projecting that only 59,000 salmon will come back to spawn during the 2008 Sacramento River fall run , which peaks in September and October .
Knowing that , the council is expected to vote to close the season .
It would mark the first time that the federal agency , created 22 years ago to manage the Pacific Coast fishery , will have banned salmon fishing , which was scheduled to begin for recreational fishers in April and for the commercial industry in May .
Typically , the season continues through mid-November .
Getting Real , Step 1 : No Functional Spec
09 Feb 2005 by Jason Fried
We talk a lot about our “ Getting Real ” process at the Building of Basecamp workshops ( next one to be announced shortly — sign up for the mailing list at the bottom of the sidebar to be notified ) .
Getting Real is all about starting from the user interface and customer experience and then building out .
Visual design first , programming second .
The more traditional process is starting from the abstract ( documentation , diagrams , charts , etc. ) , coding a skeleton app , and then homing in on the real by finishing it up with an interface .
We think that ’s backwards .
Over the next few weeks I ’ll be writing more about our Getting Real process , but I wanted to jump in by first talking about step 1 …
Step 1 : Do n’t write a functional specifications document
Do n’t write a functional specifications document .
Why ?
Well , there ’s nothing functional about a functional specifications document .
Functional specifications documents lead to an illusion of agreement .
A bunch of people agreeing on paragraphs of text is not real agreement .
Everyone is reading the same thing , but they ’re often thinking something different .
This inevitably comes out in the future when it ’s too late .
“ Wait , that ’s not what I had in mind … ” “ Huh ?
That ’s not how we described it . ”
“ Yes it was and we all agreed on it — you even signed off on it . ”
You know the drill .

Furious business leaders last night condemned an " intrusive " questionnaire that requires them to reveal how many gays and transsexuals they employ .
The so - called " supplier diversity development questionnaire " is sent to all bidders for contracts with the London Development Agency .
It asks about the racial origin of a firm 's employees , then about their sexual orientation .
The questions include : " Is your organisation mostly owned or led by LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transperson ) people ? " and " What is the percentage of LGBT staff in your workforce ? "
The LDA receives £ 400 million of Government funding each year and its board is appointed by London Mayor Ken Livingstone .
It says it needs the data to monitor progress towards its goal of " maximising the diversity of its supplier base " .
But the director of a company bidding for a contract to refurbish a London fire station said : " I was dumbstruck when I saw the questionnaire .
" I looked at my dignified and proper middle - aged secretary and thought , I 'm not going to ask her if she is a lesbian , let alone a transperson .
The questions are intimate , intrusive and irrelevant . "
The businessman , who asked to remain anonymous , added : " It says the information will not be used to determine who wins the contract .
" But what if one firm is n't diverse and another has three transpersons on the payroll ?
It will be easy for the LDA to tick its equality box by using that firm .
" I employ builders , plumbers and engineers because they are good at their jobs – not because of their sexual preferences . "
Simon Briault of the Federation of Small Businesses said : " Tendering for work in the public sector is complicated enough without these strange and unnecessary questions . "
And Philip McCabe of the Forum of Private Business said : " Managers should be making sure employees can do their jobs properly , not enquiring into their sexual orientation . "
The LDA has faced fierce criticism amid allegations that it gave hundreds of thousands of pounds to projects linked to Mr Livingstone 's race and equality adviser Lee Jasper and his associates .
An LDA spokesman said : " The LGBT community experiences discrimination and we seek this information as there are concerns about fair and equal access to business opportunities . "
THE HAGUE ( Reuters ) - The U.N. war crimes tribunal cleared Kosovo ’s former prime minister on Thursday of persecuting Serbs in a 1998 - 99 separatist war , a move expected to fan tensions simmering over Kosovo ’s secession .
Former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj awaits his verdict at the courtroom of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague April 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Ernst / Pool
Ramush Haradinaj , a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) considered a hero by Kosovo Albanians , was acquitted of torture , murder , rape and deportation after judges found prosecutors had failed to prove a deliberate campaign to kill and expel Serb civilians from Kosovo .
“ This is a verdict that strengthens Kosovo .
We endured a difficult liberation struggle that cost many lives .
Today we are a free and sovereign nation , ” Haradinaj said in a statement , adding he would dedicate his life to equal opportunities to all .
Kosovo ’s 90 percent Albanian majority declared independence from Serbia in February .
The United Nations has run the province since 1999 when NATO drove out Serb forces to halt the ethnic cleansing of Albanians in a two - year war against KLA guerrillas .
The ruling was met with anger in the Kosovo Serb stronghold of north Mitrovica , the focal point of Serb resistance to the new state .
Some 120,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo among two million Albanians , most still looking to Belgrade as their government .
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica , a champion of Serbia ’s claim to Kosovo , condemned the acquittal .
“ Today ’s dark decision by the Hague tribunal shows that the purpose of that court is not justice , ” he said .
“ With this ruling the tribunal mocks justice and the innocent victims who suffered at Haradinaj ’s hands . ”
The decision was sure to inflame nationalist passions in Serbia and may boost the hardline vote in a May election .
Analysts say the decision would also make it harder for any government to justify the delivery to The Hague of remaining ethnic Serb war crimes fugitives -- a key European Union condition for offering Serbia a pact on closer ties .
FIREWORKS , GUNFIRE
Haradinaj was the most senior former KLA guerrilla to be indicted over the war .
In the Kosovo capital Pristina the sound of car horns , fireworks and gunfire greeted the verdict , while onlookers cheered and clapped in a packed court public gallery .
Prosecutors had sought prison sentences of 25 years for 39 - year - old Haradinaj and his two co-accused .
Haradinaj ’s uncle , Lahi Brahimaj , a senior KLA figure , was cleared of most charges but sentenced to six years jail for personally taking part in the cruel treatment of a detainee at a camp , and ordering the mistreatment of a perceived collaborator .
A third accused , Idriz Balaj , the commander of the KLA ’s “ Black Eagles ” special unit , was also cleared of all charges of torture , murder , rape and deportation .
Although the court found that KLA soldiers had committed a large number of crimes alleged in the indictment , it was not convinced that this was part of a wider , deliberate campaign .
“ Murders and attacks were not on a scale or of a frequency to conclude that there was an attack on the civilian population , ” Judge Alphons Orie told the court .
Serbs had fled , judges concluded , for fear of being caught up in the conflict rather than because they were directly targeted .
Kosovo Albanians had also fled , they noted .
Judge Orie said witnesses had been intimidated throughout the trial and some eventually refused to testify , meaning prosecutors had to rely on flimsy testimony .
Judges branded other evidence by turn vague , inconclusive or non existent .
The prosecution said it would study the ruling before deciding whether to appeal , in particular the weight the judges gave to witness problems , a spokeswoman said .
Haradinaj , a former nightclub bouncer , was prime minister for only a matter of months before he resigned in 2005 after being indicted by the U.N. tribunal .
He said on Thursday he had told the people of Kosovo they could trust the judicial process .
His defense lawyers said the soldier - turned - politician had fought an honorable war , targeting combatants not civilians .
Haradinaj ’s wife , Anita , said her husband planned to return to Kosovo on Friday morning : “ This is a happy and important day for Kosovo .
We will welcome Ramush home to an independent Kosovo , ” she told Kosovo public television from The Hague .

Police found wires in the house
Rita McKenna and her daughter , Edel , spied on their tenants in Glasnevin .
The students suspected they were being bugged when the landladies mentioned details of private conversations .
But when they complained they were evicted .
Police , however , found the flats had been wired for secret video recording equipment .
Damages up to 12,500 euro each were awarded for privacy breaches .
The students , from Armagh , Monaghan , Mayo , Galway and Donegal , rented a total of nine rooms at Mobhi Road in the upmarket Glasnevin suburb of Dublin during 2003 and 2004 .
The students paid 80 euro a week for a shared room and 90 euro for a single room , and an extra five euro for a meter - operated television .
' Electronic surveillance '
They became concerned late in 2004 that their conversations and activities were being monitoring .
When they raised the issue , they were evicted within four hours and left outside with their belongings in binbags and boxes .
One student took legal action against the mother and daughter , which was settled out of court by the pair in 2004 .
But engineering investigators and a garda officer sent to the house to search on foot of a court order related to that case , were locked out when they arrived , but saw people hurriedly moving inside the house with torchlights .
After the settlement , the students who had lodged with the McKennas instead lodged writs , suing for breach of privacy and damages in a court case heard this week in Dublin .
Judge Gerard Griffin told Dublin Circuit
Court that the evidence in the case left him " in no doubt whatsoever that the defendants had kept these plaintiffs under electronic surveillance " .
The judge said he could not say whether it was audio or video surveillance or both , but he was concerned that yellow wires found in the house were of the international standard used for video recording .
He said the tenants were " unceremoniously evicted " with less than four hours ' notice and left to their own devices with their belongings in black bin bags and boxes .
Judge Griffin agreed their privacy had been infringed and awarded them damages of between 7,500 euro and 12,500 euro each .
Their evictions were also unlawful and had caused great distress to students living far from home with little money and facing exams , he said .
Dublin Institute of Technology Students '
Union which backed the students when they were left out in the cold welcomed the verdict .
Union president Andy Doyle said : " We worked for the students the night they were evicted and provided them with support and gave evidence on their behalf .
" While this type of situation is rare , any students in difficulties like should get in touch for help and not feel alone . "
You'd think that with a name like " One Laptop Per Child , " NickNeg and company would have stress - tested their laptop with some actual children , but it looks like everyone 's favorite green machine just is n't up to the toddler challenge -- OLPC owners are reporting that the laptop 's rubberized keyboard is easily destroyed by inquisitive kids , who are peeling the keys off like so many scratch 'n ' sniff stickers .
Apparently the keyboards start to split above the U and J keys , and then Junior 's off to the races .
What 's worse , OLPC does n't appear to be shipping out replacement keyboards right now , leaving frustrated owners in the lurch .
Not to fear , though : Instructables is to the rescue with a pretty sweet USB keyboard mod .
Here 's what we 're wondering though -- if the OLPC can't handle the abuse of some ungrateful little yuppie larvae , how is this thing supposed to hold up in the developing world ?

I ’ve been thinking about conditions .
Actually I ’ve been thinking about bailouts , freezes on rate resets , speculators , owner occupancy , property equity , current performance , and pregnancy .
The RE mortgage bubble continues to pass gas .
Billions of write - offs / write - downs in carrying values have occurred with MEGA - billions more to come .
The mass marketing of the derivative paper behind these “ pulse loans ” ( you have a pulse , you got the loan ) have made this a global problem because investors worldwide got sucked into the euphoria of these highly questionable “ investment ” vehicles .
Please read on .
You see last Thursday the President announced a coalition - type plan to “ contain ” the unwinding of the Sub - prime / Alternative - A loan debacle .
The proposal is being marketed as a non-bailout , where a consortium of players will ultimately bear the heat – and the losses .
This is bunk .
This attempt to fix the mess will prove to be a half - hearted ( make that lame ) effort to buy some time before the grim rate re-setter ultimately triumphs .
The S & L mess of almost two decades ago cost $ 500 billion and the deep pockets of Uncle $ ugar ( make that the taxpayers ) footed the bill .
This financial Armageddon will eclipse that total and now Uncle not only lacks the deep pockets , I ’m not convinced he even has the pants !
This super - hyped plan on the table - which has received worldwide press - proposes to contain the costs by limiting the eligible recipients .
The plan proposes to instigate a 5 year freeze on the teaser rates in the effort to slow defaults , foreclosures , and financial misery .
This is a good thing in principle as any governmental intervention cannot be all things to all the injured and the aggrieved parties .
The conditions proposed make a lot of sense on an individual condition basis , but the big question – after all respective exclusions – is just who is left to reap from the stay of execution , or the pardon ?
The first condition requires that the properties be owner occupied .
This excludes the speculators who gambled on the faulty premise that property values would continue to rise .
Down the pike these real estate investment parcels would be flipped to someone paying an even higher price , the initial mortgage financings would be paid off , and a profit pocketed .
Someone else would hold an even bigger mortgage , until they too , flipped the property .
This was the daisy chain I saw again and again in the S&L crisis .
Estimates under this condition affect some 25 % to 30 % of the Sub - prime / Alternative - A pool of units .
A second condition requires that any eligible property NOT already be in foreclosure .
This too is a good criterion .
How do you save a sinking ship that is already taking on water and listing to starboard or port ?
You do n’t !
We are already seeing the number of foreclosed properties approaching the excesses of the Great Depression .
Numbers now vary by geographic market from one in a few hundred to one in thirty !
The monthly numbers continue to soar .
This will continue as the case despite the plan proposed .
The third requisite mandates that the property have positive equity .
This condition should all but eliminate ANY of the Sub - Prime / Alternative - A properties .
The lion ’s share of these started out being 100 % financed .
Many such “ loans ” financed the closing costs and fees as well – so they started out with negative equity .
As this bubble seriously started to unwind - and pass gas - market values dropped .
Since the beginnings of 2007 property values have declined 5 % , 10 % , or 15 % across - the - board .
In some of the worst markets , the decline already exceeds 20 % for 2007 alone .
Now … even if the property was only initially financed at 100 % , or the subsequent flurry of the “ equity ” loans brought the property to 100 % financed , the subsequent drop in market value made the parcel “ up - side - down ” and thus not eligible !
If you add that the current payment status be “ performing ” - with no history of late payments on the property ’s ledger - to the aforementioned conditions and criteria ; just how many players will be still eligible to partake of the 5 year rate freeze ?
Let me put it this way … just how many guys do you know can become pregnant ?
I ’m Fred Cederholm and I ’ve been thinking .
You should be thinking , too .

Tomorrow morning , the House Committee on Science and Technology will challenge NASA 's vision for space exploration .
According to a document on their website , the legislators are planning to grill NASA 's representatives :
Does the exploration architecture , as laid out by NASA , present a technically and programmatically viable approach for executing exploration beyond low Earth orbit under a pay - as - you - go strategy ?
Is the United States on the right track to reach the Moon by 2020 , establish an outpost there , and eventually send humans to Mars , or do any changes need to be made to the architecture or implementation plan ?
How will progress in implementing the architecture be measured ?
How sustainable will NASA ’s planned exploration initiative be , given the assumed constrained budgetary outlook as well as the cutbacks in funding for long - lead exploration technology development ?
You can find the full meeting agenda here .
( pdf )
Part of NASA 's vision for space exploration is the Ares I program , which is a two - stage rocket that will launch astronauts into space .
Along with the Orion crew vehicle , it is meant to replace the aging space shuttle .
Critics would say that the project has exceeded its budget and is behind schedule .
Activists have proposed cheaper , simpler alternatives , such as a re-hash of the national launch system , which uses parts from existing rockets instead of a completely new design .
Update :
The meeting is over and you can find full video coverage here : Link
What do you think of the Ares program ?
Is it the right move for space exploration ?

It has a predictable pattern .
In fact , once someone starts calling for your resignation , your odds of survival are slim .
There has been a lot of it in politics .
Here ’s the prototype for a resignation .
A campaign official makes a statement that is not PC .
It ’s reported , and then the opposing camp ( or the news media ) call for a resignation .
That results in a swell of media and political speculation .
Ultimately , the offending spokesperson resigns with an apology .
It ’s a quick , easy and inexpensive series of stories .
Predictable and guaranteed headlines are the result .
Examples :
By the way , by my count , Hillary has lost more people to resignation than Barack .
I could be wrong , so , let me know .
Let ’s look a little more .
Clinton campaign manager and deputy manager resign ( February 2008 )
Larry Craig resigns from Romney campaign ( August 2007 )
Or , just look at the number of public and newsworthy resignations in the last year .
Maybe we should blame Don Imus .
The State Department executive after revealing he was a client of the so - called D.C. Madam
Rumsfeld ’s resignation back in late 2006 after so many calls for so many years
Romney called for the resignation of a judge he had appointed
Karl Rove
Karen Hughes
Albert Gonzales
Trent Lott
Dennis Hastert
Tony Blair
And all the calls for Larry Craig ’s resignation
Resignations always make news .
Just this week we have Eliot Spitzer and
Admiral Fallon .
And in Arizona , there is speculation about the impact of a possible John McCain resignation from the Senate .
Just in case you do n’t think it ’s in the alignment of the stars , here are some other recent high profile resignations :
These are just a few that have happened in less than a year .
Resignations always make news , and they rarely represent good news .
Why so many right now ?
Because
It 's time for a move .
It ’s the final year of President Bush ’s term .
People like Rove , Hughes , Dan Bartlett and a long list of others need to plan the rest of their lives .
Interestingly , you also have a near record on the number of GOP Members of Congress are calling it quits .
Sometimes , resignations are the only way out .
That was the case with Eliot Spitzer this week , and probably should have been the case with Senator Larry Craig .
But who will be left standing if every person with an opinion in a campaign is silenced with these quick calls for resignations ?
Surely there are some other campaign tactics besides the look for the gaffe , the call for a resignation and apology and the final banishment from the public stage .
One of the best things about this campaign has been the freshness of the political argument , the seemingly unrehearsed candidate moments and the new voices added to the debate .
The “ calls to resign ” are becoming tiresome and seem unfair when we all know that in the public ’s mind , resignation is tantamount to the admission of guilt .
On this mini-super Tuesday , Hillary and Barack battle for supremacy while McCain adds to his delegate count and finally tries to bury Huckabee .
But it was only a short 2 months ago that the stage was full of contenders and many were still hopeful .
So what happened to the losers ?
Here 's a look at what 's up with the websites of the failed Presidential candidates .
It 's interesting , but not surprising , that almost every one of these sites still offers you the ability to contribute , save two Fred Thompson and Mitt Romney .
So lets start with them .
Fred Thompson - Fred 's site is blank .
Like Fred 's flash - in - the - pan candidacy , his site is a big white page of nada .
Only 1 word loads for me " Success " .
And that 's warped unless you think getting crushed is a good thing .
Mitt Romney - Stripped of all content accept a thank you note .
Chris Dodd - Currently asking for donations to help pay his campaign debts .
Rudy Guiliani - Rudy 's site seems to have been stripped of all content - much like his failed candidacy .
The front page has lots of blank spaces and so do much of the category pages .
Joe Biden -
You can see a video thank you speech from Joe and then scroll through his other campaign ideas .
Mike Gravel - Lead article on his site states he 's suing a Pro-Clinton 527 for airing an illegal ad .
Is he still in the race ?
I had no idea .
John Edwards - A thank you note .
Bill Richardson - A thank you note .
Dennis Kucinich -
There 's an article on his concession speech .
But no real note of thanks from him .
But Kucinich is in a tough fight for his Congressional seat so that site is up and kicking .
Tom Vilsack -
He got out before anything really began .
A thank you note .
A list of the unstimulated
The Tax Policy Center estimates that about 10 percent of Americans wo n’t be getting a rebate check this spring .
With the aid of Chad Stone , the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , we ’ve identified some would - be economic stimulators who are in for some disappointing news :
Disabled people :
If you were n’t a veteran , disability itself wo n’t get you the check , even if you ’re living on about $ 600 a month in public benefits , as many are .
College students and the very poor :
If you made less than $ 3,000 this year , forget about it .
Public benefits do n’t count — it has to be earned income .
The unemployed : Senate Democrats , joined by some Republicans , tried but failed to include extended unemployment benefits in the package .
If you ’ve been unemployed all year and did n’t make $ 3,000 , you get nothing .

The Inside Account of the
Story That Almost Killed Me
Saturday , June 23 , 2007
By Paulette Cooper
Today 's issue of http://www.radaronline.com/ has a shortened version of my story HERE The Scandal of the Scandal of Scientology
By Paulette Cooper
You may not believe this , but you can write something that someone does n’t approve of and then — with the help of the government — be bankrupted and have a quarter of your life almost ruined .
And you do n’t have to live in China or Russia .
It can happen right here in New York .
I know because it happened to me .
I have n’t previously written about this from beginning to end because it ’s still painful , but here goes .
In 1968 , I was a struggling New York freelance writer , searching for an investigative story that would make a difference .
By choosing to expose a then relatively unknown organization called Scientology ( and Scientology ’s companion , Dianetics ) , I ended up facing fifteen years in jail , had nineteen lawsuits filed against me , did fifty days of depositions , was the almost victim of a murder , the subject of five anonymous smear letters and endured almost constant and continual harassment for more than a dozen years .
It all started after I wrote an article , “ The Scandal of Scientology , ” for Queen magazine in the U.K .
I had a master ’s degree in psychology and had studied comparative religion at Harvard for a summer and what I learned during my research about the group founded by L. Ron Hubbard was both fascinating and frightening .
The story cried out to be told .
I received one death threat after the article was published , but decided nonetheless to write a book on the subject .
I knew the Scientologists would n’t like what I said but I was naïve and had no idea of the horrors that lay in store for me over the next two decades .
The Scandal of Scientology was released by a small publisher , Tower Publications , in 1971 .
After fighting five lawsuits brought against them ( and me ) by the Church of Scientology , the publisher signed an apology and recalled the book .
However , I refused to be silenced and the suits were soon directed at me , along with death threats , pretexting and harassing calls .
So why were they so concerned about what a young New York writer had to say ?
No hard - hitting exposé had ever been written about Scientology .
Among other things , I stated that the crux of Scientology — their e-meter , a machine that acts like a lie detector — produced questionable results ; that Hubbard had lied about his background ; that Charles Manson had been a student of Scientology ( which was later proven but which they did n’t want known ) ; and that some auditors had behaved improperly .
I also heavily quoted an out - of - print “ Report of the Board of Enquiry into Scientology , ” a devastating and detailed document published by the Australian government in 1965 .
Before long , strange people were trying to gain access to my apartment .
Around this same time , in the basement of the building , I discovered alligator clips on my phone wires — likely the remnants of a phone tap .
Then my cousin — who was also short and slim like me , was there alone when a man arrived with a “ flower delivery " for me .
When she opened the door , the intruder pulled a gun out of the flowers and put it to her temple .
Fortunately , the gun jammed , misfired or was empty .
The man then began to choke her , and when she pulled away and I immediately moved to a doorman building .
Not long after , some 300 of my neighbors were sent an anonymous smear letter about me .
Among other things , the letter outrageously described me as a part - time prostitute and said that I had once sexually molested a 2 - year old baby girl .
A few weeks later , in early 1973 , I received a visit from an FBI agent named Bruce Brotman .
He said the spokesman for the Church of Scientology in New York , James Meisler , claimed to have received anonymous bomb threats and named me as a likely suspect .
The next thing I knew , I was being called to appear before a federal grand jury in New York .
Pulling together all the funds from my freelance writing , I hired a lawyer and paid him a retainer of $ 5,000 .
Little could I have realized that the firm I hired , headed by Charles Stillman , would ultimately charge me $ 28,000 for their services — and then sue me after the case was over for even more money !
During the grand jury process , the prosecutor , John D. Gordon III , explained to me that I was facing five years in jail for each of the two letters that I had supposedly sent , plus five years if I perjured myself , plus $ 15,000 in fines .
Then Gordon dropped the real bomb .
After I truthfully testified that I had never touched or even seen the semi-literate letters that he presented before the grand jury ( dated December 8 and December 13 , 1972 ) , he asked me : “ Then how did your fingerprint get on one of them ? ” I was so shocked I think I momentarily lost consciousness , because the room turned upside down .
I ( rightly ) explained that the bomb threats could have been written on a blank piece of paper that I had touched , and threats typed afterwards by others .
But Gordon was unconvinced .
On May 9th , 1973 , I was indicted on three counts ( two of sending two bomb threats through the mail and one for perjury for denying sending the threats ) by the U.S. Attorney ’s Office for the Southern District of New York .
Ten days later I was arrested — even more humiliating — released on my own recognizance and barred from leaving the state without permission “ Who ’d want to go to New Jersey anyway ? ” I joked with my friends .
But inside , I was n’t laughing .
Mostly , I worried obsessively about jail .
About fines .
About my career .
Up to that point , I had been doing pretty well .
I had four books out or soon to come out , by the time I was thirty : The Medical Detectives , a book on forensic medicine that today would probably have been a best - seller ; a children ’s book ; and a book on Puerto Ricans in New York .
But once the story of my trial came out , what editor would give an assignment to a writer accused of sending bomb threats to the people she wrote about ?
I had wanted to be a writer since I was eight years old , which is why it was so painful when it appeared that my career was about to be over .
I was also very concerned about my parents .
They had adopted me from an orphanage in Belgium when I was six , and I had always tried to make them proud .
However , I feared that soon they would be humiliated by the allegations made during the trial .
I knew the prosecutors would stop at nothing to dig up potentially embarrassing details of my private life and I imagined that I ’d be fodder for the tabloids during the trial , which was predicted to last three weeks .
I volunteered to take lie - detector tests to prove my innocence .
But they returned contradictory and inconclusive results .
Not surprisingly , the tests also showed me to be highly stressed .
My depression became so bad that the man I had planned to marry , a lawyer named Bob Straus , left me early that summer .
Most of my friends also stopped calling .
Fortunately , an editor friend at the New York Times stuck by me and kept me on the phone for hours to stop me from continuing to take the entire bottle of Valium I had started the night of my thirtieth birthday .
Another loyal friend was a new one , an understanding young man named Jerry Levin , a short smiling readhead , who moved in with me late that summer .
Since I was too depressed to go out much , he did my errands and walked my dog while I compulsively watched the Watergate hearings .
Occasionally , he would get me to go up to the rooftop pool with him at night when no one was there .
He would leap up to the ledge surrounding the pool and try to get me to join him .
“ You have to be brave if you ’re going to take on those bastards , ” he ’d say .
But I huddled below , a shadow of my former adventurous self .
I even became suspicious of him , and when I questioned him , Jerry turned on me , saying I had become so totally paranoid that I could no longer even trust my closest friend .
I knew he was right , but it did n’t help the hurt when he walked out of my life , leaving me alone to face the trial .
I hired a private investigator , Anthony Pelicano — the same one currently being held in federal detention in Los Angeles while he awaits trial for racketeering and conspiracy .
He accomplished nothing on my behalf .
Meanwhile , the court date , October 31 , 1973 , was drawing near .
The ledge surrounding the rooftop pool of her apartment building :
the perfect spot for an " accident . "
Shortly beforehand , a university professor and researcher from Scotland , a man by the name of Dr. Roy Wallis came to interview me as part of a book he was writing on Scientology .
Prior to meeting with me , he had interviewed L. Ron Hubbard , Jr. During their meeting , Junior boastfully showed Wallis a copy of a letter he had written to his father , L. Ron Hubbard Sr. , right before my frameup , saying that with one stroke , he could “ bring the enemy to their [ sic ] knees . ”
Wallis , who ’d been unaware of my impending trial when he came to see me brought this letter and more to the U.S. Attorney ’s office , which had a growing file on Scientology ’s “ fair game law ” : that an “ ‘ enemy ’ of Scientology ” — such as me —
” May be…injured by any means by any Scientologist … May be tricked , sued or lied to or destroyed . ”
Despite this pile of evidence , once the government arrests someone , it does n’t tend to back off .
Nor do prosecutors like to miss out on high - publicity cases .
So , in a last - ditch effort , I started searching for a doctor to give me a truth - serum test .
At a mere 83 pounds — fifteen pounds lighter than my already low normal weight and with my health horribly off kilter — I was told that I could die from the anesthesia .
But it was my only hope .
I honestly planned to kill myself before the trial rather than humiliate myself and my parents once the news stories came out .
( Up to this point , the press had not caught wind of the upcoming trial , so there had been no advance publicity . )
Finally , neurologist Dr. David Coddon , of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , agreed to administer the serum .
After several hours of questioning me while I was out , he was so convinced I was innocent , that he said not only would he testify for me , but that he would chain himself to the courthouse steps if they proceeded with this case .
( Just what I needed ; more publicity ! )
On Halloween day , 1973 , the government canceled the trial .
Between the expert advice of Coddon , an affidavit from Wallis and the information we had supplied on “ fair game , ” the government apparently decided that a victory for the prosecution was far from guaranteed .
The federal attorneys agreed to file a nolle prosequi , on the condition that I agree to have psychotherapy for a year which I did .
By the way , later , the Scientologists broke into one of my shrink 's offices and stole my records of what I had said .
Nice , eh ?.
And on September 16 , 1975 , the nolle prosequi was filed .
But this story was hardly over .
During the next four years , I remained broke and bitter , writing articles for the National Enquirer to get out of debt .
In July 1977 , I was thrilled — and shocked — to read front - page stories in the Washington Post , the Boston Globe and others , that indicated the truth might finally be about to come out .
Acting on an inside tip , the FBI had raided three Scientology offices and seized internal memos and “ dirty trick ” papers .
I rejoiced that the truth — my innocence — would at last be known .
But it took me four frustrating years ( during which time I wrangled with more lawyers and unscrupulous private investigators than I care to count ) before I finally saw those documents .
Scientology fought tooth and nail to prevent the documents from being seen by the public .
They knew that such an outcome would be devastating publicity - wise and lawsuit - wise .
But my tenacity paid off .
And when I finally reviewed the documents , as I later told Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes : “ Scientology turned out to be worse than anything I ever said or even imagined . ”
The seized papers contained hundreds of dirty tricks , plots and details of infiltration , wiretapping and pretexting by Scientologists against government agencies ( FBI , IRS , and so on ) who had angered them .
There were also details of attacks against general critics ( including Clearwater , Florida , mayor Gabriel Cazares , who had dared to speak out ) ; the press ( The St. Petersburg Times especially ) and of course me , since I was the most outspoken critic of Scientology in America .
The most bizarre documents referred to “ Operation Freakout . ”
Its goal , they wrote , was to “ get P.C. , [ me ] incarcerated in a mental institution or jail or at least to hit her so hard that she drops her attacks . ”
It appeared that after the first frameup had failed to silence me or land me in prison , they plotted again to make it look like I was making bomb threats against Scientology and others .
Sounding eerily like the ‘ 72 letters , these new missives were going to go out to Scientology , to Henry Kissinger , to Arab embassies ( because I ’m Jewish ) and also to a Laundromat !
Go figure .
Other pages in the documents also brought back unhappy memories .
There was a strange diary of what I did each day during the “ frame - up ” period , and how close I was to suicide .
“ Would n’t that be great for Scientology ? ” the person wrote .
And then I realized the writer could only have been Jerry Levin .
He had to have been a Scientologist , someone who infiltrated my life specifically to spy on me and help Scientology set me up .
He and his friends , Paula Tyler and a woman calling herself Margie Shepherd ( may be Linda Kramer from Boston , who married and is Linda Kobern ) , had been in and out of my old apartment back during that time period and had access to paper on which someone could have obtained my fingerprint and then typed the threats Furthermore , I ’ve always wondered why he wanted me to go up on that ledge with him , thirty - three stories above the ground .
Did he plan to push me off ?
If he had , everyone would have simply assumed that — in my depressed state of mind — I had committed suicide .
Operation Freakout indeed .
As the ‘ 70s came to a close , a grand jury in New York spent three years investigating my frame - up .
Although I cooperated with the FBI , the case went nowhere because the Scientologists steadfastly refused to talk .
Bizarrely , they pleaded the First — not the Fifth — Amendment , claiming freedom of religion .
One Scientologist , Charles Batdorf , was jailed for refusal to speak about my frame - up .
But a simultaneous Washington , D.C. , grand jury ( and trial ) ultimately led to jail sentences for eleven Scientologists who were involved in wiretapping , infiltration and theft of government documents .
Some of those who were jailed had also been involved in the plots and actions against me .
In 1981 , I initiated my own action against Scientology , for their frame - up of me and for their years of harassment .
In 1985 , Scientology and I reached an “ amicable ” settlement of all lawsuits .
It was engineered by Albert Podell , a brilliant New York lawyer .
Through him , I became reacquainted with Paul Noble , a New York TV producer , whom I had dated when I was in my twenties , long before any of this had happened .
Paul and I have been very happily married for nineteen years now .
I have written eleven more books , do some travel writing as well as a newspaper column on pets .
While it ’s not as “ glamorous ” as investigative reporting , it ’s a nice change of pace .
Dogs do n’t harass and cats do n’t sue .
I also quit smoking , barely drink , and try to forget what happened .
Try .
But when I turn on the news or my e-mail , I ’m sometimes reminded of the years of torment I endured .
I may read about prosecutor Nifong who went after the innocent Duke soccer player and I am reminded of what another prosecutor did to an innocent person -- me .
Or I 'll get an e-mail from my friend and Scientology critic Arnie Lerma , telling me he just found out that Paula Tyler is still in the group , or that Margie Shepherd 's real name was Linda ___ and her married name is ____ and she 's still a member in Boston .
Or someone will send me an affidavit , like Margery Wakefield 's “ The second murder that I heard planned was of Paulette Cooper , who had written a book critical of Scientology , and they were planning to shoot her … ”
Other names keep bringing me back as well .
My useless private investigator Anthony Pellicano , of course , is all over the news .
My former attorney Charles Stillman defends big -name clients , including the Reverend Sun Myung Moon .
Bob Straus , the boyfriend who left me , went on to head a large New York organization for judicial misconduct .
Albert Podell is still my family lawyer .
John D. Gordon III is with Morgan Lewis .
Dr. David Coddon died in 2002 .
L. Ron Hubbard Jr. , who died in 1992 , ultimately saw his late father ’s organization for what it was ( though he later recanted some of his outspoken comments against the church ) .
Bruce Brotman retired from the FBI and made negative news stories in 2002 when , as the incoming director of security at Louisville International Airport , he refused to go through the airport ’s security system , reportedly saying , “ I make the rules . ”
Dr. Roy Wallis committed suicide in 1990 .
And while I ’ve never heard further of James Meisler or Charles Batdorf , I heard that Jerry Levin — which was definitely not his real name — is still a Scientologist and living in England .
One of the last major exposés on Scientology was a Time magazine cover story , in 1991 .
Scientology sued and lost , though it reportedly cost the publisher seven million dollars to successfully defend the case , which Scientology pursued on and off for a decade before finally resting when the U.S. Supreme Court refused , in 2001 , to reinstate the case .
Before and after the trial , the writer , extraordinary investigative reporter Richard Behar , was also miserably harassed .
Unfortunately , my experiences and those of people like Behar , have had a chilling effect on press coverage of Scientology .
( Would you write an exposé of Scientology after reading this ? )
That may be why they do n’t seem to mind that people can read portions of my story on the Internet .
I do get a lot of e-mails and I have no doubt that some of the people who e-mail me are Scientologists trying to find out what I ’m doing concerning them .
But since I have n’t been writing about Scientology , they ’ve pretty much left me alone .
Am I worried that they ’ll start up against me as a result of this article ?
Yes .
But thanks to the Internet , it ’s harder for them to get away with that sort of harassment — with me or with anyone else .
As for me , I often wish I had never ever heard the word “ Scientology . ”
But given the same situation , I would still do it all over again .
I would not have been capable of remaining quiet , because I learned too many scary things and talked to too many people who were being hurt .
However , I do wish I had remained quiet in another way — and not talked with others about what I was doing to fight Scientology .
I should n’t have let anyone near me or into my apartment unless I knew them well .
My mistake was being too trusting and too talkative .
free on the Internet and in several languages .
Some of the people that I helped have contacted me , and that gives me satisfaction .
About once a week I receive an email from someone who read my book , or read on the Internet how I stood up to Scientology and the person will write to tell me that I helped them .
My favorite was the man in his fifties who wanted me to know that years ago , after learning the truth about Scientology from my work , he left the organization , married , has four children ( two are twins ) and runs a computer company employing forty people .
He feels that I am responsible for the happiness he now enjoys .
That reminded me of why I did what I did and why journalists do what they do : we try to tell the truth so that we can help others .
Unfortunately , we sometimes pay a terrible price for it .

Surprise , Surprise ( not really )
These are some rather eye - opening facts .
Since the start of the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan , the sacrifice has been enormous .
In the time period from the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 through today , we have lost over 3,000 military personnel to enemy action and accidents .
As tragic as the loss of any member of the US Armed Forces is , consider the following statistics :
The annual fatalities of military members while actively serving in the armed forces from 1980 through 2006 :
1980 ……..2,392
1981 …….. 2,380
1984 …….. 1,999
1988 …….. 1,819
1989 …….. 1,636
1990 ……. 1,508
1991 …….. 1,787
1992 …….. 1,293
1993 ……..1,213
1994 …….. 1,075
1995 ……..2,465
1996 ……..2,318
Clinton years @ 14,000 deaths
1997 ……….817
1998 ……..2,252
1999 …….. 1,984
2000 …….. 1,983
2001 ……… 890
2002 …….. 1,007
2003 …….. 1,410
2004 …….. 1,887
2005 ……….919
2006 ………. 920
Bush years ( 2001 - 2006 ) : 7,033 deaths
If you are confused when you look at these figures , so was I .
Do these figures mean that the loss from the two latest conflicts in the middle East are LESS than the loss of military personnel during Mr. Clinton ’s presidency ; when America was n’t even involved in a war ?
And , I was even more confused ; when I read that in 1980 , during the reign of President ( Nobel Peace Prize winner ) Jimmy Carter , there were 2,392 US military fatalities !
These figures indicate that many members of our Media and our Politicians will pick and choose .
They present only those “ facts ” which support their agenda - driven reporting .
Why do so many of them march in lock - step to twist the truth ?
Where do so many of them get their marching - orders for their agenda ?

Perhaps it was one of those eureka moments , when the scientists realized they had discovered a new dinosaur with mouth parts designed to vacuum up food .
The 110 million - year - old plant eater , discovered in the Sahara Desert , was to be unveiled Thursday by the National Geographic Society .
LEARN MORE : Project Exploration describes the Nigersaurus Discoverer Paul Sereno named the elephant - sized animal Nigersaurus taqueti , an acknowledgment of the African country Niger and a French paleontologist , Philippe Taquet .
Sereno , a National Geographic explorer - in- residence and paleontologist at the University of Chicago , said the first evidence of Nigersaurus was found in the 1990s and now researchers have been able to reconstruct its skull and skeleton .
While Nigersaurus ' mouth is shaped like the wide intake slot of a vacuum , it has something lacking in most cleaners — hundreds of tiny , sharp teeth to grind up its food .
The 30 - foot - long Nigersaurus had a feather - light skull held close to the ground to graze like an ancient cow .
Sereno described it as a younger cousin of the North American dinosaur Diplodicus .
Its broad muzzle contained more than 50 columns of teeth lined up tightly along the front edge of tis jaw .
Behind each tooth more were lined up as replacements when one broke off .
Using CT scans the researchers were able study the inside of the animal 's skull where the orientation of canals in the organ that helps keep balance disclosed the habitual low pose of the head , they reported .
Nigersaurus also had a backbone consisting of more air than bone .
" The vertebrae are so paper - thin that it is difficult to imagine them coping with the stresses of everyday use — but we know they did it , and they did it well , " Jeffrey Wilson , assistant professor at the University of Michigan and an expedition team member , said in a statement .
The dinosaur 's anatomy and lifestyle were to be detailed in the Nov. 21 issue of journal PLoS ONE , the online journal from the Public Library of Science , and in the December issue of National Geographic magazine .
The first bones of Nigersaurus were picked up in the 1950s by French paleontologists , but the species was not named at that time .
Sereno and his team honored this early work by naming the species after Taquet .
The research was partly funded by National Geographic .

Joran Van der Sloot Confession VIDEO
Joran Van der Sloot confessed on hidden camera to disposing of Natalee Holloway 's body .
The revelation was made possible because of the undercover work initiated by Dutch TV reporter Peter de Vries .
He has blown the case wide open .
The case had been officially closed a short while back , when Aruban authorities released Joran Van der Sloot , Deepak Kalpoe and his brother Satish Kalpoe , after acknowledging that there was no new evidence in which to make a case against the trio .
It looked as if justice would not be served in the disappearance of the high school student .
The reporter , de Vries , was compelled to do a little undercover work and spent the last few months with a hidden video camera , patiently working to get a confession from Joran Van der Sloot .
The tape has been turned over to Aruban officials .
In the video , Van der Sloot implicated one of his friends , Daury Rodrigeuz , who came with a boat and took Natalee Holloway 's body approximately a mile out to sea where he reportedly dumped her overboard .
Check out Van der Sloot 's video confession after the jump .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Staff at the Federal Communications Commission are expected to recommend that it review rules on how phone and cable companies can use customer information as they try to take business from each other , an FCC official said on Friday .

The FCC enforcement bureau will recommend that the commission reject a complaint by cable operators charging that Verizon Communications
Inc violated the agency ’s customer privacy rules by using customer information to prevent them from switching their phone service to cable , an agency official said , on condition of anonymity .
Beyond that , the enforcement bureau is expected to recommend that the FCC address more broadly the issue of “ customer retention activities ” by both phone companies and cable operators to make sure the rules apply equally to both , the official said .
“ It is important that we do everything we can to maximize consumer choice and reduce rates . ” FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said in a statement on Friday .
“ In today ’s competitive telecommunications market we must make sure that there is a level playing field for all companies to compete . ”
Both Verizon and phone industry leader AT&T Inc offer high - speed Internet and video services that compete with cable , while cable providers sell phone services .
Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc , among others , had complained to the FCC in February that Verizon was improperly using its customers ’ information in order to stop them from switching their phone service .
In a recommendation expected on Friday , the enforcement bureau will say the FCC should turn down that complaint and look further into whether customer retention efforts on all sides are pro- or anti-competitive .
Comcast responded in a statement by saying : “ We are evaluating our legal options at the federal level and will continue to pursue our complaints with state public utility commissions . ”
Last month , Verizon countered the cable industry complaint by asking the FCC to make it easier for people to switch from cable television to video services offered by phone companies .
Verizon said consumers should be able to switch from cable as easily as they can change phone companies .
Phone companies accept cancellations from rival providers , but many cable companies require consumers to submit disconnection orders themselves .
Verizon issued a statement on Friday saying that cable operators ’ efforts “ to suppress communications would reduce consumer choice , and the bureau ’s recommendation to reject it is legally correct and good policy . ”
“ As the FCC looks at the rules , it should note that consumers cannot enjoy the full benefits of competition if companies are blocked from providing information on new choices , ” Verizon said .

A Chinese cargo ship believed to be carrying 77 tonnes of small arms , including more than 3 m rounds of ammunition , AK47 assault rifles , mortars and rocket - propelled grenades , has docked in the South African port of Durban for transportation of the weapons to Zimbabwe , the South African government confirmed yesterday .
It claimed it was powerless to intervene as long as the ship 's papers were in order .
Copies of the documentation for the Chinese ship , the An Yue Jiang , show that the weapons were sent from Beijing to the ministry of defence in Harare .
Headed " Dangerous goods description and container packing certificate " , the document was issued on April 1 , three days after Zimbabwe 's election .
It lists the consignment as including 3.5 m rounds of ammunition for AK47 assault rifles and for small arms , 1,500 40 mm rockets , 2,500 mortar shells of 60 mm and 81 mm calibre , as well as 93 cases of mortar tubes .
The carrier is listed as the Cosco shipping company in China .
South Africa 's national conventional arms control committee issued a permit on Monday for the trans - shipment of the cargo from Durban to Harare .
The head of government information in South Africa , Themba Maseko , said yesterday : " We are not in a position to act unilaterally and interfere in a trade deal between two countries . "
South Africa had to " tread very carefully " , given the complexity of the situation in Zimbabwe , Maseko said .
South Africa was not encouraging the purchase of weapons by Zimbabwe , he said , pointing out that there was no UN trade embargo against that country .
But Tony Leon , the South African opposition foreign affairs spokesman , said the shipment was tantamount to " putting a fuse in a powder keg " .
Dockers in Durban were refusing last night to unload the ship .
The SA Transport and Allied Workers Union 's general secretary , Randall Howard , said : " Satawu does not agree with the position of the government not to intervene with this shipment of weapons .
Our members will not unload this cargo , neither will any of our members in the truck - driving sector move this cargo by road . "
Despite international criticism , the Chinese government has been a longstanding backer of Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe 's authoritarian regime , supplying it with jet fighters , military vehicles and guns .
China , or Chinese businesses , are reported to have sold radio - jamming devices to prevent independent stations from contradicting the state - controlled media , and have signed vital agriculture deals .
Even the blue tiles on Mugabe 's latest 25 - bedroom mansion , reminiscent of Beijing 's Forbidden City , were a gift from China .
China has in the past used its veto at the UN security council to prevent the Zimbabwe issue from being raised , on the grounds that the country 's problems were an internal matter .
In Britain , William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said last night : " The international community must speak with one voice on Zimbabwe .
We call on China , as part of that community , to suspend arms sales to Zimbabwe .
" The Mugabe regime continues to deny the right of the people of Zimbabwe to choose their leaders .
To supply arms to it at time when opposition activists are being intimidated and attacked , not only sends the wrong signal , but will harm the reputation of China .
" In addition , it is time that neighbouring states like South Africa made clear that such shipments are not welcome . "
The Foreign Office was more cautious .
A spokeswoman said that Britain backed an EU ban on arms sales to Zimbabwe and was encouraging other governments to do the same .
The FO said it was monitoring the situation and seeking to verify reports about the ship 's cargo .
A spokesman for China 's foreign ministry said it was aware of the reports about the shipment , but needed more time to look into the matter .
The disclosure about the ship 's cargo follows claims by an official from the Zimbabwe opposition Movement for Democratic Change that Chinese soldiers had been seen in the country .
There were some signs yesterday that South Africa may at last be bending under international pressure , when the cabinet joined calls for the release of Zimbabwe 's election results .
Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , called on South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , to stand down as the chief mediator in the country 's election crisis , as the US criticised African governments for lack of action on the issue .
" It is time for Africa to step up , " the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said .
Tsvangirai told a news conference in Johannesburg : " President Mbeki needs to be relieved from his duty . "
Mbeki , is also under pressure from Jacob Zuma , the leader of the ruling African National Congress .
Zuma has adopted a more hostile attitude towards Mugabe , saying that " the region cannot afford a deepening crisis in Zimbabwe " .

If you have ever wondered why colleges and universities seem to march in lockstep on controversial issues like affirmative action , here is one reason : Overly politicized accrediting agencies often demand it .
Given that federal funding hinges on accreditation , schools are not in a position to argue .
That is precisely why the U.S. Department of Education , which gives accreditors their authority , must sometimes take corrective action .
George Mason University 's law school in northern Virginia is an example of why corrective action is needed now .
GMU 's problems began in early 2000 , when the American Bar Association visited the law school , which has a somewhat conservative reputation , for its routine reaccreditation inspection .
The site evaluation team was unhappy that only 6.5 % of entering students were minorities .
Outreach was not the problem ; even the site evaluation report ( obtained as a result of Freedom of Information Act requests ) conceded that GMU had a " very active effort to recruit minorities . "
But the school , the report noted , had been " unwilling to engage in any significant preferential affirmative action admissions program . "
Since most law schools were willing to admit minority students with dramatically lower entering academic credentials , GMU was at a recruitment disadvantage .
The site evaluation report noted its " serious concerns " with the school 's policy .
Over the next few years , the ABA repeatedly refused to renew GMU 's accreditation , citing its lack of a " significant preferential affirmative action program " and supposed lack of diversity .
The school stepped up its already - extensive recruitment efforts , but was forced to back away from its opposition to significant preferential treatment .
It was thus able to raise the proportion of minorities in its entering class to 10.98 % in 2001 and 16.16 % in 2002 .
An overweight America may be fixated on fat and obsessed with carbs , but nutritionists say the real problem is much sweeter -- we 're awash in sugar .
Not just any sugar , but high fructose corn syrup .
The country eats more sweetener made from corn than from sugarcane or beets , gulping it down in drinks as well as in frozen food and baked goods .
Even ketchup is laced with it .
Almost all nutritionists finger high fructose corn syrup consumption as a major culprit in the nation 's obesity crisis .
The inexpensive sweetener flooded the American food supply in the early 1980s , just about the time the nation 's obesity rate started its unprecedented climb .
The question is why did it make us so fat .
Is it simply the Big Gulp syndrome -- that we 're eating too many empty calories in ever - increasing portion sizes ?
Or does the fructose in all that corn syrup do something more insidious -- literally short - wire our metabolism and force us to gain weight ?
The debate can divide a group of nutritional researchers almost as fast as whether the low - carb craze is fact or fad .
Loading high fructose corn syrup into increasingly larger portions of soda and processed food has packed more calories into us and more money into food processing companies , say nutritionists and food activists .
But some health experts argue that the issue is bigger than mere calories .
The theory goes like this :
The body processes the fructose in high fructose corn syrup differently than it does old - fashioned cane or beet sugar , which in turn alters the way metabolic - regulating hormones function .
It also forces the liver to kick more fat out into the bloodstream .
The end result is that our bodies are essentially tricked into wanting to eat more and at the same time , we are storing more fat .
" One of the issues is the ease with which you can consume this stuff , " says Carol Porter , director of nutrition and food services at UC San Francisco .
" It 's not that fructose itself is so bad , but they put it in so much food that you consume so much of it without knowing it . "
A single 12 - ounce can of soda has as much as 13 teaspoons of sugar in the form of high fructose corn syrup .
And because the amount of soda we drink has more than doubled since 1970 to about 56 gallons per person a year , so has the amount of high fructose corn syrup we take in .
In 2001 , we consumed almost 63 pounds of it , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
The USDA suggests most of us limit our intake of added sugar -- that 's everything from the high fructose corn syrup hidden in your breakfast cereal to the sugar cube you drop into your after - dinner espresso -- to about 10 to 12 teaspoons a day .
But we 're not doing so well .
In 2000 , we ate an average of 31 teaspoons a day , which was more than 15 percent of our caloric intake .
And much of that was in sweetened drinks .
Beyond soda
So , the answer is to just avoid soda , right ?
Unfortunately , it 's not that simple , because the inexpensive , versatile sweetener has crept into plenty of other places -- foods you might not expect to have any at all .
A low - fat , fruit - flavored yogurt , for example , can have 10 teaspoons of fructose - based sweetener in one serving .
Because high fructose corn syrup mixes easily , extends shelf - life and is as much as 20 percent cheaper than other sources of sugar , large - scale food manufacturers love it .
It can help prevent freezer burn , so you 'll find it on the labels of many frozen foods .
It helps breads brown and keeps them soft , which is why hot dog buns and even English muffins hold unexpected amounts .
The question remains just how much more dangerous high fructose corn syrup is than other sugars .
Fructose , as the name implies , is the sugar found naturally in fruit .
It can be extracted , turned into granules and used like sugar in the kitchen .
It used to be considered a healthier alternative to sucrose -- plain old table sugar .
It 's sweeter , so less is needed to achieve the same taste .
Diabetics use it because fructose does n't stimulate insulin production , so blood sugar levels remain stable .
The process of pulling sugar from cornstarch was n't perfected until the early 1970s , when Japanese researchers developed a reliable way to turn cornstarch into syrup sweet enough to compete with liquid sugar .
After some tinkering , they landed on a formula that was 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose -- sweet enough and cheap enough to make most soda companies jump from liquid sugar to high fructose corn syrup by the 1980s .
The results were dramatic . -- a whopping increase of 4,080 percent .
Journalist Greg Critser lays out a compelling case against high fructose corn syrup in his 2003 book , " Fat Land : How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World . "
He argues that federal policies that aimed to stabilize food prices and support corn production in the 1970s led to a glut of corn and then to high fructose corn syrup .
With a cheaper way to sweeten food , producers pumped up the size and amount of sweet snacks and drinks on the market and increased profits .
It 's not natural
Critser writes that despite the food industry 's arguments that sugar is sugar , whether fructose or sucrose , no group " has yet refuted the growing scientific concern that , when all is said and done , fructose ... is about the furthest thing from natural that one can imagine , let alone eat . "
Although some researchers have long been suspicious that too much fructose can cause problems , the latest case against high fructose corn syrup began in earnest a few years ago .
Dr. George Bray , principal investigator of the Diabetes Prevention Program at Louisiana State University Medical Center told the International Congress on Obesity that in 1980 , just after high fructose corn syrup was introduced in mass quantities , relatively stable obesity rates began to climb .
By 2000 , they had doubled .
Further , the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2002 published research that showed that teenagers ' milk consumption between 1965 and 1996 decreased by 36 percent , while soda consumption increased by more than 200 percent .
Bray argues that without calcium , which nutritionists agree can help the body regulate weight , kids got fatter .
He says that he could find no other single combination of environmental or food changes that were as significant to the rise in obesity .
Other studies by researchers at UC Davis and the University of Michigan have shown that consuming fructose , which is more readily converted to fat by the liver , increases the levels of fat in the bloodstream in the form of triglycerides .
And unlike other types of carbohydrate made up of glucose , fructose does not stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin .
Peter Havel , a nutrition researcher at UC Davis who studies the metabolic effects of fructose , has also shown that fructose fails to increase the production of leptin , a hormone produced by the body 's fat cells .
Both insulin and leptin act as signals to the brain to turn down the appetite and control body weight .
And in another metabolic twist , Havel 's research shows that fructose does not appear to suppress the production of ghrelin , a hormone that increases hunger and appetite .
" Because fructose in isolation does n't activate the hormones that regulate body weight as do other types of carbohydrate composed of glucose , consuming a diet high in fructose could lead to taking in more calories and , over time , to weight gain , " he says .
However , Havel is n't convinced high fructose corn syrup is by itself the problem .
That 's in part because it is composed of 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose , which is similar to the 50 - 50 combination of fructose and glucose found in table sugar .
Havel 's studies have focused on fructose by itself and not as part of a high fructose corn syrup mixture .
" Whether there is an important difference in the effects of consuming beverages sweetened with a mixture of 55 percent as opposed to 50 percent fructose would be hard to measure , " he says .
" Additional studies are needed to better understand the nutritional impact of consuming different types of sugars in humans . "
Still , other researchers are finding new problems with high fructose corn syrup .
A study in last month 's Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggests that women whose diet was high in total carbohydrate and fructose intake had an increased risk of colorectal cancer .
And Dr. Mel Heyman , chief of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition at UCSF , is seeing sick children whose bodies have been overloaded with fructose from naturally occurring fructose in fruit juice combined with soda and processed food .
" The way the body handles glucose is different than fructose , " he says .
" It can overload the intestines ' ability to absorb carbohydrate by giving it too much fructose .
That can cause cramps , bloating and loose stools . "
The jury 's still out
Like others in the field , he says there is much to discover in how sugar works , but he disagrees that high fructose corn syrup is somehow reprogramming our bodies toward obesity .
Rather , he says , we 're just eating too much of it .
Nutrition theory holds that the basic make - up of fructose - laced corn syrup is not much different than table sugar .
They react about the same in the body , says Dr. Walter Willett , a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health .
" There are some modest differences in metabolism , but I do n't think fructose per se is the culprit . "
Neither do the food companies that use it in copious amounts .
Says Stephanie Childs , a spokesperson for the Grocery Manufacturers Association : " At the end of the day , how any sweetener affects your weight depends on how many calories you are taking in overall .
Overemphasizing one nutrient at the detriment of others is not going to solve the problem . "
Even some leading nutrition reformers are n't convinced that high fructose corn syrup is of itself the issue .
The bigger battle , says Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a consumer advocacy group , is to get added sugars listed on food labels with a percentage of daily value .
That means a consumer could look at a package and see that , for example , one soda provides almost all the sugar a person should eat in a day .
" It simply comes down to this , " he says .
" We 're eating too much refined sugars , be it sucrose or high fructose corn syrup or any other refined sugar . "

It should come as no shock to most consumers that a Pepsi or a Fig Newton has plenty of sugar - most of it from high fructose corn syrup .
But what 's surprising is the products where the sweetener hides out and how disguised it can be by the deceptively small serving size listed on the nutrition label .
Although the numbers below show teaspoons of sugar per serving , people often eat more than one serving .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture advises most people to limit themselves to 10 to 12 teaspoons of added sugars a day .
How much is too much ?
The list below shows how much sugar , mostly in the form of high fructose corn syrup , is in each of these single servings .
Sunkist soda : 10 1/2 teaspoons of sugar
Berkeley Farms low - fat yogurt with fruit : 10 teaspoons of sugar
Mott 's applesauce : 5 teaspoons of sugar
Slim - Fast chocolate cookie dough meal bar : 5 teaspoons of sugar

Edward R. Murrow must be turning over in his grave .
The once proud fourth estate has been so severely compromised that it virtually serves no purpose other than to assist corporate America continue it ’s stranglehold on the republic that once was the United States of America .
I have lamented for years now from this column the abuses of the corporate media .
The deterioration of the media under the Bush administration has been beyond palpable .
Deregulation has allowed near monopolistic situations as media no longer reports the news ; it packages the news .
We have seen the Jeff Gannon ’s of the world erode the validity of the press and fake news spots being produced by the government to convince you that what their opinion is , is really objective reporting .
In the last two presidential elections we saw how powerful the corporate media could be .
In 2000 we saw the media turn Al Gore into a liar , when in every case the alleged lies were a fabrication of the right wing echo chamber .
Bush was given a free pass in the debates by the press who turned the election into a contest of who you would rather have a beer with .
In 2004 we saw the corporate media turn Howard Dean into the scream , torpedoing his electoral hopes .
Then we saw the “ reporting ” of the swift boat nonsense as John Kerry , a war hero , was turned into Benedict Arnold .
Conversely , Bush was again given a free pass even though he was soundly trounced by Kerry in every debate .
Instead of talking about Iraq , we were talking about pictures of John Kerry windsurfing and how that must mean he is out of touch with mainstream America .
Fast forward to 2008 and we saw a fake news network be allowed to host republican presidential debates .
The result was nothing more than an hour and a half of right wing propaganda being presented as legitimate presidential issues .
I thought that the corporate media could go no lower .
Then I watched last night ’s debate on ABC .
You could see who was paying the bills from the first “ question ” last night .
Both candidates were asked to “ fight until the end for every delegate ” and then agree to put the other on the ticket as VP .
Now , who would benefit the most from the democratic primaries being dragged out until the last delegate is counted ?
John McCain of course .
This pseudo - question unfortunately was only the beginning of the onslaught against the collective intelligence of this country .
From that point on it became obvious that the agenda for the evening was to do as much damage to Barack Obama as possible .
Why you might ask ?
Two strategic reasons .
The first reason is to continue the democratic primaries as long as possible because as outlined , it only helps John McCain .
Hillary is trailing and trailing badly .
By hurting Obama , perhaps Hillary ’s chances get propped up and the primaries can continue as they beat each other up while McCain tours Iraq .
The secondary reason is that the machine does not want Obama as the democratic candidate .
Hillary is more owned and closer to Bush than Obama ever would be .
By ensuring it is Hillary - McCain the machine knows it will be a choice of Bush on steroids versus Bush Lite .
An Obama candidacy would present a far bigger challenge for the GOP and Diebold .
Want proof ?
Here are some of the “ questions ” asked of Barack Obama last night :
1 ) Talking to a closed - door fundraiser in San Francisco 10 days ago , you got talking in California about small - town Pennsylvanians who have had tough economic times in recent years .
And you said they get bitter , and they cling to guns or they cling to their religion or they cling to antipathy toward people who are not like them .
Now , you 've said you misspoke ; you said you mangled what it was you wanted to say .
But we 've talked to a lot of voters .
Do you understand that some people in this state find that patronizing and think that you said actually what you meant ?
Who is writing this question Sean Hannity ?
First of all , it is not what Obama said .
He said that people in small town America often vote against their economic interests and instead cling to religion etal .
The last two lines of the question are actually republican talking points !
The “ question ” essentially accuses Obama of being patronizing and a liar !
Then the moderator allowed Senator Clinton to “ weigh in ” on the bashing of her opponent !
2 ) The next two questions to Clinton ask her if she thinks Obama can actually beat John McCain .
That is followed by asking Obama is he thinks Clinton can beat McCain .
Is this a presidential debate or an infomercial selling us on how electable John McCain is ?
3 ) Senator Obama , since you last debated , you made a significant speech in this building on the subject of race and your former pastor , the Reverend Jeremiah Wright .
And you said subsequent to giving that speech that you never heard him say from the pulpit the kinds of things that so have offended people .
But more than a year ago , you rescinded the invitation to him to attend the event when you announced your candidacy .
He was to give the invocation .
And according to the reverend , I 'm quoting him ; you said to him , " You can get kind of rough in sermons .
So what we 've decided is that it 's best for you not to be out there in public . "
I 'm quoting the reverend .
But what did you know about his statements that caused you to rescind that invitation ?
And if you knew he got rough in sermons , why did it take you more than a year to publicly disassociate yourself from his remarks ?
Flogging the dead horse issue that is Jeremiah Wright .
Not a question about the economy , Iraq , or anything relevant to the election .
Instead , more right - wingnut talking points regurgitated by shills posing as journalists .

PA Gov. Ed Rendell on Fox News coverage of the Democratic primary campaign …
I think during this entire primary coverage , starting in Iowa and up to the present — FOX has done the fairest job , and remained the most objective of all the cable networks .
You hate both of our candidates .
No , Iâm only kidding .
But you actually have done a very balanced job of reporting the news , and some of the other stations are just caught up with Senator Obama , who is a great guy , but Senator Obama can do no wrong , and Senator Clinton can do no right .
Diamonds and gold — vast natural resources that could enrich a nation — are a curse in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where the Congolese people have suffered the largest death toll since the second world war .
The conflict between warlords and armed rebels for control of these resources have plunged the citizens into a life of poverty , sexual violence , and war .
Some 45,000 people die each month as a result .
The actual miners who extract the sought - out treasures have no access to a living wage , societal safety , or simple medical care , while their leaders enrich themselves and allow the misery to continue .
Marcus Bleasdale traces how the west 's consumer appetite for these resources have led to such sub - human conditions for the Congolese , and poses that we might make a difference — at the jewelry counter — simply by asking : where does that ring come from ?

The ants in these photographs have fallen victim to parasitic fungi which manipulate the behaviour of their host in order to increase their own chances of reproducing .
The spores of the fungus attach themselves to the external surface of the ant , where they germinate .
They then enter the ant ’s body through the tracheae ( the tubes through which insects breathe ) , via holes in the exoskeleton called spiracles .
Fine fungal filaments called mycelia then start to grow inside the ant ’s body cavity , absorbing the host ’s soft tissues but avoiding its vital organs .
When the fungus is ready to sporulate , the mycelia grow into the ant ’s brain .
The fungus then produces chemicals which act on the host ’s brain and alter its perception of pheromones .
This causes the ant to climb a plant and , upon reaching the top , to clamp its mandibles around a leaf or leaf stem , thus securing it firmly to what will be its final resting place .
The fungus then devours the ant ’s brain , killing the host .
The fruiting bodies of the fungus sprout from the ant ’s head , through gaps in the joints of the exoskeleton .
Once mature , the fruiting bodies burst , releasing clusters of capsules into the air .
These in turn explode on their descent , spreading airborne spores over the surrounding area .
These spores then infect other ants , completing the life cycle of the fungus .
Depending on the type of fungus and the number of infecting spores , death of an infected insect takes between 4 - 10 days .
The carpenter ant in the photograph on the right has been infected by Cordyceps unilateralis , which is but one of thousands of species of entomopathogenic fungi , more than 400 of which belong to the Cordyceps genus .
Between them , these parasitic fungi infect at least nine different orders of arthropods , including the Odonata ( dragonflies and damselflies ) , Blattaria ( cockroaches ) , Hemiptera ( aphids , cicadas and leafhoppers ) , Coleoptera ( beetles ) , Phasmida ( stick insects ) , Hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) , and Lepidoptera ( butterflies and moths ) .
The host range of an individual species is , however , restricted to one species or to a small number of closely related species .
Because they are considered as environmentally safe , natural mortality agents , entomopathogenic fungi are used as biological pesticides to control pest species .
For example , Metarhizium anisopliae was first used over 100 years ago to try and control the wheat grain beetle Anisoplia austriaca .
More recently , researchers have investigated the use of Metarhizium anisopliae , a species which infects the African mosquito Anopheles gambiae , to control the spread of malaria .
Entomopathogenic fungi are not the only parasites that can modify the behaviour of their hosts .
Equally remarkable is the nematomorph hairworm Spinochordodes tellinii , which is also known as the horsehair worm or the gordian worm , because of its resemblance to the knot created by the Phrygian king Gorius .
( According to myth , Gordius used his knot to tie a chariot to a pole , and declared that whoever could untie it would rule all of Asia . )
The juvenile gordian worm parasitizes land - living arthropods such as grasshopers , locusts and beetles , but the adult is a free - living aquatic species which can only reproduce in water .
Inside the host , the microscopic larvae feed on surrounding tissue , and develop into long worms which can reach up to 4 times the length of the host , and which remain within the body cavity of the host as a long , coiled mass .
After metamorphosing , the adult worm induces its host to leave its terrestrial habitat , and to commit suicide by jumping into water and drowning itself , so that the worm can emerge .
David Biron and his colleagues have used proteomics to characterise the proteins synthesized by the gordian worm in order to determine how it manipulates its host ’s behaviour .
They have established that the worm synthesizes proteins which mimic those produced by the insect .
These include proteins of the Wnt family , which are involved in the development of the nervous system , as well as others which interfere with the neurotransmitter systems involved in the host ’s geotactic behaviour ( its oriented movements in relation to the Earth ’s magnetic field ) .
Because the genes encoding these proteins are contained in the worm ’s genome , but have a direct effect on the insect ’s central nervous system when they are expressed , the relationship between the gordian worm and its host is an example of what Richard Dawkins called the extended phenotype , whereby genes expressed by one organism have an effect on the appearance or behaviour of another .
( Entomopathogenic fungi and their hosts are also an example of an extended phenotype . )
Incredibly , the gordian worm can survive predation on its host .
Parasites use various strategies to survive host predation .
For example , some develop quickly , in order to emerge from the host before it is preyed upon .
Grasshoppers and crickets are preyed upon by fish and frogs ; the gordian worm can escape this predation by wriggling out of the mouth , nose or gills of the predator once it has emerged from a host that has been eaten .

Two years ago , top economists here at the Federal Reserve 's annual conference praised Alan Greenspan as possibly the greatest central banker ever .
This year , several suggested his Fed helped spur the current meltdown in credit and mortgage markets by cutting interest rates too much and regulating too little .
Analysts were divided , however , on whether the turmoil , and downward spiral in the housing market , would push the United States into recession .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech Friday that it is not the central bank 's job to bail out individual investors , but that it would do what is needed to limit broader economic harm from the recent seize - up of credit markets and the potential for a deeper housing fall .
Harvard economist Martin Feldstein said housing woes pose a triple threat to the economy with a collapse in construction , slower spending by consumers less able to tap home equity and tougher lending standards .
He suggested the Fed might have to cut a key interest rate as much as a percentage point from the current 5.25 % .
That could support employment , help borrowers with adjustable - rate loans and shore up other markets .
On the downside , it could fuel inflation and aid people who made bad business decisions .
" It would be a mistake to permit a serious economic downturn just to avoid helping those ( market ) participants , " Feldstein said .
UCLA economist Edward Leamer argued the Fed should pay more attention to real estate , saying a housing downturn foreshadowed almost every recent U.S. recession .
Still , he added , recession is not inevitable , in part because manufacturing is not likely to lose as many jobs as in past downturns .
Leamer said the Fed may have laid the groundwork for the housing bust and credit market turmoil by cutting interest rates too low earlier in the decade .
It 's " best to remember that the teaser rates for ( adjustable - rate ) mortgages came from Washington , D.C. , not from Wall Street , " Leamer said .
Stanford economist John Taylor also suggested that the Fed sharpened the housing boom and bust by keeping interest rates too low from 2003 to 2006 .
He noted the Fed was acting in a complex financial environment and that long - term rates did not rise as much as expected when it did tighten .
Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin argued that the central bank should not give housing an elevated role in policy or try to pop asset bubbles .
Still , Mishkin said , the Fed should be prepared to act quickly to ensure falling housing prices do n't seriously damage the broad economy .

正規表現はお好き ?
積んであった Beautiful Code を読んでみる .
第一章はカーニハンによる正規表現の話 .
数十行のコードで簡単な正規表現を実装してみせる.
パターン文字列を内部表現に変換せずマッチに使うぜ , コードも短い , ビューティホー ! ...という主張なのだが , それはほんとにビューティホーなのか .
UNIX 人の感覚にはついていけない .
それにしても彼らは正規表現が好きだ. いつものその話ばかりしている. artu はいうまでもなく プログラミング作法 にも正規表現が出てきた .
まったくこのマンネリめ .
そう斜に構えつつ読み直してみると , 案外ラディカルな話も載っているのに気付く.
9.7 " オンザフライコンパイル " より :
Ken Thompson はまさにこの方法によって 1967 年に IBM7094 上に正規表現を実装した .
彼のバージョンは , 正規表現に含まれる様々な処理を小さなブロック単位の7094バイナリ命令とし生成し , それらを互いに組合せたものを通常の関数のように呼び出すことによって
プログラムを実行するようになっていた.
正規表現で JIT !
かっこいい. しかも 40 年前. UNIX の先人はエラかった .
ちょっとくらいマンネリでもいい. 私もその敏腕にあやかりたい .
llre : LLVM で JIT つき正規表 現
そんなわけで JIT つき正規表現をつくってみた .
( hg , ブラウズ , スナップショット )
正規表現の機能は minimum なので実用には耐えない .
対応しているもの : アルファベット , 数字 , " * " , " | " , カッコ , エスケープ , epsilon 対応していないものの例 : マルチバイト文字 , " ? " , " + " , " ^ " , " $ " , " . " , 文字クラス , そのほか ...
サンプルとしてしょぼい grep もどきを添 付
JIT はしたいけど x86 の仕様を調べるのが辛い現代っ子の私は LLVM を頼った .
LLVM からとりだした関数ポインタを呼び出しマッチが動く瞬間はちょっと感動.
Thompson , オレやったよ .
ベンチマー ク
JIT でどのくらい速くなったかベンチマークをとってみよう .
まずテスト用に作ったインタプリタと比較する.
これより遅いとまずい .
こんなかんじで :
# benchmark.sh PATTERN_LLGREP= " \/\/\ *( TODO|FIXME ) " # コメント行に TODO か FIXME が含まれる for i in `jot 10 1` ; do # - i でインタプリタモードに .
find ~/src/boost_1_33_1/ - name " *.cpp " - or - name " *.hpp " | xargs ./ llgrep - i -q -v " $ { PATTERN_LLGREP} " done
ためす :
$ time sh benchmark.sh real 0m58.354s user 0m38.798s sys 0m5.435s
JIT で動かすと ...
$ vi benchmark.sh # - i オプションを消す $ time sh benchmark.sh real 0m36.370s user 0m16.869s sys 0m5.423s
1.6 倍か. うーん...遅くはないけど苦労の割に速くないなあ.
ただ boost のファイルは全部で 6000 近くあるから , ファイル開閉のオーバーヘッドが気になる .
そこで , まず対象のファイルをひとつにまとめる .
$ find ~/src/boost_1_33_1 / - name " *.cpp " - or - name " *.hpp " | xargs cat >> boost_cat.cpp $wc boost_cat.cpp 875578 2892653 28791016 boost_cat.cpp
87 万行 , 28 MB のファイルができた .
これで測りなおそう .
スクリプトは同じ .
PATTERN_LLGREP= " \/\/\ *( TODO|FIXME ) " A_FILE=boost_cat.cpp for i in `jot 10 1` ; do ./llgrep - i -q -v " $ { PATTERN_LLGREP} " $ {A_FILE} done
インタプリタ :
$ time sh ./benchmark.sh real 0m25.514s user 0m25.093s sys 0m0.391s
JIT :
$ time sh ./benchmark.sh real 0m3.556s user 0m3.166s sys 0m0.377s
7.2 倍! このくらい速いなら JIT した甲斐もあるよね .
grep との比 較
ついでに grep とも比べてみた .
正規表現を grep 用になおして ...
PATTERN_GREP= " // *\( TODO \|FIXME \ ) " A_FILE=boost_cat.cpp for i in `jot 10 1` ; do grep -q " $ { PATTERN_GREP} " $ {A_FILE} done
実行 .
$ time sh ./benchmark.sh real 0m0.102s user 0m0.050s sys 0m0.045s
うは! 35 倍って... ちなみに xargs 版は 9 倍 .
$ time sh ./benchmark.sh real 0m4.098s user 0m2.416s sys 0m1.398s
なんでこんなに速いんだ .
精神的ダメージのあまり GNU grep のコードを覗いてみることに .
( 私はマカーなの で BSD grep で実験しているけれど , 試してみると GNU grep も同じくらい速かった . )
grep は正規表現を DFA にコンパイルし , 状態マシンとして動作する .
dragon book をコピっただけの llre も大枠では同じアルゴリムに倣っている .
なのに性能差 35 倍... 実行時のホットスポットである状態遷移ループを見てみよう.
/* from dfa.c : マルチバイト対応部などは省略 */ size_t dfaexec ( struct dfa *d , char const * begin , size_t size , int * backref ) { ... s = 0 ; p = ( unsigned char const *) begin ; end = p + size ; trans = d-> trans ; /* trasn はアルファベットを索引とする dfa の遷移表 */ for ( ; ; ) { while ( ( t = trans [ s ] ) )
/* このループがメインの状態遷移 */ s = t[*p++ ] ; /* 遷移配列がない : 遷移できないハズレ状態を引いた? */ if ( s < 0 ) { /* * 一度もマッチすることなくハズレ状態に遷移した場合はリジェクト .
* 最初の状態から再開 . ( 終端なら失敗 ) * p はこのままでいいんだろうか ?
* llre は保守的に前回の一文字次まで戻している ... */ if ( p == end ) { return ( size_t ) - 1 ; } s = 0 ; } else if ( ( t = d-> fails [s ] ) ) { /* 直前は受理状態だった ? */ if ( d -> success [s ] & sbit [ * p ] ) { /* offset を返す . * ポインタは進みすぎてる気がするけど grep 的には問題ない */ if ( backref ) * backref = ( d -> states [s ] .
backref != 0 ) ; return ( char const *) p - begin ; } /* 潜在的な受理状態が続く : * d-> fails がもうひとつの遷移表として使われている ( ややこしすぎる ... ) */ s = t[ * p++ ] ; } else { /* 遷移配列がまだない .
再構築してリトライ */ build_state(s , d ) ; trans = d-> trans ; } } }
中心となるループが単純な二段の配列ルックアップに収まっている.
なかなかビューティホー.
llre のループは lex が出力するコードのような二段の switch 文. ここだけ見てもだいぶ差がありそうだとわかる.
ビューティー度も劣る . また llre では文字列の先頭からマッチを判断する match ( ) を実装し , grep のように部分一致を探す search ( ) は match ( ) を使って実装している. grep は search ( ) に特化しており無駄がない .
こりゃ 35 倍速くても不思議じゃないかも...
grep はこのほかにも細かな高速化を行っている .
たとえばパターンが単一文字列の時は Boyer - Moore を , 複数文字列のセットの時は trie を使う .
長い時間をかけて鍛えられたコードの貫禄がある.
正規表現 VM たち
ついでに他の実装も覗こうと 鬼車 , PCRE , ORO を眺めた .
偶然なのか , これらには共通の特徴がある .
どれも正規表現をバイトコードにコンパイルし , 内部の VM がそれを実行するのだ .
おどろき. 正規表現というのは DFA に変換して状態マシンにするものだと思っていた .
状態マシンが入力文字列をイテレートして処理を進めるのに対し , VM 実装はバイトコードの命令列が処理を駆動する .
スタック( の配列 ) があって PC ( のローカル変数 ) もある. アーキテクチャが全然違う .
正規表現 VM にどんな命令セットを用意すべきか私には見当もつかない.
それでも実際の opcode をみると , 色々と納得するところはある .
perl や ruby など , 世の中の正規表現はプリミティブな正規表現を大きく拡張している .
そうした拡張は理論上どれもプリミティブな表現に変換できる構文糖だとされている.
しかし実際には変換なしに解釈した方がずっと効率よく動かせるものもある.
たとえば " [ : alpha : ] " は " ( a|b|c | . ... ) " に変換できるが , テーブルを引く関数 isalpha ( ) を使った方が速いだろう .
それに対象の文字セットが大きいと , " ( あ|い | ... ) " と変換するのがそもそも現実的でない. " . " なんて目もあてられない .
もう一つの例としては " x + " がある. これを " xx * " に変換すると " x " を複製する必要がある . " + "
をそのまま解釈できれば内部表現を小さくできるかもしれない.
{m , n} もおなじ .
このように , 拡張を直接解釈する潜在的なメリットは大きい .
しかし状態マシンにこれらの拡張を組み込もうとすると事態が複雑になるだろうと察しがつく.
DFA のアルファベット集合をどう表現するか , firstpos や followpos の計算は ?
そんなややこしい問題を抱えながら DFA に変換するくらいなら , いっそ正規表現を言語とみなしてコンパイルしてしまおう.
そう考えるのはアリかもと思えてくる.
命令主導の制御構造と相性のいい高速化もある.
たとえば鬼車には OP_EXACTN
という opcode があり , operand で指定された長さの文字列と入力の文字列をマッチする .
/* regexec.c:match_at( ) */ ... case OP_EXACTN : MOP_IN ( OP_EXACTN ) ; GET_LENGTH_INC ( tlen , p ) ; DATA_ENSURE ( tlen ) ; while ( tlen -- > 0 ) { if ( * p++ != *s++) goto fail ; } sprev = s - 1 ; MOP_OUT ; continue ; ...
これは文字単位でループを駆動する状態マシンだとやりにくい仕組みだと思う.
鬼車にはこの亜種で OP_EXACT1 ... OP_EXACT5 が用意されており , 五文字までの文字列は比較のループがアンロールされていたりする.
がんばってるなー .
なお VM ベースのエンジンは基本的に NFA 的なマッチを行う .
後方参照や部分マッチのとりだしを実現するにはその方が楽だからだという.
Russ Cox による " Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast " という記事では特定のパターンで見せる大きな性能低下を根拠に
NFA ベースの実装を批判し , NFA と DFA のハイブリッドなアルゴリズムを紹介している .
この記事で は PCRE 6.4 を遅いライブラリのひとつとして槍玉に上げている.
私の見た最新版の PCRE 7.4 ではこの批判を受けて ... かどうかはさておき , DFA のハイブリッドアルゴリズムも実装していた . ( pcre_dfa_exec.c ) この実装は一つ面白い特徴がある : pcre_dfa_match ( ) は NFA 実装である pcre_exec ( ) と同じバイトコードを解釈する .
言ってみれば PCRE には一つのバイトコードを動かす二種類の VM が入っている .
Cox の記事は NFA の状態グラフを使って DFA を実行する話だった .
PCRE はそれをうまく VM の仕組みに取り入れている .
ビューティホーだと思う .
最速の正規表現ライブラリがあるなら
これだけ VM スタイルの実装が幅を利かせているところをみると , JIT つき正規表現もそう悪くない気がしてくる .
VM の高速化といえば JIT でしょ .
評価ループが消えるだけでなく , 細かなオプションでの分岐や文字コード関係の多態もコンパイル時に解決できる.
VM の JIT 化には夢があるなあ .
35 倍の大敗を喫した llre だけれど , これは JIT が悪いのではなく私の実装がへぼいだけ...だよね , Thompson ?
I remember when I saw my first double - neck guitar , I was really impressed .
That seemed like a huge thing to have hanging from your neck .
They became really popular in the Led Zeppelin , Yes and The Who era .
The idea is to have 2 guitars handy , like a 6 - string and a 12 - string , or a bass and a guitar , a fretted and a fretless bass , or 2 guitars in a different tuning .
But obviously it ’s also one of those macho ‘ size - matters ’ things .
The guitarist with the double - neck here is Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin .
There ’s more , of course : e.g. Steve Vai has played the triple - neck heart - shaped monster you see on the side .
Today , triple neck guitars are still rare , because they ’re huge , heavy , expensive and utterly pointless .
They ’re an obscene symbol of self - indulgence , like Missy Elliot ’s Lamborghini bed , or Snoop ’s jewel - encrusted crunk cup .
( from : Engadget )
King of the hill : the quintuple - neck guitar , used by Cheap Trick ’s Rick Nielsen .
That is : 36 strings ( 4 guitars and a 12 string ) .

WASHINGTON 
It could be payback time .
An expensive legal and political campaign last year by Microsoft helped delay completion of Google ’s $ 3.1 billion bid for the online advertising company DoubleClick .
Microsoft filed briefs against the deal in the United States and abroad , testified against it in Congress , and worked with a public relations firm to generate opposition .
Now Google is preparing to strike back .
With Microsoft bidding nearly $ 45 billion to buy Yahoo , Google has begun to lay the groundwork to try to delay , and possibly derail , any deal .
Google executives have asked company lobbyists to develop a political strategy to challenge the acquisition , which could threaten Google ’s dominance of Internet advertising .
Google ’s top legal officer posted a statement Sunday that criticized the proposed deal .
Spokesmen for the two companies in Washington declined to comment Monday about a looming legal and political battle , which has yet to fully emerge and is likely to stay below the radar at least until the control of Yahoo seems clear .
Moreover , some antitrust specialists and government officials said Google might tread carefully in opposing any deal since it could backfire .
年明け早々，ゲームに対する批判的な動きが活発になりそうな，いくつかのニュースが話題になっている。これには，大統領の予備選挙が始まり，ゲームを法律で規制しようとする動きが，普段より目立つことも関係しているようだ。おかしな法律ができないよう祈りつつ，今回はそれらのニュースを紹介していこう。
ゲームを言い訳にする犯罪者達
NBC系列テレビ局WSOC のインターネットニュースは，1月7日に8台の車と一軒の空き家に火をつけて回った3人の少年が逮捕されたと報じた（関連記事）。その記事によると，警察は「 Postal 2」の影響が見られると語ったという。そしてこの記事は，「 Police Say Violent Video Game Inspired Teen Arson Spree 」 （10代による放火は，暴力ゲームが影響と警察が発表）というタイトルになっていた。だが，捕まった3人が，どの程度Postal 2をプレイしていたかといったことにはまったく触れられていない。
主犯格と見られる少年には，過去に放火容疑で逮捕された経歴があるので，ゲームの影響よりも，その少年がほかの2名に影響を与えたと考える方が自然ではないだろうか。
ちなみに，この3人は放火の前に車上荒らしも行っており，20件あまりの罪状で立件されると見られている。筆者はPostal 2をプレイしたことがあるが，車上荒らしをするようなシーンに出会った記憶はない。なんの根拠もなく警察がゲームタイトルの名前を挙げるとは考えづらく，おそらく少年達の供述に基づいた発表ということだろうが，特定のタイトルを名指しで報道するにしては，ややお粗末な発表と言わざるを得ない。
また ，Walker County Messengerのオンライン版によると，1月1日にジョージア州ラファイアット市で起きた放火事件の容疑者は，映画「ファイトクラブ」と，一般的には暴力ゲームとして認識されていないスケボーゲーム「 Tony Hawk's Underground 2」の影響を受けたと語っている。
確かに ，Tony Hawk's Underground 2 に はDestruction Tourという，街中の建物を破壊するたびにポイントが加算されていくモードはあるが，本作にも放火の真似事のような描写はない。
罪を犯した少年達は，言い訳としてゲームの影響を挙げることで社会的な同情を誘い，少しでも罪を軽くしてもらおうと考えているように思える。そういった言い訳を，ゲームに詳しくないメディアが鵜呑みにして報道することで，ゲームの世間的なイメージの更なる低下を招くという構図である。ゲームが犯罪に何ひとつ影響を与えていないとは言い切れないが，犯罪者の言い訳を，安易にゲームに結び付けて報道してほしくはないものだ。
ゲーム業界を攻撃する企業と協力する企業
さて，犯罪事件とは別に，ゲーム業界に火の粉が飛んできそうな主張をしているのがMcDonald's
Corporation（マクドナルド）である。McDonald's Corporationのイギリス支社のCEO，Steve Easterbrook（スティーブ・イースターブルック）氏は，TIMES誌のイギリス版が特集した，青少年の間で増加傾向にある肥満に関して書かれた記事の中で，以下のように答えている。
「 肥満というのは我々の社会が抱える大きな問題であり，非常に複雑な問題です。どのような食生活を送り，自己管理していくべきか教育していくことが重要でしょう。また，ほかの要素としては，ライフスタイルの変化も挙げられます。町から緑のあるスペースが減り，子供達は外で遊んでエネルギーを消化する代わりに“テレビの前に座って，ゲームで遊んでばかりいる”ことも問題でしょう」
ゲームを使って肥満問題に取り組むのは，「 Dance Dance Revolution」を体育に導入したアメリカだけではない。メキシコ政府とPepsiCoは，共同で食育ゲームを開発すると発表した
イースターブルック氏の言いたいことは分からないでもないが，彼ほどの地位にある人物が，ファーストフードと肥満の関わりについて質問されているときに，ほかの産業へ矛先を向けるのは良い選択ではないだろう。とくに近年のマクドナルドは，NINTENDOやSEGAなどと組んで，ゲーム関連グッズとのタイアップを繰り返している。プロモーションにゲームを利用しておきながら，都合の悪いことは押しつけるという姿勢はいかがなものだろうか。
これに絡んで面白いニュースもある。ペプシコーラを製造するPepsiCoのメキシコ本部では，政府と協力して，健康的な食習慣を学べる「たまごっち」のような携帯式ゲームを開発していくというのだ。肥満の原因の一つとして挙げられることが多いソーダ飲料が主力プロダクトのPepsiCoが，こういった事業に取り組んでいくというのは皮肉に聞こえるかも知れない。しかし，メキシコでは飲用に使える水が少なく，ソーダやジュースを飲まなければならない地域もあるのだという。ゲームが，PepsiCoとメキシコ政府の思惑通り，子供達の意識改革の手助けになってくれることを期待したい。
当連載の第131回：社会貢献が目立ち始めたゲーム産業などでもお伝えしたが，ゲームを教育などに役立てようとする動きは増えてきており，成果をあげているプロジェクトもある。だが，こういったニュースよりも，ゲームの影響で罪を犯したといった話題のほうが目立っているような気がする。ネガティブな話題のほうが視聴率/部数/PVなどを稼ぎやすいという事情もあるのだろうが，一方的に悪として責任を押し付けることのないよう，できる限り公平に報道してもらいたいものだ。
Jennifer Aniston 's actor father JOHN has reportedly suffered a heart attack .
American publication Life +
Style reports in its new issue that the actress heard the news about her father 's health crisis last Friday ( 18AUG06 ) and spent much of the weekend ( 19/20AUG06 ) at his bedside .
US soap star John , 73 , is recovering at West Hills Hospital + Medical Center in California .
A family insider tells the publication , " It was a scary few hours before Jen got definitive word from doctors that her dad would be fine . "
Life +
Style reports Jennifer 's boyfriend Vince Vaughn proved to be a great support throughout the weekend , dropping a number of commitments to be with her .
The family source says , " He cancelled several appointments and stayed by her side .
" I do n't think Jen is ever going to forget what a stand - up guy Vince was and how he really stuck by her just when she needed him the most . "
Aniston 's representatives have refused to respond to a request for comment .
By now you have probably seen a bunch of talk about Twitter .
And after all of this talk you might be still thinking : OK , so what the heck is Twitter really and why should I care ?
How is it going to help my business at the end of the day ?
Rather than writing this column myself , I decided to let Twitter ( or more specifically , my extended Twitter network ) write it for me .
This is me on Twitter ( feel free to add me ) .
So let ’s get started …
The best way to demonstrate the usefulness or power of something is to show real examples .
I started this experiment at approximately 5:20 PM EST on Monday afternoon .
Within 1 hour , I had over 80 different replies that answered all of my questions and more .
Within 1 hour I had reached out to people from all over the world and they had reached back .
It all started with this simple question : “ How would you describe twitter in 140 characters or less ? ”
Below are some of the answers .
If you are interested in engaging with active people on Twitter – I would suggest following these folks .
They are there for the conversation and to give back .
In the end , that ’s what it ’s all about …
BrettfromTibet : Twitter is where instant messaging meets social networking
rabeidoh : Twitter is IM on hyperdrive .
Instead of reaching only one person , you can interact with thousands .
thomsinger : Twitter is an experience only understood once experienced .
It is both blog and IM rolled into an addictive communal ritual
Rhea :
My tiny blog , but posts and comments get lumped with everyone ’s .
News , gossip , personal , fun finds ;
Twitter is my brain dump .
dedmond29 : for me : conversations , insights , information and discoveries .
The more I contribute , the more I get back .
audette unparalleled access to influencers & colleagues , economy of words makes value easy to distinguish , and it ’s pretty damn fun !
lauracallow is an interactive online playground for the socially connected where rapid fire communications are inspired , shared & stored .
Honorable mention to the cheeky ciaranj : Twitter is a mix of kind of cool , really ?
WTF ?
& insanely interesting
OK – that was a great start .
And there were many more excellent answers but I think that gives you five very different overviews of Twitter .
Do n’t forget – every message you write on Twitter forces you to keep it under 140 characters .
So you have to try to get your point across clearly & succinctly .
Since this idea was for based around my Search Engine Land column , I thought : “ How can Twitter help marketers ? ”
Because let ’s face it – if it ’s not something useful for your business , we should n’t be talking about it here .
brianmark
It can open a conversation between marketers and customers with little effort .
KeriMorgret Easy way to get informal research .. either direct questions , or by watching what people say about your brand / product area .

Views , votes , comments , retweets , and more help spread seeds .
Honorable mention to the cheeky willcritchlow : by distracting their competitors …
OK , but is there any real business being done on here ?
Are conversions happening ?
If not – who cares , right ?
So I asked “ Have you ever bought anything because of Twitter ? ” bonus points for : what ? :) ”

Webhosting based on a twitter poll i sent out a month or so back … went with gate.com
brianchappell Dell 22 inch lcd .
they have a twitter account and announce discount codes .
jenstar
Well , does getting a product recommendation count ?
I ’m buying a speciifc headset because @oilman and @rossdunn recommended it
Frozen2 Late I followed @amazondeals and ended up ordering discounted tea after I saw a tweet .
kid_disco
Yep , I did buy a $ 100 + mouse thanks to @KeriMorgret ‘s suggestion via Twitter …
Honorable mention to the cheeky coplandmj :
No , although I ’d buy my soul back from Twitter if I could .
Personally I had already seen how Twitter could easily drive purchases .
Here ’s a quick example .
I needed a way to hook up my laptop to a third monitor .
I had the monitor sitting on my desk at my house and the guys at my local chain electronics store were completely clueless ( they had something if I wanted to hook up two computers to one monitor ) .
Then one day I was at a conference and I saw this message from Li Evans :
Then this follow - up from Avi Wilensky :
Now Avi is someone who I trust and who knows his stuff .
Within about 5 minutes I ordered the adapter from USB Gear and got it within 3 days .
It did n’t matter if that was a client , his own website , or something completely unrelated to him .
He had made a recommendation for something I needed ( without even knowing it ) and it filled my need at the perfect moment .
To me that ’s one of the most powerful things that Twitter brings to the table .
So how do you find out about opportunities like that ?
What are the tools that make it easier ?
That was my final question for the night : “ What is the best tool you have used to track buzz or conversations on twitter ? ”
kensavage Google blog search has to be the best and search.technorati.com a distant 2nd
tonyadam you can setup the “ track ” feature in twitter similar to how you would google alerts , e.g. “ track 10e20 ” .
scottclark Summize + RSS + Feedreader … blogged about that last week .
http://snurl.com/2681l
dewaldp Tracking buzz : TweetScan.com , twitter.summize.com , and the “ track ” feature of Twitter in GTalk .
Honorable mention to charlyjl
Are there tools ?
I ’ll have to read your column !
lol
So there you have it .
A post written by Twitter .

The Honorable John D. Rockefeller IV , Chairman
The United States Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence
Washington , DC 20510
The Honorable Christopher S. Bond , Vice Chairman
The United States Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence
Washington , DC 20510
Dear Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond :
As retired military leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces , we write to express our strong support for Section 327 of the Conference Report on the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 , H.R. 2082 .
Section 327 would require intelligence agents of the U.S. government to adhere to the standards of prisoner treatment and interrogation contained in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Human Collector Operations ( the Army Field Manual ) .
We believe it is vital to the safety of our men and women in uniform that the United States not sanction the use of interrogation methods it would find unacceptable if inflicted by the enemy against captured Americans .
That principle , embedded in the Army Field Manual , has guided generations of American military personnel in combat .
The current situation , in which the military operates under one set of interrogation rules that are public and the CIA operates under a separate , secret set of rules , is unwise and impractical .
In order to ensure adherence across the government to the requirements of the Geneva Conventions and to maintain the integrity of the humane
treatment standards on which our own troops rely , we believe that all U.S. personnel – military and civilian – should be held to a single standard of humane treatment reflected in the Army Field Manual .
The Field Manual is the product of decades of practical experience and was updated in 2006 to reflect lessons learned from the current conflict .
Interrogation methods authorized by the Field Manual have proven effective in eliciting vital intelligence from dangerous enemy prisoners .
Some have argued that the Field Manual rules are too simplistic for civilian interrogators .
We reject that argument .
Interrogation methods authorized in the Field Manual are sophisticated and flexible .
And the principles reflected in the Field Manual are values that no U.S. agency should violate .
General David Petraeus underscored this point in an open letter to the troops in May in which he cautioned against the use of interrogation techniques not authorized by the Field Manual :
What sets us apart from our enemies in this fight .
. . . is how we behave .
In everything we do , we must observe the standards and values that dictate that we treat noncombatants and detainees with dignity and respect ..
Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy .
They would be wrong .
Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal , history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary .
Certainly , extreme physical action can make someone " talk ; " however , what the individual says may be of questionable value .
In fact , our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual ( 2- 22.3 ) on Human Intelligence Collector Operations that was published last year shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees .
Employing interrogation methods that violate the Field Manual is not only unnecessary , but poses enormous risks .
These methods generate information of dubious value , reliance upon which can lead to disastrous consequences .
Moreover , revelation of the use of such techniques does immense damage to the reputation and moral authority of the United States essential to our efforts to combat terrorism .
This is a defining issue for America .
We urge you to support the adoption of Section 327 of the Conference Report and thereby send a clear message – to U.S. personnel and to the world – that the United States will not engage in or condone the abuse of prisoners and will honor its commitments to uphold the Geneva Conventions .
Sincerely ,

The Perverse Appeal of LOST
This post contains no spoilers .
The Queen and I are halfway through season three of LOST and goddamn I love this show .
It 's hard for me to admit because LOST is popular , and it 's crucial to my self - image that I only enjoy television shows that hobble along for a season or three , unappreciated by the unwashed masses , before getting unceremoniously axed .
Freaks & Geeks , Arrested Development , Firefly , and so forth .
( We are going to conveniently ignore that I also liked The Sopranos , and that I laugh until my stomach hurts every time I stumble across AFHV ...)
And yet here I am , a LOST junkie , just like half of America .
Intellectually I recognize that the third season has all of the same problems of the first two : it shows us the trees , so to speak , and willfully ignores the forest .
In other words , the creators of LOST have inverted the traditional mystery formula by making the clues themselves the focus of the show , instead of using them as an means to a end ( the end being the solution of the central mystery ) .
Here 's a hypothetical example ( hypothetical in the sense that I just made all this up ; again , no spoilers in this post . )
An episode ends with someone on LOST finding a leather - bound tome entitled " Secrets of the Island . "
Yes !
Finally we 'll learn what 's going on !
But in the next installment , that person opens the book to discover that the whole thing is written in ancient indecipherable pictograms .
Dammit !
But in the last five minutes , someone notices that the final third of the book is blank , and the ink of the last entry is fresh !
" It 's a work - in - progress , " says Major Character .
" Someone is still writing it !! "
And in the last five minutes of the next episode it is revealed via flashback that Other Major Character studied Ancient Indecipherable Pictology in college -- holy shit !!!!
And this goes on for three more episodes , at which point Major Character confronts Other Major Character with the book , and he ( O.M.C. ) confesses that he is using the book to record the movements of the other castaways , but only because a giant , ambulatory , sentient coconut threatened to kill him if he did n't .
And you , the viewer , are , like , " well , I 'm glad the mystery of the book is cleared up BUT WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A GIANT AMBULATORY SENTIENT COCONUT ??!!! "
Lots and lots of clues ( and episodes about clues ) , but you 're not one jot closer to understanding the central mystery .
And meanwhile the LOST prop department is hastily burying the book in a Superfund site , hoping that no one remembers the title .
I found all this exasperating during season two ( during which I parodied the style with The Adventure of the Missing Stocking . )
But I 've succumbed to Stockholm Syndrome or something , because now I kind of enjoy the sheer absurdity of it .
The structure of the narrative reminds me , in many ways , of a computer roleplaying game ( CRPG ) .
A quick primer for my seven non-nerd readers : in a CRPG ( such as World of Warcraft , a.k.a. WoW ) , you typically start out as a puny little nothing , a 47 - pound weakling armed with a broomstick .
As such , you only have the wherewithal to fight monsters of a comparable degree of fragility ( rats , typically ) .
But every time you dispatch one , you gain " experience , " and once you 've acquired enough experience , you " level " .
Leveling ( as it is called ) means that your abilities go up , you are able to buy and use better weapons , and can now go toe - to - toe with slightly more menacing creatures -- giant ambulatory sentient coconuts , say .
Kill enough of those , level again , and move on to the next class of baddies .
I love CRPGs ( so much so that I 've avoided WoW like the plague -- if I wanted a all - consuming addiction I 'd pick up some heroin from a Seattle street corner , thanks ) .
I love them despite my frequent realizations , while playing , that in - game progress is largely chimeric .
When you 're a level 1 squire it may take you two minutes to kill a rat ; when you are a level 9 knight you can kill a rat with a single stroke -- but you do n't fight rats , you fight ogres , and the time it takes you to kill them is ... two minutes .
You environment levels up as you do , such that you are pretty much playing the same game all the time , albeit with cool new equipment and a more impressive sounding rank .
The excitement you feel upon leveling fades almost immediately , as you start accumulating experience to reach the next stage .
This is the LOST formula in a nutshell .
During each show you gain a little experience in the form of new information : about the island , the characters , or both ; every four episodes or so you level up , as some ( allegedly ) major piece of the overall puzzle falls into place .
After leveling up in a CRPG , you typically head to Ye Olde Flail ' N ' Scented Candle Emporium , sell all your current equipment , and buy the improved weapons that your enhanced abilities now allow you to wield ; likewise , after a revelatory LOST episode , fans chuck all their old theories into the dustbin and cook up new ones consistent with the revised facts .
Then , having done so , each -- the player of a CRPG , or the viewer of LOST -- is handed a brand new quest , or puzzle , or plot plot .
The ephemeral thrill of leveling vanishes , replaced by a longing to hit the next milestone .
You never disembark from the treadmill , it just goes faster .
This may sound like criticism , but it 's not .
It 's admiration .
Like the creators of World of Warcraft , the writers of LOST have managed to throw a saddle on the addictive lure of leveling and ride it to success .
And bully for them .
Like I said , I love this genre , even if I can visualize the levers they are pulling .
LOST is not the first program to attempt this , to be sure .
Lynch tried it with Twin Peaks , but the wheels flew off the cart in the second season ( and even before that , the ride was pretty bumpy ) .
The X - Files came close to pulling it off , but it was n't certain if the writers would ever provide resolution to the core " mythos " mysteries , and after a while fans ( such as myself ) gave up on the series .
That 's what CRPGers call an " endgame problem " -- the game might be fun to play , but the whole enterprise feels pointless unless there 's a clearly - defined " ending " on the horizon .
( Even WoW , which you could conceivably play forever , has a maximum level that a character can reach , giving players a concrete goal toward which to strive . )
The creators of LOST obviated the " endgame problem " by announcing that the series will end in 2010 , and swearing that answers will be supplied .
( For details , see this commendably spoiler - free USA Today article from last year . )
Another piece of lingo that crops up a lot in CRPG circles is " grinding " : when your character has to do the same thing over and over again ( killing rats , for instance ) to acquire the experience necessary to level .
If the CRPG is n't intrinsically interesting , then grinding is just that : a grind .
But if the world is well - constructed , and the game is well - written , grinding is tolerated ( and even enjoyed ) by players as a necessary evil , something to keep you immersed in the storyline as long as possible .
After all , a game in which you started at level 70 and killed the End Boss in your first fight would be lame beyond belief .
Much of LOST is grinding , honestly : stuff to keep the viewer occupied until the next bombshell drops and the story is taken the next level ( so to speak ) .
But here , halfway through season three , it 's becoming increasingly obvious ( at least to me ) that the grinding itself is pretty fun .
That 's high - praise right there : these guys can even stall entertainingly .
Yes some of the episodes are clunkers , and lot of the plot twists do n't endure a moment 's scrutiny , and I STILL REMEMBER THE TITLE OF THE BOOK YOU GODDAMNED CHEATS !!
But the game 's been a lot of fun so far , and I 'll gladly play through to the end .
Journalism faces a crisis around the world and unless it 's fixed , society is in big trouble , American scholar and media activist Robert McChesney says .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
" The market 's not going to solve the problem ....
The technology 's not going to rescue us . "
Great journalism requires resources , institutional support , well - paid journalists and competition , McChesney told an audience at the Simon Fraser University downtown campus Saturday .
Creating institutions that can produce great journalism is going to take " enlightened , engaged , creative policy - making , " he said .
" Short of that , we 'll never be a free society . "
McChesney , the author of several books including Rich Media , Poor Democracy : Communication Politics in Dubious Times , was in Vancouver to attend a conference of the Union for Democratic Communications , a group of academics and media reformers .
Reform movement gains steam
In a speech co-sponsored by Canadians for a Democratic Media , the B.C. Library Association and The Tyee , McChesney talked about how a media reform movement has sprung up in the U.S. in the past five years and how Canadians can learn from the experience .
The organizers of Free Press , a group that McChesney helped found , state the goals of the movement this way : " diverse and independent media ownership , strong public media and universal access to communications . "
Said McChesney : " I think that five years ago , if someone had said to you you 're going to go listen to an American tell you how to organize a media reform movement , you would have said that 's like having Dick Cheney lecture me on human rights .
" That would have represented the ultimate hubris of Americans . "
But in the last few years , as big corporations have sought to increase their control of the media , Americans have been fighting back and winning , McChesney said .
The U.S. -- and probably Canada as well -- is at a " critical juncture " in history where it might be possible to make substantial , long - term changes to the media system , he said .
" There are moments historically in every country in which the range of policy options is much greater than at other times , when society can put you on a path to go one way or another way .
If you pick one way , you 're not getting off it for a long time . "
Conditions for change
Changing the media system has historically required at least two out of three conditions , McChesney said .
The three factors are :
A technological revolution .
When a radical , fundamentally new technology comes along , society has to decide who 's going to run it .
Discredited media content .
Usually this means journalism .
When media content is seen as being " of poor or dubious quality ... people are willing to raise some hell . "
A broader social crisis , where all institutions are being questioned , as happened in the 1960s and '30s .
" My argument is if you get all three of those in line you not only have a critical juncture , you have a chance to do very positive and progressive things , " he said .
" If you only have two of them , you 've still got a chance to do good stuff .
" And we 've got two of them now in the United States and I have a strong feeling you have the same two here . "
The Internet , McChesney said , has brought the technological revolution .
At the same time , " journalism in the United States is in absolute free fall .
Deep , severe , prolonged historical crisis . "
Do n't blame the Net
This crisis , which is being repeated to some extent around the world , is not due to the Internet , despite what media owners claim , McChesney said .
" That 's preposterous .
It 's a deep - seated historical problem that goes back to the beginning of commercial journalism .
" And it 's been aggravated in the last three decades by concentrated ownership , in local markets and nationally , and by severe cutbacks in resources to journalism . "
This crisis , he said , was identified in the early '90s , long before the web was a part of everyday life .
" The Internet might have accentuated it , but it certainly did n't create it . "
Given growing economic inequalities , we may be about to experience the third condition , broader social upheaval , McChesney said .
' Absolute scandal '
Unchecked commercial media pose a major threat , he said .
" We 're in the midst of a tidal wave of hyper - commercialism in this world .
What we 're doing to children in the United States is nothing short of child molesting .
" It 's an absolute scandal .
" And if all the Internet does is to sort of open up ... people 's central nervous systems to Madison Avenue so that every nanosecond and every pixel of our lives is sponsored by some corporation , then I think we 'll rightfully regret the day that the Internet was invented . "
Key issue : Net neutrality
A few more thoughts from McChesney :
On the net neutrality battle in the U.S. , in which telecom companies want to make some Internet sites easier to access than others :
" This is not a fight of the capitalist class versus the masses .
This is a fight of two extraordinarily corrupt , government - created sleazeball monopoly industries -- and that 's being generous -- versus the rest of the human race , including the business community . "
On what big media companies want :
" Company town media where they can own the newspaper , the cable system , three TV stations , eight radio stations in one town .
Have one newsroom serve all .
" It 's their version of heaven , our version of hell .
And it 's a nightmare for anyone except the owners of those company town media . "
On the media reform movement being " progressive " but " nonpartisan " :
" We organize across the political spectrum , left to right ....
This is not a left - right issue .
It 's big money , it 's corporate interests versus everybody else usually . "
On the goal of the U.S. media reform movement :
" Basically , our goal is to make it so no politician can ever run for office in the United States without having to answer on all these issues formally in their campaign .
" We want to do what the environmental movement did in the United States .
In 1964 there was no environmental movement .
No politician ever said anything about the environment in an American campaign .
" In 1976 there was not a single politician who would n't [ talk about the environment ] .
If you were Ronald Reagan , you had to have a policy on the environment . "

LBT has 10 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope
Enlarge Image
Astronomers at the Large Binocular Telescope ( LBT ) in Arizona have released the first images taken using its two giant 8 m diameter mirrors .
The detailed pictures show a spiral galaxy located 102 million light - years away from the Milky Way .
LBT has been 20 years in the making but promises to allow astronomers to probe the Universe further back in time and in more detail than ever before .
" The amount of time and work that was put into this project to reach the point where we are today is immense , " said LBT Director Richard Green .
" To see the telescope operational with both mirrors is a great feeling . "
The $ 120 m ( £ 60 m ) telescope uses two mirrors in tandem to maximise the amount of light it gathers , which allows astronomers to look deep into the Universe .
Using two 8.4 m ( 27ft ) mirrors will give LBT the equivalent light - gathering capacity of a single 11.8 m ( 39 ft ) instrument and the resolution of a 22.8 m ( 75 ft ) telescope .
Impressive detail
The resolution is 10 times greater than the space - based Hubble telescope , which has a 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) mirror .
" The images that this telescope will produce will be like none seen before , " said Professor Peter Strittmatter of the University of Arizona .
The first pictures are false - colour images of the spiral galaxy NGC 2770 .
The pictures show what is a flat disc of stars and glowing gas .
The images - which take advantage of the telescope 's ability to view the same point in space with multiple wavelengths of light - emphasise different features of the galaxy .
Combining ultraviolet and green light shows up clumpy regions of newly formed hot stars in the spiral arms , whilst a combination of red wavelengths highlights older , cooler stars .
The images were taken on 11 and 12 January but have only just now been released .
The LBT is located on Mount Graham in southeastern Arizona .
It achieved " first light " with one mirror on 12 October 2005 when it imaged a spiral galaxy in the constellation of Andromeda .
8 Ways Gaming Has Gone Mainstream Jan. 8 by OMGLists Team
Gaming has moved from your parent 's basement to the limelight .
Here 's the eight reasons why gaming may just supplant all other forms of media in the near future .
8- Legitimacy of Competition
The fact that the term , " cyberathlete " exists is a clear indication that gaming competition is becoming a serious business .
From small Guitar
Hero tournaments at local bars to massive Halo competitions with millions worth in prizes ; gaming competitions are not only gaining momentum as accepted activities , they 're attracting crowds and even syndication .
A tournament company called Major League Gaming has a contract to broadcast gaming competitions on the USA Network .
The market is large enough for a good enough gamer to earn a living and Starcraft is practically Korea 's national sport .
Sooner or later those who pwn will be cutting in line at clubs .
7- Social Networking
Remember those news stories about couples who met on World of Warcraft ?
Did you hear about that guy who was arrested for stalking a girl on Xbox Live ?
How about Republican Ron Paul who held a campaign march in the Alliance city of Ironforge on World of Warcraft 's Wisperwind server ?
Most gamers have friends on Xbox Live or PSN that they 've never met in person .
We all know of the phenomenon of online social networking led by sites like Facebook and MySpace .
Along with these sites , online video games will surely play a large part in the future development of people 's online presence .
Soon many people will be better known by their avatars than their faces .
6- The Tech - friendly Media
More than any other form of media , gaming has adapted masterfully to the new technologies of the 21st century , particularly when it comes to high - definition displays and the penetration of broadband and Wi-Fi .
No form of media has taken to both of the big innovations of the last few years like gaming .
While folks are still hooking analog cable to HDTVs and using America Online with their cable internet , most gamers are using the technologies of today properly , which is why consoles are performing more multimedia functions .
The media companies are learning who its audience is , and it 's usually holding a controller .
5- More than Just Entertainment
Games are no longer considered simply as tools for killing brain cells .
Today there is a rapidly growing market for games as tools for education and fitness .
Companies are looking to develop video games that are educational , while schools are looking to the gaming industry for new kinds of educational tools .
Games like Wii Sports and Wii Fit are melding exercise with gaming .
As games become useful outside the realm of entertainment they not only become more socially accepted , but more important to society .
Educational films , fitness tapes , and even instructional manuals will soon be totally obsolete .
4- Declining Competition
Box - office returns are down .
Cable and network ratings are n't exactly through the roof either .
Most folks would n't touch a book to save their lives , so how are they entertaining themselves ?
More and more , gaming is becoming an acceptable means of entertainment , due in no small part to the staleness of its competitors .
With no end in sight to the Hollywood writer 's strike , the steady influx of videogames could convert many couch potatoes growing tired of three nights a week of " American Gladiators . "
3- Gaming Goes Big
While the increase of independent , low - budget games has been critical in the industry 's success , the big - budget blockbusters are also a key part of keeping the core gaming audience satisfied .
While the conglomeration of big companies and the rapidly - increasing budgets for triple - A titles has led to game creation by committee , there 's no denying that catering to the largest audience possible is an excellent business decision .
It 's the Transformers effect& many will be entertained , even if it is n't forwarding the art form an inch .
2- Increasing Cultural Relevancy
Remember the games of the past ?
They were all about jumping over alligators and eating jelly beans .
Today , more video games are using politics and current events as subject matter .
Call of Duty 4 , for example , portrays the horror of nuclear war inspired by America 's conflict in the Middle East .
Think about Metal Gear Solid 4's plot about private military companies perpetuating war for profit .
Not only are games daring to cover " real - life " topics , they themselves are becoming " real - life " topics .
More and more you 'll see game reviews in newspapers , indy - made video game spoofs , and television shows centering on gaming .
This all indicates that games are normalizing in the world 's collective consciousness .
1- Capturing the Casual Audience
Did anyone honestly believe that this would be the console generation that catered to the elderly and & : gasp : : girls ?
Yet that 's exactly what 's happened , due largely to the success of Nintendo thinking outside the box with the touch - screen Nintendo DS and the motion - sensing Wii .
Before those systems hit it big , it seems as though Sony and Microsoft had resigned to competing over the same sect of hardcore gamers into perpetuity , but Nintendo 's amazing success has broadened the audience considerably , and given its competitors reason to delve into more easy - to - enjoy games .
And that 's why we have dozens of Bejeweled clones on Xbox Live Arcade .

This is the second time I have heard some version of " the enemy could have gotten this information in other places . "
That , my friend is completely irrelevant to the conversation .
" The enemy " has had the information published in Mawsu 'at al - jihad since before 2002 , when a copy was acquired and translated .
I would imagine that there are as many copies of that floating around the terrorist world as there are copies of Southern Living on Georgia coffee tables .
In other words , the cat is not only out of the bag , he 's lived a long , happy , post - bag life and died of old age .
That 's what makes it relevant .
Your argument would seem to be that if we convince ourselves that " the enemy " does n't know what the PCASS is , it must be so whether it is or not .
That 's not what I 'd call a winning strategy .
A good interrogator is mindful that his subject may very well know what the device is and is n't revealing that fact .
Of course , if the device were able tell if a subject were lying with perfect certainty , that issue could be resolved very quickly and the remainder of the interrogation would be a breeze .

Oh no , some would wonder , what to do , what to do ???
" The enemy " was about to be faced with a variation on a device they 'd seen before .
The only way an interrogator can make good use of a lie detector is if the subject believes it actually works , and the only way to do that is to say " this device can tell me if you 're lying . "

Even then , without anything directly addressing this new truth machine , they would had to take the time to research , collect , analyze , and disseminate , which is by the way , expensive , difficult , requires resources , and takes lots and lots of TIME , time we needed to get a couple of steps ahead
The advantage the PCASS has over some other equipment is that it 's compact and can be deployed en masse .
Unfortunately , doing so solves the dissemination problem because the process of making a decision about it happens multiple times in parallel over multiple , smaller areas .

Researchers uncovered the 55.8 million year - old fossil remains of a tiny monkey , the oldest primate ever found in Europe or North America , near the coast of Mississippi .
The discovery sheds light both on the origins of monkeys in North America and on the conditions of the continent during the massive global warming of 55 million years ago .
It suggests that primates came across a land - bridge that once connected Asia and Alaska , where conditions were tropical .
" These primates only inhabited tropical and subtropical forests .
Wet , muggy , warm climates , "
said Chris Beard , lead researcher on the discovery and a paleontologist at Carnegie Mellon Natural History Museum .
" That tells you a lot about the Bering land itself , indirectly .
Think about Costa Rica in Alaska . "
The primate migration occurred during what is known as the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum , a warming of the Earth that Beard described as " one of the only times in history where the rate and magnitude ( of global warming ) is similar to what 's happening today . "
The Earth 's continental structures , however , looked very different from how they do today .
For a brief time , 55.8 million years ago , North America was connected to both Europe and Asia by narrow strips of land .
That led some scientists to theorize that primates migrated to North America from Europe via the land connecting Scotland with Greenland .
Beard said that his finding rules out this migratory flow because primates had already colonized North America when the Europe - North America land - bridge opened .
Beard published his findings on the newly named primate , Teilhardina magnoliana , today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
If you took a look at the one - ounce primate and immediately wanted one as a pet , the closest animal you could find in today 's world is one of Madagascar 's mouse lemurs .

In astronomical terms , it wo n't be long :
In the year 2439 , residents of the Polaris star system , if there are any , will be treated to a transmission of The Beatles 1968 song , " Across the Universe , " courtesy of NASA .
At 7 pm EST on Feb.
4 , NASA , with a little help from its friends at Spain 's space agency , will beam an mp3 of the four - minute song from a giant space antenna near Madrid .
From there , the transmission will begin its long and winding road to Polaris .
Monday marks the 40th anniversary of the recording of the song .
It 's NASA 's birthday too ; the transmission will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the agency 's founding , as well as the 50th anniversary of Explorer 1 , the first US satellite , and the founding 45 years ago of the Deep Space Network , a network of antennas around the world that transmits and receives signals from distant stars .
The song got its ticket to ride on NASA 's signal when Martin Lewis , a Los Angeles - based Beatles historian , secured permission from former Beatle Paul McCartney , John Lennon 's widow Yoko Ono , and the two companies that own the rights to The Beatles ' music , to have NASA transmit the song into deep space .
According to The Associated Press , one of those companies , Apple Records , said that it was happy to approve sending the song because it is " always looking for new markets . "
But there 's a good chance that NASA 's transmission will be for no one .
To pick up the signal , our Polaris denizen would need to have an antenna and a receiver .
The alien listeners ( assuming they have ears ) would also need technology to decrypt the mp3 format .
Still , those involved are nothing if not optimistic .
Mr. Lewis , placing his trust in the taxman , told The Guardian , " We do n't know if there 's life out there , but I 'd like to think the US government would n't be spending taxpayers ' money on this if there was no hope . "
Mr. McCartney , for his part , dashed off a short note to NASA endorsing the project .
" Amazing !
Well done , NASA ! " read his message .
" Send my love to the aliens .
All the best , Paul . "
Whether or not the song will reach anyone , we can expect no reply , at least not for a long , long , long , time .
Polaris , also known as the North Star , is located at the end of the handle of the little dipper , about 2.5 quadrillion miles away .
Traveling at lightspeed , the signal will take 431 years to reach the star , and it 'll be at least that long again before we get any response .
Sending the song any faster would require exceeding the speed of light .
And you can't do that .

An Introduction to
The Gauge Integral
also known as
the generalized Riemann integral , the Henstock integral ,
the Kurzweil integral , the Henstock - Kurzweil integral ,
the HK - integral , the Denjoy - Perron integral , etc .

Historical and Bibliographical Overview
Still later , Riemann refined the definition that Cauchy had been using , and investigated the integrals of discontinuous functions .
The Riemann integral is simpler to define than any of the other integrals discussed below , and it is the " standard " integral that we teach to undergraduate students .
Still , it is more complicated than the antiderivative , and it seems to be beyond the understanding of many undergraduate students .
The theory of the Riemann integral was not fully satisfactory .
Many important functions do not have a Riemann integral -- even after we extend the class of integrable functions slightly by allowing " improper " Riemann integrals .
Moreover , even for integrable functions , it is difficult to prove good convergence theorems using only the tools ordinarily associated with Riemann integrals .
A pointwise , bounded limit of Riemann integrable functions is not necessarily Riemann integrable .
( For instance , since the rationals are enumerable , the characteristic function of the rationals can be represented as the pointwise limit of a sequence of characteristic functions of finite sets . )
In 1902 , Henri Lebesgue devised a new approach to integration , overcoming many of the defects of the Riemann integral .
Lebesgue 's definition is appreciably more complicated , but Lebesgue 's techniques yield better convergence theorems and , for the most part , more integrable functions .
The Lebesgue integral has become the " standard " integral in our graduate courses in analysis .
The Lebesgue integral is strictly more general than the proper Riemann integral -- i.e. , it can integrate a wider class of functions .
However , in comparing the improper Riemann integral with the Lebesgue integral , we find that neither is strictly more general than the other .
Examples will be given later in this article .
Neither the improper Riemann integral nor the Lebesgue integral yielded a fully satisfactory construction of antiderivatives .
Slightly more satisfactory answers -- i.e. , more general notions of integral -- were given by Arnaud Denjoy ( 1912 ) and Oskar Perron ( 1914 ) .
Denjoy 's and Perron 's definitions turned out to be equivalent ; both were very complicated .
Decades later , independently , Ralph Henstock ( 1955 ) and Jaroslav Kurzweil ( 1957 ) found a much simpler formulation of the Denjoy - Perron integral .
In fact , the Henstock - Kurzweil formulation -- the gauge integral -- is considerably simpler than the Lebesgue idea , and its definition is only slightly different from the definition of the Riemann integral .
Consequently , interest in this integral has been rising over the last few decades , and some mathematicians have even advocated that we should teach the gauge integral either alongside or in place of either the Riemann integral or the Lebesgue integral .
I will express my own opinions about that possibility , at the bottom of this web page .
( In January 1997 I circulated a letter advocating the use of the gauge integral .
It was signed by Henstock , Kurzweil , and several other leaders of the gauge integral movement .
I distributed it to several publishers of calculus textbooks .
However , it apparently has n't had any effect . )
Henstock , Kurzweil , and other early researchers in this area were writing in rather specialized and technical terms for advanced audiences , so their ideas did not spread quickly at first .

The Definition
Now a very slight modification yields the definition of the gauge integral .
Again , there are several different , equivalent ways to define the gauge integral ; we shall give only the formulation which emphasizes the similarity between the Riemann and gauge integrals .
The collection of numbers n , s i , t i is called a tagged division ( or a tagged partition ) ; the numbers s i are called the tags .
The tagged division is called δ- fine if it satisfies the condition t i -t i - 1 < δ (s i ) for all i .
Some of the books and papers on this subject use a slightly different condition , e.g. , that s i - δ(s i ) < t i - 1 < t i < s i +δ( s i ) .
This affects the development of the theory only superficially -- e.g. , in some places we need to replace an ε with either 2 ε or ε/2 .
Cousin's Lemma states that for any gauge δ , there exists at least one δ- fine tagged division .
Cousin's Lemma is not obvious ; that is admittedly a drawback in the gauge theory .
The proof of Cousin's Lemma uses the fact that the real number system has the Least Upper Bound property .
There are several slightly different ways to prove Cousin 's Lemma ; here is a sketch of one of the proofs .
Let S={x ∈ [ a , b ] : there exists a δ - fine tagged division on [ a , x ]} .
Then S is nonempty , since a∈S .
Also , S is bounded above by b.
By the Least Upper Bound Property , the set S has a supremum , or least upper bound ; let us denote that number by σ .
Then σ ∈ [ a , b ] .
If σ < b , use the fact that δ( σ ) > 0 to arrive at a contradiction .
If σ = b , use the fact that δ( b ) > 0 to prove that the supremum is actually a maximum -- i.e. , that b is a member of S .
The set of all gauge - integrable functions from [ a , b ] to R is a vector space -- i.e. , any constant multiple of such a function or any sum of two such functions is another such function .
That vector space is often known as the Denjoy space , because of some work Denjoy did in studying it .
We have only considered the simplest possible versions of the definitions , but we remark that some generalizations are possible .
With slightly more complicated definitions , we could allow plus and minus infinity as possible values for the integrals .
( Just equip the extended real line with its usual convergence structure , and use convergences instead of epsilons .
This variant is used in the appendix to Anatole Beck 's book , Continuous Flows in the Plane . )
. )
Or , instead of working with real - valued functions f , we could work with functions f taking values in any Banach space X ; most of the main properties generalize easily to this setting .
( See my book , for instance . )
We could also replace [ a , b ] with other domains , but that is harder ; it is discussed below .
Henstock and Kurzweil have also considered replacing the expression f(s i ) ( t i t i1 ) with a more general expression g(s i , [t i1 , t i ] ) , where g is a function of a real variable and an interval variable ; but the results in that case are more complicated and will not be considered here .
Simplicity and Concreteness of the Definitions
However , the fact that we 're using properties of intervals means that the gauge integral does not generalize readily to settings other than intervals .
It can be generalized to functions defined on the whole real line , or to functions defined on finite - dimensional spaces , but its definition and theory then become slightly more complicated .
It apparently can also be generalized to infinite dimensional spaces , and more abstract setttings , but I 'm not very familiar with this theory , and I believe it 's a lot more complicated .
Some of Henstock 's writing deals with this theory .
I believe that Muldowney 's book gives a more elementary treatment of this theory , but I have to confess that I 'm not very familiar with the theory or with his book .
Contrast that with the Lebesgue approach , which requires far more prerequisite equipment ( sigma - algebras , measures , measurable sets , measurable functions ) but then generalizes without any difficulty at all to settings entirely unrelated to intervals .
Thus , the Lebesgue approach may be preferable if one wants to study stochastic processes such as Brownian motion .
( Brownian motion can be explained in terms of Wiener measure , a measure on an infinite - dimensional space of continuous functions . )
Here is an example of the concreteness of the gauge integral :
Any introductory course on measure and integration should include a construction of Lebesgue measure , but how should that be done ?
The usual constructions are rather complicated and abstract ; they have little to do with the uses of Lebesgue measure .
But it is easy to define the gauge integral , and after we 've defined it we can proceed this way : Define
S
A Simple Example
Generality : Existence of Integrals
As indicated by the Venn diagram above , not every Lebesgue integral can be viewed as a Riemann integral , or even as an improper Riemann integral .
For a simple example , consider the characteristic function of the rationals .
As indicated by the Venn diagram above , not every improper Riemann integral is a Lebesgue integral .
For an example , let f( t ) = t2 cos ( 1/t2 ) with f( 0 ) =0 .
Then 0 1|f '( t ) |dt is infinite , and the Lebesgue integral 0 1f '( t ) dt does not exist , but the improper Riemann integral 0 Tf ' ( t ) dt exists ( for any T ) and equals f( T ) .
The examples above are typical .
If g(t ) is any gauge integrable function on [ a , b ] , then g(t ) is Lebesgue measurable .
Hence the Lebesgue integral a b|g(t ) |dt exists , if we permit infinity as a possible value .
The Lebesgue integral a bg(t ) dt exists ( with its usual definition ) if and only if a b|g(t ) |dt is finite .
For any nonnegative function , the Lebesgue and gauge integrals are the same .
This analogy may be helpful :
The gauge integrable functions are like convergent series ; then the Lebesgue integrable functions are like absolutely convergent series .
The absolutely convergent series are easier to work with , and yield a tidier theory .
The convergent series are more general , but only occasionally do we need to work with a series that is conditionally convergent .
Rapidly oscillating functions such as the derivative of t2 cos( 1/t2 ) are the only ones added to our collection of integrable functions when we switch from the Lebesgue integral to the gauge integral .
These functions are more often used for pathological counterexamples than for positive applications .
Thus the greater generality of the gauge theory does not make it much more applicable .
( A possible exception is in the theory of differential equations ; there seem to be some important new applications there . )
For the most part , the big advantage of the gauge integral is the new insight that it yields into the Lebesgue integral .
Here is another drawback to the gauge theory :
The Lebesgue theory yields the Banach space L1 [ a , b ] of all Lebesgue - integrable functions .
It 's a very nice space , with a nice metric and nice convergence theorems .
The gauge theory yields a slightly larger vector space , which we might call G[a , b ] .
But the metric and the convergence theorems for this space are much less nice .
That 's not surprising : this space contains not only the nice functions of L1 [ a , b ] , but also some additional functions that are rather nasty .
If we do n't really need to work with those nasty functions , we might prefer to stick to the setting of L1 [ a , b ] , which has nicer worktools ( i.e. , the metric , the convergence theorems , etc. ) .
Fundamental Theorems
First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus ( derivatives of integrals ) .
Let f be a real - valued , gauge integrable function on [ a , b ] , and let F ( t ) = a tf ( s ) ds .
Then : ( a ) the derivative F '( t ) exists and equals f( t ) , for almost every t in [ a , b ] . ( b ) the derivative F '( t ) exists and equals f( t ) , at each t where f is continuous .
Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus ( integrals of derivatives ) .
Let F be a real - valued , differentiable function on [ a , b ] .
Then the gauge integral a b F ' ( t ) dt exists and equals F ( b )  F( a ) .
a
Actually , the hypotheses can be made even weaker :
We can allow F to be nondifferentiable at countably many points .
More precisely : Assume F is continuous , and that G is some function defined at every point of [ a , b ] , and that F ' ( t ) exists and equals G( t ) for all but at most countably many values of t .
Then the gauge integral a b G( t ) dt exists and equals F ( b )  F( a ) .
Improper Integrals
( Clarification :
The function f must be defined at every point of [ a , b ] .
In the case of f( t ) =1/√t on the interval ( 0,1 ] , we also assign some value to f( 0 ) .
What value we assign does n't really matter , just so long as f( 0 ) is some particular number . )
Convergence Theorems
Suppose ( f n ) is a sequence of Riemann integrable functions on [ a , b ] , converging uniformly to a limit f .
Then f and |f n f| are Riemann integrable , and as well .
Dominated Convergence Theorem .
Suppose ( f n ) is a sequence of gauge integrable functions , converging pointwise to a limit f .
Also suppose that e(t ) < f n ( t ) < g(t ) for all n and t , where e and g are some gauge - integrable functions .
Then f and |f n f| are gauge integrable , and as well .
There are other convergence theorems for gauge integrals , involving hypotheses weaker than the domination condition e(t ) < f n ( t ) < g(t ) , but those theorems are generally much more complicated .
Research is still being done in that area .
The role of the gauge integral in teaching analysis
Here are my opinions ( substantially revised 11/16/00 ) .
The role of the gauge integral in our teaching must be viewed in terms of the way that we presently teach analysis .
Here in the USA , we usually teach analysis on three levels :
The freshman calculus course , which uses the Riemann integral and omits most proofs .
An advanced undergraduate course , typically using a textbook titled " Introduction to Real Analysis " or something like that .
This course generally teaches how to do analysis proofs ; it includes proofs of the results that were stated without proof in calculus .
A beginning graduate course , which generally covers the Lebesgue integral .
a
Level ( 2 ) , on the other hand , would be an excellent place to introduce the gauge integral .
The conventional course at the advanced undergraduate level concentrates on the use of tools such as epsilons and deltas , convergent sequences , limsups and liminfs , etc .
Those are the same tools used in the theory of the gauge integral .
Thus , adding that integral to the course would only involve slight modifications in the course .
The book by DePree and Swartz is particularly well suited for this purpose .
Bartle and Sherbert , 3rd edition , is also applicable to this purpose , though it devotes slightly fewer pages to the gauge integral .
Introducing the gauge integral into level ( 3 ) , the graduate course , might also be a good idea , but it would involve greater complication .
The graduate course has its share of epsilons and limsups , but its most basic tools are topologies and sigma - algebras , a very different sort of thinking .
The gauge integral does not generalize readily to abstract settings like abstract sigma - algebras .
( It can be generalized to a setting something like that , but it then loses much of its wonderful simplicity . )
In its simplest form , it is more like the Lebesgue integral with respect to Lebesgue measure , not other measures .
Of course , Lebesgue measure is the most important measure .
( Perhaps we should deemphasize the other measures in the first graduate course on integration theory , in order to make the gauge integral fit into the course more readily .
Other measures can be developed in greater detail in a later course . )
I think that the two theories -- Lebesgue and gauge -- both are valuable , and both deserve to be covered in the graduate course .
I 'm not yet sure what is the best way to organize such a course .
We can develop one of the two theories , and then use its results as tools in developing the other theory .
This is the approach taken by Gordon 's book ( which develops the Lebesgue theory first ) and by Bartle 's " MTI " book and the Lee / Vyborny book ( both of which develop the gauge theory first ) .
Some remarks on the lack of pathological examples
Of course , there are some obvious examples -- e.g. , if we permit the function to be unbounded or if we permit its domain to be unbounded .
But what about a bounded function on a bounded interval ?
Within this class of functions , it is hard to give an example of a function that is not integrable .
It was already hard enough with the Riemann integral -- for that integral we had to use rather bizarre functions , such as the characteristic function of the rationals .
Now , when we turn to the gauge integral or the Lebesgue integral , more functions are integrable , and so it is even harder to produce examples of non-integrable functions .
Actually , the problem is the same for gauge integrals or Lebesgue integrals .
Indeed , when f is a bounded real - valued function on a bounded interval , then these three conditions are equivalent :
f is gauge integrable ;
f is Lebesgue integrable ;
f is Lebesgue measurable .
" every bounded function on a bounded interval is gauge integrable . "
Every introductory textbook on Lebesgue integrals includes a short proof ( due to Vitali ) of the existence of a nonmeasurable set ; the characteristic function of that set is then a nonmeasurable function .
But that proof , like every known proof of that theorem , is nonconstructive -- it uses the Axiom of Choice to prove the existence of the nonmeasurable function without actually " finding " the function or describing it explicitly .
Vitali's proof is one of the most elementary uses of the Axiom of Choice , and perhaps it makes a good introduction to the Axiom of Choice ; it could be included in an appendix in a book intended for some advanced undergraduate students .
But I think this is conceptually way beyond the grasp of freshman calculus students .
All we can do is tell these students : " Yes , there does exist a non-integrable , bounded function on a bounded interval , but describing it to you would require a great deal of higher math , far beyond the scope of this freshman calculus course . "
You might notice that , in the last paragraph , I said that every known proof requires the Axiom of Choice .
Is it possible that we may someday find another proof that is constructive ?
i.e. , that we may find an explicit example of an unmeasurable function ?
Probably not .
This is not just a personal opinion -- it has some supporting evidence , though the evidence is rather technical .
Solovay proved in 1970 that the nonexistence of a nonmeasurable function is consistent with ZF set theory ( i.e. , conventional set theory minus the Axiom of Choice ) , provided that there exists an inaccessible cardinal .
The existence of an inaccessible cardinal is empirically consistent with conventional set theory -- i.e. , after many decades , no one has yet found a contradiction , so Solovay 's model seems to be reliable .
If you 're interested , these topics are discussed a little more in my book , and more references are given there .
--
My , we certainly seem to have gotten into some deep math , while discussing what to teach to freshmen !
Some Open Research Problems
Veterans Affairs refuses to provide voter registration for wounded vets John Byrne

VA suggests voter registration not held because it 's partisan
At a quiet 1999 ceremony in MaComb County , Michigan , a plainspoken former Texas governor delivered a patriotic speech to commemorate Veterans ' Day .
But none of the eight veterans interviewed by The New York Times after the ceremony promised George W. Bush their vote .
A new report Thursday reveals that Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake told two Democratic senators his department will not help injured veterans register to vote before the 2008 election .
" VA remains opposed to becoming a voter registration agency pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act , as this designation would divert substantial resources from our primary mission , " Peake said in an April 8th letter to Sens.
Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) and John Kerry ( D - MA ) acquired by Steven Rosenfeld at Alternet .
Peake refers to a 1993 law that allows government departments to engage in voter registration efforts , Rosenfeld says .
What this means is that many injured veterans still in VA hospitals who can't find means to register outside of their facilities will effectively lose their right to vote .
Wounded veterans who have moved must re-register at their " new addresses " or file for absentee ballots in order to participate in the presidential and other elections .
Peake defends the decision by saying that a court recently ruled the VA 's limits on " partisan political activities " " does not on its face violate [ veterans ' ]
First Amendment ' rights , " Rosenfeld notes , without articulating how registering veterans is a partisan activity .
Peake added , " VA shares your commitment to assisting veterans in exercising their Constitutional right to vote . "
The court ruling he 's appears to be referring to is Patrick Griffin v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs , in which a Federal Circuit of Appeals court upheld the VA 's rules governing the conduct of those who practice " free speech " -- or protest -- in government graveyards .
Among other things , the VA prohibits " partisan activities , i.e. , those involving commentary or actions in support of , or in opposition to , or attempting to influence , any current policy of the Government of the United States , or any private group , association , or enterprise . "
Sens. Kerry and Feinstein fired off a letter in reply .
" The Department of Veterans Affairs should provide voter materials to veterans , " Feinstein wrote , according to Rosenfeld 's report .
" I believe the cost of providing these voter materials is minimal .
It 's a small price to pay for the sacrifice these men and women have made in fighting for our nation 's freedom .
I am disappointed . "
" You 'd think that when so many people give speeches about keeping faith with our veterans , the least the government would do is protect their right to vote , after they volunteered to go thousands of miles from home to fight and give that right to others , " Kerry said .
" And yet we 've seen the government itself block veterans from registering to vote in VA facilities , without any legal basis or rational explanation . "
Veterans ' Affairs other scandals
It is n't the first time the Bush Administration 's Department of Veterans '
Affairs has been accused of slighting the nations thousands of Iraq vets .
In 2005 , Salon.com 's Mark Benajamin revealed that military naval hospitals were delivering grossly subpar treatment to vets .
Before he hanged himself with his bathrobe sash in the psychiatric ward at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , Spc. Alexis Soto - Ramirez complained to friends about his medical treatment .
Soto - Ramirez , 43 , had been flown out of Iraq five months before then because of chronic back pain that became excruciating during the war .
But doctors were really worried about his mind .
They thought he suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder after serving with the 544th Military Police Company , a unit of the Puerto Rico National Guard , the kind of unit that saw dirty , face - to - face combat in Iraq .
A copy of Soto - Ramirez 's medical records , reviewed by Salon , show that a doctor who treated him in Puerto Rico upon his return from Iraq believed his mental problems were probably caused by the war and that his future was in the Army 's hands .
" Clearly , the psychiatric symptoms are combat related , " a clinical psychologist at Roosevelt Roads Naval Hospital wrote on Nov. 24 , 2003 .
The entry says , " Outcome will depend on adequacy and appropriateness of treatment . "
Doctors in Puerto Rico sent Soto - Ramirez to Walter Reed in Washington , D.C. , to get the best care the Army had to offer .
There , he was put in Ward 54 , Walter Reed 's " lockdown , " or inpatient psychiatric ward , where the most troubled patients are supposed to have constant supervision .
At that time , Walter Reed officials would n't discuss Salon 's findings : " We are satisfied that there is a very high level of patient satisfaction with their treatment . "
The Washington Post 's Dana Priest delivered a stunning series on the failures at the hospital in her series , " The Other Walter Reed , " for which she and her newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize .
" Behind the door of Army Spec. Jeremy Duncan 's room , part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air , weighted down with black mold , " Priest wrote .
" When the wounded combat engineer stands in his shower and looks up , he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole .
The entire building , constructed between the world wars , often smells like greasy carry - out .
Signs of neglect are everywhere : mouse droppings , belly - up cockroaches , stained carpets , cheap mattresses . "
Veterans ' advocates are incensed about the VA 's decision not to allow registration at military hospitals .
" During a time of war , our Nation has a special and sacred duty to assist our fellow citizens who have defended our Constitution with their lives - our military veterans -- with registering to vote and with voting , " Paul Sullivan , Veterans for Common Sense executive director , told Rosenfeld .
" We encourage VA to allow non-partisan voter registration drives at VA facilities so that as many veterans as possible can actively participate in our democracy -- we owe our veterans no less for standing between a bullet and our Constitution . "
You ’d never know they were running for the same party .
Hillary Clinton is using the Wright controversy to try and get superdelegates on her side .
No wonder the Tonya Harding comparison keeps being brought up .
It ’s bad for Obama and it ’s no good for her .
Why ?
Obama has closed the super delegate gap and is now even with Clinton when it comes to endorsements .
Moreover :
Obama , an Illinois senator , has the support of 99 Democratic U.S. lawmakers and governors , compared with Clinton ’s 96 — a dramatic turnabout since the Jan.
3 Iowa caucuses , when Clinton , a New York senator , had more than double Obama ’s support within this group , 91 to 43 .
But still , Hillary Clinton wo n’t let go of her dream , maybe just because she does n’t know how .
It is not in her personality make - up to give up , even if she is just not good enough :
Perhaps what propels Mrs Clinton more than anything is a determination to prove she can be as good at politics as her husband , who she once said “ makes it look so easy ” .
But months on the hustings have shown she lacks his legendary political talents .
This personal trait still makes up the biggest problem for the Democratic Party .
If there is no decision from outside , she will take them down with her .
This has ceased to be a question solely of listening to what the voters have to say .
It is and remains a question of what Hillary Clinton feels she is entitled to have .
And as with a spoiled child clamouring for chewing gum at the supermarket check out line , an adult has to step in and tell her she can’t have it .
Or , else :
By late summer , a rested John McCain will try to reassure Americans that he will run their country just like he ran his campaign .
A wounded Barack Obama will have won a Pyrrhic nomination .
And an angry Hillary Clinton will be gone – but the latest addition to the Clinton legacy not forgotten .
MSNBC host slams Bill O'Reilly for blaming dead mothers
MSNBC's Dan Abrams reported Wednesday on Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly 's comments on the murder - suicide of pro wrestler Chris Benoit .
O'Reilly had blamed Benoit 's wife , as well as another recently - murdered woman , for their own deaths , saying , " In both of these terrible situations , the men involved were troubled and chaotic , and the women involved had to know that .
...
Those ladies made big mistakes .
They were obligated to protect their children ...
They did not protect them . "
" This is an absolute outrage , " said Abrams , calling O'Reilly 's statements " an insult to their families and all victims of violent crime . "
MSNBC 's legal analyst Susan Filan added , " This is sick !
Men are flocking to the defense of men who kill women .
...
It is a culture of enabling . "
Abrams then spoke to radio talk show host John DePetro , who lost his own job in 2006 for gay - bashing remarks on - air and is now defending O'Reilly .
" John , do n't you think you should distance yourself from him on this one ? " asked Abrams .
DePetro replied , " Bill O'Reilly , that 's why he 's striking a chord with people .
Her number one priority should have been to protect that baby and protect the two year old .
And she 's lucky that the ... well , she 's dead , but the two year old is alive . "

One of the fundamental rules , which you wont read about in any security book and you can learn only through experience is that everything is in symbiosis .
This means that the security models of the individual components in a system are co-dependent .
For example , the security of a server is dependent on the security of the individual clients connected to it and the the security of the clients depend on the security of the servers they are interacting with .
If you know how to take advantage of this rule you can hack / break into anything .
Let 's see how this rule applies to WiFi networks and especially those found in London as I find the situation rather concerning .
When we talk about WiFi security we usually stumble across things such as encryption , WPA and WPA2 , 802.11 authentication , client - side certificates , network segmentation , vlanning , captive portals , etc , etc , etc .
Yet , none of these technologies provide security but rather things such as privacy and identity verification and authorization .
These are the basic components of a secure WiFi network but by no means a one - stop solution to all problems .
Even when properly deployed / configured , problems in WiFi networks occur in much deeper or higher level and it requires a bit more creativity , intelligence and strategy to identify them .
So here , I would like to briefly outline a couple of scenarios , some of which you might be familiar with , that led to full compromise of the organizations we were asked to legally break into .
All these scenarios are possible due to the " symbiosis paradigm " , which I discussed at the begging of this post .
Physical Breakins And WiFi Security
This is one of the oldest tricks available to the mankind .
It is like the Trojan Horse in ancient Greece .
The strategy is very simple .
If one finds a way to get a physical access to the building he / she can deploy an wireless access point which later will be used to break into that organization .
Now , how hard is to obtain that access ?
Easier then you think !
Keep in mind that companies do business .
Their buildings are not impenetrable fortresses .
If you show your stuff they are willing to show theirs .
Many times a physical breakin is almost as simple as walking into the lobby and finding an unprotected network adapter to put your access point there .
Sometimes it requires things such as walking through the backdoor into the common / dinning area .
Even knowing an insider 's smoking pattern proves to be very , very helpful .
Once inside , hardly anyone asks you what you are doing there .
Not to mention that people are not used to question your authority if you politely explain to them that you are performing a security penetration test which aims to break into their networks .
The truth is that humans can detect suspicious activities by following your body language .
The more you lie the the more negative messages you are sending to the people around you and of course the higher is the chance to get caught .
So , being honest is actually a plus rather then a minus .
Even having access to a conference area is quite easy as you can arrange supposedly important meeting with someone from inside .
Usually you find the network jacks underneath the table where you can connect whatever needs to be connected .
Now , if you 've been in the wireless security business long enough you will probably argue that you can detect rogue access points and that you can turn on or off ports of the switch in order to guarantee some kind of security .
However , only a few will admit that this system hardly works as they are often hundreds of neighboring wireless networks around the premises and often ports are left on due to the fact that it is extremely hard to keep track of what people do .
Your best friend is probably your network architecture .
The more segmented network you have the lower the chances for the attacker to obtain further access .
Security in depth does work but keep in mind that you have to take into consideration the " symbiosis paradigm " and this is hard and it works against the security in depth practices .
Stepping Stone Attacks / Hacks
Hacking / breaking into a network is often easily done through already trusted clients .
Evil Tween attacks work 100 % .
Ok , ok , nothing new here but it is time for people to take a sip from the kool - aid called reality .
Breaking into a client first and then breaking into the target network is what we call stepping stone attacks .
Even if the WiFi network employs the most strict security policies clients are meant to work .
John Johnson from 3rd flour needs to access information from that database or save / read files from that and that location .
Breaking into John 's laptop is easier .
Stupid tricks work the best .
When someone needs to get the job done they often forget about security and take all sorts of risks .
" Oh , wifi network is not working , right , let 's check my list .
Here it is .
This is my network !
Connect "
However , the victim fails to comprehend that that that network is not his / her network as it is " open " .
The only similarity between the two networks is that they have the same name .
However , most users are not technically savvy to understand that and this of course works against the organizations who employ them .
Again , everyone who has been in the WiFi security business for long enough will argue that everybody should have a good client - side security policies .
That the firewall needs to be always on and that each system needs to be patched with the latest fixes .
Rules should be applied to guarantee that when wired ports are on , wifi is off and vice versa .
End - point security must be enforced and users should run from unprivileged accounts .
However , only those that have hands - on experience will say that this is hardly enough .
The client 's firewall is a minor issue .
If the attacker controls the network they control the underlaying clients - a classic example of the " symbiosis " thing we 've talked about .
Your best strategy is be prepared for eventual breakins .
This is where we get out of the geek / tech side of the problem and we dive into much more important things such as what will be the impact if data is stolen .
You need crisis management plans , combined with BPR ( Black Public Relations ) counter plans .
A fellow and much wiser college of mine once said that only fools thing that they can solve security problems by employing security solutions .
Think about Visa Net .
They have a rough estimate how much money will be stolen per month but this number has been already covered so that the loss is so small that it is almost insignificant .
Guest WiFi Networks
And The " thinking in 3rd person " Strategy
We promote tiger teams operations rather then standard tests most , if not all , companies in the security market provide .
Having a test with not clear objectives is almost like spending your money for nothing .
Do n't think tech .
Think impact !
Think about objectives .
What your business depends on ?
Do not ask anyone to identify vulnerabilities .
Ask them to do something specific like : " I want you to find ways to steal money . " , or " I want you to find ways get to that type of data . " .
This is much more valuable then a report full of useless bugs you know that you cannot fix in the next year .
Where is the value ?
This is something to think about as I will show you that your wireless security is dependent on the security of every single sub -system you are interacting with .
Here is how it goes .
Your WiFi network is probably secure but what 's the security of your business partners '
WiFi networks ?
Typically , and by saying " typically " I really mean all the time , companies have unprotected WiFi networks that are specifically designed for guests only .
These networks are entirely open and have something like BlueSocket or something else that acts as a captive portal .
The guest enters their password of the day and they are in .
Unfortunately their entire traffic travels clean an clear in the air as well as their POP3 credentials and their HTTP sessions .
When we were once asked to break into some organizations , which names we cannot disclose , we went exactly the opposite way of the expected .
We researched the company and found all other companies they work with .
Then we went onsite and discovered that some of these companies run open wifi networks for guests .
It did not take us long to obtain access to sensitive mail , through leaked POP3 credentials which also got us a VPN access and other goodies .
The next time someone starts bragging about how 1337 memory corruption bugs exploits are and how with their invisible linux rootkit they can hide their activities , shut them up but showing them this article .
Hacking is a survival trick and the act to outsmart others .
There are no rules .
Use your head not your ego and be creative as much as you can .
I would suggest to develop creativity rather then technical knowledge as the second can be obtained very rapidly .
The first one requires a life style not many can keep up with .
By no means these are all tricks / realizations of the trade but we keep the best ones for ourselves .
Renaming ECMAScript 4 for the final standard ?
The proposed ECMAScript 4 standard contains very different paradigms to the current JavaScript / ECMAScript standard .
In my view , it is the equivalent of the changes between C and C++ - it 's designed largely to be a revolution rather than a mere evolution of the current ECMAScript / JavaScript standard .
Therefore I would like to propose that ECMAScript 4 ( aka JavaScript 2 ) has a different name to minimise confusion and punctuate the difference between two languages with fundamentally different design decisions and paradigms .
Whatsmore , any name would be free of any trademark issues , unlike the name JavaScript , and could become a widely used name for the standard , unlike ECMAScript .
Has this previously been discussed or is the current name set in stone ?

Bush uses briefing as ' megaphone ' to push Congress on telecom immunity Ron Brynaert
Published : Thursday February 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Update : ACLU spokesperson protests that FISA fight is about lawbreaking , not about money President Bush held a news conference Thursday morning to press Congress to pass an intelligence bill making it easier for the government to conduct domestic eavesdropping on phone calls and e-mails in connection with terrorism investigations .
MSNBC's David Gregory noted that Bush was availing himself of the " megaphone " at his disposal , as president , by being able to garner television time to fight for the legislation he wants passed .
Bush met with reporters in the White House press briefing room at 10:05 a.m. EST Thursday .
A temporary intelligence law has expired , and Bush wants Congress to renew it , and to provide legal immunity to telecommunications companies that helped the government after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Beforehand , White House press secretary Dana Perino said Bush also would push Congress on three other areas : to fully fund the Iraq war , to adopt housing legislation , and to approve a major increase in money to fight HIV / AIDS in Africa .
Gregory also speculated that Bush would address recent " bad economic " news reports .
" Without the cooperation of the private sector we cannot protect our country from terrorist attacks , " Bush said early in the briefing , as he urged Congress to give immunity to telecoms .
Referring to class - action plaintiff 's attorneys , Bush said , " I do n't want to try to get inside their head .
I suspect they see , you know , a financial gravy train , [ by ] trying to sue these companies . "
In response , ACLU Washington spokeswoman Liz Rose told RAW STORY that the argument was about potential lawbreaking , and criticized the president -- and his " acolytes " in the Republican party -- for clouding the issue by making profiteering accusations .
" The Bush White House and their acolytes now claim that we must give giant telecoms amnesty for breaking the law , or else those telecoms will no longer cooperate with the government in spying efforts that help protect America , " Rose told RAW STORY .
" But the truth is that telecoms do not need a special deal .
In fact , these companies have immunity from lawsuits for turning over customer records to the government if they do so in conformity with existing law . "
Rose added , " But , in this instance , the telephone companies knowingly violated that law .
If we give them a free pass this time , wo n't the telephone companies feel free to violate the laws protecting our privacy in the future ? "
" The Bush Administration and their supporters in Congress complain that these lawsuits are simply about money and enriching trial lawyers - suggesting that the litigation should be stopped because of the potential damages that might be awarded in such lawsuits , " the civil liberties group spokesperson continued .
" This criticism ignores the fact that , according to the rules in the federal court , the only way that we could ensure that a federal judge could continue to explore previous violations if the companies simply changed their participation or the government changed or ended the program was to ask for minimal damages . "
Rose added , " We are not interested in recovering money for ourselves .
We , however , are committed to assuring that these giant companies are held accountable for violating the law now and thus dissuaded from violating the law in the future . "
As Bush began speaking , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , cast the president 's position as a " tiresome campaign ... to avoid accountability for the unlawful surveillance of Americans . "
" The president once again is misusing his bully pulpit , " Leahy said .
" Once again they are showing they are not above fear - mongering if that 's what it takes to get their way . "
Addressing the economy , Bush told a reporter that he did n't " think we were headed to a recession , but no question we 're in a slowdown . "
" Echoing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Bush says a Senate proposal to deal with the foreclosure crisis would ' do more to bail out lenders and speculators than to help American families keep their homes , ' " USA Today noted .
Bush blasted Democrats for not supporting his " surge , " and accused them of advocating " retreat . "
" Unfortunately this week the Senate debated yet another bill that threatens to cut off funding and tie the hands of our commanders in Iraq , " Bush said .
" It seems that no matter what happens in Iraq , opponents of the war have one answer : retreat .
I guess you could say that when it comes to pushing for withdrawal their strategy is to stay the course . "
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama hit back at the president in a statement released Thursday afternoon by his campaign .
 With their words today , George Bush and John McCain called for staying the course with an endless war in Iraq and a failed policy of not talking to leaders we dont like , but Americans of all political persuasions are calling for change , " Obama said .
" The American people arent looking for tough talk about fighting for 100 years in Iraq , because they know we need to end this war , finish the job in Afghanistan , and take the fight to al Qaeda . "
On another issue , Bush said that Turkey 's offensive against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq should be limited  and should end as soon as possible .
The ongoing fighting has put the United States in a touchy position , as it is close allies with both Iraq and Turkey , and a long offensive along the border could jeopardize security in Iraq just as the U.S. is trying to stabilize the war - wracked country .
" It should not be long - lasting , " Bush said .
" The Turks need to move , move quickly , achieve their objective and get out . "
He also said , though , that it is in no one 's interest for the PKK to have safe havens .
A reporter asked Bush if he would characterize recent comments made by Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama regarding Iraq as " naive , " but the president refused to wade too far into the race to succeed him .
" As commander in chief , I will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for American interests , " Obama said at an Ohio debate on Tuesday .
" And if al - Qaida is forming a base in Iraq , then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad . "
On Wednesday , Republican presidential hopeful John McCain mocked Obama over his statement , and drew laughter at a rally in Texas by telling the junior senator , " I have some news .
Al - Qaida is in Iraq .
It 's called `al - Qaida in Iraq . "
Obama quickly answered back , telling a rally at Ohio State University in Columbus , " I do know that al - Qaida is in Iraq .
So I have some news for John McCain , " he added , saying there was no al - Qaida presence in Iraq until President Bush invaded the country .
Noting that McCain likes to tell audiences that he'd follow Osama bin Laden to the " gates of hell " to catch him , Obama taunted : " All he ( McCain ) has done is to follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq .
Bush did advise Obama that he " better stay focused " on his campaign with Senator Hillary Clinton , since the Democratic presidential race has n't been decided yet .
( with wire reports )
Men are n’t romantic for the same reason we did n’t invent a sport called “ Drop Rocks in a Hole . ”
What ’s going to happen next ?
Is the rock going to fall in the hole ?
Holy shit !
Who wins ?
No one .
It ’s just like listening to a woman .
Everyone loses .
To women , “ romance ” is a heavily regulated choreograph of candles and shiny trinkets .
Romance is flowers on Valentine ’s Day .
It ’s remembering her favorite song after she ’s told you twenty times and also put it as her ringtone .
Romance is serving her a half - assed birthday breakfast in bed , or otherwise walking , not running , through a gauntlet of figurative cones like a dog for no discernible purpose other than to say you did it — and that you did it for her .
Romance means giving a woman things of no worth just so she ’ll put out .
Diamonds are n’t worth shit .
Neither are flowers .
An explanation of how Anti-lock Brake Systems work is worth something .
A lesson on how maps work , no matter how condescending it is , is worth something .
No woman on Earth will put out for either of those .
Men devised algebra and calculus to explain where we are in the cosmos .
We discovered fire and nuclear power .
We put a man on the moon .
Putting fifty dollars on the charge card and running a bath does not rank in the universe of interesting things to do with our time .
If it ’s so easy , why are n’t men more romantic ?
Like usual , the problem lies with women .
Women are simple creatures .
To them , flowers showing up on the same day every year is a complicated fucking marvel like a comet would be to a primitive monkey - man .
Put yourself in the place of a woman for a moment .
None of them know how to call a plumber or a Pizza Hut , so they have no idea where the flowers came from .
And fuck getting a job or having any money .
Women have two settings when it comes to doing anything in their lives .
Either it ’s impossible , or it ’s something she ’s doing already .
That ’s why women bitch instead of educating themselves or getting job skills for when their nagged - to - death husband dumps their fat ass .
If she ’s not already doing it , then it ’s impossible .
Men are n’t “ romantic ” because being romantic means insulting the women we love .
I would n’t feed my dog the same treat at the same time every day of it ’s life .
At best , that ’s insulting to my dog ’s intelligence , and at worst that ’s a sick kind of emotional manipulation akin to Chinese water torture .
That ’s what women want though : flowers , candy , and attention in ways that are so predictable and contrived , they belong in a psychology experiment .
Our ladies deserve better than that .
And since they ca n’t muster up any self - respect on their own , we men have to do it for them .
I ’m a man .
I ’ll slay a dragon to get laid .
But if the next dragon does n’t have a Rubik ’s cube for a face or something to assemble on it ’s back , it can go fuck itself .
Doing the same shit over and over again is tedious .
Romance is coloring between the lines with invisible crayons .
And do n’t tell me that laundry , cooking , and cleaning are tedious , like a she - octopus shooting mouth - ink all over the place in desperation .
Women love all three of those things .
Have n’t you seen how happy they look in the commercials ?

FIVE TRADING DAYS FIVE TRADING DAYS
Dow Jones industrial average , five days NEW YORK  Wall Street remains skittish but is showing signs of budding investor optimism .
After plunging in early trading , stocks closed mixed as investors snapped up bargains on rumors a bond insurer rescue plan and upbeat comments from Cisco Systems and Amazon.com . .
Earlier Tuesday , the market sank after Merrill Lynch lowered its full - year earnings prediction for Citigroup ( C ) and Intel ( INTC ) lowered its forecast for first - quarter profit margins .
At one point , the major indexes each gave up more than 1 % , with the Dow Jones industrial average falling about 150 points Merrill Lynch reduced its full - year prediction for Citigroup because it believes the bank could write down another $ 18 billion of debt tied to souring mortgages , according to Dow Jones Newswires .
The stock , one of the 30 companies in the Dow , fell to new nine - year lows , and took other financial stocks down with it .
Meanwhile , Intel 's decision to lower its forecast heightened worries about the technology industry .
Chipmakers are considered an early warning system for troubles throughout the sector .
But in afternoon trading , the stock market showed signs of optimism .
At the close , the Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.10 , or 0.37 % , to 12,213.80 .
In the broader market , the Standard & Poor 's 500 index fell 4.59 , or 0.34 % , to 1,326.75 , and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.68 , or 0.07 % , to 2,260.28 .
The financial sector regained some steam after CNBC reported that a plan to save the bond insurer Ambac Financial is advancing nicely .
Technology stocks rebounded , too , after a Dow Jones Newswires report that Cisco CEO John Chambers said he is " even more comfortable " with the long - term growth targets the company has outlined , and after Amazon.com 's chief financial officer reiterated the online retailer 's 2008 revenue forecast .
Wall Street is jittery , however , and as the volatility of the past several months has proved , the market 's optimism can quickly turn to pessimism from one day to the next .
While some investors search for bargains when stocks sink , the overall market is plagued by persistent worries about the bad debt held by the world 's banks .
" What we 're seeing is a very nervous market , and nervousness breeds volatility , " said Anthony Conroy , managing director and head trader for BNY ConvergEx Group .
" It took years to put this stuff on their books — it 's not going to come off quickly . "
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke arned in a speech in Florida Tuesday that more home foreclosures are coming .
Meanwhile , Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn in prepared remarks to U.S. senators said banks face obstacles , but their cash levels are strong enough to face them .
The disappointing earnings forecasts and comments from Fed officials come as Wall Street tries to determine whether the economy is in recession — and whether investors have been a bit too optimistic about companies ' profits bouncing back in the second half of the year .
" The soft economy creates a difficult profit environment for most firms .
And with investors ' skepticism at high levels , they are quick to sell , " said Alan Gayle , senior investment strategist at Trusco Capital Management .
Overseas , Japan 's Nikkei stock average edged up less than 0.01 % .
In afternoon trading , Britain 's FTSE 100 fell 1.2 % , Germany 's DAX index fell 1.3 % , and France 's CAC - 40 declined 1.1 % .

Thinking Of Mathematics
 An Essay On Eyes - free Computing T. V. Raman
Google Research
http://emacspeak.sf.net/raman
raman@google.com
Abstract
This essay outlines some of my experiences as a mathematician who cannot see .
Note that I transitioned to being a Computer Scientist during Graduate School .
However I strongly believe in the edict  Once a mathematician , always a mathematician !  my training in mathematics continues to inﬂuence the way I think .
Ive been unable to see since the age of 14 , which means that Ive studied and practiced mathematics predominantly in an eyes - free environment .
This essay is my ﬁrst conscious attempt at asking the question  What is involved in doing mathematics when you cannot see ? 
I hope that some of the experiences outlined here will prove insightful to mathematicians at large .
At its heart , mathematics is about understanding the underlying structure inherent in a given area of interest and where no such structure exists to deﬁne the minimal structure that is needed to make forward progress .
The general perception that mathematics might be hard to do in an eyes - free environment probably traces itself to the common view of mathematics as a ﬁeld where one performs copious calculations on paper .
Ill illustrate some of the habits and abilities one evolves over time to compensate for the lack of ready access to scratch memory provided by pencil and paper when working in an eyes - free environment .
In this essay , I hope to demonstrate that mathematics in its essence is something far bigger .
By being bigger than calculations on paper , not being able to see rarely if ever proves an obstacle when it comes to doing mathematics ; the challenges one needs to overcome are primarily centered around gaining access to mathematical material , and communicating ones insights with fellow mathematicians .
Thus , a large portion of this essay focuses on solutions to the challenges inherent in mathematical communication .
1 Creativity
The phases involved in the creative process were ﬁrst described by German physiologist Herman Helmholtz in the late nineteenth century .
He identiﬁed three stages of creativity :
saturation ,
, incubation and
and illumination
see Promoting Creativity .
These three stages have since been augmented with the additional step of veriﬁcation by the scientiﬁc community .
When I started working on this essay , I found it useful to ask what impact if any my not being able to see had had on each of these stages within the creative process when studying or doing mathematics .
This introductory section brieﬂy summarizes my answers to this question  the remaining sections present a detailed analysis based on my experience of working on speciﬁc problems .
Saturation
At this stage , one focuses on gaining a good grasp of the problem context .
Given that a lot of mathematical literature is only available in print , this stage can be a challenge , especially when it comes to higher - level mathematics .
But to do higher - level mathematics , one ﬁrst needs to do elementary mathematics , and I believe that it is even more important to ﬁnd the right kind of help when one is beginning to learn .
I believe I gained a signiﬁcant advantage here by virtue of having an elder brother who was a highly motivated teacher .
The challenge of gaining access to higher - level mathematics might appear to be the more complex of the two ; however I believe that proper access at the introductory level is far more critical , since good access at this stage ensures that a student with the necessary mathematical aptitude remains within the ﬁeld to go on and solve the challenges that lie beyond .
Incubation Having absorbed the relevant material , this stage involves trying different approaches to making forward progress .
In my experience , not being able to see has little or or no negative impact at this stage ; in fact it might actually be an advantage since one has fewer distractions .
Illumination
Not being able to see should not have any negatives at this stage .
In practice , I have often found that I fall into the hole of false illumination i.e. , concluding that I have solved the problem when I have not fully done so .
This can often be attributed to failures within the saturation step e.g. , missing a key portion of the problem statement , or pursuing an incorrect approach that has been tried and dismissed by others in the past .
As the world of mathematics goes digital , I believe that tools like Google Scholar will serve to level the playing ﬁeld in this regard .
Veriﬁcation
The veriﬁcation step is closely connected with being able to reliably communicate mathematical ideas with ones peers .
At this stage , it s important to be able to communicate with other mathematicians traditionally , this meant writing with a piece of chalk .
The move to electronic communication , and the invention of mathematical notation like T E X comes to the rescue here .
The T E X notation scales  T E X keeps writing simple math simple , while being capable of encoding complex material .
Thanks to T E X , I can communicate mathematical ideas via email most mathematicians can read T E X math  I can also produce beautifully typeset mathematics when I have something more signiﬁcant to convey .
2 First Experience  A Mental Calendar
I was 15 and couldnt see any more ; I realized I couldnt look at a print calendar to ﬁnd out the day of the week .
I also had time on my hands …
I decided that an interesting problem to solve would be to ﬁgure out how to tell the day of the week given the date .
I had always been good with numbers , and at the time I was 15 years old and felt I knew enough mathematics to be able to work out the solution .
What s more , the possibility of being able to tell the day given any date seemed far more useful than being able to look at the print calendar for any given year .
Saturation
In this case , grasping the problem at hand did not require extensive reading a lucky coincidence since I had no means of reading any material that I might have needed .
The facts needed for gaining insight into the problem were ready to hand .
After all , even though I couldnt look at a print calendar , I always knew what day of the week it was today moreover , by counting either backwards or forwards , I could also ﬁgure out the day of the week for nearby dates .
Once I started down this path , the answer to the ﬁrst question I asked myself
What is the reason for the 1st of every month not being the same day of the week ?
became readily apparent given two dates , the change in the day of the week is given by taking the number of intervening days , and obtaining the remainder modulo7 .
As an example , January 1 1980 ( the year I did this ) was a Tuesday ; I could conjecture that February 1 , 1980 would be a Friday , and readily conﬁrm that my understanding was correct because I could check the following facts :
January 1 , 1980 was a Tuesday .
February 1 , 1980 was a Friday .
January has 31 days , and 31 % 7 = 3 .
Thus , the saturation phase did not present an obstacle ; what s more , being forced to count forward / backwards while understanding the problem meant I had a leg up with entering the incubation phase .
Incubation
The incubation phase did not last very long in this instance .
Given that I had already started down the path of using modulo 7 arithmetic , I already had the essence of the algorithm at my ﬁngertips given a date , do the following :
Compute the number of intervening days d from today .
from today .
Compute d % 7 .
% .
Use this offset from today to obtain the answer .
Illumination
Though the above steps do give the answer , computing d  the number of intervening days between January 1 and any given date is cumbersome .
I therefore spent some time computing the day of the week for convenient dates e.g. , January 1 .
As I did this , I found computing the number of intervening days between January 1 and any date in the same year cumbersome .
But by then I had sufficient insight into the problem to realize that I could apply the previous technique to compute the day for the ﬁrst of each month .
So most of the incubation phase was spent getting better at modulo 7 arithmetic , and deciding what bits I would need to remember as opposed to computing on the ﬂy .
I eventually arrived at the following :
A year has 365 days .
365 % 7 = 1 , and so January 1 moves by one day each year ( and by 2 for a leap year .
days . % , and so January 1 moves by one day each year ( and by for a leap year .
Compute a list of 12 numbers that each give the remainder d % 7 at the beginning of each month .
numbers that each give the remainder % at the beginning of each month .
Compute the day of the week for January 1 at the turn of each century to make calculations easy .
So here is what I still use to look at the calendar .
Let Sunday be 0 .
The table of offsets for the 12 months ( assuming February has 28 days ) is obtained by computing d%7 for each month where d is the number of intervening days between the ﬁrst of the month and January 1 .
Thus , the offset for January is 0 .
The offset for month m is given by
Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 31 28 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31 0 3 3 6 1 4 6 2 5 0 3 5
Given a date ( m , d , y ) , compute w = M 7 + d 7 + y 7 , where :
m 7 is the offset for the month obtained by looking up the month in the table of offsets .
is the offset for the month obtained by looking up the month in the table of offsets .
d 7 = d % 7 .
% . Let yy = y - 1900 then y 7 = ( y + y / 4 ) % 7 .
The offset for the year 1900 is 0 since January 1 that year was a Monday  the offsets at the turn of the century cycle through ( 6,4,2,0 ) .
Notice that the above computation adds in the extra day for leap years for all dates .
Since the extra day is in fact added in at the end of February , the w computed above needs to be decremented by 1 when working with dates in January and February of a leap year .
Veriﬁcation
Veriﬁcation in this instance turned into a fun party trick turns out that most people remember the day of the week for signiﬁcant days in their life , and whats more , always ask you to verify their special day .
They are also quick to tell you when you re wrong , which means you get an opportunity to both verify the algorithm , as well as checking your own ability to apply it successfully .
3 Solving The Rubiks Cube
I learnt Braille when I was 17 .
The Rubiks Cube came to India around the same time , and marking a Rubiks Cube with Braille dots was the ﬁrst useful thing I did with my newly acquired ability .
Saturation
I ﬁrst heard of the Rubiks Cube on the BBCs Science In Action growing up , the BBC World Service was something I listened to all the time .
It took a few more months before the cube arrived in India sometime in early 1982 which is also when I learnt Braille .
My initial exposure to the cube came via observing everyone around struggling to solve it and failing  this in itself was sufficiently motivating to want to solve it .
I started by placing my ﬁnger on a given facelet of an unmarked cube and observing how it moved as I turned the various faces .
At this stage , not being able to see the colors on the cube probably saved me from getting just as confused as everyone else around me .
It also gave me the somewhat false impression that this wasnt going to be very difficult a lucky misconception because it also meant that I did not get discouraged early on .
As I began to discover patterns of movement on the cube , I felt the need to remember some of these patterns so that I could connect different things I discovered on the cube .
I also discovered that it was important to hold the cube in a ﬁxed orientation otherwise I found myself getting very confused .
I soon started referring to the bottom face as 1 , the front face as 2 and the left face as 3 .
Whenever I discovered a sequence of face turns that I could predictably apply to move a facelet from a given position to another without disturbing its neighbours , I started associating a string of digits to that sequence .
Notice that as a notation this was in fact incomplete it fails to record the direction ( clockwise vs counter - clockwise ) that a face is being turned .
But it was a key step in the saturation stage as I came to grips with the puzzle .
Still working with an unmarked cube , I also discovered the difference between edge cubelets ( pieces that have two colors on them ) vs corner cubelets ( pieces that have three colors ) .
I also realized that the face centers did not move at all , and were responsible for determining the color of a face .
Since I was doing this by carefully holding a ﬁngertip on a chosen piece , I also arrived at the useful insight that it was important to solve the cube a layer at a time and not a face at a time .
Incubation
The incubation stage in this instance lasted almost a week from memory .
Placing a ﬁngertip on a piece and observing its motion was a good means of gaining insight into the puzzle .
But as I made progress in that direction , things also got more and more confusing since I was now trying to do more complex steps .
After doing complex hand contortions where I tried to track multiple pieces by placing different ﬁngers on the pieces to track while attempting to turn cube faces , I realized that I needed tactile markers on the cube faces to make further progress .
At this point , my brother marked a Rubiks Cube with Braille stickers .
We left the white face blank , and stuck small squares of relatively thick polythene marked with different Braille symbols on the 5 remaining faces .
I now got to experience ﬁrst - hand why everyone else around me was so confused by the cube .
But my earlier explorations during the saturation face had helped me build up an intuitive feel for how things worked .
Needless to say , I was able to correct many of my prior misconceptions .
I also ﬁxed up my primitive notational system for remembering commonly occurring sequences  I attached ± to the digits to denote the direction in which a face was being turned .
At this point , I believe I had achieved parity with respect to attempting to solve the cube i.e. , not being able to see did not matter any more .
From here on , my arriving at the solution went through the same sequence of effort , frustration and eventual success that everyone goes through when confronted with the cube .
Illumination
A week after marking the cube with Braille dots , I had an end - to - end solution that I believed worked .
Given a randomly mixed cube , I went about it by :
Start with the blank ( white ) face identiﬁed by its center on top .
Move the edge cubelets of the top layer into position .
Move the corner cubelets of this layer into position .
Move the edge cubelets that made up the second layer into position .
Move the corner cubelets on the bottom layer into their slots .
Move the edge cubelets in the bottom layer into position .
Orient the edge and corner cubelets correctly on the bottom layer .
Veriﬁcation
After claiming to have solved the cube , and reliably solving it a few times , I got my ﬁrst rude surprise someone mixed it up and I found I reached a conﬁguration for which I had not worked out a reliable sequence of moves .
Thus , in this case veriﬁcation was iterative .
The problem was that I had missed the possibility that one can place a pair of cubes in the bottom layer in their home position and still have the other pair swapped .
By this time , I was sufficiently well - versed in the secrets of the cube to derive the sequence of moves needed to dig myself out of this hole .
After ﬁnally learning to solve the cube , I spent the subsequent months deriving different shortcuts that allowed me to move multiple pieces into position in parallel eventually I could solve the cube on average in under 30 seconds .
I even relaxed one of my early constraints having to hold the cube in a ﬁxed orientation when I solved the cube one - handed .
Solving a Braille cube one - handed is an interesting challenge because I was using the same hand to both feel the Braille markers and turn the cube faces .
Doing this requires physically orienting the cube in your hand so that you can turn a given face ; this means that your mental model of the cube needs to account at each stage for a completely re-oriented cube .
Insights
Discovering the algorithm for computing the day given a date as well as solving the cube did not require doing mathematics in the traditional sense .
Neither required me to access signiﬁcant amounts of existing mathematical literature .
When I had arrived at the solution , communicating the result was also easy .
Thus , the two steps where not being able to see could potentially get in the way were in fact easy .
At the same time , not being able to see helped me focus on the problem to a greater extent than I otherwise might have ; additionally , I might not have been as motivated if I had been able to see .
4 Devising An Efficient Braille Notation For Math
I spent a year attempting to chase down the Nemeth Braille code for writing Math .
I ﬁnally gave up and created my own in the summer of 1983 …
Saturation
During my ﬁrst year of school after learning Braille , I tried in vain to chase down the Nemeth code for writing math in Braille .
This was 1982 in India , i.e. , before the global availability of email .
After mailing out many letters with nothing to show for it , I spent the summer of 1983 designing a math notation that I could use for taking class notes in Braille .
Here are some of the requirements that went into this design :
Succinct
The notation had to be sufficiently succinct to enable me to write at classroom speeds using a pocket slate .
Extensible
The system had to be extensible to enable me to invent notation on the ﬂy as I encountered new concepts and their accompanying mathematical notation in class .
Speed
The notation had to be sufficiently concise to enable someone like myself who had learnt Braille late in life to read fast .
This meant minimizing the number of dots it took to write something that meshed well with the goal of succinctness fewer dots are both quicker to read and write !
Incubation
I experienced ﬁrst - hand what it meant to study mathematics without access to a good reading / writing system during the 1982 academic year .
I was in the 11th grade , and relied exclusively on my brother to read me textbooks .
I gave written exams with a writer a student who would read me the question and write down the answer as I dictated .
This necessarily forced me to practice solving problems a step at a time and dictating each step to the writer .
Solving problems in this mode is distinct from solving math problems mentally .
Notice that the presence of the writer meant that I did have access to scratch memory of sorts .
Dictating each step to the writer , having it read back to conﬁrm that it had been written correctly , and proceeding to the next step meant that I needed to use mental calculation only for individual steps .
This actually required a fair bit of practice since it was always tempting to try to solve problems in calculus or trigonometry end - to - end and then dictate the solution .
In practice this is both error - prone and unnecessary especially given an exam system that focuses on the students ability to ﬁnish a given number of problems in the allotted time .
Illumination
The abilities I developed during the academic year 1982 1983 served me well on two counts .
The ability to break down a problem and work through it systematically is more broadly useful than when taking timed exams with a writer .
Secondly , my experience that year helped me implicitly understand the design requirements enumerated earlier for my ideal Braille notation for mathematics .
I spent the summer of 1983 designing such a system and continued to use the result throughout my student career .
The Braille notation I developed had the following features :
Phonetic
To meet the succinctness requirement , I ﬁrst created myself a phonetic shorthand in Braille .
A Braille cell has 6 dots arranged in a 3 × 2 matrix to give 63 distinct symbols .
The shorthand I devised dropped all vowels , and used different symbols for commonly occurring syllables .
Further , the position of a symbol within a word changed the syllable that it denoted .
As an example , the Braille character obtained by using the two dots in the bottom row of the 3 × 2 matrix denoted the syllable pr at the front of a word ; it denoted the syllable cy at the end of a word .
I therefore wrote the word pricy by repeating this character .
Writing the word pricy in standard Braille would take 5 characters comprised of ( 4,4,2,2,5 ) = 17 dots .
In comparison my shorthand could encode the same word with 2 characters that used ( 2,2 ) = 4 dots .
Math Escapes
Braille is essentially a linear writing system later , I came to appreciate that computer - based writing systems like T E X are also linear .
To encode two - dimensional math notation , I assigned particular Braille symbols to denote the start of subscripts or superscripts  I later came to recognize these as escape sequences when I learnt computer science .
I used parentheses to group sub-expressions .
I used a special symbol to precede English letters to denote that the symbol was the Greek equivalent as a computer scientist , I now recognize this as placing a symbol in a new namespace .
Veriﬁcation
I started using the resulting Braille codes in class during the academic year 1983  84 and to my surprise it worked very well .
I had been taught to write with my right - hand when I was very young .
I suspect that if left to my own devices , I would have written with my left - hand since I could see with my left eye .
When I learnt Braille , this too turned into an advantage  I started reading Braille with my left hand .
The ability to write right - handed while being able to read with my left - hand meant that I could read and write in parallel something that proved quite useful when doing mathematics .
Both the Braille writing system I devised as well as the divide and conquer strategy for problem solving during exams scaled well .
I invented new symbols as I learnt more mathematics and encountered newer notation ; but the underlying notational system never changed .
When I encountered new concepts and associated new notation in class , I always asked what the visual notation was , and then invented a Braille notation that best matched .
This also made it easy for me to remember the visual notation ( which I would need to know when dictating my exams ) .
As an example , when I ﬁrst encountered group theory , the notation for group 〈 G , +〉 was described to me in class as
G , + enclosed in angle brackets
I automatically chose the Braille symbols I had previously used for < and > as a new pair of delimiters .
For the record , I always sat in front of the class and insisted that every instructor spoke as they wrote on the blackboard further , I was never shy if I heard the squeak of a chalk without an accompanying utterance from the person at the board .
Similarly , the strategy of solving written problems a step at a time and using the previously written step to provide scratch memory also scaled from high - school calculus to college - level mathematics .
As an example , I took a class on Linear Programming in college and still have unpleasant memories of having to solve transportation problems using the Vogels Approximation Method in timed exams .
These experiences gave me two key insights that have served me well :
Speciﬁc mathematical techniques e.g. , differentiation , integration or the Simplex method are algorithms .
differentiation , integration or the Simplex method are algorithms .
To truly appreciate an algorithm and understand how it works , one needs to be able to run it by hand on a representative set of examples .
it by hand on a representative set of examples .
In mathematics , this translates to being able to differentiate or integrate a given expression .
The latter requires a set of semi-mechanical steps and this is where one uses aids such as scratch memory provided by pencil and paper something for which I needed to compensate .
steps and this is where one uses aids such as memory provided by pencil and paper something for which I needed to compensate .
However , a true understanding of the underlying algorithm is far more important than any speciﬁc technique that one might devise for running the algorithm on speciﬁc instances .
5 Learning To Program
Asked to program a game in CS 101 , I expressed the game as a recurrence equation and solved it it made for a very short program that always won the game …
Saturation
I was asked to program the following two - person nimm - type game for a ﬁnal class assignment .
Here are the rules :
The game starts with n sticks on the table , with each player taking turns to pick up k sticks .
sticks on the table , with each player taking turns to pick up sticks .
The ﬁrst player can pick up at most n - 1 sticks .
sticks .
Assume that a player picks k sticks at a given turn .
Then his opponent can pick up at most 2 k sticks .
sticks at a given turn .
Then his opponent can pick up at most sticks .
The player who picks up the last set of sticks wins .
We had been taught the technique of searching through game trees in class and were expected to use this to complete the assignment .
To provide some additional context , CS 101 students at IIT were assigned limited amounts of computer time typically 60 minutes slots between the hours of 10 pm and 5 am .
I used to program by taking along a student to read the display for me .
Incubation
I was highly motivated to devise a solution that would not require me to go multiple times in the middle of the night to the computer room to implement a solution .
I like sleeping early and well , and ﬁnding willing volunteers in the middle of the night is not easy .
The problem description was simple , and not being able to see was not a shortcoming at the saturation stage .
It turned out to be a signiﬁcant advantage during the incubation phase .
While the rest of my peers begged and borrowed additional computer time to implement a game - tree based solution , I spent my time thinking about the problem in the relative comfort of my dorm room .
Analyzing the game , I simulated it for small values of n and discovered the following :
The game is meaningless for n = 1 .
.
If n = 2 the ﬁrst player loses .
the ﬁrst player loses .
If n = 3 , ﬁrst player loses .
, ﬁrst player loses .
If you play two successive games ( n 1 , n 2 ) , where the ﬁrst player is guaranteed to lose each game , then the ﬁrst player can be forced to lose for n = n 1 + n 2 .
As I jotted down the numbers ( 1,2,3,2 + 3 = 5 ) , and observed above facts , I spotted the Fibonacci sequence .
I initially conjectured that the ﬁrst player would always lose if n was a Fibonacci number .
This then indicated a possible winning strategy ; if n is a Fibonacci number , ask the opponent to go ﬁrst ; if not , play ﬁrst and pick k sticks such that n - k is the closest Fibonacci number .
Illumination And Veriﬁcation
There remained but one twist to complete the solution  the rule that said you could pick at most 2 k sticks at each turn .
Consider n = 12 .
This is not a Fibonacci number ; however naïvelyapplying the strategy would suggest picking k = 4 sticks to leave a remainder of 8 sticks  this allows the second player to win .
So I went back to the initial strategy of decomposing larger games into smaller ones .
Given n = 12 , consider it as a pair of games ( 4,8 ) .
You go ﬁrst , and win the game for n = 4 by forcing the opponent to the closest Fibonacci number 3 .
When this game for n = 4 concludes , the opponent is left to start the next game with n = 8 which is guaranteed to lose .
My ﬁnal submission consisted of a 40 line Fortran program accompanied by a two - page proof that I typed out on a portable typewriter .
Given the size of the program , it only took me one 30 minute session in the computer room to ﬁnish the assignment .
Looking back , I believe not being able to see gave me a signiﬁcant advantage over my fellow students in this instance .
Communicating the solution was an interesting challenge , since I did not have access to or know anything about mathematical typesetting .
The proof I wrote up was therefore mostly in plain English .
But the implementation that went along with the proof was the clinching argument  the program beat everyone who played against it .
6 AS TE R Speaking Mathematics
I obtained my ﬁrst talking computer during the second semester of Grad School at Cornell and learnt ( LA ) TEX .
Then , I found that the computer couldnt speak the math I was writing …
I took CS 681 , the graduate class on algorithms at Cornell in the fall semester of 1990 .
The instructor , Dexter Kozen , was using lecture notes typeset in ( LA ) TEX .
Since I had a computer that could talk , I asked him for the ( LA ) TEX sources .
After listening to the speech synthesizer speak ( LA ) TEX code for a few days , I decided that I could make it do far better  this eventually led to the work on audio formatting and my PhD thesis entitled AS TE R  Audio System For Technical Readings .
Saturation
In a sense , the saturation stage for this problem had begun long before .
Over time , I had learnt to recruit enthusiastic student volunteers to read math material for me , and this required training readers in efficiently speaking complex mathematics .
I conceived the idea of getting the computer to speak ( LA ) TEX documents at the same time that I learnt ( LA ) TEX a key step in the saturation stage .
I learnt TEX by reading the raw sources for the TEX book ; later , I obtained the ( LA ) TEX sources to the LATEX book from Leslie Lamport at DEC Research .
This was a case of jumping in at the deep end reading the TEX sources to the TEX book is not the easiest way to learn TEX .
However , the TEX sources were readily available , and once I had overcome the initial hurdle of listening to the TEX markup , I learnt TEX to a far deeper level than I otherwise might have .
This might not have been necessary if all I had needed to do was to author TEX documents ; but a full understanding of the TEX machinery served me well when it came to implementing a system that consumed ( LA ) TEX documents to produce rich auditory renderings .
I spent the summer of 1991 at Xerox PARC as a summer intern in the Electronic Documents Lab .
This proved to be an excellent environment to absorb the background knowledge in document understanding and electronic documents that I would need to implement the ﬁnal system .
Looking back , I believe this experience helped me work around some of the lack of access to relevant literature that might have otherwise held me back in building the right system .
Incubation
The system I built was primarily motivated by my own desire to read math publications .
This meant that I had a signiﬁcant leg up during the incubation phase being the systems primary customer meant that the feedback loop between conceiving , implementing and testing out different ideas was extremely tight .
In 1990 , I published an early write - up in TugBoat on the predecessor to AS TE R a simple SED script called TE XTA LK that transformed ( LA ) TEX documents .
An interesting side - beneﬁt of this write - up was that it put me in touch with the TEX community and in particular Barbara Beaton of the AMS ; she provided me access to AMS Bulletins in ( LA ) TEX that I used as input to early prototypes of AS TE R .
By the middle of 1992 , I was well into the incubation phase and ready to implement AS TE R. I chose Common Lisp Object System ( CLOS ) as the implementation language .
I was still learning to program in the large , and AS TE R was the ﬁrst signiﬁcant software system that I implemented .
This meant that I was learning on the job and needed access to the relevant reference material .
By then , I had discovered that I could email authors asking for access to the markup sources of books I really needed .
Usually , a brief description of the project I was working on , followed by a letter from the publisher granting the author permission to give me the ﬁles was all that was needed .
usually I received ( LA ) TEX ﬁles which also became input for the system I was building .
Here are some of the programming books I used in this form :
Structure And Interpretation Of Computer Programs ( SICP ) by Abelsen and Sussman .
Paradigms of AI Programming by Peter Norvig
The Common Lisp ANSI speciﬁcation
I augmented these with excellent online support from Usenet group comp.lang.lisp .
Illumination
In summer of 1992 , I picked David Gries as my Phd adviser .
After I described the system I was trying to build , he thought about it and said
First design a language in which you can describe how you want documents to be spoken .
It took me a week to appreciate the import of this suggestion  but looking back , this was the ﬁnal breakthrough that made AS TE R a workable solution .
The rest was relatively easy :
I had the necessary test material in the form of electronic books .
I had the resources I needed to teach myself to program .
I had the end - user ( myself ) to test the system on .
Veriﬁcation
AS TE R was implemented during the calendar year 1992 and by early 1993 , I had started testing the efficacy of the auditory renderings by having people in the CS department at Cornell write down equations as they heard it spoken by the system .
I declared the system complete once it reached a level where users correctly wrote down what they heard .
The ﬁnal test was to collect a set of mutually ambiguous examples , have these rendered by AS TE R , and compare the result to the recording produced by a trained reader from Recordings For the Blind  Chuck Romine of the Oakridge Tennessee Labs volunteered to produce a suitable cassette tape .
I built AS TE R as a tool for reading mathematical documents .
But how about tools for writing mathematics ?
Despite What You See Is What You Get ( WYSIWYG ) systems being the present rage , I believe that ( LA ) TEX markup is still the best option for writing mathematics when you cannot see .
Here are some reasons why :
The results of ( L A ) T E X markup are predictable .
As someone who cannot see the visual output , I never want to risk getting what I didnt see by using a WYSIWYG system .
) markup are predictable .
As someone who cannot see the visual output , I never want to risk getting what I didnt see by using a WYSIWYG system .
( L A ) T E X linearizes the two - dimensional math notation .
It is hard to understand that linear notation when you are also trying to understand the underlying mathematics being communicated ; this is why mathematicians format their ( L A ) T E X documents to produce good visual copy .

) so that the listener could focus on the math being communicated .
When you are writing down something you already understand , the linearized ( L A ) T E X does not prove as signiﬁcant a cognitive burden , and given the drawbacks in WYSIWYG systems mentioned earlier , ( L A ) T E X remains an attractive authoring solution .
As an aside , the inventor of TEX Donald E Knuth mentioned to me when we met at the TUG95 conference that TEX math notation had itself been motivated by how mathematicians speak expressions when conversing with one another .
Thus , x ˘1 + x ˘2 closely matches what a mathematician would say :
x sub 1 plus x sub 2
A few years earlier , Brian Kernighan , the inventor of EQN told me that the notation he invented was informed to an extent by his experience of recording math books for Recordings For The Blind in Princeton .
I believe that this is more than a coincidence simple linearization of two - dimensional mathematical notation as embodied by systems like TEX will probably remain one of the most effective means for mathematicians to communicate math to the machine , since they appear to closely mirror how we think at least at the linguistic level .
7 Zome Systems  Rediscovering Mathematics
I discovered Zome Systems in 1999 my only regret is that I did not have it when I was a student …
I started implementing AS TE R because I found math publications difficult to read in 1990 it was because listening to ( LA ) TEX markup took too much away from focusing on the mathematical content .
When I had ﬁnished implementing AS TE R in the fall of 1993 , I had a system that spoke publications from AMS Bulletins very well but I still couldnt understand them since I had lost touch with math .
I rediscovered many of the things I enjoyed about Mathematics after coming into contact with Zome Systems in late 1999 a polyhedral building set that leverages the symmetries of the dodecahedron / icosahedron .
I think Zome Systems makes a wonderful teaching aid for students and even more so for students who cannot see .
Saturation
On the surface , Zome appears to be a very visual toy  the sticks are color coded .
But like any well - designed system , Zome sports a high level of redundancy  the sticks are also shape - coded .
Understanding the geometry of the Zome ball during the saturation phase presented interesting challenges .
The Zome ball has three types of holes pentagonal , triangular and rectangular .
The ball is therefore ﬂatter at the pentagonal holes , and as a consequence , if you roll the ball between ﬁnger and thumb , it usually comes to rest with a pentagonal hole against the ﬁngertip .
Once I understood this , the next step was to fully populate a zome ball with sticks of a given color blue ( ﬂat ) , yellow ( triangular ) and red ( pentagonal ) sticks go into the appropriately shaped holes .
Fully populating a Zome ball with a given type of stick makes it easier to perceive the underlying geometry via touch since this effectively increases the resolution .
After buying my ﬁrst Zome kit at Linuxworld 1999 , I looked it up on the Web and found many Web sites describing its underlying geometry primary among these being George Harts site on Zome geometry .
Later , he provided me online access to his book on this subject .
Incubation
During this phase , I built several fun models including many that I had studied in the context of abstract algebra and group theory .
My permanent favorites among these are :
The compound of 5 cubes .
cubes .
The compound of 5 tetrahedra .
tetrahedra .
The compound of 5 rhombic dodecahedra .
In addition , the highly symmetric rhombic triacontahedron is a favorite that shows up in the context of all of the above models .
Illumination And Veriﬁcation
After a couple of years of playing with Zome Systems , I put together a paper describing some of the things that could be learnt with my co-author Krishnamoorthy see Visual Techniques For Computing Polyhedral Volumes .
I authored this material ( including all ﬁgures ) in ( LA ) TEX .
The ﬁgures were drawn using package pstricks .
I worked with my co-author in ( LA ) TEX with email being the primary form of communication .
This is a good example of ( LA ) TEX providing a common language and thereby bridgeing the communication gap that I would face if I still needed to use a piece of chalk to communicate my ideas .
8 Writing This Essay
To iterate is human , to recur divine …
To conclude , let us apply the overall framework of this article to the creation of this essay .

BBC News , Sydney
If humans react like mice , the find could help develop fat - burning drugs Australian scientists believe they may have discovered how to help people lose weight without cutting back on food .
Researchers in Melbourne found that by manipulating fat cells in mice they were able to speed up metabolism .
After removing a particular enzyme , scientists found the mice were able to eat the same amount as others but burn more calories and gain less weight .
The breakthrough could pave the way for fat - burning drugs and also help to combat diabetes .
The research found that mice in which the angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) had been removed were , on average , 20 % lighter than normal mice and had up to 60 % less body fat .
All the evidence we have is that nothing works better than a healthy diet and increased physical activity , with or without weight loss drugs
Dr Ian Campbell
Weight Concern Because of their faster metabolisms , it also appeared they had less chance of developing diabetes because they processed sugar more quickly .
Drugs which impair the action of ACE in humans already exist , and are used to combat high blood pressure .
The latest research could help the development of weight loss pills .
The question is whether they will have the same slimming effect on people as they have done on mice .
Dr Ian Campbell , medical director of the charity Weight Concern , said the study was " interesting " , but stressed the work had only been carried out in mice .
He also said that although ACE inhibitor drugs were widely used to treat high blood pressure , there was nothing to indicate that , even at high doses , they encouraged weight loss in humans .
In addition , although the drugs were generally safe , they did carry a risk of side effects , such as kidney damage .
Dr Campbell said : " The promise that one will be able to eat more and not gain weight is unlikely to be fulfilled .
" All the evidence we have is that nothing works better than a healthy diet and increased physical activity , with or without weight loss drugs . "

What are these ?
What disclosures are those ?
Treason .
Sunday Times 1,2,3 . Philip Giraldi 1,2,3 .
Now BradBlog reports to us an interview from Tuesday , February 12th 2008 , in which “ outed ” CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson discusses ( at 39:00 ) the allegation that former State Department official Marc Grossman tipped off the Turks and Pakistanis to her nuclear black market - monitoring CIA front company years before we ever heard of her .
From Bradblog :
[ Plame ] says she has been following recent blockbuster series in British paper concerning U.S. nuclear secrets espionage , allegations that her [ CIA ] cover company , Brewster Jennings , was exposed by a former high - ranking State Department official as long ago as 2001 .
Former CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson says the recent disclosures in the UK ’s Sunday Times concerning the sale of U.S. nuclear secrets to the foreign black market , as aided by high - ranking government officials , are “ stunning . ”
The previously covert agent , who had worked in the agency ’s counter - proliferation division for years , monitoring traffic in the nuclear black market under the guise of a cover company named Brewster Jennings until being outed by Administration officials , was asked about the recent series of explosive stories in the British paper during an interview this morning with Florida radio host Henry Raines of American AM .
Those disclosures include allegations that Brewster Jennings was outed to Turkish officials as a CIA front , by State Department official Marc Grossman , as early as 2001 .

Last week , an intriguing proposition was mooted by Government minister Dawn Primarolo .
Teenage girls , she said , could be steered towards what is described as " long - term contraception " .
This is now possible thanks to the development of contraceptive jabs and implants which can last up to five years .
In other words , there is a way of effectively sterilising girls for a lengthy period of time .
At what age ?
Well , does n't 12 until 17 sound rather sensible ?
This would have the advantage of bringing down the teenage pregnancy rate , so high in this country it makes us a disgrace among the nations - the worst offenders in Europe .
The abortion rate would fall sharply .
And silly young girls could get on with the education that is meant to produce serious , responsible taxpayers , not benefit recipients .
Now , many people will see this modest proposal as little short of horrific - nothing less than state interference in our reproductive lives .
But think about it : it might not be such a bad idea .
We are moving into a science fiction age in which life itself can be created in a test tube , and it seems that , before long , perfect babies could be bred at will , largely free of hereditary disease and illness .
So , in my view , there is little point any more in feeling shock - horror at the idea of mass sterilisation .
Neither do I believe it will encourage " promiscuity " because girls will feel they have nothing to fear in sleeping around .
In truth , they seem to be doing that already .
I 'm afraid we are now in a time when sex is mere recreational pleasure to thousands of young women .
The trouble is that pregnancy no longer holds the fear for teenagers it once did .
The social stigma has gone .
Indeed , for many , it seems , a child has actually become a kind of perverse badge of honour .
Obviously , there are millions of sensible young girls , but for many , having a baby seems to be the logical , and even desirable , result of their teenage flings .
It it was n't , they 'd stir themselves to do something to prevent themselves getting pregnant , like taking the morning - after pill .
But they do n't .
Because the benefits of doing nothing to stop it are obvious .
Suddenly , they can give birth to someone who will offer unconditional love in a bleak , busy , money - grubbing world .
The council will offer a free home away from nagging parents .
They will have independence , sexual freedom and no more humiliating exams to try to pass - because , more than likely , their education will fall by the wayside .
Nowadays , ask some girls why they want a baby so badly and they will say vaguely : " Oh , I want to fulfil myself . "
Once , they would have confidently said of the father : " I love him .
And I want a bit of me , a bit of him , to go on for all eternity . "
It 's not like that any more .
Love is seen as little more than a neurotic dependency to the young .
The fear of pregnancy used to stop girls having sex .
To be pregnant and unmarried was a major life disaster ( as it is still in some of our ethnic communities . )
You were disgraced , soiled goods : the child was removed , no one would marry you .
I had a great aunt locked up for life in an asylum from the age of 20 until she died .
She had been declared a " moral imbecile " because she had a baby out of wedlock .
My mother tried to rescue her - but to no avail .
The rest of the family was against it .
After 30 years , she was so institutionalised , anyway , that she did n't want to leave .
This condemnation of the sexually imprudent was not meant to be unkind .
People were poor , babies without fathers suffered and there was no way women could earn money if they had a child .
It was a moral issue but the stigma was born out of necessity : a desperate attempt to stop girls from doing what came naturally until a father and a home could be provided .
But for all that , unwelcome babies went on being born - the human impulse to procreate being what it is .
How to have sex without getting pregnant was in those days a real mystery .
Now we know everything there is to know about preventing babies , yet still girls take risks .
Understanding how the body works and what happens next seem to make no difference .
Currently , our teenage pregnancy rate is twice as high as in Germany , three times as high as in France and six times as high as in the Netherlands .
Is this because , in this country , getting pregnant while still at school has become a status symbol for the girls , as ASBOs have for the boys ?
In spite of all the efforts of the Government 's Teenage Pregnancy Unit , and millions of pounds spent on initiatives to persuade girls that having babies young is a bad , bad thing , the rates stay sky - high .
In 2005 , there were 39,804 conceptions by under - 18s in England - a rate of 41.3 per thousand .
The trouble for those who would tackle the pregnancy problem is that the very act of warning against pregnancy can be unproductive .
A certain proportion of teenagers like to defy fate - and the more you warn them not to smoke , drink , have sex , stay up late , join gangs , the more they will .
Defying authority , not doing what you 're told , is , for many , part of growing up - the search for your own identity , a necessary preparation for leaving the nest .
Persuasion does n't work .
The instinct to rebel goes too deep .
Boys have always wanted to have sex and notch up " scores " on the bedpost .
The trouble now is that the girls - who once wanted just to be loved by someone , anyone - are under intense peer pressure , do n't want to be outdone or be seen to be ' square ' , and so behave like the boys .
So much for gender equality in the classroom !
It seems that many of today 's girls just like being pregnant , and emotionally and physically - not just practically - have more to gain than lose if they are .
Sex education has n't helped , and may indeed have harmed .
Freud 's view of the psychosexual development of the child has been ignored .
His opinion was that you interfere with the " latency " phase of ages nine to 12 at your peril , for fear of stopping further development .
In Freud 's theory , the latency phase is when a child unconsciously denies the facts of life until he or she is ready to face them .
If unpalatable facts are forced down the child 's throat it 's traumatising , and progression to sexual maturity is halted .
In other words , if you start teaching the birds and the bees too early , all that the nine , ten or 11 - year - olds will do is want to experiment with what they have been taught before they have the emotional capability to deal with the fallout .
The Government says it has tried everything to stop pregnancy rates rising - from school matrons to a blizzard of sex education , to free condoms and morning - after pills .
But it 's not working .
That 's why I think sterilising girls for a few years is n't such a bad idea after all - and , when you think about it , it 's a tempting solution for the State , too .
Once you stop your under - 20s having babies , there 's no end to the social improvements you could make .
If girls go on to college instead of minding babies , fewer children overall will be born .
The more educated a girl , the fewer babies she is likely to have - education and fertility rates being in inverse proportion .
The maternity services , now so very over - stretched , would be better able to cope .
Young mothers would not have the priority they now do when it comes to housing , and accommodation would be set free for those unfortunates clamouring on the waiting lists .
Education would benefit , too .
Classrooms would be less plagued by fatherless lads whose ambition it is to cause nothing but trouble .
I suppose there are other ways we could try to tackle the problem .
We could make it a lot less convenient for girls to get into trouble - and one obvious way is to overhaul the benefits system .
When it comes to receiving welfare , girls of 16 are treated as adults ( though legally they can't vote or drink ) , and their parents have no legal obligation to house or support them .
If they wo n't or can't , then the State must .
Putting that age up by a year or two might work wonders .
Then again , the recent law that allows a mother to claim benefits only until her child is six could be repealed because at present it can only encourage her to have another baby in order to keep on claiming benefits .
And who would n't ?
" Getting a job " sounds good - but what kind of local minimum wage job is the unfortunate mother likely to get anyway ?
Theory and practice are so different .
Another issue is that though many young girls " love babies " , they dislike the children they grow up to be .
Rearing a child is a lot more difficult than " having a baby " .
Watch young mothers slap their troublesome offspring in the supermarket and see what I mean .
Because you wanted a baby does not mean you wanted a child - with its separate , possibly difficult personality .
So the children of teenage mothers can suffer , too .
Not having babies takes intelligence , planning , prudence and boring appointments with doctors .
The morning - after pill helps , but still means an inquisition from your friendly ( or not - so - friendly ) neighbourhood pharmacist .
So what do we do ?
Deprive potential children of life by sterilising a few hundred thousand girls society has decided are " too young " to breed , regardless of their biological capabilities ?
Go for the quality of child they might produce in their 20s or 30s , rather than the quantity they could create if they start at 14 ?
That , let 's face it , is what 's up for discussion .
There is , I admit , a dreadful gender unfairness in the suggestion that teenage girls should be sterilised .
Should n't boys under 17 have their tubes tied , too ?
It takes two to make a baby .
What 's sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander .
Perhaps the Government should start thinking about how that would work .
I wonder what birthday cards for 18 - year - olds will look like in future ?
" I 've got the key of the door , never been able to breed before ! "
Since science has now devised a way of stopping girls getting pregnant without damaging their longterm reproductive health , the idea of enforcing sterility on girls under 17 seems to me a least worst option .

" To announce that there must be no criticism of the President , or that we are to stand by the President , right or wrong , is not only unpatriotic and servile , but is morally treasonable to the American public ...

Um ... Colin ... have you talked to your boss about this anger ?
What about guys that get those slots , and then do n't even show up for duty ?
Can you tell us which one of these guys went in GW 's place ?
" I am angry that so many of the sons of the powerful and well - placed ... managed to wangle slots in Reserve and National Guard units ...
Of the many tragedies of Vietnam , this raw class discrimination strikes me as the most damaging to the ideal that all Americans are created equal and owe equal allegiance to their country . "
( Colin Powells autobiography , My American Journey , p. 148 )
It 's now well established that George W. Bush never showed up for National Guard duty for a period of approximately one year , possibly more , in 1972 - 1973 .
Despite all the talk about " honor and dignity , " Bush seems to have a problem meeting his commitments .
" Those of us who were in the military wonder how it is that someone who is supposedly serving on active duty ... can miss a whole year of service without even explaining where it went , " said [ Senator John ] Kerry .
( Source )
Bush says he 's released all his records ... if that 's true , then has anyone seen :
Any pages from Bush 's flight log
Records from the Flight Inquiry Board convened after Bush was suspended as a pilot
Any evidence of Bush 's reclassification into another AFSC after suspension as a pilot
Any photos of George Bush in a military uniform after 1972
Anything at all from any Alabama unit with Bush 's name on it
Any copies of form 44a from the Alabama National Guard certifying attendance
Air Force Form 142 ( Aviation Service Audit Worksheet )
Anything proving service ( not just receipt of pay ) by Bush between May 1972 and May 1973 ?

AWOL ---- absent for 30 days or less .
Desertion ----- absent for more than 30 days with evidence of no intent to return to duty .

We have the pertinent records .
This is not a hunt for credible eyewitnesses and first hand statements .
The officers involved have stepped forward .
We have their testimony and we have the signed statements of those no longer living .
This is the story of how George Walker Bush walked away from a years duty while in the National Guard .
And , this is the story of how he has thus far gotten away with it .
" I continued flying with my unit for the next several years ... "
That statement is an outright LIE , which means the person making it is a LIAR .

Chasing George Bush and the F - 102 - An illustrated History of GW Bush 's Flying Career
December 30 , 2007 , 8:57 am
This Tuesday , Arizona 's death penalty goes into effect for businesses that knowingly hire workers who have not been licensed to work by the US Government .
Employers must use the e-Verify system the Federal government has in place to confirm which human beings are allowed by the federal government to work in this country and which people businesses are not allowed to employ .
Businesses that do n't face loss of their business license ( in itself a bit of government permission to perform consensual commerce I should not have to obtain ) .
There are any number of ironies in this law :
The Arizona government has resisted applying the same tight standards to receipt of government benefits , meaning the state is more comfortable with immigrants seeking government handouts than gainful employment .
The state of Arizona resists asking for any sort of ID from voters .
This means that the official position of the state of Arizona is that it is less concerned about illegal immigrants voting and receiving benefits than it is about making sure these immigrants do n't support themselves by working .
This is exactly the opposite of what a sane proposal would look like .
( and here )
In the past , we have used Arizona drivers licenses to verify citizenship .
By implementing this law , the Arizona Government has said that an Arizona driver 's license is not sufficient proof of citizenship .
Unable to maintain the integrity of their own system ( e.g. the drivers license system ) the state has effectively thrown up its hands and dumped the problem on employers
The e-verify system , which the law requires businesses use , currently disappears in 11 months .
The law requires that the e-Verify system be used for both current and new employees .
It is , however , illegal under federal law to use the e-Verify system on current employees .
In fact , the e-Verify system may only be used within 3 days of hire -- use it earlier or later , and one is violating the law .
In a particular bit of comedy , it is illegal to use the e-Verify system to vet people in the hiring process .
The government wants you to entirely complete the expensive hiring process before you find out the person is illegal to hire .
There are apparently no new penalties for hiring illegal immigrants at your house ( since there is no business license to lose ) .
State legislators did not want to personally lose access to low - cost house cleaning and landscaping help .
We 're legislators for God sakes -- we are n't supposed to pay the cost of our dumb laws !
I have criticized the AZ Republic a lot , but they have pretty comprehensive coverage on this new law here and here .
Update : Typical of the government , the e-Verify registration site is down right now .
Update # 2 : It appears Arizona is taking a page from California 's book .
California often passes regulations that it hopes businesses will follow nationally rather than go through the expense of creating different products or product packaging for California vs. the other states .
Arizona may be doing something of the same thing , since the terms of use for e-Verify require that if a business uses e-Verify , it must use if for all employees .
Therefore , a business that has any employees in Arizona is technically required to use this system for all employees nationwide .
Update # 3 : By the way , I guess I have never made my interest in this issue clear .
We do not hire any illegal immigrants .
Since most of our positions require employees to live on site in their own RV , it is seldom an issue since the average illegal immigrant does not own an RV .
We have always done all of our I - 9 homework , even though the government stopped auditing I - 9's about 8 years ago .
We have in fact been asked about five times by foreigners to hire them under the table without having the licenses and papers they need from the US government -- all of them have been Canadian .
South Africans are getting used to using candles
This would stagger peak demand across the country , the director of public enterprise told parliament .
Portia Molefe said the move could lead to an energy saving of about 200 MW but that the idea needed further study .
Last month Minerals and Energy Minister Bujelwa Sonjica said South Africans should consider going to bed early to save electricity .
Ms Molefe said having two time zones had been considered in the past but had been dropped because most of South Africa 's industry was all in the same area - Gauteng .
But she said there was now enough industry in the Western Cape to make it worth considering the option .
Middle - class suburbs are not as used to the power outages
Meanwhile , state power company Eskom has announced that it will not approve connections for major new constructions for up to six months to ease pressure on its supplies .
Eskom spokesman Andrew Etzinger said the company would honour already signed contracts but would not consider new applications .
The BBC's Peter Greste in Johannesburg says this is bad news for investors and developers hoping to go ahead with new projects .
It is also worrying for the government which was counting on sustained economic growth to ease a massive unemployment problem , he says .
The business community fears that the move will push investors to look elsewhere to spend their money .
Power cuts have wreaked havoc on businesses and industries and disrupted the country 's mining sector , raising fears of job losses .
Breaking point
But Eskom says too much development could push its over - stretched capacity to breaking point , and is asking for time to increase its capacity .
The company hopes to double its capacity by 2011 , by reviving three stalled coal stations and building two new ones .
Coal is used to generate about 90 % of electricity supplies at state power company Eskom .
New housing developments and schools will not be affected .
The company has also promised that the electricity crisis will not affect the 2010 World Cup .
The acute electricity crisis has been blamed on years of under - investment by the government and rising demand .
South Africa has already reduced electricity supplies to its neighbours , affecting countries such as Zimbabwe , Zambia , Botswana , Mozambique and Namibia .
The Freedom to Thrive
( Or My Superdelegate Solution )
There is , as always , good news for the people of the United States of America .
Despite the multiple economic , energy , environmental and foreign policy crises created or inflamed by the policies of the Bush Administration , there is good news for the American people .
The good news is that the policies of the Republican Party as led by George W. Bush , Dick Cheney and John McCain have been proven as absolute failures .
Every day more and more Americans turn away from the fear - based , small - minded policies of the past to hopeful progressive ideas for the future .
In his last State of the Union Address before World War II , Franklin Roosevelt outlined the Four Freedoms .
He stated that all people should enjoy freedom of expression , freedom of religion , freedom from want and freedom from fear .
These fundamental freedoms are at the heart of what has become the greatest nation in the world .
These freedoms are not easily won or wrestled away from the powerful who would gladly feast while the least among us suffered .
These freedoms are not easy in a time where global terrorism utilizes unprecedented tools for self - expression to plot and commit murder .
Yet these freedoms are why our sons and daughters bravely volunteer to defend this nation .
To extend these freedoms to every citizen of this country , we must be willing to sacrifice everything , even our personal ambitions .
This Democratic Primary season has been a tribute to the great freedoms we all love .
The campaigns of several fine candidates including a black man and a woman have generated more interest and empowered more Americans than any other election in our history .
It has been my honor to join with the other candidates , especially Barrack Obama , to fight what I see one of the most important battles of our time , the small - mindedness of the current Republican party .
This , the party of Lincoln , has become the party of small - mindedness .
This is a party that sees only one solution in Iraq — stay the course .
They see only one solution to our economic problems — tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans .
One solution to Global Warming and Stem - Cell Research — doing little or nothing .
The American people have resoundingly rejected these small - minded approaches to the most demanding problems of our time .
In the rampant and enthusiastic support for the candidacy of Barrack Obama and myself , we have seen an America that is willing to look past the problems of the past to the solutions of the future .
Believe me when I say that I am absolutely resolute that I am as committed as ever to the defeat of both John McCain and the small - minded policies of the past .
It is because of my dedication winning back the White House for the American people that I am asking all Democratic Party Superdelegates to vote for the candidate who has the most elected delegates before the election .
Of course , I will go on and fight for every delegate possible .
I will ask for revotes in Florida and Michigan .
But I will respect the process and support whomever the people of our party elect as our candidate .
This campaign , like any spirited competition , has brought out passions in both sides .
My husband and others have been vigorous in my defense .
Yet our respect for Barrack Obama is immense .
I would gladly support his candidacy and hope he would do the same for mine .
If he does indeed win the nomination of our party , I hope that many of the values I am fighting for , especially Universal Health Care , will become part of his agenda .
But I know that the strength and promise of any new administration will be an open - minded approach to the future that builds on the success of the 1990s and takes us new triumphs for the values of liberty , justice and respect for all humankind .
We have the right to live with our freedoms intact .
Freedom is both the means and the goal of this great American experience .
I ’m thankful for the opportunities this country has given me , and I look forward to making this country and world a better place for all of us .
Thank you and God bless .
We already knew Microsoft was at least toying around with putting Windows on the OLPC XO , but it looks like things have just gotten quite a bit more serious , with the OLPC folks now saying that they 're working " very closely " with Microsoft to develop a dual - boot Windows / Linux system for the laptop .
What 's more , Nick Neg himself reportedly said that the version of Windows that 's now up and running on the XO is " very fast " and " very , very successful . "
There 's no word just yet as to when we might actually see such a system be released , however , but OLPC is apparently now talking with Microsoft and " possibly " the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation about putting the XO to use in some of the education programs Microsoft runs in developing countries , a possibility that Negroponte says is " really cooking at the moment . "
In the January 15th issue of G&D , a research team led by Dr. Richard Behringer at MD Anderson Cancer Center reports that they have successfully switched the mouse Prx1 gene regulatory element with the Prx1 gene regulatory region from a bat – and although these two species are separated by millions of years of evolution -- the resulting transgenic mice displayed abnormally long forelimbs .
While forelimb length is just one of several key morphological changes that occurred during the evolution of the bat wing , this unprecedented finding demonstrates that evolution can be driven by changes in the patterns of gene expression , rather than solely by changes in the genes , themselves .
Prx1 is a paired - box homeodomain transcription factor , with an established role in limb bone growth .
Dr. Behringer and colleagues identified a conserved Prx1 enhancer domain , which regulates expression of Prx1 in the developing forelimb .
To study the evolutionary contribution of the Prx1 enhancer to the morphological differences between the bat and mouse forelimb , Dr. Behringer and colleagues replaced the endogenous mouse Prx1 enhancer with that of the bat .
The transgenic mice showed higher expression levels of Prx1 in the perichondrium , increased chondrocyte proliferation , and ultimately , longer forelimbs .
Dr. Behringer describes the significance of his finding as such : “ Darwin suggested that " successive slight modifications " would ultimately result in the evolution of diverse limb morphologies , like a hand , wing , or fin .
The genetic change we engineered in mice may be one of those " slight modifications " to evolve a mammalian wing . ”

Checking ' Paper Trail ' Receipts Against Touch - Screen Numbers , However , May Offer Deceptive Findings
ALSO : Random Audit Must Actually be Random This Time ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/25/2008 , 12:35 pm PT
Ohio's Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner is planning " a first - of - its - kind audit of votes from the March 4 presidential primaries , saying the outcome should help ensure the integrity of future elections , " according to a report this morning from the Columbus Dispatch .
" Brunner is calling on 11 counties to volunteer for the audit , in which at least 7 percent of the votes cast in each county would be rechecked by hand , " the paper reports .
That 's good .
But there are a couple of points that we hope she is well aware of , since such post- election audits can offer a deceptive result in a number of cases ... especially on touch - screen machines ... and especially in Ohio ...
The report from the Dispatch notes :
Brunner 's audit would cover both paper ballots read by optical scanners and electronic touch - screen voting machines .
Brunner has proposed eliminating electronic voting before the November general election .
" During her campaign , Secretary of State Brunner talked about elections that could be audited or verified , " spokesman Jeff Ortega said .
" This is a further step toward that fulfillment . "
A 2007 audit of Cuyahoga County 's November 2006 election found a number of irregularities , including the loss of some ballots and others that were counted twice .
Brunner praised that audit , which was ordered by the county board of elections , and suggested that other checks would be coming to ensure the accuracy of polling across Ohio .
That previously commissioned audit , of the Diebold touch - screens in Cuyahoga County after the '06 election , was very helpful .
Among the things found were that some 10 % of the " paper trails " on the systems were " destroyed , blank , illegible , missing , taped together or otherwise compromised . "
CNN 's Lou Dobbs Tonight ( video and transcript here ) reported that the audit revealed on many of the touch - screens , " the machine 's four sources of vote totals , individual ballots , paper trail summary , election archives , and the memory cards , did not all match up .
The totals were all different . "
The study helped lead , in part , to scrapping the touch - screen systems all together in Cuyahoga , Ohio 's largest voting jurisdiction --- its largest city , Cleveland , was the site of enormous election problems in 2004 --- and the move to optical - scan paper ballots to be tallied at the county election headquarters .
But auditing " paper trails " from touch - screen systems can also be deceptive , and result in a false sense of security .
A number of studies , including a landmark report from the NYU Brennan Center for Justice , revealed how such a system can be hacked to effect an election outcome , even while ensuring that the so - called " voter verifiable paper audit trails " ( VVPAT ) would still match up with the internal machine numbers in such a way that an audit would not likely discover the hack .
Worse , such an audit --- of a hacked DRE / touch - screen election --- could actually result in a report claiming the election was " 100 % accurate , " even though it had been gamed .
The take - away here : Audits of " paper trails " may be helpful in finding problems with touch - screen voting systems .
Audits of such systems which do n't find any problems when comparing " paper trail " results with machine results , may be exceedingly deceptive , and should n't be taken as a sign that the touch - screens worked correctly .
There is simply no way to use touch - screen voting machines safely --- with or without a " paper trail " --- in any American election .
One other caveat concerning Brunner 's proposed audits .
As the Dispatch reports , " Local elections boards will randomly select precincts that account for at least 7 percent of the votes cast , and bipartisan monitoring teams will count ballots from the presidential primaries by hand . "
The trick here is assuring randomness .
After the 2004 Presidential Election in Ohio --- in Cuyahoga County , in fact --- Election Officials pre-counted the paper ballots in order to assure that their mandated 3 % of precincts counted in the Green / Libertarian Party recounts would match the official reported results .
The " random " selection of ballots was little more than a show , as the election workers rigged the recount .
Two of them , were eventually sentenced to 18 months in jail for their felony crime .
The verdict was thrown out on a technicality , and before a retrial could occur , the two women convicted pleaded " no contest " and were given no time in jail .
The take - away here : Make sure " random " really means random !
[ UPDATE : EmLev points out in comments that there may indeed be a problem with Brunner 's definition of " random " ]
Good luck , Ohio !

Writes Joshua Reid :
“ With the travesty that we all just witnessed in the Republican primaries I was curious to why I had not seen a lot of people exclaiming for a Ron Paul Write - In on the ballot in November .
I have talked to supporters out here in DC , and many of them are already planning to do so as well as myself . ”
UPDATE from Fred Church : “ The travesty of the Republican primaries is nothing compared to the wanton disregard many states have for write - in votes .
Anyone that intends to write - in Ron Paul must very carefully check the applicable laws that determine what write - ins get counted and for whom .
In my home state of California , write - ins are only counted for declared write - in candidates , and Dr. Paul would have to acquiesce to that kind of candidacy and form a slate of electors before a single vote for him is counted in in the Golden State .
I do n’t think any Revolutionary wants to see his vote within the ‘ Scattered ’ percentage the day after election day . ”

I talked a little while ago about working outside the box with Unity .
At that time I gave a sneak peak into what I ’ve been working here at VMware the past few months .
Well , now everyone can see .
We just announced VMware Workstation 6.5 beta 1 , the first public beta for Workstation 6.5 .
Among many other awesome features is Unity , a feature we introduced in our Fusion product ( for MacOS X ) which allows you to run your applications from your virtual machine on your desktop without needing to be confined to a big box representing the VM ’s monitor .
Unity is available in both our Linux and Windows releases of Workstation 6.5 beta 1 , and there ’s currently support for Windows guests ( Windows 2000 and up ) .
However , it ’s a beta so you can expect some problems .
To help people get started , here ’s a rundown on what you can expect from Unity in beta 1 .
Features Overview :
Shaped windows
Guest mouse cursors
Proper window types for most windows ( Menu , Dialog , Tooltip , etc . )
Special effects with Compiz
Virtual desktops
Copy and paste between host and guest
Start menu integration
Window borders and badges
Seamless window integration
With the press of a button , the applications in your virtual machine will pop out and appear on your desktop , intermixed with all your native applications .
These windows can stack in any order along with your native windows and will maximize , minimize , and close as you ’d expect any normal window to .
They ’ll appear just like they would in the guest , aside from any borders or badges you have set to help identify the guest windows ( more on that in a minute ) .
We do our best to set the window types on these windows to best reflect their type in the guest .
This means that a tooltip from the guest will look and act like a tooltip in the host , as will a dialog , menu , etc .
This is important for supporting the special effects provided by a window manager .
Special effects
If your window manager has any special effects set for the windows , they ’ll apply to guest windows .
For example , users of Compiz will be glad to know that their wobbly windows will work for such applications as Office 2008 or Minesweeper , and your guest menus will still burst into flames when they appear .
There are a few cases where the effect is n’t as strong as with native windows .
Due to the way we receive window updates and events , the display of a window will often update before we receive open , close or minimize events .
We plan to make this work better for some event types in the next beta , but for now , I recommend choosing special effects that modify a window in - place ( fire , fade - in , etc. ) instead of one that zooms a window to a location for opening / closing windows .
Virtual desktops
Windows may not natively have virtual desktop support , but Linux does , so we felt it was important to make virtual desktops with Unity just work .
You can place your guest applications across your virtual desktops .
Maximize Office on one desktop , play a game of Solitaire on another , and reserve a third for your Internet Explorer debugging session .
Copy and paste
Copy and paste is an important part of any user ’s daily work .
We currently have support for copying and pasting text between host and guest .
You ca n’t yet copy and paste images or other data , though .
Start menu integration
A desktop environment is n’t useful without the ability to get to your programs .
We provide a little tool called Unity Helper that runs automatically and provides start menu integration .
Simply move your mouse to the top - left corner of your primary monitor and the menu will pop down , providing a start button for each of your VMs in Unity .
Click the button and your start menu ’s contents will appear .
The start button will match the color of the Unity badges and borders that are set to help you quickly identify your VM .
This functionality is pretty new so there are some kinks to work out .
For example , if you do n’t have a top panel or your top panel is larger than 24 pixels , you might notice the window in a wrong location .
This is a bug that will be fixed in beta 2 .
We ’re also hoping to add more options for the location of this window .
Another useful tip is that you can use Unity Helper to launch applications in a guest via the panel or command line .
Simply run :
$ vmware - unity - helper -- run / path/to/vm.vmx c:\path\to\program.exe arguments
This only works if your VM is currently powered on and in Unity or if the VM is not open anywhere .
It ’s not a supported feature at this point .
Borders and badges
In order to help identify a window belonging to a particular VM , we have color - coded badges and borders on the Unity windows .
The border goes around the window and fades from corner to corner , and the badge is a little VMware logo sitting on your titlebar .
Both are purely decorative and optional .
You can turn them on or off in VM Settings or change the color .
The color will also match the start button .
Known bugs ( and workarounds )
As with any beta , there are of course bugs that you may hit .
Pay special attention to the first item on the list .
Start menu problems after a crash .
If there ’s a crash , sometimes the start menu integration wo n’t work the next session .
The trick is to exit Workstation ( leave the VM running in the background ) , delete /tmp/ vmware - $USER/unity - helper-ipc-* , and bring Workstation back up .
, and bring Workstation back up .
Occasionally Unity may crash .
This is a known bug when a guest window changes its type when we do n’t expect it .
If you hit this , do n’t worry !
Your VM is still running in the background .
Just re-launch Workstation or Player and go back into Unity mode .
Graphics glitches .
Sometimes you ’ll notice the background appearing when you close or minimize a window .
We hope to fix this up for the next beta .
Multiple monitors are not supported in beta 1 .
Drag and drop is not supported in beta 1 .
Due to a recent regression just before beta 1 , there are graphical glitches for applications not on the current desktop .
Some applications behave badly .
Photoshop and Flash ( the creation program , not the plugin ) ( ab) use windows all over the place , and so you ’ll see windows where you would n’t expect them .
Sometimes they do n’t even get proper updates , making the UI unusable .
We ’re looking into solutions for this .
There ’s more , but those are the main ones I can think of that people may hit .
Give it a try and feel free to report bugs in the user forums .
This is not a traditional sales page .
No hype , no secrets , no magic formula .
This page is to show you WHY $ 19 will be the best investment you can make with your look – to show you the difference between a diet that makes you lose some pounds and a diet that makes you steadily losing weight .
Want Everybody to Admire How You Change Your Body To Sexier , Thinner and Killer Looking ?
Of course you do .
There are thousands of good looking people around you and you need to outperform them .
You need to exercise but the first thing you need is a trustworthy diet that makes you lose pounds day after day – steadily and healthy .
A Trustworthy Diet Will :
1 . Make you look sexier and leaner .
2. Increase your chances for dates .
3 . Help you to be promoted for a higher position .
No doubt you have heard this many times “ people judge other people by their look ” .
Even though you are very clever and nice person , people still prefer to meet and communicate to better looking people .
Think about the last time you met a stranger .
What was the first thing you noticed ?
The soul or the look ?
Thinking to Follow Unknown Online Diet ?
Sure , you can read tones of info about diets .
There are 3 drawbacks to doing this :
1 . All websites tell you what to do without giving you info why .
2 . Most of the diets have exotic and difficult to provide ingredients .
3 . And the most important element of all ca n’t be supplied – the willing to really help you .
Lisa , from Chicago
“ Thank you , Rumi , your diet book changed my life , literally !
I did intense research before I choose your diets and I am really glad I did .
After a couple of days following your diets I saw that my face skin looked smoother and after a week my weight scales showed 5 pounds less !
I am really pleased with the results .
My colleagues look at me such they see a new person and you know , MEN turn after me !
Thank you , thank you , thank you , for giving me the chance to feel and look this way ! ”
Do n’t Do Diet Harder When It Can Be Easier
A well developed diet does n’t change your daily routine .
It gives you energy the whole day and you do n’t feel hunger at any moment .
Even more , you MUST eat several times per day in order to lose weight .
The diet does n’t require long shopping time and stay in the kitchen .
It is a breeze to prepare your daily menu and to follow it with willingness .
Peter , London
“ After I felt to follow many diets I started Google search for a trustworthy diet .
It brought lots of options .
I cut away $ 50 offers worried about being ripped off !
Than I found Rumi ’s site .
Though not the best looking , it had an air of sincerity .
True to that , Rumi delivered the diet immediately and I impatiently downloaded it to my computer .
The diet is very easy to follow , only simple foods and nothing complicated .
You eat 4 - 5 times per day , you stay full but you lose pounds !
My wife ca n’t believe the progress I have .
I feel myself full of energy , more positive and my male endurance increase , you know what I mean ; ) . ”
So What ’s The Difference Between a Diet that Works Well And a Diet that Works Exceptionally Well ?
The foods included in the diet are not randomly chosen .
The foods vary every day in order to give you all need it ingredients and to keep you in good health .
Every food is chosen in relation to other foods for the day .
So , your body receives necessary protein , carbs , fat , vitamins and minerals !
The result is that you speed up your metabolism and steadily lose fat !
Short explanation follows every food , so you know why eat this .
The reason why food explanation is included in the book is because you need to understand healthy eating principles and continue applying them even when you reached your desired weight .
Here ’s a hypothetical example of a “ working ” diet .
You eat some food , not too much , you feel hunger and you lose weight .
But what weight ?
It is very important to lose weight from fat , not weight from muscles .
Why ?
Because fat makes you look jelly and muscles make you look toned .
Back to the example ; you follow a diet , you lose weight and you think this is working diet .
But it is not !
Working diet means that you lose only fat and you keep your muscles
Foods included in the diet book nourish only your muscles and this helps your body to burn the fat .
The result is that you melt your jelly areas and you underline your muscles .
Why Most Diets Work Only During The First Week ?
Your body is very adaptive system which main role is to survive in any conditions .
What happens after you start a diet ?
Your body experiences energy deficiency and this causes losing weight .
At the mean time your body adapts to this situation and the body starts spending less energy .
If you want to continue losing weight you do n’t have to give your body a chance to adapt .
This means that you need to start a new diet before the body adapts .
My job is to give you all this information and to make you familiar why the book contains 3 diets .
Each diet is one week long and following them religiously you lose minimum 3 pounds per week .
After 21 days your body weights minimum 9 pound less .
Sheri , London
“ I am so pleased I bought this book .
I desperately needed a change in my body , because I did n’t date last year .
I was so shy and worried about my extra weight and was unable to communicate with men .
Now I am 40 pounds lighter , self confident and happy wit my new boyfriend .
I do n’t know how to express my gratitude to Rumi , her diets improve my whole life ! ”

( AP ) HAMBURG , Germany -
The oldest bordello in Hamburg ’s red - light district is shutting down for lack of business , according to newspaper reports published Friday .
The family - run Hotel Luxor , established in 1948 , is being sold to an investor and will close down for good next month , madam Waltraud Mehrer said , according to the Hamburg Morgenpost and Bild newspapers .
She blamed the decline in business on easily available Internet porn , the rise of call - girl services , and " noisy discos and dance clubs " on the same street as her business , the newspapers reported .
" You ca n’t make any big money selling sex in St. Pauli any more , " she was quoted as saying , referring to the area that includes the red - light district .
" The only thing still in operation are the table dance clubs . "
The club ’s heyday was in the 1970s , when it was open 7 days a week , with 12 prostitutes on hand .
" Our customers were well off , they did n’t scrimp , " she said .
" That ’s also changed today . "
Hotel Luxor today employs four prostitutes , and is only open Tuesday through Friday nights .
" Two thousand euros ( US $ 3,080 ) per night _ it was like that once , " one of the women , who gave her name only as " Nicole , " told the Morgenpost .
" Now I can only dream of that .
I ’ve been here a year and only earn around euro200 ( US$ 308 ) per shift . "

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
His mother suffered dark depressions and tried to dominate his life .
His sister and daughter had severe mental problems , his father and wife died young and a beloved uncle committed suicide in his arms .
Peter Mark Roget is shown in this 1867 photograph from the Wellcome Library in London .
A new book " The Man Who Made Lists " by author Joshua Kendall , details the life and work of Roget who devised and published " Roget 's Thesaurus " in 1852 .
Kendall 's book tells of how the 19th century British scientist made lists of words and created synonyms for all occasions that ultimately helped make life easier for term paper writers and crossword puzzle lovers .
According to the new biography , making his lists saved Roget 's life and by keeping him from succumbing to the depression and misery of those around him .

So what did Peter Mark Roget , the creator of Roget ’s Thesaurus , do to handle all the pain , grief , sorrow , affliction , woe , bitterness , unhappiness and misery in a life that lasted over 90 years ?
He made lists .
The 19th century British scientist made lists of words , creating synonyms for all occasions that ultimately helped make life easier for term paper writers , crossword puzzle lovers and anyone looking for the answer to the age - old question : “ What ’s another word for ... ”
And according to a new biography , making his lists saved Roget ’s life and by keeping him from succumbing to the depression and misery of those around him .
“ As a boy he stumbled upon a remarkable discovery -- that compiling lists of words could provide solace , no matter what misfortunes may befall him , ” says Joshua Kendall author of the just published “ The Man Who Made Lists ” ( Putnam , $ 25.95 ) , a study of Roget ’s life ( 1779 to 1869 ) based on diaries , letters and even an autobiography composed of lists .
Kendall , in a recent interview , said Roget cared more for words than people and that making lists on the scale that he did was obsessive - compulsive behavior that helped him fend off the demons that terrorized his distinguished British family .
Madness was a regular guest in Roget ’s home , Kendall said .
One of his grandmothers either had schizophrenia or severe depression , Roget ’s mother lapsed into paranoia , often accusing the servants of plotting against her .
Both his sister and his daughter suffered depression and mental problems .
Then there was the case of Roget ’s uncle , British member of Parliament Sir Samuel Romilly , known for his opposition to the slave trade and for his support of civil liberties .
He slit his own throat while Roget tried to get the razor out of his hands .

Unlike a Thesaurus , no one understood Uncle Sam ’s last words : “ My dear .... I wish ... ”
Indeed , to quote most of the Thesaurus listing for pain , Roget ’s was a life filled with grief , pain , suffering , distress , affliction , woe , bitterness , heartache , unhappiness , infelicity and misery .
NOT WHOLLY EVIL
Kendall said , “ The lists gave him an alternative world to which to repair . ”
Many writers have declared their debt to Roget , including Peter Pan ’s creator , J.M. Barrie .
In homage , he put a copy of the Thesaurus in Captain Hook ’s cabin so he could declare : “ The man is not wholly evil -- he has a Thesaurus in his cabin .
The 20th century poet Sylvia Plath called herself “ Roget ’s Strumpet ” to pay respects for all the word choices he gave her .
But the British journalist Simon Winchester holds Roget responsible for helping to dumb down Western culture because his work allows a writer to look it up rather than think it out .
Roget made his first attempt at a Thesaurus at age 26 but put aside the effort and did not publish his book until 1852 when he was in his 70s and retired .
He then kept busy with it for the rest of his life .
It became an instant hit in Britain but did not sell that well when an American edition was published two years later .
But when Americans went crazy for crossword puzzles in the 1920s , the Thesaurus assumed its place on reference shelves .
Kendall ’s book is written in a style that he calls “ narrative non-fiction ” which contains a lot of dialogue and descriptions of how Roget and his friends feel and think , all , he says , based on source material .
“ I did a lot of work to stitch together a narrative , ” he said , adding that all the scenes in the book are based on actual events .
America 's massive military aid package to Pakistan is being scrutinised after allegations that as much as 70 % of $ 5.4bn in assistance to the country has been misspent .
Since 2002 the US has paid the operating costs of Pakistan 's military operations in the tribal belt along the Afghan border , where Taliban and al - Qaida fighters are known to shelter .
Pakistan provides more than 100,000 troops and directs the battles ; the US foots the bill for food , fuel , ammunition and maintenance .
The cash payments - averaging $ 80 m ( £ 40 m ) a month - have been a cornerstone of US support for Pakistan 's president , Pervez Musharraf .
But over the past 18 months , as militants have seized vast areas of the tribal belt and repelled a string of Pakistani offensives , the funding has come under the microscope .
American officials processing the payments at the US embassy in Islamabad have concluded that the Pakistani expense claims have been vastly inflated , two western military officials have told the Guardian .
" My back of envelope guesstimate is that 30 % of the money they requested to be reimbursed was legitimate costs they had expended , " said one , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The official said that the US did not know what had happened to the remaining 70 % of the funds - amounting to approximately $ 3.8 bn - but suspected that some of the money might have been spent on F - 16 fighter jets or " a new house for an army general " .
Other than those possibilities , he said , at least half the money was thought to have disappeared .
" Who knows , the roads on Constitution Avenue [ in Islamabad ] may have been paved with part of this money , " he added .
The Pakistani military denied the claims .
" As far as the military is concerned , I can assure you we have full account of these things , " said its spokesman , Major General Athar Abbas .
He admitted that there had been some American complaints but denied serious irregularities .
" Yes there are minor issues they keep raising , but at no stage have we received any formal complaint from any official channel . "
The controversy highlights not only strains in the relationship between Washington and Islamabad but also the limits of George Bush 's " war on terror " .
Pakistani officials say they have lost more than 1,000 soldiers in the tribal areas since 2002 - twice as many as the US has lost in Afghanistan - and caught or killed more than 1,000 " terrorists " .
US officials , who have propped up Musharraf as militants have rampaged across the tribal belt and beyond , feel they have received bad value for money .
Pakistani civilians are angry with both sides .
Anti-American sentiment has hit a new high , while anger towards Musharraf contributed to the thrashing his party received in last week 's election .
The scale of US military assistance was shrouded in secrecy for years .
When it became public , so did its extraordinarily lax accounting procedures .
Every month the Pakistani military submits expense claims averaging $ 80 m to the US embassy in Islamabad .
No receipts are provided to support the claims , and the money is paid directly into the finance ministry .
Poorly accounted - for claims for payment caused the US to suspend payouts several months last spring , a second western official said .
The Washington Post reported last week that a claim for " roads and tracks " from the Pakistani navy had been rejected .
Abbas claimed that the navy was " also involved in the war on terror " in having to " guard against infiltration of arms and explosive from abroad " .
The scale of the problem has led US officials to share their worries with other allies in Pakistan .
American politicians have used the payments to exert pressure on Musharraf .
On the eve of last week 's vote , Democrat senator Joe Biden , head of the Senate foreign relations committee , warned that funding could be slashed if there was widespread rigging .
But analysts and officials say the US is unlikely to turn off the cash tap any time soon given Pakistan 's importance in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and other foreign fugitives .
One of the great things about being ignorant is that I often think my ideas are original .
It ’s a wonderful feeling .
That ’s why I try to avoid any knowledge that would spoil the sensation .
Sometimes it is n’t easy .
People keep hurling knowledge at me , and I ca n’t always duck .
For example , people often accuse me of ripping off the great philosopher Spinoza when I write about the universe being God , or when I say people obviously have no free will .
I act like I know what they are talking about and quickly change the subject .
In reality , I did n’t know Spinoza from Shinola .
Einstein has famously said he believes in Spinoza ’s version of God .
I always wondered why he invoked Spinoza .
It was time to find out about this Spinoza dude .
I ’m far too lazy to read an entire book , so I went to Wikipedia and read what strangers with no credibility had to say about him .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza
Holy cow !
My opinions match Spinoza ’s perfectly .
It turns out that being ignorant is almost exactly like being a well - read student of philosophy who can quote from the work of the masters .
How lucky is that ?
Now I know why Einstein invoked Spinoza when talking about his beliefs .
Einstein discovered more than the theory of relativity .
He also found a way to act like he believed in God , so all the God- lovers would accept him as their own , while simultaneously saying God is nothing more than semantics , so atheists would embrace him too .
And he blamed it all on a dead guy , Spinoza .
How many ways does Einstein need to keep proving he ’s a genius ?
I mean seriously , this is just showing off .
I have decided to adopt Einstein ’s weasel - genius view of God so everyone thinks I ’m on their side .
That could come in handy when I run for President .
For the record , I believe in Spinoza ’s God .
Less than one percent of Americans will know what that means .
The other 99 % will think I believe God is a bearded guy who hands out harps in the afterlife .
They will love me for being on their side .
I think Spinoza would be proud to know that his life ’s work boiled down to creating a God for weasels .
Dr Aifantis : developing new theories in the nanoworld
She passed her degree at 19 , and was awarded a PhD in natural sciences and mathematics at the age of 21 .
Her studies took her from Michigan Tech in the US , to Cambridge University , UK , and then to the University of Groningen in the Netherlands .
Dr Aifantis is one of the first recipients of a new funding programme for " exceptional " researchers who chose to work in Europe .
Now 24 , she is the youngest recipient of one of the first European Research Council ( ERC ) starting grants .
She will use the grant to spearhead a research programme studying mechanisms that exist at very small scales in the " tiny world " of nanotechnology .
The aim of the work is to develop new applications of nanotechnology in the field of biomedicine , such as miniature batteries for brain implants designed to treat diseases such as Parkinson's .
I met this beautiful community in science and I really wanted to be a part of it
Katerina Aifantis
Such devices would apply a current to dead nerves , and help activate parts of the brain that have been damaged , she says .
" I have to apply a new theoretical framework in order to capture what goes on in the nanoscale , " she says .
She credits her precocity with growing up in a scientific environment - her father is a scientist working in the field of mechanics , who was surrounded by Nobel Prize winners .
" I met this beautiful community in science and I really wanted to be a part of it , " she explains .
" I also wanted to see exactly what he was doing so that motivated me to go fast in my studies . "
At 16 , she was given the opportunity to enrol at Michigan Tech by her High School principal .
She passed her degree in engineering at 19 , then went to Cambridge University in the UK for her PhD .
She was supervised by the applied mathematician , Professor John Willis .
" He let me go straight ahead into research instead of making me take courses and following the traditional path , " she says .
Although she finished her dissertation within a year , she was unable to submit for a PhD at Cambridge because rules stipulate a minimum of three years of study .
" John Willis and I thought that I could transfer to a different university in Europe that has no time requirements , " she explains .
She moved to the University of Groningen , which was doing similar experiments , and became the Netherland 's youngest PhD ever , aged just 21 .
" I guess I was very blessed in having wonderful people to support me , and also both my father and my mother were very supportive of my love for science , " she says .
Her advice to other young scientists is to surround themselves by supportive mentors who will help them do something new in the field .
" Motivation is the main thing , " she adds .
She says the ERC starting grant helps ambitious young scientists who want to focus on their research .
" Because I went very fast , and I got my PhD when I was 21 , I was looking for something challenging to do , " she says .
" It 's just something amazing for us young people wanting to start out dynamically , " she adds .
CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela will immediately restore diplomacy with Colombia but ties are still fragile , the government said on Sunday , after this week ’s resolution of a regional dispute that had raised fears of war .
Colombia 's President Alvaro Uribe ( L ) and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ( R ) talk as Dominican President Leonle Fernandez looks on after they agreed to resolve the crisis set off by an attack on a FARC guerrilla camp inside Ecuadorian territory by the Colombian armed forces last week at the 20th Group of Rio Summit in Santo Domingo March 7 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Official Summit Photographer / Handout
A Colombian raid on a Marxist guerrilla camp in Ecuador last week sparked the region ’s worst diplomatic crisis in years , with Venezuela and Ecuador sending troops to their borders with Colombia , their U.S. - backed neighbor .
Leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez cut ties with Colombia but , following a handshake at a regional summit on Friday , promised to quickly withdraw the 10 army battalions he had sent to the border and normalize relations .
Colombia ’s March 1 raid on a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , rebel camp killed over 20 fighters including the rebel ’s second in command , Raul Reyes .
The attack came just days after the FARC released four lawmakers they had held hostage for years in a deal negotiated by Chavez , who has good relations with the guerrillas .
The foreign ministry said on Sunday that Venezuela would send diplomats , including a soon - to - be - named new ambassador , back to Bogota immediately and was ready to receive Colombian diplomats “ as soon as possible . ”
Despite all sides de-escalating the conflict in recent days , relations are still delicate between Colombia ’s pro-Washington government and left - wing nationalists in Venezuela , Ecuador and Bolivia .
Venezuela ’s Foreign Minister , Nicolas Maduro , said the countries will need to move with caution to avoid new fractures between the ideologically opposed nations .
TIES STILL FRAGILE
“ We have to be very watchful and careful so the recuperation in political relations overcomes the current fragility , ” Maduro said in an interview with Reuters .
Ecuador has been reluctant to quickly patch things up with Colombia , demanding a commitment that the Colombians never again launch a raid across the borders .
“ We ’re the victims .
Uribe must guarantee that neighbors do n’t find themselves involved in this , ” Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said in an interview published in an Argentine newspaper on Sunday .
Venezuela , which is an outspoken critic of the government of U.S. President George W. Bush , accused Washington of trying stir up violence in the region .
“ The U.S. government was close to achieving its goal that our countries entered belligerent conflict , ” Maduro said , warning that any attack on Venezuela would be met with violence .
“ We are a people of peace but also a warrior people , ” he said .
“ Nobody should interfere with us . ”
The United States spends billions of dollars on military aid to help Colombia in its fight against rebels and drug cartels .
Venezuela has been re-arming its military in recent years , buying fighter jets from Russia after Washington refused to repair its aging U.S. - built war planes .
The head of the Organization of American States , Jose Miguel Insulza , was in Quito on Sunday and said he wanted to clear up exactly what had happened in the raid .
He said he would propose mechanisms to lower regional tensions .
Nicaragua , which briefly cut relations with Bogota in support of Ecuador and has its own border disputes with Colombia , has also agreed to restore its diplomats .
Australian model Kristy
Hinze says she was instantly attracted to her 63 - year - old boyfriend , Texan billionaire Jim Clark , by his intelligence .
The 27 - year - old granddaughter of the late Queensland politician Russ Hinze has been dating Clark , the founder of Netscape , for two - and - a - half years .
The pair were tight - lipped about their relationship until now , but Hinze has told The Australian Women 's Weekly she was instantly attracted to the thrice - married entrepreneur .
Most of the time we pretend it ’s not there :
The staggering financial cost of the war in Iraq , which continues to soar , unchecked , like a rocket headed toward the moon and beyond .
Early last year , the Nobel - Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz estimated that the “ true ” cost of the war would ultimately exceed $ 1 trillion , and maybe even $ 2 trillion .
Incredibly , that estimate may have been low .
A report prepared for the Democratic majority on the Joint Economic Committee of the House and Senate warns that without a significant change of course in Iraq , the long - term cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could head into the vicinity of $ 3.5 trillion .
The vast majority of those expenses would be for Iraq .
Priorities do n’t get much more twisted .
A country that ca n’t find the money to provide health coverage for its children , or to rebuild the city of New Orleans , or to create a first - class public school system , is flushing whole generations worth of cash into the bottomless pit of a failed and endless war .
Can the U.S. Brace Its Fall ?
Analysis by Jim Lobe
WASHINGTON , Feb 17 ( IPS ) – “ Is the American era over ? ” That was the big question that launched a lengthy analysis by veteran international affairs reporter James Kitfield in the influential ‘ National Journal ’ last May .
Significantly , the article — which featured interviews with an all - star cast of former top U.S. policy - makers — was titled “ The Decline Begins . ”
[…]
What a difference five years and an invasion and bungled occupation of Iraq make !
References to the Roman Empire at this point are more likely to refer to its decline than to its power — an observation confirmed even by Donald Kagan , a dean of neo-conservatism and Kennedy ’s colleague at Yale , whose sons , Robert and Frederick , have been champions of the Bush Doctrine and the Iraq War .
“ I ’ve argued that not since the Roman Empire has anyone had such extraordinary power as the United States after the Cold War , ” Kagan told Kitfield .
“ But all of the elements of our strength are now being challenged , and it ’s perfectly possible that we are seeing a relative decline in U.S. power that will prove lasting . ”

But the RSPCA has called on the device to be banned because it is too small to provide fish with adequate oxygen supplies and a clean environment .
The iPond is sold nationally by the Pets Paradise and Pet Goods Direct chains .
Users can play their iPods through a speaker built into the bottom of the brick - shaped tank .
The tank 's water capacity is about 650 millilitres once rocks are placed in it .
Pets Paradise is selling Siamese fighting fish with the iPond .
The fighting fish are native to South - East Asia and have a " labyrinth lung " that allows them to take in oxygen from air .
Typically they live in puddles and rice paddies .
A Melbourne Aquarium spokesman said Siamese fighting fish required a minimum tank size of 10 litres - dramatically more than the iPond provides .
Animal Liberation Victoria 's Noah Mark said he was disgusted by the invention .
Studies proved fish had memories well beyond a few seconds and were social creatures that experienced pain and boredom , he said .
" The fish in this thing does not look like it has very long to live and it can barely move , " he said .
" Even if it does live it 's not [ a ] life worth living ... it 's really just a torture box . "
Acoustics expert Jason Gedamke said there was no doubt noise from the speaker would escape into the water .
" The speaker is directly coupled to the outside of the tank ... [ so ] you are going to have a small level of sound introduced , " Mr Gedamke said .
" It 's the same as putting a fish tank on a speaker . "
RSPCA spokesman Hugh Wirth said despite the fighting fish 's ability to breathe air from the surface , the tank was far too small for it to receive adequate oxygen .
The small volume of water would lead to rapid temperature change and this meant the tropical fish would not live long , he said .
The iPond should be banned , Dr Wirth said .
Marketing manager for the Pets Paradise and Pet Goods Direct chains , Alyse - Grace Robertson , said the tanks had gone on sale in September and were selling briskly .
The group that manages the stores had received one formal complaint about the product .
Customers sometimes asked questions about the welfare of fish in iPonds .
" A few people ask , ' is the fish OK ? " '
Ms Robertson said .
The chains were satisfied that fish in iPonds did not suffer .
She said before selling the tanks the chains had consulted the Pet Industry Association of Australia .
Output from the speakers was small and fish in iPonds seemed to flourish , she said .
A spokesperson for Apple said the company was willing to comment on its own products , but not on accessories made by third parties .
I recently received an email from Andrew Stuart of the Australian firm Flat Rate Recruitment .
Andrew related their technical phone screen process , which is apparently quite similar to the one outlined in Getting the Interview Phone Screen Right .
I 'm glad to hear it works .
A proper phone screen is critical .
I completely agree with Andrew : you should be 95 % certain that a candidate would be a great hire before they ever set foot in an interview room .
Anything less is a colossal waste of everyone 's time .
But there 's one aspect of the recruiting process that often goes awry , even with a great phone screen in place .
Andrew presented an excellent anecdote in his email that explains it better than I can :
I had a client building an advanced security application .
I sent them person after person and they kept knocking them back .
The reason was almost always because the person " did n't have enough low level coding experience . "
The people I sent had done things like design and develop operating systems , advanced memory managers and other highly sophisticated applications .
But my client was n't interested .
They required previous hands on low level coding experience in a particular discipline .
Eventually I got an application from a very bright software engineer who almost single - handedly wrote a classic computer emulator , but had little or no low level coding experience in the particular discipline they required .
I told the client , " I have a great guy here who has no experience doing low level coding and I think you should hire him . "
They were extremely skeptical .
I pushed hard to get an interview .
" Look , this guy is a superb software engineer who does n't have low level coding experience in the particular discipline you require now , but if you employ him , within 3 - 6 months you will have a superb software engineer who does have the low level coding experience you 're looking for . "
They interviewed him and gave him the job .
Within a matter of weeks it was clear he was the smartest programmer in the company .
He quickly mastered their low level coding and his learning went well beyond that of the other coders in the company .
Every time I talk to that client he raves on about this employee , who is now the technical backbone of the company .
That company no longer focuses its recruitment on candidates that exactly match previous experience with the required technologies .
Instead they focus on finding and employing the smartest and most passionate engineers .
This toxic , counterproductive years of experience myth has permeated the software industry for as long as I can remember .
Imagine how many brilliant software engineers companies are missing out on because they are completely obsessed with finding people who match -- exactly and to the letter -- some highly specific laundry list of skills .
Somehow , they 've forgetten that what software developers do best is learn .
Employers should be looking for passionate , driven , flexible self - educators who have a proven ability to code in whatever language -- and serving them up interesting projects they can engage with .
It 's been shown time and time again that there is no correlation between years of experience and skill in programming .
After about six to twelve months working in any particular technology stack , you either get it or you do n't .
No matter how many years of " experience " another programmer has under their belt , there 's about even odds that they have no idea what they 're doing .
This is why working programmers quickly learn to view their peers with a degree of world - weary skepticism .
Perhaps it 's the only rational response when the disconnect between experience and skill is so pervasive in the field of software engineering .
With that in mind , do you really want to work for a company that still doggedly pursues the years of experience myth in their hiring practices ?
Unlikely .
Which leads me to my point : Requiring X years of experience on platform Y in your job posting is , well , ignorant .
As long as applicants have 6 months to a year of experience , consider it a moot point for comparison .
Focus on other things instead that 'll make much more of a difference .
Platform experience is merely a baseline , not a differentiator of real importance .
In turn that means you as an applicant can use requirements like " 3 - 5 years doing this technology " as a gauge of how clued - in the company hiring is .
The higher their requirements for years of service in a given technology , the more likely that they 're looking for all the wrong things in their applicants , and thus likely that the rest of the team will be stooges picked for the wrong reasons .
I 'm not saying experience does n't matter in software development .
It does .
But consider the entire range of a developer 's experience , and realize that time invested does not automatically equal skill .
Otherwise , you may be rejecting superb software engineers simply because they lack " ( n ) years of experience " in your narrow little technological niche -- and that 's a damn shame .

Opinion : The Roads Have Eyes
An editorial by Richard Diamond detailing problems of fairness and accuracy that come with reliance upon photo enforcement .
Your days of being pulled over for speeding are numbered .
That would be great news , except in an increasing number of states the flashing red and blue lights in your rear - view mirror are being replaced by the photographic flash of traffic cameras -- we 'll call them automated ticketing machines , or ATMs .
Sadly , these particular contraptions are the opposite of the familiar money - dispensing machines found outside our local banks .
Instead , these devices take our money , and dispense it in massive bundles to voracious local governments .
The cameras come in two formats : red light cameras and speed cameras .
Both types capture still photos or video clips of cars in motion -- cars that have somehow triggered , either rightly or wrongly , a virtual trip wire that says , in effect , " We just caught you breaking the law . "
The companies that operate the cameras on behalf of various jurisdictions later mail out the photos they 've captured to the cars ' registered owners , along with hefty fines for violating a state law or municipal ordinance .
Speed cameras use radar , laser , or pavement - mounted sensors to create an estimate of speed .
Red light cameras use a similar array of sensors to determine whether a car entered an intersection as little as a tenth of a second after the light has turned red .
If traffic cameras have n't yet come to your town , do n't get too comfortable , because local governments are becoming increasingly interested in recruiting the obedient robot tax collectors .
And collect they do .
In Illinois , for example , roving vans park on the side of the road to facilitate the mailing of citations -- carrying fines of up to $ 1,000 , plus insurance points -- to anyone driving a few miles - per - hour above the 45 MPH speed limit in a highway work zone .
( And let 's not even question the fairness of special " work zone " fines , except to point out that only about 15 percent of work zone fatalities are actually caused by automobile traffic . )
Following the lead of Illinois , Arizona will soon deploy permanently mounted speed cameras on freeways throughout the state .
In just nine months last year , a pilot program in Scottsdale , AZ mailed out 120,000 speeding tickets with a face value of nearly $ 19 million .
In other words , traffic cameras are serious business , generating more than a billion dollars every year for local governments and the insurance industry .
While the cameras certainly cramp the styles of driving enthusiasts , a closer look at their implementation reveals that they also make our roads more dangerous and our legal system less fair .
False - Positives
When jurisdictions first decide to begin photo ticketing , officials uniformly swear by the uncanny accuracy and fairness of the traffic cameras .
If you 're doing nothing wrong , they say , you need not fear our machines .
But if you think that anyone who does n't speed on public roads or run red lights has nothing to fear , think again .
Consider the case of Don Zimmerman , a Minneapolis , MN resident with a spotless driving record .
Stopped at a red light in August 2005 , Zimmerman prepared to make a left - hand turn from a one - way street onto another one - way street .
He inched his car slightly forward and allowed his front tires to cross the first line of the crosswalk .
The light turned green , and Zimmerman slowly turned his Ford Focus around the corner .
A series of flashes illuminated his rear - view mirror .
Six weeks later , Zimmerman opened his mailbox to find a $ 142 ticket for running the red light .
The ticket shocked Zimmerman , so he went online to check a video recording of the incident -- and saw that it proved nothing .
So he took the next day off from work , paid $ 20 to store his car in a downtown garage ( using a short - term metered spot would have guaranteed a parking ticket ) , and waited at city hall .
Three - and - a - half hours later , a hearing officer looked at the video and agreed that Zimmerman was innocent .
The officer then apologized because he actually had no authority to drop the fine .
Zimmerman would have to go to court for that .
Exasperated , Zimmerman decided he was n't about to pay another $ 20 and wait in line all over again .
So instead of following instructions , he called a local television news reporter who threatened to televise Zimmerman 's court hearing .
The local police captain moved swiftly to dismiss the citation .
Zimmerman 's story exposes one of the most significant problems arising from the use of machines to enforce traffic laws : Machines are incapable of fairness ( let alone basic judgment ) , and they can't be cross -examined .
This bothersome reality conflicts with the common - law principle of due process , and so our legal system must adapt to the concept of an unthinking device being the sole witnesses of a victimless crime .
Most states -- with the exception of California , Arizona and Illinois -- side - step the issue by defining photo enforcement violations as " civil infractions " instead of " crimes . "
Civil infractions were institutionalized as a way to collect parking ticket revenue ( now its own multi- billion dollar business ) while eliminating the pesky , old - fashioned concept of " innocent until proven guilty . "
The few states that maintain the criminal court system for photo tickets do so at a heavy cost :
Overburdened courts get plagued with even more dockets ( with taxpayers shouldering the bill ) , and drivers suffer higher insurance premiums for simply receiving camera citations -- the drivers ' actual guilt or innocence notwithstanding .
Camera supporters like to trumpet the point that even if a camera does make a mistake , it 's no big deal because the driver has the right to a fair hearing where the ticket can be challenged .
That 's due process enough , they say .
After all , it 's not like mistaken tickets are a regular occurrence .
Unless you 're Don Zimmerman .
In December 2005 , Zimmerman opened his mailbox and found another ticket for allegedly running a red light .
Once again he checked the online video , which clearly revealed that it was the driver in an adjacent lane who tripped the sensor .
Zimmerman bypassed his " fair hearing " and went straight to KARE television reporter Bernie Grace .
In an interview with Grace , Minneapolis Police Captain Greg Reinhardt insisted that a police officer reviews every video to ensure only the guilty receive a ticket .
Zimmerman scoffed at the notion .
" Either he has cataracts in his eyes , " Zimmerman told us , " or he 's reading the camera in Braille or something .
There 's no way anyone viewed that video . "
The Minnesota camera enforcement program , like most of its type , takes advantage of those who do n't want to go to the trouble and expense of issuing a challenge that can end up costing as much as the ticket itself .
For all but a handful of drivers , it 's much easier to write the check and be done with it .
Safety First ?
Camera supporters argue that while their brainless sentries might make occasional mistakes , they 're still worthwhile if they save just a single human life .
With speed cameras , for example , the conventional wisdom is that drivers will see the cameras , and slow down to avoid being ticketed .
Slower is safer , after all .
With red light cameras , the assumption is that drivers fearing a ticket will decide not to gun it through an intersection , potentially T - boning a car headed the other way .
Those who do receive tickets learn a valuable lesson , and share their cautionary tales with other drivers .
There can be no better way of educating the public about safe driving .
Indeed , a number of studies funded by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety ( IIHS ) claim fantastic reductions in the number of violations and accidents in areas where cameras are introduced .
But these safety claims merit a closer look -- especially when you consider that the IIHS is wholly funded by the nation 's top insurance firms , and the insurance industry makes billions from license points issued with traffic citations .
The first thing worth noting is that a high percentage of traffic camera tickets actually go to out - of - towners .
A 2006 study of speed camera tickets issued Washington , D.C. indicated that about 80 percent of the citations went to non-District residents .
( To date , the District has mailed out 2,952,333 photo fines -- the equivalent of five for each resident . )
In Loma Linda , CA , 93 percent of the violations recorded last year were issued to drivers who were passing through the city .
These numbers are relevant because negative - reinforcement therapy applied to out - of - towners does little to increase the safety consciousness of local residents .
This very issue was raised by Jim Bizieff , a police lieutenant in Union City , CA , which runs a red - light camera program .
In an internal memo to his police chief , he discussed the experience of the neighboring city of Fremont , which had a camera program of its own .
Bizieff wrote , " They believe that due to the huge volume of commuter traffic , that most violators are not local and the education / enforcement effort does not create a long - term reduction in violations for that reason . "
( View full memo in 260k PDF file )
Bizieff 's memo documents another interesting fact :
In Union City , the profit from each $ 361 red - light citation is split between the state , Union City , and Redflex , the Australian company that sets up the cameras , photographs drivers , mails the tickets , collects the cash , and , in many cases , offers the testimony in hearings .
Redflex promised Union City that its system would generate about 1,897 photos each month .
Sure enough , the first month 's numbers were just about right on the money , with $ 547,560 worth of tickets mailed .
( This dollar amounts represents about 1,500 tickets .
The Union City cameras actually photographed more cars , but some photos were thrown out because they lacked clarity , or showed police cars or ambulances tripping the camera . )
Then something interesting happened .
At one of the camera intersections ( Union City Boulevard and Lowry Road ) , the number of citations plunged from 309 in September to 80 in December .
Such a quick 58 percent drop in the number of violations would seem to indicate that the cameras were working as promised .
Or was something else going on ?
" The initial projections , as well as the first few weeks of operation , were based on faulty yellow light timings , " Bizieff 's memo explains .
" October 2005 was the first full month with the system operating with the correct yellow light timings .
There is an obvious drop - off in incidents and citations from August to October . "
To put Bizieff 's memo in perspective , it 's important to know that the duration of a yellow light has a profound effect on safety .
Imagine what would happen if you were approaching an intersection , and the light flashed yellow for just a half - second before changing to red .
If you were far enough back when the yellow flashed , you would have no problem stopping .
But picture yourself closer to the crosswalk when the light flashes yellow .
You 're now faced with a split - second decision -- either run the red light or slam on the brakes and risk a rear - end collision .
Engineers use the term " dilemma zone " to describe the moment of confusion created by inadequate yellow warning times .
Stuck in the dilemma zone , many motorists choose to run the imminent red light as the lesser of two evils .
Given the obvious importance of proper yellow light timing , you might assume Union City fixed its timing problem willingly .
You 'd be wrong .
Dave Goodson , a motorist with an engineering background , performed a number of measurements and calculations after receiving a ticket at Union City Boulevard and Lowry Road .
His case forced Union City 's traffic engineers to concede that they had set the yellow signal time 1.3 seconds too short .
The timings were n't faulty , they were illegal .
They were also profitable .
Regressing Behavior
It turns out the financial success of red light cameras depends on short yellow light durations .
According to a report by the California State Auditor , more than three out of every four red - light camera tickets were given for violations that happened when the light had been red for less than one second .
What 's more , the vast majority of the tickets were the results of infractions that happened within the blink of an eye , literally less than 0.4 seconds .
Union City 's camera vendor , Redflex , despite knowing the importance of yellow light durations to their bottom line , assured the city police that the reduction in photographed violations was only temporary .
Bizieff reported that Redflex told him that the city , " should expect a rebound in following months with citation numbers gradually approaching , but falling short of , the original numbers . "
Did this happen ?
Nope .
A year later , Union City red light violations were still down -- by 73 percent in the period since the yellow light timings were properly set .
Indeed , longer yellow timings make our roads safer .
This is backed up by the Texas Transportation Institute , which concluded that an additional second of yellow light time can cut not just violations , but also accidents by 40 percent .
Such an encouraging conclusion runs counter to what you 'll read in studies ( usually funded by the insurance industry ) that celebrate red- light cameras -- and not longer yellows -- as boons to public safety .
What these biased studies do n't explain is that a statistical phenomenon known as " regression to the mean " often explains decreasing accident rates .
Think about it this way .
When a jurisdiction decides to install traffic safety cameras , the first practical question is , Where should they be installed ?
The answer is obvious : in locations that have had a lot of accidents .
Let 's take the hypothetical example of a certain road that normally has about two fatal accidents a year .
One day , a van full of people loses control and rolls down a cliff , killing six people instantly .
That road 's fatality tally jumps to eight for that year , making it a prime candidate for camera installations .
So speed cameras are installed .
The next year , without any fluke van accidents , fatalities settle back down to two per annum .
This return to an average number is known as the regression to the mean .
You could have installed potted plants to monitor the road , and produced the same result -- but this does n't stop public officials from holding a photo op to celebrate the cameras as the cause of success .
Make no mistake , regressions to the mean are recognized by traffic engineers ; they 're just not publicized .
We give you the case of an official U.K. Department for Transport report , which attributed a 54.5 percent reduction in accidents to speed cameras .
Sadly , the fact that regression to the mean accounted for 44.1 percent of this " success " was n't mentioned until the appendix way at the end of the document .
Studying the U.K's accident rates a bit further is useful , because one can barely drive a few miles without seeing a speed camera on the island .
Indeed , the U.K. is now home to more than 6,000 cameras , and about two million drivers are ticketed every year for driving just a few miles per hour over the limit .
In 1991 , the year before speed camera citations were first issued , there was a total of 311,368 injury accidents in the U.K .
One decade and 3,561,817 automated speeding citations later , injury accidents had not declined at all -- the 2001 total stood at 313,309 , despite significant advances in trauma care , road engineering , and vehicle safety equipment , such as airbags and ABS .
After 2001 , U.K. government statistics did begin showing a decline in the number of serious accidents -- but were the stats valid ?
After all , the British Medical Journal found that the road injury rate increased slightly from 90.0 per 100,000 population in 1996 to 91.1 in 2004 , and this conclusion was drawn from the review of actual hospital records .
In explaining this discrepancy , an official government watchdog group , the Statistics Commission , said last year , " There is known undercounting of road accidents in police statistics which are used to ... inform policies on traffic safety . "
In other words , in the profit - driven world of camera enforcement , reports are being manipulated to make speed cameras appear more effective than they really are .
It gets worse when we turn our attention to red light cameras , since these devices can actually introduce hazards of their own .
When a motorist knows a camera is watching , he 's wont to slam on his brakes at a yellow light rather than risk a ticket .
In these cases , the camera does indeed keep the driver from running the red .
But if the motorist behind does n't know a camera is watching and is caught off - guard by the lead car 's sudden braking , he 'll rear - end the car that stopped early .
Indeed , studies prove that red - light cameras lead to more rear - end collisions -- in some cities up to 139 percent more , according to a 2007 study sponsored by the Virginia Department of Transportation .
Though this effect is well - documented , it 's often dismissed by camera supporters who suggest that rear - enders are merely " fender benders , " and are acceptable alternatives to the " deadly " T - bones that cameras prevent .
Sounds plausible enough , right ?
After all , when you 're struck from behind , you have a trunk and large crumple zone to protect you .
Conversely , just thin sheet metal and a pane of glass offer protection during a side impact .
Right ?
Well , it turns out that rear - end collisions can be plenty injurious .
We 'll give you the case of Winnipeg , Canada , whose city auditor obtained data on every intersection accident that occurred in town between 2002 and 2004 .
The data was collected by Manitoba Public Insurance , which , as the province 's only insurance company , had the sole burden of paying the hospital and repair bills .
Now , keep in mind , this insurance carrier was providing numbers on actual costs , not statistical estimates , which are often quoted in studies of this type .
The Winnipeg auditor found that the number of injuries at intersections with red light cameras jumped 64 percent .
The cost of property damage claims increased up to 113 percent -- all despite a significant drop in the number of T - bone collisions .
With devastating results like this , it 's difficult to see how rear - enders can be considered " low - impact " accidents .
Several U.S. studies have reached similar conclusions .
The Washington Post discovered in October 2005 that injury accidents increased 81 percent ( and total accidents doubled ) at D.C. intersections equipped with red light cameras .
In the same Virginia DOT study that reports red - light cameras cause more rear - end collisions , we learn that while T - bone accidents decreased slightly , the overall number of injury accidents increased -- by as much as 24 percent .
Follow the Money
So if safety is n't the primary motivation behind camera enforcement , what is ?
To find the answer , in 2006 a reporter for the U.K. 's Daily Mail posed as an Eastern European looking to buy a speed system .
A few cocktails at a posh restaurant brought out the truth from Jon Bond , the former Warwickshire Police Chief Superintendent and current CEO of Tele - Traffic UK Ltd. , the number one U.K. vendor of laser speed cameras .
A hidden camera captured a speed camera executive and former police chief admitting that their photo enforcement tools were part of a " scam . "
The systems make " buckets of cash , " Bond told the reporter .
" There will be so much money coming in , you wo n't know what to do with it . "
Ironically , these damning words were captured on a hidden television camera .
Profit motives also drive the issue in the United States .
In 2001 , I spoke with Ron Arnone , a former employee of Lockheed Martin IMS -- then the red light camera contractor for San Diego , California .
Arnone served as a leading witness in a criminal traffic court trial in which hundreds of defendants joined together to fight the machines that had accused them of running red lights .
Arnone told me ( as well as testified ) that money was the only topic photo enforcement employees ever talked about behind the scenes .
He said safety was the last thing on their minds , a fact confirmed by confidential memos obtained during the trial .
Judge Ronald L. Styn absorbed this information and ruled , " The evidence obtained from the red light camera system as presently operated appears so untrustworthy and unreliable that it lacks foundation and should not be admitted . "
The fact is , despite all the legal , ethical , fairness , and safety problems they introduce , traffic cameras are just too attractive a revenue source for local and state governments to turn down .
Even San Diego could n't resist re-installing cameras a few years after Styn 's rebuke .
There 's still hope , as the camera issue is blowing up in court rooms across the nation .
The Minneapolis camera program that bedeviled Don Zimmerman shut down in September 2006 after a state court of appeals found the program violated state law , a decision upheld this year by the Minnesota Supreme Court .
The Ohio Supreme Court is currently hearing a challenge to speed cameras , and early this year , court rulings forced San Jose , CA to drop the speed camera program it had operated since 1996 .
San Jose was using speed cameras despite a specific law the California legislature wrote in 2000 stating that it , " does not authorize the use of photo radar for speed enforcement purposes by any jurisdiction . "
You would think this wording is clear enough , but it 's not .
In fact , just this March , the California Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority -- a governmental group with jurisdiction that stretches from Santa Monica to Simi Valley -- signed a contract to set up speed cameras just outside the famous Hollywood Bowl .
With local governments blatantly flouting legislation , it 's clear that drivers must get directly involved to protect their rights .
Indeed , in the four times that photo ticketing has been the subject of a referendum , the people loudly and clearly said " no " each time .
Last year , for example , 76 percent of voters in Steubenville , OH rejected speed cameras .
Cameras have also been rejected in Alaska , Arkansas , Hawaii , Nebraska , Nevada , New Jersey , Utah , West Virginia and Wisconsin .
If traffic cameras are on the horizon in your area , contact your representatives and demand the public have a say in the matter .
If it 's too late and you 've received a photo ticket , fight it .
Californians , in particular , should take advantage of a free website , www.highwayrobbery.net, to learn more about how to beat automated tickets .
And all drivers would do well to heed Don Zimmerman 's advice : " Do n't ever pay a ticket until you go online , and are sure you 're guilty . "

ICELAND spends proportionately more on culture and recreation than other rich countries , with private and public spending together touching 10 % of GDP .
Its government lavishes over twice as much as others on providing sports , arts and recreational facilities for its citizens .
Britons splashed out most on household items such as tickets to sports and arts events , CDs and DVDs , gardening and pets .
Generally , wealthier countries devote more disposable income to leisure pursuits ; Ireland is an exception .

And in Baghdad , formerly protected folks were getting killed by mortar and rocket fire in what is customarily referred to as “ the highly fortified Green Zone , ” which has sequestered U.S. embassy and military officials as well as those of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government .
Two American officials and two Iraqi guards of Sunni Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi died in the Green Zone attacks .
At ABC in New York , Good Morning America ’s Diane Sawyer was trying hard Thursday to understand it all .
Shaking her head in disbelief after four straight days of attacks on the Green Zone , she asked how a round “ can actually get inside the embassy ; how fortified is that ? ”
ABC national security correspondent Jonathan Karl let her down easy , explaining that artillery fire can actually get “ over the walls ... so it does happen : they do get inside the embassy compound . ”
A teaching moment .
Mortar and artillery fire can actually get “ over the walls . ”
Quick .
Someone tell Gen. David Petraeus .
But Do n’t Bother Bush
No need to drag the president away from the Easter Bunny with such nettlesome detail .
Interestingly , it was Sawyer herself who asked Bush , during an interview on Dec. 16 , 2003 , where he gets his news and how he reacts to criticism .
The president ’s answer was revealing : “ Why even put up with it when you can get the facts elsewhere ?
I ’m a lucky man .
I ’ve got ... it ’s not just Condi and Andy [ Andy Card , former chief of staff ] , it ’s all kinds of people in my administration who are charged with different responsibilities , and they come in and say this is what ’s happening , this is n’t what ’s happening . ”
By Thursday of last week , someone did tell the president about Maliki ’s big gamble in taking on militias loyal to Muqtada al - Sadr in the Basra area , the stiff resistance Iraqi government forces encountered , and the application of U.S. ground and air support .
And someone told the president to take the line that the outbreak of major violence was “ a positive moment , ” and so that ’s what he said .
No matter that the upsurge in hostilities threatened to demolish the myth of a “ successful surge . ”
The White House spin machine could be counted on to take care of that .
And , for good measure , the shelling of the Green Zone could be blamed on Iran .
Indeed , Petraeus was quick to label the projectiles “ Iranian - provided , Iranian - made rockets . ”
Reality ?
We Make Our Own
It is comfortable to stay in denial , and President George W. Bush basks in it .
Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska saw that early on .
In June 2005 , he told U.S. News & World Report : “ The White House is completely disconnected from reality ... it ’s like they ’re just making it up as they go along . ”
Would that someone had the courage to tell Bush of the late William F. Buckley , Jr. ’s observations about Iraq in the National Review on Feb. 24 , 2006 : “ Our mission has failed because Iraqi animosities have proved uncontainable by an invading army of 130,000 Americans ...
Mr. Bush has a very difficult internal problem here because to make the kind of concession that is strategically appropriate requires a mitigation of policies he has several times affirmed in high - flown pronouncements .
His challenge is to persuade himself that he can submit to a historical reality ... different plans have to be made .
And the kernel here is the acknowledgement of defeat . ”
A few months later , on June 13 , 2006 , Bush flew to Baghdad to size up Prime Minister Maliki .
The president told American troops gathered in the “ heavily fortified Green Zone ” that he had come “ to look Prime Minister Maliki in the eyes — to determine whether or not he is as dedicated to a free Iraq as you are .
I believe he is . ”
This , of course , was not the first display of the president ’s propensity to draw significant impressions from eyeballing foreign leaders .
Five years before , Bush had quickly taken the measure of Russia ’s Vladimir Putin : “ I looked the man in the eye .
I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy ... I was able to get a sense of his soul . ”
Souls can change , I suppose .
But apparently not eyeballs .
Maliki ’s retinal scan apparently remains valid for at least two years , judging from the president ’s automatic endorsement of Maliki ’s major gamble last week in the Basra area .
Bush has now ordered U.S. ground and air units to support Maliki ’s effort .
The general objective is to root out Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army units in the area , but the campaign faces formidable obstacles and does not appear to be going well .
Does n’t Make a Lot of Sense ?
So ?...
In the past , Bush has let himself be convinced by Vice President Dick Cheney ’s “ analysis ” that increased enemy attacks were signs of desperation — an indication that the enemy is in its “ last throes , ” if you will .
And it seems clear that Cheney is still , as Col. Larry Wilkerson has put it , “ whispering in Bush ’s ear . ”
That is scary .
There were abundant signs during Cheney ’s recent visit to the Middle East that , among other things , he continues to be receptive to Israeli importuning , as Israeli president Shimon Perez put it on March 23 , to deal with what both referred to as “ the Iranian threat ” before Bush leaves office .
Bush and Cheney seem to have given Israeli leaders the impression that the Bush administration has made a commitment to do precisely that .
Gen . Brent Scowcroft , who was national security adviser to the president ’s father and who was appointed chairman of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board by the son , took the unusual step of going public with a startling remark in October 2004 that should give us all great concern .
Just before he was sacked , the usually discreet Scowcroft told the Financial Times that former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had George W. Bush “ mesmerized . ”
Eyeballing again — this time in Bush ’s direction , it appears .
And Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , with masterful tutoring from the psychologists in the Israeli Mossad , has shown he can duplicate the spell .
Who can forget watching Olmert ’s fulsome praise of George W. Bush during his recent visit to Israel and how Bush seemed to turn to putty .
Aw shucks , he seemed to be saying ; at least the Israelis respect me .
And they are “ mighty tough fellas . ”
Attacking Iran
The point is that if Cheney and Olmert both whisper “ attack Iran , ” the president may give the order with the full expectation that — with Admiral William Fallon out of the way — a malleable secretary of defense and martinet generals and admirals left over from former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ’s reign will salute smartly and launch a much wider and more dangerous war in the Persian Gulf area .
( After all , those rockets hitting the Green Zone are , according to Gen. Petraeus , “ Iranian - provided , Iranian - made . ” )
Why attack Iran ?
Israeli leaders have insisted publicly that they want this done before Bush and Cheney leave office .
And also , well , just because !
Because , as Bush is fond of saying , he is commander in chief .
And he considers the U.S. armed forces his plaything .
And because he can .
Never mind the consequences .
When has anyone had the courage to hold George W. Bush accountable for consequences ?
Worse still , Bush ’s open - ended rhetorical commitment to defend Israel if attacked could spell big trouble .
If Iran were to strike Israel , Bush has said , “ We will defend our ally ( sic ) , no ifs , ands , or buts . ”
That is great rhetoric ; trouble is that it surrenders the initiative to the Israelis , who have it within their power to provoke the Iranians .
And , Please , No Jimmy Baker Bush chafes at any thought that those he considers his father ’s cronies could rein him in .
Bete noire number one is the fella the president calls “ Jimmy Baker . ” Negotiate with Iran ?
Draw down troops ?
George W. Bush will instinctively do the opposite .
If Baker says Guantanamo should be shut down ( as he did , joining five other former secretaries of state last week ) , then keep it open .
But , most of all , enjoy the last 10 months of “ unitary executive ” power .
That is perhaps most disturbing of all .
George W. Bush is tap dancing through it all .
And the worse things get , the more jocular he seems to become .
Commenting on Bush ’s recent manic behavior , Justin Frank , M.D. , author of Bush on the Couch , suggests that Bush is “ acting like a kid planning to make a real mess as only he knows how — given his comfort with sadism ; his lack of shame or conscience ; and his propensity to take delight in breaking things . ”
Trouble is that as he tap dances the next few months away , he is systematically destroying the armed forces of the United States , and there does not seem to be anyone with the courage to try to stop him .
Eight months ago , Dr. Frank and Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) collaborated on an article we called “ Dangers of a Cornered Bush . ”
Since the president and his imperial court have 10 more months to act out , the scenarios we explored in that memo are still worth pondering .
Let me close with a remark Seymour Hersh made last year , even though it may seem flippant and in no way conveys the enormity of the danger we face in the coming months :
“ These guys are scary as hell ... you ca n’t use the word ‘ delusional , ’ for it ’s actually a medical term .
Wacky .
That ’s a fair word . ”
With so much destructive power at the disposal of George W. Bush , we need to be increasingly alert to signs that additional delusionary policies are about to be executed .

One world is dirt streaks on concrete walls , barred doors and muted dreams .
The other world is cardinal and gold in glittering cases , open doors offering endless hope .
Every morning during the football season , Ricky Rosas leaves one world for the other world .
Every morning , he leaves his East Los Angeles home to catch bus No. 720 , then transfers to bus No. 754 , then jumps out near the Vermont Street entrance to USC .
Advertisement
The trips takes 90 minutes but spans a universe .
He leaves home as a developmentally disabled teen who could not finish high school .
He arrives at USC as the football program ’s magical , mysterious Ricky .
He is 4 feet 8 .
He weighs 91 pounds .
He does n’t have a driver ’s license .
He does n’t have money .
He ca n’t sign his name .
Advertisement
But around USC , nobody ’s name has been chanted more .
Nobody has been hugged more .
Nobody has been loved more .
Nobody is richer .
“ It ’s funny how the hugest of guys take care of the littlest guy , ” Ricky says .
In one world , there are struggles to live with three others in a house with one tiny bedroom and a primitive bathroom .
His mother sleeps on the couch , his sister on the floor , Ricky on a bare mattress under a rickety bunk bed .
In the other world , there is the triumph of a job , handing out water at practice , picking up lunch for the coaches , shredding old game plans , Ricky on the sturdy foundation of importance .
Advertisement
In the one world , he has a sister who struggles with an artificial leg , a mother who ca n’t find work , two small disability checks to cover their expenses , microwave soup at the lean end of every month .
In the other world , he has a title : Special Assistant to the Head Coach .
Ricky Rosas , 18 , shakes his head .
“ It ’s amazing how far you can move up in life , you know ? ” he says .
Advertisement
Pete Carroll shakes his head .
“ How can I do this ? ” he says , repeating a question .
“ How can I not do this ? ”
After a recent USC practice in the middle of the most angst - ridden season in Carroll ’s tenure as coach , quarterback Mark Sanchez stays on the field to take extra snaps .
With the kids from the neighborhood .
Advertisement
As Sanchez is tossing passes to squealing 10 - year - old boys , Carroll takes a break from serious football talk to smile .
“ You see that over there ? ” says the coach .
“ That ’s what we do .
That ’s who we are . ”
A year ago , it was into this community connection that Ricky Rosas walked , a vulnerable Los Angeles kid peering over the wall at Los Angeles ’ most powerful football program .
Today , Rosas is running , chasing down running back Stafon Johnson after practice to show him some photos .
Advertisement
“ Slicky Ricky , how you doing , man ? ” Johnson says , lifting Rosas high off the ground .
“ This here is my man !
This here is the program ! ”
Underneath a dirty white USC cap , wearing a soiled red USC sweatshirt , Rosas beams .
The cap was given to him by one of the players .
So was the sweatshirt .
So , too , were his black shoes .
“ Only the pants were mine , ” he says proudly .
“ I ’m part of this here , you know ? ”
Advertisement
The average fan would n’t know .
During games , Ricky walks the sidelines but has no responsibilities .
He ’s swallowed up in shoulder pads and is never seen on TV .
“ But to us , he ’s everywhere , ” running back Stanley Havili says .
“ He ’s like our little brother . ”
If you ’ve attended practice or hung out at Heritage Hall during the day , you ’ve seen him .
Ricky is the tiny guy leaning against a wall during Carroll ’s mid-day news conferences , the coach ’s quiet companion , although he once corrected a reporter ’s fact and drew a huge cheer from Carroll .
Advertisement
“ Ricky , my man ! ” a jubilant Carroll shouted into the microphone .
Ricky is the hurried guy carrying big Carl ’s Jr. bags up the stairs to the coaches before practice , hanging out around their offices for anything else they need .
“ If something has to be done quick , it ’s like , ‘ OK , get Ricky , ’ ” says Jared Blank , the Trojans ’ director of player personnel .
Ricky the swaggering guy during practice , hanging out by the Gatorade table , chatting with bystanders as if he were the coach .

“ You look over at Ricky during practice , he puts a smile on your face , ” Johnson says .
Ricky is the thankful guy being hugged after practice , by Carroll , by players , by anyone who wants to soften the previous hour ’s brutality with a moment of kindness .
“ It ’s a good thing for our players to come in contact with people from different backgrounds , different places , ” Carroll says .
“ They learn how to reach out now , maybe they ’ll continue doing that later in life . ”
The reach for Ricky began three seasons ago , when he was a struggling sophomore at Garfield High , too small to play sports after his growth was stunted by childhood bone cancer , stuck with a learning disability that turned school into torture .
Advertisement
Hoping to brighten his day , a neighbor drove him to a strange place known as USC , gave him a helmet to get autographs from these strange beings known as the national champion Trojans .
“ I was n’t a USC fan , I never really followed college football , ” Ricky says .
But then , after practice , no less than Matt Leinart noticed Ricky , signed his helmet , told him a joke , won his heart .
“ I thought the USC football field was a nice place , and I wanted to go back , ” Ricky remembers .
Advertisement
Two seasons ago he returned , and this time Carroll not only signed an autograph but convinced Ricky to throw him a pass .
Then he gave Ricky an invitation .
“ You are welcome here any time , ” Carroll said .
Early last season , his schoolwork in tatters , his confidence shot , his family unable to make sense of it all , Ricky returned to the one place that had treated him like somebody special .
Says Ricky : “ I could n’t believe that Coach Carroll remembered me . ”
Advertisement
Says Carroll : “ Ricky is not somebody you easily forget . ”
Carroll asked Ricky if he needed tickets .
Ricky said he needed a job .
Carroll said he would think about it .
They could n’t pay him , but it was n’t about money .
“ I wanted to be part of this , ” Ricky says .
“ I would do anything they wanted . ”
Advertisement
Ricky noticed the heavily taped players fumbling around with Gatorade cups .
He told Carroll he would hand them their drinks .
Carroll shrugged and said sure .
A job was born .
A connection was made .
Ricky ’s mother , Michele , has never been to USC and knows nothing about the football team .
“ But they are nice to him , and that is all I need to know , ” she says .
“ That is all I need to know . ”
His family sees him disappear each morning , then return each night wearing different clothes donated by players , his belly full of training table food , and they sigh .
Advertisement
“ Whatever he is doing there , it is the biggest accomplishment of his life , ” his mother says .
His bed has no sheets , but he sleeps under a cardinal - and - gold afghan knitted by his mother .
The cluttered bedroom he shares with an uncle can barely fit a dresser , but on that dresser , under plastic , is the autographed helmet and an Orange Bowl football .
“ When I talk about the USC football team , I finally say , ‘ Us , ’ ” Ricky says .
Advertisement
With each passing week , the bond tightens .
During one pregame prayer in which the players hold hands , Johnson walked up behind Rosas and draped his arms around him , a move that Rosas proudly mimics today .
“ That meant so much to me , Stafon making me part of the team , ” he says .
During one pre-practice meeting , when the players were trying to convince Carroll to allow them to practice without shoulder pads , they begged him to let Ricky make the final call .
Advertisement
“ Rick -y ! Rick -y ! Rick-y ! ” they chanted .
Then , a couple of weeks later , the chant became a roar .
After a practice , Carroll summoned Ricky to the middle of the players ’ huddle to inform him he was going to join the team on the road in Oregon .
“ Hey , why not ?
He does n’t take up much room , ” Carroll says with a grin .
Advertisement
Ricky says he quietly cried when he heard the news .
He had never flown in a plane .
He had never stayed in a hotel room .
He had only dreamed of being part of something so big it would actually take him to another state .
“ I was in shock , ” he says .
A member of the football staff drove him to a downtown department store to buy a pair of pants , a shirt and a tie .
Another member of the staff was in charge of making sure he was buttoned and tucked .
He was so dazed on the plane , he fell asleep in a seat between two giant linemen .
Advertisement
He was further dazed when , upon arriving at the hotel , his roommates Blank and operations assistant Justin Mesa gave him one of the two beds .
“ We had to do it that way , ” Blank says .
“ Ricky had never slept in a bed that big before . ”
Before the game , he walked the field while staff members took photos of him .
You can see those photos today .
He carries them around in his sweatshirt .
The images are of a tiny guy in a rumpled shirt and loose - fitting tie , standing in the middle of a giant pristine football field , David become Goliath .
Advertisement
“ Look at me ! ” Ricky says .
“ Can you believe that ’s me ? ”
Look at the giant football program , leaning down to embrace the smallest among us .
Believe it ’s them .
Believe that , of all steamroller victories in the Pete Carroll era , none can match the gentle daily touch his team applies to the neighborhood .
As much as Trojans fans were thankful for the likes of Reggie Bush and Leinart , they should also be thankful for magical , mysterious Ricky .

“ I have to go , ” he says suddenly during an interview , standing up tall , straightening his dirty cap , adjusting his soiled sweatshirt .
“ Coach needs me . ”

Islam divides the world into two parts .
The part governed by sharia , or Islamic law , is called the Dar al - Islam , or House of Submission .
Everything else is the Dar al - Harb , or House of War , so called because it will take war — holy war , jihad — to bring it into the House of Submission .
Over the centuries , this jihad has taken a variety of forms .
Two centuries ago , for instance , Muslim pirates from North Africa captured ships and enslaved their crews , leading the U.S. to fight the Barbary Wars of 1801 –05 and 1815 .
In recent decades , the jihadists ’ weapon of choice has usually been the terrorist ’s bomb ; the use of planes as missiles on 9/11 was a variant of this method .
What has not been widely recognized is that the Ayatollah Khomeini ’s 1989 fatwa against Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie introduced a new kind of jihad .
Instead of assaulting Western ships or buildings , Khomeini took aim at a fundamental Western freedom : freedom of speech .
In recent years , other Islamists have joined this crusade , seeking to undermine Western societies ’ basic liberties and extend sharia within those societies .
The cultural jihadists have enjoyed disturbing success .
Two events in particular — the 2004 assassination in Amsterdam of Theo van Gogh in retaliation for his film about Islam ’s oppression of women , and the global wave of riots , murders , and vandalism that followed a Danish newspaper ’s 2005 publication of cartoons satirizing Mohammed — have had a massive ripple effect throughout the West .
Motivated variously , and doubtless sometimes simultaneously , by fear , misguided sympathy , and multicultural ideology — which teaches us to belittle our freedoms and to genuflect to non-Western cultures , however repressive — people at every level of Western society , but especially elites , have allowed concerns about what fundamentalist Muslims will feel , think , or do to influence their actions and expressions .
These Westerners have begun , in other words , to internalize the strictures of sharia , and thus implicitly to accept the deferential status of dhimmis — infidels living in Muslim societies .
Call it a cultural surrender .
The House of War is slowly — or not so slowly , in Europe ’s case — being absorbed into the House of Submission .
The Western media are in the driver ’s seat on this road to sharia .
Often their approach is to argue that we ’re the bad guys .
After the late Dutch sociologist - turned - politician Pim Fortuyn sounded the alarm about the danger that Europe ’s Islamization posed to democracy , elite journalists labeled him a threat .
A New York Times headline described him as marching the dutch to the right .
Dutch newspapers Het Parool and De Volkskrant compared him with Mussolini ; Trouw likened him to Hitler .
The man ( a multiculturalist , not a Muslim ) who murdered him in May 2002 seemed to echo such verdicts when explaining his motive : Fortuyn ’s views on Islam , the killer insisted , were “ dangerous . ”
Perhaps no Western media outlet has exhibited this habit of moral inversion more regularly than the BBC .
In 2006 , to take a typical example , Manchester ’s top imam told psychotherapist John Casson that he supported the death penalty for homosexuality .
Casson expressed shock — and the BBC , in a dispatch headlined imam accused of “ gay death ” slur , spun the controversy as an effort by Casson to discredit Islam .
The BBC concluded its story with comments from an Islamic Human Rights Commission spokesman , who equated Muslim attitudes toward homosexuality with those of “ other orthodox religions , such as Catholicism ” and complained that focusing on the issue was “ part of demonizing Muslims . ”
In June 2005 , the BBC aired the documentary Do n’t Panic , I ’m Islamic , which sought to portray concerns about Islamic radicalism as overblown .
This “ stunning whitewash of radical Islam , ” as Little Green Footballs blogger Charles Johnson put it , “ helped keep the British public fast asleep , a few weeks before the bombs went off in London subways and buses ” in July 2005 .
In December 2007 , it emerged that five of the documentary ’s subjects , served up on the show as examples of innocuous Muslims - next - door , had been charged in those terrorist attacks — and that BBC producers , though aware of their involvement after the attacks took place , had not reported important information about them to the police .
Press acquiescence to Muslim demands and threats is endemic .
When the Mohammed cartoons — published in September 2005 by the Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten to defy rising self - censorship after van Gogh ’s murder — were answered by worldwide violence , only one major American newspaper , the Philadelphia Inquirer , joined such European dailies as Die Welt and El País in reprinting them as a gesture of free - speech solidarity .
Editors who refused to run the images claimed that their motive was multicultural respect for Islam .
Critic Christopher
Hitchens believed otherwise , writing that he “ knew quite a number of the editors concerned and can say for a certainty that the chief motive for ‘ restraint ’ was simple fear . ”
Exemplifying the new dhimmitude , whatever its motivation , was Norway ’s leading cartoonist , Finn Graff , who had often depicted Israelis as Nazis , but who now vowed not to draw anything that might provoke Muslim wrath .
( On a positive note , this February , over a dozen Danish newspapers , joined by a number of other papers around the world , reprinted one of the original cartoons as a free - speech gesture after the arrest of three people accused of plotting to kill the artist . )
Last year brought another cartoon crisis — this time over Swedish artist Lars Vilks ’s drawings of Mohammed as a dog , which ambassadors from Muslim countries used as an excuse to demand speech limits in Sweden .
CNN reporter Paula Newton suggested that perhaps “ Vilks should have known better ” because of the Jyllands - Posten incident — as if people who make art should naturally take their marching orders from people who make death threats .
Meanwhile , The Economist depicted Vilks as an eccentric who should n’t be taken “ too seriously ” and noted approvingly that Sweden ’s prime minister , unlike Denmark ’s , invited the ambassadors “ in for a chat . ”
The elite media regularly underreport fundamentalist Muslim misbehavior or obfuscate its true nature .
After the knighting of Rushdie in 2007 unleashed yet another wave of international Islamist mayhem , Tim Rutten wrote in the Los Angeles Times : “ If you ’re wondering why you have n’t been able to follow all the columns and editorials in the American press denouncing all this homicidal nonsense , it ’s because there have n’t been any . ”
Or consider the riots that gripped immigrant suburbs in France in the autumn of 2005 .
These uprisings were largely assertions of Muslim authority over Muslim neighborhoods , and thus clearly jihadist in character .
Yet weeks passed before many American press outlets mentioned them — and when they did , they de-emphasized the rioters ’
Muslim identity ( few cited the cries of “ Allahu akbar , ” for instance ) .
Instead , they described the violence as an outburst of frustration over economic injustice .
When polls and studies of Muslims appear , the media often spin the results absurdly or drop them down the memory hole after a single news cycle .
Journalists celebrated the results of a 2007
Pew poll showing that 80 percent of American Muslims aged 18 to 29 said that they opposed suicide bombing — even though the flip side , and the real story , was that a double - digit percentage of young American Muslims admitted that they supported it .
u.s. muslims assimilated , opposed to extremism , the Washington Post rejoiced , echoing USA Today ’s american muslims reject extremes .
A 2006 Daily Telegraph survey showed that 40 percent of British Muslims wanted sharia in Britain — yet British reporters often write as though only a minuscule minority embraced such views .
After each major terrorist act since 9/11 , the press has dutifully published stories about Western Muslims fearing an “ anti-Muslim backlash ” — thus neatly shifting the focus from Islamists ’ real acts of violence to non-Muslims ’ imaginary ones .
( These backlashes , of course , never materialize . )
While books by Islam experts like Bat Ye’or and Robert Spencer , who tell difficult truths about jihad and sharia , go unreviewed in newspapers like the New York Times , the elite press legitimizes thinkers like Karen Armstrong and John Esposito , whose sugarcoated representations of Islam should have been discredited for all time by 9/11 .
The Times described Armstrong ’s hagiography of Mohammed as “ a good place to start ” learning about Islam ; in July 2007 , the Washington Post headlined a piece by Esposito want to understand islam ?
start here .
Mainstream outlets have also served up anodyne portraits of fundamentalist Muslim life .
Witness Andrea Elliott ’s affectionate three - part profile of a Brooklyn imam , which appeared in the New York Times in March 2006 .
Elliott and the Times sought to portray Reda Shata as a heroic bridge builder between two cultures , leaving readers with the comforting belief that the growth of Islam in America was not only harmless but positive , even beautiful .
Though it emerged in passing that Shata did n’t speak English , refused to shake women ’s hands , wanted to forbid music , and supported Hamas and suicide bombing , Elliott did her best to downplay such unpleasant details ; instead , she focused on sympathetic personal particulars .
“ Islam came to him softly , in the rhythms of his grandmother ’s voice ” ; “ Mr. Shata discovered love 15 years ago .
. . .
‘ She entered my heart , ‘ said the imam . ”
Elliott ’s saccharine piece won a Pulitzer Prize .
When Middle East scholar Daniel Pipes pointed out that Shata was obviously an Islamist , a writer for the Columbia Journalism Review dismissed Pipes as “ right - wing ” and insisted that Shata was “ very moderate . ”
So it goes in this upside - down , not - so - brave new media world : those who , if given the power , would subjugate infidels , oppress women , and execute apostates and homosexuals are “ moderate ” ( a moderate , these days , apparently being anybody who does n’t have explosives strapped to his body ) , while those who dare to call a spade a spade are “ Islamophobes . ”
The entertainment industry has been nearly as appalling .
During World War II , Hollywood churned out scores of films that served the war effort , but today ’s movies and TV shows , with very few exceptions , either tiptoe around Islam or whitewash it .
In the whitewash category were two sitcoms that debuted in 2007 , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ’s Little Mosque on the Prairie and CW ’s Aliens in America .
Both shows are about Muslims confronting anti-Muslim bigotry ; both take it for granted that there ’s no fundamentalist Islam problem in the West , but only an anti-Islam problem .
Muslim pressure groups have actively tried to keep movies and TV shows from portraying Islam as anything but a Religion of Peace .
For example , the Council for American - Islamic Relations successfully lobbied Paramount Pictures to change the bad guys in The Sum of All Fears ( 2002 ) from Islamist terrorists to neo -Nazis , while Fox ’s popular series 24 , after Muslims complained about a story line depicting Islamic terrorists , ran cringe - worthy public - service announcements emphasizing how nonviolent Islam was .
Earlier this year , Iranian - Danish actor Farshad Kholghi noted that , despite the cartoon controversy ’s overwhelming impact on Denmark , “ not a single movie has been made about the crisis , not a single play , not a single stand - up monologue . ”
Which , of course , is exactly what the cartoon jihadists wanted .
In April 2006 , an episode of the animated series South Park admirably mocked the wave of self - censorship that followed the Jyllands - Posten crisis — but Comedy Central censored it , replacing an image of Mohammed with a black screen and an explanatory notice .
According to series producer Anne Garefino , network executives frankly admitted that they were acting out of fear .
“ We were happy , ” she told an interviewer , “ that they did n’t try to claim that it was because of religious tolerance . ”
Then there ’s the art world .
Postmodern artists who have always striven to shock and offend now maintain piously that Islam deserves “ respect . ”
Museums and galleries have quietly taken down paintings that might upset Muslims and have put into storage manuscripts featuring images of Mohammed .
London ’s Whitechapel Art Gallery removed life - size nude dolls by surrealist artist Hans Bellmer from a 2006 exhibit just before its opening ; the official excuse was “ space constraints , ” but the curator admitted that the real reason was fear that the nudity might offend the gallery ’s Muslim neighbors .
Last November , after the cancellation of a show in The Hague of artworks depicting gay men in Mohammed masks , the artist , Sooreh Hera , charged the museum with giving in to Muslim threats .
Tim Marlow of London ’s White Cube Gallery notes that such self - censorship by artists and museums is now common , though “ very few people have explicitly admitted ” it .
British artist Grayson Perry , whose work has mercilessly mocked Christianity , is one who has — and his reluctance is n’t about multicultural sensitivity .
“ The reason I have n’t gone all out attacking Islamism in my art , ” he told the Times of London , “ is because I feel real fear that someone will slit my throat . ”
Leading liberal intellectuals and academics have shown a striking willingness to betray liberal values when it comes to pacifying Muslims .
Back in 2001 , Unni Wikan , a distinguished Norwegian cultural anthropologist and Islam expert , responded to the high rate of Muslim - on - infidel rape in Oslo by exhorting women to “ realize that we live in a multicultural society and adapt themselves to it . ”
More recently , high - profile Europe experts Ian Buruma of Bard College and Timothy Garton Ash of Oxford , while furiously denying that they advocate cultural surrender , have embraced “ accommodation , ” which sounds like a distinction without a difference .
In his book Murder in Amsterdam , Buruma approvingly quotes Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen ’s call for “ accommodation with the Muslims , ” including those “ who consciously discriminate against their women . ”
Sharia enshrines a Muslim man ’s right to beat and rape his wife , to force marriages on his daughters , and to kill them if they resist .
One wonders what female Muslims who immigrated to Europe to escape such barbarity think of this prescription .
Rowan Williams , the archbishop of Canterbury and one of Britain ’s best - known public intellectuals , suggested in February the institution of a parallel system of sharia law in Britain .
Since the Islamic Sharia Council already adjudicates Muslim marriages and divorces in the U.K. , what Williams was proposing was , as he put it , “ a much enhanced and quite sophisticated version of such a body , with increased resources . ”
Gratifyingly , his proposal , short on specifics and long on academic doublespeak ( “ I do n’t think , ” he told the BBC , “ that we should instantly spring to the conclusion that the whole of that world of jurisprudence and practice is somehow monstrously incompatible with human rights , simply because it does n’t immediately fit with how we understand it ” ) was greeted with public outrage .
Another prominent accommodationist is humanities professor Mark Lilla of Columbia University , author of an August 2007 essay in the New York Times Magazine so long and languorous , and written with such perfect academic dispassion , that many readers may have finished it without realizing that it charted a path leading straight to sharia .
Muslims ’ “ full reconciliation with modern liberal democracy cannot be expected , ” Lilla wrote .
For the West , “ coping is the order of the day , not defending high principle . ”
Revealing in this light is Buruma ’s and Garton Ash ’s treatment of author Ayaan Hirsi Ali—perhaps the greatest living champion of Western freedom in the face of creeping jihad — and of the Europe - based Muslim scholar Tariq Ramadan .
Because Hirsi
Ali refuses to compromise on liberty , Garton Ash has called her a “ simplistic . . . Enlightenment fundamentalist ” — thus implicitly equating her with the Muslim fundamentalists who have threatened to kill her — while Buruma , in several New York Times pieces , has portrayed her as a petulant naif .
( Both men have lately backed off somewhat . )
On the other hand , the professors have rhapsodized over Ramadan ’s supposed brilliance .
They are n’t alone : though he ’s clearly not the Westernized , urbane intellectual he seems to be —he refuses to condemn the stoning of adulteresses and clearly looks forward to a Europe under sharia — this grandson of Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al - Banna and protégé of Islamist scholar Yusuf al - Qaradawi regularly wins praise in bien- pensant circles as representing the best hope for long - term concord between Western Muslims and non-Muslims .
This spring , Harvard law professor Noah Feldman , writing in the New York Times Magazine , actually gave two cheers for sharia .
He contrasted it favorably with English common law , and described “ the Islamists ’ aspiration to renew old ideas of the rule of law ” as “ bold and noble . ”
With the press , the entertainment industry , and prominent liberal thinkers all refusing to defend basic Western liberties , it ’s not surprising that our political leaders have been pusillanimous , too .
After a tiny Oslo newspaper , Magazinet , reprinted the Danish cartoons in early 2006 , jihadists burned Norwegian flags and set fire to Norway ’s embassy in Syria .
Instead of standing up to the vandals , Norwegian leaders turned on Magazinet ’s editor , Vebjørn Selbekk , partially blaming him for the embassy burning and pressing him to apologize .
He finally gave way at a government - sponsored press conference , groveling before an assemblage of imams whose leader publicly forgave him and placed him under his protection .
On that terrible day , Selbekk later acknowledged , “ Norway went a long way toward allowing freedom of speech to become the Islamists ’ hostage . ”
As if that capitulation were n’t disgrace enough , an official Norwegian delegation then traveled to Qatar and implored Qaradawi — a defender of suicide bombers and the murder of Jewish children — to accept Selbekk ’s apology .
“ To meet Yusuf al - Qaradawi under the present circumstances , ” Norwegian - Iraqi writer Walid al - Kubaisi protested , was “ tantamount to granting extreme Islamists . . . a right of joint consultation regarding how Norway should be governed . ”
The UN ’s position on the question of speech versus “ respect ” for Islam was clear — and utterly at odds with its founding value of promoting human rights .
“ You do n’t joke about other people ’s religion , ” Kofi Annan lectured soon after the Magazinet incident , echoing the sermons of innumerable imams , “ and you must respect what is holy for other people . ”
In October 2006 , at a UN panel discussion called “ Cartooning for Peace , ” Under Secretary General Shashi Tharoor proposed drawing “ a very thin blue UN line . . . between freedom and responsibility . ”
( Americans might be forgiven for wondering whether that line would strike through the First Amendment . )
And in 2007 , the UN ’s Human Rights Council passed a Pakistani motion prohibiting defamation of religion .
Other Western government leaders have promoted the expansion of the Dar al - Islam .
In September 2006 , when philosophy teacher Robert Redeker went into hiding after receiving death threats over a Le Figaro op - ed on Islam , France ’s then–prime minister , Dominique de Villepin , commented that “ everyone has the right to express their opinions freely — at the same time that they respect others , of course . ”
The lesson of the Redeker affair , he said , was “ how vigilant we must be to ensure that people fully respect one another in our society . ”
Villepin got a run for his money last year from his Swedish counterpart , Fredrik Reinfeldt , who , after meeting with Muslim ambassadors to discuss the Vilks cartoons , won praise from one of them , Algeria ’s Merzak Bedjaoui , for his “ spirit of appeasement . ”
When , years after September 11 , President George W. Bush finally acknowledged publicly that the West was at war with Islamic fascism , Muslims ’ and multiculturalists ’ furious reaction made him retreat to the empty term “ war on terror . ”
Britain ’s Foreign Office has since deemed even that phrase offensive and banned its use by cabinet members ( along with “ Islamic extremism ” ) .
In January , the Home Office decided that Islamic terrorism would henceforth be described as “ anti-Islamic activity . ”
Western legislatures and courts have reinforced the “ spirit of appeasement . ”
In 2005 , Norway ’s parliament , with virtually no public discussion or media coverage , criminalized religious insults ( and placed the burden of proof on the defendant ) .
Last year , that country ’s most celebrated lawyer , Tor Erling Staff , argued that the punishment for honor killing should be less than for other murders , because it ’s arrogant for us to expect Muslim men to conform to our society ’s norms .
Also in 2007 , in one of several instances in which magistrates sworn to uphold German law have followed sharia instead , a Frankfurt judge rejected a Muslim woman ’s request for a quick divorce from her brutally abusive husband ; after all , under the Koran he had the right to beat her .
Those who dare to defy the West ’s new sharia - based strictures and speak their minds now risk prosecution in some countries .
In 2006 , legendary author Oriana Fallaci , dying of cancer , went on trial in Italy for slurring Islam ; three years earlier , she had defended herself in a French court against a similar charge .
( Fallaci was ultimately found not guilty in both cases . )
More recently , Canadian provinces ordered publisher Ezra Levant and journalist Mark Steyn to face human rights tribunals , the former for reprinting the Jyllands - Posten cartoons , the latter for writing critically about Islam in Maclean’s .
Even as Western authorities have hassled Islam ’s critics , they ’ve honored jihadists and their supporters .
In 2005 , Queen Elizabeth knighted Iqbal Sacranie of the Muslim Council of Britain , a man who had called for the death of Salman Rushdie .
Also that year , London mayor Ken Livingstone ludicrously praised Qaradawi as “ progressive ” — and , in response to gay activists who pointed out that Qaradawi had defended the death penalty for homosexuals , issued a dissertation - length dossier whitewashing the Sunni scholar and trying to blacken the activists ’ reputations .
Of all the West ’s leaders , however , few can hold a candle to Piet Hein Donner , who in 2006 , as Dutch minister of justice , said that if voters wanted to bring sharia to the Netherlands — where Muslims will soon be a majority in major cities — “ it would be a disgrace to say , ‘ This is not permitted ! ’ ”
If you do n’t find the dhimmification of politicians shocking , consider the degree to which law enforcement officers have yielded to Islamist pressure .
Last year , when “ Undercover Mosque , ” an unusually frank exposé on Britain ’s Channel 4 , showed “ moderate ” Muslim preachers calling for the beating of wives and daughters and the murder of gays and apostates , police leaped into action — reporting the station to the government communications authority , Ofcom , for stirring up racial hatred .
( Ofcom , to its credit , rejected the complaint . )
The police reaction , as James Forsyth noted in the Spectator , “ revealed a mindset that views the exposure of a problem as more of a problem than the problem itself . ”
Only days after the “ Undercover Mosque ” broadcast — in a colossal mark of indifference to the reality that it exposed — Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair announced plans to share antiterrorist intelligence with Muslim community leaders .
These plans , fortunately , were later shelved .
Canadian Muslim reformist Irshad Manji has noted that in 2006 , when 17 terrorists were arrested in Toronto on the verge of giving Canada “ its own 9/11 , ” “ the police did not mention that it had anything to do with Islam or Muslims , not a word . ”
When , after van Gogh ’s murder , a Rotterdam artist drew a street mural featuring an angel and the words thou shalt not kill , police , fearing Muslim displeasure , destroyed the mural ( and a videotape of its destruction ) .
In July 2007 , a planned TV appeal by British cops to help capture a Muslim rapist was canceled to avoid “ racist backlash . ”
And in August , the Times of London reported that “ Asian ” men ( British code for “ Muslims ” ) in the U.K. were having sex with perhaps hundreds of “ white girls as young as twelve ” — but that authorities would n’t take action for fear of “ upsetting race relations . ”
Typically , neither the Times nor government officials acknowledged that the “ Asian ” men ’s contempt for the “ white ” girls was a matter not of race but of religion .
Even military leaders are n’t immune .
In 2005 , columnist Diana West noted that America ’s Iraq commander , Lieutenant General John R. Vines , was educating his staff in Islam by giving them a reading list that “ whitewashes jihad , dhimmitude and sharia law with the works of Karen Armstrong and John Esposito ” ; two years later , West noted the unwillingness of a counterinsurgency advisor , Lieutenant Colonel David Kilcullen , to mention jihad .
In January 2008 , the Pentagon fired Stephen Coughlin , its resident expert on sharia and jihad ; reportedly , his acknowledgment that terrorism was motivated by jihad had antagonized an influential Muslim aide .
“ That Coughlin ’s analyses would even be considered ‘ controversial , ’ ” wrote Andrew Bostom , editor of The Legacy of Jihad , “ is pathognomonic of the intellectual and moral rot plaguing our efforts to combat global terrorism . ”
( Perhaps owing to public outcry , officials announced in February that Coughlin would not be dismissed after all , but instead moved to another Department of Defense position . )
Enough .
We need to recognize that the cultural jihadists hate our freedoms because those freedoms defy sharia , which they ’re determined to impose on us .
So far , they have been far less successful at rolling back freedom of speech and other liberties in the U.S. than in Europe , thanks in no small part to the First Amendment .
Yet America is proving increasingly susceptible to their pressures .
The key question for Westerners is :
Do we love our freedoms as much as they hate them ?
Many free people , alas , have become so accustomed to freedom , and to the comfortable position of not having to stand up for it , that they ’re incapable of defending it when it ’s imperiled — or even , in many cases , of recognizing that it is imperiled .
As for Muslims living in the West , surveys suggest that many of them , though not actively involved in jihad , are prepared to look on passively — and some , approvingly — while their coreligionists drag the Western world into the House of Submission .
But we certainly can’t expect them to take a stand for liberty if we do n’t stand up for it ourselves .
The White House defines “ earmarks ” in a way that applies only to projects designated by Congress , not to those requested by the administration .
“ Earmarks , ” as defined by the White House , “ are funds provided by Congress for projects or programs where the Congressional direction ( in bill or report language ) circumvents the merit - based or competitive allocation process , or specifies the location or recipient , or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to properly manage funds . ”
Sean M. Kevelighan , a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget , said : “ The administration ’s budget proposals are available for any taxpayer to see .
We submit a justification for each item .
That ’s very different from what happens on Capitol Hill , where items are dropped into legislation at the last minute , for no rhyme or reason other than the seniority of a member of Congress . ”
Democrats sometimes say the Bush administration has approved projects to help its political allies , but such assertions are hard to prove .
In the 2004 campaign , administration officials raced around the country handing out money for federal programs , including some that Mr. Bush had tried to cut or eliminate .
Senator John McCain of Arizona , the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination , is winning support with a different tactic .
Mr. McCain regularly receives cheers and applause when he declares , “ I will not sign a bill with earmarks in it , any earmarks in it . ”
It is virtually impossible to determine the dollar value of items requested by the president because they are scattered through voluminous budget documents prepared by dozens of federal offices and agencies , and the administration does not publish comprehensive lists , as Congress did last year for the first time .
Administration officials say that many projects in the president ’s budget  though they may look like Congressional earmarks  were evaluated as part of a coherent program to address some national need , like pest eradication or flood control .
Jan. 31 , 2008  --
The mother of a 27 - year - old woman accused of marrying at least five military men at bases across the country says her daughter suffers from a rare mental illness .
" This is somewhat of a shock , but I 've been expecting this , " Cindy Gibson told " Good Morning America " today about her daughter Shauna Keith 's arrest .
" For the last five or six years , I 've gotten random calls from men saying , ' I think I am married to your daughter . ' "
Gibson told " GMA " her daughter suffers from Munchausen syndrome , a disorder where a person tells fictitious stories about their health or background in order to gain sympathy and attention .
For now , Gibson 's daughter sits in the Walton County Jail in Georgia where she faces bigamy and fraud charges .
She was arrested earlier this month in South Carolina , where she was living with a Marine stationed at Parris Island .
She is being held without bond because she is considered a flight risk .
Authorities count at least five marriages starting in 1999 to men stationed at bases from San Diego to North Carolina .
Some of those marriages ended legally , but in others , she just left .
Keith , who is currently pregnant , has three children , two of whom Gibson legally adopted .
Gibson blames her daughter 's behavior on Munchausen syndrome , which is based in part , on a craving for attention .
" People with factitious disorders act this way because of an inner need to be seen as ill or injured , " the Cleveland Clinic says about the condition on its Web site .
" If the world she 's living in does n't fit her needs , she creates another reality , " said Gibson , who lives in Gresham , Ore .
Georgia authorities say that Keith 's reality has included leaving her military husbands financially and emotionally devastated and abandoning at least three children to be raised without their mother .
Walton County Sheriff 's Office Detective Jim Mayes counts seven names , five different Social Security numbers and three dates of birth used by Keith since 1999 .
At least three times , Mayes said , Keith has been married to two men at the same time .
Mayes began investigating Keith in early January , shortly after she was married to a staff sergeant Marine at a Christmas eve ceremony in Georgia .
Suspicious family members contacted police to report a possible fraud after they found a doctored license and other evidence of identity theft among Keith 's belonging , Mayes told ABC News Wednesday .
On Jan. 4 , a warrant was issued for Keith 's arrest — her birth name is Shauna Marie McDonald .
The next day , Keith was picked up in Beaufort County , S.C. , just miles from the Parris Island Marine Corps base .
She was staying with another Marine when authorities found her .
Keith waived extradition , according to Mayes , and was returned to Walton County Jan. 11 .
During Mayes ' investigation , which included interviews with Keith and conversations with Gibson , Mayes says a timeline emerged showing at least five marriages that began in 1999 when Keith married a Navy sailor based in San Diego .
Keith gave birth to her first child during that marriage , which ended in divorce .
A California court , Mayes said , gave full custody of the child to the father .
Keith then reportedly married a member of the Air Force stationed at Fort Carson , Colo .
She became pregnant during that marriage and the child was ultimately adopted by Gibson , Mayes said .
That marriage was legally dissolved after Keith left the man .
In August 2006 , Keith married again , this time to a soldier stationed at Fort Knox , Ky. Sometime around that date , Mayes said , she gave birth to a third child , whose father remains unclear .
That child was also adopted by Keith 's mother .
Soon after , she left that husband without a divorce , Mayes said , adding that the soldier has continued to work to get military officials to annul his marriage to Keith .
Just months later , in January 2007 , Keith allegedly married a fourth military man , this time someone met at Fort Riley , Kan .
In that case , the Army soldier found out that Keith was still legally married to the third husband from Fort Knox and the Army annulled the marriage , Mayes said .
After that , Keith met her most recent husband , a Marine Corps staff sergeant stationed at Cherry Point , N.C.
After talking online , they met and subsequently married in a civil ceremony Christmas eve in Walton County , Ga .
Authorities working with military investigators know that Keith never has been enlisted in the military .
But Mayes said Keith had obtained an identity card issued to military spouses that provided her free access to move on and off bases .
Keith , who could face additional fraud charges , will be represented by a public defender .

China ’s continuing crackdown on Tibetan pro-independence protesters is a big , big issue here in San Francisco .
Why , just the other day , I was coming out my front door , and there was one of my neighbors  a very nice woman in her fifties , albeit an archetypal limousine liberal , typical of the breed .
So typical that she might almost be mistaken for a living , breathing , walking , talking cliché .
She hates George W. Bush and the neocons because she ’s against the ( Iraq ) war , but she ’s eager to " liberate " Darfur  and , lately , Tibet .
That morning , as she earnestly informed me , she was on her way to a meeting of the Board of Supervisors ( our town council ) to exhort them to vote for a resolution condemning the Chinese government ’s actions and calling for " freedom " for Tibet .
What she does n’t realize , and does n’t want to know , is that she and the neocons  the very ones who brought us the Iraq war  are united on the Tibet issue .
I tried , in vain , to point this out to her , but she just shook her head , cut the conversation short , and was on her way
As it turned out , the supervisors voted for a meaningless , toothless resolution , stripped of provocative rhetoric , much to the dismay of the far - lefties who argued for a stronger statement .
The initiative for this effort was made by supervisor Chris Daly , an obnoxious left - liberal with delusions of grandeur , whose pose of self - righteousness is both grating and characteristic of his sort .
Prior to the vote on the Daly resolution , which was vociferously supported by the supposedly pacifistic supporters of the Dalai Lama , the Chinese consulate was firebombed .
This is what the War Party would like to do to China .
Fortunately , there are a number of restraining factors that get in the way : in the meantime , however , our preening politicians demagogue the China issue , and none so brazenly as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , my congressional representative , who is merely Chris Daly writ large .
Traveling all the way to India , at taxpayers ’ expense , Madam Speaker visited with the Dalai Lama at Dharamsala and announced that if Americans do n’t speak out against Beijing ’s repression in Tibet " we have lost all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world . "
Pelosi is a longtime opponent of Beijing  not just the Chinese government , but China itself .
Pelosi and the unions she depends on for political support despise all things Chinese for the simple reason that China , today , is more capitalist than the U.S.  in spite of the Chinese Communist Party ’s ostensible commitment to Marxist ideology .
Thinly veiled racist - chauvinist bilge is routinely directed at the Chinese people by union bosses and right - wing paleo - protectionists , who stupidly claim that the " chinks " ( or , as John McCain would put it , the " gooks " ) are stealing " American jobs "  as if Americans have a hereditary right to the very best salaries on earth , a " right " that does n’t have to be earned by competitive business practices but is conferred on them by virtue of their nationality .
Like hell it is .
Lucrative trade and cultural exchanges between China and California , as well as the fact that many Chinese in her congressional district have continuing ties to the mainland , have  so far  failed to deter Pelosi and her fellow Know - Nothings : politics , as they used to say during the Cultural Revolution in China , is in command .
These Sinophobic protests , engineered behind the scenes by leftist union bosses and God knows who else , are focused on the passing of the Olympic torch , which is slowly but surely making its way to Beijing , where the games are scheduled to be held Aug. 8 - 24 .
Here in the Bay Area , activists in the " Free Darfur " movement announced they were mounting demonstrations urging China to " extinguish the flames of genocide " in Darfur in San Francisco on April 9 , the day the flame passes through the city .
The hosting of the Olympic Games in Beijing is the focus of much pride in China , seen by the people as well as the ruling caste as symbolic of the nation ’s arrival in modernity .
As such , the worldwide protests and political posturing of preening politicians  from Pelosi to Nicolas Sarkozy  are bitterly resented and have been met with increasingly shrill denunciations by the Chinese state - controlled media  a sentiment that probably understates popular resentment of Western criticism in the Chinese " street . "
I know we are supposed to believe that the vast majority of the Chinese people are groaning under the weight of Commie oppression and sympathize ( albeit silently ) with the downtrodden Tibetans , but that is hardly the case .
Indeed , the exact opposite is closer to the truth .
Every time the West gets up on its high horse and lectures the Chinese government about its lack of " morality , " the tide of anti-Western Chinese nationalism rises higher .
We saw this when the U.S. " accidentally " bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during Clinton ’s Balkan War of Aggression , and again when that American spy plane went down over Hainan island .
In Beijing today , they are worried about the upcoming Olympic celebration , which will provide a platform for a wide variety of groups  including ultra-nationalist Chinese students , whose street antics have augured internal regime change in the past , and could do so again .
" They are worried about a larger number of things and they are worried about keeping the lid on , ” according to Arnold Howitt , a management specialist who oversees crisis - management training programs for Chinese government officials at Harvard University ’s Kennedy School of Government .
The same Associated Press article cites an unnamed " consultant " to the Games , who avers :
" ’ Demonstrations of all kinds are a concern , including anti-American demonstrations , ’ said the consultant , who works for Beijing ’s Olympic organizers and asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media . "
Any indications that Beijing is compromising Chinese pride and honor by appeasing the West are likely to be met by demonstrations that are both anti-American and anti-government  initiated , once again , by Chinese students , who have often been the agents of political transformation .
Remember the Red Guards ?
Mao used them to initiate his own " Cultural Revolution , " but was forced to rein them in when they started talking about overthrowing the Chinese state .
The memory of that dark and chaotic era haunts China ’s contemporary rulers , threatening to spoil their dream of a thoroughly modernized industrial powerhouse that is both the forge and the financial capital of the world economy .
The Beijing Olympics represent the entry of China onto the world stage as a first - class power , right up there with its former adversaries : the U.S. , Europe , and the former Soviet Union .
A Chinese nationalist cannot be faulted for seeing the organized campaign to spoil that debut as a deliberate  and unforgivable  insult .
Viewed from this perspective  the perspective , that is , of the average citizen of China  the very idea of Tibetan independence might easily be seen as a rather obvious attempt to humiliate Beijing and remind it of its " proper " ( i.e. , subordinate ) place in the global scheme of things .
After all , what if Chinese government leaders constantly reminded the world that the American Southwest was stolen from Mexico ?
Imagine the Chinese and Mexican ambassadors to the U.S. demanding independence , for , say , California  or better yet , its return to Mexican sovereignty !
Shall the Olympics be forever barred from Puerto Rico , which was forcibly incorporated into the U.S. " commonwealth " in the invasion of 1898 ?
Of course not .
Yet the Americans and their international amen corner are daring to criticize China for preserving its own unity and sovereignty .
It ’s a double standard made all the more insufferable by the self - righteous tone of the anti-China chorus , whose meistersingers are mainly concerned with celebrating their own moral purity .
Yes , Tibet was forcibly incorporated into the Communist empire of the Han , but this was just an episode in the long history of Sino - Tibetan relations  for the greater part of which the Tibetans held the upper hand .
The Tibetan empire , at its height , extended from northern India to the Mongolian hinterlands and came at the expense of the conquered Chinese and Uighurs .
It fell apart due to a ruinous civil war .
A key factor in this complex narrative is that Mongol hegemony over China was greatly aided by the Tibetans , whose conversion of the Mongol nobility to Buddhism legitimized Mongol rule .
Today , pro-Beijing historians point to this period as proof that Tibet has " always " been a part of China proper , yet the truth is that both were slaves to the Mongols  the Tibetans as their collaborators , the Chinese as their helots .
( Underscoring Mongol contempt for their Chinese subjects was an edict forbidding intermarriage between Mongol and Chinese , although no such barrier to Mongol - Tibetan congress was imposed . )
With Buddhism as the state religion , Tibetan priests , including the Dalai Lama , became the avatars of Mongol rule .
In short , the popular narrative of the pacifistic Buddhist Tibetans as the good guys and the Han Chinese as the bad - guy aggressors is the stuff of pure myth , pushed by union propagandists , lefty Hollywood do - gooders , and trendy sandal - wearing Western camp followers of the Dalai Lama , who has become a secularized yet " spiritual " substitute for Mother Theresa .
If the Chinese are wrong to hold on to their province of Tibet , then Lincoln was wrong to insist that the South stay in the Union  and we ought to immediately either grant the American Southwest ( and California ) independence , or else give it all back to the Mexicans .
The same goes for Taiwan 
China ’s rulers are no more likely to give up their claim to that island than Lincoln was inclined to let the Confederacy hold on in , say , Key West , Fla .
China is an adolescent giant : clumsy , unused to exerting its will beyond its borders , and wracked by self - doubt .
Emerging into the company of world powers , it is thin - skinned  like any adolescent  and prone to wild mood gyrations .
During the 1960s and ’ 70s , the Chinese were in a distinctly bad mood as they wrestled with the ghosts and demons unleashed by Mao .
The triumph of the " modernizers " over the ultra - left Maoists in the 1980s signaled a new mood of optimism and inaugurated an era of unrivaled economic growth .
The regime sanctified China ’s journey down the " capitalist road " by citing the reformer Deng Tsiao - ping ’s most famous " Communist " slogan : " To get rich is glorious ! "
Ayn Rand meets Chairman Mao ( or , rather , Confucius )  and the result is capitalism - on - steroids .
That ’s why , in spite of the sclerotic Marxoid ideology that still reins in and retards the natural entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese people , China is moving forward by leaps and bounds .
That ’s also why comrade Pelosi and her union boss buddies have launched this odious Sinophobic hate campaign  because " their " jobs and sense of entitlement are going up in smoke .
For decades , the U.S. government has preached the virtues of free enterprise and urged formerly Communist nations to adopt the free market  and now that the Chinese have taken them up on their offer , Western politicians are attacking them !
The closer China has moved toward our own system  relaxing totalitarian controls over the economy and allowing a far greater degree of ideological diversity than was possible during the Maoist era  the more hostile the U.S. government has become .
Nixon went to China at the height of the Cultural Revolution , where he sat next to Madam Mao during a command performance of The Red Detachment of Women .
These days , however , as China stakes its claim to a proportionate share of the world market  and Chinese investors fund the U.S. debt  the resentment and growing hostility of the Americans is all too palpable .
Why do politicians of Pelosi ’s ilk join hands with neoconservatives in a concerted campaign to antagonize China , and even threaten sanctions and possible military action when the occasion gives rise to the opportunity ?
To begin with , China ’s is a success story , and there ’s nothing that attracts opprobrium like success , unless it ’s success of the wrong color  in this case , yellow .
A crude racist collectivism of a specifically anti-Asian character has long been a tradition of the War Party in this country : see the anti-Japanese Dr. Seuss cartoons from the World War II era for a particularly vivid example .
Yes , he was attacking the " Japs , " but to Americans , it ’s all the same Yellow Peril .
This kind of sentiment is easily invoked in America , and do n’t tell me Pelosi and her ideological confreres are n’t aware of it  yes , even in " liberal " San Francisco , where anti-Asian sentiment is part of the city ’s history .
Never mind the first black president , or the first female president  what I ’m waiting for is the first chief executive of Asian - American descent .
I ’m not , however , holding my breath
Relations with China are cloudy , at best , and those may very well be war clouds gathering on the horizon .
The reason is that Sinophobia is a point of unity between the Left and the Right : the union of the Weekly Standard and the AFL - CIO , and perhaps even the majority of my paleoconservative friends , who quail before the rising Chinese giant and see it as a potential threat on account of its sheer scale  a third of the world ’s population , and a land - mass that rivals our own .
Surely such a stirring titan will knock us out of the way as he takes his place at the center of the world stage .
This reflects a fundamental error on the part of many conservatives , as well as liberals of the more statist persuasion .
They fail to understand that there are no conflicts of interest among nations as long as their relations are governed by the market , that is by mutually beneficial trade agreements voluntarily entered into .
Ludwig von Mises said it far better than I could ever manage , and I ’ll leave my readers to Mises ’ ministrations on this abstruse but important subject .
Suffice to say here that our relations with China on the economic front are a benefit to American consumers  that is , to all of us .
They enable us to buy inexpensive quality products and keep the cost of living down .
Protectionists who argue that " they " are " destroying American jobs " are simply arguing for higher prices  ordinarily not a very popular cause , and especially not these days .
Free trade is the economic precondition for a peaceful world and the logical corollary of a non-interventionist foreign policy .
If goods do n’t cross borders , then armies soon will  a historical truism noted by many before me , and with good reason .
Let it be a warning to all those anti-free trade , antiwar types of the Right as well as the Left  you ’ll soon be jumping on the War Party ’s bandwagon when it comes China ’s turn to play the role of global bogeyman .
The way things are going , that day may come soon enough .
Finally , a word or two about this nonsensical demand , raised by the " Save Darfur " crowd , that China must somehow " extinguish the flames of genocide " supposedly carried out by the government of Sudan .
What does China have to do with Sudan and its government ?
Well , you see , the Chinese have oil interests in the region , that is , they are engaged in competition with Western oil companies in opening up new fields  and , well , that just is n’t permissible .
The Chinese , we are told , have a moral responsibility to either pressure the Sudanese to let up on Darfur , or else abandon their Sudanese assets .
As if Sudan were a Chinese colony , and the Sudanese authorities mere sock - puppets of Beijing .
A more arrogant and self - serving argument would be hard to imagine .
Presumably Western interests will fill the vacuum left by this spontaneous display of Chinese moral rectitude  and that alone should tell us everything we need to know about what ’s behind the " Save Darfur " bloviators and their high - horse moralizing .
If our professional do - gooders of the " progressive " persuasion are so concerned about the fate of Darfur , let them campaign for the granting of mass asylum to the survivors of this latest African catastrophe .
Give them sanctuary and green cards , but keep U.S. troops out of Africa , specifically out of Darfur  and get off Beijing ’s back .
Like Russia , China is awakening from the long Leninist nightmare , albeit less traumatically , and with greater prospects for full recovery .
However , it would n’t take much to push it back into a revival of neo -Maoism  or worse  and a new dark age triggered by an external threat .
A resurgence of Chinese ultra-nationalism in response to Western pressure  and the specter of U.S. - sponsored separatism  does not augur well for the cause of world peace .
As is so often the case , we are creating the very enemies we fear , empowering and arming them ideologically .
We are , in this sense , our own worst enemies .
Driftnet
[ Home page | Software ]
Inspired by EtherPEG ( though , not owning an Apple Macintosh , I 've never actually seen it in operation ) , Driftnet is a program which listens to network traffic and picks out images from TCP streams it observes .
Fun to run on a host which sees lots of web traffic .
In an experimental enhancement , driftnet now picks out MPEG audio streams from network traffic and tries to play them .
You can also now use driftnet with Jamie Zawinski's webcollage , so that it can run as a screen saver .
( Obviously , driftnet is an invasion of privacy of a fairly blatant sort .
Also , if you are possessed of Victorian sensibilities , and share an unswitched network with others who are not , you should probably not use it .
If you 're looking for a less dubious network monitoring application , you might want to take a look at Paul Warren 's iftop . )
NTK gave me a nice write - up : ( thanks , guys )
>> TRACKING << sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering EtherPEG was a program that sniffed for JPEGs passing by on the AirPort networks at MacHack , and showed them on the huge screen to shame people into a ) turning the 802.11 encryption on , or b ) reducing amount of pr0n they download at weirdo Mac conventions .
DRIFTNET can do the same for * your * office , and make an attractive desktop accessory to boot .
The program promiscuously sniffs and decodes any JPEG downloaded by anyone on your LAN , displaying it in an attractive , ever changing mosaic of fluffy kittens , oversized navigation buttons , and blurred images of Big Brother Elizabeth fiddling .
It 's UNIX only .
Your sysadmin is undoubtedly running it already .
So stop that .
Now .

- what the world needs is Windows software to snoop on sysadmins
( Real pedants will note that I have corrected the grammar slightly .
Call themselves nasty , British and short ....)
Driftnet is in a rather early stage of development .
Translation : you may not be able to make it compile , and , if you do , it probably wo n't run quite right .
To stand a chance of compiling it , you will need libpcap , GTK , libgif / libungif and libjpeg .
If you want to play music , you need mpg123 or mpg321 or whatever .
So far , driftnet has only been tested -- I use the term in its loosest sense -- on Linux and Solaris .
If you want a Microsoft Windows version , well , go ahead and write one -- the libraries you need support Microsoft Windows too .
Driftnet is free software , licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL .
Enough already .
Where 's the code ?
Get driftnet - 0.1.6.tar.gz .
You should be able to build it by typing `make ' ; there is no autoconf script .
Please send bugfixes , suggestions and adulation to me .
You can also read the README file , changelog , and list of things to do .
Or , read the manual page .
You need libpcap , libjpeg , libungif and GTK to build driftnet , unless you want to run it in only in `adjunct ' mode .
You can also get driftnet from a public CVS server , like this :
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@sphinx.mythic-beasts.com :/home/chris/vcvs/repos login cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@sphinx.mythic-beasts.com :/home/chris/vcvs/repos co driftnet
The password is `anonymous ' .
This service is experimental , but may help you get the latest and greatest bleeding - edge version of the code .
Folkert van Heusden has created a mirror of Driftnet and other software at http://www.vanheusden.com/mirrors/.
What 's in a name ?
` Driftnet ' is supposed to conjure up images of indiscriminateness .
Think `dolphins ' .
Look !
Over there !
Civilisation is collapsing !
To my horror , somebody spotted that this program is part of an elaborate plot to undermine civilisation as we know it .
Here 's what they said ( on Freshmeat ) :
Reasons for writing such a software
by scary hans - Jul 20th 2001 14:01:02
Hello , I wonder why this software was written ?
What is its intended purpose ?
First ,
You might be able to see what kind of websites
Your users are watching and You can influence Your users .
" As You can see here , a lot of bandwith is wasted for banners , dirty stuff ... "
On the other hand , someone could misuse this tool for spying out the habits of the users .
IMHO a lot more people will use this tool for spying than for sensible purposes because
You could also see in Your proxy - logs , what kind of sites are visited .
Therefore , I think it was not a good idea to publish it , what do You think ? -- --
Air conditioned environment - do not open windows !
Note the lame pseudonym , poor grammar and crude anti-Microsoft signoff .
It 's true : my plot has been exposed by a Slashdot weenie !

What do you plan to do with your rebate ?
Only on everyday essentials
Pay down my credit cards
Save it

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Lawmakers have given their final seal of approval to a $ 170 billion plan intended to spark the slowing economy .
The plan 's centerpiece : tax rebates .
But questions remain about how the program will work , and officials at the Treasury Department and IRS are scurrying to work out the details .
In the meantime , here are some answers based on currently available government information and experts ' analysis .
Do I qualify for a rebate and how much can I expect ?
One - time rebates will be sent to at least 117 million low - and middle - income households , 20 million senior citizens living off of Social Security , and 250,000 disabled veterans .
To be eligible for a full rebate , single tax filers must have 2007 adjusted gross income ( AGI ) below $ 75,000 and joint filers must have AGI below $ 150,000 .
Adjusted gross income is not your annual salary .
It 's equal to gross income minus " above the line deductions , " which are reported on page 1 of the 1040 tax form .
Above - the - line deductions include deductible IRA contributions , alimony paid and , for the self - employed , some portion of money spent on health insurance or Social Security .
Single filers with AGI below $ 75,000 will get rebates of as much as $ 600 .
Couples with AGI below $ 150,000 will receive rebates of up to $ 1,200 .
In addition , parents will also receive $ 300 rebates per child under 17 ; there is no cap on the number of qualifying children eligible .
An example : A couple with one child and $ 100,000 in AGI will get a rebate of $ 1,500 ( $ 1,200 + $ 300 ) .
If they have two children , they will get $ 1,800 ( $ 1,200 + $ 600 ) .
Tax filers who do not owe income taxes because of various credits and deductions but have at least $ 3,000 in income - which can include Social Security and disability payments - will get $ 300 rebates per person or $ 600 per couple .
Tax filers who do not owe income taxes because of various credits and deductions but have at least $ 3,000 in earned income or $ 3,000 in Social Security benefits or certain veteran 's benefits will get $ 300 rebates per person or $ 600 per couple .
I make more than the income caps .
What about me ?
You might get a partial rebate .
It depends on how much your income exceeds the caps .
The stimulus legislation allows for a 5 % phaseout rate for households above the income caps of $ 75,000 for single filers and $ 150,000 for joint filers .
That means that for every dollar a tax filer earns above those caps , he or she will lose 5 cents of the rebate , said Jason Furman , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
Put another way , the rebates of those taxpayers will be reduced by the amount of income above the cap multiplied by 5 % , said Mark Luscombe , principal analyst at tax information publisher CCH .
Take a couple with two children .
If they make less than the income cap , they will likely get an $ 1,800 rebate .
If they make $ 15,000 more than the cap , they will see their $ 1,800 rebate reduced by $ 750 ( $ 15,000 x 0.05 ) .
So instead they will receive a check for $ 1,050 ( $ 1,800 - $ 750 ) .
A childless couple whose AGI falls below the cap will likely get a $ 1,200 rebate .
But if their AGI exceeds the cap by $ 15,000 , their rebate will be reduced by $ 750 .
So they 'd get a check for $ 450 .
Single filers with no kids and an income below $ 75,000 will likely get a $ 600 rebate .
But if they made $ 80,000 , their rebate will be reduced by $ 250 ( $ 5,000 x 0.05 ) .
So they will get a check for $ 350 ( $ 600 - $ 250 ) .
The point at which the rebate gets phased out entirely will vary .
For example , a single filer with no kids whose income exceeds the cap by $ 12,000 or more will get no rebate , because it will be reduced by an amount equal to or greater than the $ 600 ( $ 12,000 x 0.05 = $ 600 ) .
Do I have to pay the rebate back ?
No .
And here 's why .
Your rebate is a one - time tax cut - an advance on a credit you 'll receive on your 2008 return .
It 's based on your 2007 income initially .
If it turns out that your 2008 income and number of children would have qualified you for a larger rebate than the one you received , you 'll be sent the difference .
If it turns out your 2008 income was lower than in 2007 and you should have gotten a lower rebate , you get to keep the difference .
" If you were supposed to receive a larger payment than you did , you will get the extra money , " said Treasury spokesman Andrew DeSouza .
" If you received more than what you should have gotten , you will not be penalized . "
What do I have to do to get one ?
You must file a federal tax return for 2007 .
Some people are normally not required to file a return .
To get the rebate , however , they have to file a federal tax return .
So when will I get a check ?
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Thursday night that the IRS will start sending out checks in early May .
Last month , he said it should take about 10 weeks to crank out all the checks .
In all likelihood then , you 'll see the money sometime between May and early July .
That assumes , of course , that you hit the IRS deadline and file by April 15 .
If you 're a laggard and have to file for an extension , you 'll still get a check but it may not come until the end of the year - probably in time for Christmas shopping .

Roller - skating under cars might seem impossible , but it is the latest craze among kids in India and requires the flexibility , strength and balance of a gymnast .
Six - year - old Aniket Chindak holds the unofficial world record for ' limbo - skating ' and speeds along no more than eight - inches above the ground .
Unfolding his body from his eye - watering position , the wonder - kid explained proudly how he is training to break his own world record of skating under 57 cars in 45 seconds .
Scroll down for more ...
" I first saw a girl skate under a car on TV two years ago and decided to learn how to do it myself , " he said .
" It took three months before I could get my body in the right position .
Since then I have skated under lots of cars and have never hurt myself . "
Aniket , who trains four - hours per day , started skating when he was 18 - months - old .
After smashing the world record of 43 cars in March he started training to skate under 100 cars .
" The hardest thing is to go fast enough before I bend down , because that 's how you can skate under so many cars at once , " he said .
Scroll down for more ...
According to his father , Ramesh , the skating marvel covers 60 - miles twice a week in practice and sulks when he is told to finish .
" Aniket had a passion for skating right from the day he learnt it , " he said .
" He has been skating long distances for the last three years but since he started limbo - skating his passion has increased .
" Aniket was always very flexible but for limbo - skating you need strength as well .
It took him a while to condition his body to hold the correct position - now his battle is to get the speed and control necessary for 100 cars .
" He wants to set a world record no one can beat for a long time . "
A new device may make car chases a thing of the past .
Eureka Aerospace , a company from Pasadena , Calif. , had developed a device that shoots a microwave beam at a speeding car , frying its electrical system and stopping the car dead in its tracks .
To disable cars , the device generates energy that is amplified by a generator , and then converted to microwave radiation .
The radiation is then focused with a special antenna into a narrow beam , and aimed at a car 's headlights , tail lights , lug nuts , frame bolts , or windshield antenna .
It 's essential to hit these vulnerable electrical parts because , especially in newer cars , there are lots of plastic parts and rustproof paint that prevents electricity from conducting , and the computers are designed to withstand high electromagnetic energy .
In tests , the beam could hit any of these exposed electrical parts from 10 to 50 feet away .
A pulse lasting just 50 nanoseconds is enough to overload wires or damage the car 's central microprocessor .
At a high power of 300 megahertz ( compared to 2.45 gigahertz in a microwave ) , the radiation energy is above common radio frequencies , and is n't harmful to humans .
The company hopes the device will help police officers in areas with long flat highways , such as southern California , where car chases are fairly common .
The new technology could allow police officers to choose to stop a car in a location where it would be difficult for the driver to attempt to flee on foot .
The current prototype of the device is about 5 feet long , 3 feet wide , and weighs nearly 200 pounds .
Since it 's too hefty to fit in a car , the researchers tested the device from rooftops .
However , in the future , the company hopes to shrink the device to 50 pounds and about TV - size , with the ability to fry a car from up to 600 feet away .

In the handful of years Senator Barack Obama has spent in the national spotlight , his stance toward his pastor has gone from glowing praise to growing distance to  as of Friday  strong criticism .
On Friday , Mr. Obama called a grab bag of statements by his longtime minister , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , “ inflammatory and appalling . ”
“ I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue , ” he wrote in a campaign statement that was his strongest in a series of public disavowals of his pastor ’s views over the past year .
Earlier in the week , several television stations played clips in which Mr. Wright , of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago , referred to the United States as the “ U.S. of K.K.K. A. ” and said the Sept. 11 attacks were a result of corrupt American foreign policy .
When the chef Heston Blumenthal acquired the Hinds Head Hotel in Bray , England , in 2004 , he really just wanted the attached offices and parking for his three - Michelin - star restaurant , the Fat Duck , next door .
What he got instead was an 18th - century pub .
Rather than serve his trademark better - eating - through - chemistry fare ( sardine - on - toast sorbet , etc. ) , Blumenthal realized that he was going to have to stick to traditional English dishes like steak and kidney pudding , Lancashire hot pot and the like to avoid being run out of town by angry old men .
One day , while looking for inspiration in his collection of medieval and Tudor cookbooks , he recalled a conversation he had at an Oxford symposium two years before with Marc Meltonville , a ceramic historian turned food archaeologist who was restoring the 55 - room kitchens of Hampton Court Palace , which reopened to the public this month .
In order to learn how things were done in the time of Henry VIII , Meltonville 's team recreates not only period dishes like spinach - and - date fritters and spit - roasted meat but also all of the utensils used to prepare them .
In that first conversation , Blumenthal regaled Meltonville with a fantasy recipe , one he discovered in a translation of an old French cookbook .
To give you a sense of Blumenthal 's devilish enthusiasm and curiosity , listen to how he recounted the recipe to me ( my highly professional responses are in italics ) :
" I had came across a manuscript of Le Viander de Taillevent .
He was the chef to the Palais Royal in Paris .
I think it was the 14th century .. . . And in there was this wonderful  wonderful ?
fascinating as opposed to wonderful ; it 's not the right word  recipe for how to roast a chicken .
You take the chicken , and you pluck the chicken while it 's still alive , and you baste the skin with a mixture of soya , wheat germ and dripping , I think it was .
And apparently this makes it look like the skin 's been roasted .
You then put the head of this live chicken under its tummy and rock it to sleep .
Then you get two other chickens and you roast them .
And you bring these three chickens out on a tray to the table .
You start carving one of the roasted chickens .
And . . . the one that is still alive but sleeping goes sort of ' Wha ! '  head pops up  and it runs off down the table . "
Oh , my God .
" And that 's Part 1 .
Then you take this poor chicken , and you kill it , and you stuff its neck with a mixture of quicksilver , which is mercury , and sulfur , and then stitch it up .
And apparently  obviously I have n't tried this at home , or at work  the expanding air in the neck cavity as you roast causes the mercury and the sulfur to react and somehow creates a clucking noise . "
Oh , my God .
" And then you bring this clucking chicken back to the table .
So you 've taken a live chicken and made it appear dead , and then you 've brought it back to life again . "

Congressman Dennis Kucinich revealed that he is initiating an investigation of the insider trading that took place leading up to 9/11 , particularly in regards to put options placed on American Airlines and United Airlines stock .
Kucinich said that he had personal questions about the implications insider trading had .
" I ’ve indicated a long - standing interest in gathering information and trying to get to the bottom of exactly what happened with respect to all the stock activity that took place preceding 9/11 . "
Kucinich said .
Kucinich said it was the bizarre record - level put options that caught his attention initially .
The odd trades heavily indicate prior knowledge of the September 11 attacks and have raised a number of questions that Kucinich hopes to probe .
" First of all , I ’m not afraid to ask questions about 9/11 , " Kucinich told the Alex Jones Show .
" From my own personal standpoint , I ’ve had long - standing questions about why this volume , why those airlines , why that time , who made the buys , why did they buy them , who told them to make the buys , who was involved ?
There are questions there that need to be answered as part of an effort to get to the truth , " Kucinich said .
He made clear he was not yet pointing the finger .
" I do n’t know what happened .
I ’m not alleging anything here .
But I sure want to find out how it happened . "
But Kucinich hopes that inquiries in a committee hearing would clarify the information and answer questions .
" I think we need to talk to the people who were involved in making those transactions in order to try to figure out why they were made , for example , American Airlines and United Airlines stock . "
Kucinich said .
At least two FBI agents have been previously charged for their smaller roles in the insider trading .
The NY Times has reported on the cases , but larger coverage of the issue has been largely ignored by the mainstream media , and no larger probe has been underway until now .
Kucinich has also promised to hold hearings on the health of 9/11 first responders .
He has already met with a number of rescue workers to hear their stories and is in the process of bringing forth information to committee .
The Congressman warned , however , that his seat has been hotly contested by ‘ Cleveland corporate interests ’ who have sunk millions into defeating Kucinich .
He pleaded for help to win his local election , but remained steadfast .
" I ca n’t be bought and I ca n’t be bossed . "
Kucinich said .
" I ’m going to keep speaking the truth , I ’m going to keep seeking the truth , and as long as people are there to support that , I ’ll be in Congress . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton got to work on health care reform within days of her arrival at the White House as first lady in 1993 , newly released documents show .
The National Archives on Wednesday released 11,000 pages of Hillary Clinton 's schedule as first lady .
Her first meeting on the subject came on January 23 , 1993 , only three days after her husband Bill Clinton 's inauguration as president , and dozens of related events followed .
Despite her efforts , the Clinton health care reform foundered in Congress .
The National Archives on Wednesday released more than 11,000 pages of Sen. Hillary Clinton 's schedule when she was first lady .
Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign pushed for the documents ' release , arguing that their review is necessary to make a full evaluation of Clinton 's experience as first lady .
The documents cover nearly 2,900 days .
An additional 27 days will be posted in the near future , the archives said .
The documents are among those at the center of a legal battle between the archives and Judicial Watch , a conservative public interest group that has long urged a speedier release of files from the Clinton White House years .
Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch , said the trove of documents " shows she was a co-president , " revealing an " extraordinary extent of meetings for an unelected official to be meeting with cabinet officials . "
In a court motion this month , the archives promised to release the schedules by the end of the month but said it will need " one to two years " to process remaining documents , including more than 20,000 pages of call logs -- well after the November 4 presidential election .
According to the archives statement , 4,746 of the schedules have redactions , information removed before being released , that largely relate to privacy concerns including Social Security and telephone numbers and home addresses .
" We 'll look them over , and may ask the court for relief if it looks like something important is missing , " Fitton said of the redacted information .
He said Judicial Watch continues to demand phone logs from Clinton 's time in the White House .
The papers show Hillary Clinton had no public schedule on the day independent counsel Kenneth Starr was appointed to investigate Bill Clinton 's affair with Monica Lewinsky , or on the day Bill Clinton was deposed in the case .
On the day the affair began , Hillary Clinton had a private meeting and a meet - and - greet with then - Vice - President Al Gore and Nobel Prize winners .
She kept up a busy schedule as the affair spiraled into impeachment .
Some events on the schedule might prompt a chuckle , such as a note on the day when the House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton over the Lewinsky affair that a holiday party dance between the president and first lady was " optional . "
The documents are from the files of Patti Solis Doyle , director of Clinton 's scheduling as first lady , the archives said in a statement .
Doyle stepped down as Clinton 's presidential campaign manager in February after a string of poor showings in primaries .
" Arranged chronologically , these records document in detail the activities of the first lady , including meetings , trips , speaking engagements and social activities for the eight years of the Clinton administration , " the archives said .
The records were simultaneously released on CD - ROM at the William J. Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock , Arkansas , and at the archives in Washington .
The documents will be available for view on the Clinton Library 's Web site .

All About Hillary Clinton • National Archives and Records Administration
The Republican Party once claimed to oppose wasteful government spending .
Republicans criticized Democrats for pushing ever more money for foreign aid and welfare , irrespective of results .
When GOP candidates advocated increased military outlays during the Cold War , they pointed to genuine threats as justification .
Republicans are now the party of spend , spend , spend .
Under a GOP president and Congress , domestic outlays went up faster than at any time since President Lyndon Johnson ’s Great Society .
Moreover , Republican presidential candidates are seeking to outbid each other in demanding ever more military expenditures , irrespective of need .
Of course , the unnecessary Iraq war , which has consumed hundreds of billions in cash as well as thousands of lives , is one factor .
Rather than include war outlays in its formal budget proposals , the Bush administration has attempted to disguise the cost by putting predictable spending into irregular supplementals .
Last spring the Bush administration proposed a mammoth $ 715 billion military spending package : $ 481 billion for normal operations and $ 142 billion for Iraq in 2008 , plus $ 93 billion to cover war costs that year , in addition to $ 70 billion for Iraq that was previously approved .
Unfortunately , no end of Iraq spending is in sight , since all GOP candidates save Rep. Ron Paul want to continue the misguided conflict indefinitely .
Indeed , Sen. John McCain said it would be fine with him if America occupied Iraq for another 100 years .
But Iraq is only a small factor for today ’s spendthrift hawks , who want to lavish money on everything everywhere .
American foreign policy determines U.S. defense needs and thus military outlays .
That is , the defense budget is the price of America ’s foreign policy .
The more interventionist the U.S. strategy , the bigger and more expensive the military must be .
So how much should the U.S. spend on defense ?
A lot more if one listens to the presidential contenders .
Even some of the Democrats have been playing a game of “ me - too , ” proposing a military build - up without putting a price tag on it .
For instance , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) advocates adding 92,000 personnel .
Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) promises “ to expand and modernize the military . ”
But the Republican candidates unashamedly propose spending more money , lots more .
Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani advocates adding ten combat brigades plus hardware .
He puts no price on his plan .
But Giuliani argues that “ The idea of a post - Cold War ‘ peace dividend ’ was a serious mistake  the product of wishful thinking and the opposite of true realism . ”
Apparently the Soviet Union never was an important factor in U.S. defense planning .
Thus , rebuilding the military , as Giuliani put it , would undoubtedly cost a lot .
Former Governor Mitt Romney similarly believes that Americans have “ let down our defenses . ”
Thus , he wrote , “ We need to increase our investment in national defense . ”
He wants the U.S. to add at least 100,000 troops and commit to spend “ a minimum of four percent of GDP on national defense . ”
Also pushing a firm floor of four percent GDP for defense is the Heritage Foundation and former Sen. Jim Talent .
He and Mackenzie Eaglen cite the request by various military leaders for more money , noting that “ the number , size , and duration of military deployments have increased dramatically since the end of the Cold War . ”
Thus , they conclude , “ Policymakers who say that they support a strong military should be judged by whether or not they support spending a minimum of 4 percent of GDP on the regular defense budget over the next decade . ”
Heritage calls this the “ 4 % for Freedom Solution . ”
Fred Thompson , another former Senator , and presidential candidate , would up the ante .
He echoes Giuliani in complaining of “ one of the largest unilateral reductions of military power in history . ”
So he advocates an even larger troop build - up , of nearly 300,000 .
And that means spending 4.5 percent of GDP on the military , not counting the tens of billions necessary for Afghanistan and Iraq .
Well , at least he argued that we should spend all that money “ carefully and wisely , ” as the Pentagon and Uncle Sam always do , in a speech in South Carolina , the site of Saturday ’s primary .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) supports the Bush administration troop build - up of nearly 100,000 and wants to raise the bet by adding another 150,000 personnel for the Army and Marine Corps .
He , like Giuliani , does not estimate costs .
No wonder he voted against the Bush tax cuts : who knows what other wars President “ Bomb , Bomb , Bomb Iran ” McCain would have to fund ?
But these candidates are pikers compared to former Governor Mike Huckabee .
He advocates speeding up the administration ’s planned troop hike of 92,000 .
Even more incredibly , he wrote : “ Right now , we are spending about 3.9 percent of our GDP on defense , compared with about six percent in 1986 , under President Ronald Reagan .
We need to return to that six percent level . ”
That would be $ 800 billion this year alone .
Even if this figure included outlays for Afghanistan and Iraq , it would reflect a truly massive military build - up .
What could possibly justify such huge increases in military spending ?
Jim
Talent spoke for all the spendthrift hawks when he wrote : “ the situation facing the U.S. military is grave . ”
There are too few personnel .
Too little new hardware .
Insufficient investment in modernization .
And so on .
Talent puts much store in the fact that Pentagon officials want more money .
But as Ted Galen Carpenter of the Cato Institute points out : “ most of us are neither surprised nor unduly impressed that officials of a government bureaucracy would like to maximize the budget of their bureaucracy .
I would venture to say that leaders of the Department of Education or the Department of Agriculture undoubtedly feel the same about their organization ’s funding level . ”
Even granting the case for increased military spending , the level should be determined by the security needs of the moment .
There is no reason a priori to believe that the right amount will constitute 4.0 or 4.5 or 6.0 percent this year , next year , or beyond .
The economy ’s size and growth are unrelated to national security threats .
Comparisons with the GDP percentage years or decades ago are meaningless given how the U.S. economy has grown : Between 1960 and 2005 real GDP more than quadrupled .
Has the world really gotten four times as dangerous , requiring a fourfold increase in defense outlays , which would have resulted from tying military spending to GDP ?
Anyway , if the world is so dangerous , then why should the U.S. not spend even more ?
During the early years of the Cold War military expenditures broke ten percent of GDP .
During the Korean War defense spending hit 14.2 percent of GDP .
During World War II military outlays peaked at 37.8 percent of GDP .
So perhaps Washington should maintain military outlays at ten percent of GDP .
After all , the world is dangerous and we are rich .
That would be almost $ 1.4 trillion for the military this year , almost triple the rest of the world .
But how could we be sure that was enough ?
Fourteen percent would be safer .
And what ’s a paltry $ 2 trillion among friends ?
Still , even that seems risky , given how the GOP contenders view the world  the U.S. as a helpless midget being swarmed by evildoers .
Why not go for the World War II level ?
Surely $ 5 trillion is not too much to spend to be secure !
By advocating an arbitrary and artificial spending level , these conservatives sound like liberals on domestic policy : spend money , as much money as possible , irrespective of need or effectiveness .
Yet how can anyone seriously argue that the U.S. military is weak and in dire need of more money ?
Today America devotes about 4.1 percent of GDP to the military .
The U.S. is committing more than a half trillion dollars to defense , not just the most of any country , but roughly as much as the rest of the world combined  even more , 57 percent of outlays in 2008 , according to the organization Global Security .
That is an extraordinary number .
Richard Betts of Columbia University notes that such levels “ cannot be justified based on any actual threats that the U.S. armed forces might plausibly be expected to encounter .
The military capabilities of the United States need to be kept comfortably superior to those of present and potential enemies .
But they should be measured relatively , against those enemies ’ capabilities , and not against the limits of what is technologically possible or based on some vague urge to have more . ”
Nevertheless , argued Fred Thompson , we are in “ a New World , all right  with new threats rising up in place of old , ” most notably that of terrorism .
Thus , “ we have asked our military to take on an ever - greater role in our defense ” but provided it with less money .
Even more dramatic is Talent ’s claim :
" The world today is , on balance , at least as dangerous as it was at the end of the Cold War .
The U.S. is no longer in danger of a massive nuclear attack , nor is a major land war in Europe likely , but the threats we face are no less serious .
America is engaged in a war against terrorism that will last for years .
The danger of a rogue missile attack is greater than ever .
China is emerging as a peer competitor much faster than most of us expected , and Russia ’s brief experiment with democracy is failing . "
Actually , Talent does n’t believe the world is at least as dangerous as before .
He believes that we are at even greater risk .
He explained : “ We live in a multipolar world with threats that are highly unpredictable and therefore , taken as a whole , more dangerous than the threats we faced during the Cold War . ”
This is not a serious argument .
Those years of competing nuclear arsenals , armored divisions , air wings , and carrier groups ?
That time of having to defend war - ravaged allies from an aggressive Soviet Union , unpredictable Maoist China , and various European and Third World communist satellites ?
Child ’s play compared to confronting Osama bin Laden with his vast legions and armaments , lapping at America ’s shores .
It is depressing to think that Talent once served in the U.S. Senate .
There are three fundamental problems with the “ America as helpless midget ” thesis .
The first is that today ’s threat environment is nothing like that during the Cold War .
To claim that today ’s dangers “ are no less serious ” than before is frankly bizarre .
Terrorism , a la 9/11 , is horrid , but the potential consequences are nothing like that of even a small nuclear strike .
Moreover , such terrorism is best met by a combination of sophisticated intelligence , international cooperation , law enforcement , and special forces rather than huge militaries and preventive wars .
“ The hype employed by some conservative panic mongers to the contrary , the terrorist threat is not the functional equivalent of World War III , and we do not need to fund the military as though it is ” observed Carpenter .
The threat of nuclear terrorism or a rogue state missile attack is real  though thankfully very unlikely  and must be guarded against .
But , again , there is no comparison with the possibility of a full - scale nuclear exchange incinerating the planet .
The Soviet Union had the means to destroy America ; the U.S. and the USSR came dangerously close to conflict during the Cuban Missile Crisis ; the two countries spent decades sparring around the globe , luckily avoiding a multitude of tripwires for war .
Moreover , the possibility of a serious conventional conflict , which could be as destructive as a small nuclear strike  witness the impact of World War II  is essentially zero .
Whatever the vagaries of Russian politics today , there is no prospect of the Red Army rolling from Moscow to the Atlantic .
Russia has neither the will nor the ability to do so , under Vladimir Putin or anyone else .
Putin wants a strong , assertive Russia , not another world war with Russian cities again reduced to rubble .
His countrymen are no different .
Nor is a more assertive China any substitute for aggressive hegemonic communism exemplified by Joseph Stalin ’s Soviet Union , Mao Zedong ’s China , several Warsaw Pact countries , and a gaggle of Third World revolutionary states .
Beijing is decades away from being a peer competitor of America : Estimates of Chinese military spending vary , but the most authoritative top out around $ 125 billion .
Thus , the “ worst case ” wins Beijing second place in the world , but still barely a quarter of American outlays .
Some analysts have argued that China gets much more for its money , based on the economic comparisons of purchasing power parity versus exchange rate GDP estimates .
But the analysis has limited applicability in measuring the quantity and quality of military assets .
Moreover , though China is improving its forces , it is starting at a very low base  it has no aircraft carriers , for instance , compared to 12 for America .
Beijing lacks the nuclear subs , large - scale blue water navy , quality armored divisions , sophisticated air wings , and massive nuclear arsenal possessed by America .
That does n’t mean China ’s military build - up is benign from Washington ’s standpoint .
But Beijing is concentrating on creating a military capable of deterring American intervention , not attacking the U.S.
Even the spendthrift hawks admit as much .
Writes Heritage ’s John J. Thacik , Jr. , “ The ultimate question must be whether Beijing ’s leaders have any purpose in assembling a military machine worthy of a superpower other than to have the strength to challenge the United States ’ strategic position in Asia . ”
But preserving U.S. predominance in Asia is not the same as defending America .
The “ danger ” that Talent , Thompson , and others fearfully cite does not involve aggression against America .
The spendthrift hawks worry that the U.S. will be unable to attack countries on the neoconservative enemy ’s list for one or another imagined offense .
However , few , if any such conflicts would involve vital American interests .
The second point is that preventive intervention in the name of promoting U.S. security almost always worsens problems .
Talent claimed : “ In the end , it would take a lot more than 4 percent of our GDP to defend a ‘ Fortress America ’  an America that allows dangers to fester and grow until they are strong enough to attack us in our homeland . ”
If social engineering wo n’t work in America , why should we expect it to work overseas , despite different histories , cultures , ethnicities , religions , traditions , and more ?
Economists have long analyzed the reasons government so badly ( mis ) manages the economy , no matter how bright the analysts and dedicated the politicians .
Yet military intervention is even more problematic than economic intervention .
It is impossible to look years ahead and divine the likely intentions and capabilities of other states .
It is foolish to assume that bombing is the best means to resolve “ festering problems . ”
War is always unpredictable and almost always turns out far worse than expected  just look at the many occasions when aggressors lost .
The distant and inadvertent impacts of war often swallow up the more predictable immediate effects .
Iraq is an obvious case in point .
The Bush administration took the U.S. into war based on a nonexistent threat .
Rather than deliver worldly nirvana , the U.S. occupation triggered bloody sectarian strife , generated regional instability , and encouraged global terrorism .
So much for Talent ’s strategy of intervening early to save money .
Intervention is working almost as well in Pakistan .
It ’s a wonderful theory : micro-manage Pakistan ’s political and economic development so we wo n’t have to worry about nuclear proliferation , jihadist terrorism , authoritarian rule , tribal antagonism , politics by assassination , ethnic and sectarian strife , rampant anti-Americanism , and political instability .
Great idea .
We certainly would n’t want problems to fester , costing the U.S. more in the long - term .
Absolutely .
Even the so - called rogue states like Iran and North Korea possess minuscule militaries compared to that of America , and can be deterred by existing forces .
Indeed , America ’s military budget is 30 times that of Cuba , Iran , Libya , North Korea , Sudan , and Syria combined .
Does Talent & Co. really believe that spending as much as every other country combined is n’t enough to prevent these , along with other formidable military powers such as Burma and Somalia , from attacking America ?
Third , the U.S. is not alone in its fight for truth , justice , democracy , and whatever else the spendthrift hawks claim to be promoting .
Rather , America is allied with every major industrialized state .
Washington also is friendly with most regional powers which are n’t formal allies , such as Argentina , Brazil , India , Indonesia , Kenya , Nigeria , and South Africa .
Europe possesses a much larger population and a somewhat larger economy than America , let alone Russia .
Japan has the second largest economy on earth and a potent military ; Australia , Singapore , and the ASEAN states also are capable regional players able to cooperate in matching China .
South Korea has 40 times the GDP and twice the population of the North .
So why ca n’t America ’s allies and friends defend themselves and their regions ?
Or do the spendthrift hawks believe that the U.S. has to protect itself from its allies as well ?
That New Zealand , perhaps , has a burning desire to dominate the globe and is plotting a preemptive strike against America ?
In short , the problem of defense spending is a consequence of an hyper - interventionist foreign policy .
Argues Columbia ’s Betts : “ Washington spends so much and yet feels so insecure because U.S. policymakers have lost the ability to think clearly about defense policy . ”
America protects prosperous and populous states from nonexistent , potential , and unlikely threats .
Washington attempts to remake failed states and reorder unstable regions that are largely irrelevant to American security .
Only occasionally does the U.S. military actually defend this country against genuine dangers .
The point is not just that Washington cannot afford to be a global social engineer and cop .
But it is not in America ’s interest to be an international nag and meddler , especially at such a high price .
Even if promiscuous intervention did not tend to turn out so badly , the American people have far better uses for the lives and money currently being squandered by Washington ’s imperial policy .
America is by far the most powerful nation on earth .
It would remain the most powerful nation on earth even if it cut military outlays .
What the U.S. needs is not a bigger military budget , but a more restrained foreign policy .
That is , a foreign policy for a republic rather than an empire .
The euro has risen by almost 20 % against the dollar in the past 12 months
The euro 's strength against the dollar may explain a rise in the availability of cocaine in Europe and a decline in the US , a US anti-drugs official says .
John Walters , director of US national drug control policy , said the amount of cocaine seized at the US south - western borders had declined .
The price and the purity of cocaine in US have also fallen , he said .
Meanwhile , Europe has seen a huge increase in availability as traffickers take advantage of the exchange rate .
Speaking in Brussels , Mr Walters expressed concern about the rise in Colombian cocaine coming to Europe via Venezuela and West African .
" There have been speculations that the power and strength of the euro and the cost of cocaine here in Europe have been the reason here for the movement - it's more profitable and it's a better currency exchange , " he said .
" There 's no doubt that those forces are there . "
The euro has risen by almost 20 % against the dollar in the past 12 months to hit a record above $ 1.59 .
On Friday , the euro fetched $ 1.5825 .
The euro has become an attractive currency for investors because of relatively high interest rates in the eurozone .
The US dollar , meanwhile , has suffered because of a number of factors including a slowing economy , low interest rates and problems from the credit crisis .
Pi can be found in the design of the pyramids at Giza
By David Blatner
It 's Pi Day , a celebration of the mathematical ratio that man has been trying to unlock for millennia .
But why are we driven to find the answers behind it ?
As we 're all taught at school , pi represents the number you get when you divide the distance around a circle ( its circumference ) by the distance across ( the diameter ) .
With just a string and a ruler you can quickly measure that pi must be just over three - and - an - eighth ( 3.125 ) .
With more precise measurements , you may be able to narrow it down to 3.14 .
SLICE OF PI 3.1415926535 8979323846 2643383279 5028841971
However , if you ask a typical maths nerd , you 'll get an earful of pi - 3.14159265 and so on .
A surprising number of students have memorised 50 or even 100 digits after the decimal point .
The rough ratio of pi 3.14 gives us the date for Pi Day .
March 14 , or 3/14 in American dating style , makes sense for a celebration of this famous constant .
Coincidentally , Pi Day is also the birthday of Albert Einstein , who no doubt knew more than a little about pi .
Pi Day celebrants , usually children with an enthusiastic teacher and a varying degree of personal interest in the subject , learn about pi , circles , and , if they 're lucky , eat baked pies of various sorts .
Famous constant
Some classes offer prizes for memorising the most digits of pi , or for creating interesting mnemonic devices .
Count the letters in each word of this classic poem :
Sir , I bear a rhyme excelling
In mystic force and magic spelling .
Pi , more commonly known by the 16th letter of the Greek alphabet , is the most widely - known mathematical constant in the world .
Even long after people forget their school lessons , they still recognise the symbol .
Aliens / hoaxers also need pi Pi conjures a sense of mystery , so the symbol makes regular appearances in popular culture - it's the secret code in both Alfred Hitchcock 's Torn Curtain and the Sandra Bullock vehicle The Net .
And while pi is a number , its importance goes far beyond simple geometry .
Pi represents a deep universal mystery - how is it that something this basic , this fundamental to maths and science , could turn out to be so incredibly difficult to pin down ?
In fact , it 's literally impossible to know what pi is , because its digits rattle off into infinity .
While there are many infinitely long numbers in maths , pi is the only one in which an infinitely simple idea - the circle - unfolds into an infinitely complex value .
This paradox drives many people to distraction .
Life 's work
One of the most endearing and enduring qualities of humans is that we 're so often sure that we can find the answer to any problem if we just try hard enough .
For 3,500 years , humankind has attempted to solve the puzzle of pi , also called " squaring the circle " , calculating the exact ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter .
However , no matter how hard anyone tries , they find only a new approximation .
In ancient Greece , the great mathematician Archimedes worked tirelessly to discover the ratio , uncovering only a few digits of accuracy .
When he tried to stop a Roman soldier from blundering over his work by shouting " do not touch my circles " he was unceremoniously murdered .
Pi is in art
By the time Ludolf van Ceulen died in 1610 , he had spent many years of his life tediously calculating pi , resulting in only 35 accurate digits .
And in 1873 , William Shanks announced he had found 707 digits over years of hand - cramping work ; unfortunately , he had made a mistake after the 527th place .
The following digits were all wrong .
The most recent attempt , by a Japanese computer scientist in 2002 , found 1.24 trillion digits of pi .
To put all this in perspective , even an astrophysicist , attempting to measure galaxies , would never need more than 10 or 15 digits of precision .
But pi beckons us on further .
Some mathematicians believe that if we could only find some pattern in pi , even some hint that there were more fours than sevens , it could lead to a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the universe .
The late physicist Carl Sagan , in his novel Contact , imagined a time when Earth scientists were sufficiently able to unravel enough of pi to find encoded messages from our creators - messages that would allow our primitive race to leap into a greater universal awareness .
After all , if you were going to hide a long numeric message in the very fabric of our reality , pi would be a natural place to do it .
Fundamental equations Nevertheless , pi continues to frustrate .
In the late 19th Century , it was categorically proven that pi was infinitely long and could not be solved with any finite number of equations .
That has n't stopped modern - day circle - squarers , who continue to claim that mathematicians are wrong and that pi is really just 3 or 3.25 or some other finite - but - erroneous answer .
Pi Day is a time to honour not just a number and our fascination with it , but also the essential truth that there are some things we simply cannot know .
We can only get close to knowing .
We have pi in our eyes Pi shows up everywhere .
In mathematics , pi appears in many fundamental equations that have nothing to do with circles .
In science , pi is inextricable from measuring everything from ocean waves to economic statistics .
Pi is found in the very measurements of the Great Pyramid at Giza .
And if you divide the length of a river from source to mouth across a gently sloping plane by its direct length " as the crow flies " , you 'll find pi .
Pi also appears where you least expect it .
Religious scholars point to the Old Testament which , when describing the measurements of Solomon 's Temple , implies that pi is only three .
In the transcripts of the famed OJ Simpson trial , you can find arguments between the judge and an FBI agent about the actual value of pi .
For a time , Givenchy offered a men's cologne emblazoned only with the symbol .
Nobel Prize winner Wislawa Szymborska wrote a poem about pi , and pop star Kate Bush sang 100 digits of pi on her album Aerial .
In this age of high - tech precision instruments , where we assure ourselves that perfection is attainable , pi is an ever - present , sometimes grating reminder that there are puzzles that can be solved and there are mysteries that , perhaps , can not .
David Blatner is the author of The Joy of Pi. Below is a selection of your comments .
Funny about Carl Sagan expecting to find encoded messages in Pi .
It 's an infinite series , which means that any message you want to find will be there somewhere .

My old maths teacher used to hold the world record for reciting pi , and once spent a lesson reciting the first thousand for " Children in Need " whilst we all checked a huge list of random numbers to spot if he made any errors .
Well , it was better than a real maths lesson .

The value and usage of pi is only theoretical as it's impossible to create a perfect circle .
There will be always some miniscule anomaly in its shape - even if you go right down to atomic level .
Kenny Laing , Grantham , UK Every time we ask our computer to generate a random number ( which might show up , for example , as a random letter or word , or as random movements in a game ) we are using pi .
A computer on its own cannot create a truly random number so it uses the apparently random sequence of digits in pi to produce a very good approximation of randomness .
Tony Palmer , Watford , UK " Squaring the circle " has nothing to do with working our the value of pi - it refers to the problem of constructing a square from a circle , where the square is to have the same area as the circle .

Eating Feta cheese made from raw milk in small seaside tavernas when you are on holiday in Greece could be a good way to combat food poisoning , according to researchers speaking April 3 , 2008 at the Society for General Microbiology 's 162nd meeting being held at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre .
" We were able to isolate lactic acid bacteria found in raw sheep milk from small farms in Macedonia , northern Greece .
Several of these friendly bacteria naturally produce antibiotics that killed off dangerous food - poisoning bacteria like Listeria , " says Panagiotis Chanos , a researcher from the University of Lincoln .
" Interestingly , we identified these friendly bacteria as enterococci , more commonly recognised as virulent and / or antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospitals .
We found some strains could produce up to three different natural substances to fight different food pathogens . "
The unique taste of many local cheeses , especially from Greece and other parts of the Mediterranean , is mainly due to the enterococcal bacteria they contain .
Apart from their sometimes sinister role when antibiotic resistant strains cause hospital infections , enterococci are important in the food flavouring and manufacturing industries .
Listeria is one of the most dangerous food poisoning bacteria because it can survive in places and conditions that other bacteria cannot .
It can be found in foods made from animal products as a result of poor heat processing or mishandling , which causes post - production contamination , for example when butchers or retailers fail to wash their hands between touching cooked pies and raw meats .
" We hope that this work will lead to ways of fighting foodborne pathogens , using the naturally produced compounds called bacteriocins made by other bacteria , " says Mr Chanos .
" We discovered that all the useful strains of bacteria that produced bacteriocins were able to grow in extreme conditions resembling those commonly found in foods , including the low temperatures found in our refrigerators and the salty conditions found in some cheese . "
Instead of putting additives and synthetic preservatives in foods , the scientists hope they can harness the properties of the useful bacteria to use them as micro-allies against disease - causing bacteria like Listeria .
Listeria is particularly dangerous , causing food poisoning or even death in vulnerable people like children and the elderly , and in pregnant women where it commonly triggers miscarriages .
Patients on medication for cancer or HIV , or with heart , liver or kidney transplants are also particularly at risk as their immune systems are weakened .
" It is known that enterococci in general may have the same properties as good gut bacteria .
We hope our bacteria possess these properties too , so they could colonise our small intestine and fight Listeria from within the body , " says Panagiotis Chanos .
" If we can ensure the safety of these useful bacteria , they could guard us humans by killing foodborne pathogens , "
The researchers hope to minimise the use of ' not - so - friendly ' synthetic preservatives in foods by replacing them with naturally produced bacteriocins , which may open up new opportunities for organic food production .
I 'm not surprised .
All politicians lie through their teeth ...
Officially , the libertarian world view is equally distant from standard liberal and conservative political views .
See for example , the World 's Smallest Political Quiz , where liberals like social but not economic freedom , and conservatives like economic but not social freedom .
In practice , however , libertarians hang out more with conservatives than liberals .
At least they do in the academic and think tank worlds I know .
I 've been attending some " liberaltarian " dinners arranged by CATO 's Brink Lindsey , where we discuss commonalities and differences of liberals and libertarians .
So I 've been pondering why libertarians seem to connect more with conservatives than liberals .
Some say it is just a natural alliance of outsiders , but it seems more to me than that .
Some say it is because conservatives are more willing to adopt libertarian rhetoric in national politics , but that is just more data to explain .
Tyler Cowen 's insight that ideology is mainly about who gets respect suggests an answer to me : libertarian heroes are more like conservative than liberal heroes .
In the conservative view , we should most respect the pillars of local communities : dependable connected leaders who respect authority , do their job , help their neighbors , raise their kids , go to church , and go to war when needed .
In the liberal view , we should most respect passionate cosmopolitan subgroup activists : folks who identify strongly with an oft - disliked non-geographically - defined subgroup and who via sheer impressiveness of art or word gain their group a wider respect .
In the libertarian view , we should most respect " self - made " men or women , able to achieve glory with minimal help from government , family , or community , if only such meddling outsiders would get out of the way .
Libertarians support low taxes because individuals should be free to choose how their money is spent , rather than being forced to accept collective choices .
Conservatives support low taxes so that those who have worked hard for their money can show off the fruits of their labor and earn full respect for it .
Libertarians support gay marriage because individuals should be free to have whatever consenting relations they want .
Liberals support gay marriage because they want us all to officially respect gays as much as straights ; gay activists have earned their group more respect .
It seems to me that libertarian self - made heroes are more similar to conservative community pillars than to liberal subgroup activists .
Self - made men are mostly not made in the bedroom ; their glory shows more in their income than in their subgroup identity .
Perhaps some future Ayn Rand
Two will describe new compelling libertarian hero characters , who are more like liberal activist heroes .
But until then I predict conservatives and libertarians will remain closer than official libertarian doctrine can explain .
Added 25 May : Andrew Gelman comments here , and Tyler says not to forget the villans , a great suggestion .
I should say this was an attempt to identify the signaling persona behind common ideologies , not the conscious rationalizations people give .
And that I 'm not at all confident in this .
Also , it would have been better to say that libertarians support low taxes and gay marrriage because such policies allow self - made heroes to make more of themselves .
Christian Pulisic became the most expensive American soccer player in history after completing a transfer to English club Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday .
Chelsea paid 64 million euros ( $ 73 million ) for the 20 - year - old United States winger , who will be loaned back to Dortmund for the rest of this season .
The German club wo n't have to pay Chelsea for the loan .
The fee is easily the biggest paid for an American player , surpassing the reported 20 million euros ( $ 22.5 million ) spent by German team Wolfsburg for John Brooks in 2017 .
" It was always Christian 's big dream to play in the Premier League , " Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc said .
" That certainly has to do with his American origins , and so it was n't possible for us to extend his contract . "
The Hershey , Pennsylvania native 's contract with Dortmund was due to expire at the end of next season .
" It is a privilege to have signed for such a legendary club , " Pulisic said of the London team that has won five Premier League titles since 2005 .
It is the most high - profile move secured by an American outfield player , with goalkeepers Tim Howard having previously played for Manchester United and Brad Friedel for Liverpool .
Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia said the club has signed " one of Europe 's most sought - after young players . "
" At just 20 , we believe he has the potential to become an important Chelsea player for many years to come , " she said .
Pulisic , who can play on either wing or behind the striker , has recently lost his place in Dortmund 's team to English youngster Jadon Sancho , signed from Manchester City for 8 million pounds ( $ 10 million ) in the offseason of 2017 .
In a message posted on his Twitter account , Pulisic urged Dortmund fans to " not doubt my passion , determination and my 110 percent commitment to the team right until the last ball is kicked this season . "
Dortmund leads the German league by six points heading into the second half of the season and is through to the last 16 of the Champions League , where it plays Tottenham .
Chelsea is fourth in the Premier League , 11 points behind first - place Liverpool after 20 games .
" Driving laws " cover a wide range of driving - related offenses .
For minor traffic infractions — like speeding , running a stop sign or red light , and texting - while - driving — a violation typically involves only a fine and points being assessed to your driving record .
But more serious driving offenses — such as reckless driving and vehicular homicide — can result in jail or prison time .
This site provides information on various driving - related charges , including how these offenses are defined , the consequences of a violation , and possible defenses .

Comcast announced today that it will focus on aggressively deploying a DOCSIS 3.0 infrastructure in 2008 ; the company intends to offer DOCSIS 3.0 capability in 20 percent of its market area by the end of the year .
Currently the cable industry depends on the DOCSIS 1.1 specification , but that standard is limited to 36 M bps down and 10 M bps up .
Cable companies may have made a name for themselves as speed kings early in the broadband wars , but the current bandwith limitations of DOCSIS 1.1 leave it looking paltry indeed when compared to Verizon 's FiOS 50 M bps down / 30 M bps up packages .
DOCSIS 3.0 wo n't completely close the gap between cable and fiber , but its transfer rates of up to 160 Mpbs down and 120 M bps up will still offer a considerable improvement over currently deployed equipment .
DOCSIS has already proven it 's capable of delivering higher throughput speeds — last year Korean cable operator ARRIS demonstrated a pre-DOCSIS 3.0 network capable of delivering content above 100 M bps per second .
DOCSIS 3.0 also offers additional features that make it an attractive update , including enhanced network management and better security features .
While not as fast as FiOS , DOCSIS should be easier ( and cheaper ) to deploy .
Unsurprisingly , Comcast plans to focus its rollout in market areas where the cable provider is already facing strong competition from Verizon .
If you 're a cable subscriber in Massachusetts or Virginia , 2008 may be a banner year for upgrading to a new tier of service .
Those in areas where Comcast rules the roost in terms of speed will likely have to wait their turn , though the company will almost certainly focus buildout efforts in major cities .
Although full compliance with the DOCSIS specification requires the bonding of at least four upstream and four downstream channels , Comcast 's first implementation of the standard will be downstream - only .
According to Cable Digital News , that 's not due to Comcast cutting corners — DOCSIS upstream channel bonding probably wo n't be available until late 2008 - early 2009 .
Up until now , Verizon 's FiOS has largely been in a class of its own .
AT&T's U - Verse may compete for the same market , but FiOS can provide a bandwidth pipe that simply blows AT&T 6 M bps service out of the water .
Once DOCSIS 3.0 comes online , cable companies could potentially hit Verizon hard by offering enough bandwidth to satisfy the type of customer that would 've once had no choice but FiOS , while offering their service at a lower price .
And because of its decision to run fiber to the node and rely on copper for the last link to the home , AT&T will be sitting at the bottom of the bandwidth well looking up at both Verizon and Comcast — and other cable companies once they roll out DOCSIS 3.0 .
It 'll still be years before a majority of consumers are DOCSIS 3.0 - capable , but the first competitive rumblings are scheduled to start by the end of next year .
" Its is equivalent to building the great wall of China " - and now it 's destroyed - in the name of science .

Germany 's cut - price supermarket chain Lidl was accused yesterday of using Stasi methods to spy on its staff and collect intimate details about their personal lives , including their relationships , bank accounts and the frequency of their lavatory breaks .
The allegations were published in Stern magazine , which said it had obtained hundreds of pages of surveillance reports compiled on Lidl staff in Germany and the Czech Republic by private detectives contracted to spy on employees .
Stern said the information was collected with miniature cameras that were set up in stores with the excuse that they were needed to deter shoplifters .
The magazine said the style of the surveillance was almost identical to that used by the former East Germany 's notorious Stasi secret police .
One excerpt read : " Wednesday 14.05 .
Mrs M , wants to make a mobile phone call during her break , but she receives a message telling her that she has only got 85 cents left on her prepaid phone account .
She finally manages to get in touch with a girlfriend with whom she would like to cook supper , but she insists that her pay must have reached her bank account by then otherwise she wo n't have any shopping money . "

Another report from a Lidl store in the Czech Republic revealed that women staff members were banned from using the lavatory during their shifts .
The only exception were women who were having their period .
According to Stern , they were obliged to wear a headband , " visible from a distance " , to denote the fact .
Other surveillance report entries included a comment by a detective who made disparaging remarks about a Lidl cashier 's " self - made " tattoos .
He suggested that she should be asked to cover them up because elderly customers might assume that she got them in prison .
Lidl did not deny the existence of the reports but insisted that they were intended to expose " possible staff misconduct " .
A spokesman said , however , thatthe allegations concerning the store in the Czech Republic were " not known to us in reality " .
Peter Schaar , Germany 's data protection officer , described the reports as a " grave infringement " and the state of Baden - Württemberg , where Lidl has its headquarters , said it was beginning an immediate investigation into the allegations under the country 's data protection laws .
Achim Neumann , a spokesman for the German shopworkers ' union Verdi , said : " This kind of surveillance is conducted by totalitarian states .
Germany does not need companies like this . "
Allegations that Lidl grossly mistreated its staff first surfaced in 2004 when Verdi published a so - called " Black Book " report based on interviews with Lidl employees .
The union alleged that the company routinely interrogated staff and forced them to do unpaid work outside shop hours .
One former Lidl cashier told Verdi : " I did not even have time to go to the toilet .
Leaving the till meant being told off , so I sometimes went home with wet underwear . "
At the time , Lidl dismissed Verdi 's allegations as a " defamation campaign " .
Lidl has outlets in 23 countries in Europe .
Jeff Gilbride / Daily News staff — As U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Stanley Elementary School yesterday , a small group of protesters gathered outside demanding she use her congressional powers to impeach President George Bush .
Holding signs simply reading “ Impeach ” and others offering statistics on deaths caused by the war in Iraq , about a dozen protesters held a silent demonstration yesterday on the sidewalk opposite the school on South Street .
“ Pelosi has the power to bring bills to the floor or not bring bills to the floor .
She ’s not been using that power , ” said Sandy Coy of Wayland , who said she was alerted to Pelosi ’s visit through an e-mail network .
“ How often do we get a chance to put our message out there to impeach the President George Bush and ( Vice President ) Dick Cheney and end the war ? ”
Coy said she is a member of the Congressional District 7 Chapter of Progressive Democrats of America , an organization founded in 2004 to effect change in the Democratic Party and the country .
When Pelosi was slated to become House speaker she declared that impeachment was “ off the table . ”
Stan Robinson , a radio talk show host on WZBC 90.3 FM , said he was also protesting to spur Pelosi into bringing impeachment proceedings .
“ Pelosi is the key to impeachment , ” Robinson said .
“ Impeachment is a different problem than normal congressional acts because impeachment does n’t have to withstand a veto .
She really does have the power . ”
Will Leggett made the trip from his home in Sudbury to protest .
“ I ’m here just to impeach ( President Bush ) for things like lying to us , getting us into a war that costs $ 3 trillion dollars and for the felony of disobeying the ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) laws , ” Leggett said .
Wearing a button that read “ support the troops , bring them home now , ” Maureen Kelley of Natick said she came to offer a visual message to Pelosi concerning her unhappiness over the war in Iraq .
“ I ’m here because every time I hear about someone else ’s son or father killed in Iraq I just want to scream , ” she said .
“ This war is a lie .
It ’s all because of ( oil ) . ”
Kelley said she holds peace vigils with Coy every Thursday night at the corner of routes 30 and 27 in Cochituate .
Given the grim economic news across the Atlantic , the last place people might want to put their £ 7,000 annual individual savings account ( ISA ) allowance would be in a fund investing in America .
But there is at least one good argument for looking to the US – the current weakness of the dollar .
Investing in the US involves a degree of currency speculation : when an investment is bought , pounds are converted into dollars ; when sold , the reverse happens .
If in the interim the dollar increases in value against the pound , that automatically increases returns .
Short - term speculating on currency movements is a game for the experts and even they often get it wrong .
But economists insist that the pound cannot remain at its current elevated level for ever .
In short , there is a good chance UK investors in the US will benefit from a strengthening dollar .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
However , any bonus from currency moves could be offset if the fund itself performs poorly .
So the question remains : is this the right time to be looking stateside ?
Tom Walker , who runs the US fund at fund manager Martin Currie , says : " There has been a lot of poor economic data and people are understandably worried .
But we do n't believe the US will lag behind for ever .
What you have to remember is that this is a very dynamic market with some of the best companies in the world . "
Philip Shaw , an economist with Investec , is more cautious : " Sterling is fundamentally overvalued against the dollar .
Over the next five years , it will have to fall back into line .
But it would be difficult to say whether now is a good time to invest in US stocks . "
Mark Dampier , research director at independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown , warns : " Part of the problem is that it 's so hard to find US funds with any sort of consistency of performance . "
He rates the Martin Currie North America fund , Neptune 's US Opportunities and , more debatably , Legg Mason 's US Equity , which has n't been faring well .
" That fund has been really poor over the past two years or so , but good managers do n't become bad ones overnight .
It can be a good time to invest in a fund after it has had a difficult couple of years . "
Overall , though , Mr Dampier is not sure now is the right moment to go into US shares .
" Given all the credit problems , we have n't seen that much of a correction in share prices , " he says .
" I 'd rather wait to see some real signs that things are starting to pick up . "
FERDINAND PIËCH is two steps closer to realising his dream : the creation of a new European automotive giant .
On March 3rd he and his colleagues on the supervisory board of Porsche Automobil Holding gave the go - ahead for Porsche , a maker of sports cars , to buy another 20 % of Volkswagen ( VW ) , Europe 's biggest carmaker .
Porsche already owns 31 % of VW , so this will give it a controlling majority .
A few hours earlier VW itself , of which Mr Piëch is chairman , announced a takeover of Scania , a Swedish truckmaker , paying € 2.9 billion ( $ 4.4 billion ) to increase its stake from 31 % to 68.6 % .
The resulting concern , under the umbrella of Porsche Holding , will have sales of around € 120 billion and will sell 6.7 m vehicles a year .
Its biggest markets will be Europe , Asia and South America ; cracking North America may be a job for the 70 - year - old Mr Piëch 's successor .
MAN , a truckmaker in which VW owns a 29.9 % stake , may be rolled in later .
Porsche has plenty of cash .
In the 18 months to January 31st it earned € 4.5 billion in windfall profits from options it bought on VW shares .
It has also lined up € 10 billion in credit ( roughly the amount needed to buy 20 % of VW ) from friendly banks .
A remaining obstacle is Germany 's VW Law , which limits any shareholder 's voting rights to 20 % .
Last October the European Court ordered Germany to abolish it .
The new draft of the law is not exactly capital - friendly : Brigitte Zypries , Germany 's justice minister , wants Lower Saxony , which has a 20 % stake in VW , to retain the right to veto big commercial decisions , such as relocating factories .
But even that clause is not likely to deter Mr Piëch and Wendelin Wiedeking , Porsche 's tough - minded chief executive .
Mr Wiedeking has not disguised the fact that he wants to change VW 's culture from a socialised , semi-protected concern to a capital - efficient machine like Porsche .
That means putting an end to the cosy relations between VW 's management and workforce .
This week 's news paves the way for Porsche 's takeover of VW and puts an end to the long - running tussle between VW , MAN and Scania .
But the balance of power between Mr Piëch , who holds 46.3 % of Porsche Holding , the Porsche family , which owns 53.7 % , and Mr Wiedeking remains unclear .
So there is still plenty of scope for drama .
US intelligence does not show Syrian nuclear weapons program , officials say
Cheney hand seen behind leaks of ' misleading ' stories
Allegations that a Syrian envoy admitted during a United Nations meeting Oct. 17 that an Israeli air strike hit a nuclear facility in September are inaccurate and have raised the ire of some in the US intelligence community , who see the Vice Presidents hand as allegedly being behind the disinformation .
A United Nations press release discussing the General Assemblys Disarmament Committee meeting mistranslated comments ascribed to an unnamed Syrian diplomat as saying that Israel had on various occasions taken action against nuclear facilities , including the 6 July attack in Syria . 
The UN has since gone through the tape recordings of the meeting and found that there was no mention of the word nuclear at all .
According to the UN , the error was one of translation , involving several interpreters translating the same meeting .
Recent news articles , however , continue to make allegations and suggest that a nuclear weapons facility was hit -- something that the Syrian government has denied , the Israeli government has not officially confirmed and US intelligence does not show .
According to current and former intelligence sources , the US intelligence community has seen no evidence of a nuclear facility being hit .
US intelligence found no radiation signatures after the bombing , so there was no uranium or plutonium present ,  said one official , wishing to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject .
 We do n't have any independent intelligence that it was a nuclear facility -- only the assertions by the Israelis and some ambiguous satellite photography from them that shows a building , which the Syrians admitted was a military facility . 
Their statements come as officials claim Syria has begun to ' disassemble ' the site .
An article today quotes former Administration hawk and onetime Bush United Nations Ambassador John Bolton , who links Syria 's alleged action with Iran .
Israel has not spoken publicly about the air raid , other than to confirm that it happened .
The confirmation came nearly a month after the Sept. 6 bombing , and provided only that  Israeli officials said the strike took place deep inside Syria . 
" ' Radiation signatures ' are just the particular type of radiation that some activity would give off , " Dr. Ivan Oelrich , a nuclear weapons expert at the Strategic Security Project at the Federation of American Scientists , told RAW STORY .
" For example , a nuclear bomb would produce a lot of radioactivity and a nuclear reactor explosion would produce a lot of radioactivity but if you measure it carefully so you can tell , not just that it is radioactive , but exactly what particular isotopes are contributing , then it is easy to tell the difference .
" If a reactor explodes or is blown up then I can , with careful measurements of the particular types of radiation , tell what the fuel was for the reactor and how long the reactor had been running when it was hit , " Oelrich added .
" It gets complicated because you have to take into account how different species are transported in the air , how fast they decay , etc. but it can be done . "
An earlier report by Raw Story cited Vincent Cannistraro , Director of Intelligence Programs for the National Security Council under President Ronald Reagan and Chief of Operations at the Central Intelligence Agency 's Counterterrorism Center under President George H. W. Bush , as saying that what the Israelis hit was " absolutely not a nuclear weapons facility . "
The Central Intelligence Agency , through a spokesman , declined to comment .
Administration said to leak stories to press
One US intelligence source familiar with the events expressed concern about recent news reports describing Syria as having a functioning nuclear weapons program and cautioned against attributing those reports to the US intelligence community .
 The allegations that North Korea was helping to build a nuclear reactor have not been substantiated by US intelligence ,  said this intelligence official , adding ,  but that has n't stopped Dick Cheney and his minions at the NSC , Elliot Abrams and Steve Hadley , from leaking the information [ to the press ] , which appears to be misleading in the extreme . 
Requests for comment to the National Security Council went unanswered .
Elliot Abrams , who currently serves as the Deputy National Security Adviser for Global Democracy Strategy , was convicted during the Iran - Contra scandal for withholding information from Congress .
He was pardoned by President George H. W. Bush along with other Iran - Contra players , some of whom have reappeared in the current Bush administration .
Iran Contra was a criminal scandal in which the Reagan - Bush White House sold weapons to Iran  an avowed enemy of the United States  then funneled the money to extremist anti-Communist group of guerrilla fighters called the Contras , who were fighting the democratically elected government of Nicaragua .
A failed coup in 2002 against Venezuelan President , Hugo Chavez , is also attributed to the approval of Abrams , according to an investigation by the UK Guardian .
Prior to the Iraq war , now - National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley was an integral part of misleading intelligence dissemination and approved clandestine meetings between Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar and members of a secretive cabal inside the Department of Defenses controversial Office of Special Plans .
During a 2006 interview with neoconservative scholar Michael Ledeen , Raw Story was able to obtain the first on the record confirmation of the trips having been approved by the National Security Council , including the then National Security Advisor , Condoleezza Rice :
 Obviously Hadley did not unilaterally do anything .
The Pentagon paid for the expenses of the two DOD officials , and the American ambassador in Rome was fully briefed both before and after the meetings ,  Ledeen said .
What concerns intelligence officials is what appears to be manipulation of the press and strategic leaks to the public of false information , undercutting professional intelligence analysis , similar to what occurred before the Iraq war in an apparent effort to bolster support for engaging Iran .

Route change called desperate , last - minute act THE OLYMPIC TORCH IN S.F .
On Wednesday April 9 , 2008 in San Francisco , Calif Photo By Kurt Rogers / San Francisco Chronicle On Wednesday April 9 , 2008 in San Francisco , Calif Photo By Kurt Rogers / San Francisco Chronicle Photo : Kurt Rogers Photo : Kurt Rogers Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Route change called desperate , last - minute act 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
San Francisco officials spent months preparing for the arrival of the Olympic torch , but their decision Wednesday to cut the route short and drastically alter the torchbearers ' path was an act of desperation just before opening ceremonies kicked off , sources said .
The move to scrap the city 's highly publicized plans for runners to carry the torch from AT&T Park and along the city 's scenic waterfront infuriated many protesters and torch supporters who waited for hours to spread their anti-China message or to catch a glimpse of the Olympic flame .
But Mayor Gavin Newsom said he and Police Chief Heather Fong decided to change the route after realizing that police officers stationed along the designated path - especially near the ballpark and the Ferry Building , the relay 's original start and finish - were overwhelmed by the size of the crowds and by skirmishes between torch supporters and protesters .
Newsom administration officials said the large group of pro-Tibet protesters marching in advance of the opening ceremony along the Embarcadero toward the ballpark was another reason for altering the route .
" We could not guarantee safety to all parties to the degree we had hoped , " Newsom said .
Even with 700 San Francisco police officers and an unknown number of other public safety agencies on hand , law enforcement officials said they could not secure entire blocks of barricades along the initial 6 - mile - long route .
Police cited three people for resisting arrest .
Newsom said he and Fong decided to alter the route at 11 a.m. , after he met with torchbearers gathered at the Hilton Hotel - then changed the route again shortly before the 1 p.m. ceremony when they realized that huge numbers of protesters were gathering .
The mayor said the route that officials decided to use was one that he and Fong drew up on the fly , in part because a previous Olympic torch run through San Francisco had successfully passed through the Marina district .
Newsom boarded two buses filled with torchbearers and delivered the news to them .
Torchbearer Dean Karnazes said he and his fellow bearers did not know about the route change until 12:40 p.m.
Wednesday , when Newsom boarded the buses and told of the change in plans .
" This was the first we knew about it , " Karnazes said .
He added that in a briefing for the runners Tuesday afternoon , the mayor had warned them that the route could change and that the city might make that change for the sake of the runners ' safety .
" What we did was by no stretch of the imagination what we initially intended , but we fulfilled everyone 's rights , " Newsom said .
Sheriff Michael Hennessey , who provided 50 deputies for the event , said " 10,000 people are disappointed " as a result of moving the torch route , but millions of others are happy .
Hennessey said he was not involved in route - planning meetings and did not know the route would be changed until the decision was made .
" The planning was kept very close to the vest , " he said .
" I had troops on the ground , and I did n't know .
They took direction from the Police Department .
" I would n't call it a stroke of genius , I would call it a stroke of logic , " Hennessey added .
" I think it was a well - executed plan that provided for the world to see it at a safe event and allowed the world to see the torch and it to be viewed safely . "
One City Hall source familiar with police operations disputed officials ' assertion that the decision to change the route was a last - minute one and said law enforcement brass actually knew hours before the relay began that the route would change .
Hours before the opening ceremony 's kickoff , there were no police barricades set up along the Embarcadero in an area near Fisherman 's
Wharf , even though city officials had advertised that area as included in the main relay route .
Hundreds of spectators gathered along the sidewalks , where uniformed police officers told the crowd to stay back .
And elsewhere along the route , spectators were allowed to mill about in the streets even though police had said early in the day that they would arrest anyone who attempted to cross barricades .
At 3 pm on Wednesday , 16th April , the mutilated body of 15 year old Hammad Nidar Khadatbh was found in lands of the illegal Israeli settlement of Al - Hamra by his father , who was out searching for his missing son .
Hammad had left the house at 9 am on Tuesday , 15th April to work on the family ’s land , located near the stolen agricultural lands of the settlement .
As the second eldest son , he was picking cucumbers for the family rather than going to school , to help with the income of his struggling family .
At evening he failed to return home , and so his father and other family members immediately went searching for him .
They found nothing .
They set out again the next day , Wednesday , and found his body in a place they had searched the day before – clearly dumped overnight .
Hammad ’s body was naked , bloated , and tortured .
His neck was broken , and his face had been smashed in with rocks .
One finger had been cut off and there were multiple holes in his torso , seemingly made by a sharp , round implement – something like a pen , his family explained .
An Israeli police officer who arrived on the scene to investigate the incident confirmed that Hammad had been murdered , but made no comment as to by whom .
Hammad ’s body was immediately taken to the coroner in Jerusalem , but the report on the exact cause of his death will not be available for another week .
After speaking to many people in the area , it was established that Hammad had tried to return home via the Al - Hamra ( Arabic for “ red area ” ) checkpoint , but was refused passage through as being only 15 years old , he had no identification ( IDs are only issued to Palestinians aged 16 years and over ) .
It appears that Hammad was then forced to walk around the long way home , and was taken at this point on Tuesday night .
Given the location of the body – on settlement lands and near an Israeli - only apartheid road – the family are convinced that Hammad was killed by settlers from the Al - Hamra settlement .
His father explained that his son was only a young boy , and had no enemies .
Also , he explained , there are no Palestinians in that area , only settlers from the agricultural settlement .
The 11500 residents of the village of Beit Furiq , located near the northern West Bank city of Nablus , have regular problems with the illegal settlements near their village .
Approximately three years ago a 78 year old man , Mohammad Abu Oday , was killed when settlers from Itamar settlement destroyed his head with large rocks .
Another young man was also shot dead by settlers , and five others have been injured whilst attempting to pick their olives .
Residents advise that these attacks happen when Palestinians go to lands that are anywhere near to settlements , occurring every couple of years .
Interestingly , these attacks elicit no repercussions on the settlers by the Israeli military such as are inflicted upon Palestinian villages in similar , or even lesser situations .
The village of Beita , for example , was shut down for four days last week , with massive roadblocks installed on every road to the village , and residents arrested for attempting to leave after a shooting occurred near an Israeli - only road in which no one was injured .
Hammad was buried at 3 pm on Thursday 17th April , and is survived by his parents and seven siblings .
We finally have some actual information about the “ liquid bomb ” that was planned by that London group arrested in 2006 :
The court heard the bombers intended to use hydrogen peroxide and mix it with a product called Tang , used in soft drinks , to turn it into an explosive .
They intended to carry it on board disguised as 500 ml bottles of Oasis or Lucozade by using food dye to recreate the drinks ’ distinctive colour .
The detonator would have been disguised as AA 1.5 batteries .
The contents of the batteries would have been removed and an electric element such as a lightbulb or wiring would have been inserted .
A disposable camera would have provided a power source .
Database management systems ( DBMS ) are 20 years out of date and should be completely rewritten to reflect modern use of computers .
That 's according to a group of academics including DBMS pioneer Mike Stonebraker , Ingres founder and a Postgres architect taking his second controversial outing so far this year .
Stonebraker upset many last month for his criticism of Google 's MapReduce .
In a paper entitled The end of an architectural era ( It 's time for a complete rewrite ) , the group - drawn from DBMS specialists at MIT and in industry - have said that modern use of computers renders many features of mainstream DBMS obsolete .
They have argued that DBMS designs such as Oracle and SQL Server come from an age when online transaction processing ( OLTP ) dominated and required techniques such as multi threading and transaction locking .
They said that modern transactions - entered via web pages - do not need these expensive processing overheads and DBMS should , therefore , be re-designed without them .
Persistent storage such as disks are also seen as unnecessary and could be replaced by geographically dispersed RAM storage .
Stonebraker and his group also advocate abandoning SQL because they see no need for a separate data manipulation language .
Data manipulation , they said , can be performed with other tasks using languages such as Ruby .
They describe a prototype DBMS called H - Store that embodies these ideas .
While there is certainly a point to be made about the way OLTP works in modern computer environments and the group has some persuasive arguments , it seems unlikely that mainstream DBMS builders will move away from tried - and - tested TP technologies in the near future .
Banks and financial institutions in particular will want to hang on to the comfort and security provided by DBMS , which fully implement ACID properties . ®
Two years ago the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation expected biofuels to help eradicate hunger and poverty for up to two billion people .
Yesterday the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon raised real doubt over that policy amid signs that the world was facing its worst food crisis in a generation .
Since the FAO 's report in April 2006 tens of thousands of farmers have switched from food to fuel production to reduce US dependence on foreign oil .
Spurred by generous subsidies and an EU commitment to increase the use of biofuels to counter climate change , at least 8 m hectares ( 20 m acres ) of maize , wheat , soya and other crops which once provided animal feed and food have been taken out of production in the US .
In addition , large areas of Brazil , Argentina , Canada and eastern Europe are diverting sugar cane , palm oil and soybean crops to biofuels .
The result , exacerbated by energy price rises , speculation and shortages because of severe weather , has been big increases of all global food commodity prices .
Lester Brown , director of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington , said yesterday that land turned to biofuels in the US alone in the last two years would have fed nearly 250 million people with average grain needs .
" This year 18 % of all US grain production will go to biofuels .
In the last two years the US has diverted 60 m tonnes of food to fuel .
On the heels of seven years of consumption of world grains exceeding supply , this has put a great strain on the world 's grain supplies , " he said .
Robert Zoellick , president of the World Bank , said this week that prices of all staple food had risen 80 % in three years , and that 33 countries faced unrest because of the price rises .
Zoellick urged rich countries to give the UN's World Food programme $ 500 m for emergency aid .
The bank plans to increase lending for agricultural production in Africa from $ 420 m to $ 850 m a year in 2009 .
As the bank predicted rice price rises of 55 % in 2008 , violent protests against the cost of living hit Ivory Coast this week .
On Thursday President Laurent Gbagbo cancelled custom duties on imported staple foods and cut taxes on rice , sugar , milk , fish , flour and oils .
In Bangladesh , where families spend up to 70 % of income on food , more than 50,000 households are getting emergency food after rice price rises .
A government source said : " One reason is that the overall drop in food production because of biofuels has prevented food being exported . "
Many countries that switched from traditional crops to rice diets as urbanisation increased face serious shortages and have defied the IMF by increasing wages , lowering prices and banning exports .
China has put price controls on cooking oil , grain , meat , milk and eggs .
There have been protests in Guinea , Egypt , Morocco , Uzbekistan , Yemen , Burkina Faso , Mauritania , Niger , Uzbekistan , Senegal , Haiti , Bolivia and Indonesia .
In the last two months Vietnam , Cambodia , Egypt , India , the Philippines and Thailand have stopped crop exports or raised prices to more than $ 1,200 a tonne to discourage exports .
Yesterday Philippine leaders warned that people hoarding rice could face economic sabotage charges .
A moratorium is being considered on converting agricultural land for building housing or golf courses .
Fast - food outlets are being pressed to offer half - portions of rice .
Robert Zeigler , director - general of the International Rice Research Institute , said it could be months before the market got a clear sense of how high prices could go .
" The whole market could become paralysed .
Who 's going to sell rice at $ 750 a tonne when they think it 's going to hit $ 1,000 ? "
Josette Sheeran , director of the World Food Programme , said in Ethiopia this week : " The cost of our food has doubled in just the last nine months .
We are seeing more urban hunger than ever before .
Often we are seeing food on the shelves but people being unable to afford it . "
Urbanisation and world trade rules have encouraged the dumping of rice and other food on African countries , which now import up to 40 % of food .
Last month the UK's chief scientist and food expert , Professor John Beddington , said the prospect of food shortages over the next 20 years was so acute that politicians , scientists and farmers must tackle it immediately .
" Climate change is a real issue and is rightly being dealt with by major global investment .
However , I am concerned there is another major issue along a similar time - scale , an elephant in the room - that of food and energy security . "

JAMES MILES , CORRESPONDENT WITH THE ECONOMIST
Well it 's early evening here , and the old Tibetan quarter of Lhasa still is very much in the control of the ethnic Tibetans who have been rioting for the last several hours since midday .
The unrest began earlier this week
Some of them are still attacking Chinese properties , shops , restaurants , owned by ethnic Chinese .
Some of them are looting those shops , taking out the contents and throwing them on huge fires which they 've lit in the street .
Now I think the big question on everybody 's mind is what 's next ?
The troops for the time being are still standing there and we do n't know what 's holding them back .
It could be a political question , indecision in Beijing over how to handle this , because if they do move in there could be bloodshed and that could have implications for the holding of the Olympics .
WITNESS WHO WANTS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS
The street is pretty much in flames .
I saw a huge amount of military in the town .
It went crazy all of a sudden .
All the Chinese shops were put on fire by Tibetans .
Tanks in the street .
Tear gas .
I saw people being carried away on stretchers and ordinary Tibetans going crazy .
WITNESS WHO SAW VIOLENCE ON WEDNESDAY
We saw policemen , uniformed policemen , which were unusual - we had n't seen them in any of the temples in the days before but there were two of them at least there visible crackling into their radios .
As the monks ran down suddenly people , policemen just appeared almost as if out of nowhere and started beating , pulling and kicking them as they streamed down towards the main entrance of the temple .
JOHN , TOURIST
I just returned from Lhasa yesterday .
I was in Lhasa for about 6 days , and I had just arrived at the famed Sera Monastery to see the debating monks , when they suddenly stormed out of their ' debating courtyard ' and rushed for the entrance of the temple .
The Buddha Halls were immediately shut in our faces by security officials .
Members of our group saw monks being beaten and kicked by the security forces that swarmed all over the temple precincts .
The monks were forced to sit in rows , surrounded by a double - phalanx of riot cops , brandishing clubs .
Our group was ushered out of the temple , and as we headed back in the direction of central Lhasa , we passed incoming troop - carriers ferrying camouflaged army regulars , with other army units marching in on foot from close locations .
All roads leading in were closed off .
CANADIAN VISITOR WHO WANTS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS
I was in Tibet in the last week , and was also witness to the monks fleeing from Sera Monastery and being beaten by police .
Our group was denied access to the monastery , and we were told that all the tourist access has been cut off .
We were told not to take any photos by our Chinese guide , and there were police staring at us as we waited in our bus watching the monks trying to get out of the monastery .
Kripaluji Maharaj persists that you should be tearful when you ask God for His love .
Tearfully call out to God in whatever language is dear to you , but you have to shed tears .
With shedding tears there is one condition : do n't bring any worldly desire before God .
There are two kinds of desires : bhukti , mukti .
Material happiness of any kind up to Brahma ’s abode is called bhukti , and attaining God is called mukti , apavarg , kaivalya , mokch .
Throw both of them far away from you .
They are both like demonesses .
Leave anyone who is under their influence .
The more dangerous of these two is mukti .
So just cry and beg Him for His Divine vision and do n’t ask for the world .
Do n't have any pretence or deception .
However you are , go like that .
If you fake anything , then God will do a left about turn from you .
You will have to become like an innocent child .
You were all innocent at the beginning .
As you got older , your elders taught you all this contrived behavior in your own home so we could deceive others .
Now if you meet a Saint , you also apply your intellect there .
" Is this Saint a true Saint , just a devotee , or a faker ? "
What is the situation of that intellect that is determining this ?
You ca n’t even tolerate hearing one word from someone .
Someone said you are a donkey , a fool , lustful , angry , greedy , deluded .
Your heart starts burning just from some words .
Alright , so tell me , have you attained God realization ?
No .
So then you are still under the control of maya , right ?
Yes .
So then you are still lustful , angry , greedy , etc . Accept it !
You might say , " I 'm listening to what you are saying and I do n’t feel lustful , angry and greedy . "
But after you get up , if someone shoves you , " Hey ! ! ! "
From just one action , you go crazy , even though you have the human body ’s highest class of intellect .
For this reason , always regard yourself as lustful , angry , greedy , and deluded .
It is a fact we are like this .
So why do n’t we accept it ?
Why do n't we like it ?
So before God we have to become like a baby who is without artifice , hypocrisy , pretence and deceit and beg God for His love .
Whatever form is pleasing to you , imagine Him in that form .
Whatever name is pleasing to you , use that name .
Whatever virtues , leelas , decorations are pleasing to you , imagine those .
Do n't be scared .
Dress
Him in pants and pitch a ball to him , " Come on Shyamsundar !
Let ’s play cricket ! "
Just think , if Krishn were to descend today , would His mother and father dress
Him in a peetambar and send him to school ?
God has all the forms .
Sometimes
He becomes a woman , a young boy , a young girl or so old that He has to walk with a stick .
These are all His shringar .
Whatever style of decoration a mother and father find pleasing , that is how they are going to dress their child .
It has always been like this in every age .
But whatever you like , imagine Him dressed and decorated accordingly .
Do all this with your mind , because if you do external Deity worship , you will feel inadequate , " If I were a billionaire , I could decorate Shyamsundar with a $ 10 million diamond necklace . "
But you do n’t have money .
But why think like this ?
In the Bhagwatam , eight kinds of Deity worship are described .
One of these is manomay .
Do it from your mind wherever you are .
If you have to take a Deity from here to there and there to here – it ’s a problem .
And the Deity you imagine in your mind you could adorn with a $ 10 million diamond necklace .
Whatever clothing you like , whatever decorations you prefer – you can keep on changing and without spending any money .
This does n’t make any difference to God .
Solar energy will likely be the cheapest form of energy in the nearest future .
A Silicon Valley start - up known as Nanosolar shipped its first batch of solar panels which is priced at $ 1 per watt .
The company CEO , Martin Roscheisen was pictured reserving the first three commercially viable panels .
One of the panels would be on display at the company ’s headquarters , another was donated to the San Jose ’s Tech Museum of Innovation while the third was sold on eBay at a starting price of 99cents .
In 2014 , Nanosolar which produced the CIGS thin - film solar panel broke the hearts of many when its assets were auctioned off .
Cars were whizzing past one of Ojai ’s busiest corners when Jennifer Moss decided to do a headstand , clad in only a G - string and flower - shaped pasties .
Why ?
“ Headstands are good for you ! ” she said , beaming , as she pulled a yellow smiley - face pillow out of her bicycle ’s small trailer .
With athletic grace , Ojai ’s “ Pastie Lady , ” a self - described social artist and environmental activist , quickly pulled her legs up to salute her adopted hometown .
Not that this artsy , liberal - leaning city of 8,000 is all that impressed .
In the year since Moss began pedaling her bicycle down Ojai ’s main street in barely - there attire , she ’s been arrested twice and ticketed repeatedly for obstructing traffic .
Irate parents have asked the City Council to force Moss to put on more clothes .
Now she may face prosecution for public indecency .
“ The issue we ’re looking at is exposure , ” said Jim Ellison , Ventura County ’s chief assistant district attorney .
“ We ’ve assigned an attorney to do some research . ”
Ojai ’s citizens , meanwhile , have divided into pro- and con-Pastie Lady camps , venting their opinions in the local newspaper nearly every week .
“ Ojai tolerance is not eternal , ” local filmmaker Leland Hammerschmitt wrote in a guest editorial in the Ojai Valley News , in which he scolded Moss for her “ naked narcissism . ”
“ You ’ve had more than your day .
Go away .
Just stop . ”
But Moss , whose social activism appears to revolve around natural - fiber clothing and the healing powers of water , also has ardent defenders .
They say “ Earth Friend Jen ” is not hurting anyone and that naysayers should leave her alone .
“ In the South , they actually embrace you if you are eccentric or even a little crazy .
. . . , ” Dusty Fernandez , an Oak View resident , wrote in the paper .
“ So lighten up people !
Enjoy the view or turn the other way . ”
The petite , raven - haired woman at the center of the tempest takes it all in stride .
Moss , 32 , said she has grown used to people ’s strong reactions to her activism .
“ Nudity is natural , but a lot of people are uncomfortable with it , ” she said rapidly .
“ It ’s OK for children to play video games where they are killing each other , and it ’s patriotic to murder people in a war .
But women ’s breasts in public ?
You better watch out ! ”
Moss is quick to say that her scant covering remains within the law .
She says she always wears pasties and a G - string ( made of hemp ) .
She contends that the tickets and arrests are a violation of her constitutional rights .
“ They are charging me with putting on an illegal performance or show , ” she said of her latest legal entanglement .
“ I stripped my clothes to speak the truth , but I was legally covered . ”
Moss may face a misdemeanor charge for taking off her clothes , down to pasties and G - string , outside the city ’s Catholic church on Easter Sunday , as parishioners were leaving morning Mass .
“ She took that opportunity to make her statement , and she appeared nude to most people , ” said Ojai Police Chief Bruce Norris .
“ We got several calls . ”
Sheriff ’s deputies arrested Moss on suspicion of violating a county ordinance that prohibits exposure of the nipples or genital area in a public place , Norris said .
Officers also confiscated a small video camera that her companions were using to record the event .
Moss now says that going to the church was “ poor judgment on my behalf . ”
She chose Easter Mass , she said , because “ there are so many bad people who are hurting and destroying the Earth , and many of them are religious people . ”
Police arrested Moss on a similar charge once before , Norris said , but the district attorney ’s office decided not to prosecute .
Even if prosecutors again fail to move , Norris thinks they will do so at some point .
“ People make complaints because they find her behavior extremely offensive , ” he said .
“ There is a potential to prosecute her eventually for a public nuisance . ”
The police chief insists that his main concern is safety .
Moss is an athletic woman who moves very fast on her bike or on in - line skates down Ojai Avenue , the city ’s main thoroughfare .
Norris said he ’s worried that Moss might be injured in an accident .
“ She ’s in great shape .
I admire her for that , ” he said .
“ But I ’m afraid something is going to happen to her . ”
Originally from a small town near Corvallis , Ore. , Moss gravitated toward Southern California in her 20s .
Her upbringing was too restrictive for her taste , she said , and she wanted to explore her spirituality in a place that would be less judgmental .
She landed first in Venice Beach before making her way to Santa Barbara , holding small jobs along the way .
The first time she donned her skimpy bike - wear was in Santa Barbara , where the cops promptly stopped her .
“ They were very mean to me , ” she said .
“ They treated me like I ’m insane . ”
Moss moved on to Ojai , working for a time as a waitress at a vegan restaurant in Ventura .
For most city residents , last year ’s Fourth of July parade was her public debut .
Jaws dropped as she whizzed past startled paradegoers on in - line skates , wearing not all that much more than suntan oil .
Now , several times a week , she pedals down Ojai Avenue on her bike , hauling her trailer full of signs advocating her various causes .
On a recent day , she was greeted by many honks of support and a few whistles .
“ We love you , Pastie Lady ! ” screamed a gaggle of teenage girls in a passing Suburban .
But as Moss passed a bus stop , a woman sitting with several children yelled , “ You ’re a nut ! ”
Earth Friend Jen gave her usual response : “ I love you !
You do n’t have to be like that ! ”
Two middle - aged guys watched her speed past downtown and shook their heads .
“ She ’s got a great body , ” said one of the men .
“ But she ’s crazy as a loon . ”
“ She ’s a character , ” said his buddy , “ but she ’s part of Ojai . ”

AXIOM OF CHOICE
-- an introduction and links collection by
Eric Schechter , Vanderbilt University
The Axiom of Choice ( AC ) was formulated about a century ago , and it was controversial for a few of decades after that ; it might be considered the last great controversy of mathematics .
It is now a basic assumption used in many parts of mathematics .
In fact , assuming AC is equivalent to assuming any of these principles ( and many others ) :
Given any two sets , one set has cardinality less than or equal to that of the other set -- i.e. , one set is in one - to - one correspondence with some subset of the other .
( Historical remark :
It was questions like this that led to Zermelo 's formulation of AC . )
It was questions like this that led to Zermelo 's formulation of AC . )
Any vector space over a field F has a basis -- i.e. , a maximal linearly independent subset -- over that field .
( Remark :
If we only consider the case where F is the real line , we obtain a slightly weaker statement ; it is not yet known whether this statement is also equivalent to AC . )
If we only consider the case where F is the real line , we obtain a slightly weaker statement ; it is not yet known whether this statement is also equivalent to AC . )
Any product of compact topological spaces is compact .
( This is now known as Tychonoff 's Theorem , though Tychonoff himself only had in mind a much more specialized result that is not equivalent to the Axiom of Choice . )
AC has many forms ; here is one of the simplest :
Axiom of Choice .
Let C be a collection of nonempty sets .
Then we can choose a member from each set in that collection .
In other words , there exists a function f defined on C with the property that , for each set S in the collection , f( S ) is a member of S .
The function f is then called a choice function .
To understand this axiom better , let 's consider a few examples .
If C is the collection of all nonempty subsets of { 1,2,3 , ...} , then we can define f quite easily : just let f ( S ) be the smallest member of S .
is the collection of all nonempty subsets of { 1,2,3 , ...} , then we can define quite easily : just let ( ) be the smallest member of .
If C is the collection of all intervals of real numbers with positive , finite lengths , then we can define f ( S ) to be the midpoint of the interval S .
is the collection of all intervals of real numbers with positive , finite lengths , then we can define ( ) to be the midpoint of the interval .
If C is some more general collection of subsets of the real line , we may be able to define f by using a more complicated rule .
is some more general collection of subsets of the real line , we may be able to define by using a more complicated rule .
However , if C is the collection of all nonempty subsets of the real line , it is not clear how to find a suitable function f .
In fact , no one has ever found a suitable function f for this collection C , and there are convincing model - theortic arguments that no one ever will .
( Of course , to prove this requires a precise definition of " find , " etc . )
If we follow the constructivists , and " exist " means " find , " then the axiom is false , since we cannot find a choice function for the nonempty subsets of the reals .
, since we cannot find a choice function for the nonempty subsets of the reals .
However , most mathematicians give " exists " a much weaker meaning , and they consider the Axiom to be true : To define f( S ) , just arbitrarily " pick any member " of S .
To assert that a mathematical object " exists , " even when you cannot give an example of it , is a little bit like this :
Suppose that one day you go to a football game by yourself .
There are thousands of other people in the stadium , but you do n't know the names of any of them .
( And let 's suppose you 're shy , so you 're not about to ask anyone their name . )
Then you know those people have names , but you cannot give any of those names .
( Admittedly , this is only a metaphor , and not a perfect one ; do n't make too much of it . )
The " existence " of f -- or of any mathematical object , even the number " 3 " -- is purely formal .
It does not have the same kind of solidity as your table and your chair ; it merely exists in the mental universe of mathematics .
Many different mathematical universes are possible .
When we accept or reject the Axiom of Choice , we are specifying something about which mental universe we 're choosing to work in .
Both possibilities are feasible -- i.e. , neither accepting nor rejecting AC yields a contradiction ; that fact follows from models devised by Gödel and Cohen .
However , most " ordinary " mathematicians -- i.e. , most mathematicians who are not logicians or set theorists -- accept the Axiom of Choice chiefly because their work is simpler with the Axiom of Choice than without it .
Bertrand Russell was more famous for his work in philosophy and political activism , but he was also an accomplished mathematician .
His book Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy includes some discussion of AC .
Here is my paraphrasing of part of what he said :
To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice , but for shoes the Axiom is not needed .
Jerry Bona once said ,
The Axiom of Choice is obviously true ; the Well Ordering Principle is obviously false ; and who can tell about Zorn 's Lemma ?
For another indication of the controversy that initially surrounded the Axiom of Choice , consider this anecdote ( recounted by Jan Mycielski in Notices of the AMS vol. 53 no. 2 page 209 ) .
Tarski , one of the early great researchers in set theory and logic , proved that AC is equivalent to the statement that any infinite set X has the same cardinality as the Cartesian product X x X .
He submitted his article to Comptes Rendus Acad .
Sci. Paris , where it was refereed by two very famous mathematicians , Fréchet and Lebesgue .
Both wrote letters rejecting the article .
Fréchet wrote that an implication between two well known truths is not a new result .
And Lebesgue wrote that an implication between two false statements is of no interest .
Tarski said that he never again submitted a paper to the Comptes Rendus .
AC permits arbitrary choices from an arbitrary collection of nonempty sets .
Some mathematicians have investigated some weakened forms of AC , such as
CC ( Countable Choice ) , which permits arbitrary choices from a sequence of nonempty sets .
DC ( Dependent Choice ) , which permits the more general process of selecting arbitrarily from a sequence of nonempty sets where only the first set is specified in advance ; each subsequent set of options may depend somehow on the previous choices .
This is precisely what is needed for some choice processes in topology and analysis -- e.g. , for the proof of the Baire Category Theorem .
The full strength of the Axiom of Choice does not seem to be needed for applied mathematics .
Some weaker principle such as CC or DC generally would suffice .
To see this , consider that any application is based on measurements , but humans can only make finitely many measurements .
We can extrapolate and take limits , but usually those limits are sequential , so even in theory we cannot make use of more than countably many measurements .
The resulting spaces are separable .
Even if we use a nonseparable space such as L∞ , this may be merely to simplify our notation ; the relevant action may all be happening in some separable subspace , which we could identify with just a bit more effort .
( Thus , in some sense , nonseparable spaces exist only in the imagination of mathematicians . )
If we restrict our attention to separable spaces , then much of conventional analysis still works with AC replaced by CC or DC .
However , the resulting exposition is then more complicated , and so this route is only followed by a few mathematicians who have strong philosophical leanings against AC .
A few pure mathematicians and many applied mathematicians ( including , e.g. , some mathematical physicists ) are uncomfortable with the Axiom of Choice .
Although AC simplifies some parts of mathematics , it also yields some results that are unrelated to , or perhaps even contrary to , everyday " ordinary " experience ; it implies the existence of some rather bizarre , counterintuitive objects .
Perhaps the most bizarre is the Banach - Tarski Paradox :
It is possible to take the 3 - dimensional closed unit ball ,
B = { ( x , y, z ) ∈ R3 : x2 + y2 + z2 < 1 }
At first glance , the Banach - Tarski result seems to contradict some of our intuition about physics -- e.g. , the Law of Conservation of Mass , from classical Newtonian physics .
If we assume that the ball has a uniform density , then the Banach - Tarski Paradox seems to say that we can disassemble a one - kilogram ball into pieces and rearrange them to get two one - kilogram balls .
But actually , the contradiction can be explained away :
Only a set with a defined volume can have a defined mass .
A " volume " can be defined for many subsets of R3 --- spheres , cubes , cones , icosahedrons , etc. --- and in fact a " volume " can be defined for nearly any subset of R3 that we can think of .
This leads beginners to expect that the notion of " volume " is applicable to every subset of R3 .
But it 's not .
In particular , the pieces in the Banach - Tarski decomposition are sets whose volumes cannot be defined .
More precisely , Lebesgue measure is defined on some subsets of R3 , but it cannot be extended to all subsets of R3 in a fashion that preserves two of its most important properties : the measure of the union of two disjoint sets is the sum of their measures , and measure is unchanged under translation and rotation .
The pieces in the Banach - Tarski decomposition are not Lebesgue measurable .
Thus , the Banach - Tarski Paradox gives as a corollary the fact that there exist sets that are not Lebesgue measurable .
That corollary also has a much shorter proof ( not involving the Banach - Tarski Paradox ) which can be found in every introductory textbook on measure theory , but it too uses the Axiom of Choice .
Here is a brief sketch of that shorter proof :
Work in " the real numbers modulo 1 " -- that is , the number system that you get if you cut the interval [ 0,1 ) out of the real line and loop it around into a circle , so that 0 and 1 are the same number .
( Like the way that 0 and 12 are the same on a circular clock . )
In that number system , multiplication and division do n't really work very well any more , but addition and subtraction still work fine , and so does Lebesgue measure .
Let 's call that number system T ; its entire measure is 1 .
Now , the Axiom of Choice is used to " construct " a rather peculiar subset of T -- let us call it C -- with the property that the sets C+r = {x+r : x in C} are all disjoint from each other , for different values of the rational number r.
The union of these sets is all of T .
Now , if C were measurable , then so would each C+r , and they would all have the same measure , and their measures would add up to the measure of T -- that is , they would add up to 1 .
But how many of these C+r are there ?
There are a countable infinity of them .
If the measure of C were zero , their sum would be zero .
If the measure of C were positive , their sum would be infinite .
You can't get 1 , either way .
Personally , I am not surprised to find the Axiom of Choice coming into play in a subject that is so inherently complicated as unmeasurable sets .
I am much more surprised to find AC coming into play in this simpler and more concrete example : I want to classify all subsets of { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , . . .} as " small " or not " small , " defining the word " small " in such a way that
any set with zero or one members is " small " ; any union of two " small " sets is " small " ; and a set is " small " if and only if its complement is n't " small . "
Define " small " to mean " finite . "
This satisfies rules a and b .
But it does not satisfy rule c , since the even numbers and the odd numbers are complements of each other , and neither of those sets is finite .
Say that a set is " small " if the number 1 is not a member of that set .
This definition satisfies rules b and c , but it classifies the set { 1} as " not small , " thus failing rule a .
Say that a set is " small " if it contains at most one of the three numbers 1 , 2 , 3 .
That satisfies rules a and c .
But it classifies the sets { 1} and { 2} as small and the set { 1,2} as not small , thus failing rule b .
Technical details for experts :
To prove the existence of such a classification scheme , just call " large " the members of some nonprincipal ultrafilter on the positive integers , and call their complements " small . "
Note that , with this scheme , any superset of a " large " set is also " large . "
The converse is slightly more complicated :
If you have a " small / large " classification , the " large " sets do not necessarily necessarily form a nonprincipal ultrafilter , but the supersets of " large " sets do .
An introduction to nonprincipal ultrafilters can be found in my book and in many other places in the literature .
The existence of nonprincipal ultrafilters follows easily from Zorn 's Lemma , by arguments that will be obvious once you 've digested all definitions involved ( admittedly not a small task ) .
But showing that the existence proof is inherently nonconstructive is much harder , and requires some definitions that I 've made up .
By an " example " I mean anything whose existence can be proved using just ZF +DC --- that is , I 'll allow Dependent Choice but no higher relatives of AC .
Let BP be the statement that " every subset of the reals has the Baire property . "
The existence of a nonpricipal ultrafilter on the integers implies not -BP ( by fairly straightforward functional analysis and topology ) .
But in 1984 Shelah proved that the consistency of ZF implies the consistency of ZF + DC + BP .
Therefore , if ordinary set theory is free of contradictions , then ZF + DC can not be used to prove not - BP .
I say " if " because we do n't know that for sure , and Gödel 's Incompleteness
Theorem assures us that we never will know the consistency of ZF for sure .
However , I would say that ZF is empirically consistent :
In a century of study , mathematicians have not yet found any contradictions in ZF , despite the incentive that any mathematician finding such an important proof would instantly be promoted to full professor at any university in the world .
My example with positive integers might appear to be simpler than the Banach - Tarski Paradox , but it does not really get us completely away from measure theory .
A nonprincipal ultrafilter can be reformulated as a two - valued probability measure that is finitely additive but not countably additive .
In the preceding paragraphs I have attempted to introduce the Axiom of Choice in the language of informal set theory ( also known as " naive set theory " ) , in which one assumes that sets are " collections of objects , " with the meanings of the words " collection " and " object " based on our everyday nonmathematical experience .
However , this web page is merely an introduction to the subject , and gives no indication of the proofs .
A mathematically precise study of AC would require formal set theory ( also known as " axiomatic set theory " ) ; that is the language spoken by the real experts in this subject .
In formal set theory , we put aside any nonmathematical , notions of " set " .
Instead of working with imagined sets , we work with sentences about some objects that we call " sets . "
We begin with a list of axioms , i.e. , properties that these abstract objects are assumed to satisfy .
Generally we assume axioms that seem intuitively reasonable , but we assume as few axioms as possible -- we try to choose axioms that enable us to prove the other properties that we want .
We assume nothing else beyond what is contained in those axioms ; we may not use a property of sets just because it is " familiar " or " obvious . "
Then we study the nature of the proofs , to determine what kinds of things can or cannot be proved .
The axiomatic approach is much drier , and less appealing to all but a few specialists who are interested in it ; but its conclusions are much more reliable than any mere , informal discussion .
In this web page I have attempted to summarize , in informal language , some of the conclusions that are reached by that formal theory .

Officials from Flight Global stated that DARPA will probably sign a contract to create an unmanned aircraft that is able to stay in the air for about 5 years at a time .
The representatives from DARPA characterize their project , entitled " Vulture , " as a " persistent pseudo - satellite capability in an aircraft package . "
Generally speaking the aircraft is able to fly over a single area , communicating or performing analysis for years at a time .
Having such grand goals the company has to overcome some serious barriers .
One of the major obstacles is linked with the fact that designers have to figure out the way to supply power to such an aircraft during the long missions .
In addition it is worth mentioning that the aircraft will carry a 1000 pound ( 450 kg ) payload in terrible winds at an altitude of 60,000 to 90,000 feet .
In regard to the design of the aircraft , it will probably be the one seen in the picture , developed by NASA , however , there is no certain time table on when the craft will actually be ready .
US Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency looks forward to push the limits of unmanned aviation to extremes .
The latest UAV project of DARPA currently raises eyebrows .
" We want to completely change the paradigm of how we think of aircraft , " stated Daniel Newman , who holds the post of Vulture project manager .
" Aviation has a perfect record - we 've never left one up there .
We will attempt to break that record , " he added .
" The ability to " close the business case " on an aircraft that could be launched and then not maintained or brought home for five years would be a " paradigm shift .
We would no longer define an aircraft by the launch - recover - maintain - launch cycle , " outlined Newman .
Besides problems with providing power to the craft , engineers are working on maximizing aero-structural efficiency and avoiding the deterioration of materials during their long - time exposure to stratospheric flight .
Basically the aircraft operates like a satellite , which is , however , not regulated by orbital mechanics .
" It could be positioned over the battle , at 65,000 ft versus 260 miles , " outlined DARPA 's Wade Pulliam .
According to Pulliam , the Vulture is a pseudo - satellite , the operation of which in the stratosphere and not in the low Earth orbit would give a 65 dB upgrading in communications capability and considerably increase onboard sensor resolution .
Technology has come a long way in the past few decades and the advances do n't appear to be slowing down anytime soon .
From laptops and cellphones to the advent of Internet communications , we are moving toward a brave new world of possibilities .
Even buying a new computer is tricky , since it'll probably be outdated by the time you open the box !

Where do I keep my cash ?
During times of financial crisis ( like now ) , that 's the question on many investors ' minds .
And when the financial crisis involves the credit markets ( as it does now ) , the answer is n't so simple .
Keeping money in " cash " generally means putting it where it is guaranteed not to lose value and can be accessed quickly , with no fees or taxes .
As some investors have learned the hard way , not all investments touted as " cash - like " meet those requirements .
The first scare came in August , when it turned out that money - market funds , long thought to be super - safe , had been buying risky mortgage - backed bonds .
While no investors have lost money , fund sponsors , including trusted names like Janus ( JNS ) , Wells Fargo ( WFG ) , and Credit Suisse ( CS ) , have had to step in to prevent some funds from registering losses .
Close calls
Just how big a problem is it ?
In December , Janus took a $ 16.2 million charge when it bought such securities from its money - market portfolios .
" They would rather reach into their own pockets and take earnings losses than incur the wrath of investors by fouling up a liquid investment that is supposed to be fail - safe , " says Lipper senior analyst Jeff Tjornehoj .
The second near miss has come in the market for auction - rate securities - essentially long - term bonds that pay interest at a rate determined by periodic auctions .
Some individual investors put money into funds that bought auction - rate securities believing they were similar to money - market funds but with slightly higher yields .
However , the credit crunch has put a crimp in the market , and several auction - rate funds , including ones run by Nuveen and Eaton Vance ( EV ) , are frozen .
Investors are still earning interest , in some cases at extremely favorable rates , but they can't get their money out .
What to expect
So where does that leave nervous people with money at hand ?
There are still safe options , but remember that safety means lower yields .
" If you are getting more than a market rate on your cash , you are taking some risk , which is not cash investing , " says Madelynn Matlock , a director at Huntington Asset Advisors .
Or as Peter Crane , head of money - fund research firm Crane Data , says , " Cash is the money you need on hand , so safety and liquidity are your first concerns .
Yield comes after all of that . "
If you keep your assets in cash while the storm passes , stick with the classic menu of investment options .
That means Treasury bond money - market funds , high - yield savings accounts , and short - term CDs .
Those options seem plain , but they offer the safety and liquidity that defines true cash investments .
And take heart .
You can still find decent yields by shopping around , but you have to shop carefully .
Let 's start with the safest investments of all : short - term Treasury bills , or T - bills , which range in maturity from a few days to 26 weeks .
You can buy bills directly from the Treasury at treasurydirect.gov ; the minimum purchase is $ 1,000 .
( On Friday the Treasury Department announced that it would reduce that minimum to $ 100 as of April 7 , in order to open up the market to smaller investors . )
Money - market funds that invest only in short - term Treasury bills were yielding an average of 1.9 % recently , according to Crane Data .
They carry zero risk of default , and because they are short term , no risk that rising interest rates will reduce their value .
Considering money markets
Bank money - market accounts , insured for up to $ 100,000 by the FDIC , are another super - safe choice .
They recently yielded 3 % on average , according to bankrate.com .
But some are paying much more : Flagstar Bank in Troy , Mich. , is offering 4.18 % .
If you do n't mind locking up your money for a few months , bank CDs offer similar protection and , sometimes , higher yields .
Metropolitan National Bank in New York City is offering 3.46 % on a three - month , $ 2,500 CD , while Corus Bank in Chicago is paying 3.79 % on a six - month CD .
You can check bankrate.com to look for the best rates .
If you prefer money - market funds , keep in mind that they are not guaranteed to maintain their value .
Stick with companies known for low expenses and conservative management , and likely to stand behind their funds , such as Vanguard , Fidelity , and T. Rowe Price .
The average money fund yields 3.4 % , according to Lipper , and the average tax - exempt money fund yields 2.4 % - equivalent to 3.7 % for someone in the 35 % federal tax bracket .
Finally , remember that inflation - currently running at about a 4 % annual rate - erodes the value of cash holdings .
So do n't keep your money parked forever .
Says Matlock : " Once the market chaos clears , you can take advantage of opportunities you would have to miss if you were n't in a low - yield but secure and liquid investment now . "
ISO conducted a Ballot Resolution Meeting on Friday in an effort to address some of the technical issues that plague Microsoft 's Office Open XML ( OOXML ) document format .
Participants say that some very positive and meaningful changes were made to the OOXML specification , but many of the participants are frustrated with the large number of problems that did n't receive adequate attention as a result of time constraints .
ISO declined to grant OOXML immediate fast - track approval during a previous vote last year .
Companies and government agencies represented in ISO 's OOXML evaluation process have since generated thousands of comments , criticisms , and requests for clarification .
ISO passed these back to ECMA , which has worked with Microsoft to consolidate and review the concerns expressed by ISO participants , and finally issue responses .
The function of the Ballot Resolution Meeting ( BRM ) is to enable ISO participants to evaluate and vote on ECMA 's responses , many of which are technical recommendations aimed at resolving or addressing perceived deficiencies in the standard .
Unfortunately , the sheer volume of problems in the specification identified by ISO members has made the review process a significant challenge .
There were over 1,000 ECMA responses , spanning approximately 2,300 pages .
Participants say that only a small portion of the ECMA responses were actually discussed during the BRM .
When time ran out , the rest of the responses were simply approved without any review at all .
This was done out of necessity because the alternative would be to abandon the important technical recommendations made in the unreviewed ECMA responses .
The end result is that ISO members participating in the OOXML voting process were given very little opportunity to refine and expand on ECMA 's fixes for OOXML 's problems .
Although some individuals who have been involved in the process — even some in the ODF camp — have expressed strong support for ECMA 's efforts on OOXML , others — like Google and IBM — say that too many deficiencies still remain .
Some of the more vocal critics contend that the lack of time for adequate review of the ECMA responses is evidence that OOXML is n't an appropriate candidate for fast - track approval .
One such critic was one of Canada 's representatives at the BRM , Tim Bray — director of web technologies for Sun Microsystems ( which backs the competing OpenDocument format ) and one of the co-editors of W3 C 's XML specification .
" The process was complete , utter , unadulterated bullshit .
I 'm not an ISO expert , but whatever their ' Fast Track ' process was designed for , it sure was n't this .
You just can't revise six thousand pages of deeply complex specification - ware in the time that was provided for the process , " wrote Bray in a blog entry .
" As the time grew short there was some real heartbreak as we ran out of time to take up proposals ; some of them , in my opinion , things that would really have helped the quality of the draft . "
Microsoft's Brian Jones has a significantly more optimistic take on the outcome of the BRM , which he believes was largely successful .
" The meeting closed with clapping and cheering , folks were really happy about the improved proposals for the specification and it was a very positive experience for me personally , " Jones wrote in a blog entry .
" I 'm deeply impressed by the thoughtful consideration and strong commitment shown by the NB delegates to improve this specification and I want to thank them all .
It is clear that the process worked . "
Delegates now have 30 days to issue their final vote on OOXML fast - track approval .
In light of the numerous concerns and technical issues that have yet to be fully resolved , it is n't clear that Microsoft 's format will receive enough votes to get the three - fifths support required for fast - track approval .
The company has clearly worked hard with ECMA to address as many concerns as possible , but the complexity of the specification may mean that fast - track approval just is n't feasible at this point .

Proposal : Adding composability to WxHaskell March 16 , 2008
Introduction
Currently there is no type safe way to make composite widgets with wxHaskell .
We can compose two widgets and present them in a GUI .
However , we cannot ( type safely ) compose two widgets into a larger widget , that behaves similarly to ordinary wxHaskell widgets ( the Window w - kind ) .
The only solutions that I have found is the CustomControls example in wxHaskell repository and as explained in this mailinglist post .
Neither of them is type safe .
These examples use unsafe casting of attributes and unsafe casting of the composite widget .
Also as seen in the latter example , when widgets needs state they must be kept in a global hashtable , which results in more safety issues .
The hashtable is created using unsafePerformIO .
Composability is important for most ( maybe any ) programming abstraction , and thus we would also like it for wxHaskell .
Composability is also common in other GUI toolkit like AWT for Java .
In this post I will propose how we could add composability to wxHaskell .
The source code for this proposal can be found here Composite.hs , here ListExample.hs , and here IntEntryExample.hs .
In this post application programmer will refer to a person implementing a GUI application .
Library programmer will refer to a person implementing the wxHaskell library .
Goals
But before going into details , I will state which goals I think is important for composing widgets :
the composite should behave like an ordinary widget to the eyes of the application programmer be safe to use be easy to use simple implementation
The first goal means that the composite type should implement many ( if not all ) of those type classes that wxHaskell widgets normally implements .
As stated above , current ways of making composite widgets involves unsafe type casting .
This is of cause less than ideal .
We do not want this or similar risky code .
And lastly , we would of cause want composing to be as easy as possible .
Both for the application programmer and the wxHaskell library programmer .
How to compose widgets
In this section I will describe how the application programmer creates new composite widgets , rather than how the library programmer implements the composer functions , which will be shown in the next section .
We will show how to compose widgets using two examples .
We create new widgets using the compose function :
compose :: ( Panel ( ) -> IO ( Layout , super , user ) ) -> Window w ->
[ Prop ( Composite super user ) ] -> IO ( Composite super user )
which takes an IO action as input .
The action should return a Layout , a super - type , and a user - type .
The role of the super - type is to easily inherit some instances .
E.g. if the super - type is SingleListBox ( ) then we will inherit instances for Items , Selection , and Selecting .
The role of the user - type is to let the composite - widget programmer instantiate arbitrary classes .
We will see the use of super - type in the first example , and the user of user - type in the second example .
List - box example
We will create a composite widget containing a list and a button to delete elements in the list .
The button should only be enabled when some element is selected in the list .
First , the code for the list - box widget :
type MyList = Composite ( SingleListBox ( ) ) ( ) --
List with delete button myList :: Window w -> [ Prop MyList ] ->
IO MyList myList = compose $ \p -> do ls <- singleListBox p [ ] b <- button p [ text := " Delete item " , on command := do s <- get ls selection when ( s /= ( - 1 ) ) ( itemDelete ls s ) , enabled := False ] set ls [ on mouse := \_ -> do s <- get ls selection set b [ enabled := ( s /= ( - 1 ) ) ] putStrLn " Mouse event " propagateEvent ] return ( row 10 [ widget ls , widget b ] , ls , ( ) )
as can be seen this code resembles ordinary wxHaskell code , except for the compose function .
Thus , it should be easy for the wxHaskell application programmer to get started .
Next the code to use our new widget :
main :: IO ( ) main = start $ do w <- frame [ ] -- here we use the new MyList widget ls <- myList w [ text := " My list " , items := map show [ 1..7 ] , fontSize := 18 , on select := print " Some item selected ... " ] enableB <- button w [ text := " Outer enable " , on command := do set ls [ enabled := True ] ] disableB <- button w [ text := " Outer disable " , on command := do set ls [ enabled := False ] ] set w [ layout := row 10 [ widget ls , widget enableB , widget disableB ] ]
the main function creates a MyList and two buttons which can enable and disable the widget .
Again this resembles ordinary wxHaskell code .
The reader should note , that we do the right thing with respect to enabledness .
If we hit the enable - button MyList ’s delete button is only enabled if some item is selected .
That is , the widget do not just blindly enable all of it ’s child widgets .
Integer entry
This example will create a text entry specialised for integer values .
This time we will not inherit the instances of a super - type but implement our own .
-- Text entry for integers type IntEntry = Composite () ( IO Int , Int -> IO ( ) ) intEntry :: Window w -> [ Prop IntEntry ] ->
IO IntEntry intEntry = compose $ \p -> do intEn <- textEntry p [ processEnter := True , on any Key := handleInput , text := " 0 " ] let getter = do val <- get intEn text readIO val setter x = set intEn [ text := show x ] return ( widget intEn , ( ) , ( getter , setter ) ) where handleInput ( KeyChar c ) = do if c `elem` [ '0 '..' 9 '] then propagateEvent else return ( ) handleInput _ = propagateEvent class IntValue a where intValue :: Attr a Int instance IntValue IntEntry where intValue = newAttr " Int attribute " getter setter where getter composite = fst ( pickUser composite ) setter composite = snd ( pickUser composite )
as can be seen we made a new class for integer valued widgets .
Our new composite widget implements this type .
Here is the full code for IntEntry .
Inherited instances
Regardless of using a super - type or not these instances :
Widget
Able
Bordered
Child
Dimensions
Identity
Literate
Visible
Reactive ( event class )
are always inherited .
This also means that we cannot specialise these instances for a particular widget .
But behavior for these classes should be similar for all widgets .
Thus , there is no need to specialise them .
If the super - type implements any of :
Items
Selection
Selections
Textual
Commanding ( event class )
Selecting ( event class )
then so will the composite widget .
Those it is possible to automatically inherit most of the ordinary wxHaskell instances .
Goals
The two examples show that we fulfil goal one though three , as the code resembles ordinary wxHaskell code , is fairly easy to use , and do not involve unsafe code .
Implementation of compose
We use a Composite type to contain the widgets .
It is defined as follows :
data Composite super user = Composite { pickPanel :: Panel ( ) , pickSuper :: super , pickUser :: user }
All of wxHaskell ’s widgets are of type ‘ forall w .
Window w’ , but the Composite type is not .
However , this is not problematic , as the Composite type will still look like an ordinary wxHaskell widget to the application programmer , due to implementing most of the ordinary wxHaskell type classes .
The most interesting piece is properly the compose function :
compose :: ( Panel ( ) -> IO ( Layout , super , user ) ) -> Window w ->
[ Prop ( Composite super user ) ] -> IO ( Composite super user ) compose f w props = do p <- panel w [ ] ( lay , super , user ) <- f p set p [ layout := container p lay ] let composite =
Composite p super user set composite props return composite
it simply creates a panel , sets the layout of the panel , and sets all properties .
One should note that no properties are set at widget creation time .
This may be problematic for functions like fullRepaintOnResize that requires to be set at creation time .
And now we can instantiate the ordinary Haskell classes :
-- Inherit from Panel ( ) - all composites will inherit these classes instance Widget ( Composite super user ) where widget w = widget ( pickPanel w ) instance Able ( Composite super user ) where enabled = mapFromPanel enabled ... --
Inherit from super instance Checkable super =>
Checkable ( Composite super user ) where checkable = mapFromSuper checkable checked = mapFromSuper checked ...
We have not shown all the instantiated classes .
However , these can be found at the accompanying source code .
The complete implementation ( with comments ) is 208 lines , where most of it is boilerplate class instantiations .
While I would like it shorter , it is not overly long and the structure is fairly simple .
Conclusion
As shown the proposal lives up to the goals stated in the beginning :
the composite should behave like an ordinary widget to the eyes of the application programmer be safe to use be easy to use simple implementation
One problem with this proposal is that a small number of wxHaskell functions must be called at widget creation time .
We might be able to alleviate this with type - safe casts .
But this will have to wait for a future posts .
Another issue could be that Composite is not of type ‘ forall w . Window w’ .
However , I do not see any real problem with this , but would very much like comments from people who do .
Feel free to discuss this proposal .
Any improvements , critique , questions , or other comments will be most welcome .
There are many reasons to simulate traditional processes , rather than actually print with the traditional process itself .
Firstly , not everyone has access to the materials required for many of the processes , and many alternative processes use chemicals that can be quite unpleasant to work with and at times unsafe .
Of course it 's often quite possible to work safely with most of the chemicals involved in most alternative processes , however this can be a concern for many people .
Further , it can take significant time to develop the skills required to make high quality prints with alternative processes - there are 6 month fill time courses on alternative processes on offer , it is not exactly something you can master in a few hours .
Good digital technique takes just as long to develop as good analogue technique , but I would presume that most of the people reading this article are already quite good with digital imaging and comfortable with the use of ICC profiles .
Use of these techniques allows you to :
The idea is grand in scope , but his personal taste in design leaves something to be desired , at least in my opinion .
I would love to try this with a stained glass window design , or even a Celtic knot .

There will be a keynote talk by Marco Antoniotti ( Dipartimento di Informatica Sistemistica e Comunicazione , Università degli Studi di Milano - Bicocca , Italy ) at the main track of the symposium :
The right mix : Common Lisp in Bioinformatics , Systems Biology and in the Larger Semantic Network World
Working with CL nowadays is a choice based on a long programming experience ( and / or lazyness and or / inertia ) .
Many times this choice is hard because of a number of entrenched limitations of the CL ( or simply Lispy ) world : lack of many agreed upon , modern and portable extensions , and lack of new programmers being the most visible .
Yet , this talk will argue that the situation has improved and that CL is even more " the right mix " for many researchers in the sciences , and , in particular , in the fields I have been working for a few years .
For CL , being the right mix comes from the strenghts of the standard and of the nature itself of the language .
The ability to build code with more than decent numerical performance and the ability to morph in any ( declarative ) DSL are the key characteristics that make CL the right tool for many of the sciences .
Bioinformatics and Systems Biology are two relatively broad terms that serve to describe a number of system and algorithmic solutions to problems stemming from the needs of biologists and clinicians .
Very roughly speaking , these terms cover the range from " sequence analysis " ( DNA , RNA , and protein ) to statistical interpretation of " high throughput experiments " ( micro- array and new ion- trap protein studies ) , to model simulation and testing of metabolic , regulatory and signaling pathways .
The numerical capabilities of CL do fit well with these problems .
On the other end , these problems require the support of many data manipulation , sharing and , above all , description systems that nowadays are continuously crystallized in different " ontologies " and " controlled vocabularies " which are then rendered in XML / RDF .
CL systems for solving such " representation " task predate all of these efforts and it should come to no surprise that Lisp - based systems provide a very good platform to build more expressive DSL 's capable of improving the inference capabilities of the tools needed by biologists and physicians .
At this point in time , the " basic library " situation for CL is good enough to support its use in the field .
CLSQL and XML parsing libraries are the basis for such use .
Numerical libraries abound , as well as web development frameworks .
Writing inference engines and DSL's has never been a problem for CL programmers and researchers .
It is therefore a well founded conclusion that CL is a " well mixed solution " for Bioinformatics and Systems Biology , life , universe and everything else .
It just needs to be put together .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A rare and primitive frog living in a remote Borneo stream has no lungs and apparently absorbs oxygen through its skin , researchers reported on Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The aquatic frog has evolved backwards , re-acquiring a primordial trait , David Bickford of the National University of Singapore and colleagues reported .
Studying the frog could help shed light on how lungs evolved in the first place , they wrote in the journal Current Biology , adding that illegal gold mining in the area may threaten the unique species .
“ The evolution of lunglessness in tetrapods ( amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals ) is exceedingly rare , previously known only from amphibians -- two families of salamanders and a single species of caecilian ( blindworm ) , ” they wrote .
“ Here we report the first case of complete lunglessness in a frog , Barbourula kalimantanensis , from the Indonesian portion of Borneo . ”
The frog may be endangered because of mining activity , the researchers said .
“ In August 2007 , we visited ... near NangaPinoh , Western Kalimantan but found that illegal gold mining had destroyed all suitable habitats in the vicinity , ” they wrote .
They snorkeled , waded and turned over boulders to find their quarry .
“ The originally cool , clear , fast - flowing rivers are now warm and turbid .
Water quality around the ... locality is no longer suitable for the species , but we were able to re-discover two new populations upstream , ” they added .
“ We knew that we would have to be very lucky just to find the frog , ” Bickford said in a statement .
Animals evolved lungs when they moved from the sea to land millions of years ago .
Animals have only lost this important adaptation a few times , Bickford ’s team said .
“ The discovery of lunglessness in a secretive Bornean frog , supports the idea that lungs are a malleable trait in the Amphibia , the sister group of all living tetrapods .
Amphibians maybe more prone to lunglessness since they readily utilize other methods for gas exchange , ” they wrote .
“ This is an endangered frog that we know practically nothing about , with an amazing ability to breathe entirely through its skin , whose future is being destroyed by illegal gold mining by people who are marginalized and have no other means of supporting themselves , ” Bickford said .
Only animals with small body sizes , slow metabolisms and living in fast - flowing cold water where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged quickly may be able to survive without lungs , the researchers said .
“ We strongly encourage conservation of remaining habitats of this species , ” they recommended .
When I started this campaign more than a year ago , I was a somewhat reluctant candidate .
I knew our message of freedom , peace , and prosperity was the right one for our country , but frankly , I did n't know how many people today would have ears to hear it .
Well , did I learn a lesson !
Millions of Americans understand what ails our country , and what is needed to fix it .
So , with you at my side , I am in this effort to win .
Not only by building the ideas of liberty , but by getting the nomination .
Our opponents would call that nuts -- you know , the advocates of more inflation , more spending , more taxes , more war .
But let me explain why they are , as usual , all wet .
For one thing , for the first time since 1952 , we are headed towards a brokered convention .
Instead of a coronation of one of the establishment candidates , the delegates , influenced by the people , will decide .
And I am afraid that this will take place in a time of heightened economic crisis .
That means even more Americans will be ready to hear our message .
But it also means I am really going to need your help .
One would never know this from the mainstream media , but we 've only had a few primaries and caucuses , and even after the extremely important date of February 5th , we will still have more than half to go .
And the Republican nominee will not be decided by the popular vote among the " leading candidates " in a few states also handpicked by the media .
The nominee will be decided by the delegates .
So let me tell you a little about our " under - the - radar " strategy to get those delegates .
On " Super Tuesday , " February 5th , there will be 22 primaries and caucuses .
I have a hunch that we 're going to do very well .
But , of course , the media and the rest of the establishment refuse to recognize that .
It 's the attitude of the small child who covers his eyes to make something scary go away .
But we are not going away .
While the media focus on the couple of states they claim are important , we 're competing everywhere .
And the reason that we 're able to do that is because of your grassroots support .
You all are an asset that no other campaign has : donors , and activists who want no special deals from the government , just the Constitution .
We 're competing very strongly in all the caucus states , and in all other states where delegates are up for grabs .
And we 're going to keep picking up delegates .
Our strategy 's already working .
And we 're committed to winning states .
I have little doubt that if we can double our efforts in this coming week , we 're going to grab many delegates from other candidates .
Then we 'll start getting ready for the biggest moment of all - the convention in September .
The path to the convention is twisty , however .
When we were in Iowa , we got 10 % of the vote .
But no delegates were awarded that night .
That 's because voters did n't directly choose national convention delegates ; they selected the county and state delegates who will make that decision .
And if another candidate like Mike Huckabee is no longer in the race at the time of the state convention in June , his delegates are free to support whomever they want .
If we work extra hard , we can convert them into delegates for our campaign !
A similar thing happened in Nevada .
We won 14 % of the straw poll vote that the media reported on , but what they did n't tell you was that we may have gotten up to a third of Nevada 's delegates to their county conventions !
I always laughed when I heard some people say Nevada did n't matter .
Nevada chooses more delegates to the national convention than South Carolina .
So , while the media will focus on the results from Florida , and probably take down the campaign of my friend Rudy in the process , those results are less important to you and me .
Let them fight in Florida while we bring our message to Americans in other areas , like the economically hard - hit state of Maine .
We want to win as many delegates to the Republican National Convention as possible , even if other campaigns do n't see some areas of the country as " important .
But in this work , I need your help .
Help me get many , many delegates to this historic convention , by these three methods .
1. Donate .
Your generous contributions are essential if we 're going to keep going until September .
We need , frankly $ 5 million by February 5 to run more TV and radio ads in the Super Tuesday states .
Your help means everything : https://www.ronpaul2008.com/donate.
2. Canvass .
You can help us identify those who support our message in your precinct .
You can help us to convert others , too .
After all , your neighbors pay attention to you .
I am going to visit as much of the country as I can , but I need you as my partner in your area : https://voters.ronpaul2008.com.
3. ASK others to sign - up on our website .
I meet so many people on the campaign trail who do n't even receive my letters !
I 've told my campaign to make communication with you , the engine of all this , much better .
But if people do n't sign up for my e-mails , that wo n't happen .
If you could just get one extra person to sign - up , that would be great .
More would be tremendous .
Help me by forwarding this e-mail to every other Ron Paul supporter you know , and urging them to join our efforts !
https://www.ronpaul2008.com/join.
We 've come so far , but now the fun is really starting !
I have a feeling the mainstream media will move from ignoring us to attacking us .
But that will be a sign of our success .
Join me as we continue this great movement into year two , and to a hot convention in Minneapolis - Saint Paul .
We can do it !
Sincerely ,
Ron
Let me ask , does this remind anyone of a marijuana tax stamp ?
A ban on the sale of cigarettes to anyone who does not pay for a government smoking permit has been proposed by Health England , a ministerial advisory board .
The idea is the brainchild of the board ’s chairman , Julian Le Grand , who is a professor at the London School of Economics and was Tony Blair ’s senior health adviser .
In a paper being studied by Lord Darzi , the health minister appointed to oversee NHS reform , he says many smokers would be helped to break the habit if they had to make a decision whether to “ opt in ” .
The permit might cost as little as £ 10 , but acquiring it could be made difficult if the forms were sufficiently complex , Le Grand said last night .
His paper says : “ Suppose every individual who wanted to buy tobacco had to purchase a permit .
And suppose further they had to do this every year .
To get a permit would involve filling out a form and supplying a photograph , as well as paying the fee .
Permits would only be issued to those over 18 and evidence of age would have to be provided .
The money raised would go to the NHS . ”
I ’m sure that acquiring the permit would slowly become more and more difficult .
Just think , the day comes that you apply for the permit and your voice is a bit hoarse from having a cold , or from cheering on your favorite “ football ” team , and they interpret the voice as an indication that you ’re unhealthy and deny your permit .
In fact , it seems like this is one more step in the goal of eventually making smoking downright illegal .
If they were n’t making enormous taxes off the sale of cigarettes , they ’d already have done it .
Of course , you may point out that if they make cigarettes illegal , only the criminals will have cigarettes .
And I ’d point out that you ’re right , as high cigarette taxes have already created a black market that will only expand with a law like this :
The paper , written by Le Grand and Divya Srivastava , an LSE researcher , acknowledges : “ Administratively it would require addressing the problem of the existing black markets and smuggling in tobacco ; but this should probably be done anyway . ”
Hell , if the government can’t stop bacon - wrapped hot dogs , how are they going to stop addictive drugs ?

My subject species is the teddy bear : a creature made by humans ( and made ‘ alive ’ by imagination ) whose morphological history is tied to social trends .
My idea of ‘ logical ’ evidence ( a stuffed animal would have a skull made of felt ) becomes an emotionally loaded image that brings up a wide range of responses and proves to be ripe for further exploration .
Wonderfully creative .
I wonder if Stephanie will consider doing the rest of the teddy bear skeleton ?

One would not have thought it
possible for the internet bubble of the late
1990s , the greatest boom in the history of the world , to be replaced within five
years by a real estate bubble of even greater magnitude and worse stupidity .
Under more normal circumstances , one would not have thought that the same
mistake could happen twice in the lifetimes of the people involved …
The most straightforward explanation begins with the view that all of these
bubbles are not truly separate , but instead represent different facets of a
single Great Boom of unprecedented size and duration .
As with the earlier
bubbles of the modern age , the Great Boom has been based on a similar story of
globalization , told and retold in different ways
– and so we have seen a rotating series of local booms and bubbles as investors
price a globally unified world through the prism of different markets .
Nevertheless , this Great Boom is also very different from all previous bubbles .
This time around , globalization either will succeed and humanity will achieve a
degree of freedom and prosperity that can scarcely be imagined , or
globalization will fail and capitalism or even humanity itself may come to an
end .
The real alternative to good globalization is world war .
And because of
the nature of today
‘s technology , such a war would be apocalyptic in the twenty - first century .
Because there is not much time left , the Great Boom , taken as a whole , either is
not a bubble at all , or it is the final and greatest bubble in history .
Constitutional Struggle
Discussion of how our Constitutional Rights are being chipped away .
Chinese troops were out in force in Lhasa on Sunday
Indian - based officials said the figure was confirmed by several sources , even though China put the death toll at 10 .
The Dalai Lama called for an international inquiry into China 's crackdown , accusing it of a " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " .
Chinese troops were out in force in Lhasa , Tibet 's main city , on Sunday .
Hong Kong Cable TV reported that about 200 military vehicles , each carrying 40 to 60 armed soldiers , had driven into the city .
Loudspeakers broadcast messages , such as : " Discern between enemies and friends , maintain order . "
China tightly restricts Western journalists ' access to Tibet and it is sometimes extremely difficult to verify what is going on .
Bodies
The BBC has learned that troops in neighbouring Sichuan province have been recalled from leave and put on standby .
TIBET DIVIDE China says Tibet always part of its territory Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before 20th century 1950 : China launched a military assault Opposition to Chinese rule led to bloody uprising in 1959 Tibet 's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India
Q&A : China and Tibet In pictures : Lhasa tense
A 23 - year - old Canadian student in Lhasa told AP : " The entire city is basically closed down . "
The Chinese crackdown followed rioting on Friday , that erupted after a week of mainly peaceful protests .
The Chinese official news agency Xinhua says 10 people died on Friday , including business people it said were " burnt to death " .
But the Tibetan government in exile later said at least 80 corpses had been counted , including those of 26 people killed on Saturday next to the Dratchi prison in Lhasa .
Other bodies were spotted near the Ramoche Buddhist temple , and near a Muslim mosque and a cathedral in Lhasa , said Tenzin Taklha , a senior aide to the Dalai Lama .
" These reports come from relatives , from our people inside and from contacts of our department of security .
They have all been confirmed multiple times , " he said .
Deadline to surrender
The demonstrators , who on Friday set fire to Chinese - owed shops and hurled rocks at local police , have been penned into an area of the old town by government forces .
The authorities in Tibet have urged the protesters to hand themselves in by midnight on Monday , promising leniency to those who surrender .
Meanwhile , there were reports of protests by Tibetans in other parts of China .
About 200 protesters threw petrol bombs and burned down a police station in Sichuan province , a police officer told Reuters .
There were reports that officers opened fire on the protesters .
In an interview with the BBC , the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader , said he feared there would be more deaths unless Beijing changed its policies towards Tibet , which it has ruled since invading in 1950 .
" It has become really very , very tense .
Now today and yesterday , the Tibetan side is determined .
The Chinese side also equally determined .
So that means , the result : killing , more suffering , " he said .
" Ultimately , the Chinese government is clinging of policy , not looking at the reality .
They simply feel they have gun - so they can control .
Obviously they can control .
But they cannot control human mind , " he warned .
The unrest erupted a fortnight before China 's Olympic celebrations kick off with the start of the torch relay , which is scheduled to pass through Tibet .
But the Dalai Lama emphasised that he still supported Beijing 's staging of the Olympic Games this summer , saying it was an opportunity for the Chinese to show their support for the principle of freedom .
The International Olympic Committee said it hoped to see the Tibetan unrest resolved peacefully , but its president Jacques Rogge rejected any boycott , saying it " does n't solve anything " .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Saturday urged China to " exercise restraint " in dealing with the protests .
She spoke as pro-Tibet demonstrations were held in Nepal , New York , Australia and several European cities .
Staples Becomes First National Retailer to Offer Everyday In - Store Recycling For Computers & Other Office Technology
May 21 / CSRwire / - FRAMINGHAM , Mass .--( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- May 21 , 2007 -- Staples ,
Inc. ( Nasdaq : SPLS ) , the world 's largest office products company , today announced that it now makes it easy to recycle used computers and other office technology at any Staples store nationwide , becoming the first national retailer to offer computer recycling in stores every day .
Staples makes it easy for customers to recycle e-waste by simply bringing their used computers , monitors , laptops , printers , faxes and all - in - ones to any U.S. Staples store , where the equipment will be recycled in accordance with environmental laws .
All brands will be accepted , regardless of whether or not the equipment was purchased at Staples , for a fee of $ 10 per large item .
Staples is working with Amandi Services , one of the country 's most experienced and innovative electronics recyclers , to handle recycling of the equipment , following standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
" It 's not always easy being green .
However , through the leadership of Staples , Americans will see that preventing pollution by recycling unwanted electronics is as easy as it gets , " said Stephen L. Johnson , Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
" EPA and our Plug - In To eCycling partners are helping make sure yesterday 's high - tech gadgets do not go to waste . "
" An estimated 133,000 computers are discarded every day in the U.S. , " said Mark Buckley , vice president of environmental affairs at Staples , Inc .
" We know that small businesses and consumers want to recycle their used office technology but are often frustrated by the lack of convenient options available .
By making it easy to recycle , Staples helps customers take action in handling e-waste in an environmentally responsible way . "
How the Recycling Program Works
-- Customers drop off their old equipment at the customer service desk at any Staples store , 7 days a week during regular store hours ; ( TV's and large , floor - model copiers are not accepted ) .
-- Staples will recycle any manufacturers ' products , regardless of whether or not it was purchased from Staples , and there 's no limit on the quantity of equipment that can be recycled .
-- A recycling fee of $ 10 per piece of large equipment is charged to cover handling , transport , product disassembly and recycling .
Smaller computer peripherals , such as keyboards and mice , will be recycled for free .
-- Staples Easy Tech ( sm ) service is on site in all stores to transfer data from an old computer to a new one for a fee .
Equipment is bagged and sealed when customers drop them off at the Staples customer service desk .
The equipment is then picked up and delivered to Amandi Services , who disassembles the equipment into its component parts and uses industry - leading standards for data destruction .
Amandi then recycles the raw materials , such as the plastics , metals , printed circuit boards and Cathode Ray Tubes ( CRT ) .
The CRTs , which are the most hazardous part of electronics waste , are recycled utilizing Amandi 's proprietary technology into a raw material that is used to manufacture new televisions .
Staples is a U.S. EPA Plug - In to eCycling partner and has offered computer recycling in its Seattle area stores for the past two years .
In addition to computer and office technology recycling , Staples provides customers with easy , everyday , in - store recycling for ink and toner cartridges , cell phones , PDAs and rechargeable batteries .
In 2006 , the company recycled more than 17 million ink and toner cartridges and 3,500 tons of electronic waste .
Staples Commitment to the Environment
In addition to recycling of technology items , Staples ' initiatives to help protect and sustain the earth take many forms , such as offering a wide assortment of eco-friendly products , investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy and educating customers and associates about how they can make a difference .
The company offers over 2,900 products made with recycled materials and is one of the largest retail and Fortune 500 purchasers of green power in the country .

We ’re all a security - conscious bunch of folks , right ?
How much attention do you pay to your email account ?
You probably do n’t give the password out to random strangers on the internet , I hope , but that ’s not the only way someone could be snooping on or tampering with your email .
In the Middle Ages , it was customary to seal an envelope with your personal seal stamped into hot wax .
If that seal was broken or did n’t properly match your seal , the recipient knew there was a chance someone had read , tampered with it , or even forged it .
The reality is that even if you never give out your password to anyone , your email is still being transmitted across a bunch of servers to reach its destination .
The admins of any of those servers could potentially do something nasty to your email .
You want to protect yourself , right ?
I almost always get asked about the odd line of numbers and letters at the bottom of my card .
The odd line is the fingerprint for my GPG public key .
GNU Privacy Guard , or GPG for short , is an implementation of the OpenPGP Standard .
PGP stands for “ Pretty Good Privacy . ”
It uses public and private keys to maintain privacy .
There ’s some ridiculously complex math behind it that has something to do with really big prime numbers , but I will avoid that topic .
The way it works , at a high level , is that each person has a public key and a private key .
They distribute their public key to anyone who asks .
Most people who use it just upload their public key to a keyserver from which anyone can download it .
Mine is on three .
The private key is , well , private .
There is , of course , a second level of authentication involved .
The private key is something you have .
There is also a passphrase , something you know .
A private key can only be used with a passphrase .
There are two options for how you want to secure something .
You can either encrypt the message , or you can sign it .
You could also do both .
I sign all of my emails .
At the end of the email , there is a crazy chunk of text , like this :
--=-Fl7DMsJyODjAF/ae737Q
Content - Type : application / pgp-signature ; name=signature.asc
Content - Description :
This is a digitally signed message part
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE -----
Version : GnuPG v1.4.6 ( GNU / Linux )
iD8DBQBIApy3ojm3DbyNMmkRArwCAKCwyKJI0c6oic50RQ8isnnCO2brfgCg5abI
16Jr6yVuswz1aIHfPavZ1Xo=
= Xhph
-----END PGP SIGNATURE -----
--=-Fl7DMsJyODjAF/ae737Q--
That ’s the signature .
It looks like a jumble , right ?
Well , if you save the message and run it through GPG , it can verify whether or not the signature is valid .
The signature is an encrypted hash of the message made using your private key .
Any holder of the public key can verify that the hash and the signature match .
It guarantees to the message recipient that there have been no alterations made to your message .
This is the least - obstructive and probably most common way your average GPG - user uses it .
It does not require that the recipient know about GPG , but if they do use it , it can give them some piece of mind .
Full message encryption does n’t really work for normal use unless everyone you communicate with has a public key .
It does provide considerably more privacy since your message will be unreadable to everyone except the intended recipient .
The message is encrypted using their public key , and when they receive it , they decrypt it using their private key and passphrase .
Nobody can snoop , great !
There is an upside and a downside to this , though .
They both are that there is no proof whatsoever that the message came from you .
If you want plausible deniability ( “ someone must ’ve spoofed my return address ! ” ) , this is great .
If you want the recipient to really be sure it was n’t forged , sign it as well .
Of course , being able to prove without a doubt who said what to whom could be problematic for certain types of people in certain lines of business .
For those people , just plain encryption is probably the best way to go .
If it ’s not signed , well , as I said , they have plausible deniability .
If it ’s encrypted and they just happen to forget their passphrase or accidentally delete their private key , um , oops ?
The encrypted message is now unrecoverable , kind of like those self - destructing messages spies always get in movies .
The simplest way to add privacy to your email is through a mail client , and I do n’t mean mutt .
If you use mutt , I ’m pretty sure you have to stick to CLI GPG .
For Thunderbird users , there is the Enigmail addon , named after the Enigma encryption scheme used in WWII .
Evolution and Kontact / KMail have GPG support built in .
For Outlook users , GData makes a plugin .
I know the site ’s in German , but there is an English version of the plugin .
Users of Apple ’s Mail can turn to GPGMail .
Finally , if you use Webmail and Firefox , there is FireGPG , which I would not trust for encryption with GMail because GMail sends unencrypted drafts to the server every few minutes .
GMail messages are best encrypted outside the browser and then copied and pasted .
In case you ’re wondering what ’s to keep some jerk from making a fake key , the answer is the web of trust .
The way it works is that you show someone else your fingerprint and your ID to demonstrate that it ’s yours .
They then use their key to sign your key , showing that they have verified it .
If you take a look at my key ’s entry on the keyserver , you will see that there are the names of 4 different individuals other than myself on that page .
They all verified that the key does belong to me and signed it .
You can also see that I have multiple email addresses listed on there so that when I send an email from one of those addresses , the mail client can also verify that it came from an approved email address .
Getting too many signatures is n’t such a good thing though .
Eventually those signatures just make the key huge .
Three is a good number .
Each person who signed my key has had theirs signed by someone else , and they ’ve had their signed , and so on and so forth until it ’s just one big web of people establishing trust for each other .

Smokers trying to quit in the future could do it with the help of cannabis based medicines , according to research from The University of Nottingham .
Teams of pharmacologists , studying the cannabis - like compounds which exist naturally in our bodies ( endocannabinoids ) , are exploring the potential for medical treatment .
This includes treating conditions as diverse as obesity , diabetes , depression and addiction to substances like nicotine .
Scientists have known about endocannabinoids since the mid-1990s .
This led to an explosion in the number of researchers looking into the future medical uses of cannabinoids and cannabis compounds .
Dr Steve Alexander , Associate Professor in the School of Biomedical Sciences , focused on a number of these projects in editing the first themed podcast for the British Journal of Pharmacology .
Dr Alexander said : " It is clear that there is very realistic potential for cannabinoids as medicines .
Scientists are looking at a range of possible applications . "
One of these researchers is Professor David Kendall , a cellular pharmacologist at the University : " The brain is full of cannabinoid receptors .
And so , not surprisingly with diseases like depression and anxiety , there 's a great deal of interest in exploiting these receptors and in doing so , developing anti-depressant compounds . "
Addiction is a real target -- researchers like Professor Kendall believe the endocannabinoids could be a crucial link to addictive behaviour : " We know that the endocannabinoid system is intimately involved in reward pathways and drug seeking behaviour .
So this tends to indicate that that if the link involving endocannabinoids and the reward pathway , using inhibitors , can be interrupted , it could turn down the drive to seek addictive agents like nicotine . "
Because cannabinoids have also been shown to bring down blood pressure , it is hoped that related compounds can be used in patients with conditions like hypertension .
Dr Michael Randall , a cardiovascular pharmacologist at the University has looked at how endocannabinoids cause blood vessels to relax .
" This could have many implications , " Dr Randall said .
" The endocannabinoids appear to lower blood pressure under certain conditions ; states of shock for example .
If the endocannabinoids are of physiological importance , this could have real therapeutic possibilities . "
" In terms of getting better medicines the endocannabinoid system has a lot to offer , " said Dr Alexander .
" The range of cannabis - related medicines is currently limited , but by increasing our knowledge in this area we can increase our stock . "

I saw this optical illusion at the MIT museum in Cambridge , at first I did n’t understand how it worked .
Later as I walked to the end of the room , I saw that someone had switched the drawings !
As I walked closer , they magically reverted back to Albert Einstein .
A trick ?
Nah , it was just an illusion !
STEP 1 : Eight Portraits
Here ’s what you see what you ’re far away , it looks like 8 different portraits !
STEP 2 : Watch as they magically turn to Einstein
Now , the expanded image ( Yes , it ’s the SAME image , just larger ) changes as you get closer .
It ’s JUST Einstein .
You can try , by expanding the image and stepping backward !
How did this work ?
When our eyes see the details when we get closer , it changes our perception of the image !
I shared this with many of my friends including my buddy Neil .
Update : From the comments , we should take time to credit Aude Oliva , Ph.D. who is the creator of this fine work .
I had a great time visiting the MIT museum and encourage you to check it out too !
A team of scientists representing six international institutions , including Texas A&M University , has succeeded in reaching the summit of Antarctica -- also a monumental achievement for ground - based astronomy -- to establish a new astronomical observatory at Dome Argus on the highest point of the Antarctic Plateau .
Two weeks after arriving Jan. 11 at " Dome A " for only the second time in history , an expedition team led by the Polar Research Institute of China ( PRIC ) has completed installation work on a revolutionary fully robotic observatory , dubbed PLATeau Observatory or PLATO , that Texas A&M astrophysicist Dr. Lifan Wang predicts will result in new insights into the universe once possible only from space .
" Dome A is believed to be the best site for ground - based astronomy , " explains Wang , one of the leaders of the scientific planning phase of the expedition , who holds the Mitchell - Heep - Munnerlyn Endowed Career Enhancement Professorship in Physics at Texas A&M and is head of the Chinese Center for Antarctic Astronomy .
" Unlike the stormy Antarctic coast , the plateau is a very quiet place with very low wind speed .
It is the coldest and driest place on Earth .
These are critical conditions of a good site at which to build an observatory . "
On Saturday the PRIC team featuring scientists from the National Astronomical Observatories of China carefully buttoned up their instruments and PLATO within the snug confines of the newly installed ground station .
They then boarded their snow tractors for the 18 - day , nearly non -stop return trip to the coast of Antarctica , leaving both PLATO and their telescopes behind for an 11 - month period poised to make astronomical history .
" This permanent facility marks the culmination of centuries of effort to find the best location on the planet from which to observe the universe , " Wang notes .
" With a telescope at Dome A , it is possible to achieve near - space quality images at a much lower cost than launching a telescope into space . "
Built by the University of New South Wales ( UNSW ) in Sydney , Australia , PLATO is designed to operate autonomously for up to 12 months at a time while sending back data via the Iridium satellite network .

Powered by an array of solar panels during summer and small , high - efficiency diesel engines through the darkest winter months , it will be efficient as well as environmentally friendly , according to its developers .
" By minimizing the need for human support , robotic facilities such as PLATO will play an important role in the future of Antarctic research , " says the UNSW 's Dr. Jon Lawrence , who led PLATO 's development .
A global team of scientists will be contributing PLATO 's instruments as part of the 2007 - 2008 International Polar Year that will see thousands of scientists -- including Wang and fellow Texas A&M astronomer Dr. Nicholas Suntzeff , both of the George P. and Cynthia Woods Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics and Astronomy -- from more than 60 nations conducting 200 projects examining a range of physical , biological and social research topics .
PLATO 's site - testing instruments include cameras that will measure the darkness of the sky , an acoustic radar to measure atmospheric turbulence and a monitor for very short microwave astronomy .
Seven telescopes -- four from China , two from Caltech and one from the University of Arizona and the University of Exeter that is partially funded by the National Science Foundation -- will take unique images of the heavens toward the South Pole .
One of the most important experiments is a set of four telescopes built at Purple Mountain Observatory , Nanjing , and the Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics Technology .
Each of the 14.5 - centimeter diameter telescopes is equipped with a different filter so that each can observe the sky in a different color or wavelength .
The telescopes can view a large field of the sky toward the South Pole area .
The system will generate continuous movies of the sky lasting for four months .
advertisement
" This is a scientific study that can only be done in Antarctica , " Wang explains .
" We will be able to study the variability of the stars and search for planets around those far - away stars . "
The 17 - person PRIC team began its trek to Dome A in November , leaving Shanghai aboard the Xue Long icebreaker and sailing to Fremantle , where they were met by the 7 - ton PLATO observatory , which had made the 4,000 - kilometer journey across the Nullabor Plain from Sydney by road .
After a further 18 days crossing the Southern Ocean , the Xue Long arrived at Zhongshan station , adjacent to Australia 's Davis Station on the Antarctic coast , where PLATO was loaded onto a sled and filled with the 4,000 liters of jet fuel that will power it throughout the winter .
The six - tractor caravan then covered the 1,300 - kilometer overland traverse from Zhongshan to Dome A in just three weeks , arriving at the historic site on Jan. 11 for the first time since a PRIC team made the initial journey three years earlier to install an automatic weather station and evaluate the site 's suitability for a permanent station .
Built to withstand some of the most extreme conditions on Earth , PLATO must endure temperatures that drop to - 90 C in winter as well as air pressure barely half of that at sea level .
The facility must operate completely unattended until the Chinese expeditioners return in January 2009 , as there will be no human being within 600 kilometers of Dome A now that the traverse team has departed .
During the next few years , China will spend more than $ 25 million constructing a permanent station at Dome A . Already there are plans to build an array of large , wide - field telescopes there to generate additional movies of the sky .
Astronomers now are working on the construction of AST3 -- the Antarctic Schmidt Telescopes -- a system of three , half - meter telescopes expected to find planets around other stars about the size of Earth , hundreds of supernovas useful for cosmological studies and many other variable objects .
WASHINGTON / PARIS ( Reuters ) - Food prices are soaring , a wealthier Asia is demanding better food and farmers can’t keep up .
In short , the world faces a food crisis and in some places it ’s already boiling over .
Around the globe , people are protesting and governments are responding with often counterproductive controls on prices and exports -- a new politics of scarcity in which ensuring food supplies is becoming a major challenge for the 21st century .
Plundered by severe weather in producing countries and by a boom in demand from fast - developing nations , the world ’s wheat stocks are at 30 - year lows .
Grain prices have been on the rise for five years , ending decades of cheap food .
Drought , a declining dollar , a shift of investment money into commodities and use of farm land to grow fuel have all contributed to food woes .
But population growth and the growing wealth of China and other emerging countries are likely to be more enduring factors .
World population is set to hit 9 billion by 2050 , and most of the extra 2.5 billion people will live in the developing world .
It is in these countries that the population is demanding dairy and meat , which require more land to produce .
“ This is an additional setback for the world economy , at a time when we are already going through major turbulence .
But the biggest drama is the impact of higher food prices on the poor , ” Angel Gurria , head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , or OECD , told Reuters .
In Gurria ’s native Mexico , tens of thousands took to the streets last year over the cost of tortillas , a national staple whose price rocketed in tandem with the price of corn ( maize ) .
Global food prices , based on United Nations records , rose 35 percent in the year to the end of January , markedly accelerating an upturn that began , gently at first , in 2002 .
Since then , prices have risen 65 percent .
In 2007 alone , according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization ’s world food index , dairy prices rose nearly 80 percent and grain 42 percent .
“ The recent rise in global food commodity prices is more than just a short - term blip , ” British think tank Chatham House said in January .
“ Society will have to decide the value to be placed on food and how ... market forces can be reconciled with domestic policy objectives . ”
Many countries are already facing these choices .
After long opposition , Mexico ’s government is considering lifting a ban on genetically modified crops , to allow its farmers to compete with the United States , where high - yield , genetically modified corn is the norm .
The European Union and parts of Africa have similar bans that could also be reconsidered .

A number of governments , including Egypt , Argentina , Kazakhstan , and China , have imposed restrictions to limit grain exports and keep more of their food at home .
This knee - jerk response to food emergencies can result in farmers producing less food and threatens to undermine years of effort to open up international trade .
“ If one country after the other adopts a ‘ starve - your - neighbor ’ policy , then eventually you trade smaller shares of total world production of agricultural products , and that in turn makes the prices more volatile , ” said Joachim von Braun , director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington .
In Argentina , a government tax on grain led to a strike by farmers that disrupted grain exports .
Vietnam and India , both major rice exporters , announced further curbs on overseas sales on Friday , sending rice higher on U.S. futures markets .
Other food commodities retreated from record highs in recent days but analysts attributed that less to fundamentals and more to profit - taking by investors .
DISCONTENT
In the next decade , the price of corn could rise 27 percent , oilseeds such as soybeans by 23 percent and rice 9 percent , according to tentative forecasts in February by the OECD and the U.N .
Waves of discontent are already starting to be felt .
Violent protests hit Cameroon and Burkina Faso in February .
Protesters rallied in Indonesia recently and media reported deaths by starvation .
In the Philippines , fast - food chains were urged to cut rice portions to counter a surge in prices .
Last year , the central bank of Australia -- where minds were focused by a two - year drought -- asked whether the surge in commodity prices could be one of the few really big ones in world history , like those of the mid-1930s or the 1970s .
Real commodity prices remained flat or even fell during the rapid industrialization of the United States and Germany in the early 20th century .
But the industrialization of China , with 1.3 billion people , is on a totally different scale , it noted .
“ China ’s population is proportionately much larger than the countries that industrialized in earlier periods and is almost double that of the current G7 nations combined , ” the Australian central bank said .
The emergence of China ’s middle class is adding hugely to demand for not just basic commodities like corn , soybeans and wheat , but also for meat , milk and other high - protein foods .

The Chinese , whose rise began in earnest in 2001 , ate just 20 kilograms ( 44 pounds ) of meat per capita in 1985 .
They now eat 50 kilograms ( 110 pounds ) a year .
Each pound of beef takes about seven pounds of grain to produce , which means land that could be used to grow food for humans is being diverted to growing animal feed .
BIOFUEL TROUBLE
As the West seeks to tackle the risk of global warming , a drive towards greener fuels is compounding the world ’s food problems .
It is estimated that one in four bushels of corn from this year ’s U.S. corn crop will be diverted to make fuel ethanol .
“ Turning food into fuel for cars is a major mistake on many fronts . ” said Janet Larsen , director of research at the Earth Policy Institute , an environmental group based in Washington .
“ One , we ’re already seeing higher food prices in the American supermarket .
Two , perhaps more serious from a global perspective , we ’re seeing higher food prices in developing countries where it ’s escalated as far as people rioting in the streets . ”
Similarly , palm oil is at record prices because of demand to use it for biofuel , causing pain for low income families in Indonesia and Malaysia , where it is a staple .
But despite the rising criticism of biofuels , the U.S. corn-fed ethanol industry enjoys wide political support because it boosts farmers , who suffered years of low prices , and that support is likely to continue .
John Bruton , the European Union ’s Ambassador to the United States , predicts that the world faces 10 to 15 years of steep rises in food costs .
And it is the poor in Africa and , increasingly , South East Asia , who will be most vulnerable .
The director of the U.N. World Food Program , Josette Sheeran , is on a global tour in search of donations to fill a $ 500 million funding gap caused by the rising prices .
America ’s largest aid program , Food for Peace , has seen its commodity prices jump 40 percent and may have to curtail donations .
But aid and many policy options available to governments for helping the hungry distort markets and cause pain elsewhere in their economies , according to proponents of free markets .
“ I was involved in a government that introduced food subsidies in Ireland and we had the devil ’s own job to get rid of them , ” said Bruton , who was Prime Minister of Ireland from 1994 to 1997 .
Others trust that better fertilizers and higher - yielding crops -- some of them genetically modified -- will keep production in line with demand .
Bruce Babcock , an economist at Iowa State University , said the rising markets are a signal to farmers that they need to raise production .
“ It ’s actually the greatest time in the world to be a farmer around the world , ” Babcock said .
“ We are going to see fairly substantial increases in production because farmers have never had such a large incentive to increase production . ”
But others note that expensive seeds and fertilizers are out of reach of farmers in poor countries .
Around the beginning of the 19th Century , British political economist Thomas Malthus said population had the potential to grow much faster than food supply , a prediction that efficient farming consistently proved wrong .
Now , at the beginning of the 21st century , some are revisiting his predictions .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Miami police could soon be the first in the United States to use cutting - edge , spy - in - the - sky technology to beef up their fight against crime .
The Honeywell Micro Air Vehicle or " Honeywell MAV " is seen during a flight test in this undated photograph taken at an undisclosed location .
The MAV weighs 16 pounds when empty ( dry ) and 18 1/2 pounds when fully loaded with fuel ( wet ) .
It is 14 inches in diameter and 22 inches from the feet to the top of the MAV structure .
Miami police could soon be the first in the United States to use cutting - edge , spy - in - the - sky technology to beef up their fight against crime .
REUTERS / Honeywell / Handout
A small pilotless drone manufactured by Honeywell International , capable of hovering and “ staring ” using electro - optic or infrared sensors , is expected to make its debut soon in the skies over the Florida Everglades .
If use of the drone wins Federal Aviation Administration approval after tests , the Miami - Dade Police Department will start flying the 14 - pound ( 6.3 kg ) drone over urban areas with an eye toward full - fledged employment in crime fighting .
“ Our intentions are to use it only in tactical situations as an extra set of eyes , ” said police department spokesman Juan Villalba .
“ We intend to use this to benefit us in carrying out our mission , ” he added , saying the wingless Honeywell aircraft , which fits into a backpack and is capable of vertical takeoff and landing , seems ideally suited for use by SWAT teams in hostage situations or dealing with “ barricaded subjects . ”
Miami -Dade police are not alone , however .
Taking their lead from the U.S. military , which has used drones in Iraq and Afghanistan for years , law enforcement agencies across the country have voiced a growing interest in using drones for domestic crime - fighting missions .
Known in the aerospace industry as UAVs , for unmanned aerial vehicles , drones have been under development for decades in the United States .
The CIA acknowledges that it developed a dragonfly - sized UAV known as the “ Insectohopter ” for laser - guided spy operations as long ago as the 1970s .
And other advanced work on robotic flyers has clearly been under way for quite some time .
“ The FBI is experimenting with a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles , ” said Marcus Thomas , an assistant director of the bureau ’s Operational Technology Division .
“ At this point they have been used mainly for search and rescue missions , ” he added .
“ It certainly is an up - and - coming technology and the FBI is researching additional uses for UAVs . ”
SAFETY , PRIVACY CONCERNS
U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been flying drones over the Arizona desert and southwest border with Mexico since 2006 and will soon deploy one in North Dakota to patrol the Canadian border as well .
This month , Customs and Border Protection spokesman Juan Munoz Torres said the agency would also begin test flights of a modified version of its large Predator B drones , built by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems , over the Gulf of Mexico .
Citing numerous safety concerns , the FAA -- the government agency responsible for regulating civil aviation -- has been slow in developing procedures for the use of UAVs by police departments .
“ You do n’t want one of these coming down on grandma ’s windshield when she ’s on her way to the grocery store , ” said Doug Davis , the FAA ’s program manager for unmanned aerial systems .
He acknowledged strong interest from law enforcement agencies in getting UAVs up and running , however , and said the smaller aircraft particularly were likely to have a “ huge economic impact ” over the next 10 years .
Getting clearance for police and other civilian agencies to fly can’t come soon enough for Billy Robinson , chief executive of Cyber Defense Systems Inc , a small start - up company in St. Petersburg , Florida .
His company makes an 8 - pound ( 3.6 kg ) kite - sized UAV that was flown for a time by police in Palm Bay , Florida , and in other towns , before the FAA stepped in .
“ We ’ve had interest from dozens of law enforcement agencies , ” said Robinson .
“ They ( the FAA ) are preventing a bunch of small companies such as ours from becoming profitable , ” he said .
Some privacy advocates , however , say rules and ordinances need to be drafted to protect civil liberties during surveillance operations .
“ There ’s been controversies all around about putting up surveillance cameras in public areas , ” said Howard Simon , Florida director of the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ Technological developments can be used by law enforcement in a way that enhances public safety , ” he said .
“ But every enhanced technology also contains a threat of further erosion of privacy . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The FBI has awarded a nearly $ 1 billion contract to Lockheed Martin to help create a massive computer database of people 's physical characteristics as part of an effort to better identify criminals and terrorists .
The FBI wants to use eye scans , combined with other data , to help identify suspects .
The overall deal is worth between $ 850 million to $ 1 billion and could run as long as 10 years , said Thomas Bush , the FBI 's assistant director of the Criminal Justice Information Services Division .
" We are looking forward to this future effort , " Bush said .
Judy Marks , the president of Lockheed 's Transport and Security Solutions division , said , " We 're tremendously pleased to partner with the agency once again to deliver the next quantum leap in capability . "
Watch what the FBI hopes to gain »
Lockheed Martin built the FBI 's current fingerprint database .
The new program is being billed as the Next Generation Identification -- and is assailed by privacy advocates who say it should cause alarm among all Americans .
" It 's the beginning of the surveillance society where you can be tracked anywhere , any time and all your movements , and eventually all your activities will be tracked and noted and correlated , " Barry Steinhardt , director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's Technology and Liberty Project , told CNN last month .

The FBI currently has 55 million sets of fingerprints on file .
In coming years , officials want to use the new database to compare palm prints , scars , tattoos , iris eye patterns and facial shapes .
Lockheed is being tapped with expanding the database to include these new types of biometric information .
The idea is to combine various pieces of information to positively identify someone .
" Fingerprints will still be the big player , " Bush told CNN .
But he quickly added , " Whatever the biometric that comes down the road , we need to be able to plug that in and play . "

Poll : Wright flap has n't hurt Obama RAW STORY
Published : Thursday March 27 , 2008

Print This Email This
The first significant poll since the flap over Barack Obama 's former pastor erupted this month shows the Rev. Jeremiah Wright 's comments have not damaged Obama 's prospects to take the Democratic nomination .
His opponent Hillary Clinton , meanwhile , sees her highest negative ratings yet in the NBC / Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday .
The two candidates remain tied among voters .
The Journal reports : Democratic pollster Peter Hart , who conducts the Journal / NBC polls with Republican pollster Bill McInturff , called the latest poll a " myth - buster " that showed the pastor controversy is " not the beginning of the end for the Obama campaign . "
But both Democrats , and especially New York 's Sen.
Clinton , are showing wounds from their prolonged and increasingly bitter nomination contest , which could weaken the ultimate nominee for the general - election showdown against Sen. McCain of Arizona .
Even among women , who are the base of Sen.
Clinton 's support , she now is viewed negatively by more voters than positively for the first time in a Journal / NBC poll .
The latest survey has the Democratic rivals in a dead heat , each with 45 % support from registered Democratic voters .
That is a slight improvement for Sen .
Obama , though a statistically insignificant one , from the last Journal / NBC poll , two weeks ago , which had Sen.
Clinton leading among Democratic voters , 47 % to 43 % .
While Sen. Clinton still leads among white Democrats , her edge shrank to eight points ( 49 % to 41 % ) from 12 points in early March ( 51 % to 39 % ) .
That seems to refute widespread speculation -- and fears among Sen .
Obama 's backers -- that he would lose white support for his bid to be the nation 's first African - American president over the controversy surrounding his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. of Chicago .
NBC political director Chuck Todd offers his observations on the poll :
As expected , one of the two major Democratic candidates saw a downturn in the latest NBC / WSJ poll , but it 's not the candidate that you think .
Hillary Clinton is sporting the lowest personal ratings of the campaign .
Moreover , her 37 % positive rating is the lowest the NBC / WSJ poll has recorded since March 2001 , two months after she was elected to the U.S. Senate from New York .
The poll was conducted Monday and Tuesday this week by Hart - McInturff and surveyed 700 registered voters , which gives the poll a margin of error of +/- 3.7 % .
In addition , we oversampled African - Americans in order to get a more reliable cross-tab on many of the questions we asked in this poll regarding Sen.
Barack Obama 's speech on race and overall response to last week 's Rev. Jeremiah Wright dustup .
On that issue specifically , 32 % of folks said he " sufficiently addressed the issue , " while 26 % of those folks believe he needs to address the Wright controversy further ; 31 % of voters surveyed did not see the speech or had no opinion .
Interestingly , of those voters who said they saw the speech , 47 % said Obama sufficiently addressed the Wright issue while 37 % said he needs to address it further .
Among whites , 45 % were satisfied with Obama 's explanation , 38 % were not ; Among blacks , 67 % said the speech was sufficient while 25 % want him to address it further .
Overall , 55 % of voters told us that they were " disturbed " by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright videos that circulated so widely on cable TV and the Internet .
US Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul says , " It 's a theory , the theory of evolution , and I do n't accept it " .
Sigh .
I am going to delve into this subject a lot more later .
Let me make two quick points .
First , the word theory is used differently in different contexts .
When you think of " theory " , you may think of the phrase , " it 's just a theory " , which makes a " theory " sound like a flippant thing .
But when a scientist says , " The theory of X " , or " So - and - so 's theory of X " , they mean , " the theoretical framework which convincingly explains X and has withstood many attempts at falsification " .
An example is " Newton 's theory of gravity " , which has been well tested in the regime to which it applies ( for strong fields , one needs general relativity ) .
Darwin's
Theory of Evolution is at least as well tested .
" I do n't accept the theory of evolution " is equivalent to saying , " I do n't accept the fundamental basis of our understanding of biology " .
It would mean , for example , invoking divine intervention to explain how Second , to say , .
It would mean , for example , invoking divine intervention to explain how drug - resistant bacteria arise .
If you reject the fundamental basis for biology and therefore most of modern medicine , I think you are unfit to be a world leader .
So , I hope at least some of Ron Paul 's many net supporters condemn his stance on the The Theory of Evolution .

This is part one of an ongoing series about Rubinius :
Rubinius for the Layman , Part 1 : Rubies All the Way Down
Rubinius for the Layman , Part 2 : How Rubinius is Friendly
In January , Antonio Cangiano wrote an article titled Why Engine Yard , Rubinius and Merb matter .
In his article he discussed the financing of Engine Yard .
More specifically , he discussed why EY was not just another irrelevant startup being funded by starry - eyed investors .
Au contraire !
Engine Yard is already recognized as a solid hosting service provider for Ruby on Rails , and has a customer base .
He then went on to discuss how they are going to use the money to fund the development of Merb and Rubinius by hiring the main contributors and paying them to work on these projects .
These two projects are very important for the future of the Ruby ecosystem .
Rubinius is an attempt at a very powerful Ruby VM while Merb is an attempt at a solid alternative to Rails , with its own distinct advantages .
It ’s great to hear that EY has taken it upon themselves to basically put both projects on steroids .
Being interested in the different Ruby interpreters / VMs , I was glad to get this overview of the event .
On the other hand , I was hoping to get more juicy bits on the technology side of Rubinius .
Since I ’m already familiar with the project ( from afar ) , I thought maybe I could come up with another more technical view on Rubinius .
Well , let ’s say a layman ’s technical view on Rubinius .
I ’ve been putting off this series of articles for a couple of weeks because I took the opportunity to talk about Rubinius at the last Montreal on Rails .
I did n’t want to steal my own punch lines on my blog before the presentation .
In this series of articles I ’ll try to present the Rubinius project from a technical point of view .
A 10 000 ft technical view , that is .
Some of what I say here is in part based on Evan Phoenix ’ presentation at RubyConf 2007 , so some of it could sound familiar to those who attended or watched the video ( highly recommended ) .
Q : What is Rubinius ?
A : A Ruby VM and Runtime written as much as possible in Ruby , and as little as possible in C .
The goal is eventually to completely eliminate the C code .
Of course , the first question that comes to mind is : WTF ?
It ’s a perfectly understandable reaction .
So in this first article I ’ll mostly address the 3 letter question .
The next articles will address all the other aspects of this fascinating project .
It ’s not a bad idea
It ’s a traditional milestone for any language : the ultimate level of dogfooding .
Implementing a VM or a runtime for a language with this very language means a lot in terms of the language ’s maturity and power .
And this is valid for many other technologies , too .
It ’s been a very important milestone for Subversion as well some years back , for example .
Their exponential growth really took off when they started using their own Subversion server to host their repository .
Some Ruby skeptics might say that Ruby is not fast and mature enough to implement a VM .
Let ’s first address the assertion that ‘ Ruby is slow ’ .
It ’s a sentence that does n’t really make sense , when you think about it : Ruby is a language .
Apart from being dynamic , very little of the language ’s characteristics fundamentally limit the performance it can get .
Its current performance problems rather come from its default interpreter , MRI .
As for the maturity of the language , I agree that some of its features may not be such great ideas .
Current work on alternative implementations has brought some of them to light , and from here they mostly look like features that are not in the right place .
If a project depends on ObjectSpace , well maybe a better design could circumvent that need .
And tainting might not be the most sound security model .
Whatever .
The parts that do n’t work are as of now slowly being weeded out by the different Ruby implementers , including by Matz himself who works on YARV .
So Ruby is maturing right now .
The ultimate level of dogfooding to help that process is to use it to implement itself .
It ’s actually a great idea
Who wants to program in Ruby ?
If you ’re interested in working on VM technology and you love the Ruby language , here are your options * :
Interpreter LOC ( non Ruby ) LOC ( Ruby ) MRI ( Ruby 1.8 ) 85 000 , C 0 YARV ( Ruby 1.9 ) 129 000 , C 0 JRuby 115 000 , Java ~ 1 000 IronRuby 48 000 , C# 0 Rubinius 25 000 , C 14 000
I finally have a day job writing Ruby ( thanks Carl ) .
I ’m sorry to tell you that I ’m not interested in going back to Java or C# in my spare time if I can help it .
Actually , the case is probably even stronger for my fellow programmers who work with Java or C# during the day , dreaming of coming back to their Ruby - red passionate lover at night .
Very few of them will come home and fire up Visual Studio / Eclipse / Netbeans , methinks .
Actually this is an overstatement : some of these projects are very open to contribution , while others are pretty much closed to outside contribution .
More on that later .
** These number are those from Evan ’s presentation at the end of 2007 , so they ’re probably quite outdated .
My other option was running sloccount on 5 projects I do n’t know closely enough and getting all the numbers wrong :-)
Getting feature - complete with how many lines of code ?
Another side effect of using Ruby to implement Rubinius seems to be often overlooked .
Rubinius is getting close to feature - complete with under 50 000 LOC .
Ruby ’s a very expressive language , remember ?
The Ruby part is reusable
Here ’s what I expect from a feature - complete Ruby interpreter :
Actually , if we look underneath , we see MRI and YARV are implemented that way :
When we look at Rubinius , as mentioned already , we see it ’s implemented like that :
So if I want to implement my own revolutionary Ruby interpreter with LOLCODE , I now have the option to implement a core VM and use as much as possible from Rubinius for the rest :
So by reusing Rubinius ’
Ruby runtime , 1.0 is gonna come much faster now .
If some parts are too slow and for some reason ca n’t be sped up enough with this approach , I can always get back to the bare metal LOLCODE when comes time to optimize performance .
Neat , is n’t it ?
But … how is that possible ?
Enough about why it ’s a great idea .
Is it even possible to implement Ruby in Ruby ( and end up with something decent ) ?
Actually , yes .
It ’s been done before for languages with similar characteristics .
Ruby ’s a dynamic language .
Dynamic languages have the reputation of being slow , right ?
I can concede that there ’s probably an upper bound to how fast a dynamic language can get .
And this upper bound is probably lower than that of a statically typed language .
But let ’s not forget that Smalltalk and Lisp are dynamic languages as well .
There are very fast implementations of both languages .
Word on the street is that Smalltalk has been seen running at about half the speed of C. Unfortunately , I have no actual precise reference on that .
You should therefore assume that it ’s a lie .
Just pay attention when you hear the name Strongtalk .
A lot of research has been made in the Smalltalk community in the past 30 years .
The Rubinius team is drawing on this research as well as other recent virtual machine research .
The VM is loosely based on the Smalltalk - 80 architecture as described in the Blue Book .
Still do n’t believe me ?
Here ’s how a recent build of Rubinius compares to MRI .
An overview
Comparison MRI Rubinius Blah blah blah Performance winner 12 / 41 28 / 41 Big improvement over the numbers shown by Evans at RubyConf 2007 Errors 2 0 Timeouts 2 2

So there ’s clearly something there , considering the fact that right now the focus is not really on performance , but rather on implementing features and on correctness .
Of course keep in mind that each one of these benchmark is merely a ( contrived ) measurement of the performance of a very specific operation , executed a bunch of times .
Every real life application will have it ’s own performance characteristics .
So do not read too much in the following numbers .
Leave that horse alone
I ’ll stop beating this dead horse , now .
Once you get past the ‘ Ruby in Ruby ’ part , there ’s still a lot of very interesting aspects to the Rubinius project , both technical and non-technical .
Stay tuned for the next installments , in which I ’ll cover some of these other aspects : specs for Ruby , in what ways Rubinius is friendly , enabling new use cases for Ruby , threading , replacing C and how Rubinius might eventually help Rails deployment .
Until then , here are few of the ways you can get more information about Rubinius :
It soon may be time to retire the phrase “ fall television season . ”
NBC Universal took a big step toward undoing one of the television industry ’s oldest traditions by announcing Tuesday that it would move to a year - round schedule of staggered program introductions .
The move is intended to appeal to advertisers , who crave fresh content to keep viewers tuned in .
And if it succeeds  and leads other broadcast networks to shift from their focus on a mass introduction of new shows  it could alter an American cultural cycle that extends all the way back to the days of radio , when families gathered around the Philco every September , as the school year began , to sample the new entertainment choices .
NBC plans to announce a 52 - week schedule in April , a month before ABC and CBS will unveil their fall lineups at splashy presentations known as upfronts .
The decision means that NBC will be committing to a new lineup of shows earlier than any of its competitors , while also inviting advertisers to build marketing plans around specific shows and perhaps to integrate brands and products into the plots of the shows themselves .
“ We absolutely think this is going to change the industry , ” said Michael Pilot , the head of sales for NBC .
That was one of the goals cited by Jeff Zucker , the president and chief executive of NBC Universal , in comments he has made recently about how the strike by Hollywood writers could create opportunities to change some of the ways networks do business .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
With Wall Street hit by a crisis of confidence , many are hoping the nation 's central bank can save the day .
The Federal Reserve 's main weapon : Cutting interest rates , and most economists expect a big slash of three - quarters of a percentage point on Tuesday .
But even those economists in favor of such a move concede it will do little to calm investor fears .
" It does n't address the fundamental problems , which is that financial markets are just scared , " said David Wyss , Standard & Poor 's chief economist .
" The Fed is trying , but they do n't have a magic wand to wave and make everyone confident again . "
In the past week , investors have come to expect even more aggressive action from the Fed .
The sudden collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns sparked fears that other Wall Street banks could be at risk .
Shares of Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) plunged more than 25 % in morning trading on Monday .
Concerns that another institution could collapse is one reason that the Fed will probably deliver another big rate cut .
But Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research and a critic of the Fed 's rate cuts , argues the Fed is feeding current market fears with emergency moves like Sunday night 's decision to make loans directly to Wall Street firms instead of just banks .
" Anytime you act on a Sunday night during ' 60 Minutes , ' if you do n't think that will engender fear , I do n't know what does , " said Yamarone .
He added that the Fed should not be trying to prevent failures by Wall Street firms .
" It was almost naive to think this was n't going to happen to someone , " he said .
" You do n't have a credit crisis of this magnitude and have every player sidestep calamity . "
But Lyle Gramley , a Fed governor from 1980 to 1985 and now a senior economic advisor for the Stanford Washington Research Group , said that such a failure would have far broader implications for the economy and the financial markets and the Fed has to do what it can to avoid that .
" If the Fed had sat aside and let Bear go down the tubes , the cascading effects would have been ghastly , " he said .
Still , Gramley concedes the Fed has only a limited ability to deal with market fears .
And he said that makes this economic crisis the most difficult challenge for the central bank since the Great Depression .
" In all past recessions , I was always quite sure that if the Fed stomped hard on the gas pedal , the economy would turn around and start to grow , " he said .
" But they 've now stomped hard on the gas , and credit is not more available , it 's less available . "
Gramley and some other experts believe the solution to the current credit crisis will have to come from Congress , not the Fed , and that the federal government will have to take steps to bail out both Wall Street firms holding mortgage - backed securities as well as homeowners who have mortgages with balances greater than the value of their homes .
" I think the federal government is going to have to recognize taxpayer money will be involved and the sooner we get going on that , the better , " Gramley said .
" The longer it takes to do that , the more expensive the bailout will be . "
The Fed took steps to assume some of that credit risk last week when it agreed to accept mortgage backed securities as collateral .
Still , Yamarone and other Fed critics argue that another round of rate cuts will do little but drive the value of the dollar lower versus the euro and the yen , which in turn will further drive up the prices of commodities such as oil and gold .
" Not one company is saying monetary policy is restrictive or that the current interest rate levels are impeding them from investing , " said Yamarone .
" A ( full percentage point ) cut would send the dollar into a potential collapse .
We 're in a free fall now , wait till you see what a collapse looks like . "
But many others think the Fed has no choice but to keep slashing rates .
" It helps , even if it does n't solve the problem , " said Wyss .
" You need to keep the cost of borrowing down .
It 's not the optimal solution , but it 's better than nothing . "
And no matter what the Fed does , market fears probably wo n't go away any time soon .
After all , some investors will probably take more Fed cuts as a sign that the central bank sees more trouble ahead .
" The market is going to stay worried , regardless of what the Fed does .
It 's heads you lose , tails you lose , " Wyss said .

According to a recent research , kids brought up in foster families have significantly higher IQ than their counterparts spending life in an orphanage .
The study conducted in Romania found that if children join foster families at an early age , they tend to do better .
However , these kids generally have lower IQ's than the kids raised by their biological families , the New York Times reported .
Expressing opinion over the research , a psychologist at the Wisconsin University , Seth Pollak said , '' What makes this study important is that it gives objective data to say that if you 're going to allow international adoptions , then it 's a good idea to speed things up and get kids into families quickly . ''
Comparing the effects of foster care with institutional child - rearing , the research took IQ tests and found that the foster children scored an average of 81 in comparison to 73 among the children brought up in an orphanage .
On the other hand , children grew up in their biological families had an average IQ of 109 at the same age .
How Doctors Tell Patients
They 're Dying
Important to Give Hope , Sense of Security , Docs Say
Telling patients they 're going to die is less dramatic than one might think , and contrary to popular belief , most doctors refuse to estimate how many weeks or months patients have left to live .
While initial reports of Patrick Swayze 's pancreatic cancer diagnosis came with predictions that the star would have only five weeks to live , the actor 's doctor quickly released a statement refuting the rumors .
" Patrick has a very limited amount of disease , and he appears to be responding well to treatment thus far , " Dr. George Fisher , Swayze 's physician , said in the statement .
" All the reports stating the time frame of his prognosis and his physical side effects are absolutely untrue .
We are considerably more optimistic . "
Putting a time stamp on someone 's life , several doctors told ABCNEWS.com , is something that few doctors are willing to do .
Instead , they employ much more methodical and caring techniques of breaking the news to terminally ill patients .
" It 's not [ a doctor 's ] job to take away hope but to try to provide support and be realistic as possible , " said Dr. Michael Grodin , the director of medical ethics at Boston University School of Medicine and Public Health .
" We are notoriously bad at predicting how much time a patient has left .
" You can obviously say that if someone has metastatic cancer that it 's unlikely they 're going to live for years , " said Grodin , who said that it 's always " very tough " to tell a patient he is dying .
" But then again I 've seen time and time again patients living much longer [ than predicted ] or dying much sooner . "
How Do You Tell Someone
They 're Going to Die ?
Many patients fear abandonment , Grodin said , so doctors must be sure to take the time to remind their terminally ill patients that even though a cure might be out of the question , their health is still important to them .
" Once they 're diagnosed as terminal they worry that because we have nothing to do for them [ in terms of a cure ] , we 'll desert them , " Grodin said .
" So we must tell them that 'we have many wonderful things to do for you so that you do n't have the pain and the suffering . ' "
Grodin , who trains residents on how to tell patients they 're dying , told ABCNEWS.com that doctors must be as straightforward as possible when delivering the news .
" Do n't use euphemisms , " said Grodin , who teaches his students to say " died " and never " passed away " in situations of emergency room traumas .
" You have to use the words ' terminal illness ' and explain it 's quite serious . "
But what about those patients who want to know how long they have to live and would prefer a more precise answer from their doctors ?
Dr. Nick Christakis , a professor of medical sociology at Harvard Medical School , said doctors should cater to that individual 's needs and be as honest as possible .
" Some patients say they do n't want to know anything , and others say , ' Give it to me straight , doc , ' " Christakis said .
" Once you 've established what kind of patient you 're dealing with , you should be as willing to be as specific as science allows . "
Even then , though , reminding patients that there are always exceptions to a doctor 's prognosis is important , Christakis added .
With Only Months to Live , How Do Patients Cope ?
While telling patients they 're going to die is arguably one of the hardest parts of being a doctor , being on the receiving end of the news is certainly not easy , either .
" There 's an overall pattern of how humans deal with forthcoming death , " said Sherri McCarthy , a professor of psychology and a grief counselor at Northern Arizona University .
" Shock or denial is a pretty universal first reaction .
Patients say ' it 's not me ' or ' I 'll go to a different doctor . ' "
Eventually , these feelings usually transform into depression or anger , McCarthy said , and then later into " bargaining , " a term used to describe when patients try to rationalize the situation and convince themselves they can do certain things to prevent their death .
And when they 've finally accepted their illness , what happens next depends largely on the individual patient , McCarthy said .
" With people who have the freedom to [ quit their jobs ] , it 's common to see redirection , " McCarthy said .
" They 're likely to think that they only have a limited time and say , ' I only have so much time to do the things I really want to do . ' "
Dr. Ken Doka , a senior consultant to the Hospice Foundation of America , said that everyone copes differently , and often people deal with death similar to the way they deal with other aspects of life .
" We die as we live , " Doka said .
" If we 're an angry person , then we tend to get angry at this .
Some will cope by ignoring it and going on about their life as best they can , others will frantically look to do everything they can to try to beat it . "
Said Boston University 's Grodin , " We deal with death and dying daily as doctors .
But most other people do n't .
There 's this assumption that people know how to do it .
" There are as many people as there are ways people die , " Grodin said .
" You must take each case as unique and separate . "
Superdelegates , if they choose to , can end the process
Shortly after Super Tuesday , DNC Chairman Howard Dean sounded a relatively optimistic note , noting his belief that Dems will have a nominee “ sometime in the middle of March or April . ”
If not , Dean said , he intended to “ make some kind of an arrangement . ”
Well , it ’s the middle of March , and road ahead still looks awfully long .
The superdelegates , who will ultimately make the difference in the process , are feeling more than a little antsy .
Lacking a clear route to the selection of a Democratic presidential nominee , the party ’s uncommitted superdelegates say they are growing increasingly concerned about the risks of a prolonged fight between Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , and perplexed about how to resolve the conflict . [… ]
While many superdelegates said they intended to keep their options open as the race continued to play out over the next three months , the interviews suggested that the playing field was tilting slightly toward Mr. Obama in one potentially vital respect .
Many of them said that in deciding whom to support , they would adopt what Mr. Obama ’s campaign has advocated as the essential principle : reflecting the will of the voters .
Mr. Obama has won more states , a greater share of the popular vote and more pledged delegates than Mrs. Clinton .
The NYT noted that the party leaders and insiders are “ uncertain about who , if anyone , would step in to fill a leadership vacuum and help guide the contest to a conclusion that would not weaken the Democratic ticket in the general election . ”
I ca n’t help but find this all a little odd .
The superdelegates need not look for someone to fill the vacuum and guide the contest ; they can fill the vacuum and guide the contest .
If they believe a prolonged fight would be bad for the party , they could choose to effectively end the process — today .
It ’s a fascinating NYT article , but it left me with the impression that superdelegates are missing the point of their role entirely .
The delegates said they hoped to avoid being portrayed as party elites overturning the will of Democratic voters .
They spoke of having some power broker — the names mentioned included Howard Dean , the chairman of the Democratic National Committee ; former Vice President Al Gore ; and Speaker Nancy Pelosi — step in to forge a deal .
The piece also noted that these superdelegates , influential party insiders , are hoping power - brokers will fix this so they ’ll be “ relieved of making an excruciating decision that could lose them friends and supporters at home . ”
Sorry to break it to the superdelegates , but this is in their hands .
They may not like the responsibility , and they may not want the responsibility , and they may not have signed up for this responsibility , but I ’m afraid none of that matters right now .
They can pick a candidate right now and he or she would be the nominee .
A lot of observers , including a lot of superdelegates , seem to have this notion of Dean and Gore , working the phones with the Clinton and Obama campaigns , trying to see if they can reach some kind of agreement .
That , I suspect , is pointless — neither Obama nor Clinton are prepared to drop out or accept the # 2 slot .
What party leaders could do , however , is work the phones to convince 200 uncommitted superdelegates to pick one candidate or the other and make a public announcement , en masse .
That would go a long way in showing one candidate or the other the writing on the wall .
“ Every day that this continues , people can surmise that this is going to the convention in Colorado and it could be decided by the superdelegates , ” said Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia , the head of the Democratic Governors Association .
“ There is not a superdelegate that I have spoken to who wants that to happen . ”
They ’re in luck .
These superdelegates — and , in all likelihood , only these superdelegates — can prevent this .
One candidate is going to enter the convention with more delegates , more states , and probably more popular votes .
If superdelegates find that compelling , fine , back Obama .
If they find other factors more compelling , fine , back Clinton .
But for superdelegates to sit around , wringing their hands , wanting the process to end while hoping for someone else to ease their burden of choice , is foolish .
Like it or not , this is up to them .
What are they waiting for ?

CNN LARRY KING LIVE
Sen. Barack Obama Speaks
Out on the Iraq War , Race , Hillary Clinton and Pastor Jeremiah Wright
Aired March 20 , 2008 - 21:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
LARRY KING , HOST , LARRY KING LIVE : Tonight , Barack Obama on the definitive this week , explaining his views on race and his former pastor .
Are those controversial issues behind him ?
How does he address Iraq ?
America 's role in the world ?
Barack Obama for the hour , next on LARRY KING LIVE .
Good evening .
Our special guest tonight is Senator Barack Obama , the Democrat of Illinois .
He is in Beckley , West Virginia .
It 's always good to see you .
And it was great having your wife with us , by the way .
She was terrific .
SEN .
BARACK OBAMA ( D - IL ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
She had a wonderful time , Larry .
Thanks .
KING : All right , let 's get first to the news of the day .
Michigan apparently is not going to recount its already - held primary .
Florida apparently is not going to do it .
What 's your solution to this ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , we 're going to abide by whatever rules the Democratic National Committee puts forward , as we 've done from the start .
You know , we were told it was n't going to count and so we did n't campaign there .
In fact , my name was n't on the ballot in Michigan .
But I think it 's important to make sure that the people of Michigan , the people of Florida , that their delegates are seated .
And so , you know , we 're committed to making sure that that happens in a fair and equitable way .
And I 'm confident that they will be participating fully in the Democratic convention .
And I 'm looking forward to hopefully campaigning there as the nominee .
KING : But if the decision is to seat the delegates voted on -- who went for Hillary Clinton -- would n't you protest that ?
OBAMA : Well , I think it obviously would n't make sense to seat them proportionally to the results of a Michigan ballot , for example , where my name did n't appear .
But I think that there should be some way for us to make sure that they 're seated , figure out how their votes should count .
And , you know , I 'm confident that some solution can be resolved that makes sure that they 're represented .
But , you know , ultimately , the people of Michigan and the people of Florida , they 're concerned about the same things that folks all across the country are concerned about .
They 're really concerned about what we 're going to do about this economy , what we 're going to do on the fifth anniversary of this war in Iraq .
And so , you know , I will leave it to the Democratic National Committee to -- and their various Rules Committees and Credentials Committees -- to figure out something that 's fair .
We 'll be , you know , making sure that the Michigan and Florida delegation are seated .
But what we want to do is , you know , make clear that the real focus of this election can't just be on the Rules Committee of the Democratic National Committee .
It 's got to be on the American people and how we 're going to deal with the enormous problems that we 're hearing about all across the country .
KING : Senator , do you fear any possible -- for want of a better word -- havoc at the convention over this ?
OBAMA : I think it will get resolved well before the convention .
You know , Larry , the truth is that we 've had a vigorous contest .
You know , Senator Clinton has been a tenacious competitor in this race .
We , obviously , have built a terrific campaign that we 're very proud of .
And you know , we 've won twice as many states as Senator Clinton and a larger share of the popular vote , more pledged delegates .
We feel good going into the convention .
I 'm sure that Senator Clinton , you know , feels good about the campaign she 's run .
I 'm confident that Democrats will come together , because we recognize there 's so much at stake .
When you 've got John McCain , the Republican nominee , who basically wants to continue Bush economic policies and wants to continue Bush 's foreign policy , it is really looking at a third term for George Bush carrying on that legacy .
Democrats -- and I think a lot of Independents , and even some disaffected Republicans -- recognize we need to move in a different direction .
And so whoever the nominee ends up being , I 'm confident about the Democrats being unified and really focusing on winning in November .
KING : So no fear of that .
Is there fear that you could go to Denver without a nominee ?
OBAMA : My hope is , is that it gets resolved before that .
I mean the last contest right now is scheduled for the third of June .
That is almost three months before the convention .
At that point , it should be pretty apparent who has the most delegates , who 's won the largest popular vote , who 's won the most states .
The superdelegates , I hope , at that stage , are going to weigh in heavily .
And I think it should be apparent at that point who the nominee is going to be .
KING : There 's a new national poll that shows Clinton now leading in the Gallup poll -- a tracking poll -- has Clinton ahead for the first time since February , 49 - 42 .
That 's a national poll .
How do you respond to that ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , it 's not surprising .
Obviously , we took some hits over the last week - and - a - half as a consequence of this flap around Reverend Wright .
And so that 's the news that people have been absorbing .
But , you know , this campaign now has lasted 15 months .
I mean there have been babies that have been born and are now walking and talking during the course of this campaign .
And so we 've had all kinds of ups and downs .
We were down 20 points at one stage .
We were up .
We were down again .
We were up .
You know , I have n't spent a lot of time paying attention to the day - to - day national polls .
What I 've tried to focus on is a message that the American people , you know , can hear , that speaks to the day - to - day issues they 're talking about around the kitchen table .
You know , people are in fear of losing their homes because of the home foreclosure crisis .
They 're concerned about what are we going to do to spur the economy and create jobs that pay a living wage .
They 're worried about the lack of health care .
And they 're worried about loved ones who have been deployed three or four times to Iraq .
Those are the issues that we talked about , insisting that we 've got to change how Washington does business if we 're going to have an impact on those issues .
That 's why I think we 've done well .
We 're going to keep on delivering that same message and I think that will carry us to the nomination and to victory in the general election .
KING : We 'll discuss Iraq in the next segment .
What about all of this has surprised you ?
OBAMA : Well , you know what surprised me is how hungry Americans are for change .
I mean I would n't be sitting here talking to you at this stage if the American people did n't recognize that we had to shift our politics in a fundamental way .
They know that special interests have dominated the agenda in Washington , that the insurance and the drug companies have , you know , helped to write our health care laws .
So that on prescription drugs , for example , you know , senior citizens are still paying more than their counterparts in Canada or even counterparts who get their drugs through the V.A. because the pharmaceutical lobby was able to prevent Medicare from negotiating for the cheapest available price on drugs .
People recognize that we 've got high gas bills .
The oil companies are making record profits .
And none of that 's being reinvested in building new refinery capacity or making sure that we 're developing alternative energies that can give relief at the pump .
And so they know we 've got to change those things .
And what 's been surprising to me is how responsive they 've been to our message of change .
KING : We 're going to take a break .
When we come back , we 'll talk about Iraq with Senator Barack Obama of Illinois .
Do n't go away .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
OBAMA : Yes , we can .
We will change this country and we 'll change the world .
We are ready to stand up and turn the page .
This is our time .
We can not wait .
We are ready to write the next great chapter in America 's story .
They 're looking backward .
We 're looking forwards .
Our time for change has come .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : We 're back with Senator Obama .
A " Washington Post " editorial today took issue with President Bush , with Senator Clinton and with you on all your respective positions on Iraq , calling them fantasies , saying that all your speeches promise the impossible .
On the suggestion of your troops withdrawal plans : " In the 16 months or so it would take to remove those forces , they envision " -- you and Senator Clinton -- " the near miraculous accomplishment of every political goal the Bush administration aimed at for five years -- from the establishment of a stable government to an agreement by Iraq 's neighbors to support it . "
Are you in fantasyland ?
( LAUGHTER )
OBAMA : Well , no , Larry .
And I think that " The Washington Post " mischaracterized my position .
What I 've said is that we need to begin a phased withdrawal out of Iraq .
I 've been saying this for a long time now .
And I warned from the outset , from the beginning of this war -- which I opposed -- that this was going to distract us from the fight we needed to fight in Afghanistan , that this was going to fan the flames of anti-American sentiment .
And once we were in , I said there were n't going to be any good options .
And I still believe that .
There are no good options in Iraq .
There are bad options and worse options .
The least bad option , I believe , is to begin a phased redeployment , send a clear signal to the Iraqi government it is time for them to stand up and negotiate the kinds of agreements that can stick and stabilize the country , to get the neighbors in Iraq involved -- and that includes not just our allies like Saudi Arabia and Jordan , but also Iran and Syria .
And to get the international community involved in creating a humanitarian assistance program , to have an international war crimes commission that can monitor any efforts at ethnic cleansing inside the country and that we would still have a strike force that would go after any attempts to create al Qaeda bases in Iraq .
Now is that going to be an ideal situation in which all the parties in Iraq have suddenly magically agreed ?
Of course not .
And I do n't know what " The Washington Post " thinks is going to happen if we just stay and continue in the same process we are now .
There are no magic bullets here .
But what we can do is at least put some pressure on the Iraqi government to make sure that we start seeing some changes .
KING : Yes .
The --
OBAMA : What we can do is start engaging all folks in the region around a plan to stabilize .
And what we can do is start reducing the enormous toll on both military families and on our treasury , so that we can refocus attention on what should have been our focus in the first place -- going after bin Laden , going after al Qaeda , focusing on Afghanistan , which has become more violent than at any time since 2001 .
That 's my plan .
That , I think , is what ultimately is going to make us safer .
KING : The president warned yesterday that withdrawal would end in chaos .
Let 's watch a little of what he said .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GEORGE W. BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :
If we were to allow our enemies to prevail in Iraq , the violence that is now declining would accelerate and Iraq would descend into chaos .
Al Qaeda would regain its lost sanctuaries and establish new ones , fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond Iraq 's borders , with serious consequences for the world 's economy .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : All right .
He 's saying that al Qaeda will run rampant under your plan and plans to withdraw .
How do you respond ?
OBAMA : Look , the -- you heard , I think , the other day , Senator McCain confuse al Qaeda with Shia radical militias inside of Iraq .
The president makes the same error .
He keeps on conflating al Qaeda with all that 's going on inside of Iraq .
In fact , Iraq is a majority Shia country that is violently opposed to al Qaeda .
The Sunnis inside of Iraq are now opposed to al Qaeda .
There 's no doubt that al Qaeda would try to get another foothold in there .
But to the extent that we 've brought Sunnis in and got them to buy into the central government , we can start making some progress .
In fact , that 's part of the reason that violence is down .
Not only have our troops performed magnificently and done everything we 've asked them to do , but you 've also got Sunni tribal leaders who have rejected al Qaeda and , in fact , are trying to cooperate .
So the notion that al Qaeda would run roughshod over Iraq is just not correct .
In contrast , you do have safe havens for al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
That we know .
We know for certain .
The Taliban has strengthened itself .
They 're using the funds from the heroin trade in that region to help finance much of what they 're doing .
And we 're seeing more suicide bombs , more violent attacks .
It 's starting to creep into the rest of Pakistan .
We know that 's where the people who killed 3,000 Americans are located .
And we have not been focused on that because of our obsession with Iraq .
So my argument about withdrawing out of Iraq is not because I do n't think that we can sustain this current burden indefinitely -- although , the fact is that will break the bank eventually .
We can't keep on spending $ 200 billion a year or $ 150 billion a year in Iraq .
It 's not just because it is straining our military and military families in extraordinary ways .
It 's also because it's not the best strategy to deal with terrorism , which should have been our focus from the start and has unfortunately been diverted into an effort in Iraq that has been counterproductive to that effort .
KING : If elected , would you go to Iraq ?
OBAMA : Absolutely .
Not only do I intend to go to Iraq , but I intend to travel throughout the region .
And I think that we should call a summit with Muslim leaders from around the world to talk to them about their need to partner with us to defeat radical terrorism and for our commitment to work with them as equal partners in creating opportunity for their people .
That attempt at broadening the conversation so that the Muslim world recognizes that we understand their aspirations and that we want them to be successful , stable societies , and to enlist them in the battle against the small corps of terrorists that are operating not just in the Middle East , but in many regions around the world , that effort , that message has not been delivered effectively by this president .
It 's something that I intend to do because , again , that 's part of what 's required to make us safer .
KING : By the way , would you go before taking office ?
Would you go between November and January ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , I think that I would like to go between November and January to talk to our troops and to thank them for their extraordinary efforts and to get a direct reading from commanders on the ground .
Because I think that it 's going to be important for us to make a clear - eyed assessment , not based on fact , not on the desire to save face from bad decisions that were made in the past , but to look very squarely at what is possible to achieve in Iraq at this point and how we can start executing a drawdown that is careful and prudent .
Keep in mind that , you know , the response oftentimes from people like President Bush or John McCain is that Obama is proposing a precipitous drawdown .
There 's nothing precipitous about what I 'm talking about .
KING : Yes .
OBAMA : You know , if after five years , were where we are now and we 're talking about another two years before we 've gotten combat troops out of Iraq , if we can't have completed this mission in an intelligent way after seven years , when originally this was supposed to be a $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion enterprise that was going to take about six months , then I think the American people , understandably , are going to be pretty frustrated , because this is not at all what was promised them by Senator McCain or by George Bush .
KING : We will touch other bases and return with Senator Barack Obama of Illinois right after this .

SEN .
HILLARY CLINTON ( D - NY ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
I think it 's imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander - in - chief threshold .
And I believe that I have done that .
Certainly Senator McCain has done that .
And you will have to ask Senator Obama with respect to his candidacy .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Is there a danger in that kind of thing , only in the fact that it would presume that if you get the nomination , the McCain people would run that throughout the campaign in an advertisement against you ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , I think Senator Clinton has been running a campaign out of the Republican playbook over the last several weeks .
And this whole notion that there is a commander - in - chief test that she feels she 's passed , you know , is based on pure assertion .
I mean , there 's nothing behind it that would demonstrate that .
You know , I have served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
She 's served on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
She has made , I believe , poor judgments when it comes to issues like the war in Iraq .
I 've made the right judgments .
And , so , really , the question for the commander - in - chief -- the next commander - in - chief -- is who is best - positioned to rally the world around a series of global threats that many countries have to deal with -- terrorism , you know , how are we going to deal with issues like climate change , how are we going to deal with issues like genocide and disease and refugees .
And that requires the kind of judgment that I think I 've shown not just on the issue on Iraq , but on questions like Pakistan , where I warned very early that we should n't put all our eggs in the President Musharraf basket , that we were alienating the people of Pakistan , even as we were neglecting going after terrorists ' safe havens in Pakistan .
On issues like diplomacy , where I 've talked about the need for direct diplomacy with countries like Iran to get them to stand down on nuclear weapons and stop the kinds of rhetoric against Israel and the funding of Hezbollah and Hamas .
You know , those are all issues that we need from the next commander - in - chief .
You know , when I answer that phone call at 3:00 in the morning , you know , what is going to be at issue is the kind of judgment that I can apply .
And I 've shown , I think , over the last several months , during the course of this campaign and the last several years in major foreign policy issues , that the judgment I 'm going to show is the judgment that 's needed to make this country safer .
KING : All right .
You 've served with her in the Senate .
Has her -- I do n't want to put words in your mouth -- has her campaign disappointed you , surprised you ?
OBAMA : Well , no .
I mean , look , as I 've said , she 's a tenacious campaigner .
I do n't think either her or husband like to lose .
And , you know , she herself and her campaign talked about a " kitchen sink " strategy , where we 're just going to throw a bunch of stuff a Senator Obama and see what sticks .
I understand that that 's the textbook way of operating in Washington .
I mean that 's what you do .
When you 're down , if you 're down in the polls , if you 've been losing a lot of races , then you throw a lot of negative stuff at your opponent .
That 's the kind of politics , in part , that I 'm looking to change .
Now , you know , we do n't mind drawing tough comparisons on issues .
But part of what I think the country needs right now is a little less rhetoric , a little less P.R. and spin , a little more straight talk , a little more honesty about the difficult issues that we 're going to solve .
And , you know , I have respect for Senator Clinton , her intelligence and her diligence .
I think she 's got some good ideas .
I think John McCain is an American hero and , you know , quick to honor his service on behalf of our country .
But we 've got some big problems that we 're facing right now .
You know , I meet families all of the time who literally are having to make decisions about do they drive to work this morning or do they pay the electricity bill .
I meet families who do n't have health care for their kids or themselves , despite the fact that they have one , two , three jobs , in some cases .
So those are the kinds of issues that are n't going to lend themselves to sound bites , they 're not going to lend themselves to clever ads .
What 's needed is for us to sit down in a pragmatic , practical way and try to figure out how we 're going to solve these problems .
And one last point I want to make , Larry .
You know , both Senator Clinton and John McCain , when they talk about their experience or preparedness for president , what they 're really referring to is how long they 've been in Washington .
And , you know , I think most of your viewers recognize Washington does n't work and it has n't worked .
And part of the reason is , is because the special interests and the lobbyists are contributing enormous sums of money .
Lobbyists are active in writing legislation .
And Senator Clinton has said that they 're not really a problem , that they represent real people , that they represent ordinary Americans .
Well , I disagree with that .
I think they 're part of a problem in Washington .
And both Senator McCain and Senator Clinton have been willing to take enormous sums of money from those lobbyists and those special interests .
And that , I think , inhibits their ability to bring about the kinds of real change that Americans need to see -- the economy get better and for their lives to improve .
KING : We 'll take a break and come back .
The race issue has come to the forefront .
We 'll ask the senator about it right after this .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
OBAMA : America is ready to embrace the policies of the future .

That 's why I 'm running for president of the United States of America .

KING : The race issue has come to the forefront .
Our guest is Senator Barack Obama .
I guess most people would be saying , why not just leave the church of Reverend Wright ?
I know you have been in that church a long time , been close to him .
He has a major involvement in your family , but based on what he said , why not just say goodbye ?
OBAMA : Well , he has retired , Larry .
So you know , he preached his last sermon already .
KING : But that was the church .
OBAMA : But -- let me ...
KING : All right .
Never mind , go ahead .
OBAMA : Yes , well , you know , let 's just broaden this for a second .
You know , I gave obviously a major speech about this issue and race in general on Tuesday .
And you know , what I have said consistently is that what Reverend Wright said that has become the issue of controversy was completely inexcusable and unacceptable .
And I completely disavow any of those statement that were made .
They were statements that I was n't aware of , were not brought to my attention until fairly recently .
I was n't in the church when he said those things .
And there are no excuses for it .
I think they were divisive .
I think that they demeaned our country in powerful ways .
What I have also said is that that was n't typical of what I heard from Reverend Wright , that the church that I have attended for 15 years is a very conventional Christian church , a African - American church , squarely grounded in the tradition of the African - American church , that we talk mostly about Christ and salvation and sin and mercy and justice and hope , that it is a bedrock of the South Side of Chicago .
It has enormous attendance with people from all walks of life .
And so given that Reverend Wright was retiring , I have no reason to leave the church .
And what I also have tried to point out is that had I known that many of these comments were being made , I would have confronted Reverend Wright directly .
And if he had continued to argue these points or if I had heard them in the church , I might have left .
But that is not what happened .
KING : You are saying it was n't the church , it was him .
And since he is not there , you are still in the church .
OBAMA : You know , I mean , I -- I mean , I think that what is true is , is that Reverend Wright made some very reckless and hurtful statements .
And -- but you know , he is also somebody who preached for 30 years .
And what we have been seeing are sound bites compressed into 30 seconds or a minute or two minutes from somebody who performed three services at least a week for 20 , 30 years .
KING : How do you --
OBAMA : And so that does n't in any way excuse it , it just -- it is just to point out , Larry , that I do n't think that typifies the service that I was attending on an on - going basis .
And more broadly , the point that I tried to make on Tuesday was that , you know , there are a lot of objectionable things that are said within the African - American community when it comes to racial issues .
There is a lot of anger that is pent - up .
You know , I hear it in a variety of settings .
And what I want to be held accountable for are the things that I say , the things that I believe , the things I promote .
And I think that anybody who has followed my career knows that my entire career has been built around the idea of bringing people together , listening to each other , engaging in understanding .
And that partly is necessitated from my own upbringing .
I mean , I am somebody who comes from a mixed family .
My mother was white .
I was raised by her and my white grandparents in Hawaii , a place where there was great diversity .
And so , you know , I think it is important just to recognize that I am rooted in the African - American community .
There are flaws within the African - American community , just as there are in any other community .
But the basic approach that I have taken , not just to race issues , but to all issues , has been the need for us to come together as Americans and to perfect our union over time .
And that is really what the speech was about on Tuesday .
KING : A couple of other things in that area .
Have you have had any communication with the reverend since all of this ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , I have n't .
He was actually -- because , as I said , he preached his last sermon .
He is on sabbatical .
He went to take a cruise .
He was not available by phone .
You know , I had spoken to him earlier when some of these sermons first came to light .
I had spoken to him earlier and told him that , you know , I was uncomfortable and objected strongly to some of these statements .
But that , you know , obviously he had played an important part in bringing me to my faith , and that I hoped our relationship would continue .
I have n't talked to him since that time .
And I 'm sure that , you know , he has a lot to think about , given the firestorm that has erupted over time .
And you know , I suspect that I will talk to him at some point , to get his feelings on the issue .
KING : We 'll take a look at the other side of the coin when we come back .
Our guest is Senator Barack Obama of Illinois on this edition of LARRY KING LIVE .
Do n't go away .

OBAMA : If we could just get past the divisions of race and religion and region , then there is nothing we could not do , no destiny we could not fulfill .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : We 're back with Senator Obama .
What might be the other side of the coin , Martin Marty , who is white , and one of America 's foremost theologians , has known Reverend Wright for 35 years , attended many of his services , and is quoted in today 's " New York Times " defending the reverend .
He says , " You hear hope , hope , hope .
It 's not anti-white .
I do n't know anyone who walks out of there not feeling affirmed . "
How would you comment on that ?
OBAMA : Well , Martin Marty
I think is one of the greatest theologians that we have .
And I think his characterization is accurate .
As I said , there 's been a caricature of Reverend Wright and the church that 's been out there .
Now , given the reckless and offensive statements that have been played , it 's understandable that people have a negative reaction .
And I understand that .
And as I said , Reverend Wright 's comments were inexcusable .
But I do think it 's important just to recognize that this has been a church that 's been the pillar of the community , that is part of a 99 percent white denomination , the United Church of Christ .
People come to visit from within the denomination .
They come from all across the country , mostly white visitors , always feel welcome .
There are white members of the church .
And so there has been some distortion , in terms of what this church is about .
It 's engaged in tremendous ministries , in reaching out to people with HIV / AIDS .
It has been very progressive on issues , for example , related to gays and other social issues that are difficult , but the church has dealt with in a generous , and hopeful , and welcoming way .
So some of this , I think , has been a distortion .
But really what this did was open up , I think , a larger set of issues , which is there are still suspicions and misunderstandings , anger and resentments that bubble up between the races .
I do n't think it should eclipse , though , what we have in common .
And this is part of what I 've talked about and written about in my two books , " Dreams for my Father " and " Audacity of Hope . "
I 've talked about the fact that this is a difficult issue ; it 's one that we have n't overcome .
But we 've made enormous progress during my lifetime .
And what I find , when I travel all around the country , is that blacks , whites , Hispanics , Asians , Native Americans , we have so much more in common as Americans than we do what divides us .
And I regret the fact that Reverend Wright obsessed on the divisions instead of what brings us together .
And I hope that , during the course of the remainder of the campaign , that this is something that we talk about , that it 's out in the open , but that it does n't override the common interests the people have in making sure that all our kids are getting a decent education and going to college , the common interest all of us have in making sure that the economy provides good jobs with good wages , the common interest all of us have in making sure that every single American has decent health care , the common interest we have in making sure that every senior citizen can retire with dignity and respect .
Those are the issues that I think sometimes we fail to deal with because we get distracted by issues related to race or some of these other hot - button issues that cause up a big stir .
I mean , I wish that we had seen over the last week as much time devoted to my healthcare plan or Senator Clinton 's healthcare plan or John McCain 's healthcare plan or our plans to invest in science and technology , to keep our economy at the cutting edge .
Those are not as sexy , but in some ways those are the things that all Americans have a great investment in .
KING :
The senator spoke eloquently the other night about his relationship with his white grandmother .
And when we come back , we 'll show you a clip of that and ask him about it .
Watch .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
OBAMA : I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community .
I can no more disown him than I can disown my white grandmother , a woman who helped raise me , a woman who sacrificed again and again for me , a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world , but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : You called her today a " typical white person , " meaning what , Senator ?
OBAMA : Well , what I meant really was that some of the fears of street crime and some of the stereotypes that go along with that , you know , were responses that I think many people feel .
She 's not extraordinary in that regard .
She 's somebody who I love as much as anybody .
I mean , she has literally helped to raise me .
But those are fears that are embedded in our culture and embedded in our society .
And , you know , even within our own families , even within a family like mine that is diverse , you know , there are those gaps in understanding or the stereotypes that are fed by the news media and fed by what we see around us and , you know , in our popular culture .
And so the point I made is , is that good people , people who are not in any way racist , are still subject to some of these images and stereotypes and that it 's very hard to escape from them .
KING : Do you think all this might hurt your campaign ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , I think that my campaign has always been built on a confidence in the American people , that we can talk honestly about issues , that we can acknowledge that they 're complicated , that we can disagree without being disagreeable , that we can understand each other 's point of view , and that if we take the time to listen to each other , if we 're honest with each other , if we 're not trying to demonize each other , then we can solve problems , that we can , in very practical ways , start investing in infrastructure to put people back to work in this country , that we can invest in clean energy , that solar and wind and , you know , loosen our dependence on foreign oil , that we can educate all our kids , that we can have a foreign policy that 's sensible .
So I think that this is a good example of the kinds of tough , sometimes uncomfortable issues that are going to come up in our politics .
But I have confidence in the American people 's fairness , that they 're going to judge me based on who I am , what I 've talked about , the kind of campaign we 've run , and the track record of 20 years of service .
And if they believe that I can help them in their lives and make their lives and their children 's lives and grandkids ' lives a little bit better , then I have confidence that they 're going to support me and we have a chance to really change this country .
KING : We have a few brief minutes left with Senator Barack Obama , and we 'll spend them right after this message .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : A couple of quick things , Senator .
Would you , in your administration , make use of Bill Clinton ?
OBAMA : Absolutely .
I think that , you know , Bill Clinton is a brilliant statesman and politician , and I think that any president would want to use his skills and his relationships around the world .
By the way , I would reach out to the first George Bush .
You know , one of the things that I think George H.W.
Bush does n't get enough credit for was his foreign policy team and the way that he helped negotiate the end of the Cold War and prosecuted the Gulf War .
That cost us 20 billion dollars .
That 's all it cost .
It was extremely successful .
I think there were a lot of very wise people .
So I want a bipartisan team that can help to provide me good advice and counsel when I 'm president of the United States .
KING : Would you consider Senator Hillary Clinton for a vice presidential nod ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , I think it 's premature , but also presumptuous of me to start talking about her as a V.P. candidate when she 's still contesting this nomination .
And I think that --
KING : That 's fair .
OBAMA : But I 'll tell you she 's a smart lady .
KING : The McCain campaign has suspended a staff member -- did it this afternoon -- for distributing a YouTube video that questioned your patriotism .
It included footage from Reverend Wright 's controversial sermons .
Any comment on Senator McCain doing that ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , Senator McCain actually has generally operated in an honorable way .
We 've got obviously strong disagreements , but when , for example , there was a supporter that kept on just repeating my middle name over and over again , obviously trying to implicate , you know , suggest somehow that I was not the kind of candidate that America would want , Senator McCain spoke out forcefully against it .
So I respect that he , I think , so far , has run an honorable campaign , and I intend to show him the same courtesy when we meet in the general election .
KING : Senator McCain has been a guest here a couple of weeks ago , been a frequent guest .
Senator Clinton , of course , is always invited .
And Senator Obama will always be invited back .
One other quick thing , how are you going to do in Pennsylvania ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , I think Pennsylvania is going to be a real struggle and battle for us .
We 're going to be working hard .
Senator Clinton , I think , has a significant lead and she 's got a very popular governor in her corner , who 's out there gathering up a lot of institutional support .
But we 've always been best when we 're the underdog .
We 're scrappy .
And so we 're going to work hard and reach out to as many people as possible .
And I think we can do very well , as well as in the other states , North Carolina , I 'm in West Virginia today , Oregon , Kentucky , Indiana , Montana , South Dakota , and Puerto Rico .
We 've got a lot of contests still remaining .
And in each of those , our attitude has been we work hard in all of them .
We try to deliver our message of bringing people together and overcoming the special interests in Washington , speaking the truth .
And that 's been successful so far .
Hopefully , it will be successful everywhere that remains .
KING : Thank you , Senator .
Good luck down the trail .
Always good seeing you .

Part Four
Barbarians
At the Gates
From the very beginning , the American crusade of surge and siege – with much of it predating the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq ; think to early 20th century agreements with Saudi royalty of protection for petroleum , or the overthrow of Iran ’s democratically elected nationalist leader , or CIA coups and installing of tyranny , or support for Saddam , or provocations of war , or fanning the flames of violence , or importation of billions worth of weapons – has been a catastrophe for the people of the Middle East .
For years the United States has guided policy and fates in the region , with its unchallenged domination of and immoral support in the regimes of the Middle East causing a complete devolution of a dynamic , intelligent and proud amalgam of peoples , continuing a stagnation of a civilization that has given humanity so much , and which has so much yet to offer .
It has been the support of tyrants , dictators , generals , kings , princes and sheiks which has had the most profound effect in the lives of tens of millions of Arabs and Muslims , altering , perhaps indefinitely , the very foundations of a culture , and religion , that has for centuries been bombarded by the Judeo - Christian values of the western world .
From Napoleon to Hitler , from the British Empire of old to the American Empire of today , from French domination of the Levant to the ceaseless criminality of Little Sparta in Palestine , the Middle East has been invaded , colonized , raped , pillaged , oppressed and exploited by western powers for decades .
It has been divided and torn apart according to the desires of colonial powers ; it has been invaded countless times by Christian Crusaders seeking some combination of god and glory , power and control , hegemony and imperialism .
Throughout European , and later American , interventions in the region , countless numbers of Arabs and Muslims suffered and died .
It has been the west , and not the peoples of the Middle East , that have for centuries been the aggressors , the barbarians at the gates of Muslim cities , those doing the invading and occupying , those raping and pillaging , those with the messianic delusion to convert and civilize and control the Arab world .
It has been the west that thinks itself the superior race , thinking Middle Easterners inferior , sub - human heathens .
It has been the west that ignores the plight of the dehumanized and the oppressed , all the while enjoying the spoils of plunder , over time becoming morbidly obese with the gluttony and greed cheap oil engenders .
The people of the Middle East were not , after all , the ones responsible for the Napoleonic Wars , nor the creators of two World Wars , nor the destroyers of entire cities , nor the barbarians giving rise to Holocausts , or thousand year old persecutions , nor the ones responsible for the death of tens of millions of human beings during the 20th century .
The people of the Middle East were not planting puppet regimes throughout Europe and the Americas , nor were they wishing to convert , civilize and control the western world .
They are not the ones in pursuit of imperialism and hegemony .
They were not bombing and killing and seeking vengeance outside their region until after the Second World War , after America , with help from her allies , decided the Middle East was to become part of its sphere of influence .
Indeed , for centuries living in peace and respect , in the same lands , cities and neighborhoods , Arabs of Muslim , Christian and Jewish faith have long maintained a balance of tolerance between Muslim majority and Jewish , Christian minorities that has only been disrupted with the arrival , and the manipulations and gross injustice , of the western colonial powers .
For decades preferring to control the region by proxy , in a clandestine manipulation of populations and territory , the United States has become a catastrophe upon the peoples of the Middle East .
Its vast assortment of puppets and castrated proctors have proceeded to decimate the lives and futures of millions , over the years maintaining a firm grip over nations through the devastation of freedoms and liberties and rights , along with the implementation of authoritarian and despotic policies .
Unwavering in its support of these tyrants , America has condemned millions to the brutality of dictatorships , to the censorship by despots , to the corruption of incompetents , to the regressive policies of control , to the backwardness of monarchs .
Sponsoring Tyranny
Possessing the largest , most plentiful and best developed oil fields known to man , one would be inclined to believe the Middle East a bastion of equality and justice , with standards of living equal to or surpassing those of the industrialized world .
We would expect a thriving democracy pregnant with the freedoms and liberties inherent in wealthy nations .
We would also expect , as we do with rich European and American nations , that the countries of the Middle East would possess a high degree of education among its population , allowing for rule of law and foundations of secularism to prevail .
We would expect a thriving middle class , with employment at levels supportive of such dynamics .
We would expect peace and balance .
Instead , in the land of black gold there exists not a shred of democracy , nor an ounce of freedom and liberties , nor an appearance by redistribution of oil wealth .
In the lands where humankind first developed civilization , Machiavellian authoritarians rule , police states flourish , and backwardness prevails .
Here , where a few elite are reaping the bountiful rewards of having oil below their feet , or having the lands deemed strategic to the Empire , accumulating millions and billions of dollars in profit , building majestic palaces and living the lives of gods , the vast majority struggle to survive and make a decent living .
Here , in the land of kingdoms and fiefdoms and gold - plated palaces , the majority of Arabs and Muslims live in indigence , finding work only as the serfs enabling their Arab lords to live in luxury .
Millions manage to survive only because their masters throw a few insignificant crumbs and bones their way , a minute sum of the enormous oil and gas windfall they greedily ensnare for themselves .
While millions subsist on meager jobs , millions more struggle to find meaningful employment .
Unemployment in the region is therefore high , with military - age males the hardest hit .
Without employment there is no source of income to survive ; there is no morale to feel proud of ; there is no sign of opportunity , no sign of a future .
With an education that is insignificant , for that is how kings and dictators want it , millions have no option but to become easy targets to the propaganda and the manipulations of their lords .
Indeed , in order to better control the population , education has become a tool of indoctrination , with millions of dollars invested by the elite into religious institutions that brainwash and mold vulnerable minds to the fantasy of theology and the backwardness of extremist ideology .
Subsidized and sponsored by the same kings and tyrants , these schools , rather than move society forward towards progressive goals , instead succeed in devolving into backwardness and fundamentalism .
Many Muslims simply have no choice but to attend these schools , for oftentimes they are the only schools around , in the process helping indigent families cope with the realities of daily life .
So long as ignorance prevails , and as long as knowledge and leanings of modernity are sequestered and mired in the inescapable grip of poverty , the Middle East ’s despotic leaders will remain secure and without fear of their own people .
So long as their people are not educated to the methodical condemnation of their lives by kings and despots , leaders will reign , sitting on the thrones of gold , feasting on the spoils thrown at them by the Empire .
This reality the Empire tolerates and even encourages , for a controlled , undereducated and powerless people are more likely to remain compliant and passive than those who see with open eyes the pillage of their land and the injustice of their leaders .
Unfortunately , this phenomenon of fundamentalist religious indoctrination , together with lack of education and feelings of injustice , oppression and inequality lends itself to the fomentation of extremism , just as it does in any culture , especially a form of extremism which lashes out both at domestic despotism and foreign control and support of that same despotic rule .
Using fundamentalist theology to manipulate desperate minds experiencing desolate , unfulfilled lives , radical men of Islamic faith reach out to the many whose lives have been castrated by leaders supported by the Empire .
Radicalism in the Middle East , born of frustration , oppression and lack of opportunity , growing due to inequality , unfairness , injustice and persecution , nurtured by a corrupted and hijacked interpretation of modern Islamic faith , and manifesting itself through violent acts of terrorism , is a symptom of the disease called market colonialism , of an imperialism that cares nothing for people living in misery and perpetual suffering , where the west props up and supports and finances its cadre of despots and tyrants in the region , with their full array of crimes against humanity being protected by the Empire itself , at the expense of the native populations , in order to control the region ’s , and the world ’s , most valuable resource .
Turning to Islamic extremism , then , is a symptom of anger , of hopelessness , of the presence of the Empire itself .
Islamic fanaticism , like its American , and Christian counterpart , thrives on the disenfranchised , the downtrodden , the ignorant , and in those searching for meaning to lives heavy in suffering and pain .
Like all forms of fanaticism , the Islamic variety grows and thrives by listening to the angry and the oppressed , providing answers and solutions that help maintain a semblance of understanding in a cruel world .
It is those who have become easily manipulated and easily deceived that fanaticism aims to reach , for in these lost souls new , molded flames can be lit .
Thus , by combining the fanaticism all theologies possess with the living , walking carcasses left behind by America ’s propped up tyrants and kings , gorging on the spoils of oil , too greedy to share with their people , together with American interference in the region , a grassroots resistance is birthed that finds solace and solutions in the beliefs of the past , thinking , rightly , that the devastation of their lives is a result of modernity –albeit a debased form of it – and its corruption by authoritarians sponsored by the west .
Deceived by extremism to hate all things western , because the root of their ills is indeed a product of the western world , they fail to see the reality that true fault lies not in western progressiveness , which is humanitarian , communal and universal in nature , but in the despotic character and oppressive policies of leaders that will not free their subjects to the great virtues of real democracy .
Here , America and her puppet allies in the region have made a vital and egregious error , for in inducing high levels of indigence , uneducation and dissatisfaction , in allowing despotism to rule and the voice of the people to disappear , thereby creating a Molotov cocktail of anger and resentment aimed at the Empire and Arab leaders , they have fostered instability and resistance , some in the form of anti-Americanism , some in the form of terrorism , most in the form of a society that grows more eager for change every year .
Together with a perception that America has embarked on a Crusade of Surge and Siege against the Muslim world , and that her armies are engaging in mass murder and destruction of Muslim peoples , the only avenue for change is being found inside the mosques of radical ideology .
Error Personified
Instead of giving Middle East populations a larger share of the oil bonanza pie ; instead of decreasing the verticality of the hierarchical pyramid , thus making society more just , fair and equal , with better standards of living , better education and more progressiveness ; instead of allowing the Empire a just , balanced and reduced access and control to oil ; instead of banning the pillage of revenues and resources , where capital benefits only the elite ; instead of investing in enlightened education , helping to bring out of darkness millions of minds ; instead of using oil revenues and investing in the wellbeing of their people ; instead of halting billion dollar purchases in the west ’s defense industry , amassing arms for wars that will never come , using weapons sales to funnel petro dollars back to the Empire ; instead of alleviating hardship , resentment and anger ; instead of sponsoring freedom and liberty and greater rights ; instead of abiding by and protecting human rights ; instead of encouraging an open , democratic society , the American amalgam of dictators , tyrants , kings , princes , sheiks and generals have done the complete opposite , thereby cementing in stone continued resistance , continued acts of terror , continued anti-Americanism and continued efforts to violently overthrow the region ’s rulers .
In order to suppress , repress and control those elements seeking to bring down the region ’s tyrannical regimes , the leaders of these states have created a ruthless police state based on oppression , fear , intimidation and paranoia .
To combat the anger prevalent in the population , America ’s puppets must enhance a surveillance and spying society , creating a police state that has perfected the art of despotic rule .
Torture , disappearances , the evisceration of human rights , unlawful arrests , persecution and false imprisonment are but some of the weapons used by these rulers .
Yet the Empire maintains firm support of these leaders , a fact not lost on the population at large .
Right to assembly , right to free speech , freedom of the press , the right of habeas corpus , the right to a fair trial , the right of due process and of protections against unreasonable search and seizure are freedoms not afforded to the peoples of the Middle East .
These are freedoms and rights America does not care to ask or demand of its puppets .
Free elections and the will of the people are but hollow dreams that cannot be given to the masses , for if allowed to vote , tyrants and kings and dictators and generals would be thrown out .
To the Empire , democracy is only democracy when the people elect America ’s chosen leaders , her new puppet upgrade .
If the masses elect someone other than America ’s champion , democracy becomes null and void , the will of the people become obsolete and collective punishment becomes policy , and state - sponsored terror .
To the Empire , democracy is valid only when fraud or theft returns to power her most loyal and obedient proctors .
The people of the Middle East do not hate the Empire for its freedom and liberties , nor for its way of life .
On the contrary , they would love the same freedoms and liberties , the same respect for human rights , and perhaps a better standard of living than they presently enjoy .
They hate the Empire for its transgressions in the region , for its continued support for tyranny , for its hypocrisy in talking democracy and systemically supporting despotism , for its rape and pillage of both land and people , for its addiction to oil that has brought nothing but ruin to the people of the region , for its one - sided support for Israel and its apartheid and state - sponsored terrorism in Palestine , for its genocide and destruction of Iraq and its people , for promising Afghan reconstruction but only succeeding in furthering a decline to a failed state , for its quite obvious indifference to the misery and suffering of Arab and Muslim peoples , for its continued Crusade of Surge and Siege that only threatens to engulf the region in flames and further decimate the lives of millions .
Democracy and freedom cannot prosper in these conditions , for despotic rule and free societies are mutually exclusive .
In fact , the populations of these nations have very few , if any , freedoms and rights to speak of , and millions are handcuffed to the heavy handed rules and regulations of the state , many of which resemble those of the Middle Ages .
When democracy is spoken of , it represents illusions and mirages , not the will of the people , but the charades of the elite .
In the Middle East , democracy is a whispered demand , yet an unfulfilled reality .
It remains a dream of millions , and an enemy of the few .
In the Middle East of reality , and not that of American fiction , tyranny dominates and democracy is nonexistent and all the while , American hypocrisy festers in the mind of the disillusioned .
Of course the United States is fully aware of the methods used by its tyrants to control the population , yet the support , whether diplomatic , financial and militarily , is as constant as it is unwavering .
This tacit support of tyranny by the Empire , even when it speaks of bringing freedom and democracy , speaks of the high level of hypocrisy and duplicity inherent in the Empire .
That American sponsored tyranny has catapulted the region into backwardness , that it has furthered the evolution of fanaticism , that it has given rise to resistance and terror , that it has made impotent the infinitesimal attempts at building democracy , and that it has created decades of suffering , poverty , oppression and lost opportunity can only be denied , as it usually is , inside the Empire itself .
Inside the fires of imperialism , that is to say inside the Middle East , this truth is well known , and understood .
That human beings resent despotism and tyranny is a self - evident truth ; that they build resistance and resentment to colonial machinations and imperialist assaults on their lives is earthly reality .
That most human beings want simply the opportunity to pursue life , liberty and happiness without barriers or hindrances or the control of the state is an absolute manifestation of who we are .
To be human – and yes , the people of the Middle East are , in fact , human – is to seek and want justice , fairness , equality and fundamental human rights .
It is to fight oppression and stand for dignity and honor .
What we abhor as a species are illegal , aggressive invasions and brutal occupations of innocent states , exploitations and repression of the individual and criminality and mass murder that is allowed to transpire and go unaccountable .
What the people of the Middle East want is exactly what the western world already has .
What they want is freedom from imperialism , freedom from tyranny , freedom to exploit their own resources , for their own benefit , for their present and future generations .
What they seek is a chance to be human at the dawn of the 21st century .
What they ask is that they be seen the same as any other person in this planet , possessing the same emotions , fears and opinions , the same behaviors and desires .
What they seek is the empathy and understanding for the lives they must endure , the tyranny they must live under and the Crusade of Surge and Siege the Empire has imposed on them .
So close your eyes , contemplate reality and not spoon - fed fantasy , envision and empathize , try to understand alien pain and suffering , put yourself in the shoes of the millions being strangulated by the Empire , and prepare to enter the fires of imperialism .
According to Klee Kleber , Segway ’s vice president for marketing , the new models have a technology called LeanSteer , which enables the vehicle to intuit whether the rider wants to go left or right .

Segway
“ We ’ve taken that last piece of conventional user experience ” — a steering wheel — and “ replaced it with the magic that existed elsewhere in the product , ” said Mr. Kleber .
In its first incarnation , Segway had movement controls for backward and forward only .
Now , he said , the riding experience is “ very fluid .
You lean whichever direction you want to go . ”
The new Segways also come with a wireless controller , resembling a big digital watch , that allows a user to turn the vehicle on from a distance .
In addition to keeping tabs on a rider ’s speed and mileage , the device has an alarm that notifies the owner when someone else steps on the vehicle .
“ It would beep or squawk , ” Mr. Kleber said .
Though Segway , which is privately held , does not disclose exact sales figures , Mr. Kleber said sales had climbed about 50 percent a year , with “ tens of thousands ” of vehicles sold around the world .
He noted that 40 percent of sales had been to commercial buyers , including tour guide companies and police departments .
Despite the Segway ’s environmental benefits , getting individuals to buy the vehicle remains a challenge , said Mr. Kleber .
