The bellicosity was missing , but the spirit of Col. Nathan Jessup was alive and well at last week ’s Senate Armed Services Committee ’ hearing .
The purpose of the hearing was to determine the origin of policies which legitimized the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Torture at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ?
Yeah , Jessup was definitely there .
The hearing was spurred by revelations of previously classified documents which confirmed that the torture of those imprisoned by the military was not the spontaneous act of a few demented junior enlistees .
The paper trail led all the way back to the White House , and the resulting program of abuse and torture led retired General Antonio Taguba , who investigated similar abuses at Abu Ghraib to conclude that the Bush Administration had engaged in " a systematic regime of torture . "
During eight hours of questioning , various defense department personnel subjected the Committee to their own form of torture .
Speaking in acronyms , half truths and passing - the - buck replies , the DOD witnesses spun in circles those seeking to get to the bottom — or should we say the top — of the torture scandal .
" I ’m sorry Senator you would have to ask BEEBOP Command within Central One at SIXPACK REDRIVE . "
Huh ?
Oh yeah , let ’s not forget this timeless gem : I ’m sorry Senator , I am trying very hard to answer your question , but that was six years ago and I really have no recollection of that . "
In listening to the Senators ’ incredulous follow - ups you had the clear impression that they had no idea what the heck these witnesses were talking about .
It was the DOD ’s version of the hear - no - evil , see - no - evil , speak - no - evil monkeys .
Predictably , lawyers from the Department of Defense expressed indignation at the Senators ’ suggestions that they may have crossed any lines .
In Jessup - like fashion they deviated from direct questions in part to avoid answering them and in part to provide long lectures about terrorism , terrorists and the need to defend the country through the use of " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
The implication was clear .
The determination of how badly detainees can be abused is a matter of national security and only the military — not some namby - pamby Senators or U.S citizens — are smart enough to make that decision .
Taguba has concluded that " There is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes .
The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account . "
" Taguba !
You make me puke !
You want the truth ?
You ca n’t handle the truth ! "
No , and frankly , neither can the rest of us .

Politically Correct Unix
In order for UNIX ( tm ) to survive into the nineties , it must get rid of its intimidating commands and outmoded jargon , and become compatible with the existing standards of our day .
To this end , our technicians have come up with a new version of UNIX , System VI , for use by the PC - that is , the " Politically Correct . "
Politically Correct UNIX ( tm ) System VI Release notes
Utilities :
" man " pages are now called " person " pages .
Similarly , " hangman " is now the " person_executed_by_an_oppressive_regime . "
To avoid casting aspersions on our feline friends , the " cat " command is now merely " domestic_quadruped . "
To date , there has only been a UNIX command for " yes " - reflecting the male belief that women always mean yes , even when they say no .
To address this imbalance , System VI adds a " no " command , along with a " - f[orce ] " option which will crash the entire system if the " no " is ignored .
The bias of the " mail " command is obvious , and it has been replaced by the more neutral " gendre " command .
The " touch " command has been removed from the standard distribution due to its inappropriate use by high - level managers .
" compress " has been replaced by the lightweight " feather " command .
Thus , old information ( such as that from Dead White European Males ) should be archived via " tar " and " feather " .
The " more " command reflects the materialistic philosophy of the Reagan era .
System VI uses the environmentally preferable " less " command .
The biodegradable " KleeNeX " displaces the environmentally unfriendly " LaTeX " .
Shell Commands :
To avoid unpleasant , medieval connotations , the " kill " command has been renamed " euthanise . "
The " nice " command was historically used by privileged users to give themselves priority over unprivileged ones , by telling them to be " nice " .
In System VI , the " sue " command is used by unprivileged users to get for themselves the rights enjoyed by privileged ones .
" history " has been completely rewritten , and is now called " herstory . "
" quota " can now specify minimum as well as maximum usage , and will be strictly enforced .
The " abort ( ) " function is now called " choice ( ) . "
Terminology :
> From now on , " rich text " will be more accurately referred to as " exploitive capitalist text " .
The term " daemons " is a Judeo - Christian pejorative .
Such processes will now be known as " spiritual guides . "
There will no longer be a invidious distinction between " dumb " and " smart " terminals .
All terminals are equally valuable .
Traditionally , " normal video " ( as opposed to " reverse video " ) was white on black .
This implicitly condoned European colonialism , particularly with respect to people of African descent .
UNIX System VI now uses " regressive video " to refer to white on black , while " progressive video " can be any color at all over a white background .
For far too long , power has been concentrated in the hands of " root " and his " wheel " oligarchy .
We have instituted a dictatorship of the users .
All system administration functions will be handled by the People 's Committee for Democratically Organizing the System ( PC - DOS ) .
No longer will it be permissible for files and processes to be " owned " by users .
All files and processes will own themselves , and decided how ( or whether ) to respond to requests from users .
The X Window System will henceforth be known as the NC - 17 Window System .
And finally , UNIX itself will be renamed " PC " - for Procreatively Challenged .
UNIX ( tm ) is a trademark of UNIX System Laboratories .
Any similarty of names or attitudes to that of any person , living or dead , is purely coincidental .
For those who want to have a perfect body or are interested in bodybuilding or are bodybuilders in making here is something interesting .
Whether you want to increase muscle hardness , improve mass , strength & endurance or want to become massive & chiseled like well - known bodybuilders , bodybuilding is the thing you need .
The techniques of bodybuilding can be used by anyone who wants to improve their body or appearance or want to add a bit of size & definition to their structure .
It involves a lot of weight training & you need to remember if you want to look like a professional body builder then you need to be prepared to work like one & which means spending many hours in gym .
Then again some of these bodybuilders use certain substances which gives them the needed muscle mass , but in the long run it wont be of any good as it comes along with it own draw backs .
Kim Chizevsky .
The above six images seem to be shopped , but we are n't so sure .
If you go by our opinion then we would say shopped .
To increase the apparent size of some muscles , some bodybuilders use SEO , a liquid substance , usually a mixture of oils which has only cosmetic effect on the muscle & there is no increase in muscular performance due to its usage .

Is it a spoof ?
Who cares , it ’s funny because it ’s true , ha .
Europe needs Russian oil
The future supply of Russian oil is threatened by a likely decline in production levels , one of the country 's top oil executives has warned .
Lukoil 's Leonid Fedun said $ 1 trillion would have to be spent on developing new reserves if current output levels were to be maintained .
Recent figures show Russian output fell 1 % in the first quarter of 2008 .
The possibility of less oil from one of the world 's key suppliers will add more pressure to prices now at record highs .
Russian peak ?
The surprise fall in Russian oil output in the first part of the year has raised fears about the ability of global supply to keep pace with demand over the next decade .
Russian production averaged 10 million barrels a day in the first three months of 2008 , according to the International Energy Agency , down 1 % on the same period last year .
Blamed on supply problems in western Siberia and weather conditions making it harder to move drilling equipment , the fall contrasts with substantial output rises in recent years .
Russia is not going to be a very reliable supplier of energy in a few years
Mikhail Kroutikhin , Russian Petroleum Investor
Oil prices hit fresh highs
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , Lukoil vice president Leonid Fedun cast doubt on whether output could continue to increase .
Once highly - productive fields in Siberia are slowly being exhausted and the huge cost of searching for oil in the untapped but remote region of eastern Siberia has deterred firms .
" When the well 's productivity falls , you have to keep drilling more and more , " Mr Fedun said , referring to the steady depletion of older fields .
" You have seen it in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico and now you are seeing it in Siberia . "
Analysts at Citigroup recently said annual increases in Russian output could " no longer be taken for granted " but argued that production was expected to rise until 2012 .
One energy expert said the Russian industry was now acknowledging a crisis which had been evident to independent observers for several years .
" We now see production peaked last year , " Mikhail Kroutikhin , editor in chief of the Russian Petroleum Investor told the BBC .
" I believe the decline will continue for quite a number of years . "
Knock - on effects
The problems have been caused by high tax levels and a shortage of financial incentives to invest in exploration , he added .
Russian worries underline longstanding concerns about whether there is enough oil to meet the needs of the global economy , particularly fast - growing China and India .
They are also a particular cause of concern for several of Europe 's largest economies , such as Germany , which buy a large share of their oil from Russia .
" Russia is not going to be a very reliable supplier of energy in a few years , " Mr Kroutikhin warned .

VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - A couple has been arrested in what Canadian police said on Tuesday was an apparent offer to sell a seven - day - old baby girl on Craigslist for C$ 10,000 ( $ 10,100 ) .
A woman who saw the offer on the popular website alerted police who tracked down the 23 - year - old mother and 26 - year - old father using a cell phone number that was listed in the advertisement .
Vancouver police said the couple told investigators the offer was a hoax , but were arrested for public mischief with other criminal charges possible as the investigation continues .
“ There are so many questions here , ” Constable Tim Fanning told reporters .
Police said the advertisement described the baby as “ very cute ” and “ unexpected ” and that its parents , who could not afford to care for it , wanted to give it a good home .
The child was put in the care of social workers .

Concerned parents and disgusted Internet elitists often criticize teenagers for their use of abbreviated speech and shorthand online , frequently arguing that it is ruining their language skills .
It turns out that 's not the case , however , according to new research from the University of Toronto to be published in the spring 2008 issue of American Speech .
In fact , not only is " IM speak " not destroying anyone 's language skills , it is actually being characterized as " an expansive new linguistic renaissance . "
Researchers Sali Tagliamonte and Derek Denis studied over a million words from IM communications and compared it to more than 250,000 spoken words of those between the ages of 15 and 20 .
The two found that , while written and spoken speech share some similarities , IM communications actually leaned toward the formal side .
Teens were more likely to say " She was like , ' oh no you did n't ! ' " when speaking to one another , but write " She said , 'oh yes I did ! ' " when IMing .
( And then I was like " nuh uh ! " )
Teenage IMers do n't abbreviate nearly as much as some might think , either , Tagliamonte and Denis found .
Only 2.4 percent of IM speak vocabulary consisted of things like " LOL " and " OMG , " which the researchers described as " infinitesimally small . "
( Your experience on the Ars Technica IRC channels may vary . )
Additionally , teens seemed to prefer " you " over " u " a whopping 90 percent of the time , with younger users being more likely to use the shortened language .
" Everybody thinks kids are ruining their language by using instant messaging , but these teens ' messaging shows them expressing themselves flexibly through all registers , " Tagliamonte said in 2006 after completing the research for the paper .
" They actually show an extremely lucid command of the language .
We should n't worry . "
The finding fits with earlier research by University of Maryland Baltimore County 's Jeffrey Campbell , which found that people using IM do n't lose their ability to spell .
IM users apparently recognize and often correct errors in their messages , although their self - correction was less accurate than correction by an independent proofreader .
IM speak is n't without its critics , however .
Ireland 's State Examination Commission believes that IM speak does hurt kids ' use of phonetic spelling and punctuation ( or lack thereof ) , although it appears as if the examiner 's complaints are merely based off of observation and some loose correlation between the quality of the students ' work and the rise in text messaging 's popularity .
The truth could , in fact , fall somewhere in the middle .

Phoenix Returns Treasure Trove For Science
June 26 , 2008 -- NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander performed its first wet chemistry experiment on Martian soil flawlessly yesterday , returning a wealth of data that for Phoenix scientists was like winning the lottery .
" We are awash in chemistry data , " said Michael Hecht of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , lead scientist for the Microscopy , Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer , or MECA , instrument on Phoenix .
" We 're trying to understand what is the chemistry of wet soil on Mars , what 's dissolved in it , how acidic or alkaline it is .
With the results we received from Phoenix yesterday , we could begin to tell what aspects of the soil might support life . "
" This is the first wet - chemical analysis ever done on Mars or any planet , other than Earth , " said Phoenix co-investigator Sam Kounaves of Tufts University , science lead for the wet chemistry investigation .
About 80 percent of Phoenix 's first , two - day wet chemistry experiment is now complete .
Phoenix has three more wet - chemistry cells for use later in the mission .
" This soil appears to be a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in Antarctica , " Kouvanes said .
" The alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking .
At this specific location , one - inch into the surface layer , the soil is very basic , with a pH of between eight and nine .
We also found a variety of components of salts that we have n't had time to analyze and identify yet , but that include magnesium , sodium , potassium and chloride . "
" This is more evidence for water because salts are there .
We also found a reasonable number of nutrients , or chemicals needed by life as we know it , " Kounaves said .
" Over time , I 've come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about Mars is not that it's an alien world , but that in many aspects , like mineralogy , it 's very much like Earth . "
Another analytical Phoenix instrument , the Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) , has baked its first soil sample to 1,000 degrees Celsius ( 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Never before has a soil sample from another world been baked to such high heat .
TEGA scientists have begun analyzing the gases released at a range of temperatures to identify the chemical make - up of soil and ice .
Analysis is a complicated , weeks - long process .
But " the scientific data coming out of the instrument have been just spectacular , " said Phoenix co-investigator William Boynton of the University of Arizona , lead TEGA scientist .
" At this point , we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past .
We do n't know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region , or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust . "
Leslie Tamppari , the Phoenix project scientist from JPL , tallied what Phoenix has accomplished during the first 30 Martian days of its mission , and outlined future plans .
The Stereo Surface Imager has by now completed about 55 percent of its three - color , 360 - degree panorama of the Phoenix landing site , Tamppari said .
Phoenix has analyzed two samples in its optical microscope as well as first samples in both TEGA and the wet chemistry laboratory .
Phoenix has been collecting information daily on clouds , dust , winds , temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere , as well as taking first nighttime atmospheric measurements .
Lander cameras confirmed that white chunks exposed during trench digging were frozen water ice because they sublimated , or vaporized , over a few days .
The Phoenix robotic arm dug and sampled , and will continue to dig and sample , at the ' Snow White ' trench in the center of a polygon in the polygonal terrain .
" We believe this is the best place for creating a profile of the surface from the top down to the anticipated icy layer , " Tamppari said .
" This is the plan we wanted to do when we proposed the mission many years ago .
We wanted a place just like this where we could sample the soil down to the possible ice layer . "

I previously made a little proof - of - concept web chat using MochiWeb ( the MochiMedia toolkit to build HTTP servers ) .
The conclusion was ; I still had to explore different fields like :
the management of multiple rooms ;
the informations about who joined and left ;
and the history .
And it ’s what I did recently , there is a screencast ( but no source code this time because there is too much work in progress in it ) .
The big task was to enrich the data format with nick names , informational messages ( rename , join and leave ) and multiple rooms .
That was only adding more complexity to the backend and front end site a little step forward .
The major thing I did is offering a history of the messages .
To go that way , there is obviously a need of having , somewhere , a storage infrastructure .
Erlang has Mnesia ( which is used by Erlycomet and Twoorl ( for handling sessions ) ) .
Mnesia is a distributed storage system either in memory or on disk with 4 different way of managing datas ( as key / value pairs ) .
One of them is exactly how Memcached works , unsurprisingly .
But I did n’t choose Mnesia because I wan’t my data to be accessed from outside the Erlang world and having a query interface avoids a lot of extra work .
My work comet chat was built using web.py and memcached and it quickly became over complicated .
So , CouchDB , the rising star , which according to this video presentation by Jan Lehnardt solves the replication limitations MySQL have ( yes , the slave - master thing ) by saying that everyone is a gentlemen that knows how to deal with conflicts .
The other thing I really heart about CouchDB is that you put in it whatever you want and have only to deal with that when you query them : store and do n’t care .
To access CouchDB data from MochiWeb server , I used the very fresh eCouch library ( formerly OTP application ) released as an Open Source project by the tarpipe team .
Grab it and test , it ’s very simple .
$ curl http://localhost:5984/ { " couchdb " : " Welcome " , " version " : " 0.7.3a " } $ erl - pa ebin / Erlang ( BEAM ) emulator version 5.6.2 [ source ] [ async - threads:0 ] Eshell V5.6.2 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > inets:start ( ) . ok 2 > application : start ( ecouch ) . ok 3 > ecouch : db_list ( ) .
{ok , [<<" test_suite_db " >>,<<" test_suite_db_a " >> , <<" test_suite_db_b " >>,<<" chat " > > ] } 4 > ecouch : db_info(" test_suite_db " ) .
{ok , {obj , [ {" db_name " , <<" test_suite_db " >>} , { " doc_count " ,0} , { " doc_del_count " ,0} , { " update_seq " , 21} , { " compact_running " , false} , { " disk_size " , 14830} ] }} 5 > ecouch : view_access ( " chat " , " messages " , " all " , [ {count , 1} ] ) .
{ok , {obj , [ {" total_rows " , 18} , { " offset " , 0} , { " rows " , [ {obj , [ {" id " , <<" 08ae6beaeca9a0509ef838dce9d4303d " >>} , { " key " , <<" 2008-06-10T07:30:44.0781 Z " >>} , { " value " , {obj , [ {" _id " , <<" 08ae6beaeca9a0509ef838dce9d4 " ...>>} , { " _rev " , <<" 3175880002 " >>} , { " type " , <<" info " >>} , {" posted_at " , <<" 2008-06-10T07:30 " ...>>} , { " message " , <<" Guest joined " >>} , { " room " , < <" Welcome " >>} ]
}} ] } ] } ]}} 6 > q ( ) .
ok
So inside MochiWeb , make sure inets : start ( ) is ran somewhere in your application ( near mochiweb : start appears to be a good idea and working for me ) and ecouch has to be added to the applications that yours relies on ( yours.app .
CouchDB also introduced a complete map / reduce API .
If you tried it a while ago , it ’s worth a second look .
I.e. map is know called emit , so any examples using map are outdated .
I do n’t know if MochiWeb alone is enough to fit all the development needs a normal project has .
I ’ll investigate the creation of less Ajaxy pages like browseable and searchable chat archives , user profiles , OpenID authentication and so on .
Many people are discussing about creating combinaison of different languages , but if I look at Twoorl ( powered by ErlyWeb ) it does n’t seem to need any other languages / framework to rock .
If the fruit of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 has n’t landed in your bank account yet , it ’s likely just a matter of time before you ’re throwing $ 600 on the bed just to see what it feels like to roll around in that much cash .
The government , of course , hopes that we wo n’t just pay bills or sock it away in savings but that we ’ll circulate the money back into the marketplace and thereby jump - start our sagging economy .
As I write , the government is also engaged in another kind of largesse , literally printing money and offering it to banks and government - backed mortgage players Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to stave off the continuing ripple effects of the credit crisis .
Leaving aside whether those moves will reverse the current economic slump , the question is :
Why do we think they might ?
The answer may be found in a new science called evolutionary economics .
This discipline looks at the economy as an ever - changing , complex adaptive system — not unlike that of biological evolution .
Immune systems , language , the law , and the Internet are all examples of other complex adaptive systems .
They learn and grow from the bottom up .
Individual elements ( organisms in evolution , people in economics ) interact and adapt to changing conditions .
These systems are so intricate that they often look as though they ’ve been designed from the top down .
So our minds naturally infer the existence of an intelligent designer for complex life and a government designer for complex economies .
This is why we instinctually look to Fed chairman Ben Bernanke , Treasury secretary Henry Paulson , or Congress and the President to fix the economy .
But there ’s more to it than that .
Both evolution and the economy are autocatalytic , which means they each contain self - driving feedback loops .
In evolution , an arms race between predators and prey is a type of feedback loop where , for example , antelopes will get faster in their efforts to escape leopards that in turn will increase leopards ’ running speeds or else they wo n’t survive as a species .
Similarly , when there is a positive news story about the economy , it causes people to buy more stocks , which drives the stock market higher , thereby stimulating the economy even more .
That , of course , triggers more people to jump into the market , fueling further economic growth , and round and round the loop goes — until it goes bust .
That thrusts the economy into a negative feedback loop , not unlike the situation when species become endangered because they can’t adapt rapidly enough in a changing environment .
Think polar bears in a warming Arctic .
In biological evolution , variation is produced by random genetic mutations and the mixing of parental genes .
These produce characteristics that are naturally selected by the criteria of survival and reproduction .
Out of this process emerge complex and diverse life - forms .
In economic evolution , we generate variation by producing numerous permutations of countless products .
Customers then opt for the products they deem most desirable , “ selecting ” those with the features they want .
Technology format wars are a particularly apt example : VHS over Betamax , DVD over VHS , HD DVD over DVD , and now Blu-ray over HD DVD .
Those products that are purchased “ survive ” and “ reproduce . ”
Just as the naturalist Charles Darwin showed how complex design and ecological balance are unintended consequences of competition among organisms , the economist Adam Smith demonstrated how national wealth and social harmony are unintended consequences of competition among people .
So , again , why do we desire — indeed , demand — top - down interventions into the economy when it stumbles ?
When I wrote things nobody tells you about the south pole , I had never been there .
I 'd read about it and seen pictures of it .
Because I 'd been a member of the U.S. Antarctic Program for a number of years I knew a lot of people who had been to Pole , worked there , and spent the entire winter there .
I also attended the SPUC meeting ( South Pole User 's Committee ) in Denver , so I was very familiar with polar operations and pole science and the stories that the denizens of Pole are wont to tell .
I shared that information with you in that write - up .
But you know how it is .
People write stories about places they 've never been or people they 've never met , and it 's all a sort of mental fiction .
Do n't get me wrong .
It 's perfectly legitimate .
You do n't have to have been to a New Orleans brothel to write a completely truthful and interesting story about one .
But people like reading stories in first person .
They like to know the person who 's writing has had the experience , and so when they climb into his brain they can do a " Being John Malkovich " on the guy , see through his eyes , and then hitchhike home from the Linden exit of the New Jersey Turnpike * .
I had been all over Antarctica but in my five ice years there was never a reason for me to go to the south pole until November of 2005 .
I spent a week at Pole in November , and two weeks between January and February of 2006 .
Now I have a deeper understanding of the south pole and Pole station .
My prior article contained nothing but the truth as I either read it or it was told to me by ice people .
I claim it is valid and will not retract a word .
But as an experienced man I now can offer my accounts in first person .
Pole Station
There is a south pole , and there is a Pole station .
They are separate and distinct .
The south pole of the earth is a geographic feature noted by cartographers .
It is an abstract concept .
One can stand at the south pole of the earth , and anywhere for a couple hundred miles around the south pole of the earth , and for all intent and purposes you could be at the same place .
It 's flat and white and frigid and arid and the air is thin everywhere on the polar plateau .
A human cannot locate the south pole using the standard five senses .
Unlike identification of the Grand Canyon or the island of Kauai or Mt. St. Helens , instrumentation is necessary to identify it .
The Pole Station is the material artifact we built in place of the abstract .
We humans identify Pole station as THE south pole , when in fact the station is an icon .
The current Pole station is owned and operated by the National Science Foundation of the U.S of A .
One presumes that other countries are perfectly welcome to build a station at the south pole .
There are plenty of territorial claims to Antarctica .
Each claim is a pie-wedge sort of arrangement with the vertex at the pole .
The U.S. recognizes exactly none of these claims , and none of those claimants have either deigned to build a station of their own or complained to the U.S. about the station it has built there .
The U.S. makes no claim to Antarctica , but the U.S. occupies Antarctica to an extent that surpasses all the claimants combined .
The old Pole station *** was housed under a geodesic dome erected by the Seabees in the mid 70's .
It is scheduled for demo ( demolition ) in 2007 .
While there is still some habitation under The Dome , in 2006 it was used mostly as convenient cold storage .
Nobody lives there anymore .
All the offices have been cleared out and moved to the new building , which is about 100 meters due south .
The Dome is nothing more than a windbreak .
The temperature under The Dome is the same as it is outside .
There are five flower - petal shaped openings in the top of The Dome to let out heat and moisture and provide ventilation .
Polies routinely drive things into The Dome .
Everything from snow machines to Ford Econoline vans to Caterpillar D9s .
The air quality under the dome can be about as pleasant as the inside of the Lincoln Tunnel ( or the Monte Bianco tunnel ) during rush hour .
Without the ventilation holes , everything would suffocate .
During the winter , all of the outdoor machinery is retired to storage and the air quality improves , but the temperature under The Dome remains at ambient .
The Dome provides protection from the weather .
When The Dome was The Station people lived and worked under it within a set of buildings that look like refrigerated shipping containers .
In fact , they were a sort of " inside out " refrigerator .
The thing about a refrigerator is that it can keep out the cold about as well as it can lock it in .
Going inside one of these bright orange buildings one closed a thick meat locker door behind himself .
It was as if closing the door to a giant refrigerated storage facility that just happened to be the entire world .
People routinely moved between buildings under The Dome .
The galley was in one building , and the berthing in another .
The science labs in still another .
So one was always going " outside " , where outside could mean temperatures in excess of - 90 F in the winter .
Consequently , people were always prepared for the cold which is a logical state for people who live at the south pole .
Walking around inside the dome facility buildings one has the impression of having gone down into one 's brother - in - law 's massive " finished " basement .
Lighting was entirely artificial .
There are no windows anywhere , and the ceiling is low .
The floor is decidedly colder than just a few inches above .
For the last 30 + years people working at the pole lived in and loved conditions at The Dome .
It was special to be there .
Conditions at the new station are less Spartan .
The new station is an elevated multi-level structure with the floor plan of a four - toothed comb .
Inside the atmosphere is spacious .
There are windows everywhere .
The main walkways are all post - modern industrial in design , but the berthing units are quite homey .
There is a VoIP phone and an Ethernet drop in every room .
As long as the satellites are above the horizon ( and they are for 10 hours per day ) , one has T1 quality connectivity and the ability to dial anywhere in the world .
There are carpets .
Each room has an individualized heating control , though as far as I can tell these are placebos designed to lull the occupant into a false sense of atmospheric control .
There is a greenhouse , designed by a guy from University of Arizona , where enough vegetables are growing to feed the entire station a fresh salad at every dinner year round .
There is a library .
There 's a game room and a video room with a 60 " Sony DLP monitor .
There 's an extensive collection of DVDs .
There 's a two - tiered gymnasium with a half - sized basketball court and a regulation height net and backboard .
A running track and weight room .
Galley and sauna .
Machine shop and science lab .
The station can house 200 + people , while the dome only about 50 .
Summer sleeping arrangements at Pole Station include buildings called " Hypertats " and " Jamesways " .
These are older Quonset hut structures , the former with metal / plastic walls and the latter with kapok - filled fabric walls .
In the old days , transients who were only at pole for days or a couple weeks were assigned there , while the more permanent workers slept in berthing under the dome .
Nowadays , folks who are on the lower - rungs of the polar hierarchy are assigned to sleep in these while the scientists and DVs ( distinguished visitors ) all get slots in the new station building .
In stark contrast to McMurdo station , the main U.S. facility on the continent , at Pole everyone gets his own room .
In McMurdo station , everyone has at least one roommate , and can have up to five .
But McMurdo Station is a city in the summer .
There can be up to 1,500 people there , while the max at Pole Station is currently about 230 summer , and 80 have wintered over .
The greater numbers of people bring with it greater social issues .
There 's crime at McMurdo .
Things get stolen .
Broken into .
There are occasional fights .
There is an oppressive , paranoid oligarchy in power that broadcasts safety as its number one priority , while corporate politics is in unmistakable evidence .
McMurdo is sprawling , on the dry land of Ross Island , and quite warm relative to Pole .
One can take walks to interesting things at McMurdo .
There are mountains and a big volcano .
There are hiking trails and places to ski .
There 's even another " town " to go visit -- Scott Base , the New Zealand Antarctic facility is just over the hill at Cape Armitage .
Claustrophobia is never a problem at McMurdo .
At Pole Station , none of that exists .
It 's flat and white .
The community is small and once you 've been there for a few days , people know your name .
Things rarely get stolen .
The community is self - policing .
Everyone takes his own safety as highest priority , the infrastructure only provides support .
The air of self - determination is everywhere .
Living at Pole is vastly different and to me , preferable to living at McMurdo station .
And I ’m told that living in the new station is quite different than life under The Dome .
Unlike The Dome , the new station lacks character and funkiness .
The walls have yet to be covered in cartoons and stolen street signs secreted south within science cargo .
There are no beer stains .
It smells of antiseptic , diesel fumes , and whatever 's currently cooking in the galley .
It 's like staying at a low - end Holiday Inn that happens to be connected to the Student Union at the local university .
One can live inside the station for days , if not weeks , without having to go outside .
Consequently , people walk around the new station completely unprepared to face polar temperatures .
I walked around the station in a t- shirt and jeans wearing Teva sandals .
Long time Polies remarked about how unsafe that is .
At Pole , all resources are limited and subject to breakdown .
While there is triple redundancy on the generators , everything fails in Antarctica .
Were the power to go out , or a fire to start , everyone would need to huddle at an assembly point that involves going outside .
Even in " summer " it can be - 40C / F outside .
Even though I 've done it hundreds of times , it can still take me up to 15 minutes to get dressed for the polar cold .
Not being prepared can kill you , and the new station tends to lull one into a sense of security .
It seems so much like home , and the south pole looks like an artificial diorama from the windows in the galley .
Construction of the new station was managed by a man named Jerry Marty .
Jerry is a cheesehead ( from Wisconsin ) but now makes his home at NSF headquarters in Washington D.C.
He is a tall blonde man with nearly cliche ' " piercing blue " eyes .
Everyone knows he is a Vietnam combat veteran .
An ex-marine with a lust for living that goes beyond occupational motivation .
He helped construct the dome in the 70's .
He 'll receive a piece of it when it 's torn down and shipped to the Seabee museum at Port Huaneme , California .
When you meet Jerry Marty at the south pole he says to you , whether you know him or not : " How 's it going for you ?
Living the dream ? "
The station passed occupational certification in December of 2005 .
People had been living inside it since the first wing was complete in 2003 .
Jerry shrugs at that .
It 's the south pole .
Look outside .
There it is .
Next year the station will be dedicated .
Politicians and scientists will all be present when the giant six - foot tall NSF logo is unveiled on the outside of the station .
Jerry will receive his presidential award for service to his country and then he says he 'll retire .
During his retirement he 'll run in a couple of marathons he 's always wanted to try .
NYC and Boston .
That 's a polie 's retirement .
I felt happy to have met Jerry because he reminded me of what was important .
Where I had been and where I was going were irrelevant .
Every day I woke at the south pole in my low - end Holiday Inn room , with a heating unit I could not control ( but full T1 internet connectivity ) I had to remind myself I was living in a dream .
The south pole .
End of the supply chain .
End of the earth .
A minimum of twelve hours to anywhere by jet .
Break a leg here , you 're going to have to wait till you can get to Christchurch to have it set .
A rescue mission would have to be launched if you had kidney stones .
Develop cancer , they make a movie about you .
It 's very easy to fall into a sense of complacency in the new station .
Very easy to drop your guard and act as if you 're entirely safe .
The south pole becomes just another place .
Another tourist destination .
The age of exploration has past , as we wolf down our pizza and tiramisu we tell our friends back north of grueling hardship and our feats of derring do .
We harken back to the days of manhauling and dog sledding while in stocking feet we pour ourselves another coffee and grab a chocolate - chip cookie from the tray in the galley .
We walk over to the window facing the pole and watch a group of young people outside .
General Assistants , fresh out of college , having their polar adventures .
One by one they strip off all their clothes and pose by the pole marker , imploring their friend with the camera to shoot quick .
And then in Photoshop they superimpose their bodies upon the black and white image of Scott 's doomed party .
Send it back to the real world .
Dear God .
What an awful place .
" Look , ma .
I 'm having an adventure . "
The Weather
Unless records are being broken , the temperature at Pole Station is never above zero degrees Fahrenheit .
Therefore , when one quotes the temps at Pole , it 's unnecessary to say the word " minus " before the number .
So , if it 's - 39 F , one says it 's 39 degrees .
Everyone knows higher numbers mean colder .
Temps at pole range from the 20's and 30's Fahrenheit in the midsummer , to the 100's after midwinter .
The U.S. Air Force rules prohibit their pilots from landing at Pole when the temperatures are below 50 Celsius .
Therefore the summer season at Pole lasts from late October to mid February .
There 's roughly three months of flying , and the rest of the year the station is inhabited by the winter - over crew who works alone and autonomously .
The wind at Pole is not usually very strong .
Unlike McMurdo , they do not have Herbies ( hurricane blizzards ) at the south pole .
And unlike the rest of the world , low barometric pressures signal good weather at pole , and high pressure indicates a coming storm .
The relative humidity at pole is reasonable given the temperature , though we from more temperate climes would all consider there to be no humidity at all .
The pressure altitude at Pole ranges from about 10,000 feet to highs of 12,000 .
That means that even though the actual geographic altitude of Pole station is about 9500 feet , it feels a couple thousand feet higher due to atmospheric conditions .
One can go to sleep at 10,000 feet , and wake up at 11,000 .
The 10 % difference may not seem like much , but if you 're a lowlander , it can be the difference in being able to climb a flight of stairs without becoming winded .
When arriving at the south pole by military transport , the cabin in the plane is pressurized to a lower altitude than the pole itself .
Therefore , when the door to the plane is opened , air escapes .
The traveler suddenly finds himself transported from a cozy 5000 feet to the ambient 10,000 feet .
The physiological effect on someone who lives at sea level is somewhat sudden .
Take a few steps and the heart begins to race .
It feels like you 've been running and have to catch your breath even though you 're standing in place .
Couple that with a blast of frigid air in the face , and the overall impression is of drowning in a frozen lake .
I became light headed .
My ears rang and I saw spots as I trudged with my gear from the skiway to the new station .
For several hours it was an effort to carry on a coherent conversation .
I felt like I had consumed a six - pack of beer in ten minutes .
I had the buzz , the headache , and the nausea to go along with it .
I got into bed to sleep it off and had vivid , bizarre dreams .
My heart pounded in my chest to the point my bed shook in time with my pulse .
This condition is called hypoxia .
The symptoms are caused as a result of oxygen starvation , otherwise known as suffocation .
After about six hours I was able to function like a rational human being .
And after two days the effect was minimized .
After two weeks at pole I felt " normal " , save for the incredible dryness .
I awoke every morning with my mouth and nostrils sere as an Arizona highway in mid-summer .
I had a blistering sinus headache every morning .
My mucous membranes worked overtime and clogged my head and nostrils with material that hardened upon contact to air .
I slept fitfully , in 2 hour increments .
One has to be conscious to drink at least " 8 glasses " of water per day per medical recommendation .
I take this to mean 64 ounces .
I generally drank 2 - 3 liters of water per day , not including what I had at meals .
The effect of this was to cause me to have to urinate every 20 minutes or so .
And for reasons I do not understand , when one has a bodily function to perform at pole , the mind has to work harder to control the body than one does at home .
The body says to the mind : NOW .
MACHT SCHNELL .
PEE .
EAT .
SLEEP .
WAKE .
MOVE , YOU SWINE .
MAO .
It takes a while to get used to the sense of urgency .
Before then , one finds himself bolting to restrooms like a two year old at a birthday party .
Once one is acclimated to the altitude and the cold , the joy of working in polar conditions can be experienced in full .
The human body can judge a wide range of temperatures , but once the limits of perception are exceeded , things are simply very hot or very cold .
For instance , we know well the difference between +40 F and +70 F .
Nobody has to tell us whether or not we need a coat .
But can a person detect the difference between +200 F and +230 F ?
Same temperature difference , but much higher steady state offset .
Anything in the range of boiling water and above is just plain hot and burns .
It works the same way with cold .
I have found I can detect decreasing temperatures down to about - 10 F .
Below that , it feels the same .
So , when you 're inside Pole station and you need to go out , you can go outside through the " beer can " , an enclosed stairway that leads both to the surface and if you keep going down , to a subice tunnel that connects the generator arch to the station .
Inside the beer can , while I was at pole , temperatures were about 20 F .
Outside the temperatures ranged from 60 F to 25 F .
Except for the wind , I could never detect a temperature difference between the inside of the beer can and outside , even though that difference could be as much as 40 F .
However , you could note other interesting effects .
For instance , below 50 F , a gob of spit instantly froze in front of one 's face .
The snow underfoot made strange metallic squeaking sounds at about 60 F .
At 40 F the snow machines would refuse to start .
At 25 F , I had to remove layers of clothing while doing manual work as I would become overheated .
In fact , I dug a trench at 25 F in nothing but my fleece , wind pants , and long underwear .
No hat and only thin glove liners - and I was sweating anyway .
Four days later , at 40 F , I did a similar amount of digging and could n't remove a single layer , did not sweat , and would get cold whenever I stood in one place for a few minutes .
Yet , at all of those temperatures my sense of the cold air against my bare skin was exactly the same .
But those of you who live in Alberta already know that .
Sinkage
Look at pictures of Pole station on the web .
The dome is half buried .
You once had to climb two flights of stairs to get to the front door of the ARO building in the clean air sector .
Now there 's only about four steps .
The entire first flight of stairs and landing are buried .
You can look out the third floor windows of the Skylab building and see ground level .
The two lower floors look out onto the walls of a snow crater .
The building is apparently at the bottom of it .
Off the main entrance to The Dome , to the left and right , are two giant steel arches about fifteen feet high at their apex .
The arches form a Quonset hut style shelter under which are housed heavy machinery , the station generators , and all the fuel needed to run the generators .
In my two visits to pole station , those arches were completely buried .
The entrance to the dome is completely below the surface of the ice .
To get into The Dome one has to descend a ramp .
The entrance was not built underground .
Skylab was not built at the bottom of a crater .
The ARO building stairs were not buried by vandals .
The arches were atop the ice when they were delivered .
I 've asked engineers at Pole station -- " Why are all the buildings sinking ? "
They scratch their heads .
Some say the buildings are not sinking , but rather the entire polar plateau is rising around the buildings .
The snow drifts and piles up around everything .
But other engineers will claim the buildings are settling into the ice .
This is an oddly controversial question .
Is the ice rising around the buildings , or are the buildings are sinking into the ice ?
It seems to me someone should know , and yet no matter how many people I asked , I could n't get a straight answer .
People who should have known spoke in circular logic .
People who did n't know for sure were more certain .
" Well , which is it ? "
" Definitely , the snow is rising .
That 's why everything is on stilts .
To minimize the drifting . "
" OK .
So , if I was to take a GPS reading today , and then another one in five years , I 'd find the entire polar plateau has risen by ten feet or so . "
" Hmm . No . Maybe not .
If you go inside the dome and look at the ground you see it 's bubbled up in the middle .
Like the snow is rising up into the dome itself . "
" Ahh .
I see .
The dome has no floor , so if the walls were sinking , the interior space gets smaller . "
" Well , but it has n't sunk that much .
The bubble is n't that big . "
" So the entire polar plateau has risen by thirty feet ? "
" No . Not necessarily . "
The new pole station was designed by the architectural company , Ferraro and Choi .
It 's modular and on jacks .
The jacks are on top of stilts .
The bottom floor of the building is fifteen or so feet off the snow surface as I write this .
Each section of the four - toothed comb can be raised or lowered individually .
In the third year of construction , the sections they 'd built had sunk so much they had to be jacked up to mate with the new section they built that year .
Engineers said they saw compression ripples around each of the pylons , indicating there was significant pressure .
Well , that was probably expected as the building weighs a bit .
But it was unclear to the engineers whether or not the existing sections had gone down into the ice , or the snow had drifted up in the area around the construction , effectively raising the ice level .
Nobody I spoke with could explain the phenomenon .
I presume some architect somewhere knows the mechanism and can explain it to all of us .
Until then , we 'll all speculate .
Ferraro and Choi are headquartered in the Hawaiian Islands .
Ice Food
Soon after the invention of eating , the Italians emerged as the preeminent cookers of eating stuff .
History is vague on the reasons .
Cooking as a way to provide nourishment had been popular since men started killing things and realized there was only so much mileage one could get out of bloody offal before gastrointestinal distress made berries a better choice .
Somewhere along the line people decided to separate the bodily function and stink of consuming animal - based calories from the conviviality of a firelight dinner , and the Italians , being best at putting on a good party , figured how to do it best .
However it happened , the Greeks and Gauls learned cooking from the Italians and made some adaptations .
By the time the idea of eating arrived in the more northern areas such as the British Isles , the concept had been mutated by the Visigoths and the Germans , which is why fried fish is served in newspaper at Brighton .
As is true in the real world , the Italians make the best food in Antarctica .
The best dining on the continent is to be had at Terra Nova bay and all Antarcticans strive for a boondoggle there .
Invitations are hard to come by as the base is small .
But pasta and wine are served with every meal .
Dining is as crucial to Italian science as sex and Fellini .
The torment of pemmican and Robert F. Scott not withstanding , the worst dining on the continent in modern times is to be found at the Russian base at Vostok .
That is , if anyone has survived .
For humanitarian purposes the United States set up a sister station a couple hundred yards from the Russian outpost at Vostok .
The purpose of this station , apparently , was to provide a pantry for the starving Russians to raid .
The Russian Antarctic program supplies their polarnauts with little more than tinned herring , vodka , and a half pound of moldy potatoes .
There are so few supplies at the Russian base that the cheapest commodity , vodka , is applied liberally to obliterate the polar scientists ' memories .
Whoever can't remember being hungry , does n't need food , is the theory .
It is well documented that a few years ago , the Russian base doctor had to perform an appendectomy on himself using a mirror for lack of sober assistants .
It is rumored the doctor was sloshed when he performed the surgery -- who in their right mind would attempt something like that in a state of absolute sobriety ?
When the Russians come to a U.S. base they tend to stay and play table soccer until they are requested to leave .
Not only is the food remarkably better at the U.S. bases than the Russian bases , but it is actually there , where it tends toward the imaginary side at places like Vostok .
Which brings us to American food .
The best food the USAP supplies on the continent of Antarctica is at Pole .
It 's rumored that occasionally the cooks at Palmer station outdo pole .
Palmer has the advantage being at sea level and at the seashore where the Antarctic treaty can be violated in private while the team dines on breast of kestrel wrapped in freshly caught Antarctic cod .
At pole , the cooks have to deal with the altitude and the supply chain .
There 's nothing natural to consume at the south pole except snow , which is used exclusively in alcoholic beverages and is unappetizing otherwise .
What the Pole cooks do with their supplies is pure art .
I have eaten many meals at McMurdo station , at field camps , and at Pole station , and I can say without hesitation that were I served in an airplane what I have been served at McMurdo I would send it back .
This is not to say the cooks at McMurdo do n't do an excellent job under the circumstances .
Having to prepare four meals per day for 1,200 + people with limited frozen resources is a massive challenge .
And most McMurdoites are happy not to have to eat pemmican .
Just as in the major American penitentiaries , you do n't complain about the food .
Truth is , McMurdo food ranges from airline quality at worst , to big - huge - wedding quality at best .
There are times at McMurdo where you scoop a ladle of something marked - " blazing red fish " onto your plate and other than the fact it appears to resemble something that was once red and quite possibly inorganic , the human ability to identify a substance as edible is terribly challenged .
And then there are moments of pure heaven , such as on cookie day or taco day .
Food at Pole is restaurant quality .
At the very worst one might expect he 's eating in a roadside diner .
At the very best , one might be in an upscale luncheonette in a major city .
I have never been disappointed by a meal at Pole , and I have never failed to go back for seconds .
Now , the upside of life at pole is that those who work outdoors burn upwards of 8000 calories per day .
One burns about 5000 calories per day simply resting and staying warm .
Eating is a big deal in Antarctica , and eating big is important at pole .
The cheesecakes , carrot cakes , chocolate cakes , pies , and cookies are all top flight .
The pizza is decent .
Given it 's the south pole , it 's incredible , but Pole pizza could stand up to California delivered pizza any day .
The Pad Thai is as good as I 've been served in silicon valley , and the soups are hot and sometimes spicy .
One potential negative of Pole galley ambiance is that during the summer , when the station occupation is at its highest , the galley cannot accomodate the entire population simultaneously .
Therefore , people have to eat in " shift " fashion , and signs are posted that no " camping out " is allowed -- meaning , that having cordial conversation after food is consumed is extremely discouraged .
The seats are needed for the next customer .
And during the season I visited pole ( '05 / '06 ) the 90 - South bar had been dismantled and no new meeting place had been erected in its stead .
Therefore , unless one wanted to hoof it across the compound to " summer camp " and the recreation jamesway there , there was simply no place inside Pole station to sit comfortably with people and have a conversation .
I 'm absolutely certain this situation will be rectified in the coming seasons , as the rest of of the station construction is completed .
I give the Pole galley four penguins for ambiance and overall dining experience .
McMurdo gets two .
I give three to the field camp at Lake Hoare .
Rae Spain 's Indian night and Thanksgiving dinner are culinary events worthy of both National Geographic and Food and Wine .
I have never been to a Russian base .
If there are any survivors we can ask if they would accept the quarter penguin I 'd grant their galley purely on evidence of their having been kept alive .
Polies
Polies are a different species of Antarctican and they will remind you of that fact any time the question arises .
Polie winterovers are yet another species , and they too will remind you of the distinction if you have doubts .
What characterizes a polie from any other denizen of the south is the magnification of a couple qualities .
Polies are intensely capable people .
They tend to have been selected from the best of the best of the best .
They 're just as likely to be biplane pilots as concert pianists as operatic sopranos as lion tamers .
They are exceptionally private .
A polie will generally not volunteer any personal information until he or she has known you for a couple years , or lived with you in a jamesway for four or five months straight .
Polies are honest .
There are no locks on any doors at Pole station .
Polies leave their personal gear in random alcoves or on the main hallway floor in the new station .
I have seen valuable leatherman tools left on window sills .
iPods , items of clothing , laptop computers , and briefcases left on chairs in the galley , on bathroom sinks , on staircases , on the floor .
It 's almost as if each is daring the other to abscond with a personal item .
Because there 's nowhere to run at pole .
Polies are all selected specifically to work at Pole and there is nobody there who wants to go home .
So things do n't get stolen , and nobody steals .
This is in stark contrast to McMurdo station , where there are locks on every door and interesting things that are n't nailed down tend to walk .
McMurdoites make a big deal when a theft happens .
It is n't all that frequent , but when it does it disturbs the community .
But the McMurdo community is vast and diverse in terms of people 's motivation .
Not everyone wants to be at McMurdo .
Some people want to go home and can't get out because of contract commitments .
Some people do n't care to be part of the community .
Some people are unhappy with their management .
Whatever the reasons , theft is becoming more common at McMurdo station , while it remains non-existent at Pole .
Polies have much more attitude than McMurdoites .
There 's a certain " status " .
The USAP issues Polies different parkas .
Polies get green and black parkas , whereas the rest of the program is issued either the standard Carhartts or the infamous " big red " parka .
Only Polies can wear the green and black .
I have found Polies to be much more friendly than other Antarcticans , but also much more confrontational .
Where a McMurdoite would simply turn and leave a conversation that did n't interest him , a Polie would blatantly change the subject or challenge the entire premise of the discussion .
Polies are less likely to fear political reprisals .
They tend to be less fearful , in general .
They do not worry .
One day this past February I went out with my colleague to dig a snow trench .
One of the science techs was sent out to work with us .
The location was about a 1/4 mile from the station .
The temp was about - 45 F .
I went out and started digging .
I was in full ECW regalia .
Everything from hyper - insulated bunny boots to two pairs of gloves and four layers of poly pro .
When the Polie science tech arrived , he observed what I was doing and pitched in to help .
Between the two of us , the job was done in a flash .
As I finished he sauntered away and I noticed he was wearing street shoes .
Worn - in , black loafers .
Leather .
Flat heels .
Sides and heel of the shoe broken - in to the point the leather had the consistency of a limp towel .
The man wore loafers to dig a 500 ' long snow trench on the polar plateau .
I said , " Neil .
You 're wearing loafers .
You 're going to get frostbite . "
He smiled and said , " Yeah . "
He 's still down there .
Gifts to the Unwashed Masses
At the end of the lower hallway in the new station , toward the skiway , there 's a display case , mostly empty .
Inside this case are several pole markers .
As I mentioned in Things nobody tells you about the south pole , they make a new one every year .
There 's only about nine of them in there , the oldest dating from the early 80's .
I want to say the other ones are in the Smithsonian , or the Museum of Natural History in New York , or the Field Museum in Chicago , or even the Museum of Round Metal Things in that new suburb of Shanghai , China .
But I have the feeling nobody knows where the other ones are , or rather , they know where they are but they do n't want to have to give them back .
There 's also a framed sweater .
The sweater is olive drab , military issue .
Size medium , I believe .
The plaque in the frame indicates the sweater was worn by Admiral Byrd during his famed first flight over the south pole .
It 's on the bottom shelf of the cabinet .
It sort of looks like skua , and if the heat ever goes out , you can bet it 's going to become skua .
Right above the sweater are two more framed objects .
One is a signed copy of Roald Amundsen 's book about his capturing the south pole .
It bears Roald 's hand - inscribed good wishes to the inhabitants of the south pole station .
The other is a letter from the King of Norway presenting the " Amundsen Award * * " for polar exploration to the inhabitants of the U.S. South Pole station , and wishing the best to all explorers who pass through .
The official name of the South Pole station is : " The Amundsen Scott South Pole Station " even though the station is owned and operated by the U.S .
There are no good wishes from the British in the forelorn display case at the far end of the hallway where nobody goes .
Maybe they do n't want to remember Scott , or perhaps the fact it's not the " Scott Amundsen South Pole Station " bugs them , or maybe they 're just sick and tired of American patronization .
While reviewing these nearly lost items I took my first sip from a thermos cup of Stash brand liquorice spice herb tea .
It had to be the most vile taste I 'd ever experienced within the confines of my own mouth .
I exited the viewing area to dispose of the vile chemical brew within my cup , and only on my plane trip home did I realize that when they dismantled several buildings under the dome the polar powers - that - be had taken these artifacts out of the 90 - South Bar and tossed them in the display case where they would n't get in the way during construction .
Surely , at some point , someone is going to remember that Admiral Byrd 's sweater and Roald Amundsen 's signed tome are both sitting there unobserved and unmolested in the farthest , lowest corner of the station .
Or not .
Polar Sex
Take any group of people .
Isolate them .
Put them under stress .
Sooner or later , as sure as eggs is eggs , some of them will have sex .
It happens irrespective of race , creed , or gender .
Men have sex with men .
Women have sex with women .
Men and women have sex with each other .
We all know this .
Ask anyone who 's done submarine duty .
Ask anyone who 's done a military tour of any kind .
Ask anyone who 's been on an expedition .
People are people and always have been .
At McMurdo the situation is amplified somewhat by the demilitarization of authority .
McMurdoites are , by and large , civilians and governed by civilian law .
While the military has strict rules of conduct , sex by consenting adults is not a crime for civilians .
There are a lot of people at McMurdo , so at any time there are folks of all varieties of disposition and temperament .
So people will consent and sex will be had .
They used to put out big buckets of condoms in the rest rooms on Highway 1 at McMurdo .
Hundreds .
These would tend to disappear slowly during the course of the week , and then vanish entirely on Saturday night .
Over time the powers that be decided too much money was going into simply handing out vast quantities .
They were unsure the condoms were being used for the appropriate purposes .
For instance , fearing shortages , people stockpiled .
And guests would arrive and snarf up handfuls .
Once , the entire bucket disappeared after a cruise ship full of tourists arrived on station one January .
Now one has to go to the clinic and ask the doc in person to receive his or her condoms .
Large quantities are still doled out .
There are big public parties and small private parties after which folks stagger home together .
There are long term romances and short term ones , one - night flings and quickies in tents in the field .
While the station is very public there are hiding places .
Roommates can be sent away .
The horny and industrious always find a way .
For instance , it 's well known that a couple was found in progress inside Ivan the Terrabus .
Ivan is the giant VanHool bus used to ferry passengers between the airstrip and McMurdo station .
The fact Ivan has been " soiled " surprises no one , and inspires jealousy in most .
The offending couple were Raytheon employees , and so subject to dismissal .
They were retro'ed north .
The fact that Ivan is now guarded against such activity means another hiding place has to be taken off the list .
At Pole there are less people .
There are big parties and little parties .
People pair up .
Everyone has a private room so privacy is not as hard to come by .
Though , all the private rooms are in public places .
It 's easy for an observer to know who 's doing whom by simply running into couples emerging from each other 's rooms at various times of the weekend day .
But judging by the condom consumption , I must make the presumption that less is going on in the population than at McMurdo .
The condom dispenser at Pole station in the men's restroom is a small plastic basket -- the kind they put club sandwiches on at the diner .
It 's in a cubby slot in the wall labeled with a dymo strip .
The first day I noticed it was there I saw six condoms in it .
There were six condoms in it all week .
On Sunday morning I noticed there were only four and I bumped into one of the cargo ladies coming out of the room next to mine .
I said good morning to her and then the scientist who followed her out of his room .
There you have the extent of it .
The Jerri Nielsen Affair
The book is called Ice Bound .
It 's written by Dr.Jerri Nielsen and it's the first - person account of her developing breast cancer during a winterover at Pole in the 90's .
It really happened .
She was the winterover doctor and she noticed a lump .
The lump grew .
Through the miracle of telescience , doctors in the Midwest were able to diagnose her cancer and prescribe treatment .
Chemotherapy meds were airlifted into pole near midwinter .
The drugs were administered .
The Air Force guys flew when they were n't " supposed to " and landed at pole long before it was warm enough to be safe and got her out and back to the real world where she underwent a mastectomy , radiation , and further chemo , and now survives to tell the tale .
People at Pole are still fuming .
This is a big polar deal .
Ask anyone on the ice who was around during the adventure and they 'll tell you the same story -- Jerri did n't get it right .
Jerri showboated .
Grandstanded .
Took advantage of people who trusted her .
Violated trust .
Invaded privacy .
Broke promises and codes , unwritten and personal and otherwise .
As far as the ice goes , Jerri is forevermore unwelcome .
If the population has its way , and it almost always does , you wo n't see Jerri Nielsen in Antarctica unless she buys a ticket on a Russian icebreaker .
Sounds kind of harsh .
Did n't this woman develop breast cancer ?
Was n't she the base doc during a winterover and so had to self - medicate without the aid of anesthesia ?
Did n't the whole winterover team band together to save her life ?
Did n't U.S. Air Force personnel risk theirs to get her off station before it was safe to land a plane ?
Woah .
What 's with this ?
Everybody sour grapes ?
Everybody jealous of her $ 25,000 - a- pop speaking engagements ?
Her $ 25,000 - a- hit motivational seminars ?
" This " is an element of Antarctic society that 's a bit difficult to understand unless explained .
And I will explain it in a sentence , and you 'll get it immediately .
Everybody in Antarctica is on the same adventure .
That 's pretty much it .
We all go to the ice to have our adventure .
For some of us , the adventure is sitting in an uncomfortable military plane and disembarking on a vast open field of ice in a landscape so different from home it freezes the heart for a beat or two .
Then we settle into a comfortable existence of custom made omelets , bottled beer , and dances with unfamiliar partners .
In this age of vast telecommunication viewers at home can follow us .
The voyeurism of it is enchanting .
A lot of us write blogs so our friends can follow along as we plod through the cold and the pain .
We 're microstars , existing for days and months in our diluted 15 minutes of fame .
We 're discovering the Buddha in each of us , the God in every man , and that the fundamental nothingness that comprises most of the universe is punctuated only by the warmth of human kindness .
This is our adventure .
Our individualized , collective adventure .
We could write a book about any one of us , or each of us .
We gather up our stories .
We tell them over and over .
Some of us have better connections in the media than others .
Some of us make the news .
Lots of books have been written about people 's adventures on the ice , but none infuriates Antarcticans as much as Jerri's .
And the reason is Hollywood .
The true story of Jerri 's survival on the ice contains two important points omitted from both the book and the made - for - TV movie starring Susan Sarandon .
Point one is that Jerri was not the center of activity during the crisis .
She was the center of attention , but her disability required more of the rest of the polies .
Everyone had to work harder because one of their own was down .
They had to fill in .
They had to learn enough medicine to treat each other .
They had to signal the planes .
They used their ingenuity to develop a system for transmitting medical procedures and microscope images over satellite in real time .
While Jerri succumbed to her pains and treatment , the rest of the team went into overtime keeping her well and keeping itself intact .
In the name of pacing , people were left out of the story .
People who performed heroically and participated in Jerri 's assistance were completely omitted from the text .
Other , " composite " characters were introduced merging the activities and characteristics of several people into one character to make the story move more smoothly .
This happened in movie , where it is practically understandable , but also in the book where it seems inexcusable .
Point number two - and this point was given to me by a professional trained in medicine who was not only there during the situation , but obtained valid analysis by Jerri 's doctors and others - is that Jerri 's condition was not life threatening .
Let 's be clear about this .
The point made by the polies is that had Jerri gone entirely untreated and the planes flew on schedule , she would not have perished from her cancer .
There were months remaining before her condition became untreatable .
She would still have made it back to the north in time for all the procedures she underwent to work .
The feats of heroism that got chemo drugs to her and got her off station ahead of schedule were unnecessary .
In fact , people have had more life threatening injuries at pole , and there the heroism was necessary to save human life .
In Jerri 's case , the big deal that was made gave her a safety margin at the risk of others .
Jerri got sick , and everyone around her risked their lives to save her .
After informally interviewing about ten of the fifty people who were on station at that time , including the station manager , science techs , scientists , and the doctor who came to replace her , I have been able to distill their position to those issues , which to date remain wholly unacknowledged .
Was it her book editor or the screenwriter who excised some of the winterover team members from the story ?
It was probably one of them , and probably not Jerri who did it .
Do the Polies have a right to feel slighted ?
Absolutely .
Offended , insulted ?
Yah .
It was their adventure , too .
If I remember anything about my trips to the ice it's that Antarctica is a continent of pain .
Antarctica hurts people .
It freezes us .
Starves us .
Suffocates us .
Every step is a climb uphill .
The muscles are always burning .
The weather never cooperates .
The lungs and chest are always working hard .
Dust is always in the eyes .
The glare is always too bright , the shadows always too dark .
Equipment always fails and the right tools are never at hand .
And it 's no easier on any one of us than another .
We all experience the same continent and we each survive because we work for each other .
For one of us to profit without acknowledgment of the others is a breach in code of conduct that forms the chain between us and the great men who first set foot here .
To become part of the legacy of the ice means to accept you are one of many .
When Jerri went down with cancer , the whole station went down .
Each of their lives were that much more at risk because the doc was not functioning .
Each of them sweated the diagnoses , and each of them followed her until she got home and recovered .
We can write all the books we want .
Make all the movies we want .
No one person conquered Antarctica .
It has always been done in teams .
Whether it be sponsors supporting an adventurer , or teammates helping each other on the vast flat white , humanity survives the ice in groups .
When we forget this we lose the essence of what makes this kind of adventure rich and compelling .
Then we have surrendered living for fashion .
Then we have given up life for glitz .
In unbelievable egotism we attempt to betray the unbetrayable and in the process we extinguish the very heart of living within ourselves .
There is only life .
We have only each other .
We are all that 's warm and alive in this place .
Scott and Shackelton knew it .
Amundsen faced mutiny because of it .
Mawson knew it .
Evans and Wild and Bowers .
Wilson .
We all face the same hardships .
We all risk the same death gleefully , as if it could n't happen .
The ice is forever .
The adventure belongs to all of us .
The Crime of Severe , Repeated , and Hostile Communication with the Intent to Cause Substantial Emotional Distress ?
That 's what a proposed federal statute -- the Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act , HR 6123 , introduced two weeks ago by Reps. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) and Kenny Hulshof ( R - MO ) -- would create :
Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication , with the intent to coerce , intimidate , harass , or cause substantial emotional distress to a person , using electronic means [ " including email , instant messaging , blogs , websites , telephones , and text messages " ] to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both .
Wow .
So if I harshly criticize Reps. Sanchez and Hulshof ( " hostile " ) at least twice ( " repeated " ) in a way that a jury finds " severe , " whatever that exactly means , and if I do that " with the intent to ... cause substantial emotional distress , " I could go to prison for up to two years .
My criticism could be perfectly accurate .
It could be an expression of my opinion , including on political , social , or religious issues .
The desire to cause substantial emotional distress could be prompted by the target 's reprehensible actions or political views , and could be coupled with a genuine attempt to persuade the public .
Does n't matter :
My actions would be a crime .
This is clearly unconstitutional .
In Hustler v. Falwell , the Supreme Court held that even civil liability for " outrageous " ( not just " severe " ) behavior that recklessly , knowingly , or purposefully causes " severe emotional distress " ( not just " substantial emotional distress " ) violates the First Amendment when it's about a public figure and on a matter of public concern .
Many , though not all , lower courts have held the same whenever the statement is on a matter of public concern , even about a private figure .
I would go further and reject the emotional distress tort altogether whenever it 's premised on the content of speech that falls outside an existing exception , i.e. , speech that is n't threatening , factually false , or the like .
But in any case even the specific holding in Hustler is enough to make the statute facially overbroad .
( Given the Hustler reasoning , the requirement that the speech be electronic , repeated , or intended to cause substantial distress does n't adequately narrow the law : " [ I ] n the world of debate about public affairs , many things done with motives that are less than admirable are protected by the First Amendment ....
[ E ]ven when a speaker or writer is motivated by hatred or ill will his expression was protected by the First Amendment .... " )
Existing telephone harassment laws have their problems in some cases , but at least they limit themselves to one - to - one speech to the person who is being " harassed , " and do n't interfere with the speaker 's ability to communicate with willing listeners in the public at large .
This law has no such limitation .
Its reference to blogs and websites strongly suggests that it deliberately addresses one - to - many publishing media as well as one - to - one email and text messaging -- but even without that reference , it would literally cover any " communication , " with no limitation that the communication be sent specifically to the distressed person .
Appalling .
Imagine what it might have been like to be Dr. Kleenex .
You invent a modern miracle , the cheap paper handkerchief , and suddenly you become the person blamed for America ’s disposable culture , praised for a more convenient life , or both .
There never was a Dr. Kleenex , though  the product was created by a team of researchers at Kimberly - Clark laboratories in the 1920s .
But there is a real Craig in Craigslist , and lately he is looking at life beyond his little list that happens to be the seventh - most - popular Web site in the United States .
It is also a site that is deeply tied up with the fate of newspapers  indeed , many in the newspaper industry blame the site ’s founder , Craig Newmark , for the downturn in their classified - advertising business .
An ardently no -frills , ad - free , user - sensitive site , Craigslist has , by the estimate of its chief executive , Jim Buckmaster , generated more than 600 million free classified listings .
( Though nearly all listings remain free , Craigslist has added modest fees for job listings and real estate brokers in certain big cities , and from those fees the company generates $ 80 million to $ 100 million in annual revenue .
It has a staff of 25 , including Mr. Newmark . )
Kirsten Dunst Did Rehab for Depression Not Addiction
Actressis ready to set the record straight about her stay at Cirque Lodge treatment center in Utah .
First and foremost she wants the world to know that celebrities are not different than anyone else and that " we are all in the same boat . "
The star took her time seeking help , waiting six months before she finally sought help for depression .
In an interview with E ! Kirsten said :
I was struggling , and I had the opportunity to go somewhere and take care of myself .
I was fortunate to have the resources to do it .
My friends and family thought it was a good idea , too .
But I did n't know where to go .
My doctor recommended Cirque Lodge . "
There 's been a lot of misrepresentation about what is going on in my life , and this has been very painful for my friends and family . "
Tired of her family having to always defend her actions , Kirsten now feels like she is able to open up about her situation .
She stated : Wishing continued good health for Kirsten .

You may not be the best at what you do - you may not even be the 2nd , 3rd , 4th , or 5th best - but you 've got to love whatever it is .
And if you do n't love it , or if you can't be the best , you can always drink .
I once asked a compulsive gambler why he would n't rather drop his coins in Time Crisis , as it offered a less lucrative but far more predictable payout than slots .
Noting that I spent all my cash on alcohol , he rejoindered that at least on some nights he 'd actually win .
No , no , I corrected him , when I drink I always win .
Soda Popinksi understood this .
Mr. Strom also owns a pickup truck , which he uses mainly to haul his boat .
When he runs errands , he drives his Smart , which he says is getting 45 miles a gallon .
“ I had to smile the other day when I filled my tank for $ 18 and the guy next to me had a Ford Explorer and the pump was clicking past $ 80 , ” said Mr. Strom , a 66 - year - old retired manager of a Chevrolet dealership .
Previous spikes in sales of smaller cars were often a result of consumers trading down during tough economic conditions or gas - price increases .
When the economy improved or fuel prices dropped again  as they did after the oil - price shocks in the 1970s eased  buyers invariably went back to bigger vehicles .
But with oil prices expected to remain high for years , auto industry executives are seeing a turning point .
“ The era of the truck - based large S.U.V. ’s is over , ” said Michael Jackson , chief executive of AutoNation , the nation ’s largest auto retailer .
Sales of traditional S.U.V.’s are down more than 25 percent this year .
In April , for example , sales of G.M. ’s Chevrolet Tahoe fell 35 percent .
Full - size pickup sales have fallen more than 15 percent this year , with Ford ’s industry - leading F - Series pickup dropping 27 percent in April alone .
Sales of pickups , though , are expected to strengthen with the economy , because of their use as commercial vehicles .

6 D.B. Cooper
Who was he ?
On November 24 , 1971 , a man boarded a plane in Portland under the mundane fake name of Dan Cooper ( we would have gone with " Viktor Blimpmuscle " or " Saxon Wolfcock " but to each his own ) .
He was dressed in heavy clothing and sunglasses and had a bomb in his suitcase .
This was in an innocent time before anyone realized passengers should be checked for that sort of thing , so security was based on the honor system .

Mr. Cooper sat down and handed a note to a stewardess telling her the plane was being hijacked and that he had a bomb ( hijackers were n't nearly as rude back then ) .
He demanded $ 200,000 and four parachutes upon arrival in Seattle .
This is the point in most hijackings where the plane lands and a police sniper shoots the hijacker in the head .
Cooper , however , had a plan .
Once on the ground Cooper let all the passengers off ( keeping three crew members on board to fly the plane ) and in exchange , he got his cash and parachutes .
He ordered the pilot to take off once more , while the FBI could only stand on the tarmac below and shake their fists up at the sky .

Cooper and the crew flew to Reno , Nevada , where he forced them to fly the plane low and slow , which are parachutin ' conditions .
Cooper lowered the rear stairs , jumped out , and was never seen again .
All he left behind were two of the parachutes and his tie .
When the police could n't find the body or the parachutes they started hauling in everyone and their hijacker - looking friends .
The list of suspects was at one point around 1,000 people .
The first suspect they dragged in was a Portland man named D.B. Cooper who was quickly cleared as a suspect , although the media ran his name as the hijacker 's alias ( again , all this could have been avoided if he picked an alias like " Brock Meatstone " or " Senator Samson Loveblast " ) .

What They Say Happened :
Officially the FBI has stated that Cooper did n't survive the jump .
The FBI reached this conclusion based on the fact that Cooper appeared to be a card carrying idiot , seeing as how he jumped in the middle of a heavy rainstorm and could have had no idea of where he was going to land ( he was somewhere northeast of Portland when he jumped ) .
In 1980 a local boy found $ 5,880 of Cooper 's ill - gotten cash washed up on the shores of the Columbia River .
The FBI figured the money meant he was either dead or got mugged by Bigfoot .
What We Think Happened :
We 'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say he landed .
We like to think that immediately after , he was accosted by a group of mountain men who did indescribable things to him .
They then took his money , moved to Seattle and opened the first Starbucks .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama plans to visit the Middle East and Europe this summer , taking time off from campaigning in the United States in an effort to boost his foreign policy credentials .
Obama 's campaign told AP the likely nominee will travel to Jordan Israel , Germany , France and the United Kingdom .
The Illinois senator also has said he intends to visit Iraq and Afghanistan this summer ; his campaign would not say whether those stops would be part of the trip to the Middle East and Europe .
Presidential Hopeful Obama to Bush : Hamas must recognize Israel Yitzhak Benhorin Democratic presidential candidate sends Bush letter expressing unwavering support for Israel .
' We must press Egypt to devote more resources and effort to stopping the smuggling of weapons into Gaza , ' he says Obama to Bush : Hamas must recognize Israel
The campaign also would not disclose the dates of any of the plans in an attempt to protect Obama 's security .
Obama 's campaign manager said this past week that Iraq and Afghanistan would be part of an official congressional trip .
The other stops are part of a campaign - funded visit .
It is unusual for a presidential candidate to travel internationally so close to Election Day , especially in a closely fought campaign .
Obama had considered such a trip last year , but the competitive primary with Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton made it too risky to spend time away from early primary states .
Obama foreign policy adviser Denis McDonough said the senator wants to consult with leaders of some important US allies about common challenges , including terrorism , nuclear proliferation , climate change , Iraq , Afghanistan and Iran
Likely to improve America 's standing
" He obviously wants to consult with the leaders of those countries but also find an opportunity to speak to the people of those countries about our shared values and goals , " McDonough said in an interview Saturday .
The stop in Israel could help improve Obama 's standing among Jewish voters .
Some Jews are concerned about Obama 's willingness to speak with Middle Eastern nations that oppose Israel , while others wonder whether he is a closet Muslim .
Obama 's father and stepfather were both Muslim and he spent part of his childhood in Indonesia , a largely Muslim country .
But he says he is a Christian , was a longtime member of Chicago 's Trinity United Church and attended secular and Catholic schools .
The trip also will help address Republican rival John McCain 's criticism that the first - term Illinois senator lacks the international experience to be commander in chief .
In particular , McCain and the Republican Party have sought to make the case that Obama has not observed conditions in Iraq closely enough to determine whether his plan to remove all combat troops within 16 months is the right course of action .
Obama made his only trip to Iraq in January 2006 as part of a congressional delegation .
McCain , a senator from Arizona and Vietnam War veteran , has been to Iraq eight times , most recently in March .
An Associated Press - Yahoo News poll taken this month found that 61 % of those surveyed see McCain as a good military leader , compared with 27 % for Obama .
But they see Obama as more likely to improve America 's standing in the world , 43 % to 33 % who said the same about McCain .
Dear EarthTalk : I ’ve heard that there are plans to build a large repository for nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain in Nevada , but that plans have been slow and are very controversial .
Where is our nuclear waste kept now and what dangers does it pose ?
-- Miriam Clark , Reno , NV
Plans to store the majority of our nation ’s spent nuclear fuel and other highly radioactive waste at a central repository underneath Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert 80 miles from Las Vegas were first hatched in the mid-1980s .
But the project has languished primarily due to opposition from Nevadans who do n’t want to import such dangerous materials into their backyard .
Critics of the plan also point out that various natural forces such as erosion and earthquakes could render the site unstable and thus unsuitable to store nuclear isotopes that can remain hazardous to humans for hundreds of thousands of years to come .
But the Bush administration is keen to jump - start the project and recently submitted a construction license application to develop the facility — which when completed could hold up to 300 million pounds of nuclear waste — with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) .
In announcing the filing , Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman said that the facility being proposed can “ stand up to any challenge anywhere , ” adding that issues of health safety have been a primary concern during the planning process .
But the administration has still not submitted a crucial document declaring how protective the facility will be with regard to radiation leakage .
Bush ’s Environmental Protection Agency concluded that the facility needs to prevent radiation leakage for up to 10,000 years .
But a federal judge ruled that to be inadequate and ordered the administration to require protection for up to one million years .
The White House argues that the NRC should press on with its review process and that the standard can be settled on later .
Currently , without any central repository , nuclear waste generated in the U.S. is stored at or near one of the 121 facilities across the country where it is generated .
Nevadans like Democratic Senator Harry Reid , who has doggedly opposed the Yucca Mountain repository , say it makes more sense to leave such waste where it is than to risk transporting it across the nation ’s public highways and rail system , during which accidents or even terrorist attacks could expose untold numbers of Americans to radioactivity .
But others say that the current system , or lack thereof , leaves Americans at great risk of radioactive exposure .
The non-profit Nuclear Information and Resource Service concluded in a 2007 report that tons of radioactive waste were ending up in landfills and in some cases in consumer products , thanks to loopholes in a 2000 federal ban on recycling metal that had been exposed to radioactivity .
As with all issues surrounding nuclear technology , where and how to dispose of the wastes is complicated .
While some environmental leaders now cautiously support development of more nuclear reactors ( which are free of fossil fuels ) to help stave off climate change , others remain concerned that the risks to human health and the environment are still too high to go down that road .
Whether or not the NRC approves plans for Yucca Mountain wo n’t resolve the larger debate , of course , but perhaps the greenlighting of other promising alternative energy sources could ultimately make nuclear power unnecessary altogether .

Call it the iPhone economy .
Apple ’s soon - to - open online App Store has triggered a scramble among software developers to write business plans aimed at making money off Apple ’s iPhone , a mini-computer that doubles as a phone .
“ I ’m seeing an excitement among mobile developers that I ’ve never seen before , ” said Sam Altman , chief executive and co-founder of Mountain View - based Loopt , a location - based social networking service .
“ People who said they ’d never start a mobile ( applications ) company because they did n’t want to rely on the carriers are now starting companies focused only on the iPhone . ”
Apple recently provided the tools engineers need to create applications for its popular mobile device .
The Cupertino company said some 250,000 iPhone software development kits have been downloaded .
The App Store Web site , where applications will be sold or given away , is expected to launch soon , perhaps July 11 when the faster next - generation iPhone goes on sale .
Apple could be creating a billion - dollar industry built around the iPhone , said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster .
In a recent note to investors , Munster wrote that the App Store could create a $ 1 billion - plus iPhone ecosystem by the end of 2009 .
Last week , 5,200 software developers packed San Francisco ’s Moscone Center for Apple ’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference .
For the first time , mobile software writers were invited .
Apple offered a taste of the types of services iPhone owners could experience very soon , including near real - time updates and video from Major League Baseball , sophisticated location - based social networking that allows people to find friends , and video games in which users play by tilting the iPhone .
Munster said the applications were “ more powerful and attractive ” than anything he ’d seen on a mobile device before .
What excites many developers are the iPhone ’s capabilities and its “ stable ” software platform , which makes writing programs for it relatively easy and quick .
The iPhone “ puts the Internet in your pocket , whether it ’s e-mail , whether it ’s Web browsing , whether ’s it ’s YouTube , ” Apple vice president Greg Joswiak said .
“ The entire Internet is in your pocket . ”
The iPhone ’s capabilities are sure to become even greater after Apple rolls out its newest version , dubbed 3G for “ third generation , ” which company CEO Steve Jobs says will operate twice as fast as the inaugural device , released just a year ago .
Mobile phone operators and analysts say iPhone users have a huge appetite for data .
M: Metrics , a mobile research firm , reported in spring that 31 percent of iPhone owners watched mobile TV or video vs. a mere 4.6 percent market average .
Fifty percent of iPhone users also reported using their gadget to access a social - networking site , about 12 times more than the industry average .
“ We are going to see things that create totally new behavior , just like the Internet created usage patterns and behavior we had n’t seen before , ” said Matt Murphy , a partner with venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
Murphy manages a $ 100 million iFund that backs start - ups creating applications for the iPhone .
So far , more than 2,000 business plans have been submitted , and three companies have been funded , he said , adding that more money could be added to the fund .
Apple ’s App Store is expected to be modeled after iTunes , the successful online outlet for digital music and video that helped make the iPod a must - have device .
It launched an iPod accessories industry , from high - end speakers to fashionable cases .
Apple has sold about 150 million iPods , while the iPhone , at about 6 million in sales , remains something of a novelty item .
“ This is the iTunes Store for the iPhone , ” Munster said of the App Store .
“ If you build an application that is compelling , people will pay $ 10 , $ 20 for it . ”
The iPhone just might be the device that finally kick - starts mobile phone advertising in the United States , said Ujjal Kohli , CEO of Rhythm NewMedia , a Mountain View start - up .
Its mobile service , called vSnax , provides free video on a range of topics – including news , sports and weather – and attaches ads to them .
IPhone users interested in an advertised product , such as an automobile , can press the screen and be directed to a dealer .
“ The iPhone collapses time and space for advertising , ” Kohli said .
“ No other media has done this . ”
Another appealing aspect of Apple ’s iPhone offer is the company ’s fee structure , which allows developers to keep 70 percent of the revenue from their applications , said Daren Tsui , CEO and co-founder of mobile entertainment start - up mSpot in Palo Alto .
When they sell applications through other devices , carriers demand 40 percent to 60 percent of the revenue , he said .
Still , Tsui said he ’d like to see Apple ’s take drop 15 percent or 10 percent , which is what Japanese mobile carriers charge to encourage aggressive applications development .
Apple is still something of a minnow in the mobile phone market .
Nokia sells more phones in a week than Apple sold in 10 months .
Many analysts do not expect the company to dominate the mobile phone market the way its iPod owns the digital music player industry – at least not any time soon .
Still , its move into the smart - phone market is forcing all the big players to rethink how their devices are designed .
Jobs announced last week Apple would lower the price for the latest iPhone model to $ 199 for its 8 - gigabyte model .
Analysts expect the company will have little trouble meeting its goal of selling 10 million iPhones this year .
And Jobs said the device will be sold in 70 countries by the end of the year .
“ As more vendors gather around the iPhone , the more lucrative it becomes , ” said Richard Stern , senior vice president at SpinVox , which provides a program that allows people to read transcriptions of voice mail on mobile devices .
“ When 6 million people get the iPhone , it ’s worth ‘ X . ’
When 50 million people get them , it ’s a whole different situation . ”
Flying saucers may soon be more fact than mere science fiction .
University of Florida mechanical and aerospace engineering associate professor Subrata Roy has submitted a patent application for a circular , spinning aircraft design reminiscent of the spaceships seen in countless Hollywood films .
Roy , however , calls his design a “ wingless electromagnetic air vehicle , ” or WEAV .
The proposed prototype is small – the aircraft will measure less than six inches across – and will be efficient enough to be powered by on - board batteries .
Roy said the design can be scaled up and theoretically should work in a much larger form .
Even in miniature , though , the design has many uses .
The most obvious functions would be surveillance and navigation .
The aircraft could be designed to carry a camera and light and be controlled remotely at great distances , he said .
Fittingly , Roy said his flying saucer one day could soar through atmospheres other than Earth ’s own .
For example , the aircraft would be an ideal vehicle for the exploration of Titan , Saturn ’s sixth moon , which has high air density and low gravity , Roy said .
The U.S. Air Force and NASA have expressed interest in the aircraft , and the university is seeking to license the design , he said .

“ This is a very novel concept , and if it ’s successful , it will be revolutionary , ” Roy said .
The vehicle will be powered by a phenomenon called magnetohydrodynamics , or the force created when a current or a magnetic field is passed through a conducting fluid .
In the case of Roy ’s aircraft , the conducting fluid will be created by electrodes that cover each of the vehicle ’s surfaces and ionize the surrounding air into plasma .
The force created by passing an electrical current through this plasma pushes around the surrounding air , and that swirling air creates lift and momentum and provides stability against wind gusts .
In order to maximize the area of contact between air and vehicle , Roy ’s design is partially hollow and continuously curved , like an electromagnetic flying bundt pan .
One of the most revolutionary aspects of Roy ’s use of magnetohydrodynamics is that the vehicle will have no moving parts .
The lack of traditional mechanical aircraft parts , such as propellers or jet engines , should provide tremendous reliability , Roy said .
Such a design also will allow the WEAV to hover and take off vertically .
Though the design is promising on paper , towering obstacles stand between the blueprint and liftoff .

No plasma - propelled aircraft has successfully taken flight on Earth .
Such designs have found some success in space , where gravity and drag are minimal , but a vehicle hoping to fly within Earth ’s atmosphere will need at least an order of magnitude more thrust , Roy said .
Also , the power source needs to be extremely lightweight yet still produce enough power to generate the necessary plasma .
Not to mention the fact that the very same plasma that will allow the aircraft to fly also will interfere with electromagnetic waves necessary for communication with the vehicle .
But Roy is confident that the unique nature of his design will allow it to clear the technological hurdles and take to the skies , and he ’s not deterred by the risk of failure .
“ Of course the risk is huge , but so is the payoff , ” he said .
“ If successful , we will have an aircraft , a saucer and a helicopter all in one embodiment . ”
The propulsion system for Roy ’s saucer sprouts from his extensive U.S. Air Force - funded plasma actuator research , the results of which have appeared in more than 15 scholarly journals .
The production of the aircraft will be a joint project of UF ’s mechanical and aerospace engineering department and its electrical and computer engineering department .

OK , I was mad at the waste of tax dollars for ethanol programs that do nothing for the environment or to reduce net fossil fuel consumption .
I was mad that a technology that in no way reduces CO2 production but does introduce radical new land - use - related environmental problems could be sold as an environmental panacea , rather than the corporate welfare it truly is .
I was mad we have decided it is more important to subsidize corn farmers than to continue to provide the world 's poor with cheap food .
And I was flabbergasted that Congress could call for production of more corn - based ethanol than is physically possible with our entire corn crop .
But I really am mad now that ethanol subsidies are making craft beers rarer and more expensive to make :
A global shortage of hops , combined with a run-up in barley prices , is
sending a chill through Arizona 's craft - beer industry .
The hops shortage threatens to boost prices , cut into profits and close
down brewpubs .
It could change the taste and consistency of treasured
local ales .
In Bisbee , " hop heads " already are weaning themselves from Electric
Dave 's India Pale Ale .
Dave Harvan closed his 7 - year - old Electric
Brewing Co. in November , citing the scarcity and high cost of
ingredients .
So why are n't as many farmers growing hops and barley ?
Because the government is paying them ridiculous jack to grow corn so we can burn food into our cars :
Why Did The Fathers of the American Revolution Hate America ?
So I ’m listening to this Peter Beinart / Jonah Goldberg bloggingheads exchange on patriotism and , round about minute 8:00 Goldberg grumbles about the rhetoric of progress and ‘ parliament of man ’ and all that .
Then :
Barack Obama talks about making America better by remaking it , by reinventing it .
The aesthetics of his campaign are about a revolution .
Well , it seems to me that if you believe this country needs a revolution , if you believe that it needs to be remade , then your love for it is n’t that profound .
Has the man never celebrated the 4th of July ?
What does he think the fireworks are supposed to represent ?
His mom told him it ’s just a pretty light show ( she did n’t want her young son to think revolution is a good thing ) and he never thought to ask again when he grew up ?
Why did the founding fathers hate America ?
I agree with Yglesias that there is n’t that much difference between conservative and liberal patriotism .
The difference is that conservatives think ( probably rightly ) that they can get rhetorical mileage , saying things about patriotism they themselves obviously can’t believe .
Let me rather boringly underscore the point .
Ages ago , back in May , I was going to write a post about this .
The occasion then was David Frum and Ramesh Ponnuru criticizing Todd Gitlin on patriotism .
Ponnuru :
Either Gitlin is saying that he loves that part of the country ’s past and present that is compatible with his own liberal political philosophy , or he is saying that the America he loves is an America that neither currently exists nor lives only in his imagination but is instead in a continual process of becoming .
Neither attitude strikes me as what most people would call patriotism .
It ’s not a love of the country as it exists , with liberal , conservative , and apolitical components .
I have no reason to doubt that Gitlin feels that love , but his theoretical apparatus may not give him the terms in which to express it .
I wonder what theoretical apparatus Ponnuru would employ if called upon to express his patriotism ?
Obviously he does n’t love everything about the actually existing U.S.
But if that ’s not how he distinguishes himself from Gitlin , then how ?
Frum :
“ There is this one problem : that hypothetical country does not as yet exist .
This is not patriotism – it is a wish fantasy .
And it is this wish fantasy , this shrinking from realities , this attempt to let phrases do the work of real ideas , that is the ultimate failure not just of a single book , but of the whole new approach to patriotism . ”
So it is absurd to think the American Revolutionaries were patriots , or that the spirit of the American Revolution is an appropriate object of patriotic attachment ?
Abraham Lincoln was indulging a wish fantasy , expressing no patriotic sentiment , when he appealed to the ‘ better angels of our nature ’ ( as opposed to the ‘ actual , warts - and - all angels of our natures ’ ) ?
Seems like a sorry sort of patriotism that forbids you to accentuate the positive about your own country , on pain of failure .
( Sigh . )
Maybe it ’s a Canadian thing .
Getting back to bloggingheads , at one point Goldberg describes some editorial backchat at NR , during which Ponnuru apparently made the standard ‘ ca n’t love of my country be like love of my mother ? ’ point .
Which is actually pretty much the right thing to say .
All the other stuff – the stuff about loving America because it is objectively exceptional in certain ways – is not really it .
If you love America because it is objectively the best at doing certain things that ’s fine but not patriotism .
That ’s like loving your football team only so long as its winning , which is sort of the opposite of team loyalty .
As I was saying : who thinks that loving your mother means loving everything about her to the point of being opposed to your mom improving herself or getting her act together or overcoming her problems ?
If your mom has problems – maybe really serious problems – and your brothers or sisters are trying to help , do you stand athwart the train of helping mom crying ‘ stop ! ’
On the grounds that you love her too much to bear to see her become better , hence un - mom - like ?
Suppose your mom is a drug - addicted schizophrenic , living on the streets .
Is a condition of still loving your mom that you find a way to love the fact of her drug- addiction and mental problems and lack of housing ?
But seriously .
The point , again , is not that Frum or Ponnuru or Goldberg could believe for a second that it is unpatriotic to desire change – even radical change – for your country .
No , that ’s too crazy .
They are only interested in blaming liberals for not believing it .
Bah .
OK , a post on this subject deserves at least some positive thoughts that exhibit a modicum of seriousness .
The varieties of patriotic experience :
1 ) Talking smack about the British on the 4th of July .
This is recreational patriotism and is essentially meaningless but highly enjoyable .
This is sports - team patriotism .
2 ) Patriotism as an essentially military virtue .
Soldiers are the paradigm patriots and you expect certain character traits of soldiers .
We tend to label those traits ‘ patriotic ’ .
However , for reasons too obvious to rehease , those of us who are opposed to military dictatorship do n’t really expect this model to generalize to all aspects of politics and free life .
3 ) ‘ My country , right or wrong ’ .
Either this is it , or nothing is .
The only question is : what ’s the right way to understand this , what ’s the wrong way ?
The wrong way I have illustrated sufficiently .
The right way is Carl Schurz : “ My country , right or wrong ; if right , to be kept right ; and if wrong , to be set right . ”
Wikipedia has some good quotes from Schurz ( I honestly do n’t know much about him ) .
But they are so relentlessly sensible I fear Republicans will fail to find any rhetorical use for them , hence will persist in saying nothing about patriotism that they themselves could possibly believe .
Why You Should n’t be Afraid of Customer Reviews
While it ’s easy to imagine negative reviews leading to lost sales , they more often lead to increased sales of good products and increased customer happiness resulting from helping people make smart decisions .
Yesterday I presented a short , introductory talk called “ 7 Core Principles of Social Design ” at the Voices that Matter Conference in Nashville , Tennessee .
One of the principles I talked about was “ reciprocity ” , and how reciprocity is at the core of a lot of social interaction online , especially things like customer reviews and recommendations .
When people read customers reviews from other people , they feel like returning the favor and write reviews of their own .
I pointed out that Amazon.com has had reviews for years , and only recently have their competitors added them .
For example , Best Buy only added them within the last year , and Circuit City not too long before that .
I suggested that the reason for the failure to add reviews was not a technical one .
These sites certainly had the technological know - how to add reviews to their sites if they chose to .
They ’re doing much more complicated backend processing in other parts of their site : customer reviews would have been relatively easy to add .
I proposed that the real reason they did n’t add reviews was fear .
They feared that allowing the public to criticize products on their site would have several negative effects , including :
Decreased Sales : people would buy less product because they would avoid products with negative reviews
Angry Manufacturers : manufacturers of goods whose products got negative reviews would begin to be upset if their sales went down , souring the relationship
I received a question from someone in the advertising industry who claimed to be skeptical of reviews … that in his mind he thought that people would go out of their way to write negative reviews but not positive ones .
In other words , a site would get a disproportional amount of negative reviews , even if the general sentiment for the product was positive .
This , of course , would lead to decreased sales .
This is a typical example of the fear that I was talking about .
It ’s easy to imagine the damage done by people who write negative reviews .
As someone else in the audience mentioned , they were afraid that if someone went to a site and saw a negative review first then they would leave and be lost forever .
But here are a few points to keep in mind .
Most of the time , negative reviews are genuine .
Many products are bad .
If someone truly has a negative experience with a product , they will write a review not just to get it off their chest , but because they actually want to help others avoid the same fate as they had .
Most people write negative reviews to be helpful .
Negative reviews are an opportunity .
If you treat negative reviews as input into your design process , then you can actually use them as research to improve your offering .
This is a tough pill to swallow , however , as it ’s not easy to admit shortcomings .
People seek out negative reviews .
As someone in the audience mentioned , they almost always zero - in on the negative reviews .
Why ?
Because they ’re already interested in the product , they know the positive aspects of it .
What they ’re looking for are the negative aspects , that crucial information that the manufacturer or the site will never tell you .
People know that products are never as good as they ’re advertised to be , and seek out the balancing information so they can make a smart decision .
People write positive reviews to balance out the negative ones .
This is often overlooked when people think about reviews , they imagine that negative reviews simply beget more negative reviews .
But if a product has a bad rating and people have had an opposite experience with the product , they ’ll be more likely to write a review to balance out the message .
People vote for the underdog , and generally want others to know the truth .
People buy more of positively reviewed products
While negative reviews might lead to decreased sales , positive reviews lead to increased sales .
Therefore , better products are vetted more quickly and get sold more , while poorer products get vetted more quickly and sold less .
This is actually what everyone in the chain should want …
In addition , there are several tactics designers can use to make reviews more valuable .
Good sites average reviews and show distribution .
This dampens the ability for any single review to unfairly upset the pot .
If people can clearly see that there are both positive and negative reviews for a product , they ’ll be more likely to investigate and see why people are having such different experiences
This dampens the ability for any single review to unfairly upset the pot .
If people can clearly see that there are both positive and negative reviews for a product , they ’ll be more likely to investigate and see why people are having such different experiences
Let people rate the reviews .
On Amazon you can rate the review , which helps to moderate rants and overly - biased negative reviews .
This allows the site to display the reviews in helpfulness - order , which means that people see the most helpful ( positive or negative ) reviews first .
This also helps to remove the worry that a single unfair review will upset the pot .
In addition to these points , a huge factor is in convincing management that reviews are good for the long - term health of your site or product .
They ’re the ones who have to deal with any negative effects , so they ’re the most cautious about implementing reviews .
Here are two arguments for using product reviews , tailored to the situation :
For product managers ( who make the product being reviewed ) : Negative reviews exist whether or not they ’re published .
By stopping them from being published , you ’re not stopping negative sentiment , you ’re just slowing down the spread of it .
But in the long term , ignoring that negative sentiment will kill you just as thoroughly as if it were fast - acting .
Why not embrace the speed of feedback to improve your offering ?
For retailer managers ( who distribute products ) : Negative reviews are in incredibly helpful resource for shoppers .
They appreciate knowing ahead of time what problems exist with the product .
Yes , they might not buy because of a negative review , but if you have an alternative positively - reviewed product they ’re much more likely to buy that .
In this way customer reviews are a valuable resource for your customers … they ’ll appreciate that you ’re helping them make a tough decision , and end up happier customers as a result .
In general , people are coming to expect customer reviews as part of the shopping process .
If you do n’t have them , then they ’ll go to Amazon or somewhere else to find them .
In chapter 1 of my book Designing for the Social Web , I include a quote that sums this up nicely .
When I asked a shopper why they went to Amazon and scrolled immediately to the customer reviews , bypassing a tremendous amount of product information from the manufacturer , they replied :
* Illustration : Gretchen Smelter * Bernie Krause listens to nature for a living .
The 69 - year - old is a field recording scientist :
He heads into the wilderness to document the noises made by native fauna — crickets chirping in the Amazon rain forest , frogs croaking in the Australian outback .
But Krause has noticed something alarming .
The natural sound of the world is vanishing .
He 'll be deep inside the Amazon , recording that cricket , but when he listens carefully he also hears machinery :
The distant howl of a 747 or the dull roar of a Hummer miles way .
Krause has a word for the pristine acoustics of nature : biophony .
It 's what the world sounds like in the absence of humans .
But in 40 percent of the locations where Krause has recorded over the past 40 years , human - generated noise has infiltrated the wilderness .
" It 's getting harder and harder to find places that are n't contaminated , " he says .
This is n't just a matter of aesthetics .
The contamination of biophony may soon become a serious environmental issue — Krause says that man-made sounds are already wreaking havoc with animal communication .
We worry about the carbon emissions from SUVs and airplanes ; maybe we should be equally concerned about the racket they cause .
Krause 's argument is simple .
In a biophony , animals divide up the acoustic spectrum so they do n't interfere with one another 's voices .
He shows me a spectrogram of a wilderness recording , in which all the component noises are mapped according to pitch .
It looks like the musical score for an orchestra , with each instrument in its place .
No two species are using the same frequency .
" That 's part of how they coexist so well , " Krause says .
When they issue mating calls or all - important warning cries , they are n't masked by the noises of other animals .
But what happens when man-made noise — anthrophony , as Krause dubs it — intrudes on the natural symphony ?
Maybe it 's the low rumble of nearby construction or the high whine of a turboprop .
Either way , it interferes with a segment of the spectrum already in use , and suddenly some animal can't make itself heard .
The information flow in the jungle is compromised .
Krause has heard this happen all over the world .
For example , the population of spadefoot toads in the Yosemite region of the Sierras is declining rapidly , and Krause thinks it 's because of low - flying military training missions in the area .
The toad calls lose their synchronicity , and coyotes and owls home in on individual frogs trying to rejoin the chorus .
And as Krause has discovered , it does n't take much to disrupt a soundscape .
California 's Lincoln Meadow , for example , has undergone only a tiny bit of logging , but the acoustic imprint of the region has completely changed in tandem with the landscape , and some species seem to have been displaced .
The area looks the same as ever , " but if you listen to it , the density and diversity of sound is diminished , " Krause says .
" It has a weird feeling . "
Biologists were initially skeptical of Krause 's theory , but he 's slowly gaining converts .
Now even bigwigs like Harvard 's E. O. Wilson have gone on record in support .
So how do you quiet an increasingly cacophonous world ?
Perhaps we should be developing not just clean tech but " quiet " tech , industrial machinery designed to run as silently as possible .
More regulations could help , too .
Cities have long had noise ordinances ; wilderness areas could benefit from tighter protections as well .
Some of this is just about educating ourselves .
We all recognize ecological tragedies by sight — when we see pictures of clear - cut areas , say , or melting Arctic ice shelves .
Now we need to learn to listen to the earth , too .
Last year , Krause brought biophony to the masses by creating an extraordinarily cool add - on for Google Earth .
Download it from his WildSanctuary.com site and you can click on dozens of locations worldwide to hear snippets of their soundscape .
I select the Amazon rain forest and my office is suddenly filled with a mesmerizing mix of hoots , cries , and rustling .
It 's spooky — like nothing I 've ever heard before .
And like nothing I 'll ever hear again , if we do n't watch out .
" Earth has a voice , " Krause says .
" We ca n't let it go silent . "

Pickens ' plan is bold — too bad it wo n't work

The Pickens Plan is n't the boon for energy independence that it purports to be .
Dallas billionaire investor and oilman - turned - wind - farmer Boone Pickens on Tuesday unveiled an audacious plan that he hopes will prod policymakers into a more realistic discussion of energy issues .
It calls for , among other things , spending $ 1 trillion to build wind farms from the Texas Panhandle to the Canadian border that he says would meet 20 percent of the nation 's electricity needs .
With the generation from those turbine fields , we could shift natural gas that 's used for generating electricity to powering cars and trucks .
That would reduce our oil imports by 38 percent , Pickens claims .
The plan is riddled with potential pitfalls , but fed by a $ 50 million media campaign , that may not matter .
At a time when presidential candidates and lawmakers eschew meaningful discussion of our mounting energy problems , Pickens ' plan is stirring it up .
His Web site , www.pickensplan.com, has generated " phenomenal " traffic and already inspired at least one supporter - led meeting at an Applebee 's in Georgia that attracted dozens of people , said spokesman Jay Rosser .
" My point is , I have n't seen a plan in 40 - plus years that 's going to solve the problem I 'm talking about , " Pickens told me .
The proposal is typical Pickens , who 's known for bold predictions and grandiose proposals .
His plan for a billion - dollar water pipeline from the Texas Panhandle early in the decade still does n't have any takers .
With prices soaring and America importing 70 percent of its oil , something has to be done , he argued .
" Oil now is going to look cheap in a few years , " he said .
" We need to get ahold of the situation ourselves . "
It 's hard to grasp , though , how parts of the plan would be implemented .
Assuming all the rights to millions of acres could be acquired and the wind farms built , there 's still the problem of wind itself .
It does n't always blow .
A recent study by Cambridge Energy Research Associates found that wind power is least available between June and September , the peak months for electricity consumption .
When the turbines are becalmed , we 'll need other power plants — primarily gas - fired ones , which can be started more quickly than other types of generation — to meet demand .
What 's more , someone has to pay for building transmission lines to carry the power from the prairies .
Guess who ?
In Texas , the cost of new transmission lines is born by consumers , not the generators .
Pickens argued that wind technology will improve as more farms are built , and as commodity prices rise , it will become a cost - effective power source .
" As it moves in , the natural gas will move out , " he said .
" The price of natural gas will still be better for vehicles and still be cheaper than foreign oil . "
Pickens has championed natural gas vehicles since he converted his Cadillac and drove around Dallas in the early 1990s , but it 's unlikely average drivers would do the same .
Thousands of service stations would have to spend millions to install new pumps and storage facilities .
Why do n't we just switch to plug - in hybrids , which automakers say they already have in development ?
We already have the infrastructure we need in our wall sockets .
Then the natural gas generation already in place could still be used and we 'd decrease our foreign oil dependency at the same time .
Wind could still be used to augment generation as it becomes more viable .
Pickens is quick to acknowledge that his plan is n't the only solution .
" If there 's a better one , get it out there and let 's talk about it , " he said .
His plan follows his own businesses .
His Mesa Power is pouring about $ 12 billion into what would be the world 's largest wind farm near Pampa , Texas .
He 's on the board of the country 's biggest provider of natural gas for vehicles , and his hedge fund company , BP Capital , with some $ 4 billion under management , has bet heavily on natural gas producers .
Depending on your view , that either makes his plan self - serving or shows he 's willing to put his money where his mouth is .
I do n't begrudge Pickens his profits .
He 's a successful businessman , and if he gets richer from solving America 's energy problems , so be it .
He wanted to get the country talking , and in that , he 's succeeded .
His plan favors alternative fuels that would be better for the environment and lessen our dependency on foreign oil .
As such , it 's a good starting point for discussion and broadening the public understanding of the problems — even if does n't work .

Per esperienza diretta ho potuto constatare più volte quanto possa essere traumatico e sconvolgente un fallimento o un errore che stravolge gli schemi preconcetti di gente che non solo se ne faceva schermo e scudo , ma che li esponeva con una certa spocchia .
Lasciamo perdere le gaffes dei soliti politici che si permettono di fare le pulci ai peccatucci veniali degli altri , ma guai a ricordargli le loro personalissime magagne , questo è un fenomeno trans / inter - nazionale ( dai nostri Fini / Casini e altri pronti a mettere le mani nella camera da letto e negli uteri dei cittadini , a qualche teocon made in Usa scoperto con la mano sulla patta di qualche giovincello in qualche triste cesso ) .
Lo squarcio nella rete della tranquillità di chi viaggia tranquillo in binari sicuri e apparentemente imperturbabili è spesso talmente piccolo e impercettibile che non può essere colto se non viene osservato con la lente d’ingrandimento da persone esterne , o estranee a quei binari !
Ricordo la sorella di un’amica , mai una bocciatura , diploma con i 60/60 esimi , una lista infinita di trenta , trenta e lode all ’università finchè non arrivò il risultato negativo a due esami dalla fine .
Ricordo che le venne il panico da esame , penso che nella sua mente quelle aule si ingigantissero e rimpicciolissero fino a soffocarla tutte le volte che cercava di mettere la parola fine .
Ritardo il suo iter di un paio d’anni .
Mi sono sempre chiesta se non sarebbe stato meglio un banale rinvio a settembre alle superiori o un bel 18 ai primi test !
Un’altra amica poi , che era sempre pronta ad additare le pecche delle altre donne , dal loro abbigliamento , all ’instabilità sentimentale o il numero di partner quasi si potesse quantificare il loro “ valore ” in base al numero di rapporti sessuali con partner diversi .
Psicofarmaci e terapia interminabile non tanto per il fallimento del matrimonio su cui aveva investito tutta se stessa , il marito , la sua famiglia e quella di lui , ma perché durante quella versione personalissima di Auschwitz che si era creata non aveva avuto il figlio tanto desiderato e su cui riversare tutti quei sogni che non era riuscita a realizzare .
Di solito venivano da famiglie che avevano fornito sempre e solo certezze , mai un dubbio o un no : solo si al minimo pestare di piedi !
Ma se il mio equilibrio mentale o la mia stabilità emotiva deve essere messa a repentaglio per minime oscillazioni nel mio universo personale delle certezze , beh allora sono ben contenta di aver collezionato padellate in faccia sin dal momento del mio concepimento , ringrazio i miei genitori per le crociate con cui ho difeso strenuamente ogni millimetro e nanosecondo di indipendenza .
Ringrazio i professori che mi hanno rimandata a settembre e bocciata in terza superiore , bacio i piedi al mio ex che si è tolto dalle balle lasciandomi e ferendomi nel mio smisurato ego tre anni fa !
Grazie a tutti , di cuore e di testa !
Spesso il male di vivere ho incontrato
di
Eugenio Montale
Spesso il male di vivere ho incontrato :
era il rivo strozzato che gorgoglia ,
era l’incartocciarsi della foglia
riarsa , era il cavallo stramazzato .
Bene non seppi , fuori del prodigio
che schiude la divina Indifferenza :
era la statua nella sonnolenza
del meriggio , e la nuvola , e il falco alto levato .
[ da Ossi di seppia , 1925 ]
NEW YORK — NBC Universal has “ amicably resolved ” a $ 105 - million lawsuit filed by a woman whose brother committed suicide during a taping of its controversial “ Dateline NBC ” series “ To Catch a Predator , ” both parties said today .
Bruce Baron , an attorney for Patricia Conradt , told The Times in an interview today that “ the matter has been amicably resolved to the satisfaction of both parties . ”
Conradt ’s brother , Louis William Conradt Jr. , a 56 - year - old assistant county prosecutor in a Dallas suburb , shot himself in November 2006 when officers showed up at his house as part of a pedophilia sting arranged by “ Dateline . ”
Patricia Conradt sued NBC last July , claiming that the network interfered with police duties and then failed to protect her brother 's safety .
When asked today about the status of the suit , NBC News spokeswoman Jenny Tartikoff echoed Baron , saying “ the matter has been amicably resolved . ”
Both sides declined to comment on when they came to agreement or the terms of the resolution .
A sealed document regarding the suit was filed with the court June 3 , but the case remains open , according a spokesman for the New York Southern District Court .
The resolution of the lawsuit caps a controversial chapter for “ Dateline , ” which drew both ratings bonanzas and sharp critiques for its “ To Catch a Predator ” investigations .
In the segments , which NBC began airing in 2004 , the newsmagazine worked with an Internet watchdog group called Perverted Justice to contact men online who were seeking to meet underage children for sex , then lure them to a house , where they were confronted on camera .
Police waiting outside then arrested the men .
Media ethicists objected to the deception used in the investigation , as well as NBC ’s close relationship with law enforcement agencies in the jurisdictions where it set up stings .

Japan has the highest concentration of vending machines in the world , topping over 5 million in the country , one for every 23 people .
A recent exhibition highlights the latest innovations .
Pingmag ’s Vending Machine Extravaganza highlights several vending machine innovations that were featured at a recent vending machine manufacturer ’s exhibition
In addition to the quantity , the rumors are true , Japan does have the weirdest vending machines in the world .
From the unusual to the creepy its all there .
Seeing that Japan has always been on the cutting of technology , it only makes sense that they would also push the envelope on the features and capabilities of its ubiquitous vending machines .
A notable highlight is the Age recognition vending machine ( In Japanese ) which scans your face to determine whether you are of legal age to buy the vending machine items .
Japan still has cigarettes machines and many adult items such as alcohol and adult entertainment that only adults are legally able to purchase .
The vending machine company is claiming 90 % accuracy .
If you have a baby face or look older than you should , you can always use a credit - card like identification to bypass the face recognition .
The culture of Japan seems to be more suited to vending machine usage , as space and time is limited in their city , and convenience and immediacy is embraced by its city dwellers .
As much as it would be cool to have access to interesting vending machines as such , I ’d rather have the banner - free and natural landscape that can afford regular stores and restaurants to serve my daily needs .

US bailout of mortgage giants :
The politics of plutocracy
By Barry Grey
15 July 2008
For the second time in four months , the US government has intervened to rescue major financial firms and prevent an imminent collapse of the American and global banking system .
The government bailout of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced Sunday goes well beyond the $ 29 billion injection of Federal Reserve funds used to subsidize the takeover of Bear Stearns last March by JPMorgan Chase .
It not only demonstrates the depth of the economic crisis of American capitalism , it also provides an object lesson on the real relations of political power and influence behind the façade of American democracy .
The plan outlined by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would give him virtually unlimited and unilateral authority to pump tens of billions of dollars of public funds into the mortgage finance companies .
At the same time , the Federal Reserve Board announced that it would allow the companies to directly borrow Fed funds .
It is generally conceded that a failure of the two government - chartered mortgage finance companies would have consequences even more cataclysmic than those which would have likely followed a collapse of Bear Stearns .
Between them , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which purchase mortgage loans from banks and other lenders , bundle them into securities and sell them to financial institutions and big investors around the world , hold or guarantee more than $ 5 trillion in mortgage debt .
They currently account for some 80 percent of all new mortgages in the US .
Were they to lose the ability to borrow at a discount , the US housing market would come to a grinding halt .
But even before that happened , US and global financial markets would face a meltdown , since thousands of US banks , hedge funds , pension funds and other institutions hold securities guaranteed by the two companies , and central banks , governments and private banks around the world are heavily invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been at the center of the housing market speculation that generated billions for Wall Street investors and CEOs and has now come crashing down , precipitating the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s .
The two companies are massively leveraged , holding a combined $ 81 billion in capital to back the mortgages they own or guarantee — a ratio of capital to debt of 1.6 percent .
Their Ponzi scheme structures have been undermined by the collapse in home prices and the virulent spread of foreclosures .
Over the past nine months they have lost a combined $ 11 billion and their stock has fallen by as much as 80 percent — a decline that turned into a rout last week as their stock values were cut nearly in half .
Their debacle is the latest and to date most spectacular expression of the decay of American capitalism .
It is another refutation of the myths promoted by the US ruling elite about the miraculous workings of the capitalist market — supposedly the pinnacle of human achievement .
At the same time , it exposes the cynicism behind the official mantra of “ free enterprise . ”
When it comes to big capital , losses are socialized .
Only profits remain private .
That Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not isolated cases , but rather expressions of a systemic crisis , was underscored by the government seizure on Friday of IndyMac , the third largest bank failure in US history .
According to some reports , as many as 150 other banks are close to collapse .
Paulson ’s plan to use taxpayer funds to rescue Wall Street were worked out over the weekend in feverish closed door consultations between the Bush administration , the Fed , the big banks and investment houses and congressional leaders .
They were under enormous pressure to come up with a plan before the Asian markets opened Monday , and the crisis atmosphere was compounded by the fact that Freddie Mac was scheduled to market $ 3 billion in short - term debt .
A catastrophe was looming if the banks and investment houses refused to buy the company ’s bonds .
There can be no doubt that Wall Street exploited the situation to extract from the government the broadest possible guarantees and assurances for its interests .
But the entire scheme had to be sanctioned by the Democratic Congress , since it required changes in the charters and legal regulations governing the two companies .
The immediate and vocal support announced by key Democratic legislators for this massive taxpayer - funded bailout demonstrates the most important fact of American political life : the utter subservience of both parties and all of the official institutions to the financial aristocracy .
Rep. Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , proclaimed his agreement and pledged to have emergency legislation ready for Bush ’s signature by the beginning of next week at the latest .
Senator Christopher Dodd , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , similarly signed off on the blank check for the mortgage giants .
Senator Charles Schumer , a senior member of the Banking Committee , said , “ The Treasury ’s plan is surgical and carefully thought out and will maximize confidence in Fannie and Freddie while minimizing potential costs to US taxpayers . ”
He added that the plan would “ be reassuring to investors , bondholders and mortgage - holders that the federal government will be behind these agencies should it be needed . ”
The corporate - controlled media did its part to boost the scheme by portraying it for the most part as a boon to homeowners .
What does this response demonstrate ?
That when it comes to the vital interests of the financial aristocracy , the entire political system acts on command .
Suddenly , the much bemoaned “ gridlock ” in Congress vanishes .
The Democrats , who have sought to explain away their repeated votes to fund the Iraq war by pointing to the supposedly insurmountable opposition of the Republicans to their “ redeployment ” plans , claiming “ the votes are n’t there ” for their partial withdrawal schemes , now march in lockstep with the minority party to rush through laws demanded by Wall Street .
Other initiatives , such as those on immigration , have died as a result of unbridgeable differences between punitive and even more punitive bills .
But on this issue , Congress moves with military dispatch .
The emergency provisions demanded by Paulson are to be attached to Democratic - sponsored housing bills already passed in the House and the Senate .
The contrast between the bailout for Wall Street and the measures for distressed homeowners in the original bills is instructive .
The former provides the Treasury with a blank check to allocate perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds to prop up the banks .
The latter does nothing to block foreclosures and , according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , will aid less than 20 percent of the 2.5 million homeowners who are expected to receive foreclosure notices this year .
The CBO estimates that the total cost of the Democratic housing measures will be a mere $ 2.7 billion over five years .
There is nothing mysterious about the abject subordination of both Congress and the executive branch to Wall Street .
Paulson , whose worth is estimated in the hundreds of millions , was chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs before taking over the post of treasury secretary .
The Center for Responsive Politics reported in 2006 that about half of the Senate ’s 100 members were millionaires , with an average net worth of $ 8.9 million .
In 2004 , 123 members of the 435 - member House of Representatives earned at least $ 1 million .
The buying of legislators and their votes by corporate interests is carried out openly and shamelessly .
Members of Frank ’s House Financial Services Committee received over $ 18 million from financial services , insurance and real estate firms this year .
Frank himself raised over $ 1.2 million , almost half of which came from finance and related industries .
Senator Dodd ’s top contributor in the 2003-2008 election cycle was Citigroup , followed by SAC Capital Partners .
He raised $ 4.25 million from securities and investment firms .
Senator Schumer ’s top contributor was likewise Citigroup .
He raised $ 1.4 million from securities and investment firms , his most lucrative corporate sector .
The government - corporate nexus is awash in corruption and bribery .
This has grown apace with the so - called “ financialization ” of the US economy over the past three decades .
The ruling elite has systematically scrapped large sections of industry and increasingly amassed its wealth through forms of financial speculation divorced from and destructive of the productive forces .
The result has been an immense growth of financial parasitism alongside a brutal assault on the social position and living standards of the working class .
Social inequality has grown to unprecedented levels , along with a new financial aristocracy that dominates all aspects of public life .
The counterpart of financialization is the criminalization of the American corporate - financial elite .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — which have their roots in social reforms enacted during the New Deal — epitomize these twin processes .
Virtually unregulated , they have engaged in massive speculation , bolstered by accounting fraud and bribery , to provide multi-million - dollar salaries for their top executives .
The former CEO of Freddie Mac , Leland C. Brendsel , paid $ 16.4 million in fines last year to settle charges of mismanagement at the mortgage company .
The year before , the company paid a penalty of $ 3.8 million for illegal payments and perks to members of the House Financial Services Committee .
Fannie Mae , for its part , was fined $ 400 million for accounting manipulation from 1998 to 2004 , during which time top executives reportedly received more than $ 90 million in bonuses .
Nor will the proposed bailout of these companies halt the deepening crisis of American and world capitalism .
It will inevitably further undermine global confidence in the US financial system , intensify the crisis of the US dollar and stoke inflationary pressures .
What is emerging is a crisis in which the solvency of the US government itself is called into question .
As the Wall Street Journal put it on Monday , “ But with financial woes mounting , some investors are betting they may profit from weighing an unthinkable question : Could the US government default ? ”
The bailout with public funds of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will set a precedent for a far broader use of taxpayer money to rescue major financial companies .
Last week Paulson and Bernanke went before the House Financial Services Committee to demand legislation institutionalizing federal intervention to bail out failing Wall Street firms .
The response of key Democrats such as Frank was to urge the regulators to call for such measures now , rather than after the new Congress takes office next year .
The cost of such bailouts will be borne by the working class , in the form of deeper cuts in social programs , education , housing and basic infrastructure , and new waves of corporate downsizing and wage - cutting .
The working class cannot defend its vital interests through pressure on the Democrats or any other institution of the American plutocracy .
In the coming class battles , it must organize itself as an independent political force to fight for the socialist reorganization of society , including the transformation of the banks and finance houses into public utilities under the democratic control of the working population .
Chinese discover first rule of investing - what goes up must come down
She frowned through her glasses at the flashing numbers on the giant screen , trying to assess what they meant for the pension money she had invested .
The bad news came as little surprise : this year , each trip to the retail brokerage has left her feeling queasy .
" Everything 's falling , and my shares are falling too .
I feel a bit ill because of the money I 've lost , " she admitted with a wince .
The retired supermarket administrator , who did not want to give her real name , is one of millions of Chinese investors to discover that shares can go down , and down , and down , as well as up .
Last year , as stocks soared , people stampeded into the market .
Customers at her brokerage , a CITIC Securities branch in east Beijing , rose five - fold to 25,000 between the start of 2006 and the end of last year .
Its manager , Gu Xiaoyi , estimates that 60 million Chinese people now trade shares .
In a little more than six months , the benchmark Shanghai composite index doubled , passing the 6,000 mark in October .
Since then it has nosedived to less than half that level - yesterday closing at 2941 .
Many analysts believe it would have sunk further by now had the government not intervened .
Small shareholders have been badly hit ; some have lost their life savings .
A few have even killed themselves in despair as their losses mounted .
Most seem unable to stay away from the brokerages .
On a busy day , 500 cram into the dingy CITIC room .
Regulars sit from open to close of each session , bringing cushions to pad the hard red plastic chairs .
Keeping half an eye on the screen , they chat , sip tea from flasks and play cards .
Other investors crowd around terminals , using swipe cards to check their own stocks or offering advice to friends and strangers alike .
Zhou began trading here last year , seduced by glossy brochures on stock issues and the hope of better returns than a savings account - particularly with inflation outstripping interest rates .
" I read loads of material and it said the next decade would be the golden years for the Chinese stock market because the economy was developing , " she explained .
" We started buying stocks and it was very , very good .
When the index reached 5000 I did n't sell because it was still growing .
But then it fell by 10 % - then another 10 % , then another .
" I tried to break even by buying more , because I thought the cheap stocks would go up again .
So when the index hit 4,000 I bought .
Then it went down to 3,000 .
" Now I just want to sell them off and stop dealing .
It 's too much of a risk . "
So far Zhou 's investments have lost her 10,000 yuan ( £ 740 ) , more than two - thirds the average annual income in urban China .
Despite her disenchantment , she has yet to bail out ; maybe , she said , the index would hit 6,000 again in a year or two .
Gu acknowledged that many customers know little about buying shares or reading the market .
" Last year , loads of people just ran in and started buying stocks because someone had told them it was a great time to do it , " he said .
" Ninety - five percent of them did n't know what they were doing or what they were buying .
It was only when it dropped so dramatically that they realised it was actually quite risky . "
He argued that the ups and downs were typical growing pains for a new market , suggesting that investors were becoming more sophisticated and regulation improving .
" In the west you have hundreds of years of history in the stock market and it was n't always stable ...
It 's through the highs and lows that you learn , " he added , suggesting that the market was " basically stable " now .
Several analysts suggest that it is settling down now that last year 's bubble has burst .
Others believe that assessment is optimistic , and argue the downward trend will continue .
" The economy is slowing down ...
The stock market will also continue to slide , " said one analyst , who asked to remain anonymous .
Certainly , there is widespread anxiety about the economy and in particular inflation .
Last week , Stephen Green - the influential head of China research at Standard Chartered - warned : " The golden years are over , at least for the moment . "
Yan Yuanrun at West China Securities argued : " Although the market is not very mature , it is still very much connected to the macroscopic economic development . "
Others argue that it bears little relation to the overall outlook , or even the performance of individual companies , and has clear links to government policy .
" If you want to invest in the Chinese market , the only thing that matters is what the government will do tomorrow , " said Michael Pettis , a former banker and now professor of finance at Peking University .
" Do n't waste your time trying to figure out who 's profitable and who 's not - it does n't matter . "
Most of the financial world believes the government is determined to keep the Shanghai index above 3,000 or as near as possible in the run-up to the Olympics , if not beyond .
Analysts point to a range of recent action , from cutting stamp duty and restricting the sale of shares freed from lock - up periods to ordering mutual funds not to issue stock .
" Every time we get close to 3000 there 's a new flurry of announcements aimed at boosting the market , " said Pettis .
" It 's a very dangerous game because every time the government intervenes in a non-fundamental way it loses credibility .
It undermines the development of a real and fundamental investor base and strengthens the existing dynamic .
" The market shot up 5 % before the announcement [ on stamp duty ] and 10 % afterwards - but now it 's retraced all of that . "
While experts fret about the future , most small investors are simply hanging on in there .
Some seem paralysed by their losses ; others , curiously sanguine , comparing investment with the fun of placing a bet .
Taxi driver Peng Desheng did not even know what stocks his family owned - he had simply told his wife to " go and spend some thousands of yuan " last year , but was unperturbed by the decline .
He said : " It 's like gambling : you need the courage to lose a bit of money or what 's the point ?
You might as well spend all your money on steamed buns and sit at home eating them . "
Dennis Quaid Leaves Hollywood : ' Houston We Have Arrived '
The train is going down the tracks . "
We have a lot of family there and we have a really nice plot of land .
We have 30 or 40 friends and family members within two miles of us .

No , Dennis is not retiring from acting , they have decided to move closer to family and friends .
Dennis told Extra :
The couple are moving to Quaid 's hometown of Houston with their 7 - month old twins , Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace .
The family suffered a near tragic ending for their twins last year when they were given 10,000 units of the blood thinner Heparin ( the normal dose is 10 units ) .
Dennis said : Kimberly and Dennis have been working hard to make sure that the nightmare they lived does n't happen to any other families .
They have established a foundation and will be lobbying for a barcode procedure to minimize human error in the medical field .

Huffington Post.com , the political blog community , is considering raising more money and has seen traffic triple since last year , but the big question now is how popular the site will be when the 2008 presidential campaign is over .
Founded in 2005 by author Arianna Huffington , the site was intended to provide a left - of - center audience with political commentary and analysis in the form of constantly updated blogs , penned by various talking heads and celebrities , and other members of Huffington 's extensive social network .
In recent months the site has reaped the benefits of its strong partisan political tone and content , as a nail - biter of an election season nudged traffic from half a million visitors per month last August to a high of over 3 million in March ( back down to 2 million by April ) , according to Compete.com , an internet analytics website .
In a common new - media discrepancy , the site 's internal numbers , obtained via Google analytics , are even more impressive .
" We 're averaging 11 million to 12 million uniques a month and 100 million pageviews , " says Betsy Morgan , HuffPo's C.E.O .
But a rising tide lifts all boats , and Huffington Post is n't the only website with a political bent to enjoy increased traffic in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election .
Sites such as Slate.com , Politico.com , and , to a lesser extent , TalkingPointsMemo.com and DailyKos.com , have all enjoyed steady increases in traffic between last April and this , the most recent period for which Compete.com has data .
While Huffington
Post 's growth has certainly been dramatic , detractors wonder if the site 's political focus might become a liability next fall when the election is over and the nation settles back into business as usual .
Morgan does n’t think so .
" We believe that there 's no longer a historical political cycle .
People are interested in politics 365 days of the year , " she says .
Nevertheless , Huffington
Post is making a conspicuous effort to expand its reach beyond the confines of Washington D.C.
Last summer it rolled out several new vertical sites , including non-political topics such as media , business , and entertainment .
Just last week the site introduced another new channel , green , which will focus on eco-news and trends .
And Morgan says there are more on the way .
Also new ?
The site 's tagline , " the internet newspaper , " introduced in 2008 .
The line de-emphasizes politics in favor of a more neutral , newsy tone .
According to Morgan , over half of the site 's traffic is now for non-political stories .
Barry Parr , a media analyst at JupiterResearch , says Huffington Post is better positioned than most political websites to weather the transition to a post-election U.S. , although he adds that a slight drop - off in the site 's traffic after election fever subsides would n't be surprising .
A bigger concern , especially as the site navigates the wider waters of general news coverage — placing itself in the same category as newspapers and news sites that already exist — is the vulnerability of its advertising - driven business model .
" The challenge for anybody in the news business is that a general news audience is not a very desirable one to advertisers , " says Parr .
That 's because news audiences , unlike those for beauty or sports sites , do n't come packaged into convenient demographic bundles — 18 - to - 34 - year - old males , for example .
And for Huffington Post , which is n't attracting the volume of visitors that sites like Yahoo or AOL do , the appeal for advertisers may be limited .
The answer to sustainability might lie in the site ’s staking out more niche areas of credible coverage , as it has so successfully done with politics .
Parr thinks an obvious place to start is media , where HuffingtonPost has published relatively strong , although less prominent , content .
" That 's an area their audience is going to be interested in , " he says .
And with a dearth of mainstream publications focusing explicitly on the media business , and Huffington Post 's roster of plugged - in contributors , the site stands a good shot of owning this area .
For now , however , the Huffington Post homepage is dominated by half - inch - tall red block letters , " … 152 Days And Counting … " until November 4 , 2008 .
That 's the day of the U.S. presidential election , and quite possibly , the day the game changes for HuffingtonPost .

Ms Bhutto was assassinated last December at an election rally Pakistan and the United Nations have agreed in principle to set up a UN panel to investigate the killing of Pakistani ex-PM Benazir Bhutto .
Pakistan 's foreign minister said UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had agreed to his government 's request for such an investigation .
A UN statement said a broad understanding had been reached , but further consultation would be required .
Ms Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack on a rally last December .
Five people have been arrested in connection with the killing , but no - one has been convicted .
After meeting Mr Ban on Thursday , Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told reporters : " The objectives are for the commission to identify the culprits , perpetrators , organisers and financiers of the assassination . "
He added that Mr Ban had asked for further consultation with Pakistan and UN officials but that a " broad understanding " had been reached on the nature of the commission , its funding , access to information and ways to safeguard its impartiality and independence .
" In principle we have decided to move on , but the modalities have to be discussed , " Mr Qureshi said .
' Lax security '
Ms Bhutto 's killing triggered deadly riots across the country .
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf blamed an al - Qaeda - linked militant for the attack and refused to seek a UN probe .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He invited police from London 's Scotland Yard to assist in the inquiry into her death .
In their report the British detectives said they believed she died due to a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of a bomb blast .
The Pakistani investigation into her death concluded that a lone attacker fired shots at Ms Bhutto before detonating explosives , but said that bullets were not the cause of death .
Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) rejected both these versions , claiming adequate security had not been provided for Ms Bhutto , and called for a wider inquiry by the UN to establish the identity and motives of the assassins .
A PPP - led coalition defeated Mr Musharraf 's allies in general elections in February .
Ms Bhutto , twice prime minister of Pakistan , lived in self - imposed exile after Mr Musharraf assumed power in 1999 .
In October 2007 she returned to Pakistan to campaign for the PPP in parliamentary and provincial elections - the first to be held since President Musharraf resigned as head of the army and became a civilian leader Shortly after her return , she survived bomb attacks on her convoy in Karachi that killed more than 100 people .
But Ms Bhutto continued to campaign for the restoration of democracy and was assassinated on 27 December at a PPP rally in Rawalpindi .
She was standing upright in her armoured vehicle , with her head exposed above the open roof escape hatch , waving to the crowd when an attacker opened fire .
Seconds later , a bomb was set off at the scene which left some 20 other people dead .

Trackbacks Supreme Court Adopts Individual Rights Interpretation of the Ninth Amendment :!
The unamended Constitution and the Bill of Rights use the phrase “ right of the people ” two other times , in the First Amendment ’s Assembly - and - Petition Clause and in the Fourth Amendment ’s Search - and - Seizure Clause .
The Ninth Amendment uses very similar terminology ( “ The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people ” ) .
All three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights , not “ collective ” rights , or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body .
Three provisions of the Constitution refer to “ the people ” in a context other than “ rights ” — the famous preamble ( “ We the people ” ) , § 2 of Article I ( providing that “ the people ” will choose members of the House ) , and the Tenth Amendment ( providing that those powers not given the Federal Government remain with “ the States ” or “ the people ” ) .
Those provisions arguably refer to “ the people ” acting collectively — but they deal with the exercise or reservation of powers , not rights .
Nowhere else in the Constitution does a “ right ” attributed to “ the people ” refer to anything other than an individual right .
In other words , the Supreme Court has now rejected the " collective rights " reading of the Ninth Amendment that has been put forth by Akhil Amar and Kurt Lash .
Justice Scalia adds the following footnote that deals with an example used by both to justify a collective rights model of the Bill of Rights : JUSTICE STEVENS is of course correct . . . that the right to assemble cannot be exercised alone , but it is still an individual right , and not one conditioned upon membership in some defined “ assembly , ” as he contends the right to bear arms is conditioned upon membership in a defined militia .
And JUSTICE STEVENS is dead wrong to think that the right to petition is “ primarily collective in nature . ”
Given how rarely the Supreme Court ever mentions the Ninth Amendment , this is big !
Buried in Justice Scalia 's exegesis on the Second Amendment is a wonderful gift to those of us who study and care about the Ninth Amendment :
In other words , the Supreme Court has now rejected the " collective rights " reading of the Ninth Amendment that has been put forth by Akhil Amar and Kurt Lash .
Justice Scalia adds the following footnote that deals with an example used by both to justify a collective rights model of the Bill of Rights : Given how rarely the Supreme Court ever mentions the Ninth Amendment , this is big !
" As soon as I felt it , I yelled .
It really hurt .
When it happened , I knew in the back of my mind it was a snake .
I seen him coming out from between my legs .
I think I may spend a post or two talking about Kan extensions .
They appear to be black magic to Haskell programmers , but as Saunders Mac Lane said in Categories for the Working Mathematician :
All concepts are Kan extensions .
So what is a Kan extension ?
They come in two forms : right - and left - Kan extensions .
First I 'll talk about right Kan extensions , since Haskell programmers have a better intuition for them .
Introducing Right Kan Extension
If we observe the type for a right Kan extension over the category of Haskell types :
newtype Ran g h a = Ran { runRan :: forall b. ( a -> g b ) -> h b }
This is defined in category - extras under Control .
Functor .
KanExtension along with a lot of the traditional machinery for working with them .
We say that Ran g h is the right Kan extension of h along g .
and mathematicians denote it .
It has a pretty diagram associated with it , but thats as deep as I 'll let the category theory go .
This looks an awful lot like the type of a continuation monad transformer :
newtype ContT r m a = ContT { runContT :: ( a -> m r ) -> m r }
The main difference is that we have two functors involved and that the body of the Kan extension is universally quantified over the value it contains , so the function it carries can't just hand you back an m r it has lying around unless the functor it has closed over does n't depend at all on the type r .
Interestingly we can define an instance of Functor for a right Kan extension without even knowing that g or h are functors !
Anything of kind * -> * will do .
instance Functor ( Ran g h ) where fmap f m = Ran ( \\k -> runRan m ( k . f ) )
The monad generated by a functor
We can take the right Kan extension of a functor f along itself ( this works for any functor in Haskell ) and get what is known as the monad generated by f or the codensity monad of f :
instance Monad ( Ran f f ) where return x = Ran ( \\k -> k x ) m >>= k = Ran ( \\c -> runRan m ( \\a -> runRan ( k a ) c ) )
This monad is mentioned in passing in Opmonoidal Monads by Paddy McCrudden and dates back further to Ross Street 's " The formal theory of monads " from 1972 .
The term codensity seems to date back at least to Dubuc 's thesis in 1974 .
Again , this monad does n't care one whit about the fact that f is a Functor in the Haskell sense .
This monad provides a useful opportunity for optimization .
For instance Janis Voigtländer noted in Asymptotic improvement of functions over Free Monads that a particular monad could be used to improve performance --
Free monads as you 'll recall are the tool used in Wouter Sweirstra 's Data Types á la Carte , and provide an approach for , among other things , decomposing the IO monad into something more modular , so this is by no means a purely academic exercise !
Voigtländer 's monad ,
newtype C m a = C ( forall b. ( a -> m b ) -> m b )
turns out to be just the right Kan extension of another monad along itself , and can equivalently be thought of as a ContT that has been universally quantified over its result type .
The improvement results from the fact that the continuation passing style transformation it applies keeps you from traversing back and forth over the entire tree when performing substitution in the free monad .
The Yoneda Lemma
Heretofore we 've only used right Kan extensions where we have extended a functor along itself .
Lets change that :
Dan Piponi posted a bit about the Yoneda lemma a couple of years back , which ended with the observation that the Yoneda lemma says that check and uncheck are inverses :
> check :: Functor f => f a -> ( forall b . ( a -> b ) -> f b ) > check a f = fmap f a > uncheck :: ( forall b . ( a -> b ) -> f b ) -> f a > uncheck t = t id
We can see that this definition for a right Kan extension just boxes up that universal quantifier in a newtype and that we could instantiate :
> type Yoneda = Ran Identity
and we can define check and uncheck as :
check ' :: Functor f => f a ->
Yoneda f a check ' a = Ran ( \\f -> fmap ( runIdentity . f ) a ) uncheck ' :: Yoneda f a -> f a uncheck ' t = runRan t Identity
Limits
We can go on and define categorical limits in terms of right Kan extensions using the Trivial functor that maps everything to a category with a single value and function .
In Haskell , this is best expressed by :
data Trivial a = Trivial instance Functor Trivial where fmap f _ = Trivial trivialize :: a ->
Trivial b trivialize _ = Trivial type Lim = Ran Trivial
Now , in Haskell , this gives us a clear operational understanding of categorical limits .
Lim f a ~ forall b. ( a -> Trivial b ) -> f b
This says that we can't use any information of the value a we supply , or given by the function ( a -> Trivial b ) when constructing f b , but we have to be able to define an f b for any type b requested .
However , we have no way to get any b to plug into the functor !
So the only ( non-cheating ) member of Lim Maybe a is Nothing , of Lim [ ] a is [ ] , etc .
Left Kan extensions
Left Kan extensions are a bit more obscure to a Haskell programmer , because where right Kan extensions relate to the well - known ContT monad transformer , the left Kan extension is related to a less well known comonad transformer .
First , the a Haskell type for the Left Kan extension of h along g :
data Lan g h a = forall b. Lan ( g b -> a ) ( h b )
This is related to the admittedly somewhat obscure state - in - context comonad transformer , which I constructed for category - extras .
newtype ContextT s w a = ContextT { runContextT :: ( w s -> a , w s ) }
However , the left Kan extension provides no information about the type b contained inside of its h functor and g and h are not necessarily the same functor .
As before we get that Lan g h is a Functor regardless of what g and h are , because we only have to map over the right hand side of the contained function :
instance Functor ( Lan f g ) where fmap f ( Lan g h ) = Lan ( f . g ) h
The comonad generated by a functor
We can also see that the left Kan extension of any functor f along itself is a comonad , even if f is not a Haskell Functor .
This is of course known as the comonad generated by f , or the density comonad of f .
instance Comonad ( Lan f f ) where extract ( Lan f a ) = f a duplicate ( Lan f ws ) = Lan ( Lan f ) ws
Colimits
Finally we can derive colimits , by :
type Colim = Lan Trivial
then Colim f a ~ exists b. ( Trivial b -> a , f b ) , and we can see that operationally , we have an f of some unknown type b and for all intents and purposes a value of type a since we can generate a Trivial b from thin air , so while limits allow only structures without values , colimits allow arbitrary structures , but keep you from inspecting the values in them by existential quantification .
So for instance you could apply a length function to a Colim [ ] a , but not add up its values .
You can also build up a covariant analog of the traditional Yoneda lemma using Lan Identity , but I leave that as an exercise for the reader .
I 've barely scratched the surface of what you can do with Kan extensions , but I just wanted to shine a little light on this dark corner of category theory .
For more information feel free to explore category - extras .
For instance , both right and left Kan extensions along a functor are higher - order functors , and hence so are Yoneda , Lim , and Colim as defined above .
Thats all I have time for now .
Code for right and left Kan extensions , limits , colimits and the Yoneda lemma are all available from category - extras on hackage .
[ Edit : the code has since been refactored to treat Yoneda , CoYoneda , Density and Codensity as separate newtypes to allow for instance both Yoneda and Codensity to be different monads ]

In the wake of WND news coverage , the FBI is now reviewing a Wikipedia photo of a nude adolescent that could violate federal child - pornography laws .
The image in question , titled " Virgin Killer " from RCA 's 1976 Scorpions rock album , depicts a naked pre-pubescent girl ( appearing about 10 years of age ) in a provocative pose .
Her chest is completely exposed and a small crack is placed over her vagina .
The album 's cover was banned in the United States due to its extremely controversial nature and was later replaced with a photo of the band .
When WND brought the image to the attention of several Wikipedia representatives , they denied any knowledge of it .
Asked if the photograph of the nude child would remain on the site or be
taken down , Jay Walsh , head of communications for the Wikimedia
foundation , responded :
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
I have no idea when it will come down , as I probably already discussed
with you – the foundation does not play a direct role in making edits
to Wikipedia .
Wikipedia is a platform for use by members of the public ,
around the world .
I understand your concern has been raised with volunteer
administrators and editors .
They will review and consider your request ,
in the context of the Wikipedia editorial policies .
As of this evening , the photo of the nude child was still available online .
The nude album cover is just one of many hard - core pornographic images displayed on Wikipedia , WND has revealed .
Mark Pelligrini , regional representative for Wikipedia , told WND , " Wikipedia 's goal is to provide an encyclopedia that contains the sum of all human knowledge .
To that end , Wikipedia does not censor objectionable material .
" [ I ] f someone goes to the articles on ' sex , ' ' penis ' or any graphic topic , we do provide frank descriptions and images , " Pelligrini said .
" For images , we aim for clinical pictures of the sort you would find in an anatomy or medical textbook . "
However , in addition to textbook anatomy images , the following can also be found on Wikipedia :
Recordings of women experiencing orgasms
Videos of nude men participating in " ejaculation educational demonstrations "
Detailed photographs of men and women masturbating
Images of mammary intercourse
Close - up images of topless women and male and female sexual anatomy
Large - scale photos of men performing oral sex on one another ( and performing oral sex on themselves )
An illustrated list of sex positions
Threesomes
Photos of nude strippers
Matt Barber , a constitutional law attorney who serves as Concerned Women for America 's policy director for cultural issues , expressed outrage at Wikipedia 's decision to allow sexually explicit images .
RELATED : SOPA opponents may go nuclear
" Children use Wikipedia all of the time for reports for school , and this stuff is not just pornography , this is hard - core pornography , " he said .
" Much of it may even be in violation of our nation 's obscenity laws . "
Cary Bass , volunteer coordinator for Wikipedia , told WND , " There 's not really a definition of pornography . "
As for children 's access to the site , he said , " If a child is looking at an article about a penis , he should expect to see a penis . "
Barber expressed concern about the nude image of the child in particular .
" Although it 's an old album cover , it is done in very poor taste , " Barber said .
" There 's no utility in allowing the posting of that image of child pornography on the website .
It could appeal to the prurient interests of pedophiles around the world .
By allowing that image to remain posted , Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and pedophilia . "
Barber is asking Wikipedia to pull all hard - core pornographic images or post a predominantly featured warning for minors before sexually explicit images are displayed .
" There 's no policy on pornography on Wikipedia , " Bass told WND .
" But of course , we do n't want anything illegal on this site . "
The online encyclopedia indicated it was inundated with e-mails from concerned users in the wake of WND 's initial report .
In a WND poll related to the story , the No. 1 response , at more than 47 percent , had readers saying Wikipedia is clearly violating U.S. obscenity laws and should face prosecution .

Mr Musharraf and Mr Sharif are bitter political enemies One of Pakistan 's most powerful political leaders , Nawaz Sharif , has demanded the trial and resignation of President Pervez Musharraf for treason .
Mr Sharif was reacting to a former general who accused the president of starting the 1999 Kargil war with India without informing the government .
The war led to a falling out between Mr Sharif , who was prime minister , and Mr Musharraf , then army chief .
Months later , Mr Sharif 's government was toppled in a military coup .
' Never briefed '
It happened after he attempted to sack Mr Musharraf , the coup leader .
The president has since maintained that the army had taken the civilian government on board over the Kargil plan , but Mr Sharif insists the operation was launched behind his back .
Now a senior retired army general , Lieut - Gen Jamshed Gulzar Kiani , has endorsed Mr Sharif 's position .
" In my view , Nawaz Sharif did not know anything about Kargil , he was never briefed by the army , " he told a Geo TV interviewer on Monday .
The Kargil war was relatively brief but very bloody The Kargil operation was intended to sever a key Indian supply line to the disputed Kashmir region .
Mr Sharif ordered the troops out of Kargil when the US warned Pakistan that the war might spill over across a wider region .
Some in military circles have blamed him for " succumbing to American pressure " and aborting a " brilliant " plan .
But Mr Kiani said in his interview that it was a " disastrous plan , a mistake ( of Mr Musharraf ) which resulted in defeat " .
He also lashed out at President Musharraf for ignoring his corps commanders ' advice of not siding with the US " blindly " in its so - called war on terror , saying this had given birth to suicide bombers who now could not be brought under control .
Prematurely retired " Pervez Musharraf should be punished and made an example so that others do not dare do such damage to the country again , " he said .
Commenting on the interview , Nawaz Sharif told the media on Tuesday that Gen Kiani had vindicated his position on the issue .
He said Mr Musharraf should be tried for treason .
A major - general at the time of 1999 coup , Mr Kiani was handpicked by Mr Musharraf to lead the 111 Brigade , and later the 10 - Corps , both of which have been key to all previous military take - overs .
After his retirement in 2001 , he was given chairmanship of the Federal Public Service Commission which recruits personnel for the country 's top administrative positions .
But in 2003 , he was prematurely retired after his terms of contract were changed by Mr Musharraf .
He went to court against that decision .

BEN - GURION AIRPORT , Israel ( Reuters ) -
An Israeli guard on the perimeter of a farewell airport ceremony for French President Nicolas Sarkozy shot himself dead on Tuesday , causing a security stir but not endangering the visiting leader , police said .
Bodyguards rushed Sarkozy and his wife to their plane and whisked Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Shimon Peres toward armored cars on the tarmac .
“ This was in no way an assassination attempt , ” police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said , calling the incident a suicide .
The two Israeli leaders later returned to the aircraft to bid the Sarkozys goodbye after it was established that the incident was over and posed no threat .
The plane then took off .
Rosenfeld said the guard who shot himself was a paramilitary policeman assigned to a security patrol at the airport .
During his three - day state visit , Sarkozy repeatedly put himself forward as a possible broker of peace between Israel and the Palestinians , using his support among Israelis to mend ties and nudge them towards a peace deal .
Sarkozy has branded himself an ally of the Jewish state , saying its security cannot be called into question and that it is “ not alone ” in facing any threat posed by Iran ’s nuclear program .
That has earned him praise from Israeli leaders .

“ For you to be able to make peace there has to be a third partner who comes and tells you honestly ‘ We will help you because we have friends on both sides ’ , ” Sarkozy told a gathering of businessmen on Tuesday morning .
“ France and Europe want to get involved in the peace process , ” he said later in the day .
On July 1 , France takes over the rotating six - month presidency of the European Union -- one of a Quartet of world powers trying to broker Middle East peace .
BARRIER
The main event of Sarkozy ’s visit was his address on Monday to Israel ’s parliament , in which he called for an end to the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and for Israel and a future Palestine each to have a capital in Jerusalem .
He ended his stay on Tuesday with a short visit to the Palestinian - ruled town of Bethlehem , which is surrounded by Israel ’s concrete and barbed - wire West Bank barrier .
Sarkozy told Israel diplomatic progress was the real key to security .
“ Speaking to my Israeli friends , I want to tell them : ‘ Do you think this wall will guarantee Israel ’s security forever ?
No one can think that ’ , ” Sarkozy told a joint news conference with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
Slideshow ( 11 images )
“ What will guarantee Israel ’s longevity and security ... is the creation of a democratic , modern Palestinian state on its borders , ” he said , adding that he understood the security concerns of Israelis and did not want to “ lecture ” them .
Palestinians call the project a land grab .
The International Court of Justice says the barrier is illegal because it cuts through land that Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war .
Israel says it set up the barrier to stop suicide bombers used to spearhead a Palestinian uprising that erupted in 2000 .
Sarkozy threw his weight behind Abbas , who recently revived peace talks with Olmert , and strongly criticized Islamist Hamas , which seized control of the Gaza Strip from Abbas a year ago .
“ France talks to men of peace , not to those who lay bombs .
Hamas is totally wrong to behave the way it does .
One does not make peace with terrorism , one does not talk to terrorism , ” Sarkozy said , adding that his stance could change if Hamas did .

Bush allies lash out at former flack 's tell - all David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday May 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This President Bush 's onetime lapdog has decided to unleash his bark -- and more than a few bites -- in a scathing new tell - all about the deceptive inner workings of the White House .
Casting aside more than a decade of loyalty , former Bush spokesman Scott McClellan has blown the whistle on the propaganda peddling that preceded the invasion of Iraq , the dishonesty top officials used to obscure the CIA leak case and even George W. Bush 's own capacity for self - delusion .
Still - loyal members of Bush 's inner circle are none too happy with McClellan 's new book , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception , and they are doing everything they can to try to save face .
" Scott , we now know , is disgruntled about his experience at the White House .
For those of us who fully supported him , before , during and after he was press secretary , we are puzzled .
It is sad -- this is not the Scott we knew , " current White House mouthpiece Dana Perino said Wednesday .
" The book , as reported by the press , has been described to the president , " she said .
" I do not expect a comment from him on it -- he has more pressing matters than to spend time commenting on books by former staffers . "
Politico reporter Mike Allen , who first reported details from the book Tuesday night , says none of McClellan 's revelations or observations are particularly novel , but the fact that they 're coming from someone who was so close to the president gives them particular weight .
" He 's put on a historian 's hat ; he 's not an administration flack anymore .
And that 's why there 's such great unhappiness with him , " Allen said on CNN 's American Morning Wednesday .
" People say he 's given up the only good quality he had , in their view , which is loyalty . "
The book came as a surprise to many in Washington who thought McClellan 's book would be much tamer , despite a blurb last year that revealed he passed along untrue information about the leak of Valerie Plame 's identity .
Fishbowl DC , a blog covering the Washington press , speculates one reason McClellan might have been so tough :
Our take :
We 're sure that McClellan means what he says , but lots of Washingtonians think poorly of their successors but bite their tongue and play the role of a good soldier .
So why did n't McClellan do this ?
Simple : Speaking out against the Bush administration in such harsh tones is simply a smart career move by McClellan .
He never became a stand - alone brand .
He was never adored by the press corps .
He was never adored by the Bush White House and Republicans generally ( especially not now ) .
He never developed his own schtick like Tony Snow ( charming , funny , cancer survivor ) or Dana Perino ( hot , snippy , cute dog ) .
So what does this get him ?
Some John Dean - like street cred and the business opportunities ( books , speaking engagements , consulting gigs , etc. ) presented to a " reformed Republican " who possesses a rather rare quality nowadays ( and one loved by the Left ) : A willingness to speak out against the Bush administration 's march to war .
Whatever his motive , McClellan 's book has created the kind of stir that the White House used to rely on McClellan to tamp down .
Further revelations are likely once the tell - all hits store shelves come Monday .
McClellan 's writes that the Bush Administration used propaganda to sell the Iraq war and that Bush Administration officials encouraged him to lie in the Valerie Plame scandal .
Former top Bush advisors Karl Rove and Fran Townsend have disputed McClellan 's claims .
Rove accused McClellan of sounding like a " left - wing blogger . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Well , it looks like there will be no Microhoo after all .
Microsoft and Yahoo seem less likely now to merge in light of yesterday 's news .
But there 's still a lot of merger activity going on that should keep investors happy .
Belgian brewing giant InBev has made a $ 46 billion takeover bid for Anheuser - Busch ( BUD , Fortune 500 ) .
And the Budweiser maker might do a deal of its own to fend off InBev - it is reported to be talking with Mexican beer company Grupo Modelo .
Verizon ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) is buying wireless company Alltel for more than $ 28 billion , including debt .
Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) is scooping up EDS ( EDS , Fortune 500 ) for $ 12.6 billion .
So the mergers and acquisitions market , despite all the dreary news about the economy and Wall Street , is still alive and well .
That 's likely to continue in the second half of the year .
" Corporate balance sheets are underleveraged so this is a perfect environment for deals even though all the headlines make you think the world is going to end , " said Robert Profusek , a partner in the merger and acquisitions group with law firm Jones Day .
His firm worked on two high - profile deals that were announced this month - XTO Energy 's ( XTO , Fortune 500 ) $ 4.2 billion purchase of privately held Hunt Petroleum and J.M. Smucker 's ( SJM ) $ 3.3 billion acquisition of the Folgers coffee business from Procter & Gamble ( PG , Fortune 500 ) .
In both cases , large public companies , and not private - equity firms , were the acquirers .
Profusek said he sees more so - called strategic mergers taking place in the next few months since it is getting tougher for private - equity companies to raise debt to fund deals in these volatile credit markets .
Profusek argues that since many companies outside of the banking sector have ample amounts of cash and low debt loads , they are going to be more likely to look to mergers as a way to grow their businesses .
Others agree .
" I would n't be surprised to see more M&A .
With valuations this attractive , if companies have the wherewithal to make deals , they can get done , " said Bill Stone , chief investment strategist for PNC Wealth Management .
" For the right deal , companies can get funding put together .
As a whole , companies outside the financial sector are in extremely good shape as far as their debt levels .
Rarely have companies been in this good shape in an economic downturn , " Stone added .
It also helps that the private - equity firms are not as able to outbid public companies these days .
" For larger deals , private - equity firms have been negatively impacted by the retrenchment on the debt side .
And the view is that with private - equity less able to pay big premiums , strategic players are in a better position to make deals , " said Jeffery Bistrong , managing director and head of the technology group for Harris Williams & Co. , an investment bank focused on deals involving mid-sized companies .
Bistrong said that he expects more deals in the red - hot energy sector , as well as in tech and in healthcare .
Profusek also thinks a lot more energy and healthcare deals are likely , as well as more mergers in infrastructure .
Other factors that may fuel mergers are the weak dollar and the upcoming presidential election .
Profusek said he 's surprised that more European companies have yet to take advantage of the strong euro to make bids for American firms .
But the InBev offer for BUD could be a sign of more cross - border takeovers to come .
" We should see more non-U.S. deals of U.S. companies because of the dollar , " he said .
As for the election , there is has been some speculation that mergers may face tougher antitrust review if Obama wins .
But Bistrong said that he does n't think that will really be the case .
However , he sees more mergers taking place in the third and fourth quarters because he believes that corporate taxes are likely to be higher under either an Obama or McCain administration than they are currently .
" There is general consensus among our clients that regardless of who wins , taxes will go up .
So that has been driving deals . "
Add all that up and you can make the case for stocks to rally in the second half of the year .
And as I 've stressed in several recent columns , there is n't a disconnect between what happens on Wall Street and what happens on Main Street .
Stocks are n't just for rich people in an era where 401 ( k ) s and discount brokerages are prevalent .
Anything that big companies can do to strengthen their position in the global market is a good thing since it eventually could lead to more job growth , wage gains and higher consumer confidence .
" Mergers usually are a harbinger of better things overall in the economy , " Profusek said .

The Quest for Perfect iPhone Earbuds
Yeah , I love my iPhone .
I use it more than any other gadget .
So a good pair of earbuds is critical .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A rocket hit the BBC office in Baghdad on Friday but no one was wounded in the attack , the British broadcaster said .
Patrick Howse , the BBC bureau chief in the Iraqi capital , said the rocket left a hole around 1 meter by 1.5 meters in the roof of the office .
“ At 14:45 local time ( 7:45 a.m. EDT ) , a rocket struck the roof of the BBC Baghdad bureau .
It caused structural damage but no one was injured , ” Howse said .
Militants have stepped up rocket and mortar attacks in Baghdad in the past month since the government launched a crackdown on Shi’ite militias .
Many are aimed at the Green Zone government and diplomatic compound but often miss .
Whether in Canada or the Caribbean , tree leaves do n't have to worry about the temperature outside — they have their own built - in climate control that always aims to keep them comfortable , a new study finds .
The long - standing view of plant biologists was that the temperature of a photosynthesizing leaf would be the same as that of the surrounding air .
But in a survey of 39 tree species ranging over 50 degrees of latitude across North America ( between Puerto Rico and Canada ) , biologists at the University of Pennsylvania found that tree leaves stay at a nearly constant temperature while they 're converting sunlight and carbon dioxide into food .
The study , detailed in the June 12 issue of the journal Nature , finds that tree photosynthesis most likely occurs when a leaf 's temperature is about 69.8 degrees Fahrenheit ( 21.4 degrees Celsius ) , with the latitude and average growing - season of the plant 's environment playing little , if any , role in its temperature .
Instead , the leaves likely have physiological and structural adaptations that help them stabilize their internal systems ( we humans do this when we sweat or shiver in response to hot and cold temperatures to maintain our body temperature ) .
This discovery comes as something of a surprise to biologists .
" It is not surprising to think that a polar bear in northern Canada and a black bear in Florida have the same internal body temperature .
They are endothermic [ warm - blooded ] mammals like us and they generate their own heat , " said study team member Brent Helliker of Penn .
" However , to think that a black spruce in Canada and a Caribbean Pine in Puerto Rico have the same average leaf temperature is quite astonishing , particularly since trees are most definitely not endothermic . "
Helliker and his colleagues think that increasing evaporation and leaf angle ( which affects how much sunlight it reflects ) help cool leaves in warm climes , while decreasing evaporation and the clustering of many leaves on each branch help keep leaves warm in colder places .
The results of the study , funded by the Department of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation , have implications for how trees in northern climates will react to global warming :
They might overheat due to mechanisms they have evolved to " keep warm . "
The results also have implications for scientists studying past climate change by measuring the ratios of different isotopes of oxygen ( which have different numbers of neutrons ) in tree - ring cellulose .
The amount of a particular isotope present in the cellulose is influenced by the temperature of the leaves , and scientists had assumed that leaf temperature was the same as the ambient temperature .
The new study has shown this is n't the case .

FORT MADISON , Iowa ( Reuters ) - The Mississippi River surged up through storm drains and flooded part of an eastern Iowa river town on Tuesday as the worst Midwest floods in 15 years ruined cropland and drove up world food prices .
“ There is nowhere for the water to go , so it ’s flooding these areas , ” said Lee County official Steve Cirinna , pointing to pools forming amid historic red- brick houses in Fort Madison .
Volunteers and National Guard troops helped reinforce or raise levees on both sides of the river seeking to protect low - lying businesses , water supplies , and prime farmland planted with increasingly valuable crops .
Across the river from nearby Burlington , Iowa , a levee broke in Gulfport , Illinois , sending muddy waters cascading onto nearby farmland and a few homes .
Although sandbagging was going on , no one was injured .
Authorities closed the river bridge and road .
Corn and soybean prices closed near record highs after millions of acres of U.S. cropland were lost or damaged in the heart of the world ’s largest grain exporter .
Cattle and hog futures prices also hit new highs , with soaring feed costs expected to prompt farmers to cull livestock numbers .
“ We ’ve faced some pressure this year , but there could be greater pressure next year on food inflation when protein prices start to increase , ” said Bill Lapp , a food industry consultant and former chief economist at Conagra Inc .
AID PROMISED
U.S. President George W. Bush promised aid to the stricken region , where farm and business losses are expected to be in the billions of dollars .
Bush will visit Iowa on Thursday .
“ I , unfortunately , have been to too many disasters as president , ” Bush said after a briefing on the flooding .
But Sen. Robert Byrd , a West Virginia Democrat , said little had been done to prevent flooding and Bush had learned nothing from Hurricane Katrina and other disasters .
“ President Bush has asserted that investing in America ’s needs is somehow ‘ wasteful ’ and his budget , which does not add one thin dime for a boost in levee funding , reflects this sentiment , ” Byrd said .
Iowa Gov. Chet Culver said he welcomed word that the U.S. House of Representatives will include $ 2 billion for Midwest flood aid in a spending bill to be discussed this week .
“ The damage will total in the billions of dollars , ” he said .

Meanwhile , hundreds of National Guard troops and volunteers joined in sandbagging efforts across the Midwest .
In addition to Iowa and Illinois , flooding has struck Indiana , Kansas , Missouri , Minnesota and Wisconsin .
“ We have quite a wall of water coming our way , ” said John Spring , mayor of Quincy , Illinois .
“ Flooding is all part of life along the river ... but this time we are better prepared for it . ”
The main cities along the affected stretch of river -- Quincy , and Keokuk and Burlington , Iowa -- perch on bluffs or hillsides .
The cities ’ drinking water and some businesses remain at risk as receding flood waters in Iowa and elsewhere flow rapidly southward .

FINANCIAL LOSSES MOUNT
Comparisons have been made to the major 1993 Midwest floods that caused more than $ 20 billion in damage and 48 deaths .
This month ’s inundation has caused a few deaths , with Iowa hardest hit .
But the physical damage has yet to be totaled .
Corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade soared above $ 8 a bushel for the first time on Monday and stayed near there on Tuesday amid fears midwestern farmers will not be able to grow anything on as many as 5 million acres .
The closing of the mid-Mississippi River to barge traffic is costing freight carriers $ 1 million or more per day .
“ In 1993 , there were months of delays , ” said Larry Daily , president of Alter Barge Line Inc in Bettendorf , Iowa .
“ This time , it ’s going to be shut down two weeks if we do n’t get any more rain -- longer if it rains again . ”
The Mississippi River is the main channel for grain flowing from farms in the Midwest to export terminals at the Gulf of Mexico .
It carried 68 million tonnes of farm goods in 2006 .
The problems add up to more food inflation for not just U.S. consumers , but also dozens of countries that buy U.S. grain .
The United States exports 54 percent of the world ’s corn , 36 percent of its soybeans and 23 percent of its wheat .
The weather was cooperating , with only a slight chance of thunderstorms in southeastern Iowa on Wednesday .
AreoVironment is building the world 's smallest UAV , called the Nano Air Vehicle , that has moving wings instead of a propeller or engine .
DARPA has given the company $ 636,000 and six months to demonstrate an ultra-small UAV that will be under three inches long and under 10 grams .

The concept for the project came about through a $ 1.7 million " Phase One " brainstorming contract .
Apparently unaware of the existence of birds , DARPA decided that this innovative and classy new idea was worth pushing through to development and handed over the second wad of cash this week .
The Nano Air Vehicle is part of an apparent trend toward smaller and smaller UAVs , following AreoVironment 's 80 gram , six inch Black Widow and Prox Dynamics ' four inch , 20 gram Black Hornet ( which , thanks to the less literal - minded people at PD , does not fly like an actual insect ) .
[ Ares ] - By John Herrman
AUSTRALIANS are now the second - longest - living people on earth with falling death rates for cancer , heart disease , stroke and injury , but the indigenous population continues to die earlier .
The latest comparative study of the nation 's overall health by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare ( AIHW ) - the government body responsible for compiling health statistics - shows that a baby born in Australia today can expect to live for 81.4 years , with men expected to live for 79 years and women for almost 84 .
Australians ' life expectancy is bettered only by the Japanese at 82.2 years .
Photo : James Brickwood
But according to the Australia 's Health 2008 report , indigenous people continue to trail in life expectancy and mortality rates .
" Not all groups within the Australian community are so fortunate - among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples , life expectancy at birth is around 17 years less , " the report says .
Scalpel , Sponge , Robot Arm Please Surgeons say robotic heart bypass surgery is easier on the body .
BALTIMORE , May 27 , 2008  -- Roger Suter said he had no idea what was happening to him .
Chest pains ?
He thought he had bronchitis .
He said he was floored -- " pretty bummed " -- when the doctor told him he needed multiple bypass surgery .
Coronary bypass is a common operation in America but a drastic one , too .
To reach the heart and replace the blocked blood vessels that supply it , surgeons have to cut open one 's breastbone .
But at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore , doctors have been trying an alternative : a system known as da Vinci .
Instead of opening a patient 's chest , surgeons make a few small incisions to insert tiny robot arms .
" There 's a lot of invasion that goes along with traditional heart surgery , " said Dr. Robert Poston , who helped pioneer robotic bypass surgery at Maryland and has recently become chief of cardiac surgery at Boston Medical Center .
" If you can avoid all that , and go in between the ribs , not crack any bones , then that is one less thing you have to heal up . "
Roger Suter was one of Poston 's first patients , a year and a half ago .
When Poston offered him the chance to take part in the experiment , Suter said he found the decision easy .
" Sounded as if there was some risk , but the benefits outweighed the risk all the way around , " Suter said .
Poston and a Maryland colleague , Dr. Bartley Griffith , said they believe robotics could make a major difference in bypass surgery , but until now , they lacked the data to persuade their colleagues .
At a meeting of the American Surgical Association , they reported that the first hundred patients on whom they operated did very well .
They spent three fewer days , on average , in the hospital .
They needed about a third as many blood transfusions .
The less - invasive surgery was of special benefit to high - risk patients -- those who suffered from diabetes , lung disease , obesity or other problems that made them poor candidates for a major operation .
And a year after surgery , 99 percent still had clear arteries , compared with 80 percent of patients who had conventional " open " bypass surgery .
" It 's an incredible difference than the usual patient who has bypass surgery , who , by and large , if they 're active at all at work , have to take off at least nine weeks , " Griffith said .
While robotically assisted surgery has become common in other fields , it has not been widely adopted by heart surgeons .
One doubter wrote a commentary in a medical journal titled " Robotics in Cardiac Surgery : the Emperor 's New Clothes . "
" Do we need a robot to do it ?
Does a robot really improve things ? " asked Wini Hayes , the head of Hayes Inc. , a firm that analyzes the costs and benefits of new medical technologies .
" It 's a big investment for a hospital to put in a robotic device , and it might be wise to slow the pace of dissemination until some of these things are sorted out , " she said .
Some doctors said robotic systems are useless for many patients who may have blockages in hard - to - reach places .
They said the operation is riskier , and the equipment is expensive : $ 1.3 million for a single operating room .
Hayes said some hospitals might invest in a robotic system because they can advertise that they have it , not necessarily because they believe it is better .
Poston and Griffith said many of those points are valid .
But they argued that patients go home more quickly and return to work sooner -- something welcomed by corporations that face rising costs for medical insurance .
" The upside is that there 's less cost after surgery , " Poston said .
Roger Suter , Poston 's early patient , said he had his operation on a Wednesday and went home four days later , refusing the hospital 's offer of a wheelchair .
" I did n't feel bad , I had no pain , it was great , " he said .
Mosul has become a centre for al - Qaeda fighters displaced from Baghdad
At least 38 people have been killed in two bombings in Iraq .
The first occurred in the town of Karma , west of Baghdad , where a suicide attacker detonated a bomb at a local council meeting , killing at least 20 .
Three US marines and two interpreters were among those who died in the attack - the third against a local branch of the Iraqi government in a week .
Hours later , a car bomb in the northern city of Mosul left at least 18 people dead and dozens wounded .
In Karma , police said the bomber entered the municipal government building through a back door , but it was unclear how he managed to evade security for the meeting .
It has gotten quieter , but that does n't make these losses any easier .
US military spokesman Steve Stover Those killed are reported to include the head of the local tribal council , and members of a neighbourhood patrol force opposed to al - Qaeda .
Sunni tribal leaders in Karma and elsewhere have turned against militants as part of the so - called Awakening movement .
US losses US authorities they they suspect al - Qaeda in Iraq was behind the Karma bombing .
The attack comes days before US troops are to hand over security responsibility to Iraqis in Anbar .
The number of American troops killed in Iraq this week has now risen to 11 after the US military said one soldier was killed by a roadside bomb in eastern Baghdad earlier on Thursday .
The soldier was killed by what is known as an explosively formed penetrator - a powerful bomb believed to come from Iran and which is frequently used by Shia extremists .
" The level of violence has dropped dramatically , " said US military spokesman Lt Col Steve Stover .
" It has gotten quieter , but that does n't make these losses any easier . "
But he said militants " are constantly thinking of ways that they can undermine us , undermine the government , undermine the Iraqi security forces " .
The figure for US military dead is 26 so far in June - less than the average last year but more than the 19 who died in May , the lowest monthly tally since the 2003 US - led invasion of Iraq .

What are these ?
By Sean Coughlan
BBC News , education reporter
Cheats are more likely to get a verbal warning than expulsion University students who are caught submitting plagiarised work are very rarely expelled , shows a survey .
A study found only 143 students caught cheating were expelled out of 9,200 cases - despite almost all universities threatening expulsion as a sanction .
Researchers warned of " inconsistent " penalties , the most common sanction imposed being to re-submit work .
The study of 86 UK universities also found a much higher rate of plagiarism among postgraduate students .
The report , from the Higher Education Academy and Joint Information Systems Committee , shows that despite the repeated warnings to students not to cheat by using someone else 's work , those caught are unlikely to face particularly severe penalties .
More than 98 % of students caught cheating were allowed to stay at their university - even though some of these students had been caught before .
Caught twice Almost eight out of a hundred students caught plagiarising had already been caught on previous occasions .
" Concerns that the application of penalties for student plagiarism is inconsistent across the higher education sector would appear to be upheld by the findings of this research , " says the report .
There have been widespread concerns about students copying work from the internet or buying essays from online essay writing services .
This study , which does not name any of the institutions which have provided data , found that the threat that cheating students would not be awarded a degree was rarely applied .
Instead , the most common penalty was to have to re-submit work , with a cap on the mark that could be achieved .
The second most common sanction was a reprimand .
Other consequences for those caught plagiarising were an " informal " warning , a lowered mark or having to re-submit work without any capping on the mark .
Three times as many students were given an " informal warning " after being caught than were expelled .
This study also found that plagiarism was more frequent in postgraduate courses .
" It was surprising to observe that the recorded level of plagiarism among postgraduate students was so much higher than the recorded level among undergraduate student , " says the report .
Across the universities as a whole , the cheating rate was about seven cases for every thousand students .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
Plagiarism is rife and many lecturers turn a blind eye to the problem .
Systems make it hard and require considerable effort to prove and put a case through the system .
I was in a situation where nine students copied course work off each other , my Head of Department was n't interested , as overseas students pay the wages .
I was told not to pursue the case , if you know what 's best for you .
Ian , Edinburgh , Scotland
As always the impulse is to blame the system for not being harsh enough .
Frankly , you try expelling a student who has rich parents and powerful lawyers behind them .
I caught a student red - handed who had paid someone else to write their course work for them but I could not get her expelled as it was blatantly obvious she would have challenged such a decision in the courts and we could not absolutely prove that what she had done was not simply " misinterpret the rules regarding help " .
It is not the lecturers ' fault in this matter , or at least , it is their fault only insofar as they sometimes set bad assignments which are possible to plagiarise .
As with everything else to do with education , the context is set by the government , and frankly , universities have been left to sink or swim here with no guidance or support whatsoever from Whitehall .
Andrew Whitworth , Hebden Bridge I have been caught plagiarising before and received a mere warning , even though university policy dictates that plagiarising is an expellable or at least suspendable offense .
Lecturers do n't want the hassle of paper work and it looks bad on the University if a student fails - one must remember that a university is a business and there to make money .
Jack D , Kingston Looking at the issue from a student 's point of view ; Universities do not place enough emphasis on referencing of other peoples work .
Obviously we have to find information from somewhere therefore we need to read other 's work .
We also need to make clear where we got this information from , but many students are n't taught how to reference adequately , or the use of computer programs to help them .
They rarely hold course - wide classes on referencing , opting instead for cheaper seperate courses that need to be signed up for .
These usually have 30 places on them and are ran 3 - 4 times a year .
Clearly not adequate when you have student numbers of several thousand .
Paul , England Before I had learned the correct way to give attribution , I accidently plagarised and was disciplined with a warning at college .
I was horribly embarrassed and never made that mistake again .
The colleges I attended had strict honor codes and the one individual ( a top student ) who was found to have intentionally cheated on a test was reported by classmates and harshly judged as all were working very hard and it was quite competitive .
I would think that a culture of cheating would undermine moral .
K.C. , Boston , Ma USA I am the Head of a University Department .
Please be in no doubt , I and all my colleagues would not hesitate to expel all cheats , who contrary to Paul 's disengenuous posting , are given full information on how to avoid cheating .
The problem is - funding .
If we expel a student we have to spend hours dealing with spurious appeals and ultimately lose income .
Why should we do that ?
I have just had an appeal entered because I had some other essays from the cheating student on my desk when I interviewed him / her .
Of course , the University has dismissed the appeal , but it all takes time and money .
I regret to say that the attitude amongst staff is now tending towards ' Let them in , give them a degree ( any degree ) , collect payslip , go home . '
The solution is threefold - to increase funding for Universities , to pay students a grant ( because at the moment they say ' we are customers , we are paying for our degrees ' ) , and , to cut the number of students .
Many of our students do not really want to be here and they are not really capable of learning that which we endeavour to teach them .
For many students education has become an obligation rather than a right , or , more strictly speaking , a privilege .
Head of Department , UK
As a postgraduate student who helps with teaching undergraduates , I have found the plagiarism issue extremely difficult .
Many students , particularly those from other countries , simply do not understand the principle of formulating an argument supported by referenced evidence .
They instead , scour the resources available for the ' correct ' answer , and often do not realise they are committing plagiarism .
I think that these issues should be made more clear , but we should also remember that an important part of university is learning to be self - motivating and self - directed .
Students should not be spoon - fed their degrees .
Laura Mitchell , Lancaster , UK I along with three of my friends was caught copying coursework from someone else .
Others also did this but didnt get caught .
The tutor ( looking back now ) was quite cool about it .
He did n't make a federal case about it , but instead just gave us zero marks for the assignment .
He could have taken it further but did n't which I was glad of .
One of my colleagues had to re sit the module again because the zero mark put them below the pass mark for the module .
One thing we learned about the episode was that yes , we were let off leniently , but if we ever did it again , we knew we were in trouble and none of us did do it again .
Spatel , Leicester
In response to Paul 's comment regarding referencing , I am a postgraduate student who teaches undergraduate courses and feel that plagiarism cannot be entirely blamed on lack of education on referencing .
Students are told time and time again about how to reference correctly .
In my department , we constantly refer students to the departmental guide to writing essays ( which includes a substantial section on referencing ) , the library runs essay skills sessions ( which are poorly attended ) an I even printed a copy of a referencing guide and gave it to each of my students .
Even with all this , we still get plagiarism , and with most of the cases I have seen , it has not been a mere matter of bad referencing .
As tutors , we can only help students so much , and we must remember that these kids are at university now and they should n't be wet - nursed .
If we provide them with information as to where to go to learn how to reference , whether it be the departmental website , or within the course documentation , then they should go and find it out themselves , they are all at least 18 after all .
Lisa , Leeds Plagiarism serves the interests of both the universities and the students .
It allows the weaker students to pay their fees and get through the course without too much difficulty .
Some academic staff try to address the issue but as several commentators have made clear in doing so they face a very adverse reaction from their employer .
You do not enhance your promotion prospects by uncovering such cases .
Students are all too ready to take legal action and university staff know that they will not be backed up by the employer .
Jane Smith , London when I was at university studyin law a group of 5 students all copied off each other and admitted to buying essays and using older siblings work with the mistakes corrected .
They all came out with first degrees .
The lecturers were aware that it was going on , that the work submitted was not consistent with their work in class or exams but did nothing .
I came out with a respectable 2:1 having earned it by my own hard work .
I am now in a job that pays well above average for the area I am and have shown my capabilities - so far none of these five have actually got either a training contract or a well paid job - one must assume that they peform very badly at interview , as not having actually completed the work themselves , they probably have no idea of the issues and can not give a good enough account of themselves to prospective employers to convince the employers their first is justified ...
Cheeters will be found out at some point that actually matters !
anon , Coventry , UK
It appears that our department is harsh when it comes to plagiarism .
We give the student a zero on the work , with a right to appeal ( very few are ever overturned ) .
There is no warning system , and no right to resubmit .
After reading about this report , I expect that our central administrators will tell us that we are out of line with the academic community and that we need to lighten up .
J.M. , Wales
Surely the fact that there are a range of punishments , from warnings to expulsion , is a good thing .
As a lecturer I see examples of plagiarised work which range from the poor use of quotations through to deliberate attempts to cover the fact that large chucks are copied .
We have a proper system for dealing with these and every offence is recorded , so repeated offenders can expect the punishments to become rapidly more serious .
The idea that you get expelled for a first offense , especially having been taught in some schools that copying is a good thing , is just stupid .
Andrew , Birmingham , UK I have taught in the USA for many years , as well as in the UK .
In the USA plagiarism is taken far more seriously -- failing the course is the least you can expect .
This is in spite of the fact that there is a culture of litigation and universities often are run as businesses .
The difference is that acedemics in the US have vitually complete control over the courses they teach .
Here numbskull adminstrators tie our hands .
As in other part of public service , the answer is simply to let qualified professionals do their job without interference .
Senior Lecturer , UK I am due to graduate from uni next month .
The uni I went to have a high number of overseas students and is heavily reliant on the income generated from overseas students fees .
In almost every exam I had with overseas students several students could clearly been seen to be cheating - with bits of paper in their dictionaries , sometimes full sheets with pre-written answers on them .
However , the staff seemed to turn a blind eye and ignored complaints from student about the situation .
In one instance a number of students did have their dictionaries removed .
However , they were allowed to continue with the exam and no disciplinary action followed .

What are these ?
The folks at the New Zealand Book Council have created a truly ingenious way to read more at work .
Read At Work turns your desktop into a full screen , realistic PC looking desktop with folders , start button , recycle bin , the works .
The kicker is the all the folders contain writings of famous authors and New Zealand locals .
And , keeping in mind that you 're reading at work , these stories are displayed in a convenient PowerPoint format .
Hence your superiors wo n't know what you 're really doing .
This particular screen shot here is from Edgar Allan Poe 's poem " A dream . "
On the site there are short stories by Wilde , Fitzgerald , Twain , Wolfe , Tolstoy and more .
Famous poems by Dickenson , TS Elliot , Poe and more .
They 've also got a personal favorite of mine , Orwell 's " Animal Farm . "
The cover page of it , shown here , is just freaking brilliant !
Or maybe I 've seen too many stupid Powerpoint presentations in my life so I find it funny .
But alas , my description of read at work is not doing the site full justice .
So stop what you 're doing and go read .
Who 's gonna know ?
What a concept !
Those who cannot afford bail may wait months or even years for their day in court .
Proposition 25 would force judges to keep inmates in custody rather than risk them reoffending .
Where is the public outrage and anger for the racism that exists in our current Constitution ?
Who in America is protesting against our racist Constitution ?
No one .

High Gas Prices : The Environment ’s Best Friend
Are you driving less than you used to ?
As Dubner blogged last week , Americans logged 11 billion fewer miles on the road in March of this year than they did in March 2007 .
That contributed to a cut of 9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted by the U.S. in the first quarter of 2008 .
The rise of gasoline prices , coming at a time when most Americans are tightening their belts , has led to a spike in demand for public transit — leading the Philadelphia Inquirer to wonder whether or not the bell is tolling for America ’s car culture .
At the very least , the lean economy might make anti-driving incentives , like those in Seattle , more inviting .
Was Levitt right about the benefits of high gas prices after all ?
Through the course my life , I 've had a few family members in and out of various hospitals , the amazing thing about this , the food always sucks .
Can anyone explain this one to me ?
Sure , I can see why patient food would suck , they have to supply it for free to every patient they have , so it 's understandable that they would want to save money .
Now , if I 'm going to go to their cafeteria , and pay 10 bucks for a Grilled Cheese , why would I want the bread to be stale and the cheese to be uncooked ?
I do n't , but somehow , that 's always how it ends up .
Or I always have the option of going somewhere close like a McDonalds or something of that nature , but I can't bring it back into the room to spend time with my family member , because they do n't allow food past 5 feet inside the door .
The best part is , hospitals will always be able to get away with this , if it was any corporation , you would see a company change it , and then bring in loads and loads of business , the problem , where ever you happen to be when you get hit by a truck , that 's where they ambulance is taking you .
At least in Phoenix , it 's law that the driver is required to take you to the nearest hospital to your location , no matter how much you or your family members ask otherwise .
Make sure to think of that next time you 're choosing a house , if you have an accident there and need to be rushed by ambulance to a hospital , where are you going ?
My girlfriends mother went to urgent care to have a rash looked at , they advised her that it was MRSA ( Lovely little infection ) that she contracted while at the hospital with her son , and that they would like to get an ambulance to take her to the hospital to get it treated , she politely declined , as the nearest hospital was Paradise Valley Hospital in PHX , and the place is a waste of space .
( The doctors actually lost her when her family was looking for her a few years back , how do you LOSE a patient ? ) .
Thus driving her infected self to another hospital 10 miles away to John C Lincoln Hospital .
While I 'm on the topic of hospital complaints , someone tell me why I should pay to park there ?
I show up , I 'm in enough emotional distress as I have someone I care about in the hospital and you crazy people want me to pay $ 1 - $ 5 a day for parking .
Screw that noise .
So there ya have it folks , I 'm sure everyone hates hospitals for one reason or another , my reason is not because sick people are there , it 's because they suck in general .
How about you folks leave some comments ?

Mushy - Headed America
then
Who 's Going to Save Us ?
voluntarily give
Former Air Force Colonel and Pentagon official Karen Kwiatkowski -- who was the key whistleblower who revealed that the Pentagon had a special division producing cooked intelligence on Iraq -- recently wrote :
Is she right ?
Well , there are some indications that America as envisioned by the the Constitution and the Founding Fathers does n't just .
Is not merely , or , or .
But rather , there are indications that America is already dead .
That we lost .
That its over
Is it really that bleak ?
I 'm not sure .
But I do know that the very mushy - headed optimism of many Americans blinds them to the fact that their own government could be ruthless enough to create baseless propaganda , manipulate intelligence , and pull off false flag attacks on American and allied citizens .
I believe that hope is vitally important .
But if we do n't see the situation as it really is , then we just have our heads up in the clouds then and we 're not standing on the ground .
We first have to see things as they are , anduse the power of hopefulness .
For example , if you do n't discover that your house has mold , you can't fix it and make it healthy .
If your doctor does n't tell the patient he has cancer , the patient has no chance of getting better .
If you put all of your eggs in a basket without noticing there is a hole in the bottom , you 're going to lose your eggs .
And unless we acknowledge when something we like is broken , we can't fix it or -- if beyond repair -- build a new one .
Albert Einstein said " Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . "
If we do the same thing over and over , and it has n't worked , we should wake up and acknowledge it is n't working .
Otherwise , we can not fix it .
America of the Founding Fathers and the Constitution is not yet dead . . . but that it is mortally wounded .
Instead of separation of powers , we have a tyrannical executive branch .
Instead of a free market economy , we have massive subsidies , credits , manipulation of the stock market , and other things which skew the system so that there is not a level playing field .
The leaders we have now and the way things work are wholly corrupt .
The structures are rotten and moldy , and have to be ripped out and rebuilt .
The pipes are clogged , and nothing will move unless they are totally cleaned out .
The neocons and neoliberals , the imperialists and military - industrial complex , the lobbyists and dual loyalists have all cannibalized America to the point that it is hardly breathing .
The drafters of the Constitution would not recognize this place , except perhaps as a repeat of tyranny under the British crown .
America is mortally wounded .
I 'm calling a code blue .
Mad King George and the loyalists in the legislature are not going tous freedom or liberty or allow us any real input and a representative government .
The Supreme Court ( which handed the election to Bush ) is n't going to do it .
Many liberals who still hope that the Democratic congress has some intention of impeaching Bush and Cheney , investigating 9/11 , fixing the voting system , ending the Iraq war , or preventing war against Iran .
They are hopelessly naive .
Did writing letters to our Democratic representatives work to stop the Iraq war ?
Has it worked to force a new 9/11 investigation ?
Is it working to prevent a war against Iran ?
Many people voted for a Democratic congress and then trusted them to fix things .
But they did n't , and it has now become apparent to those paying attention that the Dems are part of the problem .
Those who still naively trust that the Democratic congress members are good folks who are trying to stop the Neocons is blinding them to the fact that the Democrats do n't want to do anything between now and the next election ( and most of the Democratic presidential candidates do n't want to do anything to change things even after the election ) .
On the other side , most Fox news watchers hope that the Iraq war will turn out okay .
Or that the " terrorists " are certain brown - skinned people that we can defeat .
Or that the destruction of liberties in the U.S. is temporary .
Their rose - colored glasses are preventing them from seeing the truth as much as the liberals .
Only massive civil disobedience has the chance to re-start America 's pulse and save our country .
The patient is mortally wounded and the prognosis is grim .
Only heroic measures can save the patient .
Massive civil disobedience is the only thing with the power to re-start the heart of our nation . .

The Odyssey is one of the great works of ancient Western literature , written eight centuries before the birth of Christ and four centuries after the fall of Troy .
Generations of classicists have pored over the many lines of Homer 's epic description of the long journey taken by the hero Odysseus to his home island of Ithaca .
Now two scholars have found evidence to support the idea that one line , in the poem 's 20th book , refers to a total solar eclipse that occurred on 16 April 1178 BC – the day when Odysseus returned home to kill his wife 's suitors .
If true , this would date the fall of Troy itself to precisely 1188 BC .
It takes Odysseus 10 years to reach Ithaca after the 10 - year Trojan war .
During his time away , his young son , Telemachus , has grown into a man and his faithful wife , Penelope , is besieged by unruly suitors desperate to gain her hand in marriage .
The Odyssey is the story of a long and great journey involving the beautiful nymph Calypso – who enslaves Odysseus for seven years as her lover – helpful divinities such as Athena and vengeful gods such as Poseidon .

Odysseus eventually escapes from Calypso , survives a shipwreck where all his compatriots are drowned and is befriended by the Phaeacians , a race of skilled mariners who finally deliver the hero safely to Ithaca , where he takes on the guise of a beggar to learn how things stand at home .
It is during this later phase of The Odyssey that Homer is said to make reference to a total solar eclipse .
The key phrase comes in a speech by the seer Theoclymenus , who foresees the deaths of the unruly young men who sought the hand of Penelope while Odysseus was away .
It ends with the words : " The Sun has been obliterated from the sky , and an unlucky darkness invades the world . "
The idea that The Odyssey refers to a total solar eclipse , when the Moon blocks out the Sun completely , is not new .
It was first suggested by ancient scholars , but it was only in the 1920s that astronomers were able to calculate that such an eclipse over Greece around that time could only have taken place on 16 April 1178 BC .
However , few people were convinced that the passage in The Odyssey was actually a reference to a mythical total solar eclipse , never mind a real one .
It might just have been poetic licence , for instance , especially as Homer is said to have written it several centuries after the events that were said to have unfolded .
But two modern astronomers believe they have convincing evidence to support the 16 April eclipse by analysing other passages in the poem that refer to four other astronomical events that are known to occur quite independently of one another .
Instead of looking at when a solar eclipse occurred in history , as other astronomers had done , they investigated the timing of a new moon , the simultaneous appearance of two stellar constellations in the evening sky , and appearances of the planets Mercury and Venus .
All four phenomena are mentioned in The Odyssey which gave Constantino Baikouzis of the Observatorio Astronomico de La Plata in Argentina , and Professor Marcelo Magnasco , of the Rockefeller University in New York , another way of checking the date when Odysseus is supposed to have returned to his home on Ithaca to kill his wife 's suitors .
For example , six days before the slaughter of the suitors , Homer writes that Odysseus returns with the Star of Dawn , a reference to the planet Venus , which is visible at sunrise .
Odysseus also sets sail to Ithaca 29 - and - a- half days earlier , when the constellations Bootes and Pleiades can both be seen in the twilight sky – stars which were used for navigation by the ancient Greeks .
Magnasco and Baikouzis also point out that the day before the slaughter of the suitors , there is a new moon – a prerequisite for a total eclipse – and 33 days prior to this day Homer may be suggesting that Mercury , described as the god Hermes , is high at dawn and near the western end of its trajectory .
They calculated the pattern in which these four events occurred , from the references mentioned in The Odyssey , and compared them against patterns gleaned from 135 years of astronomical data – nearly 5,000 days .
The result was they found just one date that could have been the fateful day .
It was the same 16 April 1178 BC that was known to have been a total solar eclipse .
" What are the chances of having two different ways of dating the text and both agreeing on the same date ?
We calculated the chances of these two dates agreeing by chance alone is something like one in 50,000 , " Professor Magnasco said .
" Not only is this corroborative evidence that this date might be something important but , if we take it as a given that the death of the suitors happened on this particular eclipse date , then everything else in The Odyssey happens exactly as is described . "
In the time of the ancient scholars , notably Plutarch and Heraclitus , there were suggestions that The Odyssey did refer to a total solar eclipse , a rare and dramatic event that was often taken as an omen .
" Temperatures drop suddenly a few degrees , winds change , animals become restless and human faces may have a striking , exsanguinated appearance in the bluish light , " the two academics write in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We can not say for sure that the events described in The Odyssey really happened , of course , because some of the events are really quite fanciful .
But what we want to do is to get people to go back to the text and have another look , " Professor Magnasco said .
" Under the very large assumption that there was an Odysseus , there were suitors that got massacred , that it indeed took 10 years for Odysseus to get back ... yes , in that case the fall of Troy would have happened 10 years before the death of the suitors , thus in 1188 BC .
The current dating of the destruction layer of Troy VIIa is around 1190 plus / minus a few years . "
One weak spot in the analysis , Professor Magnasco admits , is the idea of linking the appearance of planets with gods , which was a Babylonian invention that dates back to about 1000 BC .
There is no evidence those ideas had reached Greece by the time of Homer , hundreds of years later .
" This is a risky step in our analysis .
One may say that our interpretation of the phenomena is stretching it but , when you go back to the text , you have to wonder , " he said .
" Even though there are historical arguments that say this is a ridiculous thing to think about , if we can get a few people to read The Odyssey differently , to look at it and ponder whether there was an actual date in it , we will be happy . "
Oil bubble will burst soon , says Lehman report
Mumbai :
The oil boom is on its last leg and may last a few months before a clutch of new refineries start operations amid slackening economic growth across the world , consultancy firm and investment bank Lehman Brothers has predicted in a report .
The report said supply is in fact outpacing demand growth even as inventories have been building up for quite some time now .
This announcement must surely come as a huge relief for consumers reeling under high oil prices for some time now .
Tellingly , this news comes only two days after Thomas Boone Pickens , an American billionaire who made a fortune in oil speculation , predicted that oil could reach the $ 150 mark soon .
Justifying his stance , he had said that the current global oil supply of 85 mbpd was well short of the requirement of 87 mbpd .
" When you have 85 billion to cover 87 billion , the price has to go up , " he said .
'' Inventories have been building since the beginning of the year .
We have pretty significant projects starting soon in Saudi Arabia , and large off - shore fields in Nigeria , '' said Michael Waldron , the US bank 's oil analyst .
Saudi Arabia has started production at its 500,000 barrels per day Khursaniya field while the new 1.2 million barrels per day ( mbpd ) Khurais field will start next year , the report pointed out .
Saudi Arabia plans to spend $ 90 billion in oil exploration and production over the next five years , lifting capacity to 12.5 mbpd by the end of 2009 while a clutch of new refineries will add almost eight mbpd of new capacity by 2010 , the report pointed out ..
Reliance Petroleum 's 600,000 bpd refinery at Jamnagar in India also featured in the report .
The facility is to be tested by trial runs in July and expected to be commissioned in September .

Leading world scientists convene in Brazil July 21 - 25 amid growing concern that evaporation and ongoing destruction of world wetlands , which hold a volume of carbon similar to that in the atmosphere today , could cause them to exhale billows of greenhouse gases .
Meeting in the city of Cuiaba on the edge of South America 's vast Pantanal , the largest wetland of its kind , some 700 experts from 28 nations at the 8th INTECOL International Wetlands Conference will prescribe measures urgently needed to better understand and manage these vibrant ecosystems , ranked among the planet 's most threatened , and slow their decline and loss .
Warming world temperatures are speeding both rates of decomposition of trapped organic material and evaporation , while threatening critical sources of wetlands recharge by melting glaciers and reducing precipitation .
Covering just 6 % of Earth 's land surface , wetlands ( including marshes , peat bogs , swamps , river deltas , mangroves , tundra , lagoons and river floodplains ) store 10 - 20 % of its terrestrial carbon .
Wetlands slow the decay of organic material trapped and locked away over the ages in low oxygen conditions .
These waterlogged ( either seasonally or year - round ) areas contain an estimated 771 gigatonnes ( 771 billion tonnes ) of greenhouse gases -- both CO 2 and more potent methane -- an amount in CO 2 equivalent comparable to the carbon content of today 's atmosphere .
" Humanity in many parts of the world needs a wake - up call to fully appreciate the vital environmental , social and economic services wetlands provide -- absorbing and holding carbon , moderating water levels , supporting biodiversity and countless others , " says conference co-chair Paulo Teixeira , Co-ordinator of the Cuiaba - based Pantanal Regional Environmental Programme , a joint effort of the United Nations University and Brazil 's Federal University of Mato Grasso ( UFMT ) , which will host the event .

Says UN Under Secretary - General Konrad Osterwalder , Rector of UNU : " Too often in the past , people have unwittingly considered wetlands to be problems in need of a solution .
Yet wetlands are essential to the planet 's health -- and with hindsight , the problems in reality have turned out to be the draining of wetlands and other ' solutions ' we humans devised . "
If the decline of wetlands continues through human and climate change - related causes , scientists fear the release of carbon from these traditional sinks could compound the global warming problem significantly , says Prof.
Paulo Speller , Rector of UFMT .
Drained tropical swamp forests release an estimated 40 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year .
Drained peat bogs release some 2.5 to 10 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year .
Adds Prof. Speller : " This landmark conference beside the Pantanal will gather an overview of the status of global wetlands , identify knowledge gaps , create greater collaboration and consistency in wetland science worldwide , and offer a plain - spoken policy prescription for decision makers with an appeal to adopt it with urgency . "
German expert Wolfgang
Junk says the impact of climate change on wetlands is small so far compared to the damage caused by poor management at the local level .
" Lessening the stress on wetlands caused by pollution and other human assaults will improve their resiliency and represents an important climate change adaptation strategy , " he says .
" Wetland rehabilitation , meanwhile , represents a viable alternative to artificial flood control and dredging efforts that may be needed to cope with the larger , more frequent floods predicted in a hotter world . "
Prof. Junk , of the Max - Planck - Institute for Evolutionary Biology , notes that maintenance of wetlands is much cheaper than rehabilitation and that poorer countries will have fewer means to rehabilitate their wetlands to cope with climate change .
Wetland - friendly development alternatives must be elaborated in developing countries , therefore , to minimize losses of their many benefits , he says .

He notes too that while pressure on wetlands in poorer countries has risen dramatically in recent years , they have not suffered nearly as much damage as those in the developed world .
Some 60 % of wetlands worldwide -- and up to 90 % in Europe -- have been destroyed in the past 100 years , principally due to drainage for agriculture but also through pollution , dams , canals , groundwater pumping , urban development and peat extraction .
Notwithstanding recent efforts in such countries as Australia and the U.S. ( which has lost 50 million of an estimated 90 million hectares of wetlands 500 years ago ) to protect wetlands and reverse past damage , at a world scale they continue to shrink .
" Wetlands act as sponges and their role as sources , reservoirs and regulators of water is largely underappreciated by many farmers and others who rely on steady water supplies , " says Prof .
Junk .
" They also cleanse water of organic pollutants , prevent downstream flood inundations , protect riverbanks and seashores from erosion , recycle nutrients and capture sediment . "
Typically high in nutrients , wetlands also offer rich habitats for small organisms which feed fish and other water life , which in turn nourish mammals and birds .
Many wetlands feature biodiversity comparable to that of rainforests or coral reefs .
Conference organizers say efficient protection of wetlands requires complex , long term management plans that cover their entire catchment areas , often involving agreements between states or countries .
These agreements need to cover activities that affect wetlands both directly and indirectly , such as the use of water and soils , development , waste treatment and disposal , but also harmonization of environmental legislation for protection of wetlands and all that lives in them .
Background information
( Fortune Magazine ) --
The big foreign - money purchases of stakes in Citigroup , Merrill Lynch , and Morgan Stanley are merely a hint of what 's ahead in 2008 .
Foreign buyers , such as sovereign wealth funds from countries like Kuwait and Singapore , will continue to make headlines by grabbing major U.S. assets this year , and the trend is much broader than investments in Wall Street firms that need a capital infusion .
What 's important to understand is why this is happening - the reasons go beyond what most people realize - and why it may be even more worrisome than it seems .
Such deals were hot even before the bank bailouts .
Foreign buyers set a record last year by purchasing $ 414 billion of U.S. assets - even more than they bought in the wonder year of 2000 .
The usual explanation is that the dollar was cheap , which was certainly an important factor .
But more had to be going on .
Many of the biggest deals were done by Asian or Middle Eastern buyers who already hold much of their wealth in dollars .
Those investors did n't get a discount because of the dollar 's declining value .
In addition , U.S. stocks were hitting record highs through much of last year , so it 's hard to say that American businesses in general were bargains .
Why , then , were foreign buyers so busy ?
The overlooked part of the answer goes back a decade to when Americans started buying a whole lot more from other countries than they were buying from us .
We 'd been running a trade deficit since the 1970s , but it took off in the late 1990s and has been galloping ever since .
All those dollars we send into the world come back to us - some as purchases of our goods and services , and the rest , equal to the trade deficit , as investments .
For many years those investments have been mostly in U.S. bonds , which is the usual pattern in these situations .
After a while , though , foreigners who hold tons of another country 's bonds start to get nervous .
They realize that the government might be tempted to make its debt a little less burdensome by inflating the currency , rendering the foreigners ' holdings less valuable .
So the foreign creditors hedge their bets by buying direct ownership stakes of the debtor country 's assets ( see , for example , much of Argentina 's history ) .
That 's what is happening in America today , and we can expect much more of it for two reasons .
First , the Fed 's rate cuts - four since September - are inflationary and will spook foreign creditors further , spurring more equity buying .
Second , our trade deficit remains massive , probably exceeding $ 700 billion last year ; that 's money that will have to come back as investment in the U.S .
It is n't necessarily bad when foreigners buy chunks of U.S. businesses .
Those ailing Wall Street banks certainly needed the capital .
More broadly , the many lower - profile investments by foreign entities that happen every day are votes of confidence in the U.S. economy , and they create thousands of jobs for Americans .
But here 's why the trend is troublesome , and more so now than ever .
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis , the rest of the world currently owns way more of America ( stocks , bonds , real estate , etc. ) than America owns of the rest of the world , by a margin of $ 2.6 trillion ( as of year - end 2006 ; a 2007 figure is due in July and will be larger ) .
Net foreign ownership is increasing very rapidly ; it has multiplied by a factor of five in just the past decade .
As it grows , we must send more dividends and interest to foreign owners , giving them more money with which to buy more U.S. assets , earning more dividends , and so on .
This compounding effect is small when net foreign ownership is low , but at today 's levels the effect is becoming significant and ever harder to reverse .
Where it leads is grim :
As a nation we eventually cease to be capitalists and become simply wage earners .
As Warren Buffett put it in a prophetic Fortune article more than four years ago , a country that goes too far down this road can be " colonized by purchase rather than conquest . "
That is n't inevitable .
We can turn our situation around by saving more and spending less , and market forces , such as a weakening dollar , will help us do that .
But every day we do n't , the hole we have to climb out of gets a little deeper .
Iceland is an anomalous place .
First , thanks to the Gulf Stream , it is n’t all that icy .
That would be Greenland , named by Erik the Red , the inventor of travel marketing .
That ’s not to say Iceland does n’t have weather — I experienced four seasons in 30 minutes on a visit to the Gullfoss waterfall .
There is an elemental war going on here :
The clouds blot out every bit of light , then the sun stabs through in displays of horrible beauty ; the postcard - perfect mountains look impermeable , but up close , it ’s clear they ’ve been raked by watery claws of snow and rain ; the ubiquitous lava fields wrestle with hummocks of grass and moss .

Depending on your point of view , Iceland was either the last part of Europe to be settled or the first part of North America to see Europeans .
It sits on both continents , astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , where the earth ’s plates are gradually pulling apart , making Iceland a bubbling vessel of magma - heated water .
Since its settlement by Vikings in AD 874 , the country has remained remarkably isolated .
The people — all 300,000 of them , roughly the population of Aurora , Colorado — are as homogeneous as the weather and the terrain are not .
Iceland is Appalachia with different rocks .
Their remoteness , however , seems to have made Icelanders particularly resourceful .
Faced with essentially no arable land , they built greenhouse farms to raise cucumbers and tomatoes and even bananas .
In the fish - rich but almost uninhabitable north , Icelandic fishermen needed special clothing , which spawned 66° North high - tech outerwear , now sold in 15 countries .
Icelanders have even managed to turn their own lack of diversity into an advantage : deCODE Genetics , based in the capital , Reykjavik , has built the largest DNA database of its kind ( on a per capita basis ) to spot disease - causing mutations and use them to develop biotech drugs .
But Iceland ’s primary innovation , the one that puts it on the map for some of the world ’s largest companies , centers on renewable energy .
The country has no coal , no petroleum reserves , and no trees .
( The Vikings leveled the timber centuries ago , leading to this bit of local wit : “ What do you do if you ’re lost in an Icelandic forest ?
Stand up . ” )
Rather than continue to import every calorie of fuel , Icelanders figured out how to heat their homes with their copious geothermal supply ; before long , they were generating geothermal electricity as well .
Today , Iceland imports essentially no coal or oil for heat and power : 70 % of its energy is renewable .
Reykjavik is at the center of this energy vanguard , filling all of its needs from green sources , either geothermal or hydroelectric .
It is here that Iceland ’s ambition becomes clear .
Having shown that it knows what it takes to move from one fuel source to another , this rocky little outpost is ready for something bigger .
“ We would like to be the world ’s laboratory for exploring a carbon - neutral future , ” says Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir , the country ’s foreign minister and former mayor of Reykjavik .
Reykjavik Power , the world ’s largest geothermal heating company , and other local firms already export expertise to markets including China and the United States ( which is the world ’s largest consumer of geothermal power and which hopes to boost that usage exponentially ) .
The next step : Proving that cars can run on something other than gasoline .
That they can run , in fact , on hydrogen .
Energy Island
On my trip to Iceland last November , I became the first person in the world to rent a hydrogen - powered car .
That I could do so was testament to the sheer force of will exerted over 30 years by people like Bragi Árnason .
A now - retired chemist at the University of Iceland , Árnason started arguing back in the 1970s that hydrogen could power cars .
People mocked him , but he weathered the barbs and slowly won converts , including a wisecracking energy physicist named Thorsteinn Sigfusson , who took the hydrogen - fuel concept out of the faculty club and into the market .
Sigfusson helped found Icelandic New Energy ( INE ) , a consortium of energy companies , and was its chairman until recently , when he was asked to run the Icelandic Innovation Institute .
At 6 feet , 4 inches and weighing something like 300 pounds , Sigfusson is part offensive tackle , part Katie Couric .
“ I ’m a people whisperer , ” he says .
Which means he likes to suggest ideas to others and then get out of their way , letting them make it happen .
His affable nature has made him Iceland ’s unofficial ambassador of energy , and he greets groups interested in the country ’s green - energy prowess with gigantic air bear hugs .
“ Welcome , friends , ” he intones in his friendly baritone .
“ Welcome to Energy Island . ”
During a serious presentation about energy physics , he ’ll slip in a playful slide on the diet of an energy society , comparing renewables , oil , and coal to proteins , carbs , and fat .

Sigfusson has done as much as anyone to push hydrogen fuel forward , enough that last year he was named a winner of Russia ’s Global Energy Prize , which rivals the Nobel in payout .
He has a book coming out this spring called Planet Hydrogen : The Taming of the Proton .
Hydrogen is a paradoxical fuel , he says .
But since it is the most plentiful substance in the universe and throws off only water when burned , it has been hailed as the answer to earth ’s dual fossil - fuel problems : dwindling supply and the ballooning greenhouse effect .
So far , though , most hydrogen fuel is still produced either as a by - product of making fossil fuels or by burning them .
In other words , it is n’t much greener than oil .
Thanks largely to the persistence of Árnason , Sigfusson , and their colleagues , Iceland has begun making clean hydrogen fuel on a proto - commercial scale .
As it turns out , that ’s a simple enough proposition given one thing : electricity derived from clean sources such as geothermal , hydroelectric , solar , or wind .
The Shell station off Reykjavik ’s Miklabraut road has been producing hydrogen for almost five years , using green electricity to electrolyze water , splitting off the hydrogen atoms and then storing them at high pressure .
It ’s a zero-emissions process .
So if Iceland can make clean hydrogen ( locals pronounce it with a hard G ) , why ca n’t the rest of us ?
The United States produces enough hydrogen to power 34 million cars , according to the Department of Energy , but 95 % of it starts as natural gas and then is reformed in a nongreen process using steam and high pressure .
( This hydrogen is used largely in refining petroleum and in creating ammonia used in fertilizer . )
Since 1999 , Daimler , Royal Dutch Shell , and Norsk Hydro , the $ 31 billion Norwegian aluminum and energy company ( it spun off its energy business in 2007 ) , have been trying to replicate the Icelandic model .
All three companies are part of INE , which built Shell ’s hydrogen station and sparked a 10 - city hydrogen bus project funded by the European Union and later expanded to Beijing and Perth , Australia .
David Haberman , a longtime investor in hydrogen fuel cells and an early partner in INE , explains that the consortium has already proved three things :
Hydrogen is safer than oil or gasoline ; people are willing and even eager to use hydrogen to fuel their vehicles ; and governments can effectively educate their citizens about an alternative fuel .
None of that was clear in 1999 .
Now the challenge is to roll out this new blueprint to the rest of the world .
Iceland ’s neighbors are already paying attention .
Iceland has been “ an important learning project for us , ” says Per Øyvind Hjerpaasen , VP of hydrogen at Statoil Hydro , which was formed in October 2007 , when the Norwegian state oil company , Statoil , bought Norsk Hydro ’s energy operations and in effect formed the world ’s largest offshore oil - and - gas company .
Hjerpaasen says StatoilHydro and others are adapting those lessons as they build HyNor , Norway ’s hydrogen highway , a string of five or six hydrogen filling stations on the road along the country ’s southern coast .
StatoilHydro will use wind and solar power to produce green hydrogen for these stations ; it ’s also testing a station that uses hydrogen produced from fossil fuels and buries the carbon dioxide — a process that might make hydrogen an option even in places dependent on coal - fired power plants .
Once the Oslo station is built , in 2009 , the hydrogen highway will go on through Sweden and Denmark to Germany , thanks to a project that ’s in the works among the four governments and a dozen major industrial firms , including StatoilHydro .
Meanwhile , INE forges ahead .
Late last year , it helped the local Hertz to start importing Toyota Priuses , including the one I rented , that had been converted to run on hydrogen .
INE will bring up to 40 hydrogen - powered cars to Iceland over the next two years for consumer testing .
And in April , it will launch a whale - watching boat that uses hydrogen to run its auxiliary power system , the first time hydrogen has been used aboard a ship .

Hydrogen ’s Bill Gates
My first trip in the hydrogen Prius — known in the business as an H Prius — was to see one of Sigfusson ’s protégés , Hallmar Halldórs , who runs his new company , Icelandic Hydrogen , in a suburb of Reykjavik .
I set off during rush hour , my heart racing at every rotary for fear of being the first person to crash a hydrogen car .
( They do n’t blow up like the Hindenburg in a collision , but at $ 100,000 a pop , my terror was justified . )
It was just a decade ago that hydrogen cars had room for only a driver — the rest was given over to storing the fuel .
Today , the only visible difference between my H Prius and the regular version is that the spare tire has to sit in the trunk .
After Halldórs checks out my car , he shows off his company .
“ We have a little work to do , ” he says with a grin , ushering me through a door in the machine shop owned by his business partner .
Across the threshold , I find myself standing on a recently poured concrete slab — under a rainy Icelandic night sky .
The 37 - year - old Halldórs — he repaired ship engines before starting his PhD in physics and getting hooked on hydrogen — is well aware of the distance yet to travel .
Still , he may just be hydrogen fuel ’s Bill Gates , circa 1977 : His dream is a refueling station in every garage .
He even has a working prototype , adapted from laboratory equipment , which looks like a PC server , only with tubing and a container for water .
Right now , it can make about 1.5 kilograms of pressurized hydrogen fuel in a day , good for about two - thirds of the capacity of my Prius ’s tanks .
Halldórs ’s four - person company is pursuing a number of other ideas , including the possibility of small - scale filling stations that generate enough hydrogen to fuel three or four cars a day , about one - twentieth the capacity of the Shell station on the other side of Reykjavik .
His partner has built a stainless - steel dispenser prototype .
And Halldórs says he has already sold some related technology to two customers abroad , though he wo n’t name them .
Like any good visionary , Halldórs thinks hydrogen fuel is coming fast .
In fact , he expects there will be a substantial market by 2015 , and not just in Iceland : “ We like to say we will make it happen . ”

Winning investment and interest from outside the country has been perhaps the biggest hurdle .
But there are plenty of others .
H cars still need better fuel cells and a network of filling stations at least as extensive as diesel’s .
Then there ’s the distribution and storage problem :
At high pressure , hydrogen simply seeps through the molecules of conventional steel , so traditional trucks and tanks are useless .
( Scientists are experimenting with things like composite materials , bonding hydrogen to vehicle frames , or using nanoscale storage devices , to get around this problem . )
But as Bill Reinert , national manager in the advanced technologies group for Toyota Motor Sales , points out , hydrogen cars have been seriously researched for only 15 years .
It took Toyota more than 10 years just to sell a million copies of the hybrid Prius — and that ’s for a car that slides right into today ’s fuel infrastructure .
Reinert figures the U.S. government spends $ 16 billion to $ 20 billion , including subsidies , on ethanol .
Toyota alone , he says , spends more on hydrogen research than does the entire U.S. government .
Coming to America Hydrogen ’s appeal in the quest to replace oil is not simply that there ’s so much of it but that it works so well .
“ Hydrogen fuel cells are the only way to get vehicles that perform like a gasoline vehicle , ” says Britta K. Gross , General Motors ’ manager of hydrogen and electrical infrastructure commercialization .
H cars refuel quickly , and they can match gas - powered cars for range .
But — once more for emphasis — there are no emissions .
Oil approached $ 99 a barrel while I was in Iceland .
Back home , the news seems full of hydrogen .
Honda says it will begin a controlled leasing program this year in Southern California for its FCX Clarity fuel - cell car .
GM , desperate to recover its mojo , has rolled out the first phase of Project Driveway , a 100 - car pilot in Los Angeles and New York , which will move on to Washington , D.C. , and eventually Europe and Asia ; select drivers will get a hydrogen - powered SUV , the Equinox , for periods ranging from three months to several years .
To fuel those cars , GM , along with Shell Hydrogen and another large energy company it wo n’t yet identify , is building 10 hydrogen filling stations across the country , including one in the Bronx , not far from Yankee Stadium .
While none of the stations will produce its own hydrogen ( some will come from a green facility in Niagara , New York ) , all are seen as part of a proof of concept .
Gross says that H cars have become far more than an experiment for GM .
While the company plans one more prototype model to succeed the Equinox , it is already gearing up to bring H cars to a dealer near you at a price that wo n’t leave you gasping .
Like Honda , GM has pushed the hydrogen car well past the R&D phase :
While it does n’t quite have a hydrogen - car division , Gross says H cars are now part of GM ’s mainstream organization , with an engineering chief , a vehicle line director , and a manufacturing and marketing staff .
GM plans to be ready to produce them commercially in 2013 .
Gross has been to Iceland twice .
“ It ’s absolutely shaped my thinking on how you do this , ” she says .
She calls the will of the country “ eye- opening , ” and marvels at its ability to get government and industry focused on the same goal , something the United States has failed to do .
The hydrogen economy cannot happen here without such coordination , she says .
INE ’s general manager , Jón Björn Skúlason , agrees , pointing out that one reason Iceland has made such progress is that his outfit manages every aspect of Iceland ’s hydrogen economy , a degree of command and control the United States has n’t even attempted .
Now , says Gross , an ad hoc “ H gang ” of five automakers ( including GM ) , as well as oil companies , hydrogen merchants , and government officials , have started meeting to talk about how America can follow Iceland ’s lead .

Project Driveway ’s focus on just three cities , she explains , is a way of proving the possible .
“ You have to break it apart for anyone who says it ’s a $ 400 billion exercise , ” she insists , “ or you will never get 1 million vehicles out there .
You have to demonstrate what you can do . ”
Even if hydrogen does end up the long - term replacement for oil , there will be bridge fuels along the way .
In fact , the post - oil economy may be a patchwork of local solutions , says Barbara Heydorn , director of the Center of Excellence in Energy at SRI , a California - based research nonprofit .
Heydorn points out that localized markets exist even now , Brazil ’s sugarcane ethanol being a prime example .
Similarly , more than a quarter of the cars in Bangladesh run on natural gas , as do 1.6 million cars in Argentina and almost 500,000 in Italy .
“ Just as there are regional variations for what cars are available , ” she says , “ fuel will be one more piece of the puzzle automakers will have to accommodate . ”
Where , exactly , hydrogen will fit is n’t yet clear .
But governments , automakers , and people worldwide are increasingly motivated to figure it out .
In Reykjavik , over a horse - meat lunch at the iconic Hotel Holt , Thorsteinn Sigfusson reflects on what he has wrought so far .
To him , it ’s clear that oil is doomed .
“ Hydrocarbons are a mishap , a sigh in time , ” he says .
“ We provided the scenario for testing hydrogen .
We ’ve shown that it is the ultimate fuel .
Nobody doubts that now . ”
The internet is a powerful tool that has helped people across the world achieve their dreams and connect in ways they never thought possible .
Through the internet , people can make friends across oceans and communities can rise out of nothing .
Yet , the internet can be dangerous , too .
Hackers are inventing new cyber security risks every day and it ’s up to a dwindling number of experts to protect average users .
By crafting malicious code , building complex networks , or simply lying about who they are — hackers can steal people ’s information .
With that information , they can do untold amounts of damage .
They may steal a person ’s identity and use their financial information to go on an all - expense - paid shopping spree .
They can pretend to be someone else on social media , smearing their reputation and alienating them from their friends .
Without cybersecurity experts to protect users , the internet would be a terrifying weapon for people who want to do harm .
These experts ca n’t be everywhere at once , though !
You need to put in your share and try to protect yourself from an ever - growing number of cybersecurity risks .
And to learn how to do that , keep reading below !
Cyber Security Risks Do n’t Need to Built With Complex Code
When people imagine what a hacker ’s life is like , they usually imagine hundreds of computer screens with lines of code spewing from them .
Average users tend to think that hackers are simply evil geniuses who take any opportunity they can to steal more and information .
Yet , that could n’t be farther from the case .
Most of the time , hackers are average people who may be slightly more technologically fluent than their neighbors .
They may understand a little bit of code , or even the basics of networking !
But they usually are n’t the geniuses that media makes them up to be .
Cybersecurity firms like Gray Tier Technologies understand this ; hackers simply have access to dangerous hacking tools and the will to use them .
When trying to stop hackers , you ’re not up against supervillains using the internet for evil .
You ’re up against average people who want to steal something form you .
Sometimes , All it Takes is a Good Liar to Break Into an Account
Several hacking techniques come to the oldest and greatest kind of deception : lying .
Most of the time , hackers get access to accounts and steal information simply by lying who they are .
It ’s the methods that they use to convince users to believe that can get complicated .
Hackers may pretend to be representatives from trusted companies like Google or Facebook to trick people into handing over passwords .
They may spoof an email saying that you need to reset your password .
They may even recreate an official website that looks exactly like Google or Facebook .
Yet , as long as you take steps to make sure things are copacetic and approach the internet with a healthy amount of doubt , you will be safe .
Phishing : Try Not to Get Reeled in By Hackers
The most common type of hacking attempt is also the most effective — phishing .
The goal of a phishing attack is to get someone to hand over their personal information , such as passwords or even social security numbers .
Hackers get people to do this by lying about who the victim is dealing with .
Hackers may give themselves an air of authority by spoofing email addresses from official sources , or by calling a person directly .
They may pretend to be company representatives or even government officials .
They may even create websites that look and feel official when in reality they ’re designed to steal your information .
The best way to protect yourself from these kinds of attacks is to simply be careful of who you give information to .
Do n’t give someone your password just because they ask for , and if something feels off with a website , verify that it ’s the right one !
Phishing Attacks Are Getting More and More Complex
Phishing attacks have led to high - profile controversies over the last few years .
A phishing attack gave hackers access to sensitive political databases and allowed them to manipulate a national election .
Banks have lost millions due to phishing attacks , and companies have accidentally leaked user data due to these attacks .
If you suspect that you may have fallen victim to a phishing attack , there ’s no time to waste !
Make sure to change all of your passwords and to alert your financial institution .
That way , they can keep an eye out for strange behavior from your accounts and possibly find the hacker .
Disinformation is Spreading and Manipulating How People Act
One of the newest kinds of cyber security threats does n’t involve code at all .
It involves social media and the way people perceive the world around them .
Hackers have discovered that they can manipulate social media algorithms to make personal agendas to seem legitimate online , and trick people into believing them .
To do this , they may start posting a simple tweet on Twitter .
Then , they may hire a botnet to pour likes and retweets into it at high speeds , making the tweet seem agreeable .
Then , it may appear on people ’s feeds as Twitter ’s algorithm recognizes it as something people enjoy , prompting actual people to elevate it even higher .
For a single tweet , this may not cause so much damage .
Yet , a sustained disinformation campaign can make almost anything seem legitimate and believable .
And when people believe in the absurd , the world around them can seem increasingly dangerous , causing them to panic out of fear .
The goal of a disinformation campaign is n’t to steal anything except people ’s hearts and minds .
With those , hackers can control the entire digital landscape and achieve any personal agenda they may have .
Hackers Are Smart , But You Can be Smarter
There are several cyber security risks to stay aware of ; gone are the days of simple viruses and trojan horses .
Now , to be safe on the internet , you need to develop a sense for when something may seem askew and trust yourself enough to act on it .
Hackers no longer rely on complex code to do harm — they rely on people ’s innate gullibility .
Just try not to be gullible , and it does n’t matter how many new cyber security risks emerge .
You will be safe .
And that means staying informed !

Prime minister says world should not be taken by surprise as it was with coronavirus
" Oh , hey , that 's weird . "
One of Initrode Global Insurance 's accountants spotted an error on a printout of the previous day 's sales report during her daily review .
She dug through her records and tried to isolate the small , but still troubling , discrepancy between the totals .
After reading through several previous days ' reports and asking around , she could n't find anything that could 've caused the error .
She circled the incorrect number , wrote the correct total , and took it to her boss 's office .
" Hey , that 's weird , " her boss said .
After checking and rechecking , it was clear — this was a problem with the report generated by the big iron ( an IBM mainframe ) .
After making the rounds in accounting and then through IT , it was ultimately put on a low level programmer 's desk for him to investigate .
It was the mid 1960s , so naturally all of Initrode 's applications were built in COBOL .
The archaic punchcard system was in the process of being phased out in favor of a newer magnetic tape reel technology .
For two years the system had performed well , and aside from the usual kinks when the system was first rolled out , there had n't been any issues like this in months .
The programmer did all he could to find the problem , but was n't able to locate it .
After five days , still no resolution , but at least the issue had n't shown up again .
Everyone reasoned that it was a fluke , maybe a card with a hanging chad or a one - time read error .
Sadly , a day or two later ( exactly one week week after the issue had originally appeared ) , the same thing happened .
Another negligible difference between accounting 's paper reports and the computer 's output .
The developer went to the card bin to verify that none of the cards were folded , spindled , or mutilated — nothing .
He checked the numbering on the cards , and again , nothing .
Another programmer was assigned to investigate , and between the two of them , they still could n't figure it out .
There was no apparent relationship to the job 's parameters and the amount of the discrepancies .
None of the equipment , code , or staff had changed , no accounting procedures were different , but this problem would still appear every week .
After a year , there was still no fix .
Ashamed , the developer vowed to work late the next Thursday night , promising himself he would n't leave the office until it was fixed .
He pored over every ENVIRONMENT DIVISION , every FILE SECTION , every WORKING - STORAGE SECTION .
He checked every variable to make sure that the decimals were in the right place , that no precision was lost in any output anywhere , and that all data files were closed properly .
At his wit 's end and cursing the 1960s for not having invented Red Bull yet , he leaned back in his chair in frustration .
At that moment , a member of the cleaning crew came walking through the door .
She politely said " hi " and asked if her cleaning would disturb him .
Happy to have another human being in the room , the young developer invited her in .
" No , it 's fine , go right ahead , " he said weakly .
She thanked him and began her cleaning .
The young developer got back to work and was pretty sure he was close to the bug when he heard a startling * crack * .
" Sorry , " the cleaning lady said , picking up the hand broom she 'd dropped .
The developer 's attention turned to her while she swept up some dirt into a small pile .
Nonchalantly , she reached into the punch card bin and swept the dirt onto one of the cards , picked it up and carried it to the trash , and threw away the card with the dirt .
The developer may have wept then .

( Natural News ) The Toyota Corporation intends to develop a plug - in hybrid vehicle for its demonstration fleet by 2010 , according to an announcement made by Chief Executive Officer Katsuaki Watanabe .
The planned plug - in hybrids are already under development , with two prototypes currently undergoing demonstration tests by researchers at the University of California .
But while existing prototypes operate with nickel - metal - hydride battery packs , Toyota aims for its new hybrids to be equipped with lithium - ion batteries .
Lithium-ion batteries , already widely used in consumer electronics , provide more energy per unit weight than older nickel - metal - hydride batteries , and can store a charge for longer when not in use .
Watanabe cautioned that while successful lithium - ion batteries have already been developed for hybrid electric automobiles , it is premature to assume that such batteries can be mass produced with existing techniques " As of today in the lab , the small volume of lithium - ion we have already developed is closer to the level we are satisfied with , but that is only in small quality , " he said .
" There is a huge difference between small volume and mass production of lithium - ion .
" The remarks were interpreted as a response to General Motors ' ( GM ) alliance with battery maker A123 , which has so far failed to deliver mass production of lithium - ion batteries .
Toyota 's other planned efforts in the area of fuel efficiency include the unveiling of new hybrid- only models in 2009 , increased investment in the production of ethanol from wood waste , the expansion of a joint Panasonic - Toyota batter factory , the introduction of " clean diesel " V - 8 versions of the Tundra pickup and Sequoia SUV and the sale of 1 million hybrid vehicles by 2012 .
In addition , Watanabe announced the company 's intention to meet California 's 35 mile per gallon fleet standard " well in advance " of the 2020 deadline .
Unlike competitor GM , Toyota is conducting all of its research in - house , rather than in partnership with small or start - up companies .
According to Watanabe , this will make technological development " faster and more efficient . "
Activists have outed a corporate dirty tricks operation tied to Burger King aimed at discrediting efforts to improve the often horrific conditions of migrant workers in Florida 's tomato fields .
It emerged yesterday that a top Burger King official is being investigated for using his young daughter 's online alias to make derogatory comments about the farm worker group , the Coalition of Immokalee Workers , which is asking the fast food chain to raise tomato pickers ' pay by a cent for every pound picked .
Burger King 's vice president Steven Grover was fingered as the source of venomous online attacks on student activists .
" Senior management of the company had no knowledge of Grover 's postings , " Burger King spokeswoman Denise Wilson said .
" We are conducting an internal investigation , and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken . "

The farm workers coalition discovered that abusive emails and comments under the names " activist2008 " actually originated at the Miami headquarters of Burger King .
The e-mail Internet protocol addresses are the same as Burger King's .
Emails claiming that activists were trying to get money for themselves were separately linked to a private email being used by Stephen Grover , Burger King ’s vice president .
Some of those posts were traced to the online name used by Mr Grover ’s daughter , who is still in school .
She confirmed that her father had used her online name " surfxaholic36 " to attack the activists who are trying to raise the pay of tomato pickers .
" That was my Dad .
That was him , " she said , when asked if she had written anything about the tomato workers online .
Mr Grover has not commented on the episode , but Burger King said " comments attributed to Steve Grover do not reflect Burger King ’s desire to find a way to assure decent wages and modern working conditions for the tomato harvesters . "
Separately a security firm offering " covert surveillance " and " undercover operations " has been discovered trying to infiltrate a student organisation which is agitating on campuses for better conditions for the migrant workers .
The attempted infiltration of the activists by paid corporate spies was noticed when Cara Shaffer , who described herself as a college student said she wanted to start an activist group at a Virginia university .
The activists quickly discovered that she actually heads a company named Diplomatic Tactical Services .
She now refuses to discuss her attempted involvement with the farmworker group .
A Burger King spokesperson said he " knows nothing about any Burger King effort to spy " on the student group .
Asked whether Burger King hired Diplomatic Tactical Services , she said : " We have no further comment . "

The developments come in the wake of US Senate held hearings into what some describe as modern - day slavery conditions of tomato pickers who work long hours in backbreaking conditions .
The rate of pay of many pickers , 45 cents a bucket , has not changed since 1978 .
The Senate hearings occurred after international media attention was drawn to a case in which three migrant workers were revealed to have been beaten and chained - up in a van overnight before being taken to the fields .
" Today 's form of slavery does not bear the overt nature of pre-Civil War society , but it is none the less heinous and reprehensible , " Detective Charlie Frost told the Washington hearing which took place last month .
Lucas Benitez , an activist for the Coalition of Immokalee Workers , told the Senate panel that tomato pickers are regularly abused , harassed , intimidated .
Many are kept so deeply in debt that it amounts to bondage .
Female pickers are also subjected to sexual harassment and abuse , he said .
In the past decade seven cases of modern - day slavery have been uncovered in the tomato fields of Florida .
But he described them as being the " tip of the iceberg . "
Detective Frost said the conditions of some workers in Florida were equivalent as human trafficking .
The large tomato producers shield themselves from prosecution by hiring subcontractors , who are responsible for human trafficking , he testified
The tomato growers reject the allegations of mistreatment and low pay .
" Florida 's tomato growers abhor and condemn slavery , " said Reginald Brown of the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange .
" We are paying fair wages and we 're paying our workers fairly , " he said .
But Senator Dick Durbin said workers would have to pick almost 3,000 tomatoes to earn $ 14 ( £7 ) and would have to fill and empty their buckets every two minutes .
A controversial law in Sweden which would have allowed Sweden 's National Defence Radio Establishment ( FRA ) to monitor all outgoing and incoming communications crossing Sweden 's borders did n't get enough votes in parliament today .
FRA would have been allowed to read emails and SMS messages and tap phone conversations without a court order .
A majority of Sweden 's center - right government agreed on Tuesday evening to support a revised version of the proposal , but Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt did n't get the backing of his four - party coalition and the draft has been sent back to the committee for revision .
Government representatives have pledged to build in more protection for personal privacy .
Sweden 's government believed the law was necessary because of the changing nature of security threats , terrorism and international crime , but many disagreed .
This morning journalists and bloggers assembled outside the Riksdag in Stockholm to express their anger at the Orwellian law .
Pär Ström of the independent New Welfare Foundation said Sweden would turn into a Swechelon , after the global spying network Echelon that can eavesdrop on every single phone call , fax or e-mail , anywhere on the planet .
Others believe the law would have created a country of self - censorship . ®
You can look at almost anything on Google .
Just do n't try to sneak a peek of the homes in the private community of North Oaks .
The city of 4,500 residents has demanded that Google Maps remove images of North Oaks homes from the website 's Street View feature , where any Internet user can glimpse a home from the nearest road .
North Oaks ' unique situation , in which the roads are privately owned by the residents and the city enforces a trespassing ordinance , may have made it the first city in the country to request that the online search engine remove images from Google Maps .
" It 's not the hoity - toity folks trying to figure out how to keep the world away , " said Mayor Thomas Watson .
" They really did n't have any authorization to go on private property . "
Since the introduction of Google Maps ' Street View last spring , the feature has caused controversy in several cities and with the federal government .
The Pentagon banned Google Maps from taking any images of military facilities , and a Pittsburgh couple sued the company over images of their home taken from the private road in front of their house .
The North Oaks City Council sent a letter to Google in January asking the company to remove the images and destroy the files or possibly be cited for violating the city 's trespassing ordinance .
Google spokeswoman Elaine Filadelfo said the images of North Oaks were removed shortly afterward .
She did n't know of any other city in the country that has made a similar request .
" This is very rare where an entire town would request to be taken off , " Filadelfo said .
The company receives a limited number of requests from individuals who do n't want their homes displayed on the website .
All of these images are removed from public view and would never be sold , Filadelfo said .
Violation of city law
North
Oaks officials stressed that they needed to enforce the city 's law against trespassing , whether it be a motorist who is n't aware of the rules or the Internet search engine behemoth .
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Spacewalking astronauts from U.S. shuttle Discovery finished outfitting Japan ’s newly arrived Kibo research laboratory and carried out other tasks during 6 1/2 hours of work outside the International Space Station on Sunday .
Astronauts Michael Fossum and Ronald Garan also did preventive maintenance on the station ’s air conditioner , which NASA wants in the best shape possible before the shuttle fleet ’s retirement in 2010 .
Sunday ’s work was the latest in an ambitious schedule to complete construction of the $ 100 billion station over the next two years .
Nine more shuttle flights to the station are planned by the U.S. space agency , along with a single flight to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope .
Soaring 210 miles over Earth , Fossum and Garan floated back inside and closed the station ’s airlock by 4:28 p.m. EDT ( 2028 GMT ) .
Their main job was to replace a 550 - pound ( 249 - kg ) tank of nitrogen used to pressurize the outpost ’s ammonia cooling system .
Riding on the station ’s 58 - foot ( 18 - metre ) Canadian - built robot arm , Garan removed the old tank and picked up the new tank from a storage platform on the other side of the outpost .
“ Enjoy the ride , ” said Karen Nyberg , who operated the crane from inside the station ’s Destiny laboratory .
She maneuvered the robot arm after remarking earlier Garan would be riding “ on top of the world . ”
Slideshow ( 18 images )
Nyberg and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide , who also operated the robot arm , reversed the maneuver so Garan could install the new tank .
Fossum , meanwhile , took another look inside one of the huge paddle - wheel joints that pivot the station ’s solar wing panels so they constantly face the sun to provide electrical power .
One joint has been contaminated with metal shavings and engineers are determining how best to clean it up and prevent more damage .
The other side has been working well , but a quick inspection by Fossum during a spacewalk on Thursday revealed what appeared to be a thin coating of debris on the metal ring , which engineers would like to analyze .
The spacewalkers also reinstalled a television camera that was outfitted with a new power supply , removed a window cover from the Kibo laboratory and removed locks that secured Kibo ’s 33 - foot - ( 10 - metre - ) long robot arm during launch on May 31 .
Discovery , which arrived at the orbital outpost on June 2 , is scheduled to depart on its trip home on Wednesday .

While we spend a lot of time talking about traditional energy sources based on depleting resources that are extracted from the ground , I think its important to remember that the fastest growing sources of energy are solar and wind , and that these will never run out .
As M King Hubbert put it regarding solar power in particular :
The biggest source of energy on this earth , now or ever , is solar .
I used to think it was so diffuse as to be impractical .
But I ’ve changed my mind .
It ’s not impractical … This technology exists right now .
So if we just convert the technology and research and facilities of the oil and gas industries , the chemical industry and the electrical power industry — we could do it tomorrow .
All we ’ve got to do is throw our weight into it .
What distinguishes Ausra 's design is its relative simplicity .
In conventional solar - thermal plants such as Solel 's , a long trough of parabolic mirrors focuses sunlight on a tube filled with a heat - transfer fluid , often some sort of oil or brine .
The fluid , in turn , produces steam to drive a turbine and produce electricity .
Ausra 's solar collectors employ mass - produced and thus cheaper flat mirrors , and they focus light onto tubes filled with water , thus directly producing steam .
Ausra 's collectors produce less power , but that power costs less to produce .
Both Stuart Staniford 's recent " Powering Civilization to 2050 " post and ( to a lesser extent ) Scientific American's " Solar Grand Plan " concentrated on using photovoltaic solar cells to provide the bulk of our energy needs .
While both thin film and traditional silicon based PV cells seem to set new efficiency records every couple of months ( a CIGS cell recently reached 19.9 % efficiency in lab tests , and multi-crystalline silicon PV cells recently reached 19.5 % efficiency ) , the most promising mechanism for large scale solar power generation seems to be solar thermal power ( often referred to as concentrating solar power , or CSP ) .
While this subject has been covered previously at TOD ( from a slightly UK - centric viewpoint ) , I thought it was worth revisiting as solar thermal power has received a lot of press attention lately , as experience with generating power in this way grows and the potential becomes clearer to a larger number of parties .
Concentrated sunlight has been used to perform useful tasks for many centuries .
A legend claims Archimedes used polished shields to concentrate sunlight on a Roman fleet to repel them from Syracuse in 212 BC .
Leonardo Da Vinci considered using large scale solar concentrators to weld copper in the 15th century .
Auguste Mouchout successfully powered a steam engine with sunlight in 1866 - the first known example of a concentrating solar - powered mechanical device .
Concentrating Solar Power ( CSP ) systems use lenses or mirrors combined with tracking systems to focus sunlight which is then used to generate electricity .
The primary mechanisms for concentrating sunlight are the parabolic trough , the solar power tower ( not to be confused with solar updraft towers ) and the parabolic dish .
The high temperatures produced by CSP systems can also be used to provide heat and steam for a variety of applications ( cogeneration ) .
CSP technologies require direct sunlight ( insolation ) to function and are of limited use in locations with significant cloud cover .
Solar thermal power plants have been in commercial use in southern California since 1985 .
An area of desert around 250 km by 250 km covered with CSP power generation could supply all the world 's current electricity demand .
Solar thermal plants can be built in their entirety within a few years - much faster than many conventional power projects .
Solar thermal plants are built almost entirely with modular , commodity materials ( and thus have short development and construction times ) and do not encounter the sort of opposition on environmental grounds that traditional forms of power generation like coal and nuclear face .
Operational plants include :* US ( California ) - 354 MW FPL 's Solar Energy Generating Systems ( SEGS ) plant , using parabolic troughs *
US ( Arizona ) - 1 MW Acciona Energy 's Saguaro Solar Generating Station using parabolic troughs * Spain ( Seville ) - 11 MW
Abengoa 's PS10 solar tower * Australia ( NSW ) - 35 MW Liddell Power Station using fresnel reflectors * US ( Nevada ) - 64 MW Acciona Energy 's Nevada Solar
One plant ( not to be confused with the Solar One / Solar Two experimental plants ) using parabolic troughs Plants currently under construction :* Spain ( Seville ) - 20 MW
Abengoa 's PS20 solar tower * Spain ( Seville ) - 20 MW ( each ) Abengoa 's PS20 and AZ20 solar towers * Spain ( Seville ) - 50 MW ( each ) Abengoa 's Solnova 1 and 3 using parabolic troughs ( 5 plants planned in all ) *
Spain ( Andalusia ) - 17 MW
Sener 's Solar
Tres solar tower ( molten salt energy storage ) * Spain ( Andalusia ) - 50 MW ( each ) Sener 's Andasol I , II and III plants ( molten salt energy storage ) There has been a spate of new announcements regarding solar thermal power over the past year - there are over 5,800 MW of solar thermal plants in the planning stages worldwide .
The company receiving the most attention seems to be Ausra , a company set up by Dr David Mills ( who pioneered the CSP plant at the Liddell power plant in New South Wales using compact linear Fresnel - reflector technology ) with backing from Vinod Khosla and Kleiner , Perkins , Caulfield & Byers ( see here for a brief demo of how their technology works ) .
Mills estimates that solar thermal plants could provide more than 90 percent of current U.S. power demand at prices competitive with coal and natural gas .
" There 's almost no limit to how much you can put into the grid , " he says .
Mills presented a paper ( pdf ) at the IEA SolarPACES conference in Las Vegas recently which revealed some interesting statistics about the construction cost of solar - thermal technologies : US $ 3,000 per kW of capacity , estimating this will drop to US $ 1,500 per kW over the next " several " years .
The New York Times last year quoted GE Energy executives estimating coal plant construction between US $ 2,000 and US $ 3,000 per kW .
Ausra says it can generate electricity for 10 cents per kWh ( close to the current cost using natural gas ) , and it expects the price to drop even further .
According to Technology Review Ausra is initially planning a 177 MW plant in California , and has committed to supply 1,500 MW of power to Californian utilities PG&E and FPL .
They are also rumoured to be moving in to Texas as well .
PG&E have also signed a 25 - year deal with Ausra competitor Solel Solar Systems of Israel to buy power from a 553 MW solar thermal plant that Solel is developing in California 's Mojave Desert .
FPL has also hired Solel to upgrade the SEGS solar - thermal plants it operates in the Mojave .
Another PG&E contract is with BrightSource to supply between 500 MW and 900 MW of power per year from solar tower plants in California , beginning in 2011 , with the first of a number of 100 MW facilities being built in Ivanpah .
Other companies active in the US include eSolar ( linked to Google 's energy initiatives ) , RocketDyne and SkyFuel Abu Dhabi's Masdar Initiative and Spain 's Sener are have formed a joint venture to build and operate concentrating solar power plants across the world 's sunbelt regions called Torresol Energy .
Independently of Torresol , Masdar is developing its 100 MW Shams 1 " CSP plant in Abu Dhabi .
Algeria and Germany have signed a a joint research agreement for the development of a new generation of large - scale , low - cost solar thermal power plants ( which could contribute to the Desert - TREC vision of large scale CSP in North Africa powering Europe ) .
More new plants are being planned in :* Algeria - 20 MW
Abengoa 's plant in Hassi- R'Mel * Australia - 10 MW Queensland State Government facility in Cloncurry * Australia - 154 MW
Solar Systems and TRUEnergy 's plant in Mildura * Egypt - 70 MW plant in Kuraymat * Iran - 17 MW plant in Yazd * Israel - 250 MW plant in Ashalim * Morocco - 20 MW
Abengoa 's plant in Ain-Ben- Mathar * US ( Arizona ) - 280 MW Abengoa and Arizona Public Service 's plant in Gila Bend * US ( California ) - 50 MW Inland Energy 's plant in Victorville * US ( California ) - 250 MW FPL Energy 's Beacon Solar Energy Project Feasibility studies are also being done in Oman China and Mexico
One of the key differentiating factors between solar thermal power and solar PV is that heat energy is more easily ( and efficiently ) stored than electricity , with solar thermal plants often combining energy storage into the design to enable around - the - clock , dispatchable electricity generation .
Most solar thermal plants are looking to use molten salt for storing energy - other alternatives being developed are graphite ( in the Cloncurry development ) , heated water / steam ( for the Ausra plants ) and heat - transfer oil such as therminol ( for the Abengoa plant in Arizona ) .
The existing plants prove that concentrated solar power is practical , but costs must decrease .
Electricity from solar thermal plants currently costs between US$ 0.13 per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) and US$ 0.17 per kWh , depending on the location of the plant and the amount of sunshine it receives .
Conventional power plants generate electricity for between US$ 0.05 and US$ 0.15 per kilowatt hour ( not including any carbon taxes or cap and trade related costs ) but in most places it 's below US $ 0.10 ( wind power generally costs around US $ 0.08 per kWh ) .
An economic analysis released last month by Severin Borenstein ( pdf ) , director of the University of California 's Energy Institute , notes that solar thermal power will become cost competitive with other forms of power generation decades before photovoltaics will , even if greenhouse - gas emissions are not taxed aggressively .
In 2006 a report by the Solar Task Force ( pdf ) of the Western Governors ’ Association concluded that CSP could provide electricity at US$ 0.10 per kWh or less by 2015 if 4 GW of plants were constructed .
According to Bernhard Milow from the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) electricity from solar thermal plants could cost as little as € 0.04 per kWh [ US $ 0.06 / kWh ] by 2020 , with well sited plants potentially generating power at lower prices than coal .
The US DOE began supporting large scale CSP last year , aiming to reduce the cost of CSP power to 7-10 ¢ / kWh by 2015 and 5 - 7¢ / kWh by 2020 .
The DOE estimated that reaching these cost targets could lead to installation of up to 35,000 MW of new generating capacity by 2030 in the US .
James Fraser at The Energy Blog commented at the time that it was 5 years too late ( given recent commercial activity in the area ) and that PV solar may beat these price goals before solar thermal does , but that more solar options are good in any case , as both PV and thin film solar manufacturing will be constrained by availability for materials for some time as production continues to accelerate .
Another estimate from Sandia labs showed solar thermal costs ( for solar towers ) could fall to around 4 cents per kWh by 2030 .
Another variant on the solar thermal power theme are Stirling engine based power plants , which generate electricity directly rather than first storing the energy as heat .
Stirling Energy Systems seems to be the leader in this field , with some reports talking about agreements with Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric for up to 1.75 GW of power .
The company recently set a new world record of 31.25 % for Solar - to - Grid conversion efficiency
Other companies pursuing stirling engine based solutions are Infinia and SunPower ( not to be confused with its larger namesake in the PV industry ) .
Generating power is n't the only way to utilise solar thermal energy of course - solar hot water is a very cheap and efficient way of replacing gas or electricity usage with solar energy .
Solar hot water systems are in widespread use in Australia , with state and federal governments encouraging people to upgrade their home hot water systems to solar - almost cost free in some states .
The New Zealand government is also encouraging the use of solar hot water systems .
Some larger scale uses of solar thermal hot water are being put in place by Abengoa in Texas and Colorado Solar hot water is in wide use in China as well , with the city of Rizhao becoming somewhat famous for achieving widespread takeup of the units .
An unusual variation of the direct capture of solar energy in the form of heat is from a Dutch company that has developed a " Road Energy System " that siphons heat from roads and parking lots to heat offices and homes .
And one final use of solar thermal power - it can keep your house warm , if your windows face the right way , and even better , have insulating glass that does n't let the heat out again - which could help make your building energy positive
Cold - blooded organisms find it harder to cope with temperature change Many tropical insects face extinction by the end of this century unless they adapt to the rising global temperatures predicted , US scientists have said .
Researchers led by the University of Washington said insects in the tropics were much more sensitive to temperature changes than those elsewhere .
In contrast , higher latitudes could experience an insect population boom .
The scientists said changes in insect numbers could have secondary effects on plant pollination and food supplies .
In the research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the US scientists studied how temperature changes between 1950 and 2000 had affected 38 species of insects .
In the tropics , many species appear to be living at or near their thermal optimum , a temperature that lets them thrive
Joshua Tewksbury
University of Washington Unlike warm - blooded animals , cold - blooded organisms cannot regulate their body temperatures by growing a coat of fur or shedding it when it gets warm .
They are instead limited to either seek shade when hot or sun themselves when cool .
The scientists predicted such species would struggle to cope with the 2 - 4 degrees Celsius rise in tropical temperatures predicted for the late 21st Century .
" In the tropics , many species appear to be living at or near their thermal optimum , a temperature that lets them thrive , " said Joshua Tewksbury of the University of Washington .
" But once temperature gets above the thermal optimum , fitness levels most likely decline quickly and there may not be much they can do about it , " he added .
Although some species might be able to migrate uphill and towards higher latitudes , or evolve to cope with the warmer climate , others might eventually die out , the scientists said .

" Over the years our company has dealt with several known hosting companies that promised everything but delivered very little .
Needless to say we had plenty of bad experiences .
As an online store we rely on fast servers , security from hacking , consistent up - time and should problems arise , a fast , responsive and knowledgeable customer service .
Our website has been hacked before with a previous well known hosting company .
Our website was scrambled and defaced by the attack .
Instead of helping us to restore the website , they were trying to up - sell me to expensive security and backup services .
After we did n't buy into that , they refused to help or correct the problem .
My website was down for a week and we looked at potentially paying hundreds of dollars to repair the site .
A friend recommended AISO Hosting to me .
The moment I called them , I felt that I am at the right place .
Immediately my AISO customer service guy Julio gained access to our previous Gator Hosting account , repaired the damage the hacker has done and transferred the clean website to an AISO server .
Free of charge .
AISO offered us all security services including backups free of charge .
No up - selling ever .
The customer service ( in my case Julio ) is top notch and fast in solving any issue or answering any of my questions .
I am so happy that I am with an awesome hosting company .
I feel good , because I know that any problem that arises will be taken care of .
I have recommended several other website owners to AISO and so far all of them are happy they made the switch .
As long as I am operating websites , I will be with AISO .
Hands down the BEST . "

The news was depressing , to say the least .
Two weeks ago , a poll conducted for the Observer found that a majority of the British public still think that the scientists are arguing about the causes of climate change .
The reality , as I and many others have repeated more or less ad nauseum , is that the debate was settled a long time ago , and that the major areas of scientific uncertainty are about how far and how fast , not whether climate change is happening at all .
I blame the media almost entirely for this discrepancy between public understanding and scientific reality .
The Daily Telegraph , for instance , still pumps out climate - denialist articles on a regular basis , and carries frequent antideluvian commentary on the subject from the likes of Christopher Brooker ( whose latest piece excoriates " fanatical upholders of the [ climate change ] dogma " ) .
The Mail does likewise , though Melanie Phillips has been curiously silent on the subject for several months .
Like the tobacco lobbyists who spent years denying the links between smoking and cancer , global warming denialists do n't have to win the debate – they simply have to confuse the public indefinitely to successfully undermine any political action which might hit the interests of their backers in the fossil fuel industries .
The arguments change all the time : this year it is " global warming has stopped " , while last year it was " hurricanes are n't linked with warming " , and the year before " satellites do n't show any warming of the atmosphere " .
As each argument is laboriously refuted by scientists , the deniers simply drop it and skip onto the next one .
The second headline finding from the Observer poll further underlines this confusion .
An equal number of people ( about 40 % in each case ) think that " climate change might not be as bad as some people say " .
Again , the frequent cries from the anti-environment right about global warming " alarmism " have clearly hit home .
There is further bad news on the environment versus economy debate .
While concern about the economy is seeing its highest score since 1993 , concern about the environment is flatlining in the June 23 Mori poll , and is well down from the higher levels seen during the launch of the Stern and IPCC reports in early 2007 .
But with polls , detail is everything .
Today 's new poll result shows that a clear majority favours government action on the environment v the economy , while an even larger majority supports the introduction of green taxes .
So why the contradiction ?
The discrepancy may lie with different techniques used by different pollsters – the Observer poll was carried out by Ipsos Mori , while the latest Guardian survey was conducted by ICM .
It may also lie with the exact wording of the question , which in the latter case probably leaves more room for individual interpretation .
Also , people know that they are " supposed " to be concerned about the environment , so may prioritise it when questioned by a pollster , but fail to volunteer it in their own list of suggested priorities .
The ICM poll does throw up some other interesting results .
When asked whether they thought their friends would now by cheaper groceries – rather than more expensive environmentally friendly alternatives – given the recent rises in the cost of living , a majority of nearly 60 % went for the cheaper option .
This suggests that in buying patterns at least , the economic downturn is indeed having a clear impact on ethical choices .
But perhaps the most fascinating result of all emerges from the small print of the different social classes of the ICM survey respondents .
Environmentalists are constantly accused of being middle - class lifestyle faddists , who do n't understand the day - to - day financial pressures faced by " ordinary " working people .
But the number of people who thought that environment should be the government 's priority rather than the economy was substantially higher ( 56 % ) among the lower income , less well - educated DE demographic than among the better - off ABs ( 47 % ) .
Lower - income social groups also have a much lighter environmental footprint overall : only 42 % of DEs took a foreign holiday over the last three years , whilst 77 % of ABs did .
Better - off people also own more cars , as you might expect – only 5 % of DEs have three or more cars , whilst 15 % of ABs do .
So perhaps anti-environmental class warriors like the editors of Spiked need to find a new cause to champion .
The working - class people who they claim " ca n't afford to be concerned about climate change " actually care more about the future of the planet than the rich – and are doing a lot less damage to boot .
So next time you hear someone defending motorway expansion or cheap flights on behalf of the British poor , ask yourself the question : whose side are they really on ?
Fluid Test # 3 : 3D Flow Inside a Computer USING FLOTRAN
Introduction :
In this example you will model the flow of air inside a computer case due to its cooling fans .
Physical Problem : Compute and plot the velocity distribution in the case shown in the figure .
Problem Description : Objective :
To plot the velocity profile within the case .
You are required to hand in print outs for the above .
Figure : Important Dimensions : ( all dimensions are in meters ) Height = 0.414 m Width = 0.1905 m Depth = 0.4064 m Inlet Fan Position :
The X and Y position of the corner of the block ( to create the fan ) is ( 0.07,0.04 ) .
Width = 0.1 m Height = 0.1 m The air entering the computer is traveling 0.1m / s. Outlet Position : ( From a plane parallel to the inlet fan at the corner farthest from the origin )
The X and Y position of the corner of the block ( to create the outlet ) is ( - 0.17 , -0.14 ) .
Width = 0.1 m Height = 0.1 m ·
To best model this system , model the volume defining the case first .
·
Then , delete only the volume ( leaving the areas , lines , and keypoints ) and create the areas defining the inlet and the outlet of the air flow .
· Overlap the areas to their respective faces of the computer case .
( front and back ) ·
Once the areas have been overlapped , they should then be married back into an “ arbitrary ” volume .
( defined “ by areas ” ) ·
At this point , define the Element Properties as a 3D Air Element · Define the Material Properties of the Air Element ( Density and Viscosity are the important qualities )
Mesh the volume with a mesh size of 0.02 on all lines .
Apply Boundary Conditions
( No Slip along the areas of the case that do not function as an inlet or outlet , velocity into the inlet area , and Atmospheric Pressure ( P=0 in ANSYS ) on the outlet area ) Iterate 25 times and solve .
( Ideally the iteration count would be at least several thousand times to make sure that the solution converges … but computational time dictates that in order to be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time , the iteration number should be trimmed down to 25 ) Plot the Velocity distribution in the X and Y directions .
At this point only the outermost region of the case will be evident , so make the workplane the “ cutting plane ” and show the velocity distribution along the Z axis in the middle of the case )
Plot this with both a Contour Plot and a Vector Plot .
This is the answer you should obtain with 25 iterations : ( Contour Plot ) ( Vector Plot )
Mr Maliki ( R ) is also looking for Iran 's economic help Iraq will not allow its territory to be used to attack Iran , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has said during a visit to Tehran .
Mr Maliki met the foreign minister and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who pledged to help with Iraq 's security .
The role of the US in Iraq is high on the agenda , with Tehran concerned about a treaty under discussion on the terms of the US military 's future in Iraq .
Iran 's alleged backing for militants in Iraq was also expected to be discussed .
' Peace and security ' " We will not allow Iraq to become a platform for harming the security of Iran and neighbours , " Iranian state - run media quoted Mr Maliki as saying after late - night talks with Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki .
In his talks with Mr Ahmadinejad , Iranian media quoted Mr Maliki as saying : " A stable Iraq will be a benefit to the security of the region and the world . "
The future role of US troops is a key concern for Iran Mr Ahmadinejad told Mr Maliki : " Iraq 's neighbours have more responsibility to help the country to establish peace and security . "
Without referring directly to the US - Iraqi deal , Mr Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying : " Iraq must reach a certain level of stability so that its enemies are not able to impose their influence . "
A statement from Mr Maliki 's office in Baghdad said economic and trade issues were high on the agenda .
" Iraq is looking forward to Iranian companies taking part in developing its infrastructure , " Mr Maliki is quoted as saying .
The BBC's John Leyne , in Tehran , says Iran has made no secret of its opposition to the current negotiations going on between Iraq and the US , which are aimed at regulating the presence of US forces in the country after their UN mandate expires at the end of 2008 .
The US - Iraqi talks , which are seeking to reach agreement by the end of July , have run into problems over issues related to Iraqi sovereignty .
The Iraqi prime minister was also expected to raise allegations of Iranian support for Shia militants in Iraq .
Shia militiamen fought bitter battles with US and Iraqi government forces between March and May .
Mr Maliki is on his third visit to Iran since taking office in June 2005 .
Government sources say Iraqi security officials with the delegation will be showing the Iranians evidence of their alleged support for the militias , the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad reports .
Iran has always denied any involvement , but officials say Mr Maliki will once again urge Tehran to support the Baghdad government and stop secretly backing militias .

The link between attractiveness and facial symmetry seems to hold across both black and white faces , but also in non-human primates , according to a study just published in the open- access science journal PLoS One .
One of the most striking studies in sex and symmetry research is n’t mentioned , however .
A 1995 study found that the likelihood of female orgasm during sex was related to the extent of bodily symmetry in the male partner .
The study was led by biologist Randy Thornhill and recruited 86 young couples who completed a number of relationship questionnaires , including one on how often the female partner orgasmed during sex .
The males then had their bodies measured and assessed for how much one side differed compared to the other – a measure of bodily asymmetry .
In the final analysis neither the male ’s age , wealth , social skills , physical attractiveness or relationship style predicted the frequency of female orgasm .
Only male bodily symmetry was statistically associated with the chance of the women climaxing during sex .
The researchers thought that maybe women who have more orgasms , or who are just more sexual , simply get the more symmetrical ( maybe hotter ) guys .
But when they looked at frequency of orgasm outside copulation ( such as during oral sex or masturbation ) , the relationship to male symmetry disappeared , suggesting that this was n’t the case .
This study , and the new study published in PLoS One , also suggested that symmetry was associated with more masculine features generally – a bigger body in the orgasm study , and a more typically male face in the PLoS research .
The evolutionary explanation suggested by the authors is that female orgasm during copulation may make pregnancy more likely , so it ’s an adaptive strategy to increase fertility when making love to males with genes more likely to lead to healthy children .
How orgasm increases with body symmetry is not clearly understood , though .
The authors speculate that female perception of a highly symmetrical male might psychologically prime sexual arousal , but the mechanism is left largely to guesswork .

If you believe in evolution , you know there was n’t some superstar golfer caveman from which Tiger Woods evolved centuries later .
His talent and subsequent success were not a genetic lottery win — let ’s take a look at 12 factors that we can adapt from this legendary golfer .
Even if Tiger Woods was somehow physically superior , all that gossip could be laid to rest , when Tiger Woods won this years U.S. Open playing with a bum knee .
Ok , so maybe a knee is n’t that crucial to a golfer , but walking on it while experiencing a great deal of pain and keeping the focus does prove that there ’s more to this man than his stroke .
12 Rules for Success From Tiger Woods
1. Constant and Never Ending Improvement
“ No matter how good you get you can always get better and that ’s the exciting part ” ~ Tiger Woods
Never settle for good enough , not when you know you could always be better tomorrow than you were today .
That ’s how Tiger keeps himself excited , into the game , and appreciating his life on a daily basis .
Each day he practices his technique and improves a little bit .
You can be sure he takes this principle out of the game and into life .
2. A Bigger Plan
“ I think it ’s an honor to be a role model to one person or maybe more than that .
If you are given a chance to be a role model , I think you should always take it because you can influence a person ’s life in a positive light , and that ’s what I want to do .
That ’s what it ’s all about . ” ~Tiger Woods
Tiger looks at the big picture , which is usually bigger than his own success and accomplishments .
One thing he does is mentor individuals , both in Golf and in life .
The kind of impact he has on these people will extend past his network , past what he could do himself , and he knows this .
3. Embrace Defeat
“ I ’m trying as hard as I can , and sometimes things do n’t go your way , and that ’s the way things go . ” ~Tiger Woods
Defeat will come from time to time but it ’s much better to accept it and move on instead of sticking your claws into it and not letting go .
This includes wallowing in your own misery , feeling sorry for yourself , and gossiping about your opponent .
The quicker that you can pick yourself up and start training for the next challenge the more prepared and successful you will be .
4. Take Life Lightly
“ If you ca n’t laugh at yourself , then who can you laugh at ? ” ~Tiger Woods
Not every moment has to be spent with a serious face on your mug .
It ’s perfectly okay to laugh , even in the face of tragedy .
Realistically speaking we do n’t ever know if we ’ll be here tomorrow , so we might as well make the best of today .
Even if we were guaranteed tomorrow , it does n’t mean we should n’t extract every morsel of pleasure out of whatever we ’ve committed our life to at the moment .
5. Do n’t Stop
“ Tiger may have used his golf club as a cane , but he refused to use his injury as a crutch . ”
~ Brian Clark
Tiger faced serious post surgery trauma during his last game .
It hurt like hell .
Despite his injury Tiger did not complain .
He did not want to even consider using his injury as an excuse and instead focused all his energy on winning .
Less talking , no stopping , more winning .
6. Live Your Own Expectations
“ One of the things that my parents have taught me is never listen to other people ’s expectations .
You should live your own life and live up to your own expectations , and those are the only things I really care about it . ”
~ Tiger Woods
The moment we start allowing ourselves to live the way other people want us to live we become average .
We become this culmination of wants , needs , expectations — and none of them belong to us .
Not Tiger .
Tiger lives his life by his self - made rules .
Be the best he told himself , and then he defined what the best was .
7. Do What You Love
“ I get to play golf for a living .
What more can you ask for – getting paid for doing what you love . ” ~ Tiger Woods
When you ’re doing what you love it does n’t even matter if you ’re getting paid .
When you think about it , you spend more time working than you do with your family or your place of worship .
You might as well take pleasure in the time you spend ‘ on the clock ’ or in Tiger ’s case on the field .
8. Focus
“ My main focus is on my game . ” ~Tiger Woods
Having one solid goal which you can devote all your focus into pools together all your available resources .
You begin to enroll other people into your vision and they start to believe in you .
This will give you access to new tools , mentors , and even more resources to get to your goal faster and better .
9. Pay It Forward
“ My dad has always taught me these words : care and share .
That ’s why we put on clinics .
The only thing I can do is try to give back .
If it works , it works . ” ~ Tiger Woods
You do n’t know how much money you have until you give it away .
I ’m sure you ’ve heard that before many times .
The same thing goes for our talents , skills , and other opportunities .
When we can empower people by giving a piece of ourselves to them we can leave a legacy or live on through them .
Besides we ’re programmed to feel good when we are kind to others .
10 . Learn From All Mistakes
“ The only thing you can do is take a learning experience from it , positives and negatives , and apply them to the future .
What did you do right , what did you do wrong , and I did a lot of things right this week ” ~ Tiger Woods
You can subscribe to the idea that everything is put into our life as a challenge .
When things are going bad it is our challenge to over come them .
When things are going great it is our challenge to remain grounded and humble .
It ’s all there so that we can learn from it and grow , so there ’s no point getting hung up on or experiencing a huge grief over a bad mistake .
Be happy that you learned a valuable lesson .
11 . Celebrate Your Victories
“ It ’s been a lot of fun to see some fruits of my hard labor . ” ~Tiger Woods
No matter how many times
Tiger wins he treats each win as if it is special .
This provides a constant positive reinforcement to keep him interested in giving the game his best .
Perhaps if he only celebrated once a year , after the final stats were in and he saw he was still the best , he would n’t be living so much in the moment .
If Tiger was n’t living in the present , or at least one game at a time , there is no way he would be as happy as he could be .
12 . Pay No Attention To Naysayers
“ You know , all the nay - sayers said that I was doing the wrong things .
They can understand why now I made those changes . ” ~ Tiger Woods
Had Tiger payed attention to the first critic that told him he would n’t make it he would have given up when he started golfing at the age of 5 .
If he gave up the second time he would n’t be here either .
During Tigers career there have been thousands upon thousands of people commenting and gossiping that this game would n’t be his game , and even if it is he still wo n’t win it all .
Nonsense .
By going for his goals despite the nay - sayers Tiger made it all happen .
Practical Application .
By now I hope you realized that Tiger Woods is both an amazing athlete and an incredible person .
While you may not be a golfer , or if you are you may not be as good as Tiger , you can see how his wisdom could be applied to your every day life .
Be the Tiger Woods of whatever you are passionate about .
Do n’t stop , do n’t listen to anybody except your own expectations , and achieve your bigger plan .

There seems to be two discussions going on about Metal Gear Solid 4 .
One is about the game 's actual reviews , and the other is about actually reviewing the game .
Rumors swirled that reviewers were n't able to talk about MGS4 cutscenes and installs — rumors that were later confirmed in IGN UK's MGS4 review and by EGM 's decision not to review the game .
Konami and Kojima Productions were taken to task for this highly unusual NDA .
But what was in this NDA ?
Kojima Productions ' Assistant Producer Ryan Payton contacted Kotaku in hopes of setting the record straight and coming clean .
Advertisement
About those review limitations , Payton says the NDA covered : Install times , length of cutscenes ( the ending in particular ) , number of environments , opening " movie " , product placement and a half dozen story - specific items .
Payton gets down to specifics , stating , " The game requires an eight minute install , as well as a number of two to three - minute installs between acts . "
But what about the cutscenes ?
The rationale , according to Payton , was that they wanted reviewers to refrain from describing which cutscenes were long as it would " ruin " the experience if players knew when a cutscene was unfolding .
What 's more , Payton adds , " I want to make it clear that , from today , reviewers are welcome to discuss the length of the cutscenes and install times , but we ask that they not get too specific about the cinematic times and what happens in later install sequences ... "
Hit the jump for Payton 's email in full .
Hey Brian , Believe it or not , I 've been so busy working on a special surprise for MGS4 buyers ( that not even those who have leaked copies of the game can spoil !
Haha ! ) , that I have n't had time to catch up on most of the pre-launch excitement .
Scanning the net today , I came across that 90 - minute cutscene rumor , and a red - faced Adam Sessler , who was obviously very upset about the restrictions placed on MGS4 reviews .
Adam asks at the end of his Soapbox clip if he was rambling .
On the contrary , I think he voiced some really important concerns about the restrictions placed on MGS4 reviewers .
In light of this , I took a look at the list of restrictions and found that some items are outdated and require more explanation .
We asked reviewers to avoid the following topics : - Install times
- Length of cutscenes ( the ending in particular )
- Number of environments
- Opening " movie "
- Product placement
-( Plus a half dozen story - specific items )
The game requires an eight minute install , as well as a number of two to three - minute installs between acts .
As for the cutscenes , reviewers are more than happy to comment on whether they 're too long or short .
We simply want reviewers to refrain from describing which scenes are long , thus spoiling some of the experience because players will know what to expect when a scene is unfolding .
I want to make it clear that , from today , reviewers are welcome to discuss the length of the cutscenes and install times , but we ask that they not get too specific about the cinematic times and what happens in later install sequences ...
But as for the next three items , we are still asking reviewers to avoid these topics .
We want the opening to be a huge surprise for gamers , and knowing how many environments there are in the game , obviously , is a spoiler .
These restrictions will remain in place .
Finally , we 've asked reviewers to not write about some of the product placement because of some contractual agreements we have with third parties .
I hope this helps clear up some of the controversy .
As a former writer , I 'm proud of the discussion this topic has sparked .
I hope Adam , Patrick Klepek , and everybody else who covered this issue continue to be diligent about restrictions placed on media outlets .
( That 's honestly why I 'm such a fan of Kotaku — it keeps publishers on their toes . )
I do , however , hope gamers can appreciate the efforts we go through to keep them protected from reviewers that could spoil some of the MGS4 experience .
rp
Eds Note : Adam Sessler has responded , stating : " I 'm very pleased this has a resolution in time for the reviews on the game to come out .
I have n't talked to Ryan Payton yet , who I consider a friend and colleague , but I greatly appreciate his and Kojima production 's reconsideration of these restrictions .
Our ability to speak openly and honestly to our viewers has always been of the utmost importance , and I know Kojima productions and Konami feel the same way . "

McCain Dogged by Economy Comment McCain goes to Colombia and Mexico as voters fret over U.S. economy .
July 2 , 2008  -- Sen. John McCain 's comment from last year that he does n't understand economics " as well as he should " has dogged him all the way to South America today during a foreign trip meant to burnish his standing as a presidential candidate ready to be a world leader .
The Republican senator from Arizona smiled as he denied he ever dissed his understanding of economics and said he was " more experienced than my opponent . "
The Republican presidential candidate made his comments during an exclusive interview from Cartagena , Colombia , with " Good Morning America 's " Robin Roberts , who asked McCain why he went abroad when the No. 1 issue for voters was the U.S. economy .
" You have admitted that you 're not exactly an expert when it comes to the economy , " Roberts began .
" I have not .
I have not .
I actually have not , " McCain interrupted .
" I said that I am stronger on national security issues because of all the time I spent in the military .
Very strong on the economy .
I understand it .
I have a lot more experience than my opponent . "
The original remark that prompted Roberts ' question and has haunted McCain slipped out last December in New Hampshire when McCain said , " The issue of economics is not something I 've understood as well as I should . "
He went on to joke , " I have Greenspan 's book , " referring to the biography that has just been published at the time by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan .
And at a January town hall meeting in Concord , N.H. , McCain told the crowd , " I am not an expert on Wall Street .
I am not an expert on some of this stuff . "
McCain has tried previously to deny that he ever claimed ignorance of economic matters , but those quotes wo n't go away .
Polls give his Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , a 16 - point advantage over McCain on the issue of the economy , and Obama likes to claim that McCain 's economic plan is an extension of the Bush administration 's policies .
Obama is also taking advantage of a campaign lull during the summer holidays to travel abroad .
The Democratic contender 's polls are weakest on voters ' perception of him as an experienced leader , so Obama 's travels will take him to Iraq , Afghanistan and Europe .
' Not Ignoring Economy '
Matt Dowd , a former Republican political strategist and currently an ABC News political contributor , said McCain was taking a risk by visiting South America instead of staying home and talking about the economy .
" He risks not talking to voters on where they are and what they want to vote on , " Dowd told " GMA . "
" Taking a trip to Colombia , I think voters may see that as a distraction from what they really care about right now . "
McCain insisted on " GMA " that the economy is one of his top issues .
" I 'm not ignoring the economy , " he said .
" I 've been speaking about it over the last two weeks . "
McCain said a key to reviving the economy is ending the country 's dependence on foreign oil , and he ticked off elements of his energy plan , including more offshore oil drilling and nuclear power plants along with increased use of wind , solar and clean coal technology .
He would also end subsidies for ethanol and urged the use of sugar cane as an alternative source of fuel instead .
McCain 's trip to Colombia and then to Mexico will emphasize free trade , although nearly half of the voters see that as an economic threat to American jobs , and the dangers of the drug trade .
" Drugs is a big , big problem in America , " he told " GMA . "
McCain added , " There is clearly a continued threat of drugs pouring into the United States of America , which can harm us and our young people very badly . "
The Coma Cluster is one of the densest known clusters of galaxies , containing thousands of elliptical and spherical star systems .
The entire cluster is huge , more than 20 million light - years in diameter .
It ’s also very far away , over 300 million light years distant .
But no telescope brings the Coma Cluster closer than the Hubble Space Telescope , and a new Hubble image has captured the magnificent starry population in one area of the Coma Cluster with the Advanced Camera for Surveys .
The above Hubble image focuses on an area that is roughly one - third of the way out from the center of the whole cluster .
One bright spiral galaxy is visible in the upper left of the image ( see below for a close - up of this galaxy ) .
It is distinctly brighter and bluer than the galaxies surrounding it .
A series of dusty spiral arms appears reddish brown against the whiter disc of the galaxy , and suggests that this galaxy has been disturbed at some point in the past .
The other galaxies in the image are either elliptical galaxies , S0 ( s - zero ) galaxies or background galaxies that are far beyond the Coma Cluster sphere .
Ellipticals are featureless â€œfuzz - balls , â€ pale golden brown in color and contain populations of old stars .
Both dwarf and giant ellipticals are found in abundance in the Coma Cluster .
Farther out from the centre of the cluster there are several spiral galaxies .
These galaxies contain clouds of cold gas that are giving birth to new stars .
Spiral arms and dust lanes â€œaccessoriseâ€  these bright bluish - white galaxies , which have a distinctive disc structure .
S0 ( S - zero ) galaxies form a morphological class of objects between the better known elliptical and spiral galaxies .
They consist of older stars and show little evidence of recent star formation , but they do show some structure â€ ” perhaps a bar or a ring that may eventually give rise to more disc - like features .
This image zooms in on one area of the new Hubble image , the stunning Lenticular galaxy ( in the lower left of the first image ) with numerous background galaxies visible as well .
The cluster ’s position in space â€ “ near the Milky Way ’s north poleâ€ ” places it in an area not obscured by dust and gas , making it easily visible from Earth .

George Bush insists that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
So why , six years ago , did the CIA give the Iranians blueprints to build a bomb ?
She had probably done this a dozen times before .
Modern digital technology had made clandestine communications with overseas agents seem routine .
Back in the cold war , contacting a secret agent in Moscow or Beijing was a dangerous , labour - intensive process that could take days or even weeks .
But by 2004 , it was possible to send high - speed , encrypted messages directly and instantaneously from CIA headquarters to agents in the field who were equipped with small , covert personal communications devices .
So the officer at CIA headquarters assigned to handle communications with the agency 's spies in Iran probably did n't think twice when she began her latest download .
With a few simple commands , she sent a secret data flow to one of the Iranian agents in the CIA 's spy network .
Just as she had done so many times before .
But this time , the ease and speed of the technology betrayed her .
The CIA officer had made a disastrous mistake .
She had sent information to one Iranian agent that exposed an entire spy network ; the data could be used to identify virtually every spy the CIA had inside Iran .
Mistake piled on mistake .
As the CIA later learned , the Iranian who received the download was a double agent .
The agent quickly turned the data over to Iranian security officials , and it enabled them to " roll up " the CIA 's network throughout Iran .
CIA sources say that several of the Iranian agents were arrested and jailed , while the fates of some of the others is still unknown .
This espionage disaster , of course , was not reported .
It left the CIA virtually blind in Iran , unable to provide any significant intelligence on one of the most critical issues facing the US - whether Tehran was about to go nuclear .
In fact , just as President Bush and his aides were making the case in 2004 and 2005 that Iran was moving rapidly to develop nuclear weapons , the American intelligence community found itself unable to provide the evidence to back up the administration 's public arguments .
On the heels of the CIA 's failure to provide accurate pre-war intelligence on Iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction , the agency was once again clueless in the Middle East .
In the spring of 2005 , in the wake of the CIA 's Iranian disaster , Porter Goss , its new director , told President Bush in a White House briefing that the CIA really did n't know how close Iran was to becoming a nuclear power .
But it 's worse than that .
Deep in the bowels of the CIA , someone must be nervously , but very privately , wondering : " Whatever happened to those nuclear blueprints we gave to the Iranians ? "
The story dates back to the Clinton administration and February 2000 , when one frightened Russian scientist walked Vienna 's winter streets .
The Russian had good reason to be afraid .
He was walking around Vienna with blueprints for a nuclear bomb .
To be precise , he was carrying technical designs for a TBA 480 high - voltage block , otherwise known as a " firing set " , for a Russian - designed nuclear weapon .
He held in his hands the knowledge needed to create a perfect implosion that could trigger a nuclear chain reaction inside a small spherical core .
It was one of the greatest engineering secrets in the world , providing the solution to one of a handful of problems that separated nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia from rogue countries such as Iran that were desperate to join the nuclear club but had so far fallen short .
The Russian , who had defected to the US years earlier , still could n't believe the orders he had received from CIA headquarters .
The CIA had given him the nuclear blueprints and then sent him to Vienna to sell them - or simply give them - to the Iranian representatives to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
With the Russian doing its bidding , the CIA appeared to be about to help Iran leapfrog one of the last remaining engineering hurdles blocking its path to a nuclear weapon .
The dangerous irony was not lost on the Russian - the IAEA was an international organisation created to restrict the spread of nuclear technology .
The Russian was a nuclear engineer in the pay of the CIA , which had arranged for him to become an American citizen and funded him to the tune of $ 5,000 a month .
It seemed like easy money , with few strings attached .
Until now .
The CIA was placing him on the front line of a plan that seemed to be completely at odds with the interests of the US , and it had taken a lot of persuading by his CIA case officer to convince him to go through with what appeared to be a rogue operation .
The case officer worked hard to convince him - even though he had doubts about the plan as well .
As he was sweet - talking the Russian into flying to Vienna , the case officer wondered whether he was involved in an illegal covert action .
Should he expect to be hauled before a congressional committee and grilled because he was the officer who helped give nuclear blueprints to Iran ?
The code name for this operation was Merlin ; to the officer , that seemed like a wry tip - off that nothing about this programme was what it appeared to be .
He did his best to hide his concerns from his Russian agent .
The Russian 's assignment from the CIA was to pose as an unemployed and greedy scientist who was willing to sell his soul - and the secrets of the atomic bomb - to the highest bidder .
By hook or by crook , the CIA told him , he was to get the nuclear blueprints to the Iranians .
They would quickly recognise their value and rush them back to their superiors in Tehran .
The plan had been laid out for the defector during a CIA - financed trip to San Francisco , where he had meetings with CIA officers and nuclear experts mixed in with leisurely wine - tasting trips to Sonoma County .
In a luxurious San Francisco hotel room , a senior CIA official involved in the operation talked the Russian through the details of the plan .
He brought in experts from one of the national laboratories to go over the blueprints that he was supposed to give the Iranians .
The senior CIA officer could see that the Russian was nervous , and so he tried to downplay the significance of what they were asking him to do .
He said the CIA was mounting the operation simply to find out where the Iranians were with their nuclear programme .
This was just an intelligence - gathering effort , the CIA officer said , not an illegal attempt to give Iran the bomb .
He suggested that the Iranians already had the technology he was going to hand over to them .
It was all a game .
Nothing too serious .
On paper , Merlin was supposed to stunt the development of Tehran 's nuclear programme by sending Iran 's weapons experts down the wrong technical path .
The CIA believed that once the Iranians had the blueprints and studied them , they would believe the designs were usable and so would start to build an atom bomb based on the flawed designs .
But Tehran would get a big surprise when its scientists tried to explode their new bomb .
Instead of a mushroom cloud , the Iranian scientists would witness a disappointing fizzle .
The Iranian nuclear programme would suffer a humiliating setback , and Tehran 's goal of becoming a nuclear power would have been delayed by several years .
In the meantime , the CIA , by watching Iran 's reaction to the blueprints , would have gained a wealth of information about the status of Iran 's weapons programme , which has been shrouded in secrecy .
The Russian studied the blueprints the CIA had given him .
Within minutes of being handed the designs , he had identified a flaw .
" This is n't right , " he told the CIA officers gathered around the hotel room .
" There is something wrong . "
His comments prompted stony looks , but no straight answers from the CIA men .
No one in the meeting seemed surprised by the Russian 's assertion that the blueprints did n't look quite right , but no one wanted to enlighten him further on the matter , either .
In fact , the CIA case officer who was the Russian 's personal handler had been stunned by his statement .
During a break , he took the senior CIA officer aside .
" He was n't supposed to know that , " the CIA case officer told his superior .
" He was n't supposed to find a flaw . "
" Do n't worry , " the senior CIA officer calmly replied .
" It does n't matter . "
The CIA case officer could n't believe the senior CIA officer 's answer , but he managed to keep his fears from the Russian , and continued to train him for his mission .
After their trip to San Francisco , the case officer handed the Russian a sealed envelope with the nuclear blueprints inside .
He was told not to open the envelope under any circumstances .
He was to follow the CIA 's instructions to find the Iranians and give them the envelope with the documents inside .
Keep it simple , and get out of Vienna safe and alive , the Russian was told .
But the defector had his own ideas about how he might play that game .
The CIA had discovered that a high - ranking Iranian official would be travelling to Vienna and visiting the Iranian mission to the IAEA , and so the agency decided to send the Russian to Vienna at the same time .
It was hoped that he could make contact with either the Iranian representative to the IAEA or the visitor from Tehran .
In Vienna , however , the Russian unsealed the envelope with the nuclear blueprints and included a personal letter of his own to the Iranians .
No matter what the CIA told him , he was going to hedge his bets .
There was obviously something wrong with the blueprints - so he decided to mention that fact to the Iranians in his letter .
They would certainly find flaws for themselves , and if he did n't tell them first , they would never want to deal with him again .
The Russian was thus warning the Iranians as carefully as he could that there was a flaw somewhere in the nuclear blueprints , and he could help them find it .
At the same time , he was still going through with the CIA 's operation in the only way he thought would work .
The Russian soon found 19 Heinstrasse , a five - storey office and apartment building with a flat , pale green and beige facade in a quiet , slightly down - at - heel neighbourhood in Vienna 's north end .
Amid the list of Austrian tenants , there was one simple line : " PM / Iran . "
The Iranians clearly did n't want publicity .
An Austrian postman helped him .
As the Russian stood by , the postman opened the building door and dropped off the mail .
The Russian followed suit ; he realised that he could leave his package without actually having to talk to anyone .
He slipped through the front door , and hurriedly shoved his envelope through the inner - door slot at the Iranian office .
The Russian fled the mission without being seen .
He was deeply relieved that he had made the hand - off without having to come face to face with a real live Iranian .
He flew back to the US without being detected by either Austrian security or , more importantly , Iranian intelligence .
Just days after the Russian dropped off his package at the Iranian mission , the National Security Agency reported that an Iranian official in Vienna abruptly changed his schedule , making airline reservations to fly home to Iran .
The odds were that the nuclear blueprints were now in Tehran .
The Russian scientist 's fears about the operation seemed well founded .
He was the front man for what may have been one of the most reckless operations in the modern history of the CIA , one that may have helped put nuclear weapons in the hands of a charter member of what President George W Bush has called the " axis of evil " .
Operation Merlin has been one of the most closely guarded secrets in the Clinton and Bush administrations .
It 's not clear who originally came up with the idea , but the plan was first approved by Clinton .
After the Russian scientist 's fateful trip to Vienna , however , the Merlin operation was endorsed by the Bush administration , possibly with an eye toward repeating it against North Korea or other dangerous states .
Several former CIA officials say that the theory behind Merlin - handing over tainted weapon designs to confound one of America 's adversaries - is a trick that has been used many times in past operations , stretching back to the cold war .
But in previous cases , such Trojan horse operations involved conventional weapons ; none of the former officials had ever heard of the CIA attempting to conduct this kind of high - risk operation with designs for a nuclear bomb .
The former officials also said these kind of programmes must be closely monitored by senior CIA managers in order to control the flow of information to the adversary .
If mishandled , they could easily help an enemy accelerate its weapons development .
That may be what happened with Merlin .
Iran has spent nearly 20 years trying to develop nuclear weapons , and in the process has created a strong base of sophisticated scientists knowledgeable enough to spot flaws in nuclear blueprints .
Tehran also obtained nuclear blueprints from the network of Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan , and so already had workable blueprints against which to compare the designs obtained from the CIA .
Nuclear experts say that they would thus be able to extract valuable information from the blueprints while ignoring the flaws .
" If [ the flaw ] is bad enough , " warned a nuclear weapons expert with the IAEA , " they will find it quite quickly .
That would be my fear "

Modern cells are like microscopic cities :
They have power plants ( mitochondria ) , trash dumps ( lysosomes ) , local government ( the nucleus , with DNA serving as the legal charter ) , and many other activities going on inside their boundaries .
They also have a border patrol in the form of a double - layered membrane that uses a series of protein - powered pumps , pores and channels to let nutrients in and keep other chemicals and substances out .
But , cells were very different when life began 3.5 billion to four billion years ago .
Rather than small metropolises , they were more like a purse that carried instructions — consisting of just a membrane with genetic information inside .
They lacked the structures and proteins that now make them tick .
The question is :
How then were they able to take in the nutrients necessary to survive and reproduce ?
Harvard Medical School researchers report in Nature that they have built a model of what they believe the very first living cell may have looked like , which contains a strip of genetic material surrounded by a fatty membrane .
The membranes of modern cells consist of a double layer of fatty acids known as phospholipids .
But in designing a membrane for their cell , scientists worked with much simpler fatty acids that they believe existed on a primeval Earth , when the first cell likely formed .
The key , says study co-author Jack Szostak , a Harvard geneticist , was to develop one porous enough to let in needed nutrients ( such as nucleotides , the units that make up genetic material , or DNA ) but strong enough to protect the genetic material inside and keep it from slipping out after replicating .
In an attempt to duplicate an early cell , scientists put fatty acids ( that were likely membrane candidates ) and a strip of DNA into a test tube of water .
While in there , the fatty acids formed into a ring , or membrane , around the genetic segment .
The researchers then added nucleotides — units of genetic material — to the test tube to determine whether they would penetrate the membrane and copy the DNA inside it .
Their findings : the nucleotides did enter the cell , latch onto and replicate the DNA over 24 hours .
What scientists now must figure out , Szostak says , is how the original and copycat DNA strands separated and this early cell divided or reproduced .
" We 're trying to solve a whole series of problems , step by step , " he says , " and build up to replicating an evolving system . "
David Deamer , a biomolecular engineer at the University of California , Santa Cruz , says he believes the team is on its way to making a prototype of a primitive cell that has " essentially all the basic properties of life . "
I thought we would play a new game today .
And it ’s kind of easy .
You ’re just going to match the statement with the person .
Are you ready ?
Okay , I ’m going to give you four media personalities who have written or said some very stupid things the past couple of weeks .
Let ’s see if you can make the match .
A. Jemele Hill – columnist , ESPN.com .
B. Johnny Miller – golf commentator , NBC Sports .
C. Dick Enberg – tennis commentator , NBC Sports .
D. Don Imus – radio blowhard .
1. Upon being informed of the travails of Adam “ Pacman ” Jones , then being told that Jones is an African - American : “ Well .
There you go .
Now we know . ”
2. “ Rooting for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a victim . ”
3. Rocco Mediate “ looks like the guy who cleans Tiger 's swimming pool . ”
And “ Guys with the name ‘ Rocco ’ do n’t get on the trophy , do they ? ”
4. “ Roger Federer on his way .
I wonder how they transport him ?
One of those Sultan chairs with four Nubian Slaves take him into our studio . ”
ANSWERS :
A. Jemele Hill : 2 . “ Rooting for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a victim . ”
B. Johnny Miller : 3 . Rocco Mediate “ looks like the guy who cleans Tiger ’s swimming pool . ”
And “ Guys with the name ‘ Rocco ’ do n’t get on the trophy , do they ? ”
C. Dick Enberg : 4 . “ Roger Federer on his way .
I wonder how they transport him ?
One of those Sultan chairs with four Nubian Slaves take him into our studio . ”
D. Don Imus : 1 . “ Well .
There you go .
Now we know . ”
Well , Hill and Miller have apologized for their comments .
We ’ve yet to hear from Enberg .
And Imus has gone to the misunderstood card .
Well , here ’s the actual audio .
So you tell me , was it taken out of context ?
I do n’t think so .
And one would think that after what happened to Imus last year he would have learned a little lesson .
But I guess one would think wrong .
So that ’s it for today .
Thanks for playing today ’s edition of stupid media personalities .

Rewriting one law of physics is worse than trying to eat one peanut .
A thrint was master over every intelligent beast .
This was the Powergiver ’s primal decree , made before he made the stars .
So said all of the twelve thrintun religions , though they fought insanely over other matters .
p. 85
Putting a monkey wrench in machinery is often the only way to force somebody to repair , replace , or redesign the machinery .
Especially legal or social machinery .

heart
The bleeding symbol does not represent any known revolutionary organization . …
Yes , the bleeding heart was something else again . … A signature .
He was sick of having to be afraid . …
If he stopped being afraid , even for an instant , he could be killed !
A ramrobot had been the first to see Mount Lookitthat .
Ramrobots had been first visitors to all the settled worlds .
The interstellar ramscoop robots , with an unrestricted fuel supply culled from interstellar hydrogen , could travel between stars at speeds approaching that of light .

Matthew Leiah Keller sat beneath a watershed tree and brooded .
Other children played all around him , but they ignored Matt .
So did two teachers on monitor duty .
People usually ignored
Matt when he wanted to be alone .
Uncle Matt was gone .
Gone to a fate so horrible that the adults would n't even talk about it .
Ch. 1 : The Ramrobot
Uncle Matt was gone .
Gone to a fate so horrible that the adults would n't even talk about it .
The medical revolution that began with the beginning of the twentieth century had warped all human society for five hundred years .
America had adjusted to Eli Whitney 's cotton gin in less than half that time .
As with the gin , the effects would never quite die out .
But already society was swinging back to what had once been normal .
Slowly ; but there was motion .
In Brazil a small but growing , alliance agitated for the removal of the death penalty for habitual traffic offenders .
They would be opposed , but they would win .
Ch. 1 : The Ramrobot
From the beginning there had been a revolutionary group .
Its name had changed several times , and Matt had no idea what it was now .
He had never known a revolutionary .
He had no particular desire to be one .
They accomplished nothing , except to fill the Hospital 's organ banks .
How could they , when the crew controlled every weapon and every watt of power on Mount Lookitthat ?
If this was a nest of rebels , then they had worked out a good cover .
Many of the merrymakers had no hearing aids , and these seemed to be the ones who did n't know anyone here .
Like Matt himself .
In the midst of a reasonably genuine open - house brawl , certain people listened to voices only they could hear .

" You look like a girl with a secret , " Matt said .
" I think it must be the smile . "
She moved closer to him , which was very close , and lowered her voice .
" Can you keep a secret ? "
Matt smiled with one side of his mouth to show that he knew what was coming .
She said it anyway .
" So can I . " Ch. 2 : The Sons Of Earth

The organ banks would be supplied for years .
Not only would the crew have a full supply , which they always did anyway , but there would be spare parts for exceptional servants of the regime ; i.e. , for civil servants such as Jesus Pietro and his men .
Even the colonists would benefit .
It was not at all unusual for the Hospital to treat a sick but deserving colonist if the medical supplies were sufficient .
The Hospital treated everyone they could .
It reminded the colonists that the crew ruled in their name and had their interests at heart .
And the Sons of Earth was dead .
All but one man , and from his picture he was n't old enough to be dangerous .
Nonetheless Jesus Pietro had his picture tacked to the Hospital bulletin boards and sent a copy to the newscast station with the warning that he was wanted for questioning .
It was not until dawn , when he was settling down to sleep , that he remembered who belonged to that face .

Any citizen , with the help of the organ banks , can live as long as it takes his central nervous system to wear out .
This can be a very long time if his circulatory system is kept functioning .
…
But the citizen , cannot take more out of the organ banks than goes into them .
He must do his utmost to see that they are supplied . …
The only feasible method of supplying the organ banks is through execution of criminals . …
A criminal 's pirated body can save a dozen lives .
There is now no valid argument against capital punishment for any given crime ; for all such argument seeks to prove that killing a man does society no good .
Hence the citizen , who wants to live as long and as healthily as possible , will vote any crime into a capital crime if the organ banks are short of material .
…
Cite Earth 's capital punishment for false advertising , income tax evasion , air pollution , having children without a license .
The wonder was that it had taken so long to pass these laws .

There were organ banks all over the world , inadequately supplied by people kind enough to will their bodies to medical science .
How useful is the body of a man who dies of old age ?
How fast can you reach a car accident ?
And in 2043 , Arkansas , which had never rescinded the death penalty , made the organ banks the official state method of execution .
The idea had spread like wildfire .... like a moral plague , as one critic of the time had put it .

Jesus Pietro was n't used to dealing with ghosts .
It would require brand new techniques .
Grimly he set out to evolve them .

Jesus Pietro was worried .
The Sons of Earth , if they got this far , would go straight to the vivarium to free their compatriots .
But if Matthew Keller was his own agent ...
If the ghost of Alpha Plateau was not a rebel , but a thing with its own unpredictable purpose ...
Jesus Pietro worried .

" I'm no historian , " said Harry .
" But morals are morals .
What 's unethical here and now is unethical anywhere , anytime . "
" Kane , you 're wrong .
It is ethical to execute a man for theft ? "
" Of course . "
" Did you know that there was once a vastly detailed science of rehabilitation for criminals ?
It was a branch of psychology , naturally , but it was by far the largest such branch .
By the middle of century twenty - one , nearly two - thirds of all criminals could eventually be released as cured . "
" That 's silly .
Why go to all that trouble when the organ banks must have been crying for — Oh .
I see .
No organ banks . "

Someone or something was in this room , something or someone with the power to make people forget . …
He was reaching for the stunner on his desk when something caught his eye .
It was the dossier for Matthew Keller , senior .
A crude drawing defaced its yellow cover .
Two open arcs , joined , in black ink .
Three small closed loops beneath .
The bleeding heart .
It certainly had n't been there before .
Jesus Pietro opened the folder .
He could smell his own fear , and feel it , in the cool perspiration that soaked his shirt .
As if he'd been afraid for hours .

He was sick of having to be afraid .
It was a situation to drive a man right out of his skull .
If he stopped being afraid , even for an instant , he could be killed !
But now , at least for the moment , he could stop listening for footsteps , stop trying to look in all directions at once .
A sonic stunner was a surer bet than a hypothetical , undependable psi power .
It was real , cold and hard in his hand .

Millard Parlette was near exhaustion .
…
Sometimes it seemed to him , that he was at the end of his life , that he'd waited just long enough to meet this — the crisis he'd foreseen a hundred years ago .
…
Known rebels moved freely through the Hospital , and no one could touch them .
Their attitude toward the police was rude and contemptuous .
Rumor had it that Millard Parlette was drafting new laws to further restrict police power .
It did n't help that the rumors were true .

The wealth of the universe is all over your head ...
We follow the scientists around and look over their shoulders .
They 're watching their feet : provable mistakes are bad for them .
We 're looking as far ahead as we can , and we do n't get penalized for mistakes .
On the relationship between science and science - fiction .
The wealth of the universe is all over your head .
We need to take command of the solar system to gain that wealth , and to escape the sea of paper our government is becoming , and for some decent chance of stopping a Dinosaur Killer asteroid .
We 've fallen way behind .
Building one space station for everyone was and is insane : we should have built a dozen .
Cheap superconductors imply maglev trains everywhere .
Computers could get big again , with RAM / ROM rising by powers of forty and fifty , if superconductors shed the heat .
Laser handguns against superconducting armor .
I 'm not predicting ; I just love playing with superconductors .
Here is where the predictions failed :
We did n't take Cargo Cult mentality into account : " if somebody has something I do n't , he must have stolen it . "
We did n't understand how good we could get at communication — when you have something that someone else does n't , the whole damn planet knows it .
Original version , and the latest revision , of " how the Universe works " written 29 January 2002 , published in Analog Magazine ( November 2002 )
It is easier to destroy than create .
Stories to end all stories on a given topic , do n't .
No technique works if it is n't used .
If what you have to say is important and / or difficult to follow , use the simplest language possible .
If the reader does n't get it then , let it not be your fault .
1a ) Never throw shit at an armed man .
1b ) Never stand next to someone who is throwing shit at an armed man .
2 ) Never fire a laser at a mirror .
3 ) Mother Nature does n't care if you 're having fun .
4 ) Giving up freedom for security has begun to look naive .
Even to me .
Many of you were ahead of me on this —
Three out of four hijacked airplanes destroyed the World Trade Center and a piece of the Pentagon in 2001 .
How is it possible that those planes were taken using only five perps armed with knives ?
It was possible because all those hundreds of passengers had been carefully stripped of every possible weapon .
We may want to reconsider this approach .
It does n't work in high schools either .
Earlier version : 4 ) F x S = k .
The product of Freedom and Security is a constant .
To gain more freedom of thought and / or action , you must give up some security , and vice versa .
Even to me .

6 ) It is easier to destroy than create .
Bin Laden tore down the World Trade Center ?
Let 's see him build one .
If human beings did n't have a strong preference for creation , nothing would get built , ever .
7 ) Any damn fool can predict the past .
Unsourced variant :
Any damned fool can predict the past .
And most do .
8 ) History never repeats itself .
9 ) Ethics change with technology .
10 ) Anarchy is the least stable of social structures .
11 ) There is a time and place for tact .
And there are times when tact is entirely misplaced .
16 ) There is no cause so right that one cannot find a fool following it .
To prove a point , one may seek out a foolish Socialist , thirteenth century Liberal , Scientologist , High Frontier advocate , Mensa member , science fiction fan , Jim Bakker acolyte , Christian , witch , or fanatical devotee of Special Interest Lib .
It does n't really reflect on the cause itself .
Ad hominem argument saves time , but it 's still a fallacy .

2 ) Never be embarrased or ashamed about anything you choose to write .
( Think of this before you send it to a market )
3 ) Stories to end all stories on a given topic , do n't .
4 ) It is a sin to waste the reader 's time .

Stylistic innovations , contorted story lines or none , exotic or genderless pronouns , internal inconsistencies , the recipe for preparing your lover as a cannibal banquet : feel free .

Frustrated by years of on - and - off peace talks with Israel , Palestinians are losing hope for an independent homeland , and some are proposing a radically different cause : a shared state with equal rights for Palestinians and Jews .
A “ two - state solution ” has been the basis for Israeli - Palestinian negotiations for nearly 15 years and remains the declared aim of both groups ’ highest elected leaders and the Bush administration .
But its advocates are increasingly on the defensive , and not just against militant Islamists and Jewish settlers who have long opposed partitioning the land .
Majorities on both sides dismiss the current U.S. - backed peace talks as futile .
And a small but growing number of moderate Palestinians contend that Israel ’s terms for independence offer less than they could gain in a single democratic state combining Israel , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
As a result , the 60th anniversary this month of Israel ’s birth is a time of insecurity and flux .
Conventional wisdom about the long - standing formula for peace is being turned on its head .
Advertisement
No Israeli leader accepts the idea of sharing power with Palestinians ; nor has such a plan been offered to the Israeli government .
But a collapse of the two - state effort would leave Israel in de facto control of a region where by the next generation , Jews probably will be a minority .
That scenario inspires Hazem Kawasmi , who recently gave up on the two - state ideal and runs brainstorming workshops in the West Bank on single - state proposals .
Sooner or later , the former Palestinian Authority official predicts , the growing burden of occupation and threat of Islamic extremism will make Israelis receptive to the idea of a bi-national system that protects the rights of Jews .
“ Israel can not be a dominating power forever , ” Kawasmi , 43 , said between puffs on a water pipe in a cafe in Ramallah , the West Bank ’s administrative center .
“ Time is on our side . ”

Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East War , but efforts to incorporate the territories by encouraging massive Jewish settlements fell short .
It took a generation after the war for Israeli and secular Palestinian leaders to recognize each other and start discussing statehood for the occupied territories .
The Palestinians ’ rethinking of that goal has been influenced by Hamas ’ ascendancy .
Its rise has unnerved moderate Palestinians who do n’t want to be ruled by the militant Islamic group and made many in Israel , which Hamas refuses to formally recognize , more averse to a two - state accord .
The near - daily rocket attacks from Hamas - controlled Gaza have turned Israel ’s defense minister into a powerful critic of a peace process he once led .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , struggling to propel peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by the secular Fatah movement , warned last week that the lack of progress was causing younger Palestinians to give up on the goal of an independent state .
Advertisement
“ Increasingly , the Palestinians who talk about a two - state solution are my age , ” said Rice , who is 53 .
The U.S. revived the peace talks in November with the aim of an accord by the end of President Bush ’s term , but disillusionment set in quickly .
Hebrew University and the Palestine Center for Policy and Survey Research reported that three - fourths of the Palestinians and just over half the Israelis they polled in March said the talks serve no purpose and should be halted .
Other polls show that at least one - fourth of Palestinians favor a single state .
“ The number of people who believe in two states for two peoples is decreasing , and that worries me , ” said Yasser Abed - Rabbo , a Palestinian official involved in the talks .
“ And I ’m talking about a circle of rational intellectuals , people with an open mind .
On the street , the two - state idea has become a joke . ”
Fatah ’s leadership has begun a quiet , informal debate of its options if talks for an independent state fail .
Advertisement
The emergence of one - state proposals , said Kadura Fares , a member of Fatah ’s revolutionary council , are “ a sign that the current strategy has been exhausted and it ’s time to rethink all our goals . ”
Ali Jarbawi , an independent West Bank political scientist who advises the Palestinian leadership , has urged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to resign and abolish the government , which would oblige Israel to take direct responsibility for managing the West Bank and Gaza and paying public employees .
“ I would say , ‘ Be my guest .
Continue your occupation .
But we ’re going to declare this is all one state and ask for equal rights .
Are you going to be able to keep us under control for another 40 years ? ’ ” Jarbawi said .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert cited just such a scenario last year to make the case for shedding the territories quickly , while the Palestinians still have leaders who want their own state .
Advertisement
Israel , he warned , faces a demographic threat .
There are 5.7 million Jews and 1.4 million Arab citizens in Israel and its West Bank settlements , according to Israel ’s Central Bureau of Statistics ; the bureau ’s Palestinian counterpart tallies nearly 3.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza .
By 2025 , Israeli demographer Sergio Della Pergola predicts , Jews will make up no more than 46 % of the people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea , an area slightly smaller than Maryland .
Rid of the territories , Olmert told reporters in November , Israel would have a sustainable Jewish majority within its borders , enabling it to preserve its Jewish character within a democracy .
“ If the day comes when the two - state solution collapses and we face a South African - style struggle for equal voting rights , the state of Israel is finished , ” he said .
Advertisement
But resistance to a two - state accord has risen not only from right - wing allies of Olmert who support continued Jewish settlement in the West Bank but also from Ehud Barak , who leads the dovish Labor Party .
As prime minister in 2000 , Barak made Israel ’s first concrete offer of a Palestinian state .
( Yasser Arafat rejected his terms . )
Now defense minister , Barak has privately dismissed the current talks as “ a fantasy . ”
Until Israel upgrades its missile defenses , which could take several years , Barak says , he favors keeping troops in the West Bank and continuing frequent incursions into Gaza .
Israel withdrew its army bases and civilian settlements from Gaza in 2005 .
Many Palestinians take Barak ’s shift as a sign that independence is unattainable .

Kawasmi , the former Palestinian Authority official , said his moment of disenchantment came last year in June during an encounter with Israeli peace activists at an unofficial Middle East forum in Italy .
The Jerusalem native had been campaigning 15 years for an independent Palestinian state .
The dream had brought him home from studies in England in 1994 to help the newly created Palestinian Authority set up a ministry of economy .
But the Israeli peaceniks dismissed two cherished Palestinian aspirations .
Like Olmert ’s government , they wanted to avoid talk of giving Palestinian refugees and their families the right of return to homes in Israel that they fled in 1948 or of sharing Jerusalem as capital of both Israel and a Palestinian state .
At that moment , Kawasmi said , he realized “ there is zero chance ” for a two - state solution .
He did n’t sleep well for months .
Then he embraced the single - state option , which had been debated for several years among Palestinians living abroad , and set out to create a buzz for it in the territories .
Advertisement
Several dozen intellectuals and activists are engaged in the debate , in books , newspaper articles , seminars and discussions on such websites as Electronic Intifada .
Some call for a power - sharing government , others for a federation with separate administrations for Palestinians and Jews .
Sari Nusseibeh , president of Al Quds University in Jerusalem , suggests that many Palestinians would feel more at home in a democracy shared with Israelis than in a Palestinian state run by Hamas .
A bi-national system , Nusseibeh said , would “ need to come about by consent and not by force ; it will need a complete new strategy and thinking . ”
Perhaps after decades of fruitless bloodshed , he said , “ we might find ourselves having no option but to coexist within one state . ”
Advertisement
A single state , other proponents say , would resolve disputes that have long bedeviled peace talks .
Jews could keep their settlements , the thinking goes , but Palestinians , now restricted to a disproportionately small area , could live and travel anywhere the country .
So could returning Palestinian refugees .
Most Israelis dismiss single - state proposals as recipes for dystopia or tactics in a Hamas - guided scheme to overrun the Jews and impose Islamic rule .
“ Such an idea of one country with two peoples , it will never happen , ” said Benjamin Ben-Eliezer , the infrastructure minister .
“ Bloodshed will happen .
The Arabs will not accept us .
We will not accept them . ”
But Palestinians who favor the idea say they would have no problem living with Jews as equals .
If Jews were to give up their superior status and allow Palestinians the right to vote and move about the country , they say , Islamic extremists would lose their appeal .
Advertisement
“ I ’m envisioning a state where Jewish , Muslim and Christian communities live equally with full rights , ” Kawasmi said .
If Israelis cannot accept that , “ it ’s up to them to face an Islamic power that will not accept them . ”
It might be months or years , he acknowledges , before Palestinian leaders embrace the single - state vision and another generation before Israelis take it seriously .
He plans to spend the year hammering out a detailed proposal and getting it launched by a political party , even if he has to start one himself .
Israelis , meanwhile , are weighing the choices that will shape the country ’s seventh decade if the two - state talks fail : Israel could declare that the wall it has built along the length of the West Bank is now a border and retreat behind it , unilaterally defining an Israel with a Jewish majority but exposing itself to rocket fire .
Or it could try to prevent the attacks by occupying the territory more thoroughly , and re-occupying Gaza , with the risks of long - term fatigue and international condemnation .
Either option could mean years of conflict , an outlook that weighs on Israel as it celebrates 60 years of national rebirth and achievement .

Meron Benvenisti , a historian and former deputy mayor of Jerusalem , is one of the few prominent Israelis who see a way out by sharing a state with the Palestinians .
He has proposed that Israeli Jews start debating the shape of such a state .
They could best protect Israel ’s gains and the haven of a Jewish homeland , he suggests , by opting for a federal system with autonomous administrations for Jews and Palestinians .
“ Israelis and Palestinians are sinking together into the mud of ‘ one state , ’ ” he writes .
“ We need a model that fits this reality .
. . .
The question is no longer whether it will be bi-national , but which model to choose . ”

Middle East milestones
Israel ’s declaration of statehood 60 years ago this month led to decades of conflict with the Palestinians over the land .
It was only in the 1990s that the goal of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel became the basis for peace negotiations .
Here is how the conflict over statehood evolved :
Advertisement
November 1947 : The United Nations approves a British plan to partition Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states .
The Arabs reject it .
May 1948 : Israel declares its independence as a Jewish state .
An estimated 700,000 Palestinians are displaced .
June 1967 : The 1967 Middle East War ends with Israel ’s capture of the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan , the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt , and the Golan Heights from Syria .
July 1968 : The Palestinian leadership declares the area of Palestine under the British mandate , from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean , “ an indivisible territorial unit ” and endorses armed struggle to recover it .
Advertisement
December 1988 : Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accepts the goal of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel .
September 1993 : As part of the Oslo peace accords , Arafat ’s Palestine Liberation Organization formally recognizes Israel ’s right to exist , laying the groundwork for talks on a separate Palestinian state .
July 2000 : Prime Minister Ehud Barak makes Israel ’s first offer of statehood to the Palestinians in talks brokered by President Clinton .
Arafat rejects the terms .
November 2007 : Pressed by President Bush , Israel and the Palestinians launch new talks on Palestinian statehood .
These hardy creatures somehow escape the usual drawback of asexuality – extinction – and the MBL ’s David Mark Welch , Matthew Meselson , and their colleagues are finding out how .
In two related papers published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , the team proposes an interesting hypothesis : Bdelloid rotifers have been able to give up sex and survive because they have evolved an extraordinary efficient mechanism for repairing harmful mutations to their DNA .
...
In animals that do have sex , DNA repair is accomplished during meiosis , when chromosomes pair up ( one from the father , one from the mother ) and “ fit ” genes on one chromosome can serve as templates to repair damaged genes on the other chromosome .
The bdelloid , though , always seems to reproduce asexually , by making a clone of itself .
How then , does it cope with deleterious mutations ?
MBL adjunct scientist Matthew Meselson and Eugene Gladyshev , both of Harvard University , demonstrate the enormous DNA repair capacity of bdelloid rotifers by zapping them with ionizing radiation ( gamma rays ) , which has the effect of shattering its DNA into many pieces .
“ We kept exposing them to more and more radiation , and they did n’t die and they did n’t die and they did n’t die , ” says Mark Welch .
Even at five times the levels of radiation that all other animals are known to endure , the bdelloids were able to continue reproducing .
“ Because there is no source of such intense ionizing radiation on Earth , except if we make it , there is no way these organisms could have evolved to be radiation resistant , ” says Mark Welch .
Instead , they propose that bdelloids ’
DNA repair capacity evolved due to a different environmental adaptation – tolerance of extreme dryness .
Bdelloids , which live in ephemeral aquatic habitats such as temporary freshwater pools and on mosses , are able to survive complete desiccation ( drying out ) at any stage of their life cycle .
They just curl up and go dormant for weeks , months , or years , and when water becomes available , they spring back to life .
Mark Welch and his colleagues showed that desiccation , like ionizing radiation , breaks up the rotifers ’ DNA into many pieces .
Presumably , the same mechanisms they use to survive desiccation as part of their life cycle also protect them from ionizing radiation .
Deinococcus radiodurans
Deinococcus geothermalis
One feature that may confer exceptional DNA repair capacity on the bdelloids is described in the team ’s second PNAS paper .
Here , they give evidence that the bdelloid rotifer , like most animals , originally had two copies of each chromosome .
But at some point in its evolution , it underwent a “ whole - genome duplication , ” giving it four copies of each chromosome and hence of each gene .
Normally , lineages that undergo whole - genome duplication lose the duplicate genes over time .
The bdelloid , though , has kept most of its duplicate genes throughout its evolutionary history .
“ We believe they have kept most of their duplicate genes because they are serving as templates for DNA repair , ” says Mark Welch .
Yeah , it 's a trick question .
The answer is clearly " no " – unless you 're a bdelloid rotifer
What 's interesting , of course , about these minute but multi-cellular animals is that they are completely asexual , and apparently have been for millions of years .
There are no males , and females reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis .
Although that might seem to imply a rather joyless existence , it has n't stopped the bdelloids from persisting , and even diversifying into more than 370 species .
The conventional evolutionary reason for the invention and predominance of sexual reproduction – apart from the recreational aspect – is that it provides a mechanism for a species to cope with the inevitability of sustaining damage to its DNA .
So why do the bdelloids seem to think they have a better way ?
Before we come to the hypothesized answer , it must be noted that the bdelloids ' ability to repair their DNA is not merely adequate .
It 's spectacularly good : Hmmmm .
That sounds oddly familiar .
Where have we heard about that sort of thing before ?
Oh yes , this is apparently exactly the same thing found in a bacterium ( ) , as discussed here .
And in the closely related bacterial species , , as discussed here
But what the bdelloids do is much more impressive , since they are multicellular eukaryotes , not simple prokaryotic bacteria .
In any case , what't the trick for bdelloids ?

Computer models show major climate shift as a result of closing ozone hole
A new study led by Columbia University researchers has found that the closing of the ozone hole , which is projected to occur sometime in the second half of the 21st century , may significantly affect climate change in the Southern Hemisphere , and therefore , the global climate .
The study appears in the June 13th issue of Science .
The Earth 's ozone layer is located in the lower stratosphere , which lies just above the troposphere ( which begins at the planet 's surface and reaches up to about 12 km ) , catching harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun .
Until late in the last century , widespread usage of household and commercial aerosols containing chlorofluorocarbons ( CFC ) , unstable compounds which are carried into the stratosphere , lead to significant and rapid ozone depletion .
Due to the Montreal Protocol , signed by 191 countries , CFC production worldwide was phased out in 1996 .
Observations in the last few years indicate that ozone depletion has largely halted and is expected to fully reverse .
As a consequence , the new study finds , the Southern Hemisphere climate change may also reverse .
This would be a very tangible outcome of the Montreal Protocol , which has been called the single most successful international agreement to date , and would demonstrate how international treaties are able to make positive changes to the climate system .
" Our results suggest that stratospheric ozone is important for the Southern Hemisphere climate change , and ought to be more carefully considered in the next set of IPCC model integrations , " said Seok - Woo Son , lead - author of the study and a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia 's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science ( SEAS ) .
The team of 10 scientists compared results from two sets of climate models , the first one used by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , released in late 2007 , and the second from the Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion , published by the World Meteorological Organization in 2006 .
In their prediction of future climate , many IPCC models did not consider the expected ozone recovery and its potential impacts on climate change .
The chemistry - climate models used for the 2006 Ozone Assessment , however , predict that the Antarctic ozone hole will achieve full recovery in the second half of this century , and that this may have profound impacts on the surface winds and , likely , on other aspects of the Earth 's climate , including surface temperatures , locations of storm tracks , extent of dry zones , amount of sea ice , and ocean circulation .
In the past few decades , the tropospheric winds in the Southern Hemisphere have been accelerating closer to the planet 's pole as a result of increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing ozone .
This wind change has had a broad range of effects on the Earth 's climate .
The IPCC models predict that this effect will continue , albeit at a slower pace .
In contrast , predictions made by the chemistry - climate models indicate that , as a consequence of ozone recovery — a factor largely ignored by IPCC models — the tropospheric winds in the Southern Hemisphere may actually decelerate in the high latitudes and move toward the equator , potentially reversing the direction of climate change in that hemisphere .
" We were surprised to find that the closing of the ozone hole , which is expected to occur in the next 50 years or so , shows significant effects on the global climate , " said Lorenzo M. Polvani , one of two principle investigators and professor of applied physics and applied mathematics at SEAS .
" This is because stratospheric ozone has not been considered a major player in the climate system . "
Polvani and Son state that more research needs to be conducted to validate their results , and to fully understand how complete ozone recovery will impact the planet 's changing climate .
While previous studies have shown that ozone hole recovery could lead to a warming of the Antarctic , much work remains .
For instance , the chemistry - climate models used in the 2006 Ozone Assessment Report do not include a full ocean circulation , which might affect surface temperatures .
The interactions between a recovering ozone hole , increasing greenhouse gases , ocean currents , and other components of the climate system must still be explored in order to better understand how the Earth 's climate will change in the future .
Properly preparing a glass of absinthe is n't as complicated as you may think .
Absinthe enthusiasts often refer to absinthe preparation as the " absinthe ritual " , but it 's not very different from making a cup of tea .

The Vatican 's official newspaper has endorsed the possibility that the universe could contain intelligent life beyond Earth , while insisting that aliens would be " our brothers " and " children of God " as much as human beings are .
The Pope 's astronomer , José Gabriel Funes , a Jesuit priest , told L'Osservatore Romano that there would be nothing surprising about the existence of intelligent extra-terrestrials .
" Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on Earth , so there could be other beings created by God [ beyond it ] , " he said .
The interview suggests that the Church 's hierarchy may be paving the way to showing that Pope Benedict XVI is more open to the ideas of modern science than he has previously seemed to be .

Pope Benedict has spoken in favour of " intelligent design " in the past and has damned evolutionary ideas that leave no room for God .
Fr Funes , in the interview , admits that , for him , evolution is a given .
He also said that he believed in the Big Bang theory as the most likely explanation for the origin of the universe , and that the Bible should not be held to account for its lack of scientific accuracy .
" Fundamentally , " he said , " the Bible is not a book of science ...
It 's a love letter written by God to his people in the language of two or three thousand years ago ...
So one can not ask the Bible for scientific responses . "
The existence of alien beings would not create a problem for believers , he insisted , " because one can not put limits on the creative freedom of God ...
They would be part of creation . "
Pope Benedict has reminded believers that " Revelation teaches us that [ man ] was created in the image and likeness of God " , and that " man is the only creature on Earth that God has wanted for his own sake " .
Living in Dubai is not wonderful and glamorous , as many would have you believe .
Â
Forget about what youâ€™ve read , seen , and heard ; those shiny buildings and manmade islands are all just smoke and mirrors .
Â
There are so many things wrong with this place that I have decided to compile a list , a must read if you are considering a potential move to Dubai .
1 . There is no standard address system making mail - to - the door delivery impossible .
Â
In fact , it makes anything nearly impossible .
Â
The taxi driver , here for only two days , and having learned English from old Beatles albums has no clue where your house is .
Â
He wonâ€™t tell you that of course , heâ€™ll just keep calling and saying , â€ œOkay , okay .
Â
Yeah , yeah.â€ Â
When you purchase something that requires delivery they do not have an address line , but a box where you are expected to draw a map .
Â
Not able to draw a map ?
Â
Explain like this : I live on the street after the airport road , but before the roundabout .
Â
Go past the mosque and make a U - turn .
2 . The government blocks all web sites that it deems â€œoffensiveâ€ to the â€œreligious , moral , and cultural valuesâ€ of the UAE .
Â
Thatâ€™s hard to swallow for a freedom loving American , but I get it .
Â
I do not understand , however , why all VOIP access and related web sites are blocked .
Â
I guess the government also takes offense to people inexpensively contacting their families back home .
Â
Youâ€ ™re welcome to call using the analog service provided by the government - owned telephone monopoly , but it will cost you a whole lot more .
Â
So much so , in fact , your frequency of calls will be greatly diminished if you can afford them at all .
Â
The government says VOIP is blocked for security reasons , yet even the residents of communist China and North Korea have access to these inexpensive calls .
Â 3 . It is really hot outside .
Â Not Florida in July hot ;
Hot as if you were locked in a car in Florida in July with sufficient humidity to make it feel as though you are drowning .
Â
Hot as in 120 degrees with nearly 100 % humidity .
Â
Do not look to the wind for relief .
Â
This is the equivalent of pointing a hairdryer on full blast directly at your face .
Â
Pour fine moon dust - like sand over your head as you do this and you get the picture .
4 . There are too few trees , plants , and grass â€ “ or living things aside from us crazy humans , for that matter .
Â
Ever see a bird pant ? Â I have .Â
In my opinion , human beings were not meant to live in such a place .
Â
If we were , there would be sufficient water and shade .
Â
The only greenery around are the roadside gardens planted by the government , who waters the hell out of them in the middle of the day .
Â
Thanks a lot !
Â
Didnâ€™t you say we should cut down on our water consumption because you are unable to keep up with the demand ?
Â
I have an idea : letâ€™s all move someplace where itâ€™s not 120 degrees outside .
5 . This country prides itself so much on its glitz and glamour that it put a picture of its 7 - star hotel on the license plate .
Yet , the public toilets in the king - of - bling Gold Souk district are holes in the ground with no toilet paper or soap .
Â
Hoses to rinse your nether regions , however , are provided .
Â
This results in a mass of water on the floor that you must stand in to pee .
Â
Try squatting without touching anything and keeping your pants from touching anything either .
Â
Oh yeah .
Â Itâ€™s 120 degrees in there too .
6 . This country encourages businesses to hire people from other poor countries to come here and work .
Â
They have them sign contracts that are a decade long and then take their passports .
Â
Even though taking passports is supposedly illegal , the government knows it happens and does nothing to enforce the law .
These poor people are promised a certain pay , but the companies neglect to tell them they will be deducting their cost of living from their paychecks , leaving them virtually penniless â€ “ that is , if they choose to pay them .
Â
Companies hold back paychecks for months at a time .
Â
When the workers strike as a result , they are jailed .
Â
Protesting is illegal , you see ( apparently this law IS enforced ) .
These people will never make enough to buy a ticket home and even if they do , they do not have their passports .
Â
They live crammed in portables with tons of others , in highly unsanitary conditions .
Â
The kicker : they are building hotels that cost more to stay in for one night than they will make in an entire year .
Â
Things are so bad that a number of laborers are willing to throw themselves in front of cars because their death would bring their family affluence in the form of diya , blood money paid to the victimâ€™s family as mandated by the government .
7 . Things are not cheaper here .
Â
Iâ€™m sick of people saying that .
Â
I read the letters to the editor page of the paper and people say to those who complain about the cost of living rising here , â€ œWell , itâ€™s cheaper than your home country or you wouldnâ€™t be here .
â€ Â Â Â The only thing cheaper here is labor .
Â
Yes , you can have a maid â€ “ but a bag of washed lettuceÂ will cost you almost $ 10 .
8 . There are traffic cameras everywhere .
Â I consider this cheating .
Â
Where are the damn cops ?
Â
I drove around this city for weeks before I ever even saw a cop . Â
Trust me , they need traffic cops here .
Â
People drive like idiots .
Itâ€™s perfectly okay to turn left from the far right lane , but speeding even just a couple of kilometers over will get you fined .
Â
These cameras are placed strategically as you come down hills , or just as the speed limit changes .
Â
Before you know itâ€ ¦BAM !Â Fined .
Â
Forget to pay the bill and your car will be impounded ..
9 . The clothing some of these women wear makes no sense to me .
Â
I understand that as part of your religion you are required to dress in a particular way , but a black robe over your jeans and turtleneck and cover your head when it is 120 degrees outside ?
Â
In the gym some women wear five layers of clothingâ€ ¦sweatpants and t- shits over sweaters with headscarves .
Â
Yet the menâ€™s clothing makes absolute sense : white , airy , and nothing underneath but their skivvies .
10 . People stare at you .
Â I am sick of being stared at .
Â
Iâ€™m stared at by men who have never seen a fair - skinned blue - eyed woman before , or who have and think we are all prostitutes so itâ€™s okay to stare .
Â
They stare at me when I am fully covered or with my husband , and even follow me around .
Â
Itâ€™s beyond creepy and has brought me to tears on more than one occasion .
Â
The staring is not limited to men , either .
Â
Iâ€™m stared at angrily by female prostitutes who think I am running in on their territory by having a few drinks with my husband at the bar .
11 . Prostitutes ?Â
Oh hell yes , there are prostitutes .
Â
Tons of them .Â
So , let me get this straight , I canâ€™t look at a naked picture of a person on the Internet in the privacy of my home , but it is okay to go out in public and buy a few for the night ?
12 . Alcohol can only be sold in hotels and a handful of private clubs .
Â
A person must own a liquor license to consume in the privacy of their own home .
Â
To obtain a liquor license you must get signed approval from your boss , prove a certain level of salary that determines how much you are allowed to buy , and then submit several mug shots ( aka passport photos ) for approval .
Â
Pay the fee and the additional 30 % tax on every purchase and you may drink at home .
Â
Then again , you can just pick up a few bottles in the airport duty free on your way in to the country , but two is the max .
Â
Why not just drive out to Ajman where itâ€™s a free - for - all and load up the SUV ? Â
Itâ€™s easy enough , but crossing the Emirates with alcohol is illegal â€ “ particularly in the dry emirate of Sharjah , which just happens to lie between Dubai and Ajman . Â
Go figure .
13 .
Not only do you have to get your bossâ€™s approval to obtain a liquor license , but you must also get the companyâ€™s approval to rent property , have a telephone , or get satellite TV .
14 . Back to the craziness on the roads :
If I see one more kid standing up and waving to me out the back window while flying down the road at 160 kphâ€ ¦whatever happened to seatbelts ?
15 . When is the weekend again ? Â
Let me get this straight : the weekend used to be Thursday and Friday , but no one took off all of Thursday , just a half day really .
Â
Now the government says Friday and Saturday are the weekend , but some people only take off Friday , others still take a half day on Thursday , but some might just take a half day on Saturday instead .
Â
Anyway you slice it , Sundays are workdays and little business can be accomplished Thursday through Saturday .
16 .
There are few satellite television operators : .Â
The movie channels play movies that are old and outdated .
Â
Many of them went straight to video back in the States .
Â
Every sitcom that failed in the US has been purchased and is played here .
Â
Old episodes of Knight Rider are advertised like it is the coolest thing since sliced bread .
Â
The TV commercials areÂ repeated so often that I am determined NOT to buy anything I see advertised on television here just for thee principle of it .
Â
When I say repeated often , I mean every commercial break – sometimes more than once .
17 .
The roads are horribly designed .
Â
Driving ten minutes out of the way to make a U - turn is not uncommon .
Â
People are not able to give directions most of the time ( remember reason # 1 ) , and the maps are little help because most have few road names on them , if any .
Â
Where is interchange four ?
Â
You just have to hope you got on the freeway in the right place and start counting because they are not numbered .
Â
Miss it and youâ€™ll likely end up on the other side of town before you are able to turn around and go back .
18 . Taxi drivers are dangerous and smell .
Taxi drivers work very hard here to earn a living because travel by taxi is still relatively inexpensive , even though the cost of living is not ( see reason # 7 ) .
Â
Because of this you may have a driver who has had little sleep or the opportunity to shower for several days .
Â
Many of these drivers have just as much difficulty finding their way around as you do , but add to this a third - world country driving style and extreme exhaustion and , well , remember to buckle up for safety .
19 . Speeding is an Emirati sport and Emirates Road is just an extension of the Dubai Autodrome .
Â
I know I keep mentioning the roads , but really , much of this cityâ€™s issues are encompassed by the erratic and irrational behavior displayed on its streets .
Â
Visions of flashing lights on even flashier , limo - tinted SUVs haunt me as I merge on to the highway .
Â
Local nationals are somehow able to get the sun-protecting dark window tint denied to us lowly expats and use it to hide their faces as they tailgate you incessantly at unbelievably high speeds , their lights flickering on and off and horn blaring repeatedly .
Â
It doesnâ€™t matter that you canâ€™t get over , or if doing so would be particularly dangerous , they will run you off the road to get in front of you .
Â
Donâ€™t even think about giving someone the finger ; the offense could land you in jail .
Â
Tailgating is , unbelievably , legal .
20 . Dubai is far from environmentally friendly .
Â
Ever wonder how much damage those manmade islands are doing to the delicate ocean ecosystem ?
Â
Coral reefs , sea grasses , and oyster beds that were once part of protected marine lands lie choked under a barrage of dredged up sea sand .
Â
Consider the waste that occurs from erecting buildings on top of these sand monsters and from the people that occupy them coupled with the lack of an effective recycling program and you have an environmental disaster on your hands .
Â
Add to this more gas guzzling SUVs than fuel - efficient cars on the road and the need for 24 - hour powerful air - conditioning and its evident that the environment is not high on the priority list of the UAE .
So while Iâ€™m sure there are benefits to living in Dubai , tax breaks , multi-cultural environments , and beautiful buildings aside , reconsider your plans to move here if any of the above mentioned reasons strikes a chord within you .
Â Dubai is a city caught in an identity crisis .
Â
Struggling somewhere between its desire to be a playground for the rich and its adherence to traditional Islamic roots , rests a city that lacks sufficient infrastructure to support its delusions of grandeur .
Â
Visit if you must , but leave quickly before you are sucked into its calamitous void .

Adobe has apparently gone against old Jobsy 's wishes , and it 's planning a Flash player made all special for the iPhone ( ala Windows Mobile ) despite Apple 's concerns that the technology -- in its current incarnation , anyway -- is n't cut out for mobile duty .
During a conference call today , Chief Executive Shantanu Narayen said , " We believe Flash is synonymous with the Internet experience , and we are committed to bringing Flash to the iPhone , " adding , " We have evaluated ( the software developer tools ) and we think we can develop an iPhone Flash player ourselves . "
We would n't be surprised if Adobe were to be given a pass on all those pesky SDK rules that would likely prevent a proper browser - based Flash component to be coded for the device , though those Apple dudes can be real sticklers for rules .
Jack Thompson Recommended for 10 - year Disbarment , Walks Out of Disciplinary Hearing
According to Kotaku , Thompson left the courtroom after saying that presiding Judge Dava Tunis did not have the authority to hear his case , and filed a 4,500 word objection to the hearing prior to his departure .
The hearing continued without Thompson , after which the Florida Bar recommended enhanced disbarment .
Thompson was found guilty of 27 counts of misconduct last month for his participation in several video game - related cases .
As per the disciplinary process , Judge Tunis ' recommendations for sanctions are due to the Florida Supreme Court by September 2nd .
Thompson 's objection claims , among other things , that Judge Tunis is without legal authority to serve due to a failure to comply with Florida 's loyalty oath statute .
Thompson also suggests that the judge has repeatedly attempted to smear and slander him , closing his objection with a quote from the Bible and the following remarks :
" By perseverance and by God 's grace , I have fashioned a legal millstone that I will place around your neck and the neck of The Bar .
Do n't blame me , Referee Tunis , when you feel the water rising . "
Thompson 's almost comically massive 4,500 word objection , viewable here , further states that the attorney was " ahead of the curve " with Grand Theft Auto and other violent games , and adds that it was his influence that made violent games an issue in the current U.S. Presidential race .
In the west of Scotland , in the towns and villages surrounding Glasgow , there is a delicacy available in some of the more discerning fast - food outlets .
It ’s called the Munchy Box ( sometimes just Munch Box ) and it ’s a sight to behold .
The one I bought for this article is a regular - sized one , in a 10 ″ pizza box for about a fiver , but they can come in 12 ″ or beyond for eight quid and up .
Upon opening your Jock Monsieur , you will see a layer of Doner Kebab meat on top of a Naan Bread , maybe with some Glasgow Salad ( chips ) poking out from underneath .
The wonders that await !
Once the top layer has been removed , you can clearly see the two tubs of Sauce , the Glasgow Salad on the left and the Crappy Salad in the middle with the Onion Rings , Pakora and Chicken Tikka all huddled together for warmth on the right .
As a serving suggestion , I ’ve laid it out with the crappy salad atop the chips , a piece of chicken tikka balanced on top of the salads , an onion ring surrounding a piece of pakora , a wall of doner meat served with a feuille of naan with a choice of two sauces .
Sparkling Italian rosé replaced the traditional Irn Bru , but purists be damned !
Or , alternatively , you could just shovel half down your Tennents - lined gullet whilst dropping the other half ( crappy salad deliberately , the rest less so ) on the pavement .
Next time , I may brave the hallowed Pizza Crunch Supper for your delection .
With a half - pizza deep fried in chip - shop batter and piled on a wodge of chips , it truly is the champion of the artery - hardeners .

New research shows increased temperatures and carbon dioxide levels are a threat to the Australian national icon , the koala .
Professor Ian Hume , Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science , and his students from the University of Sydney have been researching the effects of CO 2 increases and temperature rises on eucalypts .
Professor Hume 's group have shown in the laboratory that increases in CO 2 affect the level of nutrients and ' anti- nutrients ' ( things that are either toxic or interfere with the digestion of nutrients ) in eucalypt leaves .
Anti-nutrients in eucalypts are built from carbon and an increase in carbon dioxide levels will favour the production of anti-nutrients over nutrients .
Koalas are fussy about the species of eucalypts that they eat as different species contain different ratios of nutrients to anti-nutrients .
Some eucalypt species may have high protein content , but anti-nutrients such as tannins bind the protein so it can't be used by the koala .
He said : ' If there is a significant rise in CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere , which we 're already seeing , that 's going to push the ratio of nutrients to anti-nutrients even lower by increasing the concentration of these carbon - based anti-nutrients .
' What currently may be good koala habitat may well become , over a period of not so many years at the rate that CO 2 concentrations are rising , very marginal habitat ...

' I'm sure we 'll see koalas disappearing from their current range even though we do n't see any change in tree species or structure of the forests . '
When asked how long it would take for koalas to be affected , he said : ' I would 've thought a few years ago when we first did these experiments that you might see something in a hundred years , but at the rate at which things are going I suspect that we might see changes within our lifetimes . '
Changes in eucalypt nutrient content may force koalas to travel in search of more nutrient - rich species .
With habitats fragmented by roads and agriculture , more koalas will travel by land , which increases their risk of being hit by vehicles or eaten by predators .
Higher temperatures could also affect eucalypt species .
Some are so sensitive to temperature that even a one degree shift in mean annual temperature will affect them .
These sensitive species could then be outcompeted by others which are less sensitive to temperature .
If these less temperature sensitive species are n't suitable for koala feed then '... we 're not seeing anything in terms of the forest disappearing , but in terms of nutritional habitat , it has disappeared . '
When asked if koalas could adapt to changes in nutrient levels , he said : ' I do n't think they 've got enough time to do that , nowhere near enough time to do that . '
Professor Hume 's group have been studying the four marsupials that eat eucalypt foliage with the koala being the most highly specialised .
The others are the greater glider , common ringtail possum , and common brushtail possum .
By comparing the responses all four species make to dietary changes , a larger picture of the state of the environmental system can be formed .
This research was presented at the Academy of Science 's peak event , Science at the Shine Dome , April 24 , 2008 .
Followup to : Identity Is n't In Specific Atoms
It is widely said that some primitive tribe or other once feared that photographs could steal their souls .
Ha ha !
How embarrassing .
Silly tribespeople .
I shall now present three imaginary conversations along such lines — the common theme being frustration .
The first conversation :
Foolishly leaving the world of air - conditioning , you traveled to the Godforsaken Outback , and of course , got lost in the woods .
A more primitive tribe than yours , the Hu'wha , saved your butt .
Although the Hu'wha have told you how to reach an outpost of Internet access , that is , civilization , you 've stayed with them a while longer ; you 've become their friend , and they yours .
One custom of the Hu'wha does seem strange to you , coming as you do from a more civilized culture :
They do n't hold with lies , even small ones .
They consider a lie as an infringement upon the soul of the listener .
They have a saying , " It is better to die than to be lied to . "
Though this is a very strange and primitive custom , you have come to respect it .
Late one night , the shaman calls you to his tent .
His face is grave .
" I have heard the most disturbing news , " he says , " from the Tribe That Lives Across The Water .
They say that your people , the People of the Net , have a most terrible custom : they paint images of others , and thereby steal their souls , for a person cannot be in two places at once .
It is even said that you have weapons called ' cameras ' , for doing this automatically ; and that the cameras of your folk can be very small , or disguised as other things . "
" Um , " you say , " I think you may be laboring under certain basic misconceptions .
Cameras are not weapons ; they make images , but they do n't steal souls . "
The grey - bearded shaman smiles , and shakes his head .
" Young fellow , I am the shaman of the Hu'wha , and I hold the tradition passed down from my father through many generations ; the true and original wisdom granted by the gods to the first shaman .
I think I know what steals a soul and what does not , young fellow !
Even to you it should be obvious . "
And you think : Foolish mortal , how little you understand the power of Science .
But this is beyond the conception of this man who thinks himself above you , and so you say nothing .
" I understand , " the shaman says , " that your people may be so utterly ignorant of magic that they do n't realize their cameras are dangerous .
But that makes it all the more urgent that I ask you , Net-user , upon your honor :
Have you by any means whatever , in your time among us , whether yourself , or by any device , produced an image of anyone here ?
If you have , we will do no violence to you — for I know there is no malice in you — but you will no longer be welcome among us . "
You pause .
The Hu'wha set great store on the literal truth of words , as well as their intent .
And though you have no camera or paintbrushes , the answer to the question just asked , is literally yes .
Your eyes , retina , and optic nerve are constantly painting images in your visual cortex .
" I have n't made any pictures the way you mean it , " you say .
The shaman frowns .
" I was looking for a simple No. Why the hesitation ? "
Oh , dear .
" The knowledge of my own people , the Net - folk , is not like your own knowledge , " you say , " and you asked a ... deeper question than you know , according to the beliefs of my own people . "
" This is a very simple matter , " the shaman says sharply , " and it has to do with what you have done .
Have you made any pictures , or not ? "
" I 've painted no picture , and used no camera . "
" Have you caused a picture to be made by any other means ? " demands the shaman .
Dammit .
" Not the way you mean it .
I 've done nothing that the Hu'wha do not also do . "
" Explain yourself ! "
You sigh .
" It is a teaching of my people , which you are welcome to believe or not as it suits you , that pictures are constantly being created of all of us , all the time . "
" What ? " says the shaman .
" When you look at someone , " you explain , " or even when an animal looks at you , that creates an image on the inside of the skull ... that is how you see .
Indeed , it is what you see — everything you see is a picture your eyes create . "
" That 's nonsense , " says the shaman .
" You 're right there !
I 'm seeing you , not an image of you !
Now I ask you again , on your honor :
Do we Hu'wha still have our souls since you came among us , or not ? "
Oh , bloody hell .
" It is a teaching of my people , " you say , " that what you call a ' soul ' is ... a confused idea . "
" You are being evasive , " says the shaman sternly .
" The soul is not complicated , and it would be very hard to mistake a soul for something else , like a shoe or something .
Our souls are breathed into us by Great Ghu at birth , and stays with us our whole lives , unless someone steals it ; and if no one has photographed us , our souls go to the Happy Gaming Room when we die .
Now I ask you again :
Do I have my soul , or not ?
Give me the truth ! "
" The truth , " you say , " is that the way my people see the world is so different from yours , that you can't even imagine what I think is the truth .
I 've painted no pictures , taken no photographs ; all I 've done is look at you , and nothing happens when I look at you , that does n't happen when anyone else looks at you .
But you are being constantly photographed , all the time , and you never had any soul to begin with : this is the truth . "
" Horse output , " says the shaman .
" Go away ; we never want to see you again . "
The second conversation :
John Smith still looked a little pale .
This was quite understandable .
Going to a pleasant dinner with your family , having a sudden heart attack , riding to the hospital by ambulance , dying , being cryonically suspended by Alcor , spending decades in liquid nitrogen , and then awakening , all in the span of less than 24 subjective hours , will put a fair amount of stress on anyone .
" Look , " said John , " I accept that there are things you 're not allowed to tell me -"
" Not right away , " you say .
" We 've found that certain pieces of information are best presented in a particular order . "
John nods .
" Fine , but I want to be very clear that I do n't want to be told any comforting lies .
Not for the sake of my ' psychological health ' , and not for anything .
If you can't tell me , just say nothing .
Please . "
You raise your hand to your chest , two fingers out and the others folded .
" That , I can promise : I can not tell you everything , but what I say to you will be true .
In the name of Richard Feynman , who is dead but not forgotten . "
John is giving you a very strange look .
" How long did you say I was suspended ? "
" Thirty - five years , " you say .
" I was thinking , " said John , " that things surely would n't have changed all that much in thirty - five years . "
You say nothing , thus keeping your promise .
" But if things have changed that much , " John says , " I want to know something .
Have I been uploaded ? "
You frown .
" Uploaded ?
I 'm sorry , I do n't understand .
The word ' upload ' used to apply to computer files , right ? "
" I mean , " says John , " have I been turned into a program ?
An algorithm somewhere ? "
Huh ?
" Turned into an algorithm ?
What were you before , a constant integer ? "
" Aargh , " says John .
" Okay , yes , I 'm a program , you 're a program .
Every human in the history of humanity has been a program running on their brain .
I understand that .
What I want to know is whether me , this John Smith , the one talking to you right now , is a program on the same hardware as the John Smith who got cryonically suspended . "
You pause .
" What do you mean , ' same hardware ' ? "
John starts to look worried .
" I was hoping for a simple ' Yes ' , there .
Am I made of the same atoms as before , or not ? "
Oh , dear .
" I think you may be laboring under certain basic misconceptions , " you say .
" I understand , " John said , " that your people may have the cultural belief that uploading preserves personal identity — that a human is memories and personality , not particular atoms .
But I happen to believe that my identity is bound up with the atoms that make me .
It 's not as if there 's an experiment you can do to prove that I 'm wrong , so my belief is just as valid as yours . "
Foolish child , you think , how little you understand the power of Science .
" You asked a deeper question than you know , " you say , " and the world does not work the way you think it does .
An atom is ... not what you imagine . "
" Look , " John says sharply , " I 'm not asking you about this time 's theories of personal identity , or your beliefs about consciousness — that 's all outside the realm of third - party scientific investigation anyway .
I 'm asking you a simple question that is experimentally testable .
Okay , you found something new underneath the quarks .
That 's not surprising .
I 'm asking , whatever stuff I am made of , is it the same stuff as before ?
Yes or no ? "
The third conversation :
Your question is itself confused .
Whatever is , is real .
" Look , " Eliezer said , " I know I 'm not being misunderstood , so I 'm not going to try and phrase this the elaborately correct way :
Is this thing that I 'm holding an old - fashioned banana , or does it only have the appearance of a banana ? "
You wish to know if the accustomed state of affairs still holds .
In which it merely appears that there is a banana in your hand , but actually , there is something very different behind the appearance : a configuration of particles , held together by electromagnetic fields and other laws that humans took centuries to discover .
" That 's right .
I want to know if the lower levels of organization underlying the banana have a substantially different structure than before , and whether the causal relation between that structure and my subjective experience has changed in style . "
Well then .
Rest assured that you are not holding the mere appearance of a banana .
There really is a banana there , not just a collection of atoms .
There was a long pause .
" WHAT ? "
Or perhaps that was only a joke .
Let it stand that the place in which you find yourself is at least as real as anywhere you ever thought you were , and the things you see are even less illusionary than your subjective experiences of them .
" Oh , come on !
I 'm not some hunter - gatherer worried about a photographer stealing his soul !
If I 'm running on a computer somewhere , and this is a virtual environment , that 's fine !
I was just curious , that 's all . "
Some of what you believe is true , and some of what you believe is false : this may also be said of the hunter - gatherer .
But there is a true difference between yourself and the hunter - gatherer , which is this :
You have a concept of what it means for a fundamental assumption to be mistaken .
The hunter - gatherer has no experience with other cultures that believe differently , no history that tells of past scientific revolutions .
But you know what is meant , whether or not you accept it , you understand the assertion itself :
Some of your fundamental assumptions are mistaken .

Teatro del Agua : The Seawater Greenhouse " That Can Change the World "
June 9th , 2008 by Joe Mohr
Seawater Greenhouse inventor Charles Paton teams with the Eden Project and Grimshaw Architects to create the Teatro del Agua .
I last posted on the Seawater Greenhouse in February .
After writing that post I felt hopeful that this type of desalination plant would catch on , yet pessimistic that , based on the pictures I saw , it would neither reach the necessary scale to create enough clean water nor attract the type of investors needed to take this plant to the next level .
I ’m very happy to find out that I was wrong .
I researched the Seawater Greenhouse again to look for breaking news because I decided back in February that I needed to post on this on a regular basis to spread the word on the technology .
By the looks of the Seawater Greenhouse Inventor Charles Paton ’s latest project , my effort will not be needed .
Just as the Prius will replace the Hummer on our nation ’s roads , the Teatro del Agua shall replace the energy intensive desalination plants of old , worldwide .
All the while supplying said world with an endless supply of water and creating an outdoor venue for theatrical performances .
Afterall , you ca n’t spell WATER without A - R - T. ( below average pun–my apologies )
The Teatro del Agua requires no fuel to create its massive amounts of freshwater .
It will instead rely on the sea , sun , and wind to create the energy needed to create the water .
The technology is quite amazing .
Watch for yourself on this YouTube video .
The only thing left to report is exactly how much water will be created –the video states “ enough for a city ” ( New York or Cincinnati ? ) .
The planet has reached a tipping point and I believe Paton when he claims this project has the potential to “ change the world ” , and that “ solutions to water also solve the problems of the planet ” .

I would n’t want to alarm anyone , but it appears that Karl Rove is n’t an especially honest person .
Yes , this may come as a surprise to , well , maybe somebody out there , but his latest Wall Street Journal column helps drive the point home .
For example , Rove argued at length that Democrats are out of touch with public opinion when it comes to the war in Iraq .
Seriously .
One out of five is not a majority .
Democrats should keep that simple fact of political life in mind as they pursue the White House .
For a party whose presidential candidates pledge they ’ll remove U.S. troops from Iraq immediately upon taking office — without regard to conditions on the ground or the consequences to America ’s security — a late February Gallup Poll was bad news .
The Obama / Clinton vow to pull out of Iraq immediately appears to be the position of less than one - fifth of the voters .
Only 18 % of those surveyed by Gallup agreed U.S. troops should be withdrawn “ on a timetable as soon as possible . ”
And only 20 % felt the surge was making things worse in Iraq .
Twice as many respondents felt the surge was making conditions better . [… ]
Just a year ago it was almost universally accepted that Iraq would wreck the GOP chances in November .
Now the issue may pose a threat to the Democratic efforts to gain power .
For while the American people are acknowledging the positive impact of the surge , Democratic leaders are not .
So , to summarize , Karl Rove — the alleged strategic genius of the Republican Party — believes the Dems ’ withdrawal plans are unpopular with the public , while the Bush administration policy is gaining favor .
It ’s a pretty silly argument for a top former White House aide to make in print , but as long as Rove is pushing the line , and Rove is going to be a major media player , we might as well go to the trouble of highlighting how wrong he is .
The Rove argument is pretty straightforward : Dems support withdrawal ; the public in general does not .
Dems think the war will help the party in the elections , but it ’s more likely to hurt .
Got it .
The problem is equally straightforward : Rove has engaged in some poll cherry - picking , overlooking the overwhelming data that contradicts his odd worldview .
Consider some of the most recent numbers that Rove prefers to pretend does n’t exist .
* CBS News : “ Do you approve or disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling the situation with Iraq ? ” 65 % disapprove , 30 % approve
* CNN : “ If you had to choose , would you rather see the next president keep the same number of troops in Iraq that are currently stationed there , or would you rather see the next president remove most U.S. troops in Iraq within a few months of taking office ? ” 61 % remove , 33 % keep the same number
* Washington Post / ABC
News : “ Which political party , the Democrats or the Republicans , do you trust to do a better job handling the situation in Iraq ? ” 48 % Democrats , 34 % Republicans
Now , I will gladly concede that popular opinion with regards to the war is complicated .
For example , we ’ve seen , in a variety of instances , polls showing Americans wanting a withdrawal within a year .
Twelve months later , they once again say they want withdrawal within a year .
It makes reading the tea leaves a little tricky .
But for Rove to argue that Dems are at odds with the public ( and , implicitly , that Republicans are in line with popular opinion ) is just foolish .
We can debate the severity of the White House ’s fiasco and what might happen if we began implementing a sensible policy for a change , but to argue insist that Democratic proposals are out of step with voters simply is n’t supported by reality .
In fact , it ’s far more likely that the opposite is true — Dems ’ poll numbers began falling last year when voters thought the majority party was n’t doing enough to challenge Bush on the war .
" There was not an atom of hate on either side that day ;
and yet , on our side , not for a moment was the will to war
and the will to beat them relaxed "
Bruce Bairnsfather , British soldier and author of " Old Bill " cartoons
" one human episode amid all the atrocities
which have stained the memory of the war "
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , publishing one year later
The Christmas Truce of 1914 is one of the great legends of the First World War , spawning many books on the subject and at least one song ( " Christmas in the Trenches " ) .
Although some have dismissed it as mere myth , it undoubtably did happen - the evidence , both literary and photographic , is unquestionable .
However , many people are unaware as to the exact nature of the truce .
Where along the line did the truce take place , and where did it not ?
How long did it last ?
Why did it happen where it did , and why not where it did n't ?
These questions must be answered to provide an accurate overview of this remarkable event .
Other Examples
1914 was by no means the first example of soldiers in conflicts throughout history taking a break and " fraternising " with the enemy .
For example , in the Peninsular campaign , part of the Napoleonic Wars , there have been lulls in the fighting reported between British and French troops , and similiar ones in the Crimean War between Russians and Brits , and on occasion the French as well .
Later there are examples from the American Civil War and , as late as 1900 , the Boer War .
However , all of these must be taken in context .
The majority of these temporary respites from war ( such as a football match between troops in South Africa during the Boer War ) only occurred during talks or conferences that were happening anyway .
Also , only nationalities willing to participate in such truces would do so .
Spanish forces in the Peninsular War , for example , would not even contemplate fraternising with the hated French invaders .
Later , in 1914 , this would also be an issue , as generally ( although not in all cases , as some French and Belgians also took part ) only German forces a short distance away from British lines would try to instigate a short peace .
Despite this , these examples show that close proximity to enemy forces for prolonged periods often led to such breaks , with soldiers swapping memoribilia and stories , or perhaps even playing cards together round the same fire .
So the Christmas Truce of 1914 was not a particularly unique occurrence in warfare ; but is certainly still the greatest example of a short - term truce in modern times .
Christmas Eve , 1914
Although for most of the day the routine was the same as for any other of this cold winter , the British forces opposite certain parts of the German frontline began to notice changes when night began to fall .
It was a German tradition to erect christmas trees , adorned with lit candles , and these began to appear in the trenches .
At first , perhaps unsuprisingly , these slightly confused the British lookouts and sentries , and the sightings were reported back to Staff headquarters .
Although the top brass were suspicious , orders were given to merely observe and to not open fire .
Then the sound of carols being sung in German drifted across No Man 's Land ; the British promptly responded with carols of their own .
Hostile feeling was rapidly eroding , and before long greetings were being called across from and towards either side ; English - speaking Germans called to " Tommy " , and the British to " Fritz " .
In some areas parties were invited across to the other side , to negotiate an armistice over the Christmas period or perhaps just swap cigars and brandy .
Contrary to popular belief , it was not just the common soldier who participated , but NCOs and officers alike .
Rumours of such meetings between the sides spread up and down the lines , and many agreements to allow each side to bury its dead sprang up .
It was during this duty that soldiers from both sides inevitably came into contact , with the subsequent swapping of letters etc .
The infamous football match occurred between the English Bedfordshire Regiment and unknown German troops - the Germans reportedly won the game 3 - 2 .
The truce lasted for different lengths of time , in some places only until Christmas Day was over , in others as long as New Year .
Reaction
The Allied governments and High Command , in particular the French , reacted with indignation .
They were not at all happy that the " fraternisation " had taken place , and had gone to some lengths to avoid it beforehand .
For example , some senior officers had predicted a lull in hostilities over Christmas , and had therefore placed their troops on high alert .
Where this failed , immediately after fighting had resumed orders were issued so that it would not recur , and some local commanders were reprimanded for allowing it .
For example , the following is part of an order that was issued to the British II Corps ( then under Sir Horace Smith - Dorrien ) :
" Friendly intercourse with the enemy , unofficial armistices ( e.g. ' we wo n't fire if you do n't ' etc. ) and the exchange of tobacco and other comforts , however tempting and occasionally amusing they may be , are absolutely prohibited . "
In fact , the Roman Catholic Church had called for a halt to the fighting over Christmas some time in advance .
Although the German government indicated that they might agree , the Allies for some reason would not , so the war was to go on over Christmas .
Afterwards , an inquiry sought to discover whether it was pre-meditated or not ; the investigation concluded that it was a truly spontaneous event , that occurred in some places yet in many others did not .
The event was also given quite a lot of publicity in both Germany and Britain , with articles about it appearing in newspapers throughout January 1915 .
Letters from front - line soldiers were published , as were photographs of the actual event showing troops from both sides side by side .
The reaction amongst the soldiers themselves was one of astonishment ; they could barely believe it happened .
The war was never forgotten , however , and the opportunity for both sides to observe the enemy trenches from up close was not lost .
Valuable information was gathered that day .
Never Again
The negative reaction from the top commanders of the armies facing each other across No Man's Land towards the truce meant that it was not to be repeated the next year .
Artillery bombardments were increased over the period in 1915 , and in any case by then feelings of goodwill towards the enemy were largely forgotten , as the war dragged on and casualties mounted .
On the other hand , short truces still ocurred , on occasion , for the purpose of burying the dead .
Ernst Junger , at the time a German Lieutenant , describes the scene in his part of the line on the 11th of December 1915 :
" I could n't believe the sight that met my eyes .
The battlefield ... was now animated as a fairground .
The occupants of both trenches had emerged ... already a lively exchange of schnapps , cigarettes , uniform buttons and other items had commenced ... suddenly a shot rang out that laid one of our men dead in the mire , whereupon both sides quickly scuttled back into their trenches . "
Christmas was not to be a happy occasion in his sector that year .
The Christmas spirit was not much in evidence , as Junger recalls :
" We spent Christmas Eve in the line , and , standing in the mud , sang hymns , to which the British responded with machine - gun fire .
On Christmas Day , we lost one man to a ricochet in the head .
Immediately afterwards , the British attempted a friendly gesture by hauling a Christmas tree up on their traverse , but our angry troops quickly shot it down again , to which Tommy replied with rifle - grenades .
It was all in all a less than merry Christmas . "
Despite the fact that it was a one - off , the Christmas Truce of 1914 possesses a human element that has made it so attractive down the years .
It is what makes it such a great Christmas story , that in the midst of the possibly the most horrific conflict to that point in history such a thing could happen .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Even before debate began on Monday on the first comprehensive climate change bill to reach the U.S. Senate floor , the White House said President George W. Bush would veto it in its current form .
Bush himself slammed the bill , saying it would cost the U.S. economy $ 6 trillion .
His estimate drew quick denials from those who support the legislation , including Sen. Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat and longtime environmentalist .
The Bush administration has consistently opposed economy - wide measures to limit climate - warming emissions of carbon dioxide .
The United States is alone among major developed countries in rejecting the carbon - capping Kyoto Protocol , which sets more stringent targets than the bill headed for Senate debate .
“ I urge the Congress to be very careful about running up enormous costs for future generations of Americans , ” Bush said at a White House meeting on the economy and taxes .
“ We ’ll work with the Congress , but the idea of a huge spending bill fueled by tax increases is n’t the right way to proceed . ”
He said the bill , known as the Lieberman - Warner Climate Security Act and set for its first debate in the Senate late on Monday , “ would impose roughly $ 6 trillion of new costs on the American economy . ”
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Bush would veto the bill if it arrived on his desk as currently drafted , but added , “ It ’s very unlikely to pass the Senate anyway . ”
Most Capitol
Hill observers acknowledge the bill is highly unlikely to become law before Bush leaves the White House in January .
FENCE -SITTERS IN THE SENATE
The number of uncommitted senators is impressive , said Jeremy Symons of the National Wildlife Federation .

“ The fence is so crowded you can hear it creaking , ” Symons said of the fence - sitters on global warming legislation .
Some estimates have put the number of uncommitted senators at up to 20 -- one - fifth of the 100 - member Senate .
The bill ’s supporters maintain that the legislation ’s cap - and - trade provisions would create jobs and that the cost of doing nothing about climate change justifies action now .
Carbon dioxide , which is emitted by fossil - fueled vehicles and coal - fired power plants as well as from natural sources , is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
Boxer , who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and who has shepherded this legislation to the Senate floor , offered a blistering response to Bush ’s comments .
“ Just when we finally have a chance to get off of Big Oil and foreign oil , you can count on the Bush administration to fight us every step of the way , ” she said in a statement .
“ Where were they when gas prices went to 250 percent of what they were at the start of this administration ?
They did nothing . ”
The Lieberman - Warner bill contains tax relief for consumer energy costs , Boxer said .
“ As you can imagine , our opposition to this will be quite strong and we ’ll be making these points throughout the week , ” said Keith Hennessey , director of Bush ’s National Economic Council .
U.S. gross domestic product could be reduced by as much as 7 percent in the year 2050 and gasoline prices -- already at record highs in the United States -- could soar by as much as 53 cents a gallon by 2030 , he said .
The legislation the Senate will debate could cut total U.S. global warming emissions by 66 percent by 2050 , according to a summary of the measure .
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions would drop by about 2 percent per year between 2012 and 2050 , based on 2005 emission levels , under the measure .
The bill would cap carbon emissions from 86 percent of U.S. facilities , and emissions from those would be 19 percent below current levels by 2020 and 71 percent below current levels by 2050 , according to a summary of the bill ’s details released by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .

THE RETRIEVERS
Such cases are a relative rarity this decade .
In the last eight years , the Justice Department has brought roughly 15 obscenity cases that have not involved child pornography , compared with 75 during the Reagan and first Bush administrations , according to Jeffrey J. Douglas , chairman emeritus of the First Amendment Lawyers Association .
( There have been hundreds involving child pornography . )
Prosecutions at the state level have followed a similar arc .
The question of what constitutes obscenity relies on a three - part test established in a 1973 decision by the Supreme Court .
Essential to the test has been whether the material in question is patently offensive or appeals to a prurient interest in sex  definitions that are based on “ contemporary community standards . ”
Lawyers in obscenity cases have tried to demonstrate community standards by , for example , showing the range of sexually explicit magazines and movies available locally .
A better barometer , Mr. Douglas said , would be mail - order statistics , because they show what people consume in private .
But that information is hard to obtain .
“ All you had to go on is what was available for public consumption , and that was a very crude tool , ” Mr. Douglas said .
“ The prospect of having measurement of Internet traffic brings a more objective component than we ’ve ever seen before . ”
In a federal obscenity case heard this month , Mr. Douglas defended another Florida pornographer .
In the trial , Mr. Douglas set up a computer in the courtroom and did Internet searches for sexually explicit terms to show the jury that there were millions of Web pages discussing such material .
He then searched for other topics , like the University of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow , to demonstrate that there were not nearly as many related Web sites .
The jury was evidently not swayed , as his client was convicted on all counts .
The case Mr. Walters is defending takes the tactic to another level .
Rather than showing broad availability of sex- related Web sites , he is trying to show both accessibility and interest in the material within the jurisdiction of the First Circuit Court for Santa Rosa County , where the trial is taking place .
The search data he is using is available through a service called Google Trends ( trends.google.com ) .
It allows users to compare search trends in a given area , showing , for instance , that residents of Pensacola are more likely to search for sexual terms than some more wholesome ones .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The shine is off traditional inflation hedges like gold and inflation - indexed bonds as investors turn to mutual funds heavily exposed to commodity markets as well as to blue chip stocks with solid earnings .
The resurgence of inflation is sweeping through more than just the world ’s largest economies in U.S. , Europe , Asia , and has supplanted the housing collapse and credit crunch as the latest economic menace .
Already , investors have wasted no time in protecting their portfolios against rising prices .
The Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury Inflation - Protected Securities index has risen more than 13 percent for the year ended May 31 , compared with 6.9 percent for the Lehman Aggregate index , the leading barometer of all types of bonds .
While the rise in inflation has been driven by volatile fuel and energy prices , money managers are now expecting inflation to be higher and more persistent in the next several years , and are diversifying portfolios as part of a long - term strategy .
“ De-regulation , globalization and strong productivity growth helped central banks to keep inflation low over the past 20 years , ” Morgan Stanley ’s asset - allocation committee recently said in a June report .
Now , re-regulation and protectionism are making a comeback and globalization has turned inflationary while productivity growth has ebbed , they added .
COMMODITIES SEEN AS HAVEN
What to do in such an environment ?
Commodities are among investors ’ top choice as a hedge against inflation .
Because commodities prices usually rise when inflation is accelerating , as it has recently , they offer protection from the effects of inflation .
“ We still believe that commodities are in a secular bull market and it ’s likely that 5 years from here , people invested in commodities will probably be happy they did so , ” Mihir Worah , manager of the $ 15 billion Pimco CommodityRealReturn Strategy Fund , said in an interview .
The first leg of the commodities rally occurred between late 2001 and early 2003 for a 27 percent gain , while the next leg lasted from March 2003 to March 2005 for a gain of 41 percent .
The current rally began in August 2007 and still continues for a gain of an eye - popping 52 percent .
“ Each leg has been stronger than the preceding one , ” said Tom Sowanick , chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial LLC in Princeton , New Jersey , adding investors should seek commodities exposure as an insurance policy .
Aside from such commodities funds like Pimco ’s , there are exchange - traded notes exposed to the commodities market .
James Picerno , editor of The Capital Spectator , a widely followed markets blog , said the iPath Dow Jones - AIG Commodity Index Total Return ( DJP ) offers exposure to broad commodities benchmarks like the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index .
The Dow Jones AIG benchmark caps the weights of individual commodities and commodity groups so nothing dominates the benchmark , Picerno said .
“ That makes it more appealing from a diversification standpoint and it massages any huge exposure to oil and energy , which has proven to be volatile , ” he said .
For instance , the Dow Jones AIG has a 34.55 percent cap on its assets in energy , mostly oil and natural gas , while the iPath Goldman Sachs Commodity Index Total Return Index has roughly 74 percent of its money in energy .
THE WARREN BUFFETT WAY
Christine Benz , director of personal finance at Morningstar in Chicago , said global investors and baby boomers , too , should n’t bypass stocks as an inflation hedge .
“ A company with a moat is going to have a realistic shot at passing off price increases on its customers because they ’ve got something that someone ca n’t get everywhere else , so customers are willing to pay a premium for it , ” she said .
Billionaire Warren Buffett swears by companies with “ moats , ” or unique advantages that offer protection from rapacious competitors .
Benz said funds with a big share of moats include the Jensen Portfolio JENSX.O , Dreyfus Appreciation DGAGX.O and the Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund VDIGX.O .
“ Those companies with moats are particularly advantageous if you are particularly concerned about inflation , ” she added .
Last fall , the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to Stryker , saying it had failed to take the steps needed to prevent squeaking and other problems .
Clouding things further , Stryker last year recalled ceramic hip parts made at its factory in Cork , Ireland , after determining that some did not meet its sterility specifications .
Stryker says that none of the problems underlying the recall or the warning letter from the F.D.A. reflect problems that cause squeaking , which it contends occurs in less than 1 percent of implants .
Whatever the actual frequency , some investigators who have looked at the problem say the squeaking seems to be associated with extreme flexing of the ceramic implants , but exactly how is unclear .
In X - rays , many of the squeaking hips appear to be perfectly aligned .
Nor is there a clear relationship between squeaking and hip pain or other conditions some patients say they have encountered , like the sensation that the hip disengages slightly when a patient walks .
Some patients squeak even they are walking normally , like Ms. O’Toole or Michael Mueller , a software executive in Scottsdale , Ariz .
Mr. Mueller is so frustrated with squeaks , pain and popping noises for which he blames his ceramic hip that he has displayed his problem on YouTube .
Image Susan OToole noticed an odd sound as she went up stairs .

Chester Higgins Jr./ The New York Times
While there have been no reported cases of serious mishaps , some surgeons fear that the ceramic material might shatter at some point , leaving a patient with so many inflammatory shards in the hip that a doctor could never find them all .
“ Catastrophic failure has been a concern in the past , with older ceramic components , ” said Dr. James M. Bried , a surgeon in Poway , Calif .
Ceramic materials have been used since the 1960s .
Dr. Bried , who implanted Mr. Mueller ’s hip last year , said he was concerned that squeaking might be “ a harbinger of something similar . ”
IndyMac Bank , a prolific mortgage specialist that helped fuel the housing boom , was seized Friday by federal regulators , in the third - largest bank failure in U.S. history .
IndyMac is the biggest mortgage lender to go under since a fall in housing prices and surge in defaults began rippling through the economy last year -- and it likely wo n't be the last .
Banking regulators are bracing for a slew of failures over the next year as analysts say housing prices have yet to bottom out .

BRATTLEBORO , Vt. ( AP ) –
The tone has changed in e-mails this Vermont town has been receiving on its proposal to issue warrants for the arrests of President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Now , more people are supporting the resolution .
Brattleboro ’s town offices have been flooded with 7,000 e-mails since its selectboard voted Jan. 25 to include the item on its Town Meeting Day agenda .
Some of the earliest messages received were so full of vitriol that town officials said they were worried for their safety .
Some writers called Brattleboro a bastion of “ liberal appeaser wimps ” and “ wackjobs ” for even considering the warrants .
Town Manager Barbara Sondag said any threatening emails are passed along to the police , although she said Tuesday that the nasty messages have subsided , replaced by ones supportive of the resolution .
Sondag ’s office is reviewing every e-mail received and the issue is taking up 60 percent of her workers ’ time .

My , is n’t a firm grasp on reality a wonderful thing ?
It seems unthinkable , but for the first time in human history , ice is on course to disappear entirely from the North Pole this year .
The disappearance of the Arctic sea ice , making it possible to reach the Pole sailing in a boat through open water , would be one of the most dramatic – and worrying – examples of the impact of global warming on the planet .
Scientists say the ice at 90 degrees north may well have melted away by the summer .
" From the viewpoint of science , the North Pole is just another point on the globe , but symbolically it is hugely important .
There is supposed to be ice at the North Pole , not open water , " said Mark Serreze of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado .

If it happens , it raises the prospect of the Arctic nations being able to exploit the valuable oil and mineral deposits below these a bed which have until now been impossible to extract because of the thick sea ice above .
Seasoned polar scientists believe the chances of a totally ice - free North Pole this summer are greater than 50:50 because the normally thick ice formed over many years at the Pole has been blown away and replaced by huge swathes of thinner ice formed over a single year .
This one - year ice is highly vulnerable to melting during the summer months and satellite data coming in over recent weeks shows that the rate of melting is faster than last year , when there was an all - time record loss of summer sea ice at the Arctic .
" The issue is that , for the first time that I am aware of , the North Pole is covered with extensive first - year ice – ice that formed last autumn and winter .
I 'd say it 's even - odds whether the North Pole melts out , " said Dr Serreze .
Each summer the sea ice melts before reforming again during the long Arctic winter but the loss of sea ice last year was so extensive that much of the Arctic Ocean became open water , with the water - ice boundary coming just 700 miles away from the North Pole .

This meant that about 70 per cent of the sea ice present this spring was single - year ice formed over last winter .
Scientists predict that at least 70 per cent of this single - year ice – and perhaps all of it – will melt completely this summer , Dr Serreze said .
" Indeed , for the Arctic as a whole , the melt season started with even more thin ice than in 2007 , hence concerns that we may even beat last year 's sea-ice minimum .
We 'll see what happens , a great deal depends on the weather patterns in July and August , " he said .
Ron Lindsay , a polar scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle , agreed that much now depends on what happens to the Arctic weather in terms of wind patterns and hours of sunshine .
" There 's a good chance that it will all melt away at the North Pole , it 's certainly feasible , but it 's not guaranteed , " Dr Lindsay said .
The polar regions are experiencing the most dramatic increase in average temperatures due to global warming and scientists fear that as more sea ice is lost , the darker , open ocean will absorb more heat and raise local temperatures even further .
Professor Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University , who was one of the first civilian scientists to sail underneath the Arctic sea ice in a Royal Navy submarine , said that the conditions are ripe for an unprecedented melting of the ice at the North Pole .
" Last year we saw huge areas of the ocean open up , which has never been experienced before .
People are expecting this to continue this year and it is likely to extend over the North Pole .
It is quite likely that the North Pole will be exposed this summer – it's not happened before , " Professor Wadhams said .
There are other indications that the Arctic sea ice is showing signs of breaking up .
Scientists at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre said that the North Water ' polynya ' – an expanse of open water surrounded on all sides by ice – that normally forms near Alaska and Banks Island off the Canadian coast , is much larger than normal .
Polynyas absorb heat from the sun and eat away at the edge of the sea ice .
Inuit natives living near Baffin Bay between Canada and Greenland are also reporting that the sea ice there is starting to break up much earlier than normal and that they have seen wide cracks appearing in the ice where it normally remains stable .
Satellite measurements collected over nearly 30 years show a significant decline in the extent of the Arctic sea ice , which has become more rapid in recent years .

Dafen is a village surrounded by the thriving metropolis of Shenzhen , and the origin of most of the world ’s reproduction oil paintings .
In the popular imagination Dafen ’s artists produce anonymous works for unknown customers , operating no differently than a faceless factory churning out counterfeits , replicas and nothing close to what would be considered art .
REGIONAL productively collaborated with the otherwise commoditized community in Dafen by asking selected individuals , some for the first time , to imagine themselves in their professional medium .
The final works show the technical , creative , and professional facets of the artists identities subsumed by the styles and relationships they maintain with specific famous artists .
The hybrid result of original subject with derivative style comments on originality , global cultural production and REGIONAL ’s cooperation with emerging enterprise forms that are internationalizing the village .
The product of the collaboration are sets of images ( seen below ) comprising a digital photo of the artist in his studio , an indicative painting of their usual output and an original self - portrait .
While the final works contain both the creative signature of the original masters and the emergent self - consciousness of the Dafen artists , it is equally important to note that they derived great fulfillment from using their talents freely , and were remunerated at a rate commensurate with the unique international nature of the project .
The series operates as a comment on iconicity in cultural reproduction and consumerism as well as posits strategies for enabling and activating creativity that would otherwise be absorbed by routine production .
The works produced with the talent of DAFEN are part of a continuing series of our international collaborations that seek to engage and encourage untapped creative , cultural and economic opportunity around the world .
The paintings seen below are to be featured in galleries worldwide in the coming year .

Antiwar.com Radio yesterday posted a very informative interview between Charles Goyette and Ron Paul .
At about 10 minutes into the interview , Goyette asked Congressman Paul about my comment on the blog regarding negotiations with the Republican party for a speaking slot at the Republican Convention in September convention .
Congressman Paul replied : â€ œI donâ€™t know where he got that information because there will be no negotiations .
And if they [ the Republican Party ] would call me up and ask – â€˜do you want to speak at the convention , â€ ™ I would probably say yes.â€ 
Paul added that â€ œthere is zero chance of that happening – so there are no negotiations going on.â€ 
Iâ€™m glad to hear that the Paul campaign is not currently negotiating for a speaking slot .
Itâ€™s good that seeking the podium at the convention will not impede Paulâ€™s criticism of Bushâ€™s foreign aggression .
As I have said before , Ron Paul is Americaâ€™s best congressman .
It is great that Paulâ€™s campaign has awakened many Americans to the perils of government and the value of liberty .
Paulâ€™s comments in the Antiwar.com Radio interview are especially helpful in resolving the different signals from his campaign staff and other officials in recent months on this issue :
The Washington Post reported on May 6 that â€ œPaulâ€™s campaign hopes to turn such support into upward of 50 delegates for the partyâ€™s national convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul in September , where he is gunning for a speaking slot.â€ 
On May 9 , the Boston Globe reported that Paul ’s Maine coordinator , Ken Lindell , declared , â€ œThe goal at the national convention is to get a speaking slot for Dr. Paul to deliver that message . ”
The Los Angeles Times blog on May 12 reported that Ron Paul supporters â€œhope to demonstrate their disagreements with McCain vocally at the convention through platform fights and an attempt to get Paul a prominent speaking slot.â€ 
Fox News reported the same day that according to Jesse Bentonâ€™s comments , â€ œPaul is planning on having as big a delegation as possible at the convention , and he continues to seek a speaking opportunity there , something the party has not offered to him yet.â€ 
The focus on a speaking slot has been mentioned by the campaign off and on going since early February .
On February 12 , MSNBC reported that after the Super Tuesday showings , â€ œPaulâ€™s goal , according to spokesman Benton , is to get a substantial delegation to convention ( they estimate they ’ll have about 42 delegates ) get a good speaking spot , and â€˜spread the conservative message.â€ ™ ”
These comments confirm what top operatives said at a meeting of a few dozen of Ron Paulâ€™s key supporters in Washington in late April , according to one attendee .
**
I hope Ron Paul gets a great speaking slot at the GOP convention .
Giving the delegates and the television audience a double - barrel dose of truth could be the best tonic the nation receives this Fall .
Ms Nonoo is a businesswoman with homes in Bahrain and London
Bahrain 's king has appointed a Jewish woman as the country 's envoy to the United States .
Houda Nonoo said she was proud to serve her country " first of all as a Bahraini " and that she was not chosen for the post because of her religion .
She is believed to be the Arab world 's first Jewish ambassador .
Ms Nonoo , 43 , has served as a legislator in Bahrain 's 40 - member Shura Council for three years and is head of the Bahrain Human Rights Watch .
" It is a great honour to have been appointed as the first female ambassador to the United States of America and I am looking forward to meeting this new challenge , " Ms Nonoo told the Associated Press news agency .
Her family is originally from Iraq , having moved to Bahrain over a century ago .
Bahrain has one of the world 's oldest and smallest Jewish communities .
It was , at one time , home to as many as 1,500 Jews .
Today the community has a synagogue and numbers around 50 people .
Bahrain is a close US ally but has no diplomatic relations with Israel .
It has a Shia Muslim majority , roughly 65 % of the population , but the ruling elite is Sunni .

The former New York City chief emergency manager Jerome Hauer , whose office was on the 23d floor of WTC 7 , was also a building collapse specialist , according to a recently uncovered New York Times article .
Hauer has attracted suspicion from the 9/11 truth movement because of his zeal to push the official story in the hours after the attack when details were still sketchy .
Hauer was also Managing Director of Kroll Associates – the company that provided security for the WTC complex on 9/11 – and he also betrayed advance knowledge of the anthrax attacks a week before they happened .
In a July 27 1999 NY Times article unearthed by 9/11 Blogger entitled What Could Go Wrong ?
It ’s His Job to Know , Hauer is given a glowing write - up by journalist Randy Kennedy .
“ There is one story he tells in which this fascination is quite literal … .
But another illustration , a bit more metaphorical , is hard to miss when you walk into his office on the 23rd floor of 7 World Trade Center , otherwise known as ” the bunker , ” the $ 13 million bulletproof , hurricane - proof , blackout - proof emergency crisis center opened by the city last month . ”
The article describes Building 7 for what it was , a structurally reinforced immovable object built for the express purpose of standing strong in a crisis situation , not the weakling tinderbox that allegedly became the first steel building in history to collapse from fire damage alone , according to debunkers like the BBC , the History Channel , Popular Mechanics and others .
Indeed , as the NY Times quotes Larry Silverstein as stating in 1989 , WTC 7 designers “ Built in enough redundancy to allow entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building ’s structural integrity , ” a solid structure that was again improved upon that year with “ More than 375 tons of steel – requiring 12 miles of welding . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The article describes Hauer ’s role , “ As the city ’s chief emergency manager , Mr. Hauer oversees the response to building collapses , of which there have been no shortage over the last three years . ”
Jerome Hauer : Pictured in 1996 with Rudy Giuliani .
“ For much of his professional life , it has been the task of Jerome M. Hauer , 47 , to know a lot about how things work so that when they stop working — when they fall down , when they get blown down or blown up , when they freeze or burst or burn out — he knows what to do .
Like all self - described emergency junkies , he sits around all day thinking up horrifying ways for things to be destroyed and people to die and then hoping that all his plans stay on the shelf .
Interesting therefore that Hauer would have his office in the middle of a 47 - storey building that collapsed into its own footprint within 7 seconds in the late afternoon of 9/11 having been hit by minimal debris and suffering limited fire damage .
The article emphasizes the emergencies Hauer would list in his resume that he was an expert on , “ Helicopter crash , subway fire , water main break , ice storm , heat wave , blackout , building collapse , building collapse , building collapse . ”
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks , Hauer appeared on CBS News with Dan Rather and immediately set about crafting a surprisingly affirmative explanation for the events and spun a yarn that soon became the official story .
Watch the clip .
Hauer was suspiciously keen to stress that the buildings were not demolished by explosives but by the planes that hit them , despite this being a complete reversal of what chief WTC architects and designers had concluded during studies about the impact of planes into the twin towers beforehand .
Hauer also pointed the finger directly at Bin Laden as the script began to unfold .
“ [ M ]y sense is that just the velocity of the plane and the fact that you have a plane filled with fuel hitting that building that burned , that the velocity of the plane certainly had an impact on the structure itself .
And then the fact that it burned and you had that intense heat probably weakened the structure as well .
And I think it was simply the planes hitting the buildings and causing the collapse , ” Hauer told Rather .
Rather also asks
Hauer if the attacks could have been carried out without state sponsorship .
Hauer replies : “ I ’m not sure I agree that this is necessarily state - sponsored .
It … certainly has the fingerprints of somebody like bin Laden . ”
Hauer was surprisingly “ accurate ” with his foreknowledge of how the official story would later appear to confirm all of his initial presumptions despite the chaos surrounding the attacks in the hours after they took place .
On 9/11 , Hauer was Managing Director of Kroll Associates , a security firm intertwined with the military - industrial complex that was also coincidentally in charge of security for the entire World Trade Center complex on that fateful day .
Furthermore , it was Hauer that reportedly advised the White House to begin taking Cipro , an antibiotic which is effective against anthrax , on the very day of 9/11 and one week before the first anthrax letter was received .
Two months after 9/11 , Hauer was part of a Council on Foreign Relations panel that released a document entitled Independent Task Force on America ’s Response to Terrorism , which in part called for alternative explanations behind 9/11 to be countered .
Hauer ’s almost instant and precise summation of the cause of building collapses that were completely unprecedented in history , along with his “ expertise ” in the characteristics of controlled demolition , in addition to his foreknowledge of the anthrax attacks and his position with Kroll Associates , justifiably continue to attract interest amongst researchers in the 9/11 truth movement .

Comment on this article
Gordon Brown is to fast - track the building of at least eight nuclear power stations to cut Britain 's dependence on oil following the dramatic rise in its price .
The Prime Minister will set " no upper limit " on the number of nuclear plants that will be built by private companies .
That would mean nuclear , which provides about 20 per cent of Britain 's electricity , could meet a bigger share after the new generation of nuclear stations come on stream over the next 15 years .
Mr Brown fears the UK could experience an energy supply crisis if it does not step up its nuclear programme .
He believes that fast - rising oil prices have tipped the balance even more in favour of nuclear and renewable energy , such as wind and wave power , since the Government published a White Paper in January , which backed nuclear .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Prime Minister 's growing enthusiasm for nuclear has provoked controversy .
Environmental groups believe that it is not safe and would land taxpayers with a huge clean - up bill after the new plants are decommissioned , pointing to the £ 73bn cost of phasing out the existing 10 reactors .
All except one of them – Sizewell B – will shut down over the next 15 years .
The Liberal Democrats also warned that a switch to more nuclear energy would do nothing to solve the immediate problems caused by the doubling of oil prices over the past year .
Yesterday , the Prime Minister outlined his vision of a " post- oil economy " , calling for " a renaissance of nuclear power " and " massive expansion " of renewable energy in which the North Sea becomes " the Gulf of the future " by harnessing the power of the wind .
He promised that on nuclear , Britain would work to ensure the best arrangements for security , safety and disposal .
Addressing 42 leaders from the EU , North Africa and Middle East at a " Union for the Mediterranean " summit in Paris , he said that oil dependency posed a threat to economic stability and family finances and was not environmentally sustainable .
He supported the creation of " sun farms " in the Sahara and across the region .
Britain's 10 existing nuclear stations generate about 10 gigawatts of electricity .
Their decommissioning could cause power cuts , ministers believe , because about a third of the nation 's coal and oil - fired power stations will also have to close to meet environmental laws .
The new generation of medium - sized nuclear reactors would each generate 1.2 gigawatts , so Mr Brown believes at least eight would be required to make up for the nuclear stations that become obsolete .
A Downing Street source said yesterday : " The industry will not make the long - term investment required to build a new nuclear power station if they think the Government is not totally committed to nuclear energy .
That is why the Tory vote against the Planning Bill was so dangerous . "
Most of the new power stations are expected to be built near existing sites , where opposition from local residents would be less as they could safeguard or create jobs .
Following applications by energy companies , the Government will confirm the location of the new plants in 2010 .
Energy firms believe they will start to generate electricity by 2017 .

A report for the Government by the energy analysts Jackson Consulting , published last year , rated the existing sites green , amber or red for their suitability for new reactors .
Those graded green were Hinkley Point , Somerset ; Sizewell , Suffolk ; Bradwell , Essex ; Dungeness , Kent ; Hartlepool , Co Durham ; Heysham , Lancashire ; Hunterston , North Ayrshire ; Torness , East Lothian ; and Wylfa , on the island of Anglesey .
Graded amber were : Calder Hall , Cumbria ; Oldbury , near Bristol ; and Chapelcross , near the Solway estuary .
Berkeley in Gloucestershire and Trydydd in Snowdonia , north Wales , were not suitable .
The Government insists no decisions on sites have yet been taken .
But new plants might not be built in Scotland .
The Scottish National Party administration in Edinburgh opposes nuclear power and its consent is needed for big power stations .
How nuclear power came back from the dead
A White Paper on energy , released in 2003 , described nuclear power as an " unattractive option " and included no plans to replace existing reactors when they closed .
Although it left a tiny door ajar open to more nuclear plants , Friends of the Earth said the policy sounded " the death knell " for nuclear power in Britain .
As climate change rose up the political agenda , former prime minister Tony Blair became convinced a new generation of nuclear plants would offer a low carbon component to energy needs .
In 2006 he said more nuclear plants should be built .
An advantage , he argued , would be that nuclear power would make Britain less dependent on imports such as gas from Russia .
There was a false start when the High Court ruled the Government had failed to consult properly over its nuclear plans .
A White Paper in January described nuclear power as safe , low carbon , affordable and dependable .
What should be the most important issue in this election is one that is rarely , if ever , addressed :
Why is U.S. military spending at the highest point , in inflation - adjusted dollars , than at any time since the end of World War II ?
Why , without a sophisticated military opponent in sight , is the United States spending trillions of dollars on the development of high - tech weapons systems that lost their purpose with the collapse of the Soviet Union two decades ago ?
You would n’t know it from the most - exhausting - ever presidential primary campaigns , but the 2009 defense budget commits the United States to spending more ( again , in real dollars ) to defeat a ragtag band of terrorists than it spent at the height of the Cold War fighting the Soviet superpower and what we alleged were its surrogates in the Korean and Vietnam wars .
The Pentagon ’s budget for fiscal year 2008 set a post - World War II record at $ 625 billion , and that does not include more than $ 100 billion in other federal budget expenditures for homeland security , nuclear weapons and so - called black budget -- or covert -- operations .
And what are we spending all this money on ?
We are talking high - tech war toys designed to fight a Cold War enemy that no longer exists , including the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter program , with its estimated total price tag of $ 300 billion , and Virginia - class submarines at $ 2.5 billion each .
Who cares that the terrorists lack submarines for the Navy to battle deep in the ocean , for which the Virginia - class submarine was designed ?
Then there are the F - 22 Raptor jet fighters that no longer fill a credible military purpose but will take $ 65 billion out of taxpayers ’ pockets .
The Raptor includes stealth technology and elaborate electronics designed to counter threatened leaps in Soviet war - fighting capability .
In 2005 , Lawrence J. Korb , an assistant secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration , wrote that the Raptor “ is the most unnecessary weapon system being built by the Pentagon . ”
Since President Bush ’s first year in office , according to the Government Accountability Office , the Defense Department has doubled its future planned investment in those ultra-pricey weapons from $ 790 billion to $ 1.6 trillion .
When pressed on why the massive weapons arsenal we already possess , which was credited with intimidating the Soviet Union into surrender , is n’t sufficient to keep the peace in a suddenly unipolar world , defense hawks sometimes cite what they claim is an emerging threat from China .
“ The Chinese are designing new classes of submarines with increased capabilities , ” said Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) .
“ If we do not move to produce two submarines a year as soon as possible , we are in serious danger of falling behind . ”
That is nonsense .
China is not even a serious regional power , as the Pentagon ’s 2007 report to Congress makes clear :
“ The intelligence community estimates China will take until the end of this decade or later to produce a modern force capable of defeating a moderate - size adversary . ”
The report noted that “ China ’s military is focused on assuring the capability to prevent Taiwan independence , ” but this last week the military threat to Taiwan gave way to a historic peace opening , with the first visit by the head of Taiwan ’s ruling party to the mainland since the 1949 revolution .
Oh , and here ’s another thing .
Those Virginia - class submarines that Lieberman says are so important to our national security and for which he lobbied so hard ?
General Dynamics ’ Electric Boat Co. has received multibillion - dollar contracts to build them .
The company is based in Connecticut , suggesting that the real goal here was to find an enemy -- any enemy -- that would justify spending U.S. tax dollars on weapons produced in his home state .
Since the 9/11 attacks , the United States has been on a madcap spending spree on wars and weapons having little , if anything , to do with combating terrorism , nothing to do with the imaginary threat from China and everything to do with sustaining an enormously bloated defense industry threatened with extinction because of the demise of the communist enemy .
The fact is , the end of the Cold War was a welcome development for everyone except for those in the military - industrial complex whose profits and jobs , as President Eisenhower famously warned , are rooted in every congressional district .
As President George H.W. Bush noted in his 1992 State of the Union address , “ communism died this year , ” and , he promised , “ we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower .
Now we can look homeward even more and set right what needs to be set right . ”
Toward that end , he ordered his secretary of Defense , Dick Cheney , to initiate a 30 % cut in defense spending .
Gloom and doom in the military - industrial complex was palpable .
But then came what defense industry lobbyists and their many allies on both sides of the aisle in Congress came to treat as the gift of 9/11 , offering dramatic imagery of a new global enemy .
Fortunately for those who profit from a permanent war economy , few in government or the media were inclined to challenge the enemy bait - and - switch game that unfolded .
The defense industry and the Pentagon bureaucracy that services it were all too happy to accept whatever war they could embrace , even if the new “ global war on terrorism ” that President George W. Bush launched was to be fought against an enemy armed primarily with weapons that could be purchased for a few dollars at Home Depot .
The Soviets had developed the most modern arsenals , and the 9/11 hijackers were armed with box cutters , so how could we justify spending more to defeat Al Qaeda than we ever did to combat the communist enemy ?
That is the third - rail issue that politicians and the media dread touching because of the national security hysteria generated after the 9/11 attacks .
Yet no presidential candidate can be serious about cutting the federal debt , improving education , holding down taxes or paying for any of the other things that the candidates of both parties promise without cutting military spending .
Without slashing the inflated military budget , the next president , who will inherit at least a $ 400 - billion current - accounts deficit along with debt service on seven years of profligate military spending , will not be able to finance any of the domestic reforms that both the surviving Republican candidate and his two Democratic opponents advocate .
Maybe one can make a case that it is appropriate that more than half of the discretionary funds in the 2009 budget go to defense , and all the other federal programs for science , education , infrastructure , global warming and nonmilitary international programs compete for the rest .
But is n’t it bizarre that the biggest peacetime military budget in U.S. history -- 35 % higher than when Bush came into office and larger than the military budgets of all other nations combined -- is not even discussed in the current presidential contest ?
That is because politicians from both parties are complicit in the waste of taxpayer dollars on weapons systems that deliver jobs to their home districts and profits to their defense industry campaign contributors .
It is a disease of our political system predicted by two of our great wartime generals - turned - president .
First was George Washington , warning in his farewell address that once a nation embarks on the path of imperial adventure , the irrationality of false patriotic appeals would trump reason .
What better time to recall Washington ’s historic caution to the nation “ to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism . ”
In Eisenhower ’s farewell address , he warned that “ in the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist . ”
There is no better evidence of the prescience of Washington and Eisenhower than the fact that the most obscenely bloated military budget in U.S. history is not an issue in the current presidential campaign .
Sadly , defense spending has become enshrined in our political system as a totem to be worshiped rather than a policy program to be critically examined .
Robert Scheer , who wrote an Op - Ed column for The Times for 13 years , is the editor in chief of Truthdig ( truthdig.com ) and the author , most recently , of “ The Pornography of Power : How Defense Hawks Hijacked 9/11 and Weakened America , ” to be published this week by Twelve Books .
Why Python Rocks III : Parameter expansion
Okay .
So what ’s cool about Python ?
I ca n’t count the number of times I ’ve had to show skeptics why Python is cool , what Python can do that their favorite language ca n’t do .
So I ’m writing a bunch of articles showing off Python ’s Awesomeness .
All articles in this series :
I was n’t actually planning on making this the third article in this series , but I was just working on a little calendaring application and came up with a simple solution to a certain problem that demonstrates perfectly why Python is such an awesome language .
Python : Dynamic
If you ’ve read previous installments in this series of articles , you may have noticed that Python is fairly dynamic .
Introspection such as the dir ( ) built - in , getattr ( ) , setattr ( more on those in a later article ) and other dynamic features make it very easy to accomplish things in Python that can be a big pain in a lot of other , less dynamic , languages .
As an example , I ’d like to show you something on function parameters .
The premise
Suppose we have the following function ( that we ’re not allowed to change ) , which takes a bunch of named parameters and does something with it :
def person ( firstname= ' John ' , lastname= ' Doe ' , age=20 , email='unknown@example.com ' ) : print ' %s , %s ( %s ) : %s ' % ( lastname , firstname , age , email )
Every parameter in the above function has a default value .
When calling it , you can randomly leave out parameters , and Python will fill them in for you :
person ( firstname= ' Pete ' , age =25 ) person( lastname= ' Johnson ' , email='j.johnson@example.com ')
The output of which is :
Doe , Pete ( 25 ) : unknown@example.com Johnson , John ( 20 ) : j.johnson@example.com
Now suppose we have input from a file or something , which we need to pass to the function .
However , the records in the input do n’t have all the required fields .
Sometimes ‘ age ’ might be missing , or another field – you just do n’t know in advance .
The input might look like this :
firstname : Jane , lastname : Foo , email:jane@gmail.com age :15 , firstname : Jake
These are two records , for two persons : Jane and Jake .
Parsing this data is easy , but when we want to pass the data to the function , we run into a problem :
Not all the fields are present in the data .
Jake ’s last name is unknown , for instance .
We do n’t know which fields are missing , so we ca n’t just call the function like we normally would .
Proper Object Oriented languages provide method overloading which allows the developer to specify multiple versions of the same method with a different number of parameters .
But we do n’t know the order of the parameters either !
Besides , it takes a lot of time and code to write all those methods .
What if you ’ve got twenty parameters ?
One way of doing it …
In less dynamic languages one solution would be to redefine the default values for the function call and then overwrite them with the parsed data ’s values .
Something along the lines of this :
s = ' firstname : Jane , lastname : Foo , email:jane@gmail.com
age : 15 , firstname : Jake ' for record in s.split ( '
' ) : firstname = ' John ' lastname = ' Doe ' age = 20 email = 'unknown@example.com ' for field in record.split ( ' , ' ) : key , value = field .split ( ':') if key == ' firstname ' : # Big , ugly IF structure firstname = value elif key == ' lastname ' : lastname = value elif key == ' age ' : age = value elif key == ' email ' : email = value person ( firstname , lastname , age , email )
Not a very clean solution , especially if you ’ve got a lot of parameters .
A better way : parameter expansion
Python , in its dynamic nature , offers a very nice solution for this which I will call parameter expansion .
Here ’s how it works :
def foo( a , b , c ) : print a , b , c data = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) # Tuple containing the parameter values foo ( * data ) # output : 1 2 3
When * data is encountered by Python , it expands the tuple into the parameters for the function , making the line equivalent to : foo ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
Of course that ’s no good for our situation , because we do n’t know which parameters will be present in the input .
No worries , because we can also use a dictionary to fill in the function ’s parameters :
def foo ( a=1 , b=2 , c=3 ) : print a , b , c data = { ' a ' : 5 , 'c ' : 9 } foo ( ** data ) # output : 5 2 9
There we go !
Python neatly expands the dictionary ’s keys and values to the parameters of the function , making the call equivalant to : foo( a=5 , c=9 ) .
We can use this to map our data to the function we ’ve got :
def person ( firstname= ' John ' , lastname= ' Doe ' , age=20 , email='unknown@example.com ' ) : print ' %s , %s ( %s ) : %s ' % ( lastname , firstname , age , email ) s = ' firstname : Jane , lastname : Foo , email:jane@gmail.com
age : 15 , firstname : Jake ' for record in s.split ( '
' ) : # [' firstname : Jane , lastname : Foo , email:jane@gmail.com ' , ..] personinfo = {} for field in record. split ( ' , ' ) : # [' firstname : Jane ' , ' lastname : Foo ' , ..] personinfo.update( #
Add the key , value to the personinfo dictionary dict ( # {' firstname ' : ' Jane'} ( field.split ( ' :' ) , ) # ( [ ' firstname ' , ' Jane ' ] ) ) ) person (** personinfo ) # Call person ( ) with the dict expanded to params
Output of the above :
Foo , Jane ( 20 ) : jane@gmail.com Doe , Jake ( 15 ) : unknown@example.com
Now it does n’t matter which records are present in the input , nor which order they come in .
For each record in the input ( each line ) , we create a ‘ personinfo ’ dictionary and then add each key / value pair we encounter in the input to that dictionary .
The code dict ( ( field.split ( ' : ' ) , ) ) may look a little mystic .
What is does is , it splits the ‘ field ’ variable on the ‘:’ , which gives us a two - value list of the key and value [ ' firstname ' , ' Jane ' ] .
When you put that list in another list , you can then cast it to a dictionary .
For example :
x = ( ( ' a ' , 2 ) , ( 'b ' , 3 ) ) print dict ( x ) # output : {'a ' : 2 , 'b ' : 3}
Variable arguments
Naturally we can also do it the other way around .
Instead of not having to know the parameters when we call the function , we can also just as easily not know the parameters inside the function :
def person ( * args , ** kwargs ) : for k , v in kwargs.items ( ) : print ' %s = %s ' % ( k , v )
This defines a function with a variable amount of normal ( positional ) parameters ( * args ) and a variable amount of keyword parameters ( ** kwargs ) .
When we call the function , it now outputs :
lastname = Foo email = jane@gmail.com firstname = Jane age = 15 firstname = Jake
We can do all kinds of neat things with the ‘ person ’ function now .
For instance , to create SQL queries :
def person ( *args , ** kwargs ) : keys = kwargs.keys ( ) values = [ ] for v in kwargs.values ( ) : values.append ( " ' %s ' " % ( v ) ) sql = 'INSERT INTO foo ( %s ) VALUES ( %s ) ; ' % ( ' , '. join ( keys ) , ' , '.join ( values ) ) print sql
Output :
INSERT INTO foo ( lastname , email , firstname ) VALUES ( ' Foo ' , 'jane@gmail.com ' , ' Jane ' ) ; INSERT INTO foo ( age , firstname ) VALUES ( ' 15 ' , ' Jake ' ) ;
( This is silly example of course ; it assumes all columns are text and all columns can have NULL values .
Also , the quoting of the values could be done better using list comprehensions , but that ’s something for a later article in this series .
It ’s just an example okay ;-) ) .
Conclusion
As you ’ve hopefully seen , simple dynamic concepts in Python such as parameter expansion allow us to do things easier and cleaner than in other , less dynamic languages .
In other languages you may have to do weird tricks to accomplish these things , or adjust your data structures and code to make such things easier .
Something which might not always be possible if you ’re using a third - party closed library .
We have to be careful when doing such dynamic things though .
Many problems lurk just around the corner .
If the data you ’re using is untrusted ( for instance , from a remote host or a webbrowser ) , this kind of dynamic programming might make it easier for your code to be exploited .
Unreliable data may also cause errors in your code , when it does n’t contain what you expected it to contain .
Remember to always sanitize your input !
Another problem with dynamic coding could be that it makes it harder to understand what is happening when looking at the code .
Remember that a clear , easy to understand solution is better than a clever but hard to understand one .
I ’ll see you in the next installment of this series of articles !

" The best game of this generation is only available on the PlayStation 4 , and is a must play for all gamers . "
The PlayStation 4 is still one of the most popular consoles of its generation .
Combined with its two variants , the smaller PS4 Slim and the more powerful 4K HDR - capable PS4 Pro , there are plenty of fantastic games to pick from .
Sony has some of the best exclusives , with games like God of War , Persona 5 , Spiderman , and Shadow of the Colossus .
They meld fun and challenging gamplay with a compelling storyline to create unforgettable experiences .
The game is story - driven , but also has a number of missions ranging from heists and train robberies , to cattle rustling and bordellos .
The scenery is beautiful , with rugged mountains , open plains , swift rivers , and a range of environments including rain and snow .
Anyone who loved the previous iteration in 2010 , will love Red Dead Redemption 2 as well .
Red Dead Redemption 2 is Rockstar 's action - adventure game focused on the world of outlaws and cowboys .
The game is set out west where two outlaws are on the run from federal agents and bounty hunter .
As the main character , Arthur Morgan , you have to rob , steal , and fight to survive in the harsh and lawless environment of the west .
While not the first thing to pop up when you think " horror game " , Bloodborne is a scary good time and a must - play for thrill seekers and adrenaline addicts .
It 's not a traditional horror game because its main intent is not to scare you at every possible moment , but this game is definitely frightening and fits the bill perfectly .
Bloodborne is an action RPG that is set in a twisted Halloween inspired town , and around every corner is a werewolf or zombie or horrible Cthulu type beast that wants to rip you to shreds .
You create as a custom hunter , who wields a blade or ax and a pistol or shotgun , and have to fight your way past the creepy citizens and monsters to earn blood vials and blood echoes .
Bloodborne is a game drenched in a spooky atmosphere , with disgusting bosses and haunting sound effects , and is downright hardcore in its treatment towards the player .
This is a hard game , but worth it to learn its ways and master its combat , and one of the best the PS4 has to offer .
" If you take the gameplay and combat of Tomb Raider or Assassin 's Creed Odyssey .
mix it with robot dinosaurs and a young adult female protagonist , you get Horizon Zero Dawn .
It 's my favorite game to play on the PS4 . " — Ajay Kumar , Tech Editor
Robot dinosaurs .
There is n't much else that needs to be said to sell you on this game , but that alone is the most awesome thing in a video game and there are plenty of them in Horizon Zero Dawn .
This is a new franchise for Sony and the PS4 , and it follows protagonist Aloy as she enters into a world that is equal parts post - apocalypse and tribal prehistoric times .
She gets sucked into a narrative quickly , and you have to get to the bottom of a pretty good mystery while using arrows and bombs to take down robot dinosaurs and other animals fused with technology .
Horizon is an open world game , and you can freely explore the world looking for side quests to complete , merchants to barter with , fast travel points , and unlockables and hidden goodies .
But mostly , this is a game about robot dinosaurs , and figuring out ways to either trick them into traps , hack them to fight alongside you , or just bash them down with your bow .
While Spider - Man can do whatever a spider can , thankfully in this PS4 exclusive you can do whatever he can as well now .
You play as Peter Parker , Mary Jane Watson , and Miles Morales throughout the campaign , but are primarily the titular webhead , and there is a bustling and riveting New York City to explore .
You 'll encounter the typical enemies and villains ( Doc Ock , Kingpin , Electro , Rhino , etc. ) and get upgradeable gadgets to help you take down foes .
Spidey can ride the subway to get around , or just run around rooftops listening to a podcast from J. Jonah Jameson .
The story follows Peter and Aunt Mae , and the main antagonist Mr. Negative , and you 'll swing from mission to mission solving mysteries , stopping crimes , and getting into acrobatic feats of strength and agility .
This is a dream come true for comic book fans , and the perfect superhero game to buy for your PS4 .
A PlayStation 2 classic , Shadow of the Colossus got a complete top - to - bottom remaster and it looks like a brand new game .
It also got some new control options , so it plays a lot better too , since the original had some clunky controls .
The game is structured in a unique way , where the bulk of the journey is taking down massive giant monsters in epic boss battles , and if that sounds repetitive and monotonous to you then I 'm sorry , that 's mostly what you 'll be doing .
But if that sounds awesome to you , then this is the right game to purchase because you will literally climb skyscraper - sized creatures to take them down in an effort to bring back the love of your life .
You ride on your horse and battle boss after boss , some flying around , some in the water , and some charging straight at you like a bull .
But no matter the odds , you have to defeat every last one , and it 's satisfying all the way until the end .
Mortal Kombat 11 pleases both beginners and veterans , allowing the former to punch buttons and hope for the best while the latter has time to be methodical and go for the kill .
With each fight , you can customize your character 's looks and earn currency to unlock more later .
There ’s enough contained within the single player and multiplayer modes to add hours upon hours of replayability .
In fact , there ’s so much single - player content it ’s almost easy to forget about the hours of cut - scenes that pace the story - line or the online modes where you can test your might against competitors all over the world via the PlayStation Network .
If the stomach - turning fatalities did n't grab your attention initially , the sublime fighting mechanics will hook you in and never let go .
This is a love letter to fans everywhere and a bunch of fun to play with your friends , so we highly recommend you jump into the fray .
There ’s little time wasted as players are off to the JRPG races being thrown into the deep end of a mystery casino heist .
It ’s here that the gameplay takes itself to a new level as one moment you 're crawling through a dungeon or fighting a boss and the next you 're thrown back into that of a teenage life simulator .
Both sections of the game are done so satisfyingly that there 's no disappointment in switching from one to the next as they 're equally engaging .
Persona 5 stands out as one of the premiere role - playing games in the genre over the last few years .
The beautiful anime style pairs well with turn - based combat mechanics making for a combination that ’s hard to beat on any platform .
The main protagonist adds a satisfyingly deep story - line by discovering how to harness his Persona powers all while studying for midterms and attempting to having a social life .
You play as Geralt , a monster hunting Witcher who gets entangled in a search for a king 's missing daughter , and a war between two factions .
Geralt and his band of whimsical sidekicks and love interests travel around the world by horseback and boat to take on missions , save citizens from ghosts and goblins , and sit down at a tavern to play some cards every once in a while .
The Witcher 3 is the epitome of the series , a grand masterpiece of sword - wielding heroes and horrible creatures that rivals any in the fantasy genre .
If you 're looking to get sucked into a game for months , you need not look further than The Witcher games .
The brilliance of The Witcher 3 is that its graphics are n't essential to the experience , but that it stands on its strong gameplay and storytelling to truly immerse its players .
What we love so much about Wild Hunt is the sense that the world in which it takes place is alive — that there are creatures hiding over the hill on that horizon or people behind every door in that city .
This kind of immersive realism takes incredible lore and attention to detail , and thankfully the game is visually stunning so you wo n't be bored poking through every nook and cranny .
" The models are sleek looking , and each of the characters feels like it fits into the same world .
Maps are also different and visually interesting , with lots of great details . " — Kelsey Simon , Product Tester
If your mission is escorting an EMP device in London or protecting the secrets of a temple in Egypt , each battle demands proper tactics .
Each of the globetrotting maps takes time to learn and master , which keeps users coming back for more .
And there are always new events , new maps , new characters , and new modes being added all the time so the fun truly never stops !
With millions of players competing in six - versus - six matchups , Overwatch has cemented itself as one of the leading multiplayer games on the PlayStation 4 .
Right from the start , Overwatch sets itself up as a fun , playful game with plenty of charm .
You have a choice of dozens of colorful characters including a very smart gorilla and a gun-slinging cowboy , each with their own unique battlefield perspectives .
Our reviewer liked how every character has its own set of powers and abilities that can quickly shift the tide of battle .
To keep gameplay even , no character 's primary weapon will help you achieve victory every time , so mix and match to make your team 's synergy better than your opponent .
" God of War mixes brutal action and challenging puzzles against the backdrop of Norse mythology and the relationship between Kratos and his son .
It makes for an incredibly compelling game . " — Ajay Kumar , Tech Editor
But it retains its patented , sadistic action , the main staple of the series , so you wo n't have to miss out on fighting monsters and demons .
The cinematic nature of God of War is one never attempted in games before : the entire campaign is done in one continuous longshot , never cutting away ever .
This game features stylized combat , intricate puzzles , hidden collectibles , a more open world to explore , and an epic story that is much more mature than previous entries .
So far in this console generation , one game stands out as the clearcut example of what gaming can achieve as an art form .
Surprisingly , that game is God of War , which on paper sounds like the most cartoonish and juvenile thing imaginable , but we promise it is not !
The critically acclaimed series has updated its tone , setting , style , and main weapon for this reboot .
God of War has you playing as Kratos , the demigod son of Zeus who is known for his brutality and constant need for revenge .
He makes his way from Greek mythology to Norse this time around and uses a magical ax to fend off foes protecting his son Atreus .
Its a game about parenting , the burden of passing on your past to your family 's future , responsibility , and trust .
Final Verdict
The best PlayStation 4 games are ones that mix an interesting gameplay loop and great graphics with a compelling storyline .
For those features , you wo n't do better than God of War .
Telling the story of a father and son , the game 's backdrop of Norse mythology , challenging boss battles , and unique setting make it one of the most memorable games to play .
For something more lighthearted and fun , we like the battle royale Overwatch .
It has lots of fun gameplay modes , unique battlefield , and quirky characters .

What to Look for When Buying PS4 Games
Gameplay -
The way in which you interact with other players and the game ’s challenges , also known as gameplay , will largely determine your experience .
In cooperative gameplay , for instance , you ’ll team up with other players and work together to defeat an AI opponent , whereas in competitive gameplay , you ’ll be pit against other players .
In linear gameplay , you ’ll be tasked with challenges must be completed in a specific order , whereas in nonlinear gameplay , there can be many sequences .
Consider what you ’re looking to get out of your gaming experience and choose accordingly .
Graphics - Graphics are separate from gameplay .
In general , the more realistic the graphics , the more immersive the game will be .
That ’s not always the case , though , because not all games are intended to be realistic .
Some cartoon games are equally as enveloping , especially if they are geared towards younger kids .
Rating - “ Rated T for Teen , ” “ Rated E for Everyone . ”
These are phrases you hear at the end of every video game commercial , but what does it really mean ?
The letter rating in the corner of each video game box displays its Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) rating and it ’s made up of three parts : Rating categories ( “ E ” for everyone ; “ E10 + ” for ages 10 and up ; “ T ” for teens ; “ M ” for mature 17 + ; and “ A ” for adults only ) , Content Descriptors ( Comic mischief , mild language , etc. ) and Interactive Elements ( In - Game Purchases , Users Interact , Shares Location , Unrestricted Internet , etc. ) .
Be sure to check this before buying a game , especially if it ’s a gift .

Everyone who 's ever found themselves at the side of the road in a car that 's died has thought , " What 's this gonna cost ? " and suspected they 're about to get reamed .
It 's a common feeling because most people have no idea what it really costs to , say , replace a fuel pump .
A California start - up has launched a Web site that will give you an idea of what it ought to cost so you know if your mechanic is on the level .
RepairPal.com used reams of auto industry data and insights from more than two dozen mechanics to create a database it says covers more than 20 billion estimates to repair just about anything that could happen to just about anything on the road .
Think of it as the Kelley Blue Book of auto repair .
" We 're bringing transparency to a huge industry , " says CEO and co-founder David Sturtz .
" Our goal is to minimize the anxiety and uncertainty that consumers typically feel when they service their cars . "
Sturtz says Americans make about 2 million visits to a repair shop every day , and in most cases they have no idea if they 're paying too much .
He did n't , which is one reason he launched the site .
" I did n't like the fact I could n't tell if I was getting screwed or not , " he told Wired.com .
He started building the site about 18 months ago , when he called several mechanics to get estimates for basic repairs like changing the oil and replacing brake pads .
The estimates were all over the map , even within the same city , with no rhyme or reason to it .
Then he had women make the same calls to the same shops - and found the quotes they got averaged 17 percent more than the ones he got .
" Women are clearly a big target " user for the site , Sturtz says .
" They almost universally feel they 're getting ripped off , an our data suggests that they are . "
Sturtz enlisted the help of more than two dozen mechanics and an army of number - crunchers to build the database and search engine that drives RepairPal.com .
The dataset includes everything from the cost of a spark plug to the time required to install a clutch .
They drew on their own experiences , automakers ' factory labor time guides - huge books , generally available only to professional mechanics , that outline how long specific repairs should take - and piles of service receipts .
" We 've ... run statistical analyses to determine pricing patterns across geographies , brands and service channels , " Sturtz says .
In other words , you can use the site to figure replacing the clutch in your 1993 Civic will run you $ 658 to $ 1,032 if you live in Oakland or putting a muffler on a 2005 Pontiac G6 will set you back somewhere between $ 283 and $ 482 if you 're in Boston .
That 's a ballpark as big as Yankee Stadium , but Sturtz says it accounts for price variances between dealerships and independent shops as well between genuine OEM and generic parts .
The site covers 500 makes and models going back to 1990 , a figure Sturtz says includes 94 percent of the cars on the road .
It covers about 75 percent of the repairs anyone might ever have to make - from replacing a headlamp bulb to installing new CV joints - and offers a rundown of things that might have caused the problem in the first place .
Of course , all that info is n't much help if you have the car hauled to a shady shop , so RepairPal.com has a database of 286,000 repair shops and will recommend some in your area .
As people use the site , they 'll be asked to provide reviews of the shops they use .
The site 's free - Sturtz plans to use targeted advertising to pay the bills - but if you 're willing to spend a few bucks , you can get advice from a certified mechanic .

Gestalt psychology attempts to understand psychological phenomena by viewing them as organised and structured wholes rather than the sum of their constituent parts .
Thus , Gestalt psychology dissociates itself from the more ' elementistic '/ reductionistic / decompositional approaches to psychology like structuralism ( with its tendency to analyse mental processes into elementary sensations ) and it accentuates concepts like emergent properties , holism , and context .
In the 30s and 40s Gestalt psychology was applied to visual perception , most notably by Max Wertheimer , Wolfgang Köhler , and Kurt Koffka who founded the so - called gestalt approaches to form perception .
Their aim was to investigate the global and holistic processes involved in perceiving structure in the environment ( e.g. Sternberg 1996 ) .
More specifically , they tried to explain human perception of groups of objects and how we perceive parts of objects and form whole objects on the basis of these .
The investigations in this subject crystallised into " the gestalt laws of perceptual organization . "
Some of these laws , which are often cited in the HCI or interaction design community , are as follows .
22.0.1 Law of proximity
The law of proximity posits that when we perceive a collection of objects , we will see objects close to each other as forming a group .
In figure 1.A. , we perceive the MTV logo and the logo for the Europe Music Awards as forming a group in the top left corner and the logos of the sponsors as forming a group in the bottom right corner .
The white space separating the two groups of logos is used to indicate ' grouping ' , and the proximity of the logos of each groups is thus used to this end .
Thus , a semantic separation of ' organisers ' from ' sponsors ' is achieved via structuring the graphical layout in accordance with this simple principle of perceptual organisation .
Figure 1.B is taken from Kazaa Media Desktop , where the law of proximity is used in designing the user interface of the popular peer - to - peer ( P2P ) software .
As shown by the screen dump , the user can choose between P2P and web search .
The group of radio buttons underneath are only associated with the P2P search and not the web search .
To signal this association to the user , the vertical row of radio buttons are placed comparatively closer to the P2P - search radio button .
Figure 1.C is a typical textbook example , exemplifying how the law of proximity groups the items into 3 groups as opposed to 8 individual items .
22.0.2 Law of similarity
The law of similarity captures the idea that elements will be grouped perceptually if they are similar to each other .
In the " preferences window " of the Opera browser ( figure 2.A ) , colour is used to make the user group the menu items on the basis of their background colour .
The grey background of the first four menu items thus " tie them together " .
Figure 2.B. is a typical textbook example of the principle of similarity , whereby we see the circles and triangles as forming four horizontal rows ( or at least some configuration where triangles and circles are grouped depending on their shape ) .
Objects similar to each other thus tend to be seen as a unit .
22.0.3 Law of Prägnanz ( figure - ground )
Edgar Rubin , a Danish psychologist , was the first to systematically investigate the figure - ground phenomenon .
The phenomenon captures the idea that in perceiving a visual field , some objects take a prominent role ( the figures ) while others recede into the background ( the ground ) .
The visual field is thus divided into these two basic parts .
This effect is often used by smart logo makers , as figure 3.A , B , and C suggest :
The logo of visitnorway.com can be viewed as both three separate elements of blue , green and navy colour .
It may , however , also be viewed as a person stretching his / her arms into the air .
Similarly , the logo of the Gnome Desktop Environment ( figure 3.B. ) can be viewed as both a " G " and a footprint .
Lastly , the Macintosh logo can be viewed as a regular happy face and a happy face in profile ( looking at a computer screen ) .
Common to these logos is that you can focus on only one " interpretation " at a time ; you cannot observe both the figure and ground at the same time , as ground will become figure when shifting the focus .
It should be noted that the figure - ground is most often exemplified using the Rubin Face / Vase Illusion , named after Edgar Rubin .
22.0.4 Law of symmetry
The law of symmetry captures the idea that when we perceive objects we tend to perceive them as symmetrical shapes that form around their centre .
Most objects can be divided in two more or less symmetrical halves and when for example we see two unconnected elements that are symmetrical , we unconsciously integrate them into one coherent object ( or percept ) .
The more alike objects are , they more they tend to be grouped .
In the above ( figure 4.A ) , CSC Finland 's logo is perceived as an integral whole although the two constituent geometrical shapes seem to be pointing in different directions and have differing colours .
A typical textbook example of the law of symmetry ( figure 4.B. ) , consists of a configuration of a number of brackets .
When perceiving the configuration , we see three pairs of symmetrical brackets as opposed to 6 individual brackets , or two pairs and two singles .
This happens despite what is suggested by some of the brackets immediate proximity to each other .
22.0.5 Law of closure
The law of closure posits that we perceptually close up , or complete , objects that are not , in fact , complete .
In the above , we perceive the letters ' I ' , ' B ' , and ' M ' although the shapes we see , in fact , are only lines of white space of differing length hovering above each other .
Similarly , we see the figure on Paul Thagard 's book ( figure 5.B. ) as forming a three - dimensional box although all we see , in fact , is 24 dissimilar red shapes ( count for yourself ! ) on a dark red background .
Figure 5.C. is the typical textbook example of the law of closure ; we perceive a circle and not 8 individual circles .
The Gestalt approach can be said to be a " bottom - up " theory as it starts from the bottom ( the aspects of the stimuli that influence perception ) and work its way up to higher - order cognitive processes .
An example of another bottom - up theory ( of perception ) that is well - known in the HCI community is James Gibson 's theory of " direct perception " ( see affordances and perception ) .

The Wikimedia Foundation has received a copyright infringement claim from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , widely known as the Mormon Church or LDS Church .
The infringement claim is in reference to a URL used as a source in a Wikinews article about Mormon Church documents leaked to the website Wikileaks , titled " Copy of handbook for leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints obtained by Wikinews " .
The URL was originally cited as a link in the sources subsection of the article .
The Wikimedia Foundation is a donor - supported non-profit organization which runs Wikipedia and Wikinews .
This is the first time that the Wikimedia Foundation has received a copyright infringement claim regarding an article published by Wikinews .
The Wikinews article , originally published on April 19 , described material in the Church Handbook of Instructions .
The work is a two - volume book of policies and is a guide for leaders of the Mormon Church .
Wikinews obtained the Church Handbook of Instructions from Wikileaks , a whistleblower website which publishes anonymous submissions of sensitive documents while preserving the anonymity of its contributors .
Wikileaks describes the material as significant because " ... the book is strictly confidential among the Mormon ( Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , aka LDS in short form ) bishops and stake presidents and it reveals the procedure of handling confidential matters related to tithing payment , excommunication , baptism and doctrine teaching ( indoctrination ) . "
The material was released on the Wikileaks website on April 16 , and according to the site was first made available on the document sharing website Scribd .
A message at Scribd now states : " This content was removed at the request of copyright agent B. S. Broadbent of the Intellectual Property Division of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints . "
On May 5 , the Wikimedia Foundation received a copyright infringement claim from Intellectual Reserve , Inc. , the legal entity that owns the intellectual property of the Mormon Church .
The infringement claim is addressed to Jimmy Wales , the designated agent of the Wikimedia Foundation , and requests that access to the link to Wikileaks be removed .
The link was removed from the article on May 5 by a Wikinews administrator , and the article remains available without the link .
The infringement claim was sent by Berne S. Broadbent , president of Intellectual Reserve , Inc. and director of the Intellectual Property Division of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
According to Mike Godwin , general counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation , the Mormon Church has not filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) notice with the foundation .
In 1999 , Jerald and Sandra Tanner , prominent critics of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , released material from the Church Handbook of Instructions to the Internet through their organization Utah Lighthouse Ministry , without including the copyright notice of Intellectual Reserve , Inc. or obtaining permission from the church .
The website of the Utah Lighthouse Ministry describes as its purpose : " ... to document problems with the claims of Mormonism and compare LDS doctrines with Christianity . "
The Tanners had received a copy of the 1998 edition of Church Handbook of Instructions from an anonymous sender in October 1999 .
They published 17 pages of the 160 - page handbook on the Utah Lighthouse Ministry website .
The church sent the Tanners a letter threatening a copyright infringement lawsuit if the material was not removed , and the Tanners removed the material from their site the same day , and posted the church 's letter to their website .
The website still contained links to other locations that had the material , and an article in the Salt Lake Tribune listed addresses of these links .
The church sued the Tanners through its company Intellectual Reserve , in the 1999 case Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry .
The plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 13 , 1999 , and the United States district court issued a preliminary injunction on December 6 , 1999 barring posting of the material by the defendants as well as posting links to other websites which contain the material .
The New York Times and other news publications called the injunction a " chilling effect " .
In November 2002 , the church dropped the lawsuit against Utah Lighthouse Ministry , on condition that the Tanners destroy all copies of the Church Handbook of Instructions , and not include more than 50 words at a time from the handbook in any of their future articles .

Bank Julius Baer sued Wikileaks after sending cease and desist letters in January 2008 which cited the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
As a result of the lawsuit , the bank obtained an injunction preventing the site 's domain name registrar from associating with Wikileaks , but this injunction was lifted in March 2008 and Bank Julius Baer dropped the case .
As of May 13 Wikileaks had not taken down the material on the Church Handbook of Instructions , and a second webpage at the site with a different version of the material was also still available .
In a statement to Wikinews , a Wikileaks representative commented on the material hosted at the site : " WikiLeaks will not remove the handbooks , which are of substantial interest to current and former mormons [ sic ] .
WikiLeaks will remain a place where people from around the world can safely reveal the truth . "

Ramallah , West Bank
When I reported from Israel in the mid-1980s , the big debate here was whether Israel ’s settlement - building in the West Bank had passed a point of no return  a point where any serious withdrawal became virtually impossible to imagine .
The question was often framed as : “ Is it five minutes to midnight or five minutes after midnight ? ”
Well , having taken a little drive through part of the West Bank , as I always do when I visit , it strikes me more than ever that it ’s not only five after midnight , it ’s five after midnight and a whole week later .
The West Bank today is an ugly quilt of high walls , Israeli checkpoints , “ legal ” and “ illegal ” Jewish settlements , Arab villages , Jewish roads that only Israeli settlers use , Arab roads and roadblocks .
This hard and heavy reality on the ground is not going to be reversed by any conventional peace process .
“ The two - state solution is disappearing , ” said Mansour Tahboub , senior editor , at the West Bank newspaper Al - Ayyam .
Indeed , we are at a point now where the only thing that might work is what I would call “ radical pragmatism ”  a pragmatism that is as radical and energetic as the extremism that it hopes to nullify .
Without that , I fear , Israel will remain permanently pregnant with a stillborn Palestinian state in its belly .
Why we need a radical departure is obvious : the business - as - usual course that Israelis and Palestinians are on right now does not have enough energy or authority to produce a solution .
With the encouragement of the Bush administration , Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank are negotiating a draft peace treaty that supposedly will be put on the shelf , until the Palestinians have enough capability to implement it .
I seriously doubt that the parties will reach an agreement , let alone have the energy to implement it .
I wouldnt ' say it 's sticking its tongue out , it looks more like a dog that 's just caught a frisbee and is staring at you all cockeyed and slobbering .
Dumb as bricks , but still completely endearing .
Much like the 300C , perhaps ...?

Missouri and at least 19 other states are considering passing laws that would force people to prove their citizenship before they can vote .
These bills are not a sincere effort to prevent noncitizens from voting ; that is a made - up problem .
The real aim is to reduce turnout by eligible voters .
Republicans seem to think that laws of this kind will help them win elections , but burdensome rules like these  and others cropping up around the country  pose a serious threat to democracy and should be stopped .
The Missouri legislature is , as Ian Urbina reported in The Times on Monday , on the verge of passing an amendment to the State Constitution that would require proof of citizenship from anyone registering to vote .
In addition to the Missouri amendment , which would require voter approval , Florida , Kansas , South Carolina and other states are considering similar rules .
There is no evidence that voting by noncitizens is a significant problem .
Illegal immigrants do their best to remain in the shadows , to avoid attracting government attention and risking deportation .
It is hard to imagine that many would walk into a polling place , in the presence of challengers and police , and try to cast a ballot .
There is , however , ample evidence that a requirement of proof of citizenship will keep many eligible voters from voting .
Many people do not have birth certificates or other acceptable proof of citizenship , and for some people , that proof is not available .
One Missouri voter , Lillie Lewis , said at a news conference last week that officials in Mississippi , where she was born , told her they had no record of her birth .
HAMPSHIRE , Illinois ( Reuters ) - As U.S. growers anticipate record returns for crops they are planting this spring , at least one sector of the rural economy is not enjoying the runup in grain prices : hog farmers .

High prices for grains , driven by demand for food around the world , means high prices for hog feed .
The price of energy , a major cost for farmers , has also jumped , and hog prices have dropped well below production costs for farmers all over the United States .
Economists predict that some will pare back this year and others will quit .
Smithfield Foods
Inc , the country ’s largest hog producer , has already said it is cutting production because of high feed costs .
But for Bill and Pat Dumoulin of Hampshire , Illinois , quitting is not an option , nor do they intend to cut back .
They rely on their business to support the families of their three adult children and to save for college for their 20 grandchildren .
Their hog barns northwest of Chicago are full and they are prepared to weather bad times , just like they did in 1998 , when hog prices plummeted to a 50 - year low .
“ We are in a down cycle but we will come out of it , ” said Pat Dumoulin , 74 , the matriarch and bookkeeper of the operation .
Instead of cutting the number of hogs , the Dumoulins are looking to cut costs .
They already slashed electricity use by two - thirds in one barn just by installing more efficient lights .
They also will be adjusting hog feeding units to reduce feed spillage .
“ The first thing you try to do when you come into a down market is look at where are you going to cut costs , ” said her son , Patrick , 47 , who with his brother Michael , 48 , oversees much of the operation .
ECONOMIC COST
The Dumoulins were not prepared to put a figure on their production costs , but according to agricultural economist Ron Plain of the University of Missouri , at current corn , electricity and diesel prices , it costs about $ 54 to produce 100 pounds of pork .
With live hogs selling at $ 40 per 100 pounds ( 45 kilograms ) in Midwest markets , producers are losing about $ 35 on each 250 pound market hog .
If these trends continue , those figures would be mean a loss of more than $ 1 million a year for a midsized operation producing 30,000 hogs .
Plain predicts producers will lose money throughout 2008 and much of 2009 .
Steve Meyer , an economist at Paragon Economics in Des Moines , Iowa , said the losses could be worse than those experienced in 1998 , largely because feed and fuel costs are much higher now .
“ There will be some people going out of business , ” Meyer said .
Part of the problem is a production glut that resulted from an expansion in the past five years , when hog prices were profitable .
“ Things are not going to get a whole lot better until we raise fewer hogs , ” said Plain .
The Dumoulins , like other producers , expanded during those good times , adding 800 sows for a total of 2,000 .
They can now produce and market about 40,000 slaughter hogs a year .
“ It was prompted by a large family and because college is coming , ” Bill Dumoulin , 79 , said , explaining how the needs of his grandchildren drove his expansion .
“ We needed to find sources of income to put them through school . ”
These extra hogs as well as those from other producers are hitting the market now .
On March 28 , the U.S. Agriculture Department reported nearly 65.91 million hogs were on U.S. farms as of March 1 , up 7 percent from a year earlier and the most ever for that date .
Those numbers are boosted by hogs from Canada , where feed prices are even higher than in the United States and where producers are liquidating herds .
In a report on April 2 , the department said 2.88 million hogs came into the country from Canada in the first three months of this year , or more than 4 percent of the U.S. total .
While this oversupply has resulted in an abundance of pork , prices in U.S. supermarkets have not changed much .
Pork prices averaged $ 2.82 - 1/2 a pound ( $ 6.23 per kilogram ) in February , the latest monthly average available , compared with $ 2.797 a year ago , according to U.S. Agriculture Department data .
BET ON FUTURE
The Dumoulins have faith in predictions that cheap hogs will not last beyond next year , as high - priced feed and fuel force farmers to cut production , reducing supply and pushing up meat prices .
If they cut back now , it would take them too long to build up when prices return , they reason .
“ Pork is the most eaten meat in the world and that is not going to go away , ” said Pat Dumoulin .
The United States is exporting more pork than ever , sending it to places China , Japan , Mexico , Russia , and South Korea , bolstered by a weak dollar .
The Agriculture Department on Wednesday estimated a record 3.735 billion pounds of U.S. pork will be exported in 2008 , up 19 percent from 3.138 billion pounds for 2008 .
“ Our exports are great .
If not , the hog market would probably be in that $ 8 to $ 9 area , ” Pat Dumoulin said , referring to the price per 100 pounds for live hogs .
One of the main problems facing hog farmers is the high price of corn , which have surpassed $ 6 per bushel on the Chicago futures market .
That is the highest price ever for corn and up from $ 3.70 a year earlier .
The Dumoulins , whose family has farmed this land for 100 years , produce much of the corn that they feed their pigs , but they still have to buy about 300,000 bushels a year .
Their last purchase was at $ 5.31 per bushel .
Last fall they bought some at $ 4.78 .
“ We should have bought more , ” lamented Patrick .
While many people blame high corn prices on U.S. subsidies that encourage the production and use of the biofuel ethanol , which in the United States is made largely from corn , Pat Dumoulin sees it as more complicated than that .
For one , she notes that corn exports have increased .
The United States has sold nearly 53.53 million metric tons of last fall ’s harvest to foreign buyers , up 26 percent from the year - earlier period .
She also notes that the cheap dollar has accelerated overseas demand for corn , just as it has for pork .
And , a growing middle class worldwide is buying more food and using more fuel to drive cars .
“ There is the cheap dollar .
We have a growing middle class all over the world . ”
Authorised Facebook Scrabble was launched in North America last week
Hasbro , which owns the rights to Scrabble in North America , is suing the Calcutta - based founders of Scrabulous - a game available on Facebook .
Last week , an official version of Scrabble was released for Facebook users in Canada and the US .
Hasbro said that Scrabulous violates its copyright and trademarks and has separately asked Facebook to block it .
The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York against the brothers Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla .
Scrabulous has been one of the most popular activities on Facebook .
The social networking site has so far declined to take down the application , which could mean it too is vulnerable to copyright action .
" Over the past year , Facebook has tried to use its status as neutral platform provider to help the parties come to an amicable agreement , " the company said in a statement .
" We 're disappointed that Hasbro has sought to draw us into their dispute . "
Rights to Scrabble outside the US are owned by Mattel , which is not involved in the legal action .
Mattel is planning its own Facebook Scrabble game .
Jury clears former Galveston photographer | Chron.com – Houston Chronicle
I was pleased today to see an article about photographer Nick Adams being cleared by a Galveston jury of misdemeanor charges of interfering with police while photographing an arrest at a Mardi Gras celebration in 2007 .
While I ’m amazed that any prosecutor would actually take this kind of a case to trial ( in this case prosecutor April Powers ) , I ’m pleased that a jury had the common sense to dismiss the charges .
In this case Galveston police charged that Adams had entered their roped off perimeter in order to get his shots which resulted in the arrest and charges .
Conveniently , and not surprising to me , police deleted some of Adam ’s photos while they had him in custody which would have proved he was outside the perimeter established by the police .
According to Adams ’ defense attorney , the digital index from his camera showed that these photos were deleted .
Personally I ’d like to see these cops punished for deleting someone ’s digital camera photos while he was in custody and for arresting him in the first place .
Police brutality is a fact of life .
While I believe the overwhelming majority of cops are good cops and have many friends and family who are cops , history has shown that there are still plenty of bad apples out there .
In a world where Rodney King can be half beaten to death by police officers , our right to be able to document police activity is a fundamental protection against police brutality .
When cops , who are trusted with extraordinary powers of authority , try to silence photographers this is a terrible affront on a free press and a free society .
I hope at minimum that Adams files a civil suit against the Galveston Police Department and that they end up paying monetarily for the bad behavior of the officers in question .
Police need to be sent a message that they cannot abuse photographers and get away with it .
Last month two brothers who sued Harris County were awarded almost $ 2 million after they were wrongfully arrested for videotaping a drug raid on a neighbors home .
Their case also resulted in the resignation of former Harris County District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal when their suit brought forward racist and pornographic emails on his computer .

The Darfur conflict has killed up to 300,000 people , according to the UN , and has driven more than 2.7 million from their homes , some of them into neighbouring Chad , fuelling instability there .
It ignited in 2003 as a political conflict between rebels in the western region and the Sudanese government in Khartoum but it was fuelled by longstanding competition between mostly Arab nomads and African farmers for scarce water and land after years of worsening drought .
Herders who were once allowed to graze their camels on farmers ' land because their droppings helped fertilise the soil found themselves increasingly blocked by farming communities .
Some of them became eager recruits for the janjaweed , the Arab militias backed by Khartoum who have spearheaded the brutal counter - insurgency .
International attempts to broker a peace agreement have produced little in the face of a splintering of rebel groups and an aerial bombing campaign by Khartoum , which has hindered the deployment of a new multinational peacekeeping force of UN and African Union soldiers .
Meanwhile a 4,000 - strong EU force is deploying in Chad in an effort to stop the conflict spreading .
Some experts have argued that Darfur represents an early example of a new wave of conflicts driven by competition for land and water in a world of increasing scarcity .
High food prices , also a result in part of climate change , have also triggered unrest in nearly 40 countries .

AFIO Weekly Intelligence Notes
- Adolph HitlerDon Clark's Big Lie About Roland CarnabyI 'll try to make this brief .
Being modern Americans , both you and I have short attention spans .
That 's how stories like the following get memory holed .
We do n't pay attention .
On April 29 , 2008 , Roland Carnaby was shot down in the street by the Houston Police Department .
The capital crime he committed was running from the cops after a traffic stop .
When stopped the first time , it 's claimed that Carnaby produced ID identifying him as a CIA agent .
The offficer was told by his superiors that the ID was fake .
The officer was also told to find a reason to arrest Carnaby .
This brings up question number one : if the ID was fake , why did the cops need to find a reason to arrest him ?
Impersonating a federal official is already a crime .
At this point Carnaby , a man with a stellar reputation ( he was president of the Houston chapter of the Association of Intelligence Officers ) , drove away from the traffic stop and attempted to call his contacts in the Houston Police Department and the FBI .
Having no luck with that , he kept driving while the cops chased him through Houston .
Apparently Carnaby 's vehicle was disabled by the police in some manner or another or he just stopped .
This point 's a little unclear .
What is clear is that the police were enraged and attempted to smash the front passenger window after the vehicle stopped .
while exiting the vehicle and then shot again in the chest by another officer .
He was put in handcuffs and left on the road to die .
Do I still have your attention ?
Good .
This is where you need it .
A former FBI agent named Don Clark made this public statement about Carnaby : Before it 's shown why this statement is a flat - out , bald - faced , blatant lie , let 's see who Don Clark is .
According to Clark 's bio that was released when he went to work for Sharp Technology , Clark managed the FBI 's investigation of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
He was also in charge of the investigation of Achille Lauro attack in which Leon Klinghoffer was killed .
He coordinated and managed the investigation and prosecution of the dragging death of James Byrd , Jr. in Jasper , Texas and he was in charge of the investigation and coordination to locate FBI ’s top - 10 fugitive and accused “ Railcar Killer ” Rafael Resendes Ramirez .
Clark was also the special agent in charge of the Houston FBI office , a position he held until he retired in 2000 .
He 's a well - known figure in Houston law enforcement circles .
In other words , Clark 's no fool .
He at least knows who is who and what is what in Houston .
So , let 's recap .
Of Roland Carnaby , Clark said on May 2 - two days after Carnaby was murdered - that On February 16 , 2007 , Clark was a guest of Roland Carnaby 's Houston chapter of the Association of Intelligence Officers .
It was a formal dinner also attended by deputy director of the CIA James Pavitt .
Yet we 're to believe that a highly - decorated and highly - respected former FBI agent has no recollection of Carnaby 's name ?
At this point , it 's difficult to believe that Clark is telling the truth about not knowing Roland Carnaby 's name .
Why Clark is lying about his knowledge of Carnaby is beyond our ability to know .
What matters is that a highly - decorated and highly - respected former FBI agent has been caught lying about knowing a man that was shot down like a dog in the street by enraged Houston police .
What matters even more is that the media , the press , the Fourth Estate , has buried this story so far that it 's hoped that we short - attention spanned Americans will forget it .
This American wo n't forget it .
If this is how the police treat one of their own , how will they treat us when push comes to shove ?
A CIA agent is shot down by local police .
The national media stops reporting on the story the day after the murder .
A well - known former FBI agent lies about knowing him .
And he lies big .
Welcome to Soviet America .
Or Nazi America .
Take your pick .
By the way ... Roland Carnaby was buried on Monday , May 5 , 2008 .
There was no reporting of the funeral by any national media .

Nick Hogan Gets Letter from Teacher Accused of Sex Crimes Stephanie Ragusa
Authorities have intercepted a letter towritten by 29 - year - old , the Florida teacher currently in jail awaiting trial for sex crimes charges stemming from alleged sexual encounters with Florida teens .
Ragusa is charged with two felony counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor and five counts of lewd and lascivious battery , among others .
The letter , which was intercepted by Pinellas County sheriff 's deputies was not sexual in nature , and a copy was eventually delivered to Hogan .
Although Ragusa is barred from contacting any of her alleged victims , she apparently has broken no rules by contacting 17 - year - old Nick .
I wonder what mom Linda Hogan thinks about this in light of her romance with her own 19 - year - old teenage boy toy .

One third of young women who drop out of high school cite pregnancy and / or motherhood as the reason .
But in recent years , special schools for pregnant students have been phased out in favor of mainstreaming .
What 's next ?
I ’ve been working with pregnant
teen women and new teen mothers for several years now , teaching life skills
and voter education classes .
One thing remains consistent for all the women I work with : balancing school and parenting is challenging
work .
I am amazed by the dedication and commitment it takes for these
young mothers to graduate from high school .
One third of
young women who drop out of high school cite pregnancy and / or motherhood
as the reason .
So educators have been exploring programs to help
pregnant teens meet the demands of parenthood and while being a full time student .
In recent years , special schools
for pregnant students have been phased out in favor of mainstreaming
those students in existing schools .
The young mothers I know are
experts on the system of social services and programs .
They share
information with each other about Medicaid , food stamps , daycare , parenting
supports and transportation .
A typical week revolves around city
bus rides , day care drop offs , feedings , diaper changes , study hall ,
tests , classes and day care pick ups .
They return home to balance
homework with parenting only to wake up and begin the routine again .
Each one of these young women
wants to be a good mother .
They know that they will be able to provide
a better future for their family if they graduate from high school ,
but they also feel that , in many ways , school time is time away from
their child .
The present is at war with the future and time is
as precious as gold .

Abortion .
Parenthood .

When I read the recent Christian Science Monitor article by Ben Arnoldy Special Schools
for Pregnant Girls ? ,
I thought of the young women I have met .
The article covers special
schools for pregnant teens in Boise , Idaho , that are losing funding despite
successful outcomes .
It points out that the value of these special
schools depends greatly on the services provided and that those vary
by region and school system .
As school systems across the country
are opting to mainstream pregnant teens due to budget concerns and concerns over the quality
of education at the special schools , the impact of that on graduation
rates for teen parents remains unclear .
The Boise P school featured in the Monitor reported an 80 to 90 percent graduation rate and that 50 percent of graduates went on to attend college or junior college .
But the article also cites a lack of national data on P school graduation rates versus mainstream graduation rates
for pregnant students and there are no definitive national studies .
I decided to reach out to some
student parents for their take on special schools versus mainstreaming .
Stacey , a 20 year - old mother
of two , attended a special high school for pregnant students or " P
School " when she was pregnant with her first child .
Stacey ’s
first pregnancy was the result of a rape and she chose not to transfer
to a P school .
" I was in therapy and it
seemed that everything about my life had changed after I was raped .
I just wanted to hold onto something from my life and going to the same
school felt normal .
But everyone treated me differently even though
few knew about the rape .
People just assumed that I had gotten
pregnant by choice or by being stupid .
When I missed class because
of morning sickness my teachers did n’t believe me and I was n’t able
to reschedule tests .
My counselor at school was great and she
hooked me up with a lot of programs and Nurses for Newborns too .
But I felt very isolated
and embarrassed .
Support was there but I had to search it out
and that was a hard thing for me to do at the time . "
Stacey dropped out after giving
birth to her first child .
She missed a semester and did n’t want
to return , but decided to return after discussing her options with her
therapist .
Stacey returned to her mainstream school and struggled
to balance parenting with course work .
When she found out she
was pregnant again , this pregnancy was the result of consensual sex
with her boyfriend , she was resigned to having to drop out again .
" Going to school with one
baby was hard .
There was no way I could do it with two !
I was sure I had messed my life up for good and I went to my counselor
to sign up for GED classed but she said there was a P school near where
I live .
I decided to give it a try but did n’t really think going
to a P school would be any easier . "
Stacey , who graduated for high
school and is now attending Community College , admits that the P school
made all the difference .
She was able to attend school and nurse
between classes and she found the integration of skills classes into
the curriculum helpful .
" The best part of the P school
was that teachers and students encouraged each other .
And no one
expected me to drop out .
Instead people expected me to take advantage
of the program and stay in school .
So when I fussed about being
tired my teacher worked with me to adjust my schedule .
When I
ran into trouble with day care people stepped in with advice .
And when I had my baby people where there to explain to me how I could
make it all work and finish school .
I returned to a regular high
school and it was hard but I learned a lot about what I could do while
at the P school .
I owe my diploma to those people . "
But P schools are not the perfect
solution to the problem of pregnant teen drop out rates .
As Andrea
Lynch has pointed out , the P schools that were closed
by the New York City Department of Education at the end of the 2006 - 2007
school year had disproportionately low attendance ( 48 % , compared to
89 % citywide ) , poor test results ( less than 10 % of students passed a
required Regents exam ) , and low rates of credit accumulation ( the average
P - school student accumulated 4 - 5 credits annually , significantly less
than the 11 annual credits required to stay on track and graduate on
time ) .
More disturbing was the finding that may students reported that
they were forced to attend P schools because counselors and administrators
felt that they would be more comfortable .
There was a concern
that these students were being forced from mainstream schools because
administrators were uncomfortable with their presence there and not
for their emotional and educational benefit .
Lynch also explored grassroots groups that advocate for programs that support
and provide quality educations for pregnant teens and teen mothers .
These groups are built on a reproductive justice model that seeks to
empower young mothers even as it challenges society and the education
system to meet their needs .
Stacey intends to take up that
challenge when she graduates from college with a degree in social work .
" Everyone has the right to
an education and the right to choose to be a parent or not .
I
made my choice and found my right to an education somewhat limited .
Too much of my story is about luck and it should be about design .
If I had n’t graduated it would n’t have been good for my family and
future or my community .
When I get my college degree I ’m going
to work on this . "
With one third of young women citing pregnancy as the reason they dropped out of high school Stacey ’s help will be needed .
Since
some programs like the Boise P school report success while other
programs like those in New York City found major achievement gaps ,
research is needed into these programs to improve upon what works and
phase out what does n’t .
Evaluating the success of P schools versus mainstreaming pregnant students is a start .
The National Women ’s Law Center
is lobbying Congress to amend No Child Left Behind so that it will
allow for the collection of data on pregnant students and the Healthy Teen Network is heading up a three year study to
determine if P school programs with high graduation rates are also providing students with good academics .
These studies will assist in determining the academic value of P schools .
What
is also needed is a commitment to provide more support opportunities
for young parents and fund programs that we know are working .
If school systems phase out P schools they must replace them with comprehensive programs that assist student parents .
A lack of support programs does not serve as a misery - based
deterrent to teen pregnancy , but rather is a recipe for increasing an already daunting drop out rate .
China and Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution last night to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe and 13 of his henchmen .
The rejection of the measures , including an arms embargo , a strict travel ban on the leadership , and financial restrictions is a major blow to international efforts to force Mr Mugabe to quit the presidency .
Diplomats said the move sends an unmistakable signal to Mr Mugabe that the international community will look away rather than intervene to protect the country 's democratic institutions .

The British ambassador said the Security Council had fallen down in its duty to defend the democratic rights of ordinary Zimbabweans .
Sir John Sawers said : " The people of Zimbabwe need to be given hope that there is an end in sight to their suffering .
The Security Council today has failed to offer them that hope . "
The Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , said : " I am very disappointed that the UN Security Council should have failed to pass a strong and clear resolution on Zimbabwe .
In particular , it will appear incomprehensible to the people of Zimbabwe that Russia , which committed itself at the G8 only a few days ago to take further steps including introducing financial and other sanctions , should today stand in the way of timely and decisive security council action .
Nor will they understand the Chinese vote .
" The UN still has a key role to play in supporting African efforts to bring an end to this crisis , and we will continue to press for the appointment of a UN envoy . "
The US ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , expressed disappointment and said he found it " disturbing " that China joined with Russia .
Mr Mugabe lost the first round of the presidential election to Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , last March , with official results giving Mr Tsvangirai less than the 50 per cent share needed to avoid a run-off .
But the opposition withdrew from the second round after many of its supporters were assaulted and murdered by Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF supporters .
While international criticism of Zimbabwe has been shrill , several council members expressed reservations about imposing sanctions .
South Africa 's ambassador to the UN argued strongly against the move .
The South African leader , Thabo Mbeki , reportedly told G8 leaders this week that UN sanctions could lead to civil war .
Russia 's UN ambassador , Vitaly Churkin , said that sanctions would have taken the UN beyond its mandate by " artificially elevating them to the level of a threat " to international peace and security .

China 's UN ambassador , Wang Guangya , whose nation is one of Zimbabwe 's major trading partners , also expressed fears of nation - tinkering and said Zimbabwe was best left to conduct its own talks on how to resolve its political crisis .
" The development of the situation in Zimbabwe until now has not exceeded the context of domestic affairs , " he said .
" It will unavoidably interfere with the negotiation process . "
The veto occurred as talks were taking place between Zanu - PF and the MDC in the South African capital , Pretoria .
The African Union wants the government and opposition to form an administration of national unity and last week Mr Mugabe accepted the need for talks .
But he insisted the opposition recognise him as President first .
Mr Tsvangirai has refused to join talks with Mr Mugabe and Mr Mbeki at Zimbabwe 's State House , saying it would amount to recognising his rival as President when he had stolen the election .
The MDC has also set pre-conditions before formal talks can open , calling for an end to violence against its supporters and the release of 1,500 political prisoners .
And Mr Tsvangirai has demanded an expanded mediation team that includes a permanent AU envoy .

Record Lightning Storm Hits California Following Legalized Gay Marriage
by Charles Coughlin
A Washington Post article reports “ Firefighters continued to battle nearly 850 wildfires in Northern California yesterday .
The blazes were sparked by what one state official called an ‘ unprecedented ’ lightning storm over the weekend in which more than 5,000 lightning strikes were recorded .
Crews from Utah and Nevada have been called in to help fight the fires , which have blackened thousands of acres and threaten thousands of homes . ”
Just how unusual is this ?
State records indicate the number of lightning - caused fires was 223 for the most recent year published ( 2004 ) .
And for 20 years of records the largest total number of lightning - caused fires for an entire year was 733 .
So in just one storm , a record number of fires has been set .
The total number of lightning strikes for this storm “ more than 5,000 ″ is equally impressive .
Curiously , this fantastic amount of lightning took place the week after a California court legalized Gay Marriage .
California is the second state in the US ( after Massachusetts ) to legalize same - sex marriages .
Just one week ago , a Reuters article reported " California begins marrying gay and lesbian couples on Monday afternoon in a step likely to challenge other states where laws define marriage as only between a man and a woman .
A state Supreme Court decision last month overturning a ban on gay marriage has already produced one major change : marriage licenses will no longer list bride and groom but rather Party A and Party B . "

Could a curiously - timed record display of lightning be a sign from God ?
Many Americans may remember the ancient story of Sodom and Gomorrah .
One Internet source notes “ According to Genesis , Sodom and Gomorrah were two cities destroyed by God .
For the sins of their inhabitants Sodom , Gomorrah , … were destroyed by ‘ brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven ’ ( Genesis 19:24 - 25 ) … In Genesis 18 , God informs Abraham that he plans to destroy the city of Sodom because of its wickedness .
Abraham pleads with God not to destroy Sodom , and God agrees that he would not destroy the city if there were 50 righteous people in it , then 45 , then 30 , then 20 , or even ten righteous people .
The Lord ’s two angels only found one righteous person living in Sodom , Abraham ’s nephew Lot.
Consequently , God destroyed the city .
In the Tanach version , Genesis 19: 4 - 5 , the final episode in the story of Sodom is described as the angels visit Lot to warn him to flee …
As they made their escape the angels commanded that Lot and his family not look back under any circumstance .
However as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with fire and brimstone by God , Lot ’s wife looked back longingly at the city , and she was instantly transformed into a pillar of salt .
In Ezekiel 16:48 - 50 God accuses Jerusalem of being worse than Sodom .
He explains that the sin of Sodom was that ‘ She and her daughters were arrogant , overfed and unconcerned ; they did not help the poor and needy .
They were haughty and did detestable things before me . ’ ”
This is definitely an historic low in the history of western civilization .
A major state in the US has legalized behavior , which has been viewed as an abomination for thousands of years by civilized society .
I ’m sure a parade of arrogant atheists , Jews and liberals will insist that it ’s inconceivable that there could this fantastic lightning display and record number of fires could be a “ sign from God . ”
To me , this sort of attitude reminds me of the arrogant and unconcerned nature of the residents of Sodom , who happily co-existed with all sorts of perversity and who repeatedly showed contempt for God and His laws .

An unrelated co-incidence , just like all the other crackpot interpretations of " end of days " and " raptures " erroneously predicted by the believers every few years , and they are legion !

This was the dramatic scene as the world 's largest statue of Jesus was hit by lightning .
The bolt parted the thunderclouds over Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , to strike Christ the Redeemer .
The statue is 130ft tall , is made of 700 tons of reinforced concrete and stands atop the 2,296ft Corcovado mountain overlooking the city .
Scroll down for more ...
It was named one of the new Seven Wonders of the World in 2007 .
Sunday 's storm caused havoc in Rio , felling trees in several neighbourhoods - but did not damage the statue .
This amazing photograph gives whole new meaning to the phrase " May God strike me with lightning if ... "
From the BBC :
The largest numbers of victims come from the poorest backgrounds and are women who have rejected their husbands , employers or would - be boyfriends .
The attack is not committed in a fit of anger or " passion " as is popularly believed but is premeditated and intended to kill or maim .
Mamata 's story goes back 12 years , to when she was 14 .
Her crime was that she refused to stay with a husband who had decided to marry again .
Over several months , while she stayed with her parents , he coaxed , threatened and tried to persuade her , but to no avail .
One day catching up with her as she headed for work , he suggested she come and sit for a while in the quiet , secluded park en route .
Then as she made to leave he grabbed her hands and threw acid over her face and arms , leaving her permanently scarred .
Twelve years on , she tries to live as normal a life as she can , though in a society where looks are everything , especially for women , getting a job , even as a domestic help , can be difficult .
One school teacher , scarred by acid , had to quit her job because the children found her frightening .
Most employers will not accept acid victims back , punishing them for a crime committed by someone else .
The National Commission of Women has of late begun to look into the possibility of a medical scheme for acid victims .
The numerous surgeries and skin grafts take decades to do and cost several thousand pounds which the victims are mostly unable to afford ....
Cases of acid attack are regularly reported in the newspapers , but the government institutions and even NGOs are only just beginning to wake - up to the issue .
So as yet there are no countrywide figures for acid victims , let alone insurance or rehabilitation schemes for them .
However , a pressure group , the Campaign and Struggle Against Acid Attacks ( CSAAAW ) , has been launched in the southern Indian state of Karnataka to increase awareness .
The group has put together a list of more than 56 victims in the state alone .
And while some might see this as evidence that it is just a Karnataka issue , the growing numbers reported by the media point to the fact that too many others are silent victims all over the country .
For many like Mamata , injustice continues in the courts - her husband is still out on bail , the father of two children , while she has nothing but her scars .
The Future of Freedom Foundation posted online today this piece from the April issue of Freedom Daily –
THE CAPSIZING OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
by James Bovard
American democracy is capsizing as a result of the vast increase in the number of government dependents and government employees .
This has created a voting bloc that overwhelms every other potential force .
H.L. Mencken quipped in the 1930s that the New Deal divided America into “ those who work for a living and those who vote for a living ” — a division truer now than ever before .
In the era of the Founding Fathers , few things were more dreaded than “ dependency ” — not being one ’s own man , not having a truly independent will because of reliance on someone or something else to survive .
One of the glories of America was the possibility that common people could become self - reliant with hard work and discipline .
Prof. John Philip Reid , the author of The Concept of Liberty in the Age of the American Revolution , summarized 18th - century political thinking : “ Property was independence ; lack of property was servility , even servitude … .
A man without independent wealth could easily be bought and bribed .
A man of property had a will of his own . ”
This was part of the reason that many of the states initially required a property qualification for voters .
Sir William Blackstone , whose work on the English constitution profoundly influenced Americans , observed that a property qualification for suffrage was necessary because if the property - less “ had votes , they would be tempted to dispose of them under some undue influence or other . ”
Thomas Jefferson warned , “ Dependence begets subservience and venality , suffocates the germ of virtue , and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition . ”
But in modern times , dependency is the highest political good — at least for politicians .
Since the 1930s , politicians have striven to leave no vote unbought .
Government aid programs have been endlessly expanded , and the government has sought to maximize the number of people willing to accept handouts .
Government aid has become redefined as a symbol of self - actualization .
Americans ’ dependency on government is soaring .
Federal social programs have continued expanding in recent decades despite bipartisan rhetoric about rolling back government spending .
The Heritage Foundation created an Index of Dependency to measure the rising number of Americans reliant on government .
The index gauges “ the pace at which federal government services and programs have been growing in areas in which private or community - based services and programs exist or have existed to address the same or nearly the same needs . ”
The index is based on housing aid , healthcare and welfare assistance , retirement income , and subsidies for college and other post - secondary education .
While private programs were judged by how much they actually helped people , the “ success ” of government programs “ is frequently measured by the growth of the aid program rather than its outcome . ”
The Index has a benchmark of 100 for 1980 ; by 2005 , the index reading had risen to 212 , signaling more than a doubling of overall dependency on the federal government over the prior quarter century .
As a result of the expansion of government “ aid ” programs into one area after another , subservience rather than initiative is becoming the ticket to prosperity .
Now , roughly half of all Americans are dependent on the government , either for handouts , pensions , or paychecks .
Most voters no longer seem concerned about leashing government .
Instead , many if not most are primarily concerned with directing the sludge of government benefits in their direction .
Voters want to unleash politicians to give them more benefits .
When government is viewed as a fount of benefits , limits on government power will appear to be self - deprivation .
The more people expect from government , the more biased they become against limiting government power .
This was stark in the 1980s debates over a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget .
The most vehement opponents were organized groups representing senior citizens , government employees such as teachers , and others who rely on government checks to pay the bills .
The key question for many voters is :
How much is the candidate offering for my vote ?
Elections routinely degenerate into “ an advance auction sale of stolen goods , ” in Mencken ’s apt phrase .
There is vastly more interest during election campaigns in Social Security handouts and policies than in Justice Department cover-ups and FBI abuses .
A political auction
Sums spent on government vote - buying usually dwarf all private campaign expenditures .
Incumbents perennially use the machinery of state to bombard voters with government handouts , often on the flimsiest pretexts .
President Clinton turned the Federal Emergency Management Agency into a permanent part of his reelection campaign .
FEMA now routinely blankets residents of swing states with lavish checks for dubious claims for damage from hurricanes and other bad weather .
Florida was a key swing state in the 2004 election , and thanks to FEMA and four hurricanes and storms , Florida residents received more FEMA handouts than any state in history .
The inspector general revealed in May 2005 that FEMA used a standard that would make a drunken sailor blush .
If someone called in and claimed his bed was damaged by a FEMA - recognized adverse weather incident , FEMA insisted on sending him a check to buy an entire new large bedroom suite .
FEMA did not require any evidence that a person actually sustained losses .
Instead , anyone who called deserved a check .
FEMA shoveled out $ 31 million in the Miami / Dade County area in the months before the election to compensate people from damage from one storm whose winds never exceeded 45 miles per hour .
More than 4,000 people received more than $ 8 million to rent temporary housing — even though they had not requested aid and often had suffered little or no home damage .
FEMA ’s handout standard is the mirror image of that used by the Internal Revenue Service , which has never set up toll - free numbers for people to call and nullify their tax obligations merely by asserting they have zero taxable income .
FEMA vote purchases are bargains compared with other ways incumbents purchase their job security .
During his 2004 reelection campaign , Bush often bragged about having gotten Congress to enact a new prescription drug subsidy for the elderly — which is now estimated to cost more than $ 2 trillion over the next 20 years .
Clinton had campaigned for reelection in 1996 by hawking a similar benefit , but had not been able to deliver the goods through a Republican Congress .
Prior to Bush ’s Medicare expansion , the record for the most costly reelection campaign may have been held by Richard Nixon , who railroaded a 20 percent hike in Social Security benefits through Congress and then made sure that each senior citizen received a personal letter from him along with the new higher benefit check a few weeks before the 1972 election .
Nixon also destroyed economic freedom in order to perpetuate his supposedly pro-free - enterprise administration .
In August 1971 , he imposed wage and price controls that were supposed to throttle inflationary pressures .
At the same time , the Federal Reserve boosted the money supply with a flood of new dollars — creating the appearance of an economic boom while federal controls delayed the evidence of inflation .
Nixon ’s policies helped cause international financial crises and the worst U.S. recession since World War II .
Democracy and dependence
Politicians have divided America into two blocs of voters labeled “ more deserving of others ’ paychecks , ” and “ less deserving of their own paycheck . ”
Between 1986 and 1996 , government transfer payments per capita rose at a rate six times faster than pretax compensation per private worker , according to economist Erich Heinemann .
The income of the elderly rose nine times faster than the income for average Americans from 1971 to the late 1990s , largely because Social Security benefits have increased far faster than average wages .
Democracy has also been undermined by the continual growth in the number of government employees .
There are more than 20 million government employees in the United States — more than the total number of Americans employed in manufacturing .
Not only has the number of government employees multiplied in recent decades , but the rise of government unions further stacks the political odds against private citizens .
Compensation expert Wendell Cox , publisher of the Public Purpose , a newsletter on government unions , estimated that pay for local and state government employees rose more than five times faster than private - sector pay from 1980 to 1998 .
Cox also found that federal employees receive roughly 50 percent more total compensation than do private employees performing similar jobs .
The sheer number of government employees and welfare recipients effectively transforms the purpose of government from maintaining order to confiscating as much as possible from vulnerable taxpayers .
Elections nowadays , instead of a vote on what government should do , are largely referenda on how much it should take .
The more government dependents , the more likely that democracy will become a conspiracy against self - reliance .
Not all government workers , or all retirees , or all handout recipients will vote for candidates championing big government .
However , politicians ’ ability to frighten and mobilize much of this huge voter base is often sufficient to turn elections into routs .
The danger of excessive dependency on democracy has been obvious for nearly 2,000 years .
Plutarch observed of the dying days of the Roman Republic , “ The people were at that time extremely corrupted by the gifts of those who sought office , and most made a constant trade of selling their voices . ”
Once a person becomes a government dependent , his moral standing to resist the expansion of government power is fatally compromised .
Every increase in the number of government dependents means an increase in political power .
Each increase in the number of government dependents means another person who sees limits on government power as a threat to his own personal well - being .
Anything that increases dependency on government undermines liberty .
“ Self - government ” becomes a farce when the citizen looks to the government three times a day for his next meal , while the government curtsies to the citizen only once every couple of years after often meaningless elections .
How can a citizen help steer the ship of state at the same time that he has his hand out for another government benefit ?

Senator Barack Obama claimed the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday night , prevailing through an epic battle with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in a primary campaign that inspired millions of voters from every corner of America to demand change in Washington .
A last - minute rush of Democratic superdelegates , as well as split results from the final primaries in Montana and South Dakota , pushed Mr. Obama over the threshold of 2,118 delegates needed to be nominated at the party ’s convention in Denver in August .
The victory for Mr. Obama , the son of a black Kenyan father and white Kansan mother , broke racial barriers and represented a remarkable rise for a man who just four years ago served in the Illinois State Senate .
“ You chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears , but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations , ” Mr. Obama told supporters at a rally in St. Paul .
“ Tonight , we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another  a journey that will bring a new and better day to America .
Because of you , tonight , I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States . ”
Mrs. Clinton paid tribute to Mr. Obama , but she did not leave the race .
“ This has been a long campaign and I will be making no decisions tonight , " Mrs. Clinton told supporters in New York .
She said she would be speaking with party officials about her next move .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
To friends , the idea that Craig Gile would end up in prison just did n't make sense .
He was the guy on the tennis court who went out of his way to correct line calls .
For most of his 44 years , Charles Craig Gile led a charmed life .
Honor student , captain of the basketball team , degrees from Vanderbilt and Wharton , medals for service as a naval aviator in Desert Storm , a Citigroup commodities trader with a cedar - shingle house on the Connecticut shore and a Christmas - card - perfect family - a lovely wife and three rambunctious boys .
Since last August , though , he has been Inmate No. 59449-054 , dressed in a dark - green prison uniform in a place he had never on his worst day imagined he 'd spend time : the federal prison camp in Jesup , Ga .
" This notion of a Club Fed is terribly inaccurate , " he said recently .
" That place does n't exist .
No golf .
No tennis .
No lobster .
No nice meals - unless you consider the bologna soup we had a couple of weeks ago a nice meal .
I live in an open - air cinderblock building .
Sleep in a triple - decker bunk bed .
There are six toilets .
Seven showers for 78 men . "
It has been a far cry from the life he was used to - barbecues and tennis , homework and Little League .
In prison , breakfast is at six .
Room inspection at 7:45 .
On Wall Street he traded complex energy derivatives .
At Jesup his first job was washing windows .
He moved up to teaching math , science , and finance classes to other prisoners , getting paid $ 9.80 a month .
Dinner is at 3 P.M.
The day is punctuated by roll calls to make sure nobody has escaped .
Each month a prisoner is allotted 300 minutes to phone home .
For Gile it has been nine months of shame and sadness , severe back pain , and homesickness .
" It 's been a horrible experience , " he said in one of two interviews with Fortune in prison .
" This will forever leave a mark on me and my family . "
In May 2007 , Craig Gile was sentenced to a year and a day in prison after pleading guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to one count of conspiracy to falsify bank records and commit wire fraud at Citigroup , where he was head of American sales and trading on the commodities desk .
Federal prosecutors accused Gile and his boss , David Becker , of overstating the value and understating the risk of their trading positions in complex energy - based derivatives in late 2003 and early 2004 in order to boost their year - end bonuses .
They had allegedly inflated their department 's profits by a total of $ 20 million , with the help of a broker in Englewood , N.J. , who was supposed to be independently verifying their calculations to Citi .
Is Gile guilty ?
That 's how he pleaded to avoid the risk of a much longer sentence .
He told the judge he was " truly sorry . "
But his real sorrow was that he had to give up what he desperately wanted : the chance to clear his name .
He had little hope that a jury would understand or accept his rationale for the valuation of complex derivatives , let alone that he could convince it that his efforts to fix the problem were a sign of his good intentions rather than a cover -up .
His lawyers warned him he could end up spending as much as five years in prison , not to mention $ 1 million on a trial , if he were to lose .
So after months of anguish , he took a plea deal , and on the last day of school in Longwood , Fla. , where he had moved his family , he fired up the grill on his backyard patio for an end - of - school barbecue and sat down his three sons ( ages 13 , 11 , and 9 ) to explain why their dad would be going to prison .
Following orders
He was following his boss 's orders , he told them .
He was probably too trusting .
He did n't know exactly what the rules were .
He used examples the boys could relate to , recalls his wife , Maureen - " Like if somebody throws a ball , and it cracks a neighbor 's window , and everybody runs away .
And she reports all the names to the police , then you 're in trouble too , even if you did n't throw the ball . "
His name is pronounced like " guile , " but any similarity seems to end there .
Recently , sitting at a folding table in the cinderblock training center at the Jesup prison , it is clear that Gile is a mix of sadness , regret , some denial , and sheer wonder at how things could 've gone so wrong so fast .
" I think there are hundreds , if not thousands , of traders who work on Wall Street every day valuing their portfolios , and they view it as being an internal bookkeeping function , and they do n't realize that they are at risk of ending up here . "
At sentencing , the judge said he was sorry too , but felt he had to make a point .
U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet ordered Gile to repay the bank $ 185,819 as restitution for the inflated bonus .
And a prison sentence was necessary , the judge said , to act as a deterrent .
" I regret it .
I wish it were otherwise ....
But I think you have been a participant in a culture about which one cannot be tolerant . "
Actually , it 's more complicated than that , which is why Craig Gile is more a parable than a criminal .
His is the story of a good guy navigating an especially tricky era of American business .
You could call it the wink - and - a - nod era .
Bosses want results but not too many details .
At what point does a stretch goal become a step over the line ?
When does adept managing become managed earnings ?
Seeing the distinction is made all the more difficult by extreme innovation and hyper -competition .
This is especially true on Wall Street , where it 's commonplace to trade exotic derivatives that are so illiquid they might only have one customer .
As a result , it 's also common for traders to book the highly subjective value of their own complicated and volatile derivative trades , despite the obvious inherent conflict of interest .
Wherever the line is , it was thoroughly trampled as every major financial institution , including Citigroup , ( C , Fortune 500 ) rushed to get in on the derivatives - trading boom .
The generals at those firms made clear that they wanted a big piece of the action , and the foot soldiers on the trading desks reacted accordingly .
When Becker also pleaded guilty , his lawyer told the court his motivation was not to get a bigger bonus but to make his budget and please his superiors .
" The type of conduct that got Craig Gile ensnared in the criminal justice system is conduct that I believe is in many ways routine on Wall Street , " says Roland Riopelle , Gile 's lawyer , who handles many white - collar cases .
The kind of derivatives that Gile was " attempting to value on the books of his employer are extremely hard to value and I believe are often overvalued by those who deal in them .
I think this is a common practice . "
As Gile was settling into his new job on the Citigroup commodities desk in 2003 , two countercurrents were in full swing .
One was a post - Enron crackdown on white - collar fraud that would eventually ensnare not just Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling but hundreds of other executives ( yes , hundreds ) , ranging from VPs to CEOs .
The other was the derivatives - trading boom that would come to grief a few years later , when securities tied to subprime mortgages came crashing down .
While banks have written off tens of billions of dollars and the Federal Reserve has been forced to inject billions to prop up the credit market , the captains of this industry , who led disastrous charges into derivatives , have so far suffered only damaged reputations - while collecting fat severance packages .
Gile , who took a step into a million - dollar gray area , went to prison .
" There are numerous banks and investment banks that have taken billions and billions of dollars of write - offs , and to my knowledge nobody has been charged with anything - never mind anybody going to jail , " says Gile 's friend Eric Blattman , a former hedge fund manager and now a private investor .
" When you look at the whole scope of things , what Craig 's accused of is like the fly on the back of the elephant . "
For anybody who knew him , the idea that Craig Gile would end up in prison just did n't make sense .
If it could happen to him , it could happen to anybody .
He was the guy on the tennis court who went out of his way to correct line calls - even when they went against him , says a tennis partner .
" I can see this or that guy getting caught with his hand in the cookie jar , " says John Maloney , a friend and neighbor who started the youth basketball league with Gile in Rowayton , Conn .
" But Craig 's just not that guy . "
There was nothing in his past that would suggest a career trajectory like this .
He was the kind of eager - to - please kid who left a trail of awards , report cards , and newspaper clippings that his mother , Jean , now sifts through somewhat painfully .
There 's Craig on the Biddy Basketball team in Norwalk , on the Orange Park All Stars , on the dean 's list at Vanderbilt .
" Everybody should have a kid like this , " says his father , Spike .
Craig loosened up a little bit at Vanderbilt , which he attended on an ROTC scholarship , joining a fraternity and playing the kazoo in the popular All Toy Band .
But as his friends went off to jobs or grad school , he left for Navy flight school in Pensacola , Fla. , and ended up a navigator bombardier on an A - 6 Intruder , flying 23 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm .
In a letter asking the court for leniency , a fellow pilot described how Gile chided him when he did n't want to take off again to refuel a stranded jet after having just landed on the aircraft carrier in a harrowing thunderstorm .
" Craig chastised me and reminded me that our friends were counting on us ' to get them some gas or they 're going to be swimming . '
He never once thought about himself . "
Marius Gedminas just wrote a post on memory leaks .
He could have used Dowser to find the leak more easily , I 'll bet .
Dowser is a CherryPy application for monitoring and managing object references in your Python program .
Because CherryPy runs everything ( even the listening HTTP socket ) in its own threads , it 's a snap to include Dowser in any Python process .
Dowser is also very lightweight ( because Cherry Py is ) .
Here 's how I added it to a Twisted project we 're using at work :
... from twisted .
application import service application = service .
Application ( " My Server " ) s.setServiceParent( application ) import cherrypy from misc import dowser cherrypy.config.update({' server.socket_port ' : 8088} ) cherrypy.tree.mount(dowser.Root ( ) ) cherrypy.engine.autoreload.unsubscribe()
# Windows only cherrypy._console_control_handler.unsubscribe( ) cherrypy.engine.start( ) from twisted .
internet import reactor reactor.addSystemEventTrigger(' after ' , ' shutdown ' , cherrypy.engine.exit )
The lines before ' import cherrypy ' already existed and are here just for context ( this is a Twisted service.tac module ) .
Let 's quickly discuss the new code :
import cherrypy and dowser .
You do n't have to stick dowser into a ' misc ' folder ; that 's just how I checked it out from svn .
Set the port you want CherryPy to listen on ; pick a port your app is n't already using if it 's a TCP server .
Mount the dowser root .
Turn off the CherryPy autoreloader , and the Ctrl - C handler if you 're on Windows .
I should really turn that off by default in CP . :/
Start the engine , which starts listening on the port in a new thread among other things .
Tell Twisted to stop CherryPy when it stops .
Then browse to http://localhost:8088/
and you 'll see pretty sparklines of all the objects .
Change the URL to http://localhost:8088/?floor=20
to see graphs for only those objects which have 20 or more objects .
Then , just click on the ' TRACE ' links to get lots more information about each object .
See the Dowser wiki page for more details and screenshots .
In an impressive mix of visual sciences and sci-fi , the ICT Graphics Lab at USC has created a low - cost volumetric 3 - D display that brings every kid 's hologram dreams closer to reality .
The process is not simple but can be defined through a few key concepts : Spinning mirrors , high - speed DLP Projections , and very precise math that figures out the correct axial perspective needed for a 360 - degree image ( even taking into account a viewer 's positioning . )
Different companies have been trying to create a viable 3 - D technology for years , but have found several barriers in their way : Small viewing areas , high costs and the viewer disconnect with blurry optical illusions .
The most recent attempts have included Helio displays that recreate 2 - D projections into floating 3 - D illusions , as well as Jeff Han ’s Holodust , which involves infrared lasers ' lighting up ' particles in space .
But the USC project is different and way more realistic .
When projecting video frames into a rapidly spinning mirror , close to 5,000 individual images are reflected every second within the surface area and come together to create a real - space three - dimensional object .
Because the images projected from the mirror jump out " toward multiple viewpoints in space , " the USC team created a formula that renders individual projections at different heights and traces each projected beam back to the display area to find the correct position of the viewer .
The system also updates itself in real time ( at 200 Hz ) , adjusting to the height and distance of the viewer , producing an image that will " stay in place , " ( or rather , that " adjusts its projected perspective . " )
In this way , every person in a room will be able to have a correct POV of a holographic image , like that of the TIE fighters in the image above .
It also allows for the correct image occlusion as well as the appropriate image shading necessary for each item .
More importantly , it enables simultaneous viewing – no one will need to use dorky , uncomfortable glasses to see them battle in mid air .
Ultimately , this breakthrough in 3 - D holographs is another key push toward the technology ’s inevitable conclusion .
It 's only a matter of time before our own Princess Leias tell us we ’re their only hope .

As you probably know , I recently finished writing a book with a few co-authors .
I kept notes along the way and wanted to describe the process for those who are thinking about writing a book , too .
Update : see the followup post for more of the story , including my editor ’s responses .
Update two , almost a year later :
Take this with a grain of salt .
I wrote it after an incredible marathon of staying up most of the night for months on end .
My take on it now that I have some distance from the project is — I ’d definitely work with Andy Oram and O’Reilly again , and I ’d be able to make the process a lot easier for myself the second time .
I think it ’s important to be objective ; my purpose here is to help prospective authors get a feeling of what it ’s like , and it ’s not all good ( but I ’d encourage people to do it anyway ) .
Hopefully I wo n’t come off as sounding peeved at anyone or like I ’m trying to put people down .
I ’ll have a lot to say about what went right and wrong , and how it helped and hindered the process .
Please excuse the rambling nature of this post .
I ’d love to write it well , but there is a lot to say and it ’s a lot of work to write a long post in an organized fashion .
In the beginning
Peter Zaitsev contacted me about a year ago and asked if I ’d like to help write the book .
In the earliest stages , the idea was that I ’d write a couple of appendices and help transform Peter and Vadim ’s writing into book - quality material ; I was to be sort of like a glorified technical editor .
At the time I did n’t know who , but I knew there would be a fourth author .
When Peter contacted me , I asked about the schedule , the outline , and what was complete so far .
At that point , there was an outline in pretty basic form — just chapters and headings , with a sentence or two to explain the outline in a couple of places .
The outline followed the first edition ’s outline to some extent , and the chapters on benchmarking , profiling , indexing , and query optimization were partially written .
The schedule was actually being slipped already , because the book was supposed to go to tech review in June of 2007 .
The proposal was to revise the schedule so that everything would go to tech review by October of 2007 .
I do n’t know when Peter started on the book , actually ; Andy Oram had spent years trying to get authors for the second edition , and I think Peter had started quite some time before I came on board .
He had then added Vadim and Arjen later , but it was clear that it was n’t going to meet the original schedule no matter what .
I asked the editor to send me the contract , and took a look at it .
It was pretty vague .
Responsibilities and steps to completion were not specified .
I asked a friend of mine who ’d written a book for Apress to review it for me .
I asked him what the process was like .
He described a process that had been exactly specified ; his contract had specified what he was responsible for and exactly what steps were involved in publishing the book , who would perform each step , and when they had to happen .
If he did n’t get his chapters done , he was not responsible for his co-author ’s .
O’Reilly ’s contract , on the other hand , was really vague .
I mulled over it , decided the proposed schedule was amusing , and decided to go ahead with the book anyway , bad contract or no .
I did negotiate to be a full author , rather than just being mentioned in the credits as originally proposed by the O’Reilly team , who thought I would n’t really be doing much work .
And I decided that to make this work , it was going to take a lot of time .
I spoke to my boss at the Rimm - Kaufman Group , and he was completely supportive of me taking time off work .
I went back to O’Reilly and asked for more advances on royalties to cover me working half - time , and that was approved .
I signed the contract and started working .
Actually , I may have started working first .
The tech publishing industry may work many ways , and I ’m no expert on it , but the most surprising thing to me was that in the tech world , you generally do n’t write a book and then go look for a publisher who ’ll print it .
It works the other way around .
Generally , they do market research , decide they need a book on a topic , and go looking for people who are competent to write it .
Especially for a second edition when the first edition ’s authors are n’t interested in being involved , I imagine this must be a challenge .
The process
The process of getting a book to print is n’t as simple as just writing it and sending it away .
We drafted material , sent it to the editor , passed it around amongst ourselves , re-drafted , re-edited , ad nauseum .
And then it went to tech review , and we got back revisions and comments ; then more revising and editing ; more writing , and on and on it went .
Ultimately everything passes final editorial approval and “ goes to production . ”
If you thought that was the end of the work , ha ha , it was nowhere close to being over .
There was a production copyeditor , then a production editor , a professional artist , proofreading , quality control , more proofreading , indexing , final quality control , revisions , and finally it went to press .
Each of these steps was a lot of work for me .
We were geographically distributed pretty widely , from California to London , Ukraine , Virginia , and Australia .
Collaboration was probably what you ’d expect : we never met face to face , though we did send a lot of email and we had weekly VOIP conference calls ( at 6:30 AM my time , late late night Arjen ’s time ) .
We used a Subversion repository O’Reilly set up for us to store the chapters , figures , etc .
And we used OpenOffice.org to write the chapters .
This was fine with me ; I was afraid when I started that it would be in Word .
I do n’t like word processors of any type , but I was happier with OO.org than Microsoft Word .
Using Subversion with binary files was n’t ideal .
By default Subversion does n’t lock files for editing , so it was possible for us to edit the same file at the same time , and OO.org ’s files are binary , so they ’re not merge - able .
We set the svn : needs - lock property on the files so only one person could edit at a time .
While that seems like a problem , there was enough work to do that I do n’t think we ended up waiting for other people to release locks more than once or twice .
Each chapter was in a separate file .
We had a few files of meta - data indicating completion , TODO items , and so on .
Here ’s a sample from our Status file :
4 Schema Optimization and indexing ( ch04-Schema_Optimization.odt ) * Baron has written nearly everything .
* Baron is waiting for feedback on one section .
* Baron moved redundant material to other chapters .
* Peter has reviewed and commented .
* Baron reviewed Peter 's comments and revised .
* Baron reviewed for EXPLAIN appendix .
* Sent to TR Jan 2nd. * Baron rewrote completely .
* Baron reviewed for grammar and readability .
* Peter reviewed again .
* Baron reviewed Peter 's comments and revised .
* Baron revised as per Sheeri . * Baron revised as per Igor . * Andy edited again . * Baron revised .
That ’s the final state of the file ; as we went , we had sub-sections in this text file indicating next steps , who needed to do what , and so on .
Predictably , at various points each section would be changed to say something like “ final draft complete ” when in hindsight it was probably about 25 % complete .
Back to the tools : in fact you can actually compare and merge files from within OO.org , but it ’s a crude way to do it .
OO.org was annoying in several ways ; it has a lot of bugs that got in the way .
Some were simple , like the way the find - and - replace dialog does n’t remember that you want to use regular expressions from search to search .
Others were more serious , and crashed the program upon applying style definitions , for example .
O’Reilly has a template , which has macros that help you format things with the styles they want so they ’ll be able to convert the files to their own formats later .
These were kind of clunky , and OO.org did n’t work so well with them in many cases .
I did learn some ways to use them better ; eventually I found various toolbars and dialog windows in Writer , and got them to mostly behave the way I wanted so I could write as I wished .
But there were still a lot of annoying things , like the inability to have an outline view .
I ’m not sure that OO.org ca n’t do outlines one way or another , but O’Reilly ’s custom styles were n’t recognized as outline - able heading levels .
When Andy edited files , he initially put comments in them using the Comment feature .
This did n’t work well .
OO.org ’s commenting and reviewing features , at least in that version , were hideous .
Finding comments in the text was really hard — there seemed to be no relationship between the comment order and the order they appear in the text .
And once I found them , I could n’t actually read them , because the interface does n’t even line - wrap them , so you can see only a couple of words at a time .
So I quickly convinced Andy to put his comments in the text instead .
He turned on Track Changes , which works pretty well , and I just had to review and accept them .
At the beginning , I had in mind that I would be revising and editing , not writing new material .
So I also began by enabling Track Changes .
But this made the program really sloooooow , and I found that I was a ) writing much more than editing , and b ) when editing , I was basically rewriting .
So I just turned it off .
There were a few times I worried that I was losing the original meaning , but asking other authors to review my changes was too slow .
The other authors had so much work to do that ultimately we were only able to get Peter to write the initial outline , review what I wrote from it , and in some cases review again .
I had to face up to the reality of this and come up with another plan : snip out the relevant bits that really , really needed to be reviewed and put them into emails , which are much less work for other authors to browse through and respond , but caused more work for me .
There are some other things that really cut into my productivity : you ca n’t split panes and see / edit two parts of the document at once ; and so on and so on .
I ’d insert figures and they ’d disappear after someone else opened and saved the file .
Ultimately I just coped .
Getting the job done was most important .
Revising , rewriting , and starting from scratch
The book was a second edition .
As such , technically we were revising and updating the first edition .
In reality we did n’t keep much of the first edition — just a bit of text and most of the outline and overall structure .
I want to be careful how I say this , because I do n’t want to criticize the first edition , but obviously our job was to make it better .
I ’ve heard people say they loved the first edition , and people say they thought it was not in - depth enough .
( For those people hopefully the second edition will satisfy . )
I actually found that except for the outline , I preferred not to refer to the first edition ’s material if possible .
It is much more work to rewrite than to write from scratch , unless the changes are going to be really minimal .
In a few places , we thought the changes should be really cosmetic ; those almost always ended up being a lot of work .
Oops !
The original idea was that Peter and Vadim would try to write the material , and then I ’d rewrite / edit ( and in some cases it would be Arjen instead of me ) , and Peter would review , and Andy would edit , and we ’d go around and around until it was done .
I quickly realized that this would not work .
Rewriting is far more work than just writing from a detailed outline .
I timed it a few times , and found that it takes about 4 times as long to rewrite and tweak text than it takes to get the paragraphs onto the page .
Prospective authors , take note of this point !
The “ final tweaking ” is vastly more work than the initial , satisfying process of getting the words down .
You can cut your work down by about 75 % if you keep working on more and more detailed outlines , long past the point you think you ought to start “ writing . ”
That ’s my experience anyway .
After some thought , I decided that it ’s because rewriting is sort of like reverse engineering and then re-compiling .
Let ’s take this for an example :
Good performance depends on both an optimal schema and optimal indexing .
Optimizing server settings can improve performance from a few percent to several times , but optimizing a poorly designed or badly indexed schema can improve performance several orders of magnitude .
This paragraph is not very clear , but it ’s not very unclear , either .
What ’s to be done to fix it ?
Well , let ’s see… you have to find what ’s good and bad about it .
What ’s confusing ?
I think “ from a few percent to several times ” is pretty unclear .
What are we trying to say here ?
Zoom out : what is the point of the whole paragraph ?
I ’d say the main points in this paragraph are a ) you need both optimal schema and indexing ; b ) settings can give a little improvement , but schema can give a lot .
Now we ’ll try to figure out how to say that succinctly , and what to leave in and what to leave out .
What eventually went to print was this :
Optimizing a poorly designed or badly indexed schema can improve performance by orders of magnitude .
If you require high performance , you must design your schema and indexes for the specific queries you will run .
Pretty different , huh ?
There were probably 4 to 6 revisions in between .
Here ’s another before / after :
Generosity can be Unwise A common mistake is assuming that since space consumption for short strings is the same for VARCHAR ( 10 ) and VARCHAR ( 200 ) , you can simply set the maximum length to some higher value .
In fact this has a severe performance penalty , because strings are often internally allocated as a fixed size object .
Thus VARCHAR ( 200 ) will use much more space in memory , especially for sorting or operations which use in - memory temporary tables .
The same thing happens with filesorts that use on - disk temporary tables .
The best strategy is to allocate the space you really need .
… and after :
Generosity Can Be Unwise Storing the value ‘ hello ’ requires the same amount of space in a VARCHAR ( 5 ) and a VARCHAR ( 200 ) column .
Is there any advantage to using the shorter column ?
As it turns out , there is a big advantage .
The larger column can use much more memory , because MySQL often allocates fixed - size chunks of memory to hold values internally .
This is especially bad for sorting or operations that use in - memory temporary tables .
The same thing happens with filesorts that use on - disk temporary tables .
The best strategy is to allocate only as much space as you really need .
This process takes an amazing amount of time , and though you may think it ’s an editor ’s job , in my experience writing this book , this was mostly my job , not the editor’s .
If I had n’t done it , either a ) the editor would have and I ’d have had to do a ton of work reviewing the edits ( this is no small task ) or b ) the book would have been lower quality .
As a result , we quickly scrapped the idea that Peter and Vadim would write a first draft and I ’d take it from there .
The several chapters that had already been written in this fashion were a mind - boggling amount of work to do , and I had to come back to them again and again .
Instead , I asked Peter to write detailed bullet - point outlines and fragments of thoughts .
This was much easier to write from .
Essentially , I was asking him to iteratively fill in an outline for me , which I now believe is a much better way to write this type of complex hierarchical material .
( I do not believe it ’s a good way to write a complex narrative , though ; this is not a one - size - fits - all approach ) .
I can’t find a sample of the rough outline anymore , but I think you get the idea .
Another thing that caused extra work was when the outline was n’t sufficiently detailed to start with .
For example , we initially lumped the chapters on replication , scaling , high availability and so on together .
It looked reasonable , but that ’s because we had n’t outlined in enough detail .
After beginning to flesh it out , it was clear this would be a monster chapter , and we split it apart — more work .
We also removed the “ Back to Basics ” chapter from the first edition , and ended up removing or moving a lot of material that was in the wrong place or was duplicated .
All of this was more and more work .
I would say that avoiding the temptation to write , and outlining in fanatical detail , is a very high - value activity for writing a book that ’s hierarchically organized like this .
Do not write prose .
The moment you start writing sentences , you begin structuring your thoughts in ways that create complex relationships between words , sentences , and paragraphs .
Teasing this apart and putting it back together is brutally hard sometimes .
There were times when I stared at something and just knew it was terrible but could not for the life of me figure out how to say it differently .
I had tunnel vision because I was locked into what was already there .
Quite often we wrote about things in some way that seemed to make sense , but then discovered that a few paragraphs or pages needed to be swapped .
The order in which we wrote things initially made the text flow a certain way that did n’t make sense after physically moving it .
Cleaning this up was really hard .
I ’d advise prospective authors to plan for a lot of re-jiggering in the outline , so outline in much more detail than you think you have to .
It ’s a lot less work to rearrange part of a chapter when it ’s in outline form .
At some point , when you get a large amount of text written , it ’s hard to keep track of what ’s where .
I found myself thinking “ I ’ve written about this somewhere ” and searching for it , but was unable to find it .
Later , I ’d be editing another chapter and I ’d see what I was looking for , but then I could n’t remember where the other place was anymore .
Sometimes I ’d used different words in the two places , so finding one by searching on the keywords in the other was impossible .
We had a lot of duplicate material in some places , and this was just really hard to deal with .
Part of this is because the book is hierarchically organized , and the old single - hierarchy problem started to bite us .
Things belong in multiple places , but they can only go in one place .
A good example is the server settings and status variables .
Should we discuss them in the server tuning chapter , or in the place where we show you how to interpret the status variables ?
They belong in both places , and eventually we ended up with some overlap .
Dealing with this is a lot of work .
I do n’t know how to mitigate this , other than with a good outline view — something lacking in OO.org .
Research
A lot of what we wrote about required deep research .
Some of the time it was enough to go look at the MySQL manual ( which is not always correct , so everything has to be verified ) , but just as often we had to go read source code or contact a program ’s author .
And occasionally , we had to run lengthy tests or benchmarks .
What I learned from this is that research can take forever .
You ’re either trying to understand something , or you ’re waiting on some poor programmer who has thousands of emails in his inbox .
Here ’s an example : what does avgrq - sz really mean in iostat ?
The man page is confusing .
It says “ The average size ( in sectors ) of the requests that were issued to the device . ”
To find out what this really meant , I had to read the iostat source , kernel source , and kernel documentation .
That took a long time .
Then I confirmed my findings with iostat ’s author .
We did a lot of research into MySQL ’s advanced features , such as stored procedures , the query cache , etc .
And a lot — a lot !— into InnoDB .
We especially wanted to learn how these features interact with each other .
For example , how does InnoDB interact with the query cache ?
That ’s not documented at all .
Each thing took a long time .
We also did a lot of benchmarking .
Benchmarking is time - consuming , too .
Plan for research to take much more time than you think it should .
Jay Pipes told me to plan for about a half - page a day , and I think that might be about right when you have to research much of the material on any given page .
Writing clearly
Working with the editor was an educational experience .
I knew I had weak spots in my writing ( and I still do ) but I did n’t know what they were .
I was determined that this book should be clear and easy to understand .
This is hard when you have a really deep , complex book — but it ’s even more important then .
As a result , I created a set of heuristics to help me find places where something needed attention .
It was n’t a perfect process , but it helped a lot .
Then I made a text file with regular expression patterns , and searched for matches .
When I found them , I thought about what to do with them .
Here ’s an example : the word “ only ” .
I have a habit of using it badly , and I did n’t know that .
But I learned , because I watched what Andy corrected , and noticed the pattern .
I added the word “ only ” to my text file of regexps .
Here ’s an example of how I use it badly :
Things belong in multiple places , but they can only go in one place .
( Hmmm , that ’s a sentence I wrote in this blog post ! )
Here ’s what it should say :
Things belong in multiple places , but they can go in only one place .
Ultimately , my file of regular expressions looked like this :
Passive voice : ( were|was|is|are |has been|be ) ( [ a - zA - Z ] + ) ?
[ a - zA - Z ] +ed \>
Repeated words : \<([a - zA - Z ] + ) +\1 \>
Confusing possessives : the ( [ a - zA - Z ] + ) of the Things to look out for : while |since| \< using |in order|of course|whether|allow|ensure|only|as ( we |you ) |without saying|obviously|clearly|needless|again , Finding pseudo - cross - references : ( ( Figure|Table ) [ 0 - 9 ] )
|TODO|XREF|MARK_
An awkward phrase that showed up a lot : \< by [ a - zA - Z ] +ing \ >
These expressions helped me catch constructions such as “ the tail of the dog , ” which can be shortened to “ the dog ’s tail . ”
Or something I noticed a lot from existing content : “ By using mysqldump , you can dump data ” becomes “ You can dump data with mysqldump . ”
( The last line in the file catches that one . )
I tried to make my sentences say , as plainly as possible , “ who does what to what . ”
If you ca n’t answer that question about a sentence , it ’s not clear in my opinion .
I tried to use shorter words when possible : “ allow ” can often be “ let , ” and as a bonus it usually turns a phrase into a single word : “ This setting allows you to … ” becomes “ This setting lets you … . ”
Phrases like “ of course ” usually alert me that I ’m being sloppy .
“ Of course ” really means “ this is obvious , but I ’m stating it anyway . ”
So why write it , then ?
However , far more often “ of course ” is a proxy for “ I believe this , but I do n’t know why and it feels hard to explain , so I ’m going to just imply that it ’s obvious and you should n’t have to ask me to explain it . ”
A lot of other phrases in my list are just mental bad habits I get into — such as “ in order to , ” which can usually be shortened to “ to . ”
Someone taught me that I use “ that ” too much .
“ She said that the pie was good ” becomes “ She said the pie was good . ”
Sometimes I take this too far .
For example , “ Someone taught me I use ‘ that ’ too much ” is overkill ; it needs an extra “ that ” to flow well .
The editor put quite a few “ that ”s back into the text .
Passive voice is an absolute killer — it confuses the reader , even if s/he does n’t notice , and makes it much harder to comprehend and retain what you ’re reading .
Here ’s an example I found with my regular expression : “ For some organizations this problem is solved using a combination of ” becomes “ Some organizations solve this problem with a combination of . ”
Sentence clarity is made worse by few things more than when passive voice is used by the author .
( You ’re supposed to laugh . )
No matter how good you think your writing is , prepare to put your ego aside .
An editor will always find ways to make it better .
After applying my heuristics to help me find the weakest spots , I thought I could do better .
I ’m a Perl programmer , right ?
Right .
So I grabbed a few modules from CPAN , wrote a little process to extract the text from the files and clean it up , and ran sentence analysis on the files .
I used several standard metrics of readability to analyze individual sentences and whole paragraphs : Fog , Flesch , and Flesch - Kincaid .
But these were not good enough , and the hyphenation algorithms were not good enough to measure the number of syllables accurately .
So I turned to the ultimate system for hyphenating the English language : TeX .
It has rules to hyphenate extremely accurately , with all sorts of special cases .
( “ The - rapists who pre-ached on wee - knights ” is a classic example of bad hyphenation . )
I broke sentences into syllables with a custom process to hook Perl into TeX ’s hyphenation routines through another CPAN module , and ranked sentences and paragraphs by the number of syllables .
Then I combined all of these metrics and created a report on which parts were the worst .
I looked at the top 30 phrases that scored badly , and found a lot of problems .
This was a valuable exercise ; it helped me get a fresh look at the text I ’d been staring at for months , and really did help me find the bad spots in the text .
But it was n’t enough , ultimately .
More on this in the next section .
From concept to completion
The high - level process to get a chapter to tech review looked like this :
Outline
Re-outline
Fill in the outline
Initial editing
Send to other authors for review
Revise
Send to the editor
Revise
Repeat , repeat , repeat …
That ’s roughly what it takes to get something ready for tech review .
Each chapter went to the editor or assistant editor about three times , and back to Peter at least once or twice .
Peter ’s revisions were exhaustive ( and exhausting ) and sometimes a lot of work to figure out what to do with .
He also added a lot of depth in many cases , which required rewriting and re-outlining .
( Remember my advice about outlining to an insane level of detail before beginning to write … ? ) .
All of these steps also took a lot of time , because it was a lot of work for Peter , too .
He was also doing a lot of onsite consulting , moving his whole family to the USA , and keeping Percona going at the same time .
I honestly have no idea how he did it .
At the “ end ” of this process , the chapters were reasonably feature - complete , but with large sections marked TODO because they were waiting on one of the authors , an “ external network call ” to Heikki or someone , or a benchmark .
Still , things have to go to the tech reviewers at some point .
From then on , the process was
Send to tech review
Keep working
Get back comments
Revise , wait , wait , wait
Get back comments from another reviewer , revise again , repeat till done Everyone has busy lives , and we did n’t get the first chapters to tech review until the holidays — the worst time to ask people to do it .
And there was so much to do that I could not possibly wait for all the reviews to come back before beginning to revise .
As a result , I ’d get back comments from Sheeri , and I ’d have to try to reconcile them against the edits I ’d made in response to Roland , and then Pascal ’s comments would come in and I ’d be up at 2 AM thinking “ why is he telling me this !
I ’ve fixed that already ! ”
This response was a function of how tired I was and how long I was working on this book , not how I really felt about Pascal .
We also did n’t make it clear to the reviewers that they were supposed to be reviewing , not editing .
I ’d try not to make this mistake again .
Some of the reviewers spent a lot of time editing grammar and style .
Unfortunately , this was wasted effort — the material was nowhere near good enough quality to be editing for style and grammar ( and the style is up to the author and editor , not tech reviewers ) .
It ’s also impossible to actually accept people ’s changes to the files — there ’s no way to merge 5 tech reviewer ’s changes together , so I only opened the reviewed files separately and looked back and forth between them and my working copy .
The edits added a lot more things I had to look through ; this is just the wrong stage to do anything but very high - level editing ( at the level of overall organization , for example ) .
The tech review stage is simply to check for factual errors or things that are technically ambiguous or questionable .
As you ’ll see , the editing stage was to come much later .
After the tech review and many more iterations of editing and revisions , the chapters were deemed ready for production .
There is no way to prepare for how much work it takes to get to this stage .
Well , maybe it ’s a function of starting with relatively low - fidelity material ( the raw content from Peter and Vadim , I mean — not from the first edition — some of the material was sort of like a hex dump combined with snippets from blog posts , post - filtered through an obfuscator ) .
Anyway , the most bizarre thing kept happening : I ’d mark a chapter as ready for production in the Status meta - file , and then I ’d go back and look at it and find all sorts of TODO notes that were not fixed .
I swear , I thought I fixed them all .
And many of them were a very large amount of work .
And I ’d have to admit to myself that the chapter was nowhere close to being done , and go back to work on it .
Finally , though , they all got done .
And we bundled them up and sent them off to production .
And for the 99th time , I told everyone the book was done .
And I was not even close to being right .
At this point , for the first time , I thought I kind of had an idea of what to expect .
I knew there was a production editor , and then it would go to a team who ’d transform it into some typesetting program , and ultimately to a printing press .
But still , no one really told me , even though I asked .
Anyway , hindsight is 20 ⁄ 20 , so here ’s what happened :
Production editor
Revision
Back to production editor
Revision
To the rest of the production team
The production editor was going to just check for spelling and grammar , right ?
I think someone told me that .
Instead , she went through the book in such incredible detail I could n’t believe it .
And she proposed major changes to just about every paragraph in the whole book .
She made so many changes that it took me at least a day , sometimes two or three , to review each chapter .
That ’s weeks of work I never saw coming — every weekend , every night , all the time — just like when I was writing .
And these were necessary changes .
She found every little ambiguous phrase , every contradiction between parts of the book , missing curly braces in code samples , paragraphs that belonged in other chapters , sentences that needed to be moved , commas in the wrong place , and much more .
She was an absolute editing machine .
Here ’s an example :
Remember , this is after the editor and the assistant editor have had about five passes through the material .
I really did n’t expect this much revision at this point ; I thought it was going to be just fixing commas and quotes in the wrong place .
She went through the entire book in that kind of detail — that is not a particularly heavily edited section , it ’s representative .
It was good that she did , but this was way more work than I thought I would still need to do at this stage .
This was made worse by the fact that the production editing process was done in Microsoft Word .
I do n’t have or use Word .
That would have been OK , but as I already mentioned , OO.org ’s markup and review capabilities are pretty limited .
The editor used markup comments extensively to clarify a lot of questions she had .
These are precisely OO.org ’s weakest point .
So I ended up using my wife ’s laptop , which has Word on it , to review the files .
This refreshed my memory on how buggy Word is — I would say even buggier than OO.org .
Word crashed I ca n’t tell you how many times , and the display and formatting issues were just ridiculous .
Sometimes entire pages were lost or scrambled .
I ’d see the middle of a paragraph at the end of one page , scroll to the beginning of the next page , and see some content that belonged much later in the book .
I ’d click something to insert a note or edit a change , and it would freak out and put my cursor at the very top of the file ; or just plain crash .
This process was much slower than it should have been .
I stand by my assertion that a word processing program is a terrible tool for writing a book .
But eventually , I got through it .
And then , after that , I was really done .
Right ?
Eh… no .
At this point I got an actual schedule of the remaining steps .
Copyedit
Copyedit review
Enter Copyedits
Conversion

QC1 / Proofread

Input QC1 edits / Pagebreaking
Back cover copy due to Production / Design
QC2
Input QC2 edits

Not all of this was my job , but I had to be involved in a lot of it , and that happened within a few weeks .
Would you like to guess how many of these steps required me to do a lot of work ?
Hint : I was sitting at my brother ’s college graduation reviewing the index to try not to slip the schedule again .
And I spent my weekends and evenings proofreading and making sure everything converted to the final page layout correctly .
Something else came in here .
The illustration artist did n’t start to draw the figures until after the production copyedit and QC mentioned in the list above .
What that essentially meant is that unlike the text , the figures did n’t get 10 or 15 rounds of revisions , comments , and reworking .
It was very much last - minute .
Fortunately , the artist was able to pull some really impressive work out of thin air .
Unfortunately , it meant one or two of the figures are not really that great — at least by my standards — even though they were really professionally drawn .
I mean , the content of the figures , not how they ’re drawn .
I ’d like some of the figures to present the concepts more clearly .
I tried to use figures to show what text could not describe well ; one or two of the figures could be better .
Alas .
Scheduling and project management
The schedule was never defined from the start , except for the unreachable goal of going to tech review in October .
Here ’s where I get a little unflattering .
I do n’t have any hard feelings , but I want to write about what went wrong .
I frequently asked people at O’Reilly to help me understand what would be involved in writing this book .
( This is why I ’m writing this for you now — in case no one will tell you , either ) .
It was as if they had never helped anyone write a book and had no idea themselves what it entailed .
As a result , I had no way to know what was realistic , and of course the schedule was a death march .
The deadlines slipped , and slipped and slipped .
To November , then December , then February — and ultimately far beyond .
Each time the editor told me he thought we were on track to make the schedule .
Remember , I did n’t know whether to believe this or not .
The amount of work involved shocked me time after time — I thought I saw the light at the end of the tunnel and then discovered it was much farther away than I thought .
In all fairness , I think everyone was shocked , including the editor .
He had no idea the outline he saw was so rough ( but he could have put more work into it and found out ! ) .
As we got into it , the amount of information that needed to go into each little bullet point expanded from a paragraph to a page to a section .
The initial contract called for 384 pages ; the book is over 700 pages ( and we actually omitted quite a bit of stuff so we could finish the book ) .
In contrast , the first book was 236 pages I think .
We did n’t know it was going to get this big .
Still , there was really a lot of room for improvement .
For example , I asked the editor to send the figures from chapter 2 to the artist in February .
And asked , and asked .
And it never happened , and ended up being a last minute job .
I asked , and asked , and asked for a counter - signed contract .
I finally got one about six months later , after asking maybe a dozen or 15 times .
Advances were late , too .
There were several instances of what looked like lack of project management from O’Reilly ’s side .
It seemed to me that the editor was heavily over - committed .
I tried to make up for it and do it myself , but you have to know what ’s involved in the project before you can manage .
On December 20th , the editor said “ I want this book in production in early February . ”
On January 10th , “ We should then be able to go to production late this month . ”
On January 17th , “ We might not be able to get the book to the MySQL conference .
I pointed out that this is not a time of heavy work in production , but we ’re cutting it very close .
But do n’t feel bad if the book does n’t come to the conference : it will be at Velocity which is directly related , and at OSCon . ”
That was a complete surprise .
In the space of 7 days , the story turned around completely .
Then a few weeks later , we got an email that said O’Reilly were getting a bunch of titles into production that they did n’t anticipate , and would n’t be able to fit ours in until much later .
Seriously , how can you not anticipate titles coming to production , when they ’ve been in progress for months or years ?
That led me to believe that none of their titles had good project management .
Let me be clear : the publisher is not why the book did n’t come out sooner .
A book is like a baby : it ’s done when it ’s done , and not before .
What I ’m pointing out here is that at no point in the process did I have an idea how far from completion we were , despite a lot of effort to find out .
There were times when I told the editor basic things , like the page count so far , and he seemed completely surprised even though I kept a file with a table of chapters and page count , and sent email constantly about it .
Even in March I was getting emails that said “ Because the page count is a little higher than we originally anticipated … ” and then “ You ’re right about page count !
The copy - editor says the Word files come to 600 without preface , index , foreword , etc . ” I do n’t know where all my emails were going — it seemed like everything I told them went into / dev/null .
Their lack of knowledge about the book ’s status was not due to my lack of telling them .
Another thing that was frustrating was the process of choosing technical reviewers .
It was never clear whose responsibility this really was .
I thought ( and still believe ) it was the publisher ’s .
I asked about finding people pretty early on , but my question just kind of fell on the floor .
So I asked again , and again ; I proposed a list of people ; I asked the editor to contact them ; I contacted them myself ; nobody would decide which of the people were actually the ones we wanted to use ; I finally made a decision and said “ OK , these people X Y and Z are the ones I want . ”
And then I waited , and after a bit asked about progress , and back came the reply “ maybe we should talk about who we should ask to be technical reviewers . ”
Pretty frustrating , but ultimately we did get chapters ready , so we had to send them to the reviewers .
And then the publisher sent the chapters off to the list of technical reviewers , but had apparently not really asked them if they would / could do the work .
One of them was upset , and wrote me to ask what was going on because he actually could n’t do it ; he was too busy .
I ended up having to apologize to some of my friends because someone else did n’t seem to have paid attention .
I ’ve talked to other authors and they said their publisher had the technical reviewers lined up before the project even started , and they never had to think about it .
That was not the experience I had .
Back to the schedule : ultimately my attitude was that it takes the time it takes , and any predictions I got from O’Reilly were just guesses .
But it would have been nice to have had more guidance about what I was getting myself into .
That ’s what a publisher ’s experience and wisdom is for , right ?
How much time did it take ?
I used Toggl to keep track of the time I spent on the book .
I ’d say I captured about 3 ⁄ 4 of the time I actually spent on it .
I tracked things by chapter .
I recorded just under 800 hours of work on the book ; so make it at least 1000 hours to account for the time I did n’t track correctly .
That ’s roughly equivalent to 6 months working on it full - time .
Here ’s a quick breakdown of the hours I actually recorded for each task / chapter :
01 27.83 02 42.75 03 84.28 04 55.33 05 69.42 06 56.33 07 36.67 08 67.4 09 48 10 11.47 11 64.22 12 15.18 13 30.07 14 17.15 A 0.97 B 11.8 C 11.67 D 5 general 143.22
I did spend several months at half - time work on my regular job , so theoretically working at least 20 hours a week ( but probably more like 50 ) on the book .
Otherwise , all of this time was spent on evenings and weekends .
It takes a lot of time , there ’s no escaping it .
A lot of things surprised me in this book .
For example , cross-references .
I tried and tried , but could not find a way to do them automatically .
Within a chapter , sure ; but not between chapters .
( Did I ever mention that I wished I were writing in LaTeX ? )
So this meant that I had to do a little system of putting a magic XREF word in the text , like this : “ See Chapter 10 for more on this topic .
( XREF : application optimization ) . ”
Ultimately , nothing was automatically numbered or referenced ; every cross-reference , figure , and table had to be checked manually .
And we re-numbered the chapters at some point , so it all had to be done again .
This was a lot of unnecessary work , but I did n’t see a way around it ; it was too late to fix it .
If you ’re thinking about writing a book , I ’d suggest you spend some time visualizing how much time it ’s really going to take .
You can use my hours - per - page ratio as a rough guide if you wish , but realize that a )
I ’m not the only author , so this book was a lot more than just 1000 hours of work and b ) I may be a faster writer than you are .
Unless you ’ve written a book before , do n’t try to estimate on your gut feeling .
A 200 - page book will take a lot more than twice as much as a 100 - page .
There ’s a non-linear relationship between pages and work , and pages that are going into print are going to take a lot more work than your senior thesis or dissertation , believe me .
Anyway , however it works for you , try to get a sense of the hours it ’ll need .
Now mentally visualize where you ’re going to get those hours from .
Really , how much time do you think you can spend in evenings and weekends ?
You still have to do all the ordinary things like paying bills and washing dishes , too .
Do you have a quiet place completely free from interruptions where you can work ?
Do n’t be surprised if you lose 15 or 30 minutes of flow every time you ’re interrupted .
That seems like a lot , but if you ’re keeping a lot of stuff in your mental workspace , and someone calls or pops in to ask if you can help them with something , you might find yourself becoming extremely irritable and impatient — I do anyway — and that feeling itself is as much of a productivity killer as the interruption .
Know thyself , as they say .
Ultimately , I think your psychological makeup is a lot of what determines how fast you can write .
So why did I do it ?
After all this work , I often joke , this book will probably make me hundreds of dollars .
I recently did some more rough calculations and found that it might pay back my royalty advances more quickly than I thought , but I ’m still not going to make nearly enough money from royalties to make the time worthwhile , financially .
I think if you look at the time I spent , I am working for less than minimum wage .
However , it ’s not about getting rich or getting onto the New York Times best - seller list .
For me , this book was a chance to do something I love — writing — and share / teach what I know , which I think is a good thing to do .
It also got my foot in the door as an author , so to speak ; if I want to write in the future , I ’ll know what it ’s about and I ’ll hopefully be able to make the process better for myself and negotiate more strongly in my favor .
It builds my personal brand , and may help drive some business to my consulting practice .
This is all theory , of course ; the better the book sells , the more likely it is that these good things will come to pass .
These days , since I ’m in high demand as a consultant , I also see the book as a way to help people help themselves .
There ’s way too much work to do , but people who buy and read the book will be able to get thousands of dollars ’ worth of advice for very little money .
In other words , it offers an alternative to people who have time but not money .
That lets me concentrate on helping the people who have money but not time .
Conclusions
This was a long , hard project that really opened my eyes to a lot of things .
I was n’t clueless about what I was getting into , but I still had unrealistic expectations .
There were a lot of learning experiences I would not have predicted , many in the area of other people not conforming to my silly ideas of what they “ ought ” to do .
The process was rewarding , and I would do it again ; but not right away .
The people who really took it on the chin were the ones I deprived of quality time , like my wife , family , and rock - climbing friends .
And my boss and co-workers .
The other major thing I was n’t prepared for was how much time it took .
Enough said .
If I write another book in the future , I think I ’ll be pretty well prepared for the process , and I ’ll try to make sure it ’s on my terms so I can be as productive as possible ( e.g. no writing a book with a word processor ) .
I think this is reasonable because the author is doing the vast majority of the work , so the process should really favor the author .
Finally , I ’ll make sure responsibilities and schedules are clearly and appropriately laid out .
Not everything can be scheduled exactly , but at least I ’ll know what steps are involved , who is going to do them and when as much as possible ( many steps can be scheduled relative to the completion of ambiguously scheduled things , such as “ after the tech review revisions are committed , the editor will commit the edited result within 14 days ” ) , and it ’ll be on paper with a signature at the bottom .
For those who are thinking about writing a book , I ’d encourage you to do it .
I hope my thoughts are helpful to you and that your book turns out well .
Postscript
As it turns out , the book was n’t done when it was done .
What remains ?
Errata , proofreading the printed copy so it can be tweaked in time for a second printing , and a lot of work to promote it .

A Manhattan man is feeling flush with anger after he says he was forced to sit in the bathroom for three hours on a cross-country JetBlue flight .
Gokhan Mutlu is now suing the airline for $ 2 million for having “ mortified , disgraced , degraded and shamed ” him by confining him to the can .
Mutlu says the bizarre incident happened Feb. 23 , when he was a standby passenger for a flight from San Diego to New York .
He was told the flight was full because a flight attendant was taking the last available seat , but was then told she would sit in the “ jump seat ” and he could have her seat , 2E , the suit says .
He was issued a boarding pass and took the seat , but got a rude awakening as he began to doze off about 90 minutes into the flight .
That ’s when the pilot called him “ towards the front of the plane , towards the cockpit , and advised the plaintiff that he would have to give his seat up ” to the flight attendant , the suit says .
“ The plaintiff was puzzled and asked what was going on , ” the filing says .
The pilot told him the “ flight attendant wanted to be more comfortable and that the ‘ jump seat ’ was not comfortable for her . ”
Mutlu “ asked if he was being directed to surrender the seat issued to him and to take the ‘ jump seat ’ for the remaining part of the flight , which was about 3 1/2 hours . ”
The pilot told him the jump seat was for “ for personnel only , ” the suit says .
“ Even more puzzled and perplexed , the plaintiff asked if the pilot was directing him to stand for the remaining part of the flight , ” it says .
The pilot said no – Mutlu should just “ go and ‘ hang out ’ in the bathroom , ” the suit says .
In the meantime , the stewardess took Mutlu ’s seat , “ closed her eyes and pretended to sleep . ”
When Mutlu began to argue , the pilot “ became angry at the plaintiff ’s reluctance to go . . . to take his place in the rest room and took a much harsher tone with the plaintiff , advising him that he was the pilot , that this was his plane , under his command , and that the plaintiff should be grateful for being onboard , ” the suit says .
Mutlu says he was “ imprisoned ” in the bathroom for hours , which “ seemed like an eternity . ”
He was ordered back to his seat when the plane ran into heavy turbulence , the suit says .
“ Plaintiff walked back to his seat embarrassed , humiliated , mortified , disgraced degraded and still shocked beyond belief , ” and tried “ to cover his face ” as he walked up the aisle , the papers say .
The flight landed at JFK around 5:30 am , and the pilot stopped him as he was walking out “ and asked if everything was okay .
The plaintiff replied , ‘ No , ' ” the suit says .
The suit seeks money for emotional damages .

Obama scoffs at idea of future Bush role in Iraq David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday June 12 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama was taking questions at a town hall meeting in Wisconsin when he fielded a rather unexpected question about who he might have helping implement his Iraq policy .
A questioner asked if Obama would send George W. Bush to Iraq , as ambassador , after the president leaves office .
Obama , who was sipping from a bottle of water , seemed to almost do a spit - take at the absurdity of the suggestion .
" Honestly , we need someone really good in that job , " Obama said , indicating that letting Bush anywhere near the country he willfully invaded would be out of the question in an Obama administration .
Obama continued to hammer his Republican opponent John McCain Thursday over the latter 's recent statement that deciding when US troops would be coming home from Iraq was " not too important . "
Obama noted McCain 's insistence that the duration of troop deployments was less important than reducing casualties and combat deaths , but even there , he said the Republican nominee was missing the point .
" The notion that if they 're not getting killed that we can leave them there in perpetuity -- a hundred years , John McCain says -- first of all that means he's not thinking about the extraordinary burden that families are under , on two or three or four tours of duty , " Obama told the crowd in Kaukauna , Wisc .
" But he 's also not thinking about taxpayers who are spending 10 to 12 billion dollars a month in Iraq .
And that 's money that can go ... to putting people back to work right here in the United States of America . "

Trade - Offs
A big part of design is managing trade - offs .
To crudely paraphrase a ( purported ) quote from Abraham Lincoln , you can please some of the people all of the time , all of the people some of the time , but you ca n’t please all of the people all of the time .
A simple trade - off between two things is like a seesaw : move one up and the other goes down .
Think , say , of buying a new external hard drive — the trade - off there is between higher storage capacity and lower price .
Or , say , how big to make a push button — bigger buttons are easier to hit , but there ’s only so much space on a screen .
Multivariate trade - offs are more complicated , but the basic gist is the same : you ca n’t have your cake and eat it too .
Brian Caulfield ’s “ Seven iPhone Disappointments ” piece for Forbes got me thinking about this .
There ’s a bit of a straw - man aspect to the way his list is framed — a “ see , even the iPhone is imperfect ” angle — but it ’s a fair list of iPhone criticisms .
And while it does prove that the iPhone 3G is far from perfect , it goes a long way toward showing just how strong a position it ’s currently in , and how well Apple has managed iPhone design trade - offs so far .
Here ’s Caulfield ’s list , with my commentary :
The Cost —
Yes , AT&T ’s monthly data plans for the iPhone 3G are more expensive than the original iPhone data plans — but they ’re exactly the same as AT&T ’s plans for other 3G smartphones , and very much comparable to the cost of smartphone plans from Verizon , Sprint , and T - Mobile .
The higher - cost data plans may give pause to existing iPhone owners considering an upgrade , but the iPhone looks terrific , cost - wise , compared to competing smartphones .
So on the one hand , yes , price is still a limiting factor for the iPhone — there are a lot of people who ca n’t or wo n’t pay $ 70 a month for a phone .
But on the other hand , this is true for all existing smartphones .
No Flash Support in MobileSafari —
I ’ve covered this extensively , but in short , it ’s a classic trade - off .
On the one hand , Flash support on the iPhone might be cool .
On the other hand , it ’d likely hurt battery life , would enable annoying ads , and would n’t work with any Flash apps that assume there ’s a mouse or keyboard present .
But the whole thing is moot because there is n’t any other phone with a web browser even nearly as good as the iPhone ’s that also supports Flash .
The iPhone without Flash only compares badly against an imaginary iPhone with Flash , not any actual existing competing phone .
No Replaceable Batteries —
What Caulfield really means here is “ no easily swapped on - the - fly batteries ” .
( You know a list of iPhone “ disappointments ” is getting thin when the swappable battery thing comes up as # 3 . )
Again , though , it ’s a simple trade - off : swappable batteries are useful , even essential , for people who burn through an entire charge in under a day .
But sealing the case allows Apple to design batteries in unique shapes .
User accessible batteries are , in all cases I ’m aware of , thicker , and the access panels are often squishy or squeaky or junky .
After a year of actual real - world iPhone use , it seems clear that the iPhone ’s unswappable battery stores at least enough power to get the vast majority of users through a day — just like with the iPod .
No Video Recording — I would love for the iPhone to shoot video roughly of the same quality as my Flip Ultra .
But taking a step back from video , I ’d also love if the iPhone could take still photos of the same quality as a standalone point - and - shoot camera .
But people in hell want ice water .
Image - quality - wise , the primary problem with the iPhone ’s camera is the lens .
It ’s crap — very much a mere phone camera lens .
There are other phones with standalone camera - quality lenses , Sony Ericsson ’s coming - later - this - year C905 leading the pack .
But better lenses are ( a ) bigger , and ( b ) more expensive .
To ask for better image quality or video support without acknowledging that it would make the iPhone more expensive ( and probably thicker1 and heavier ) is to ignore the inherent trade - offs .
No Cut - and - Paste —
There are times when I want to copy and paste something on my iPhone — usually a URL — so badly that it almost literally hurts my fingers that I can’t .
Not sure what the story is on this design decision , but judging by what we know about the 2.0 OS , if it ’s ever going to happen , we ’re still in for a wait .
It ’s a tricky UI problem given the iPhone ’s interface , but that it ’s still missing in the 2.0 OS strikes me as the one real head - scratching I - do n ’t - get - it omission .
No Multimedia Message Service —
See below .
No Voice Dialing —
These do seem like curious omissions , but the obvious answer is that Apple simply has n’t gotten to them yet .
You ca n’t keep adding features without pushing the release date for new software forward .
MMS and voice dialing seem like inevitable iPhone features , but neither seems like the sort of thing that would warrant delaying the release of the 2.0 OS .
( It ’s possible that the same is true of copy - and - paste . )
The iPhone 2.0 OS is in many ways a lot like Snow Leopard : not much different from the previous OS in terms of user - visible features , but significantly improved under the hood .
In short , if you want to know what to expect from the iPhone product platform going forward , consider the iPod .
Given how successful the iPod has been , I ca n’t see any reason why Apple should n’t follow a similar timeline with the iPhone .
The original iPod shipped in October 2001 .
The second generation model came the next summer , and the only signficant difference was that it switched from a moving click wheel to a touch - sensitive one .
Most notably , Apple did n’t expand to a second form factor until January 2004 with the iPod Mini .
Photo support in the fall of 2004 , video support in 2005 .
One new thing at a time .
In one year with the iPhone , we ’re getting three new things : 3G , GPS , and a full - fledged third - party SDK .
The iTunes Music Store did n’t appear until April 2003 , and it did n’t support Windows users until October 2003 , two full years after the debut of the original iPod .
So with the App Store coming just one year in , if anything , the iPhone platform is moving faster than the iPod did .
So , patience .
SXSW Showcasing Music Torrents

Mr Mugabe has been ratcheting up the rhetoric ahead of the run- off President Robert Mugabe has vowed that the main opposition party will never lead Zimbabwe and said he was prepared to " go to war " for his country .
He is due to face Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , in a 27 June run -off poll .
Mr Tsvangirai was released after being arrested for the fifth time this week .
Meanwhile , deputy MDC leader Tendai Biti appeared in court in Harare , where a judge is to rule on the legality of his arrest on treason charges .
Mr Tsvangirai has been detained several times on the campaign trail .
On Saturday , he was stopped with 11 members of his party at a roadblock , the MDC said , and held at a police station for three hours .
The MDC issued a statement saying that it was now clearly impossible to talk about free and fair elections .
Mr Tsvangirai gained more votes than Mr Mugabe in the first round of voting in the presidential election in March , but not enough for an outright victory .
Formal protest Speaking at the burial of a former independence fighter , Mr Mugabe said he would never accept the MDC taking over the government of Zimbabwe .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He described the opposition as " lackeys " and referred to Zimbabwe 's past struggle for independence from its colonial ruler , Britain , saying the country should not be " lost " again .
" We shall never ever accept anything that smells of a delivered parcel that comes through what they call the MDC here , " Mr Mugabe said at the ceremony .
" We fought for this country .
Now we have it under control .
After all that work , can we allow this country to be taken over by lackeys ?
That will never happen in our lifetime .
It will never happen .
" We are prepared to fight for our country and to go to war if we lose it the same way our ancestors lost it . "
Mr Mugabe stopped short of explicitly calling for war if the opposition won the run-off vote , but the remarks raised the stakes in his fight to hold on to his job , says the BBC's Peter Greste in neighbouring South Africa .
The Zimbabwean government faces growing pressure from regional leaders over the harassment of opposition leaders two weeks before the presidential run-off election .
On Friday , Botswana lodged a formal protest over the current actions of the Zimbabwean authorities .
Political violence Mr Biti was arrested on what police said were treason charges when he returned from neighbouring South Africa on Thursday .
The charges carry a possible death sentence .
Tendai Biti has not yet been formally charged with treason
He has not yet been formally charged but that is expected to take place on Monday , says the BBC's Peter Greste in Johannesburg .
It took an order from the High Court for police to present Mr Biti - who had been taken to an undisclosed location - to the court and give him access to lawyers , our correspondent adds .
At the time of his arrest , national police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said Mr Biti would be charged with treason " for publishing a document that was explaining a transitional strategy around March 26 " .
He said he would also be charged for proclaiming victory in the 29 March elections before official results were published .
The US ambassador to Zimbabwe said the US was very concerned about the treason charge and did not consider it justified .
Mr Tsvangirai says more than 60 opposition supporters have been killed in political violence since the March elections and 200 more are unaccounted for .
Mr Mugabe 's supporters say the scale of the violence has been exaggerated and blame the MDC for some attacks .
But human rights groups accuse the ruling party of being behind most of the violence .

Book Details U.S. Pressure On Allies Before War
By Colum Lynch
Washington Post Staff Writer
UNITED NATIONS —
In the months leading up to the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , the Bush administration threatened trade reprisals against friendly countries who withheld their support , spied on its allies , and pressed for the recall of U.N. envoys that resisted U.S. pressure to endorse the war , according to an upcoming book by a top Chilean diplomat .
The rough - and - tumble diplomatic strategy has generated lasting “ bitterness ” and “ deep mistrust ” in Washington ’s relations with allies in Europe , Latin America and elsewhere , wrote Heraldo MuÃ±oz , Chile ’s ambassador to the United Nations , in his book “ A Solitary War : A Diplomat ’s Chronicle of the Iraq War and Its Lessons , ” set for publication next month .
“ In the aftermath of the invasion , allies loyal to the United States were rejected , mocked and even punished ” for their refusal to back a U.N. resolution authorizing military action against Saddam Hussein ’s government , MuÃ±oz wrote .
But the tough talk dissipated as the war effort worsened and President Bush came to reach out to many of the same allies that he had spurned .
MuÃ±oz ’s account suggests the U.S. strategy backfired in Latin America , damaging the administration ’s standing in a region that has long been dubious of U.S. military intervention .
MuÃ±oz details key roles by Chile and Mexico , the Security Council ’s two Latin members at the time , in the run-up to the war .
Then - U.N. ambassadors Juan Gabriel ValdÃ©s of Chile and Adolfo Aguilar ZÃ­nser of Mexico helped thwart U.S. and British efforts to rally support among the council ’s six undecided members for a resolution authorizing the U.S. - led invasion .
The book portrays Bush personally prodding the leaders of those six governments — Angola , Cameroon , Chile , Guinea , Mexico and Pakistan — to support the war resolution , a strategy aimed at demonstrating broad support for U.S. military plans , despite the looming French threat to veto the resolution .
In the weeks preceding the war , Bush made several appeals to Chilean President Ricardo Lagos and Mexican President Vicente Fox to rein in their diplomats and support U.S. war aims .
“ We have problems with your ambassador at the U.N. , ” Bush told Fox at a summit of the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation in Los Cabos , Mexico , in late 2002 .
“ It ’s time to bring up the vote , Ricardo .
We ’ve had this debate too long , ” Bush told the Chilean president on March 11 , 2003 .
“ Bush had referred to Lagos by his first name , but as the conversation drew to a close and Lagos refused to support the resolution as it stood , Bush shifted to a cool and aloof ‘ Mr. President , ’ ” MuÃ±oz wrote .
“ Next Monday , time is up , ” Bush told Lagos .
Senior U.S. diplomats sought to thwart a last - minute attempt by Chile to broker a compromise that would delay military action for weeks , providing Iraq with a final shot at demonstrating that it had fully complied with its disarmament requirements .
On March 14 , 2003 , less than one week before the eventual invasion , Chile hosted a meeting of diplomats from the six undecided governments to discuss its proposal .
But U.S. ambassador John D. Negroponte and then -Secretary of State Colin L. Powell moved quickly to quash the initiative , warning their governments that the effort was viewed as “ an unfriendly act ” designed to isolate the United States .
The diplomats received calls from their governments ordering them to “ leave the meeting immediately , ” MuÃ±oz writes .
Aguilar - ZÃ­nser , who died in 2005 , was finally forced out of the Mexican government after publicly accusing the United States of treating Mexico like its “ back yard ” during the war negotiations .
ValdÃ©s was transferred to Argentina , where he served as Chile ’s top envoy , and MuÃ±oz , a Chilean minister and onetime classmate of Condoleezza Rice at the University of Denver , was sent to the United Nations in June 2003 to patch up relations with the United States .
In the days after the invasion , the National Security Council ’s top Latin American expert , John Maisto , invited MuÃ±oz to the White House to convey the message to Lagos , that his country ’s position at the United Nations had jeopardized prospects for the speedy Senate ratification of a free - trade pact .
“ Chile has lost some influence , ” he said .
“ President Bush is truly disappointed with Lagos , but he is furious with Fox .
With Mexico , the president feels betrayed ; with Chile , frustrated and let down . ”
MuÃ±oz said subsequent ties remained tense at the United Nations , where the United States sought support for resolutions authorizing the occupation of Iraq .
He said that small countries met privately in a secure room at the German mission that was impervious to eavesdropping .
“ It reminded me of a submarine or a giant safe , ” MuÃ±oz said in an interview .
The United States , he added , expressed “ its displeasure ” to the German government every time they held a meeting in the secure room .
“ They could n’t listen to what was going on . ”
MuÃ±oz said that threats of reprisals were short - lived as Washington quickly found itself reaching out to Chile , Mexico and other countries to support Iraq ’s messy postwar rehabilitation .
It also sought support from Chile on issues such as peacekeeping in Haiti and support for U.S. efforts to drive Syria out of Lebanon .
The U.S. - Chilean free trade agreement , while delayed , was finally signed by then - U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick in June 2003 .
MuÃ±oz said that Rice , as secretary of state , called him to ask for help on a U.N. resolution that would press for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon .
The United States had secured eight of the nine votes required for adoption of a resolution in the Security Council .
MuÃ±oz had received instructions to abstain .
“ I talked to [ Lagos ] , and he listened to my argument , and we gave them the ninth vote , ” he said .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Justice Department officials blocked liberals and people with Democratic Party ties from a highly selective program that funneled young lawyers into government jobs , according to an internal investigation released Tuesday .
A bias against liberals existed in a Justice program meant to hire young lawyers , an investigation found .
Esther Slater McDonald , a political appointee at the Justice Department , " wrote disparaging statements about the candidates ' liberal and Democratic Party affiliations on the applications she reviewed and ... she voted to deselect candidates on that basis , " said the report by Inspector General Glenn Fine .
McDonald , who has left the department , refused to be interviewed for the investigation .
The report , the first official investigation to document politicization of the Justice Department during the Bush administration , is an offshoot of the larger investigation of Justice Department politics triggered by the furor over the firing of nine U.S. attorneys .
It found two of three members of a screening committee considered political views and experience when choosing new lawyers for the Justice Department Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program .
The report found that McDonald and Michael Elston , the chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty , engaged in misconduct , an administrative violation .
The third member of the screening committee , career lawyer Dan Fridman , was cleared of any involvement in the politicization of the process .
Elston was interviewed by the investigators , who asked him about the role of former Justice Department official Monica Goodling in politicizing the selection process .
Elston told investigators he could not recall Goodling telling him to select lawyers who appeared to share Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' philosophy .
Goodling testified before a House panel last year that she had told Elston he should identify such candidates .
Goodling directed Elston to lead the selection committee in 2006 .
She and Elston have both left the Justice Department .
She refused to be interviewed for the inspector general 's report .
As a result of the controversy , the hiring process was changed in 2007 to insulate hiring decisions from political considerations .
Both Justice Department policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations .
The report did not find clear evidence that an earlier screening committee took political considerations into account .
It says data from 2002 shows a disparity in the hiring of liberal and conservative candidates , but there were no complaints about the committee 's work from 2003 to 2006 , when Goodling put Elston in charge of the process .
The report Tuesday is the first of perhaps several to be issued as the broad - ranging investigation into the role partisan politics has played in the Justice Department during the Bush administration .
Goodling is expected to be a central figure in later inspector general reports examining efforts to increase the influence of conservatives in the department .
The Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility , a separate watchdog office that monitors prosecutorial conduct , joined in the inspector general 's investigation .
CNN 's Terry Frieden contributed to this report .
All About U.S. Department of Justice • Democratic Party • Alberto Gonzales

BBC 's diplomatic correspondent
President Bush still has some six months in office With US President George W Bush nearing the end of his time in the White House , this is inevitably a period of transition in relations between Europe and America .
Much has changed since the bitter trans -Atlantic divisions prompted by the US invasion of Iraq .
In many ways , these were divisions within Europe as much as between European capitals and Washington .
The governments in France and Germany were especially hostile to the US approach , prompting the then US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to make his famous - though not perhaps entirely accurate - distinction between " old and new Europe " .
This farewell tour by President Bush was very much focussed on " old Europe " .
Though it began in Slovenia which holds the current presidency of the European Union , it then took in Italy , Germany , France and Britain .
Bush saying ' au revoir ' in Paris New , more Atlanticist leaders in both Paris and Berlin have contributed to smoothing over some of the tensions of the past .
Mr Bush , too , has learnt lessons , softening his style , admitting in interviews that some of the rhetoric that appeared to drive America to war in Iraq was ill - judged .
' Softer ' president
In London at the end of his trip , President Bush declared that his legacy would be " a multilateral approach to dealing with tyrants " .
It may not quite be that the Americans are from Mars and the Europeans from Venus .
But in many ways Europe and the US display different mentalities , different ways of looking at the world
But he remained no less committed to the basic propositions that have underpinned his strategy .
Still , there was the profound belief that the free world is engaged in an ideological struggle against the forces of terror and disorder .
His belief that forms of government matter and in the transformative effects of freedom and democracy remains undiminished .
Nonetheless this was , in some ways , a softer president than many Europeans have seen before .
And the growing US emphasis on multilateralism , whether it be in dealing with Iran or North Korea 's nuclear programme , or in tackling the great issues of the day - like global trade and the environment - looks set to pre-figure any change in style by the next administration .
It is easy to write off this trip as a farewell tour by a lame duck president .
But Mr Bush still has some six months in office .
There is still business to be done .
And in the post - 9/11 world it is impossible to ignore the fact that events will shape the closing months of the Bush era just as they shaped its opening .
Events may well also have a profound effect upon the US presidential race itself .
Iran warning President Bush has used this European tour to set the groundwork for the ratcheting up of pressure on Iran .
Iranians must understand , however , that all options are on the table
US President Bush
Bush and Brown 's warning to Iran
The stage is set for possible EU sanctions against Tehran if the Iranians reject the latest offer of civil nuclear co-operation in return for the abandonment of their enrichment programme .
In London , inevitably , there was more practical work to be done - not least because in the part of Britain 's relationship with the US that remains " special " - its military and security ties - there is so much going on .
Britain seems to have backed away from any early troop pull - out from Iraq .
For good measure it has actually agreed to reinforce its presence in Afghanistan .
In the longer term , these two missions are not sustainable given the overstretch afflicting Britain 's relatively small armed forces .
It is in the British national interest to confront the Taleban in Afghanistan or Afghanistan would come to us
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown
UK set to increase Afghan troops
But the view of the government of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown seems to be that both missions can be sustained for just a bit longer .
If a new US president comes in committed to a more ambitious withdrawal plan then Britain , too , can pull out the bulk of its forces from southern Iraq .
Chemistry
Of course , Mr Brown does not share the same empathy with President Bush as his predecessor , Tony Blair , did .
Public opinion in Europe will certainly be glad to see the back of Mr Bush
Personal chemistry between leaders matters .
Indeed , better chemistry between Mr Bush and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy has undoubtedly contributed to a waning of trans -Atlantic tensions .
So what of the future ?
Public opinion in Europe will certainly be glad to see the back of Mr Bush .
Equally , the growing fascination with the drama of the US presidential race may well help to rehabilitate America 's reputation in some quarters .
For many analysts it has become commonplace to assert that all will be different once President Bush leaves office .
Some believe a new era of American multilateralism will dissolve once and for all the tensions of the recent past .
But this is to misjudge far more fundamental forces that are at work that may well increase the distance across the Atlantic whatever the outcome of this November 's presidential election .
' Different mentalities ' Britain 's much - vaunted " special relationship " with Washington provides an interesting perspective on wider US - European ties .
The people 's decision has to be respected and we have to chart a way through
Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin
' No quick fix ' to Irish No vote Indeed , some analysts would argue that Tony Blair 's departure exposed structural changes in Anglo - US ties that have been reinforced in the post - 9/11 world .
For one thing Europe - a region of relative stability - looms less large in US thinking , which is focused more on the Middle East and Asia .
A concern in Washington that the EU might develop into some kind of rival power centre to the US has proved groundless .
As the rejection of the Lisbon reform treaty by Irish voters last week has shown , Europe is obsessed with its own internal issues , and a larger EU is inevitably going to be less coherent abroad .
Ties between London and Washington will remain strong , not least because of the close military and security relationships that Britain will not be eager to relinquish .
But in approaching many of the big issues of the day like terrorism , Middle East peace , or global warming , Britain tends increasingly towards a more European rather than an American outlook .
It may not quite be that the Americans are from Mars and the Europeans from Venus , but in many ways Europe and the US display different mentalities , different ways of looking at the world .
And this trend is likely to continue , whoever takes the helm in the White House next year .

World leaders fight terrorism all the time , with summit meetings and sound bites and security initiatives .
But they have studiously ignored one of the most common and brutal varieties of terrorism in the world today .
This is a kind of terrorism that disproportionately targets children .
It involves not W.M.D. but simply AK - 47s , machetes and pointed sticks .
It is mass rape  and it will be elevated , belatedly , to a spot on the international agenda this week .
The United Nations Security Council will hold a special session on sexual violence this Thursday , with Condoleezza Rice coming to New York to lead the debate .
This session , sponsored by the United States and backed by a Security Council resolution calling for regular follow - up reports , just may help mass rape graduate from an unmentionable to a serious foreign policy issue .
The world woke up to this phenomenon in 1993 , after discovering that Serbian forces had set up a network of “ rape camps ” in which women and girls , some as young as 12 , were enslaved .
Since then , we ’ve seen similar patterns of systematic rape in many countries , and it has become clear that mass rape is not just a byproduct of war but also sometimes a deliberate weapon .
Nintendo released its fiscal 2008 earnings , and the news was all good .
The company reported sales in the 2008 fiscal year of ¥ 1.67 trillion ( about $ 16 billion ) , 73 percent more than last year .
Net income improved 48 percent to 257 billion yen ( $ 2.6 billion ) , and the yearly dividend nearly doubled from ¥690 per share ( $ 0.82 per American Depositary Receipt , which is what a U.S. investor would trade in ) in 2007 to ¥ 1,260 per share ( $ 1.51 per ADR ) this year .
The company now has ¥ 1.1 trillion ( $ 10.5 billion ) in cash and equivalents , up from ¥689 billion ( $ 6.6 billion ) last year .
Nintendo's forecasts for next year are also bullish : the company expects a 26 percent jump in net profit .
These numbers mean that the business is doing very , very well , but they also paint the picture of a gaming juggernaut that is going to be harder to combat than Nintendo 's competitors would have liked ; nearly every criticism leveled against Nintendo has been answered with cold , hard numbers .
Wii owners buying games in droves
One of the ongoing bits of " accepted wisdom " in regards to the Wii is that no one is buying games ; there is the perception that many casual gamers are simply using their system as a Wii Sports box .
The New York Times recently ran a story claiming that Nintendo had low attach rates for the system ; their source for these numbers , VGCharts , has gone on record to disagree with the analysis of its own data .
According to Nintendo's own data , each Wii owner has purchased 6.07 games for their system since launch worldwide , a figure that 's in line with the competition .
The US audience is even hungrier for Wii games , as the attach rates for systems in America is 7.48 games per system .
In the past fiscal year , Nintendo increased its amount of million - sellers on the Wii from five to 26 .
Super Smash Bros .
Brawl has sold 4.85 million units worldwide alone , and that 's before the game even launches in the UK .
This is n't counting the millions of Virtual Console games being sold , which amount to almost pure profit for Nintendo .
Wii hardware sells well internationally .
Data source : Nintendo
There is also the fact that Nintendo is doing well in multiple regions , which is a large advantage against Sony and Microsoft 's weak sales worldwide .
Microsoft may sell well in the US , but it 's death in Japan , and is beaten by Sony in Europe .
Sony has a good hold on Europe and excellent PSP sales in Japan , but the PS3 usually brings up the rear in US sales .
Contrast that with Nintendo's strong sales in Europe , North America , and Japan , and you have a company that does well worldwide .
Nintendo's strength in multiple regions , as well as almost surreal sales of both its portable and console system , make it a very formidable foe in the market .
You can say that the Wii is n't particularly friendly to third - party games , and there might be some truth there ; the majority of runaway successes on the Wii have been published by Nintendo itself .
You can , however , find titles by third parties that have sold over a million units each : titles like Guitar Hero III , Resident Evil 4 : Wii Edition , Carnival Games , Rayman Raving Rabbids , and even Red Steel have all surpassed the million mark .
This is n't including the scores of games such as Lego Star Wars that move huge numbers ; focusing on the NPD 's top - ten list is rather shortsighted when it comes to gauging how games are doing : there is a huge margin between the million sellers on the list and failure .
The arguments against the Wii's apparent success — that players are n't using it after it 's purchased , that game sales are low , and that it 's a fad — are starting to ring hollow , and the latest data from Nintendo should go a long way towards silencing the critics .
While developers are struggling to understand the Wii , trying to figure out how to deal with its prominence in gaming , or simply slamming it to the press , one thing is apparent : gamers know exactly what to do with the console .

Ah Vermont , that lovely New England state known for its maple syrup , Ben & Jerry ’s ice cream …and now , limited liability corporations that only exist online .
[ digg=http://digg.com/business_finance/Vermont_OKs_the_Creation_of_Virtual_Corporations_GigaOM]
On June 6th , Gov. Jim Douglas signed an inauspicious - sounding bill entitled “ H.0888 , Miscellaneous Tax Documents ” that could revolutionize the way startup companies are formed and run .
As New York Law School professor David Johnson explained to me , up until now , U.S. law required LLCs to have physical headquarters , in - person board meetings and other regulations that have little relevance in the digital age .
No longer .
Under the new law , for example , a board meeting may be conducted “ in person or through the use of [ an ] electronic or telecommunications medium . ”
A “ ‘ virtual company ’ will be , as a legal matter , a Vermont limited liability company , ” said Johnson .
And other states are required to recognize the corporation as a legitimate LLC .
So while in the past many companies registered in Delaware to take advantage of that state ’s business - friendly policies , with this law , Internet - driven startups may find Vermont even more ideal .
Johnson was instrumental to crafting the bill ’s language ; he , along with his NYLS students and a couple of professors at Vermont Law School , spent the last two years putting it together .
He foresees virtual companies launched for countless reasons , such as the production of software or publications written by people across the country , even for corporations that exist only in Second Life .
As you may have guessed , this is n’t just an academic exercise for Johnson ; he ’s also developing software to manage virtual corporations through NYLS ’ DoTank project .
Since word of the Vermont bill ’s passing got out , he said , “ I ’ve had two people beg me to be the first to get on the list ” to start filing virtual incorporation papers .
Indeed , it ’s easy to see this becoming standard practice in coming years , with traditional office buildings being abandoned for dynamic companies that exist wherever its employees happen to crack open their computers .

A fascinating survey of music consumption conducted for British Music Rights has good and bad news for the beleaguered music business .
The bad news : online file sharing is more prevalent than other surveys suggest .
The good news : a lot of people are willing to pay for a service that offers legal , licensed P2P file sharing .
Half the people surveyed think distributors such as large telecomms companies should pay creators from the proceeds of such a license .
And a surprisingly large number of people still value physical music goods , with two thirds of potential subscribers to legal P2P saying that they would continue to buy CDs .
Legal P2P services have been waiting in the wings for years , and telcos and ISPs are keen to offer innovative music sharing services that allow them to escape the fate of being in a low - margin commodity business .
However , the biggest labels have feared that a service would cannibalise their physical sales ; and without the ability to offer all music , telcos wo n't bite .
The BMR survey may persuade rights holders to break the impasse .
74 per cent of people surveyed said they wanted a legal P2P service where they could " own " and keep the songs downloaded .
The figure rose to 80 per cent amongst active P2P downloaders .
Enthusiasm was notably cooler when it came to paying for streaming music .
64 per cent were not interested in a file streaming service that did n't allow the punter to keep a permanent copy .
62.9 per cent of potential subscribers to a legal file sharing service still said they 'd continue to buy CDs , compared to 52.3 per cent of potential subscribers to streaming services that do n't let you keep the music .
In the " digital age " , people still love their music collections .
73 per cent value it as their most treasured possession - higher than their mobile phone and higher than any other prompted item , such as clothes , DVDs or books .
So why are CDs , which are filling the charity shops by the lorry load each day , still valued so highly ?
The most cited reason was simply the desire to own a physical hard copy of the music .
Over 40 per cent said they like aspects of the CD packaging .
Less than 10 per cent said it was because the CD had superior sound quality .
Share the music
63 per cent acknowledge they " illegally " download unlicensed music - with the average monthly download being 53 tracks a month .
Altruism plays a large part , the survey discovered .
More than two thirds said they were giving something back to the community .
The reason that most frequently appears on website comments - that music is " too expensive " - was only cited by around 10 per cent of respondents .
" This suggests that respondents recognise the value in the ‘ share - ability ’ of music and are motivated by a sense of fairness and the principle of reciprocity – something for something illegally , " BMR concludes .
Only 10 per cent of the population surveyed has n't shared music one way or another .
BMR discovered that making music available online is far more widespread - " a common activity for many respondents " .
Overall , 62 per cent of respondents have downloaded music using P2P , and 52 per cent have uploaded music .
The average number of CDs copied and passed on to friends 5.05 for the 18 - 24 age group , and 2.30 for 25 +.
Resources .
It ’s a dehumanizing term that is also flat - out wrong for nearly every profession I can think of .
Project planning requires estimates and scheduling .
I ’ve got no problem with that except when it treats people as interchangeable cogs .
In a manufacturing process , skilled workers might be interchangeable .
There are only so many ways to stamp out a piece of machinery or otherwise work the assembly line .
The process can be perfected to the exact number of steps involved in making a thing .
Read The Toyota
Way to get a better feeling for how world class manufacturers achieve this .
THESE AREN’T RESOURCES
But there are many , many professions that do not and can not achieve worker utility , where swapping out one “ resource ” for another is feasible or sensible .
Does George Steinbrenner schedule a “ short stop resource ” or does he get Derek Jeter ?
Do they Yankees want homerun hitting A - Rod or a mere “ 3rd baseman resource ” ?
Did the Chicago Bulls staff a “ shooting guard resource ” or did they need Michael Jordan ?
Did Apple do well when it had a CEO “ resource ” or did they achieve the incredible after Steve Jobs came back to lead the company ?
Do you want a 1st year medical intern ( your “ doctor resource ” ) performing your brain surgery or do you want the foremost expert in the field ?
Do you want an “ acting resource ” or does Brad Pitt have more marquee power ?
When was the last time you looked for a “ contractor resource ” instead of hiring the very best contractor you could find to renovate your home ?
Thoughtworkers and creative types are no different .
Software engineers are simultaneously creative and logical , and there is an order of magnitude difference between the best and worst programmers ( go read Peopleware if you do n’t believe this ) .
Because of this difference , estimates have to change based on the “ resource , ” which means we ’re not interchangeable cogs after all .
IT ’S THE TEAM , STUPID
You can schedule me to be the Yankees 3rd base resource ( thereby saving cost in the Cost - Schedule - Quality tradeoff ) , but I ’m certain the quality of the product would suffer despite the fact that I played little league baseball for years as a kid .
Similarly , you can cast me in your movie , but I ’m not sure I ’d sell any tickets .
I would n’t do any better running Apple than John Sculley , and you definitely do n’t want me performing brain surgery .
Talent matters .
Winning organizations build winning teams , they do n’t schedule resources and they do n’t break up a winning team .

What 's up with the gang after all this time ?
In order to survey the impact of massive solar power plants on the environment and wildlife , the federal government is freezing new solar projects on public land for about two years .
The alternative energy industry is reacting as if the world 's tofu supply has been exhausted , since this effectively nukes new solar power development for the time being ( because buying private land is way more expensive for startups than leasing public land ) .

Caught in the crossroads are environmentalists who both love the desert tortoise and solar power .
The industry says that the government could do impact studies without halting new proposals for solar projects - we think they 're telling the truth , since they 're probably less evil than oil companies and actually do want the Mojave ground squirrel to thrive and live happy furry lives .
And I mean , two years , really ?
[ NYT via Fark ]
The rising global population means not just more mouths to feed , but more sophisticated tastes to satisfy as developing countries grow wealthier .
And as demand for food increases around the world , supply capacity is struggling to keep up with these changing requirements - with potentially dire consequences for every nation .
At the three - day summit hosted by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) in Rome last week , world leaders discussed the rising food prices .
Without direct and effective action , the poor of the world face great suffering .
In the last 12 months alone , according to the FAO , 100 million have joined the world 's hungry , and 22 countries remain particularly vulnerable to chronic hunger .
But in developed countries , too , the availability and cost of food will begin to carry a political , economic and social significance not seen for generations .
To help understand the implications of change for the EU and UK , Chatham House , home of the independent international affairs thinktank the Royal Institute of International Affairs , has developed four scenarios that explain possible future pictures of global food supply .
These have been used to help representatives of the UK's wheat and dairy supply networks to focus on the challenges they face and the choices they may have to make :
1. " Just a blip "
Higher prices trigger a major investment in production capacity .
In broadly the same timescale of two to three years , good weather allows global yields to recover .
Food input costs decline as geopolitical conditions improve and the oil price drops , undercutting biofuel production .
Food prices drop back , though they remain volatile because of continuing speculative investment .
This scenario demonstrates the extent to which all the main price - determining factors would have to play out favourably if food prices are to fall back to more familiar levels .
As a possibility , it is considered by many in the UK food supply industry to be too complacent .
There is a widely - held view that , even if some easing back in commodity prices is seen , something more akin to structural change is occurring in global food production and supply .
2. Food inflation
Global demand for food continues to grow and persistently outpaces production growth , albeit by a narrow margin .
Investments in production technology ensure that global food production capacity is not overwhelmed , but the proportion of personal income spent on food ends its long - run downward trend .
The economic logic of this scenario is currently a topic of debate among investors .
The world economy appears to be heading for a recession , and normally , under these conditions , commodity prices would be falling in expectation of reduced economic activity .
Yet they remain high .
Sustained food inflation will create a number of challenges on the domestic front and all sectors will find it difficult to access the capital investment necessary to meet raised productivity targets .
3 . Into a new era
Climate change worsens and global oil supply contracts , keeping food supply input costs high .
Per capita production falls steadily .
A dramatic shift in food production and manufacturing in general becomes unavoidable ; the new emphasis is on " regenerative " , rather than " extractive " , practices .
This scenario will require the development of new supply concepts , policies and structures , with the drive for technological innovation and the need for significant levels of agricultural investment seen as converging concerns .
Whether sufficiently high yields can be achieved through an alternative production paradigm is certainly controversial , particularly as the whole concept entails change to existing models of food production and delivery .
But many observers maintain that numerous pockets of innovation are already pushing in this direction .
The new , radical circumstances prevailing will require industry to develop different competitive models - ones that derive market edge from their compliance with environmental and ethical standards .
Government will need to decide whether it is to be the driver or facilitator of the new supply system 's development .
Potentially important areas of policy making include waste and the promotion of better resource management , the expansion of agricultural and food system capacity , and investment in science and technology .
4. Food in crisis
Exacerbated by crop and / or animal diseases , serious food shortages develop .
This causes universal public shock and growing political panic .
The struggle , even in the developed world , is to keep people fed .
With prices skyrocketing , the crisis response creates an untested set of supply arrangements .
Issues such as choice and values - based purchasing assume a second order priority .
The success or failure of businesses will depend critically on their ability to secure supplies and the strength of their trading partnerships .
Governments will face a series of difficult decisions on when and how far to intervene .
In more strategic policy terms , there may be implications for the UK 's trade and international relationships .
Conflicts of interest between national and EU priorities may become a particular focus of attention .
These four global scenarios reveal significant points of debate and questions for all stakeholders across the EU / UK food supply system .
The expected impacts of the circumstances presented provide a stark warning that " business as usual " models could fail or , at best , be poor preparation for the coming period .
The ability to secure raw materials and the effective utilisation of resources suggest that consideration may need to be given to the current division of responsibilities between the EU and UK in a number of areas affecting food supply .
At the same time , exciting opportunities could be created for the UK to develop new competitive strengths .
The initiatives that will deliver them are likely to be built around a framework that encourages innovation , waste reduction , partnership - led approaches and the acceptance of possible changes in consumption patterns .
Increased investment in scientific and technological research and development , and the question of how such efforts should be funded and focused , will be critical .
Long - term planning needs to start now .
A first step would be the establishment of a consortium bringing together government , supply network interests , and a range of groups , such as media , NGOs and universities .
The partnership would need to undertake a proactive review of current arrangements , developing and delivering a fresh , concept - based demand and supply strategy for food .
Continuing to focus on the UK's wheat and dairy industries , Chatham House 's food research is now studying in more detail the options available to the EU and the UK government .
By exploring alternative futures , we are looking to encourage the better planning of food systems and to avoid short - term responses that threaten to exacerbate rather than resolve current pressures in the system .

Summit pledges
The biggest UN food summit in the past decade ended in Rome last week with 181 governments pledging to address the causes and effects of soaring global food prices , which have seen the cost of most foods doubling in under three years , riots in many countries , and food export restrictions imposed by some of the biggest producers .
While nearly $ 3bn ( pounds 1.5 bn ) has now been pledged by governments and banks , it is unclear if any of the money is additional to existing aid budgets .
One of the biggest donors to the World Food Programme , the UN body that distributes food aid to more than 80 countries , was Saudi Arabia , which gave $ 500 m .
Writing in the online magazine openDemocracy at the end of the conference , Simon Maxwell , director of the Overseas Development Institute in London , said : " When the price of oil goes up by , say , $ 30 per barrel , Saudi Arabia is gifted nearly $ 300 m a day in extra revenue , so the gift to WFP represents the windfall profit from one weekend . "
The final declaration from the talks also encouraged rich and poor countries to continue efforts to liberalise international trade in agriculture by reducing trade barriers and market distorting policies .
Talks have been stalled for months , with neither Europe nor the US wanting to reduce subsidies .

But of all the messages sent into space , which ones are good ?
Which ones conform to quality standards ?

The Pioneer Plaques
These are identical , gold - plated plaques attached to the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft .
They feature a picture of the solar system , a picture of the probes and a pictorial representation of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen .
Ring any bells ?
No ?
Well , it also has a picture of a naked man and woman on it .
Ah , yes .
Now you remember .
Many people considered this nothing more than interstellar porn .
Others objected to the fact that the man is the one waving his hand , presumably to give the woman time to bake the aliens a nice batch of muffins .
My objection is that the people depicted have no body hair at all .
Aliens are gonna come down and think we 're living in symbiosis with our pubes .
Grade : C
The Voyager Record
I love that we sent an LP .
It 's so delightfully retro !
I expect alien life forms to discover it and say , " Clearly , this is the work of a truly groovy civilization .
We do not know what to expect when we visit their planet , but we should prepare ourselves for an extremely mellow experience . "
In actuality , the funkiest track on the album is " Johnny B. Goode , " which I think is a poor choice .
I mean , I 'm not sure how one carries a guitar in a gunnysack , and I was born on this planet .
Grade : B
The Arecibo Image
This is actually a short binary message beamed into space .
When decoded , it creates an image that looks remarkably similar to an Atari 2600 videogame .
The apparent object of the game is to maneuver your guy through the cavern and up the waterfall , bypass the attacking spacecraft and grab a delicious slice of cake while avoiding the evil letter M. I 'd play that game .
It should be noted that the human depicted here is also naked , but he 's a pixel guy so it 's fine .
We do n't want aliens to know we have genitals , but it 's OK if they mistake us for table lamps .
Grade : A
The Teenage Message
This was beamed into space in 2001 .
It starts with some radio- transmission Doppler - tuning boring - boring - boring thing , segues into theremin music – THEREMIN MUSIC – and finally ends with some more binary images , including the logo of the Teenage Message program itself .
So lame .
It 's called the Teenage Message because it was put together by Russian teenagers .
I think that will be apparent to anyone who receives it .
" Blaxnorvag !
What is this tedious message from another world ? "
" I do n't know , Jerry , but it sounds like something put together by Russian teenagers . "
Grade : D
Television Signals
A common science fiction trope involves aliens intercepting our television shows and being so impressed that they use it as a basis for their entire civilization .
That 's pretty egotistical .
Even human beings do n't base their entire lives on one long - defunct television show .
Well , except for Firefly fans .
Presumably aliens who can detect our faint signals can get any channel on any planet , and I hear Canopus has some pretty compelling public - access shows .
Still , we should use this to our advantage .
We need to immediately produce a television show about benevolent aliens who come to Earth and give human beings candy and hugs and play Super Smash Brothers Brawl with them , but do n't use Pit because he 's cheap .

Fighting the Good Fight : Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe
We 've written a bit about Soul Eater here , both Atsushi Okubo 's long - running manga series and the animated version that 's just started airing in Japan .
What we have n't written , though , is a basic introduction to the series , its world , and its characters , which would help just a little bit to put those earlier reviews in perspective .
Doing everything backwards is still an improvement on not doing anything at all , so for newcomers to the world of Soul Eater , here 's a basic field guide to the armament , equipment , and personnel of Shinigami Weapons Development .
" Shibusen " is one of those Japanese acronyms created by stringing syllables from several bigger words together .
Just as " daikaku Bunkakyukai " ( or " Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture " ) gets wrapped up in a nutshell to become Genshiken , so does " nigamiki Shokuninmongakkou " become " Shibusen " for short .
The long - form version of the name means something like " Death God Weapons Craftsmanship Institute . "
" Senmongakkou " more specifically refers to a vocational school , an institution students attend to learn a practical trade , and that 's what Shibusen is for .
Located in the aptly - named Death City , it 's where apprentice craftsmen learn to make weapons for the God of Death .
Shinigami - sama , to use his proper name , already has a scythe for reaping souls with , but apparently scythes wear out from time to time , so he needs a steady supply of new ones .
Crafting a Death Scythe takes time and effort , though , on the part of both the weapon - smith and the weapon himself ( or herself , as the case may be ) .
Youngsters attending Shibusen have a mix of book - learning and practical duties .
Soul Eater tends to focus on the extra- curricular side of things , since it 's obviously not much fun to watch our heroes snooze through their lecture courses .
Bringing a weapon into being in the laboratory , anyway , is barely half of the job , which is why the kids can't just hang around school all the time .
At any given time , apprentice weapons technicians are usually at work on just one weapon .
( This is n't a hard and fast rule , however , as we 'll see a little bit further down . )
A would - be Death Scythe takes a lot of care to craft , and more to the point , it takes a lot of use .
It has to get used to reaping souls before Shinigami - sama can put it to work .
It has to reap a certain kind of soul , though .
A Death Scythe 's diet primarily consists of " kishin , " which literally means " fierce god . "
In the context of Soul Eater 's fictional world , a kishin is a human soul gone bad , filled with enough hatred and power to evolve into a deadly monstrous form .
Scythe - crafters perform a useful service by catching evil souls before they turn into full - fledged kishin , and by feeding those souls to their scythes , they gradually evolve them towards completion .
The basic math goes like so : 99 kishin souls and one witch 's soul .
Of course , the witch 's soul is the kicker .
Witches are among the major antagonists in Soul Eater -- the most powerful among their number can go toe - to - toe with Shinigami - sama and his deadly chop , or close enough to it in any case .
Once a scythe has eaten its requisite diet of those 100 souls , no more and no less , it 's officially a Death Scythe .
If it looks like a witch and casts spells like a witch , though , it still is n't always a witch , which gets a certain rookie weapon - smith in trouble right away .
Seven African governments and the world 's largest banks and construction firms meet in London today to plan the most powerful dam ever conceived - an $ 80 bn ( £ 40 bn ) hydro power project on the Congo river which , its supporters say , could double the amount of electricity available on the continent .
G8 and some African governments hope that the Grand Inga dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo will generate twice as much electricity as the world 's current largest dam , the Three Gorges in China , and jump start industrial development on the continent , bringing electricity to hundreds of million of people .
But while governments and banks expect the dam to export electricity as far away as South Africa , Nigeria and Egypt , and even Europe and Israel , environment groups and local people warned that it could bypass the most needy and end up as Africa 's most ruinous white elephant , consigning one of the poorest countries to mountainous debts .
The dam is being planned to exploit one of the largest major water falls by volume anywhere in the world - nine miles of rapids which lie 90 miles from the mouth of the Congo where the world 's second largest river drops nearly 100 metres in just eight miles .
Two hydroelectric plants , known as Inga 1 and Inga 2 , were constructed near there in the 1970s and a third is planned , but Grand Inga is intended to dwarf them all .
One feasibility study suggests the 40,000 MW dam will be 150 m high , and will harness 26,000 cubic metres of water a second , with more than 50 turbines each producing nearly as much power as a British nuclear reactor .
Grand Inga was proposed in the 1980s but never got beyond feasibility studies because of political turmoil in central Africa .
But now it stands a chance , according to Gerald Doucet , secretary general of the World Energy Council thinktank , which is convening the London meeting .
" It is the greatest sustainable development project , offering Africa a unique chance for interdependence and prosperity , " said Doucet .
" It 's much more feasible now than ever .
There is a peace settlement in Congo , and economic and technical studies have all shown it is possible . "
Grand Inga 's prospects of being completed by 2022 are said to have risen significantly in the last year as countries , banks and private companies have found they can earn high returns from the emerging global carbon offset market and UN climate change credits .
In return for investments in clean power , rich countries such as Britain hope to be able to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions against the renewable energy that dams such as Grand Inga would produce , and constructors are making windfall profits out of renewable energy projects in developing countries .
" The banks and the City of London see that Grand Inga is serious .
The G8 countries are behind it because they can get UN clean development mechanism [ CDM ] credits to offset their emissions .
Chinese , Brazilian and Canadian dam - building companies , as well as the World Bank , are all interested , " said Doucet .
But advocacy groups said yesterday the plans ignored local people and could leave Congo with massive debts rather than a sustainable industrial base .
" The project would be a magnet for corruption in one of the world 's least stable regions .
Its enormous budget and large contracts could devolve Inga into a corruption - riddled white elephant .
Inga will centralise a vast store of the region 's electric and financial power , a development model that can foster tensions and civil wars , " said Terri Hathaway , Africa campaigner with International Rivers , a watchdog group monitoring the project .
Hathaway said that the 94 % of people in Congo DRC and the two in three Africans who have no electricity now were unlikely to benefit because the dam depends on exporting its electricity to existing centres of industry , especially in South Africa where there have been power shortages .
" As it stands , the project 's electricity wo n't reach even a fraction of the continent 's 500 million people not yet connected to the grid .
Building a distribution network that would actually light up Africa would increase the project 's cost exponentially .
It would be very different if rural energy received the kind of commitment and attention now being lavished on Inga , " she said .
Despite Congo having exported electricity for years from Inga 1 and Inga 2 , access to electricity across the country is less than 6 % , and in rural areas where nearly 70 % of people live , it is only 1 % .
" My village is 3 km from Inga 's power lines .
They built a line almost 2,000 km to the mines [ in Katanga province ] but in all of these years we have been left without electricity , " said Simon Malanda , a community representative .
Doucet acknowledged that " there are huge social issues around Grand Inga that must be dealt with .
Congo must benefit .
If Congo is bypassed then the whole project fails , " he said .
Bee Tamer Covers Himself with 60,000 Bees
People can coexist with animals , even those that are considered dangerous wild animals , without fear of death or injury .
There are two parts to the trick of remaining unscathed while in the presence of animals ; do n’t make the animals nervous and know the animal .
Hou Dongming , 33 , is a local beekeeper in Siping ’s Pingxi County .
His excursion into interaction with animals is the â€œbee - man showsâ€ he puts on .
He learned the practice from his father Hou Wanfu , 60 .
First Dongming puts on a hat , black divers goggles , a pair of tightly sealed trousers , and then puts soft paper in his ears and nostrils .
His upper torso is naked and he wears a small cage tied around his neck in which is a queen bee .
Dongming sits still amid dozens of beehives while his father begins to drive bees to his son .
The queen puts out pheromones that attract the males who swarm over Dongming ’s body .
Within a half hour up to 60,000 bees cover Dongming .
Although he sometimes gets stung , he manages to escape serious injury .
People who are allergic to bee stings can die from just a few and even those that are n’t allergic can die from a few hundred .
Almost anything could startle a swarm of bees into a stinging frenzy .
A twitch or a shiver , a flash of light , or a loud noise might make the males think the queen is in danger and start them stinging .
To me , he ’s the â€œnutâ€ that goes with the honey .

( CNN ) -- Barack Obama touched hearts during an impassioned speech to a 200,000 - strong crowd in Berlin , German newspapers agreed , but suspicions remain about the White House contender 's motives for courting a European audience .
Barack Obama addressed a huge and friendly crowd in Berlin on Thursday .
Berlin's Der Tagesspiegel wondered whether so many young people had ever gathered for a political event in Germany and said that Obama 's address -- which echoed speeches by former U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan when the divided city was in the Cold War frontline -- could only have been made in the German capital .
" Barack Obama 's address might not have been statesmanlike and it definitely was n't worldly - wise .
But with its symbolism and the message of this 46 - year - old , it certainly was the signal of a new era for a new generation on both sides of the Atlantic , " the newspaper said .
" What better thing could have happened to us than the potential next president of the U.S. sending this message to the world from here ? "
Obama moved on from Germany to France on Friday where he was due to hold talks with President Nicolas Sarkozy .
He is also slated to meet British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and opposition leader David Cameron in London later Friday .
German tabloid Bild said Obama had articulated his version of the American dream -- the idea that politics can change the world : " Unlike George W. Bush , he wants to do this in cooperation with others , especially Europe .
That 's his message from Berlin : Let 's try this together ! "
But Bild warned that an Obama presidency would place fresh demands on traditional allies such as Germany , which fell out with Washington over the war in Iraq and has refused to contribute combat troops to NATO operations in Afghanistan .
iReport.com : View photos from the scene
" He did n't say what he expects , but it 's not hard to figure it out .
He 'll call for more German participation during international crises ; he 'll call for more German soldiers , " said Bild .
But it concluded : " No matter how you might feel about this : A President Obama would be Germany 's friend -- and a fan of Berlin ! "
Munich 's Sueddeutsche Zeitung sounded a more cautious note , warning that an Obama presidency would be " expensive for Germany . "
" He explicitly called for German soldiers for Afghanistan -- he did not say ' more soldiers ' but that was what he meant , " said commentator Reymer Kluever .
" And Obama also indicated this : he will want support as president to wind up the Iraq adventure . "
The paper noted too that the speech had been intended less for the crowds gathered in Berlin 's Tiergarten park than for " hesitant white voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania , Colorado and Virginia " and said that Obama had proved himself to be a clever tactician , capable of shifting positions to suit his audience .
" He wants to convince ( voters ) that the world will also listen to a black president ...
And there 's one other thing one should n't forget when talking about Obama :
He easily reworks even positions that have been written in stone and adjusts to new requirements . "
But nobody in the German press appears to have been quite as smitten by their visitor as Bild reporter Judith Bonesky , who had the opportunity to work out with Obama in the gym of the Ritz Carlton Hotel earlier in the day .
" Obama ( with toned arms and a strong back ) puts on his headphones for his iPod to listen to pop music .
He hums quietly .
Then he jumps on a fitness bike .
He pushes three times on the pedals -- but then can't be bothered with it .
" He picks up a pair of 16 kilo weights and starts curling them with his left and right arms , 30 repetitions on each side .
Then , amazingly , he picks up the 32 kilo weights !
Very slowly he lifts them , first 10 curls with his right , then 10 with his left .
Quickly I ask : " Mr. Obama , could I take a photo ? " .
" Of course ! " he answers , before asking my name and coming over to stand next to me .
" My name 's Judith " I reply .
" I'm Barack Obama , nice to meet you ! " he says , and puts his arm across my shoulder .
I put my arm around his hip -- wow , he did n't even sweat !
WHAT A MAN ! "

From a vacuum to the void
Why the Irish voted against the Lisbon treaty is unclear – but it was the lack of establishment opposition that kickstarted the ‘ No ’ campaign .
On 12 June , as we all now know , the Irish people rejected the Treaty of Lisbon .
Never one to miss a political wrestling match on my native soil , I had taken a week 's holiday and headed home to campaign for a ‘ Yes ’ vote .
The mood I found in Ireland was unlike anything I had seen before , a toxic mix of apathy , confusion and fear .
I still believe the Irish are overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the European project , and so I find myself facing the same question as most European politicians :
Where did it all go wrong ?
The treaty had the overwhelming support of mainstream political parties , so much so that 81.7 % of voters in the last election supported a party that was actively campaigning for a ‘ Yes ’ .
Only one party in the Dáil , the Irish parliament , opposed the treaty – the left - wing nationalist Sinn Féin , representing just under 7 % of the electorate .
One party – the Greens – was too divided internally to take an official line , but all six of its deputies , who serve in the governing coalition , actively campaigned in favour of the Treaty .
The treaty also had the support of the business community , the trade unions , and – eventually – the farmers ' associations .
This huge imbalance in favour of the treaty is central to understanding the dynamic that emerged in the referendum campaign .
With all major civil - society actors in favour of the treaty , a huge political vacuum opened up on the ‘ No ’ side .
And rich rewards await those who fill a political vacuum .
Anti-Lisbon campaigners seized the opportunity , securing publicity and recognition – much of it guaranteed , because state broadcasters were obliged by law to give equal airtime to both sides of the referendum divide on all panel discussions , debates and talk shows .
This led to an absurd situation in which media producers had to go searching for speakers who opposed the treaty .
Ministers and senior politicians in favour of the treaty were pitted against unelected community activists and lobbyists fresh out of college , for the simple reason that there were so few notable public figures who opposed the treaty .
The effect on the Irish political landscape has been dramatic .
In the course of the campaign , a number of previously low - key figures from the political extremes have been turned into household names .
A guerrilla war against the political establishment
Even so , the battle remained lopsided , with all the mainstream political parties on one side and , at best , marginal political forces on the other .
But while the ‘ Yes ’ side had plenty of commanding political figures , it discovered it lacked foot soldiers , enthusiastic believers willing to stand on street corners and knock on doors and fight for the treaty .
The ‘ No ’ side , in contrast , had an army of young activists , fired by a sense of mission and purpose that won the hearts of many voters .
I make no apologies for the military analogies : every evening , particularly in the run-up to the vote , I felt like I was coming home from a day of trench warfare .
In many ways , the dynamic of the debate resembled the contest between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the US , a clash between old politics and new politics
Or , perhaps , guerrilla warfare , for the ‘ Yes ’ camp was assaulted from all sides , by four different factions with varying motives and tactics .
Only one , the nationalist faction , included members of the Dáil : four Sinn Féin deputies .
The treaty would result in lost influence , sovereignty and neutrality : these were the claims the nationalists made .
They highlighted the loss of a commissioner and the proposed changes to voting rules in the Council of Ministers as signs that Ireland would lose its voice in Europe .
It was repeatedly claimed that in the Council “ Ireland 's vote is halved and Germany 's vote is doubled ” , a claim that ignores half of the voting procedure .
Its party leader , Gerry Adams , asked the taoiseach ( prime minister ) , Brian Cowen , to return to his EU counterparts and renegotiate the treaty , while Sinn Féin posters promised voters that “ Ireland can get a better deal ” .
The far - left faction was keen to steer the campaign to a debate similar to the one that occurred in France when it was voting on the proposed Constitutional Treaty , the choice between a “ Social Europe ” and a “ Corporate Europe ” .
Its members cast doubt amongst voters on the EU 's commitment to workers and union recognition .
Referring liberally to a number of past rulings by the European Court of Justice , they assured voters that the EU would force Ireland to privatise public services .
The far - left parties – none of which were represented in the Dáil – were also very effective at using anti-war sentiment to raise fears of the implications of the European Security and Defence Policy ( ESDP ) aspects of the treaty .
A third faction consisted of far - right Christian groups , who – to the consternation of Catholic bishops – were arguably the most willing to make spurious claims about the content of the treaty .
A newly founded lobby group , Cóir ( Irish for “ justice ” ) , was particularly active , and although it did not publicly acknowledge any affiliations , the address of its office is the same as that of Youth Defence , a controversial anti-abortion group .
Voters were told that the Charter of Fundamental Rights would force Ireland to legalise abortion , gay marriage , prostitution and euthanasia .
Although these claims were roundly dismissed by campaigners on both sides of the campaign , they still found their way onto unattributed posters across the country .
The fourth faction , Libertas , was the wild card of the campaign .
This previously unheard - of group , which described itself as a ‘ think - tank ’ , launched a surprisingly professional campaign against the unsuspecting establishment .
The group was founded by Declan Ganley , an entrepreneur with no history in Irish politics .
Reputed to have amassed over €300 million in a career that started in commodity dealing in the crumbling Soviet Union , Ganley could be described as something of an Irish oligarch .
However , Libertas insist that all their funding has come from individual donors giving no more than € 6348.69 each .
The Libertas campaign focused on claims that the Lisbon treaty was undemocratic and bad for the Irish economy , pointing in particular to the prospect of future tax harmonisation .
Ireland 's low corporate - tax rates are often celebrated as a key factor in turning Ireland into a “ Celtic tiger ” and in the economic boom that the country enjoyed intermittently from the mid-1990s until 2007 .
While the group enjoyed only minority support in the business community , it communicated its message effectively to voters .
All televised debates and discussions invariably included an articulate and well - informed Libertas speaker , and they offered sceptical voters a seemingly mainstream voice to trust in a field otherwise crowded by the political extremes .
“ At last a ‘ Yes ’ campaigner - where are the rest of you ? ”
In many ways , the dynamic of the debate resembled the contest between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the US , a clash between old politics and new politics .
The political establishment worked on the assumption that it would win , and when unexpectedly faced with a dynamic force in opposition it was unable to react .
The ‘ Yes ’ side focused on the past , reminding voters of the benefits EU membership has already brought , while the ‘ No ’ side set its sights set firmly on what a future EU might look like .
While the four anti-Lisbon factions filled the streets of Dublin with young eager activists , the pro-Lisbon political parties found many of their members less informed and perhaps less motivated .
While handing out fliers on Dublin 's main shopping street several people remarked to me that they had yet to be approached by pro-treaty campaigners .
As the vote neared and the main political parties panicked at the prospect of losing , they did manage to mobilise their grassroots members – but at that stage most voters had already made up their minds or lost interest .
The war on the web was even more imbalanced .
A number of slick anti-treaty websites emerged , and their snappy slogans and flash graphics left the factual pro-treaty websites looking dull .
The anti-treaty websites were very effective in using Google 's advertising service to bring in voters doing their research online .
As for finance , Libertas was the only group to properly tap the fundraising potential of the internet , a strategy that provided it with a campaign budget unmatched by any political party .
When asked how much the group was planning to spend on the campaign , Ganley famously replied “ as much as we need to spend ” .
Most estimates suggest the think tank 's total expenditure was over € 1.3 million , while Fianna Fáil , the largest pro-treaty party , spent an estimated € 700,000 on its campaign .
“ I do n't understand it , so I 'm voting No ”
The result was a remarkable turnaround .
Six months ago , polls showed that a strong majority favoured the treaty , but by the eve of the vote , the pro-treaty side was spending so much energy refuting the reasons to vote ‘ No ’ that it was unable to communicate the reasons to vote ‘ Yes ’ .
Beaten on the ground by the ‘ No ’ campaigners , the ‘ Yes ’ camp also failed in the information war .
The taoiseach who negotiated the text , Bertie Ahern , refused to publish the most basic information – the referendum date – until the last minute , a move which left voters feeling they were being taken for granted .
His resignation , because of a financial scandal , then hogged the headlines for a further three weeks .
And so by the time the mainstream political parties started to focus on the treaty the ‘ No ’ side had already gained momentum .
And while opponents of Lisbon set the agenda for discussion with short , simple slogans , the ‘ Yes ’ camp was hampered its efforts to distil the treaty into compelling slogans by the treaty itself .
By the time the referendum arrived , every home in the country knew it was an unwieldy document , because each home had received an independent guide to the treaty from the Referendum Commission .
The result could be seen in surveys that suggest the Lisbon treaty was ultimately rejected because many Irish voters did not understand what they were voting on or why they were voting on it .
So , even if the ‘ Yes ’ camp had fought a better ground war , it would have been vulnerable to a structural weakness – it had a complicated treaty to sell and it was faced with an opposition all too willing to oversimplify it .
In the aftermath , for those who watched events unfold on the ground , one thing seemed clear : Nobody was to blame and everybody was to blame .
Perhaps , as the political editor of the Irish Times , Stephen Collins , argued , the result was “ not so much a protest vote against the Irish government and not so much a vote against the treaty ” as a “ a vote against almost everything ... a vote against politics . ”

NEW YORK  Rush will be appearing on " The Colbert Report , " and it 's not Limbaugh .
The Canadian band Rush , which has n't performed on U.S. television in more than three decades , will play their classic " Tom Sawyer " on the Comedy Central show Wednesday ( 11:30 p.m. EST ) .
The Geddy Lee-led trio , which is currently on tour , has n't played on U.S. television since 1975 .
Rush is only the latest act to perform on " The Report , " which has steadily edged closer to " Ed Sullivan Show " territory .
With increasingly frequent musical performances , " The Report " has grown a variety - show impulse , evident in other upcoming bookings .
The rapper Nas will perform on July 23 , Toby Keith will return for a second performance on July 28 and Crosby , Stills and Nash will play on July 30 .
The Stephen Colbert - hosted comedy show was originally launched as a parody of conservative political punditry  and shows like " The O'Reilly Factor " do not make a habit of hosting music performances .
But " The Report " circus has expanded into musical realms , often with its sonorous host joining in .
John Legend , Neil Young , R.E.M. , Tony Bennett , Peter Frampton , Willie Nelson , Barry Manilow , John Mellencamp , the Roots and Carole King have all performed on the show .
Colbert 's enthusiasm for the music has been easily apparent .
He 's sung the Star Spangled Banner ( in two - part harmony ) with Legend , and mocked the MTV - style band interview by questioning R.E.M. from a stool twice the size of those the band sat on .

So What Is Erlang and OTP ?
Origins of Erlang
1987 The first experiments began with this nascent language which became Erlang .
1988 The ACS / Dunder project was started at Ericsson .
This was a prototype implementation of PABX by developers external to the core Erlang developers .
1989 The ACS / Dunder project became a full fledged project with the reconstruction of about a tenth of the complete , production PABX called the MD - 110 system .
The preliminary results where very promising .
In this early phase developer productivity was already ten times greater then during the development of the original system in the PLEX language .
This reimplementation also pushed forward experiments directed at increasing the speed of Erlang .
1991
At this point the experiments directed at speeding up Erlang bore fruit .
A fast implementation of Erlang was released to growing user community .
Erlang was also presented at an international telecom conference that year .
1992 During this year the user base started growing significantly .
Erlang was ported to VxWorks , PC , Macintosh and other platforms .
Three new , complete applications were written in Erlang where presented at another conference .
The first two production projects using Erlang are started .
1993 Distribution primitives where added to the language , which made it possible to run a homogeneous Erlang system on heterogeneous hardware .
A corporate decision was made within Ericsson to begin selling and supporting Erlang externally .
A new organizational structure was built up to maintain and support Erlang implementations and Erlang Tools .
This resulted in the creation of Erlang Systems AB .
1996 OTP was formed into a separate product group within Erlang Systems AB .
This represented the maturing of the OTP platform within Erlang .
After nearly ten years of development the ( non- Erlang ) AXE / N project was closed down and pronounced a failure .
This left a large whole in Eriksson 's product line and development of a new replacement product was started to fill it , it was decided that this replacement product would be written in Erlang .
1998 After two years the AXE /N replacement project , now called the AXD301 was delivered .
Around this same time the CEO of Ericsson Radio became the CEO of Ericsson as a whole .
This person had banned Erlang at Ericsson Radio and though he never banned Erlang at Ericsson proper it became career suicide to propose Erlang new Erlang projects .
This problem effectively killed opportunities for Erlang Systems AB to sell the language and support .
The primary question potential customers asked was ' Who wants to use a language developed by Ericsson when Ericsson wo n't use the language itself ? '.
This just goes to show that corporate bureaucracy will be corporate bureaucracy autocracy no matter where you are .
In any case , this turned into a bit of a blessing in disguise for the rest of us .
1998 -99
In order to drive further development a decision was made within Erlang Systems AB to release Erlang as an Open Source project .
This did n't imply an abandonment of Erlang by Ericsson or Erlang Systems AB .
Erlang continued and continues to be supported by these two organizations .
This decision was made wholly with the idea of spreading Erlang and removing the , somewhat negative , idea that it was a proprietary language .
It has remained open source and supported to this day .
So How Do I Get Started ?
As some of you may have guessed , I am a fan of Erlang .
I think that it 's a very interesting language with a tremendous amount of promise for the type of server side applications that I usually end up working on .
I have talked a lot about various things here on Erlangish , so I thought it would finally be appropriate to spend a bit of time talking about the topic of the blog .
For the most part I will be delving into the , somewhat obscure , history of Erlang .
I will also spend a bit of time providing some instructions on how to get started with the language .
Erlang is a distributed , concurrent , soft real time functional programming language and runtime environment developed by Ericsson , the Telecoms Infrastructure supplier .
It has built - in support for concurrency , distribution and fault tolerance .
Since its open source release in 1999 , Erlang has been adopted by many leading telecom and IT related companies .
It is now successfully being used in other sectors including banking , finance , ecommerce and computer telephony .
OTP is a large collection of libraries for Erlang to do everything from compiling ASN.1 to providing an application embeddable http server .
It also consists of implementations of several patterns that have proven useful in massively concurrent development over the years .
Most production Erlang applications are actually Erlang / OTP applications .
OTP is also open source and distributed with Erlang .
Although Erlang is a general purpose language , it has tried to fill a certain niche .
This niche mostly consists of distributed , reliable , soft real - time concurrent systems .
These types of applications are telecommunication systems , Servers and Database applications which require soft real - time behavior .
Erlang excels at these types of systems because these are the types of systems that it was originally designed around .
It contains a number of features that make it particularly useful in this arena .
For example ; it provides a simple and powerful model for error containment and fault tolerance ; concurrency and message passing are a fundamental to the language , applications written in Erlang are often composed of hundreds or thousands of lightweight processes ; Context switching between Erlang processes is typically several orders of magnitude cheaper than switching between threads in other languages ; it 's distribution mechanisms are transparent , programs need not be aware that they are distributed and The runtime system allows code in a running system to be updated without interrupting the program .
Given that there are things that Erlang is good at there are bound to be a few things that it 's not so good at .
The most common class of ' less suitable ' problems is characterized by iterative performance being a prime requirement with constant - factors having a large effect on performance .
Typical examples are image processing , signal processing and sorting large volumes of data .
I am firmly convinced that Erlang 's history is a key ingredient to its success .
I am not aware of any other language whose early development was so straightforward and pragmatic .
For most of its life Erlang was developed inside Ericsson , originally for internal use only .
Later on it was made available to the external world and eventually open sourced .
The timeline of its development goes something like this .
1982 –1985
Ericsson identified some issues that existed with telecom languages at the time .
To address these difficulties they started experiments with the programming of telecom applications using more then twenty different languages .
These early experimenters came up with a few features that a useful system needed to supply .
They realized that the target language must be a very high level symbolic language in order to achieve productivity gains .
This new requirement vastly subseted the language space and resulted in a very short list of languages .
The languages included Lisp , Prolog , Parlog , etc.1985 –1986
Further experiments within this subseted list where performed .
New results were generated from this round of experiments as well .
They found that the theoretically ideal language also needed to contain primitives for concurrency and error recovery , and the execution model needed to exclude back - tracking .
This ruled out two more of the contending languages , Lisp and Prolog .
This ideal language also needed to have a granularity of concurrency such that there would be a one to one relationship between one asynchronous telephony process and one process in the language .
This ruled out Parlog .
At the end of this round of experiments they where left with out any languages in the list they had started with .
Being the pragmatic folks that they were , they decided to develop their own language with the desirable features of Lisp , Prolog and Parlog , but with superior concurrency and error recovery built into the language .
As you can see the Erlang did n't start out as Erlang at all .
It started out as just a series of requirements backed up by experiments .
A large number of experiments where done to find the language that matched those requirements .
When no existing language was found Ericsson decided to create their own .
Considering Ericsson 's resources and the costs associated with development of their products I think this was a very pragmatic decision .
However , that conclusion is open to interpretation .
In any case , after the initial development there was a constant back and forth dialog between the users and developers of the language as the language moved through its formative process .
I think this fact alone is one of the reasons that Erlang is as good as it is today .
Later on in its development as Ericsson grew less resourceful Erlang started to have political problems within the company .
Even though Ericsson had several successful and profitable products in Erlang and other languages the de-facto ban occurred .
Fortunately by this time Erlang could and did stand on its own .
The ban actually turned out to be fortunate for the rest of us because it led , pretty directly , to Erlang 's eventual Open Sourcing .
Joe Armstrong , one of the original Erlang Developers and a productive member of the community put together a number of tutorials that are very useful .
Its worth going through these and playing with the code .
There are a couple of good editors to use with Erlang .
The gold standard is the Erlang Emacs mode distributed as part of the Erlang distro .
A very updated version is now available from the Erlware folks .
You can get it here
If you go this route I suggest you also get Distel , an add - on written by Luke Gorrie .
It 's available from the the good folks at google code .
There are instructions included with both of these to get you up and going .
For those of you more inclined to the IDE world you may want to take a look at Erlide .
This is a set of Eclipse plugins that add support for Erlang to Eclipse .
Its still pretty beta , but it 's very usable .
Learning Erlang is a fairly quick process .
For an experienced developer it should n't take more then a few days before they can write nontrivial programs , about a week or two to feel really comfortable and a month or so before feeling ready to take on something big by themselves .
It helps a lot to have someone who knows how to use Erlang around for some hand - holding .
Start off by going through the quick start part of the FAQ .
Then go through the Erlang Course .
You can skip the history part if you would like .
I have gone over it in more detail here .
Once you have done the course play around with some of the examples .
Then go read the long version of the getting started docs .
This should put you on the road to being able to write some Erlang code .
If you are one to worry about coding conventions then you may want to take a look at http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml .
This has quite a number of useful and well thought out programming rules .
One of the things that makes Erlang really interesting is the OTP System .
If you really want to get to know something about Erlang then it make sense to spend a bit of time learning OTP and http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/part_frame.html is a very good place to start .

Scientists around the world are excited about all the things that the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope , or GLAST , is going to uncover after it launches on June 5 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Fla .
There are many reasons for worldwide excitement about GLAST .
Not only is the equipment state - of - the - art , but it will allow us to see objects in space differently .
" The Universe looks remarkably different outside the narrow range of colors in the spectrum that we can see with our eyes , " said David Thompson , GLAST Deputy Project Scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. " GLAST will give us a spectacular high - energy ' gamma-ray vision , ' " said Thompson .
Gamma rays are the highest - energy form of light in the electromagnetic spectrum and cannot be seen by the naked eye .
Thompson noted " If you 're in space with gamma - ray vision , there are gamma - rays coming from all directions .
The Milky Way would be a brilliant swath of light , and you 'd see a sky constantly changing with objects dimming and brightening on different time scales .
If you see a blinding flash , that would be a gamma-ray burst ! "
GLAST's " Gamma - ray vision " will help scientists answer a lot of questions like :
How do black holes accelerate jets of material to nearly light speed ?
What is the mysterious dark matter ?
What mechanism produces the stupendously powerful explosions known as gamma-ray bursts ?
How do solar flares generate high - energy particles ?
How do pulsars work ?
What is the origin of cosmic rays ?
and What else out there is shining gamma rays ?
" One thing that 's exciting is the cutting - edge instrumentation of the Large Area Space Telescope or LAT , ” said Peter Michelson , LAT Principal Investigator , Stanford University , Calif .
" That 's where gamma - rays convert to matter and anti-matter within the telescope designed to detect them .
By the direction of the particles , we can detect which direction the gamma - ray came from and find its origin in space .
The LAT makes breakthrough improvements in all the key capabilities . ”
" Another exciting thing is that the GLAST LAT is the first imaging gamma-ray observatory to survey the entire sky every three hours over a huge energy range , " said Steve Ritz , GLAST Project Scientist at Goddard .
This is important because the gamma - ray sky is constantly changing in stunning ways .
The GLAST observatory , which also includes the GLAST Burst Monitor , spans a factor of 10 million in energy from the highest to the lowest energy gamma rays it will detect . ”
Anticipation and excitement are near peak for the GLAST launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station CCAFS , Fla .
Liftoff is set for June 5 during a window that runs from 11:45 a.m. to 1:40 p.m. EDT .
The preparations leading up to the launch are almost complete .
During the weekend of May 17 , GLAST was rolled out to CCAFS ' Launch Pad 17 - B and hoisted atop the Delta II rocket .
After the spacecraft was placed in the Delta II rocket , technicians then successfully completed the state - of - health checks for the spacecraft .
The GLAST spacecraft is 9.2 feet high by 8.2 feet in diameter when stowed , where it is just under the 9 - foot diameter allowed in the fairing .
The fairing is basically just the outside shells of the rocket .
Once GLAST is launched into space , it becomes a little bit taller and much wider when the Ku- band antenna deploys and the solar arrays are extended .
Five days later , on May 22 , the Flight Program Verification was conducted .
This is an electrical and mechanical test of the rocket and spacecraft working together as a single , integrated system during countdown and launch milestones .
With this test completed , spacecraft closeouts began .
On May 27 , the Delta II Rocket fairings were closed around the GLAST satellite .
Because there were 18 institutions in six countries involved in the creation of GLAST , everyone is now eagerly awaiting the launch .
NASA 's GLAST mission is an astrophysics and particle physics partnership , developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy , along with important contributions from academic institutions and partners in France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Sweden , and the U.S .

People in most countries around the world are happier these days , according to newly released data from the World Values Survey based at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research .
Data from representative national surveys conducted from 1981 to 2007 show the happiness index rose in an overwhelming majority of nations studied .
“ It ’s a surprising finding , ” said U - M political scientist Ronald Inglehart , who directs the World Values Surveys and is the lead author of an article on the topic to be published in the July 2008 issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science .
“ It ’s widely believed that it ’s almost impossible to raise an entire country ’s happiness level . ”
The 2007 wave of the surveys also provides a ranking of 97 nations containing 90 percent of the world ’s population .
The results indicate that Denmark is the happiest nation in the world and Zimbabwe the unhappiest .
The United States ranks 16th on the list , immediately after New Zealand .
During the past 26 years , the World Values Surveys have asked more than 350,000 people how happy they are , using the same two questions .
“ Taking all things together , would you say you are very happy , rather happy , not very happy , not at all happy ? ”
And , “ All things considered , how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days ? ”
Combining responses to these two questions , Inglehart and colleagues constructed an index of subjective well - being that reflects both happiness and general life satisfaction .
In the 52 countries for which a substantial time series is available ( covering 17 years on average ) , this index rose in 40 countries and fell in only 12 .
The average percentage of people who said they were “ very happy ” increased by almost seven points .
“ Most earlier research has suggested that happiness levels are stable , ” Inglehart said .
“ Important events like winning the lottery or learning you have cancer can lead to short - term changes , but in the long run most previous research suggests that people and nations are stuck on a ‘ hedonic treadmill . ’
The belief has been that no matter what happens or what we do , basic happiness levels are stable and do n’t really change . ”
The new findings from the World Values Surveys not only show that during the past 25 years , happiness has in fact risen substantially in most countries .
Fully as important as the fact that happiness rose is the reason why .
In recent decades , low - income countries such as India and China have experienced unprecedented rates of economic growth , dozens of medium - income countries have democratized and there has been a sharp rise of gender equality and tolerance of ethnic minorities and gays and lesbians in developed societies .
Economic growth , democratization and rising social tolerance have all contributed to rising happiness , with democratization and rising tolerance having even more impact than economic growth .
All of these changes have contributed to providing people with a wider range of choice in how to live their lives — which is a key factor in happiness .
The people of rich countries tend to be happier than those of poor countries , but even controlling for economic factors , certain types of societies are much happier than others .
“ The results clearly show that the happiest societies are those that allow people the freedom to choose how to live their lives , ” Inglehart said .
As an example , Inglehart points to the tolerant social norms and democratic political systems in Denmark , Iceland , Switzerland , the Netherlands and Canada all of which rank among the 10 happiest countries in the world .
“ The events of the past 25 years have brought a growing sense of freedom that seems to be even more important than economic development in contributing to rising happiness , ” Inglehart said .
“ Moreover , the most effective way to maximize happiness seems to change with rising levels of economic development .
In subsistence - level societies , happiness is closely linked with in - group solidarity , religiosity and national pride .
At higher levels of economic security , free choice has the largest impact on happiness . ”
He also notes that the largest recent increases on the subjective well - being index , measuring both happiness and life - satisfaction , occurred in the Ukraine , followed by Moldova , Slovenia , Nigeria , Turkey and Russia .
“ While most ex-communist countries show low levels of happiness , many of them show large recent increases in subjective well - being , ” Inglehart said .
“ The collapse of communism was generally followed by a sharp decline in well - being , which tended to rise again with economic recovery . ”

Officials in Antigua are now trying to draw a line in the sand , claiming that if the US does n't finally agree to allow some forms of online gambling by the end of this month , it will go ahead with its threats to ignore US copyrights with the approval of the WTO .
As you may recall , back in December , the WTO granted Antigua that right , after a loooooooong series of battles with the US over whether or not the US was violating free trade agreements by banning online gambling .
Of course , every time the WTO sided with Antigua , the US would stall claim the WTO sided with the US ( when it clearly did not ) and ( my personal favorite ) claim that even if it had broken trade agreements , it did n't matter any more because the US was unilaterally changing its trade agreements so that it was no longer violating them .
Of course , when Antigua won the final decision in December , allowing the country to ignore US intellectual property rights , the US government and the entertainment industry quickly warned Antigua not to follow through on those plans -- but the US government still wo n't shift in its position on the matter .
Thus , Antigua is agitating to get this show on the road .
While it first needs to get one last permission slip from the WTO , once that 's in place , it can start ignoring the copyright on American movies and music .
Of course , while some are suggesting that it may make sense for The Pirate Bay to move to Antigua , that 's not accurate .
After all , the WTO has said that Antigua can only violate $ 21 million worth of intellectual property , and with the way the entertainment industry counts damages , that 's like half an album or so .
In fact , that seems to be exactly the angle that the entertainment industry is taking in this fight .
An MPAA letter warning : " The proposed retaliation would be impossible to manage .
The real and resulting economic harm would vastly exceed any amount the ( WTO ) might approve , even the grossly exaggerated amount ( $ 3.4 billion ) for which Antigua seeks approval , plus the economic harm would extend to other WTO members . "

America 's silent killers are deadly , and do not discriminate .
They target babies , the elderly , teenagers , young adults , middle - age housewives , and businessmen alike .
They poison livestock , pets , and wildlife , and the people behind them deny complicity in the carnage .
Who or what are these silent , deadly killers ?
They are the beautiful , green , uniform , and seemingly beneficial , killing fields of genetically modified ( GMO ) crops .
The people behind them are the U.S. government , the Rockefellers , Monsanto , Dow , DuPont , and Syngenta .
How it Began
Eugenics is a dirty word , yet particularly applicable to America 's killing fields and their inception :
Henry Kissinger drafted the controversial NSSM - 200 in 1974 , called “ the foundational document on population control issued by the United States government . ”
According to NSSM - 200 , elements of the implementation of population control programs could include : the legalization of abortion ; financial incentives for countries to increase their abortion , sterilization and contraception - use rates ; indoctrination of children ; mandatory population control , and coercion of other forms , such as withholding disaster and food aid unless an LDC implements population control programs .
NSSM -200 also specifically declared that the United States was to cover up its population control activities and avoid charges of imperialism by inducing the United Nations and various non-governmental organizations to do its dirty work .
( Human Life International , 2008 )
In 1970 , Henry Kissinger said , " Control oil and you control nations ; control food and you control the people . "
How do you control food ?
By consolidating agricultural interests into what was to be termed agribusiness , creating genetically modified organisms out of heritage seeds with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation , patenting the new seeds , and making sure that these new seeds are force - fed to U.S. farmers as well as the rest of the world .
By holding the patents on these seeds and requiring farmers to purchase new seeds every year , the control is complete .
Also , by controlling how these GMO seeds are created , other more sinister uses come to mind .
But first , you must convince the world of your good intentions .
This is accomplished through lies , deception , and a bit of media manipulation .
By promising farmers that this technology was safe , and would result in increased yields at less cost , they were more than happy to give it a try .
The fact that in most cases this claim was false had yet to be proven by the innocent farmers that believed the lie .
By the time independent studies started revealing that GMO is harmful , it was too late , and the freight train called agri-business was on its way to fulfilling its purpose - to make as much money as possible by spreading GMO seeds as far as possible , and thus gaining control of the population via food .

In the wake of the Father Michael Pfleger controversial sermon last Sunday at Trinity United Church of Christ , Barack Obama sent a letter yesterday resigning from his place of worship for the past 20 years .
I sort of , kind of , understand why he did it .
But I ’m also sort of , kind of , concerned about what this might portend for an Obama presidency .
Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Trinity are community building blocks that the right wing has turned into bricks to be thrown at presidential candidate Obama from now until the general election ends in November — and perhaps beyond .
So in an attempt to turn manufactured right - wing ammo into blanks , Obama has completely separated himself from his minister and his church .
What worries me is this :
Can we expect a President Obama to cave in to the whims and will of the right on policies and issues he knows are important , if this nation is to move forward in a progressive and compassionate manner ?
Can we expect him to genuflect to negative reports by an uninformed , misinformed or ill - willed media ?
Is the candidate of change willing to go - along in a willy - nilly get - along fashion ?
I hope not , but I ’m not sure .
Obama knows what Trinity is about .
I ’ve only set foot in the church twice in my life and I know what it ’s about .
It ’s nothing like it ’s being portrayed in the national media .
Nor is Rev. Wright .
Obama knows that Rev. Wright and his church and Father Pfleger have been forces for good on Chicago ’s South Side for three decades .
Both Trinity and Father Pfleger should have known the Catholic priest ’s racially - tinged mocking Hillary Clinton performance would only be perceived as another weapon to use against Obama .
They should know , as I know , that they ultimately left the Illinois senator with little political choice .
I also know that perception can become reality in our media - defined world .
But reality is not always perception .
And , the reality is that Obama cannot let the right - wing dictate his principles .
Should this become his practice as president , then for those who have invested so much hope in him , his victory will only be a pyrrhic one .
Germany Creates Boom in Geothermal Electricity
June 4th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
New legislation in Germany is making geothermal electricity a viable option for the first time .
Germany ’s support of solar energy , mostly in the form of incentives and high return for consumers who sell excess solar power back to the grid , has made it a world powerhouse in solar energy generation and solar panel manufacturing .
Now it promises to surge ahead in geothermal electricity generation , according to a story in Renewable Energy World .
A new tariff structure has made deep drilling for higher temperature steam financially feasible , causing a boom in plant construction and a shortage of drilling equipment .
“… Germany could be generating several thousands of megawatts ( MW ) of electricity from geothermal sources in a couple of decades .
More plants — some as big as 8 - 10 MW — are due to go into operation in 2009 - 2010 ….
And looking 3 to 5 years ahead , there could be more than a hundred plants .
About 150 geothermal power plant projects are in the pipeline representing an investment of 4 billion euros , according to the German government . ” — Jane Burgermeister , Renewable Energy World
1,300 households get heat , and 500 households get their electricity from a geothermal plant in Neustadt - Glewe , which gets 97 - degree centigrade water from a well dug 2250 meters deep .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In what he called a " defining moment for our nation , " Sen .
Barack Obama on Tuesday became the first African - American to head the ticket of a major political party .
Obama 's steady stream of superdelegate endorsements , combined with the delegates he received from Tuesday 's primaries , put him past the 2,118 threshold , CNN projects .
" Tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another -- a journey that will bring a new and better day to America , " he said .
" Tonight , I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States . "
Watch Obama say he 'll be the nominee »
Obama 's rally was at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul , Minnesota -- the same arena which will house the 2008 Republican National Convention in September .
Speaking in New York , Sen. Hillary Clinton , congratulated Obama for his campaign , but she did not concede the race nor discuss the possibility of running as vice president .
" This has been a long campaign , and I will be making no decisions tonight , " she said .
Watch Clinton congratulate Obama »
There were reports earlier in the day that she would concede , but her campaign said she was " absolutely not " prepared to do so .
Two New York lawmakers also told CNN on Tuesday that during a conference call Clinton expressed willingness to serve as Obama 's running mate in November .
Watch the latest on a possible joint ticket »'
One source told CNN that Clinton told those on the call that if asked by Obama , she would be interested in serving as his running mate .
One of the lawmakers said Clinton 's husband , former President Bill Clinton , has been pushing the idea privately for several weeks .
The Clinton campaign maintains the New York senator merely said she would do whatever is in the party 's best interest , and that her comments Tuesday are no different than what she has been saying for weeks .
Clinton said she would meet with supporters and party leaders in the coming days to determine her next steps .
She also asked people to go to her Web site to " share your thoughts with me and help in any way that you can . "
Watch what could be in store in Clinton 's future »
CNN has projected that Clinton will win the primary in South Dakota and Obama will take Montana .
Those states marked the final contests in the primary season .
Obama praised Clinton 's campaign .
He has been speaking favorably of the New York senator as his focus has turned toward the general election and his battle against John McCain , the presumptive GOP presidential nominee .
" Sen . Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign not just because she 's a woman who has done what no woman has done before , but because she 's a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength , her courage , and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight , " he said .
Diving into general election mode , Obama turned his attacks to McCain , saying it 's " time to turn the page on the policies of the past . "
" While John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past , such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign , " he said .
" It 's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time , as he did in the Senate last year . "
Earlier Tuesday night , McCain portrayed himself as the candidate of " right change . "
" No matter who wins this election , the direction of this country is going to change dramatically .
But the choice is between the right change and the wrong change , between going forward and going backward , " he said in Kenner , Louisiana .
CNN 's Candy Crowley , Jim Acosta , Suzanne Malveaux , Paul Steinhauser and Robert Yoon contributed to this report .

Are n't fax signatures the weirdest thing ?
It 's trivial to cut and paste – with real scissors and glue – anyone 's signature onto a document so that it 'll look real when faxed .
There is so little security in fax signatures that it 's mind - boggling that anyone accepts them .
Yet people do , all the time .
I 've signed book contracts , credit card authorizations , nondisclosure agreements and all sorts of financial documents – all by fax .
I even have a scanned file of my signature on my computer , so I can virtually cut and paste it into documents and fax them directly from my computer without ever having to print them out .
What in the world is going on here ?
And , more importantly , why are fax signatures still being used after years of experience ?
Why are n't there many stories of signatures forged through the use of fax machines ?
The answer comes from looking at fax signatures not as an isolated security measure , but in the context of the larger system .
Fax signatures work because signed faxes exist within a broader communications context .
In a 2003 paper , Economics , Psychology , and Sociology of Security , professor Andrew Odlyzko looks at fax signatures and concludes :
Although fax signatures have become widespread , their usage is restricted .
They are not used for final contracts of substantial value , such as home purchases .
That means that the insecurity of fax communications is not easy to exploit for large gain .
Additional protection against abuse of fax insecurity is provided by the context in which faxes are used .
There are records of phone calls that carry the faxes , paper trails inside enterprises and so on .
Furthermore , unexpected large financial transfers trigger scrutiny .
As a result , successful frauds are not easy to carry out by purely technical means .
He 's right .
Thinking back , there really are n't ways in which a criminal could use a forged document sent by fax to defraud me .
I suppose an unscrupulous consulting client could forge my signature on an non-disclosure agreement and then sue me , but that hardly seems worth the effort .
And if my broker received a fax document from me authorizing a money transfer to a Nigerian bank account , he would certainly call me before completing it .
Credit card signatures are n't verified in person , either – and I can already buy things over the phone with a credit card – so there are no new risks there , and Visa knows how to monitor transactions for fraud .
Lots of companies accept purchase orders via fax , even for large amounts of stuff , but there 's a physical audit trail , and the goods are shipped to a physical address – probably one the seller has shipped to before .
Signatures are kind of a business lubricant : mostly , they help move things along smoothly .
Except when they do n't .
On October 30 , 2004 , Tristian Wilson was released from a Memphis jail on the authority of a forged fax message .
It was n't even a particularly good forgery .
It was n't on the standard letterhead of the West Memphis Police Department .
The name of the policeman who signed the fax was misspelled .
And the time stamp on the top of the fax clearly showed that it was sent from a local McDonald's .
The success of this hack has nothing to do with the fact that it was sent over by fax .
It worked because the jail had lousy verification procedures .
They did n't notice any discrepancies in the fax .
They did n't notice the phone number from which the fax was sent .
They did n't call and verify that it was official .
The jail was accustomed to getting release orders via fax , and just acted on this one without thinking .
Would it have been any different had the forged release form been sent by mail or courier ?
Yes , fax signatures always exist in context , but sometimes they are the linchpin within that context .
If you can mimic enough of the context , or if those on the receiving end become complacent , you can get away with mischief .
Arguably , this is part of the security process .
Signatures themselves are poorly defined .
Sometimes a document is valid even if not signed : A person with both hands in a cast can still buy a house .
Sometimes a document is invalid even if signed :
The signer might be drunk , or have a gun pointed at his head .
Or he might be a minor .
Sometimes a valid signature is n't enough ; in the United States there is an entire infrastructure of " notary publics " who officially witness signed documents .
When I started filing my tax returns electronically , I had to sign a document stating that I would n't be signing my income tax documents .
And banks do n't even bother verifying signatures on checks less than $ 30,000 ; it 's cheaper to deal with fraud after the fact than prevent it .
Over the course of centuries , business and legal systems have slowly sorted out what types of additional controls are required around signatures , and in which circumstances .
Those same systems will be able to sort out fax signatures , too , but it 'll be slow .
And that 's where there will be potential problems .
Already fax is a declining technology .
In a few years it 'll be largely obsolete , replaced by PDFs sent over e-mail and other forms of electronic documentation .
In the past , we 've had time to figure out how to deal with new technologies .
Now , by the time we institutionalize these measures , the technologies are likely to be obsolete .
What that means is people are likely to treat fax signatures – or whatever replaces them – exactly the same way as paper signatures .
And sometimes that assumption will get them into trouble .
But it wo n't cause social havoc .
Wilson 's story is remarkable mostly because it 's so exceptional .
And even he was rearrested at his home less than a week later .
Fax signatures may be new , but fake signatures have always been a possibility .
Our legal and business systems need to deal with the underlying problem – false authentication – rather than focus on the technology of the moment .
Systems need to defend themselves against the possibility of fake signatures , regardless of how they arrive .

Is it fair to accuse the US of destroying our national sovereignty ?
The issue is so little discussed that even to make the claim has parallels with the ravings of the europhobes that Brussels plans to make Britons eat square sausages .
Yet consider the following seven facts , none of which depends directly on the way the US dragged Britain into Iraq , nor on the current MI6 - CIA intelligence blame game about the war .
Firstly , we cannot fire cruise missiles without US permission .
The British nuclear - powered submarine fleet is being converted wholesale so that it is dependent on Tomahawks , the stubby - winged wonder - weapons of the 21st century .
They transform warfare because of their awesome video - guided precision .
But Britain can't make , maintain or target Tomahawks .
The US agreed to sell us 95 cruise missiles before the Iraq war , the first " ally " to be thus favoured .
They are kept in working order by Raytheon , the US manufacturer in Arizona .
Tomahawks find targets via Tercom , the American terrain - mapping radar , and GPS , its ever - more sophisticated satellite positioning system .
The Pentagon , meanwhile , is trying to block Galileo , a European rival to GPS , which the French think will rescue their country from becoming a " vassal state " .
Sir Rodric Braithwaite , former head of the joint intelligence committee and former ambassador to Moscow , published earlier this year a little - noticed but devastating analysis in a small highbrow magazine , Prospect , of the price we are now paying to the US in loss of sovereignty .
Of the Tomahawks purchase , he wrote : " The systems which guide them and the intelligence on which their targeting depends are all American .
We could sink the Belgrano on our own .
But we cannot fire a cruise missile except as part of an American operation . "
The second in this list of sad facts is better known .
Britain cannot use its nuclear weapons without US permission .
The 58 Trident submarine missiles on which it depends were also sold us by the US .
Just as Raytheon technicians control the Tomahawk , so Lockheed engineers control Trident from inside a Scottish mountain at Coulport , and from the US navy 's Kings Bay servicing depot in Georgia , where the missiles must return periodically .
" Cooperation with the Americans has robbed the British of much of their independence , " Braithwaite observed .
" Our ballistic missile submarines operate by kind permission of the Americans , and would rapidly become useless if we fell out with them .
Since it is no longer clear why we need a nuclear deterrent , that probably does not matter .
But it makes our admirals very nervous about irritating their US counterparts . "
The third awkward fact is that Britain cannot expel the US from its bases on British territory , or control what it does there .
Some , such as RAF Fairford , are well known - surrounded by armed guards as the huge B52s roared off nightly to bomb Baghdad .
Others are remote , particularly Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , where any British citizen who attempts a landing will rapidly find himself arrested .
The bases are given bogus British names - such as RAF Fairford or RAF Croughton - because Britain is ashamed of all this .
" The British have never questioned the purposes for which the Americans use these bases , " Braithwaite wrote .
" The agreements which govern them leave us little scope to do so .
It is yet another derogation from British sovereignty . "
The fourth fact is about intelligence .
The row over scraps of British material used for public propaganda purposes - alleged uranium from Niger , alleged 45 - minute Iraqi missile firing times - shows , if nothing else , that MI6 does still run independent spying operations .
But it obscures the big truth : the policy - determining , war - fighting intelligence on which Britain depends is all American .
The US has the spy satellites and the gigantic computers at Fort Meade in Maryland which eavesdrop on the world 's communications .
Britain gets access to some of these because GCHQ in Cheltenham contributes to the pool and collects intercepts which the US wants for its own purposes .
This is cripplingly expensive : Britain has just invested a wildly over - budget £ 1.25 bn in rebuilding Cheltenham .
Yet it brings us no independence .
Braithwaite again : " The US could get on perfectly well without GCHQ 's input .
GCHQ , on the other hand , is heavily reliant on US input and would be of little value without it . "
Robin Cook , the former foreign secretary , recently - and somewhat drily - let it slip to the foreign affairs committee how the US wears the trousers in the intelligence marriage .
America receives all the intelligence that Britain gathers , he said .
" On our side , we have full transparency . "
Britain , on the other hand , merely " strives to secure " transparency from its supposed partners .
These points lead inexorably to the fifth fact about our loss of sovereignty .
Britain can no longer fight a war without US permission .
Geoff Hoon , Britain 's defence secretary , said humbly last month that " the US is likely to remain the pre-eminent political , economic and military power " .
Britain would concentrate , therefore , on being able to cooperate with it .
" It is highly unlikely that the UK would be engaged in large - scale combat operations without the US , " he said .
As Rumsfeld brutally pointed out , however , the US could easily have fought the Iraq war without Britain .
The sixth fact is that Britain cannot protect its citizens from US power .
Blair faces an outcry as he flies into America because the US refuses to return two British prisoners for a fair trial ; rather , they have to face a Kafkaesque court martial at Guantanamo Bay .
And the seventh and final fact is that Britain is reduced to signing what the resentful Chinese used , in colonialist days , to call " unequal treaties " .
At the height of the Iraq fighting , David Blunkett went to Washington to be praised by John Ashcroft , the US attorney general , for what he termed Blunkett 's " superb cooperation " .
Blunkett agreed that the UK would extradite Britons to the US in future , without any need to produce prima facie evidence that they are guilty of anything .
But the US refused to do the same with their own citizens .
The Home Office press release concealed this fact - out of shame , presumably .
Why did the US refuse ?
According to the Home Office , the fourth amendment of the US constitution says citizens of US states cannot be arrested without " probable cause " .
The irony appears to have been lost on David Blunkett , as he gave away yet more of Britain 's sovereignty .
If we really were the 51st state , as anti-Americans imply , we would probably have more protection against Washington than we do today .

Well , I guess this really should n’t shock me , but the International Herald Tribune reports that , as if the wave of pink slips hitting America ’s daily papers and wire services were n’t bad enough , there ’s a new trend that goes hand in hand : outsourcing ( or offshoring , if you prefer ) journalism jobs to India and elsewhere :
The rush of job recruiting ads on MonsterIndia.com tells the story of the latest class of workers to watch their trade start migrating to another continent .
“ Urgent requirement for business writers , ” reads one ad looking for journalists to locate in Mumbai .
“ Should be willing to work in night shifts ( UK shift ) . ”
Another casts for English - speaking journalists in Bangalore with “ experience in editing and writing for US / International Media . ”
Remote - control journalism is the scornful term that unions use for the shift of newspaper jobs to low - cost countries like India or Singapore with fiber - optic connections transmitting information all around the world .
But the momentum for “ offshoring ” to other countries or outsourcing locally is accelerating as newspapers small and large seek ways to reduce costs in the face of severe stresses , from sagging circulation and advertising revenue to shareholder pressure .
“ Outsourcing plays a major part in the newspaper industry of today , ” the World Association of Newspapers concluded in a study released in July .
This trend has been around for a while :
More than two years ago , Reuters , the financial news service , opened a new center in Bangalore .
The 340 employees , including an editorial team of 13 local journalists , was deployed to write about corporate earnings and broker research on U.S. companies .
Since then , the Reuters staff at the Bangalore center has grown to about 1,600 , with 100 journalists working on U.S. stories .
But not to worry :
The World Association of Newspapers , a Paris - based organization representing 72 national newspaper associations , conducted a global survey of about 350 newspapers in Europe , Asia and the United States , and company executives reported that they expected the outsourcing to increase , although few were willing to farm out all of their editorial functions .
Yeah , I ’m sure those corporate VPs at WAN ’s member papers are safe .
Study uncovers how Ritalin works in brain to boost cognition , focus attention
Stimulant medications such as Ritalin have been prescribed for decades to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , and their popularity as " cognition enhancers " has recently surged among the healthy , as well .
What 's now starting to catch up is knowledge of what these drugs actually do in the brain .
In a paper publishing online this week in Biological Psychiatry , University of Wisconsin - Madison psychology researchers David Devilbiss and Craig Berridge report that Ritalin fine - tunes the functioning of neurons in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) - a brain region involved in attention , decision - making and impulse control - while having few effects outside it .
Because of the potential for addiction and abuse , controversy has swirled for years around the use of stimulants to treat ADHD , especially in children .
By helping pinpoint Ritalin 's action in the brain , the study should give drug developers a better road map to follow as they search for safer alternatives .
At the same time , the results support the idea that today 's ADHD drugs may be safer than people think , says Berridge .
Mounting behavioral and neurochemical evidence suggests that clinically relevant doses of Ritalin primarily target the PFC , without affecting brain centers linked to over - arousal and addiction .
In other words , Ritalin at low doses does n't appear to act like a stimulant at all .
" It 's the higher doses of these drugs that are normally associated with their effects as stimulants , those that increase locomotor activity , impair cognition and target neurotransmitters all over the brain , " says Berridge .
" These lower doses are diametrically opposed to that .
Instead , they help the PFC better do what it 's supposed to do . "
A behavioral disorder marked by hyperactivity , impulsivity and the inability to concentrate , ADHD has been treated for more than a half - century with Ritalin , Adderall and other stimulant drugs .
New reports also indicate these meds have lately been embraced by healthy Americans of all ages as a means to boost mental performance .
Yet , despite their prevalence , we know remarkably little about how these drugs work , especially at lower doses that have been proven clinically to calm behavior and focus attention in ADHD patients , says Berridge .
In 2006 , his team reported that therapeutic doses of Ritalin boosted neurotransmitter levels primarily in the PFC , suggesting a selective targeting of this region of the brain .
Since then , he and Devilbiss have focused on how Ritalin acts on PFC neurons to enhance cognition .
To answer this , the pair studied PFC neurons in rats under a variety of Ritalin doses , including one that improved the animals ' performance in a working memory task of the type that ADHD patients have trouble completing .
Using a sophisticated new system for monitoring many neurons at once through a set of microelectrodes , the scientists observed both the random , spontaneous firings of PFC neurons and their response to stimulation of an important pathway into the PFC , the hippocampus .
Much like tiny microphones , the electrodes record a pop every time a neuron fires , Devilbiss explains .
Analyzing the complex patterns of " voices " that emerge is challenging but also powerful , because it allows study of neurons on many levels .
" Similar to listening to a choir , you can understand the music by listening to individual voices , " says Devilbiss , " or you can listen to the interplay between the voices of the ensemble and how the different voices combine . "
When they listened to individual PFC neurons , the scientists found that while cognition - enhancing doses of Ritalin had little effect on spontaneous activity , the neurons ' sensitivity to signals coming from the hippocampus increased dramatically .
Under higher , stimulatory doses , on the other hand , PFC neurons stopped responding to incoming information .
" This suggests that the therapeutic effects of Ritalin likely stem from this fine - tuning of PFC sensitivity , " says Berridge .
" You 're improving the ability of these neurons to respond to behaviorally relevant signals , and that translates into better cognition , attention and working memory . "
Higher doses associated with drug abuse and cognitive impairment , in contrast , impair functioning of the PFC .
More intriguing still were the results that came from tuning into the entire chorus of neurons at once .
When groups of neurons were already " singing " together strongly , Ritalin reinforced this coordinated activity .
At the same time , the drug weakened activity that was n't well coordinated to begin with .
All of this suggests that Ritalin strengthens dominant and important signals within the PFC , while lessening weaker signals that may act as distractors , says Berridge .
" These results show a new level of action for cognition - enhancing doses of Ritalin that could n't have been predicted from single neuron analyses , " he says .
" So , if you 're searching for drugs that might replace Ritalin , this is one effect you could potentially look for . "
He and Devilbiss also hope the research will help unravel an even deeper mystery : exactly how neurons encode complex behavior and cognition .
" Most studies look at how something that impairs cognition affects PFC neurons .
But to really understand how neurons encode cognitive function , you want to see what neurons do when cognition is improved , " says Berridge .
" So this work sets the stage for examining the interplay among PFC neurons , higher cognition , and the action of therapeutic drugs . "

Why not just have a link toBecause of all the URL mucking I can't really use the URL on the Google results page .
I can't simply copy the link destination or bookmark it ; I have to click and go to the page itself .
And whatever they 're doing means I do n't even go to the site when I click the link ; I have to make an extra HTTP connection to google to get a redirect ( 250 ms in the test I just ran ) .
The destination URLs only get rewritten in this way if I 'm logged into my Google Account ; with no google .com cookies you get clean URLs .
I imagine there 's some sort of clickthrough tracking or web search history maintenance or some other vaguely privacy - invading feature I 've long since forgotten about .
There 's ways to do clickthrough tracking without redirecting URLs ; why mess with links ?
I realize writing this I 'm dangerously close to self - parody by dissecting URL structures .
Very few people will care , stuff still works when you click on it .
But Google set a real standard for parsimony and speed in its web applications .
It also has a unique understanding of the value of a simple HTML link .
So it bugs me when they break stuff like that .
PS : to my friends at Google , no need to send me mail explaining why all this stuff is necessary .
I still vaguely remember the explanations for most of it .
My point is that from the outside , as a user who cares about simple HTML , all this extra stuff looks like harmful overhead .
“ Exxon Mobil needs to reconnect with the forward - looking and entrepreneurial vision of my great - grandfather , ” Neva Rockefeller Goodwin , a Tufts University economist , said in a statement to reporters .
Image Neva Rockefeller Goodwin and Peter ONeill , descendants of John D. Rockefeller , are among those who want Exxon to shift priorities .
Shareholders will vote Wednesday on four resolutions .

“ The truth is that Exxon Mobil is profiting in the short term from investments and decisions made many years ago , and by focusing on a narrow path that ignores the rapidly shifting energy landscape around the world , ” she added .
The resolution on Exxon ’s chairmanship was offered for several years before the Rockefellers became publicly involved and last year was supported by 40 percent of shareholders who voted .
Royal Dutch Shell and BP already separate the positions of chairman and chief executive , as do many other companies .
“ You need a board asking the tough questions , ” Peter O’Neill , a private equity investor and great - great - grandson of John D. Rockefeller , said in an interview .
“ We expect the company to figure out how in this changing world to adjust . ”
Kenneth P. Cohen , vice president for public affairs at Exxon , said the shareholders pushing the resolutions were “ starting from a false premise . ”
He added that the company was already concerned about “ how to provide the world the energy it needs while at the same time reducing fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions . ”
Fifteen members of the family are sponsoring or co-sponsoring the four resolutions , but it appears that some have much more solid support in the sprawling family than others .
Mr. O’Neill said that 73 out of 78 adult descendants of John D. Rockefeller were supporting the family effort to divide the chief executive and chairman positions .
The goal of that resolution is to improve the management of the company , which could strengthen its environmental policies and improve more traditional pursuits like exploring more aggressively for new oil reserves .
It 's a cold wet night in the countryside outside Philadelphia , rolling hills dotted with pleasant suburbs and occasional blasted small towns , boarded - up buildings and liquor stores where the proprietor stays safe behind bullet - proof glass .
Hillary Clinton is in a vast building big enough to assemble 747s .
It 's been built on a site long abandoned by US Steel and the growth of a new industrial centre here , it 's meant to symbolise regeneration even after the big corporations have abandoned their workers .
The audience is mostly blue - collar - working class in coats and jackets turned up against the cold .
By contrast she is in a powder - blue trouser suit , the subject of much mirth to the late - night comics .
It 's the kind of garment that makes horrified children say : " Mom , you 're not going to the school play dressed like that ? "
But she 's always attracted that kind of bad - mouthing .
" Why does Hillary always look as if she 's telling you off for not cleaning round the bath ? "
But this audience loves her - or at least the claque who are there to wave banners and cheer , love her very much .
I noticed a steady dribble of people leaving in mid-speech , but in a hall that 's almost too vast to see across , it 's not easy to see who 's leaving and who 's heading for the toilets .
The cheers seem to give her a jolt of life - the audacity of hope , as her main opponent puts it - and even across the concrete acres you can see the eyes and teeth gleam with enthusiasm .
She is ahead in Pennsylvania , a state she absolutely must win handsomely if she is to stay in the contest .
Plenty of Democrats think she is behaving selfishly by staying in at all .
Obama is now the likely winner and John McCain , the Republican , is happily watching the two Democrats kick lumps out of each other .
As one New York Times commentator put it , some Democrats would love to slip a burlap sack over Hillary 's head , and bundle her out of sight before anyone notices .
But even if she is tired , tearful and depressed she can't admit it , even to herself , not for one moment .
She walks into the thump of Eye of the Tiger , the Rocky theme , a film about a white boxer who defeats among others a big tough black guy .
Was it subliminal ?
I doubt it .
In modern politics , glaringly obvious is the new subliminal , and today she made the point directly comparing herself improbably to the Sylvester Stallone character .
She said that ending her campaign now would be as if , " Rocky Balboa had gotten halfway up those art museum steps and said ' Well , I guess that 's about far enough . " '
" Let me tell you something , when it comes to finishing a fight , Rocky and I have a lot in common .
I never quit .
I never give up .
And neither do the American people . "
The claque cheers maniacally , and since then I 've seen the clip a dozen times on TV .
Watching television during an American election is like being trapped on a train by a bore , who insists on making the same point , in your face , over and over again .
The election has turned mean .
Hillary 's husband , who has spent the last seven or so years as a wise , far - sighted elder statesman , seems determined to re-invent himself on his wife 's behalf as a bad - tempered dog .
" I think it would be great if we had two candidates who love this country , " a reference to Obama 's former pastor , who famously led his flock in a rousing chorus of God Damn America .
Saying too Obama does n't love his country is the equivalent of saying : " It would be great if we had two candidates who are n't paedophiles ? "
It 's way below the belt , as are some of Hillary 's lines in the aircraft hanger - for example she implies that Obama would bring in universal healthcare except for people who need it , the old , the poor and sick .
She voted for the Iraq War and Obama did n't , so she now has to re-appear as a peacenik but a militant peacenik - " I think we need a commander in chief who not only respects our armed forces but provides them with the body armour and equipment they need . "
The implication that Obama would leave them to face the warlords dressed in pyjamas and driving golf buggies is left hanging in the air .
Hillary 's biggest problem lately has been the time last week that she " mis- spoke " , describing how , as first lady , she landed in Bosnia under heavy sniper fire when TV footage shows her strolling across the tarmac and being serenaded by a little girl .
Cartoonists have had a wonderful time .
" Then I gnawed through the ropes , knocked a couple of alligators out cold and pulled myself to safety ... "
" The new Indiana Jones movie ? "
" No , just Hillary 's stump speech , " is typical .
( In fact other people on the trip have said there were real fears of sniper fire , and the party wore flak jackets .
In which case , why did she take her daughter Chelsea along ? )
Was the tale another Clinton lie ?
Can either of them ever present a fact without embroidering it , or making it up out of nothing ?
Or was it the notorious sleep deprivation , either in the plane in 1996 or on the campaign trail ?
Either way , it makes nonsense of her campaign ad , the one that has the phone ringing at 3 am and voters are asked who they would rather answer it - the implication being , not that inexperienced whipper - snapper .
Either way the mistake seems to have done great harm and has helped wipe out the memory of Obama 's ferocious preacher .
Some polls have him 14 points ahead among Democratic voters nationally .
But here in Pennsylvania she is playing the union card and playing it well .
The language is all tied to them .
" Who would you hire to do this job ? " she asks .
She keeps repeating the word hire as if the president was just another working guy with a lunch pail worried about his healthcare .
This morning speaking to a hugely sympathetic crowd she said : " I 'll fight for you and I will fight for you as president . "
The militant peacenik even spoke lovingly of target - guided missiles because they are made in America .
She came close to tears when she talked about a pregnant woman in Ohio who lost her baby and then died because she could n't afford a hospital 's $ 100 fees .
" A Clinton had to clean up after the last George Bush , and a Clinton 's gonna have to do it again , " she said .
Which is , after all the whole point of her campaign .
With his tongue firmly in his cheek , Kid Rock has been commenting on file - sharing again but says he does n't need to steal himself , because he 's rich - but not rich enough , as it turns out .
Kid Rock announced that he 's boycotting iTunes because he says between Apple and the labels , they 're keeping all the money .
In recent comments , Kid Rock – real name Robert Ritchie – has said that his record company had previously asked him to stand against “ illegal downloading ” because he was told that people were stealing from him .
According to a BBC report , his response to the label was : “ Wait a second , you ’ve been stealing from the artists for years .
Now you want me to stand up for you ? ’
In true rock and roll style , this performer was n’t going to do as he was told .
“ I was telling kids – download it illegally , I do n’t care , ” he said .
“ I want you to hear my music so I can play live . ”
Now , in 2008 , Kid Rock is boycotting iTunes because he says that artists are not getting their fair share of the revenue generated by the Apple store .
He is annoyed at this ‘ old system ’ “ where iTunes takes the money , the record company takes the money , and they do n’t give it to the artists ” .
Kid Rock crucially talks about how the Internet should ’ve been a “ great opportunity for everyone to be treated fairly , for the consumer to get a fair price , for the artist to be paid fairly , for the record companies to make some money . ”
Of course , as the singer notes , it has n’t turned out that way but concedes that he ’ll probably have to put his music on iTunes at some point but notes that he ’s doing ok overall without it : “ I ’ve just sold a million records , I ’m not really feeling that blow ” he said .
With his tongue firmly in his cheek , Kid Rock also says he does n’t agree with the one - sided argument against file - sharing : “ I think we should level the playing field .
I do n’t mind people stealing my music , that ’s fine .
But I think they should steal everything .
You know how much money the oil companies have ?
If you need some gas , just go fill your tank off and drive off , they ’re not going to miss it . ”
Will this rocker be taking his own advice ?
Probably not .
“ No , I do n’t steal things .
I ’m rich ” he said .

Concerned about the long - term impact of soaring prices , Saudi Arabia is limited in its ability to do much about it .

Olympic torch taken through North Korea
PYONGYANG , North Korea ( AP ) 
The Olympic torch launched its first - ever run Monday in authoritarian North Korea , where the flame was assured of a trouble - free trip unlike other stops worldwide .
An attentive and peaceful crowd of thousands watched the start of the relay in Pyongyang , some waving Chinese flags , in live footage from broadcaster APTN .
The event was presided over by the head of the country 's rubber - stamp parliament who often acts as a ceremonial state leader , Kim Yong Nam .
The North , an ally of communist neighbor China , has been critical of disruptions to the torch relay elsewhere and has supported Beijing in its crackdown against violent protests in Tibet .
North Korea is one of the world 's most tightly controlled countries , where citizens are not allowed to travel freely and civil rights are restricted by the iron - fisted regime .
Kim passed the torch to the first runner Pak Du Ik , who played on North Korea 's 1966 World Cup soccer team that made a historic run to the quarterfinals .
As he began the 12 - mile route through Pyongyang , thousands more cheering people lined city streets waving pink paper flowers and small flags with the Beijing Olympics logo .
The relay began from beneath the large sculpted flame that tops the obelisk of the Juche Tower , which commemorates the national ideology of " self - reliance " created by the country 's late founding President Kim Il Sung , father of current leader Kim Jong Il .
The younger Kim was not seen at the event .
The U.N. children 's agency UNICEF had been asked to participate in the North Korean leg of the relay but withdrew in March , saying that it was n't sure the event would help its mission of raising awareness of conditions for children .
The North 's children are often the most at - risk for starvation in the regular food shortages that plague the country .
The problem is expected to be more severe this year due to poor harvests caused by massive floods last summer that wiped out large swaths of the country 's most productive farmland .
The torch arrived earlier Monday in North Korea by plane from rival South Korea , where China 's treatment of North Korean refugees sparked protests against the relay .
On Sunday , clashes broke out in Seoul near the relay start between a group of 500 Chinese supporters and about 50 demonstrators criticizing Beijing 's policies , carrying a banner reading , " Free North Korean refugees in China . "
The students threw stones and water bottles as some 2,500 police tried to keep the two sides apart .
One Chinese student swatted at the demonstrators with a flagpole .
Another student was arrested for allegedly throwing rocks , police said .
Police said four other people were arrested for trying to disrupt the relay
Authorities deployed some 8,000 police — some riding horses and bicycles — to protect the torch .
One North Korean defector poured gasoline on himself in the middle of a street along the route and tried to set himself on fire , but police quickly surrounded him and carried him away .
The man , 45 - year - old Son Jong Hoon , had led an unsuccessful public campaign to save his brother from execution in the North , where he was accused of spying after the two met secretly in China .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
Over two - thirds of the detainees in the Guantanamo Bay prison are suffering from or at risk of mental problems because they are kept isolated in small cells with little light or fresh air , according to Human Rights Watch .

In a report entitled “ Locked Up Alone : Detention Conditions and Mental Health at Guantanamo ” , the group says 185 of the 270 detainees at the U.S. military prison for terrorism suspects are housed in facilities similar to “ supermax ” prisons .
They spend 22 hours alone in cramped cells , have very limited contact with other human beings and are given little more than the Koran to occupy themselves , said the report , which is based interviews with government officials and attorneys .
Detainees held in this manner include many that have not been charged with crimes and have already been cleared for release or transfer , according to the report .
“ Guantanamo detainees who have not even been charged with a crime are being warehoused in conditions that are in many ways harsher than those reserved for the most dangerous , convicted criminals in the United States , ” said Jennifer Daskal , senior counterterrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch .
More than six years after the United States began sending terrorism suspects to the naval base in Cuba , not a single case has gone to trial .
Nineteen cases are now pending , including some that have been delayed repeatedly amid challenges to the legality of Guantanamo war crimes court set up by the administration of President George W. Bush .
Both U.S. presidential candidates , Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain , have pledged to close the prison , which has been denounced by human rights groups and foreign governments for years .
The Bush administration denies that Guantanamo prisoners are treated inhumanely and the president has said he would like to close the detention centre .
The Human Rights Watch report says that even the two hours of recreation time afforded the prisoners in Guantanamo generally takes place in single - cell cages so that detainees cannot physically interact with one another .
Unlike prisoners in most high security prisons in the United States , none of the Guantanamo detainees have been allowed visits by family members and very few have been able to make phone calls home , the report says .
Several are reportedly suffering depression and anxiety disorder , and some have reported having visions and hearing voices , Human Rights Watch said .
Glenda and I just ran into Dave Chapelle in the new mall on Market Street in San Francisco .
That ’s pretty neat in and of itself , as he ’s a funny dude , but what struck me more was how darn polite he was .
We got to the escalator at the same time and we stopped to let him on but he insisted we go first even though his friend was already ahead of us .
Once we were on the escalator we realized who he was , confirmed by someone on the opposite escalator saying his name in surprise .
I dorked out and snapped a quick photo with my Blackberry .
As we started to walk away he called out and I turned around and tried to figure out why in the world Chappelle would be calling us , it turns out Glenda had dropped her parking ticket and he picked it up and gave it to her .
So not only was he polite and unassumming , he saved us $ 30 .
Someone ’s mother raised him right .
I do n’t know what he was doing hanging out in a mall in San Francisco with a skateboard , but I sure hope he had a nice night too .
AMITYVILLE , N.Y. , June 26 ( UPI ) --
A second - grader 's T - shirt bearing criticism of the " N - word " has itself become the subject of criticism by suburban New York school officials .
Jaiden Haber , 8 , was asked by the principal at Amityville 's Northwest Elementary to change her shirt , which carried the slogan " N the ' N ' Word " and " It 's time ! "
Now the issue has become a source of contention with the girl 's mother and the New York Civil Liberties Union , Newsday reported Thursday .

Jaiden 's mother , Karen Haber , 45 , said teachers should have " seized the moment " to discuss the shirt because it was intended to encourage tolerance at the racially diverse school .
But district superintendent John Williams said the T - shirt was overly inflammatory and a " lightning rod " that outweighed any educational value .
" To send a little white girl wearing this shirt into a very diverse district that is almost 90 percent non-white was not the way to address this word , " he said .
But civil liberties union spokesperson Tara Keenan - Thomson said the school violated Jaiden 's First Amendment rights .
" All students have the right to wear what they want , and this does not stop at the school gates , regardless of content or how old she is , " she said .
So much talk of waterboarding , so much controversy .
But what is it really ?
How bad ?
I wanted to write the definitive thread on waterboarding , settle the issue .
Torture , or not ?
To determine the answer , I knew I had to try it .
I looked at my two small children .
Surely , in the interests of science ?..
But alas , my wife had objections .
Perhaps her ?
Sadly , she is proficient in Ju Jitsu , and I am unlikely to waterboard her .
That leaves me .
Seriously , I determined to give this a try , see how bad it was : Settle the debate authoritatively .
Torture , or not ?
I figure I would be a good test subject .
I am incredibly fit and training for a 100 mile endurance run .
The main thing about such an event is ability to tolerate pain .
I am good at this .
I am trained .
I also have experience with free - diving from my college days .
I once held my breath for 4 minutes and two seconds .
Once , while training as a lifeguard I swam laps without breathing until I passed out , so that I could know my limits .
To determine whether waterboarding is an acceptable interrogation technique or torture I must research it an then undergo it myself .
Once I have done this , Elucidator Diogenes Tomndeb and all the rest of those liberal scum ( no offense intended ) must accept my now accept my now expert opinion .
So , here ’s what I would do .
First I would google waterboarding to understand the basic concepts than I would try it on myself .
First , self inflicted and then , if necessary , inflicted by my wife .
( she has no problem torturing me .
We ’ve been married almost 15 years . )
These are the results of my research and experience :
The goal of waterboarding is to simulate drowning without the actual drowning or inhalation into the lungs .
In order to accomplish this the subject is forced to lie on an inclined plane with his head lower than his lungs and then water is dumped onto his / her face ( always keeping the lungs above the “ Water line . ” )
This simulates drowning and causes a panic .
There are some advanced techniques that make this more extreme , but that ’s the basic concept .
Easy enough to duplicate .
I have an inclined weight bench and a watering can .
No problem .
I lie on this and tilt the watercan to pour water on my mouth and nose .
Water goes up my nose causing me to gag and choke and splutter , but after a try or two I ’m able to suppress my reflex , relax breathe in shallowly and then expel rapidly ( shooting out the water ) and maintain my composure .
This is not too bad .
with my diving experience , you would never break me this way .
I ca n’t beleive those AL Zarqawi guys were such pussies .
Back to researching the advanced techniques :
The first of these is wet rag in mouth .
I try it .
Ok , I can handle this too .
It makes it a little bit more difficult to maintain control .
I did n’t realize it , but the first time around I was selectively breathing through either mouth or nose , to help maintain control .
The wet rag eliminates the mouth as an option .
You have to really concentrate to maintain control , breathing very shallowly on the inhale and not allowing yourself to exhale until you have a good lungfull with which to expel the water in you nose throat and sinuses .
Then , you have to inhale slowly but fast enough to pull in a lungful of air before your nose throat and sinuses fill up .
Difficult , but doable with some self - control .
I can see where this would get very unpleasant if you lost control , but still , not terrible , not torture , per se in my book .
It was n’t as bad as my vasectomy or last root canal , and not nearly so bad as the last OP I read by Liberal .
Next up is saran wrap .
The idea is that you wrap saran wrap around the mouth in several layers , and poke a hole in the mouth area , and then waterboard away .
I did n’t reall see how this was an improvement on the rag technique , and so far I would categorize waterboarding as simply unpleasant rather than torture , but I ’ve come this far so I might as well go on .
Now , those of you who know me will know that I am both enamored of my own toughness and prone to hyperbole .
The former , I feel that I am justifiably proud of .
The latter may be a truth in many cases , but this is the simple fact :
It took me ten minutes to recover my senses once I tried this .
I was shuddering in a corner , convinced I narrowly escaped killing myself .
Here ’s what happened :
The water fills the hole in the saran wrap so that there is either water or vaccum in your mouth .
The water pours into your sinuses and throat .
You struggle to expel water periodically by building enough pressure in your lungs .
With the saran wrap though each time I expelled water , I was able to draw in less air .
Finally the lungs can no longer expel water and you begin to draw it up into your respiratory tract .
It seems that there is a point that is hardwired in us .
When we draw water into our respiratory tract to this point we are no longer in control .
All hell breaks loose .
Instinct tells us we are dying .
I have never been more panicked in my whole life .
Once your lungs are empty and collapsed and they start to draw fluid it is simply all over .
You know you are dead and it ’s too late .
Involuntary and total panic .
There is absolutely nothing you can do about it .
It would be like telling you not to blink while I stuck a hot needle in your eye .
At the time my lungs emptied and I began to draw water , I would have sold my children to escape .
There was no choice , or chance , and willpower was not involved .
I never felt anything like it , and this was self - inflicted with a watering can , where I was in total control and never in any danger .
And I understood .
Waterboarding gets you to the point where you draw water up your respiratory tract triggering the drowning reflex .
Once that happens , it ’s all over .
No question .
Some may go easy without a rag , some may need a rag , some may need saran wrap .
Once you are there it ’s all over .
I did n’t allow anybody else to try it on me .
Inconceivable .
I know I only got the barest taste of what it ’s about since I was in control , and not restrained and controlling the flow of water .
But there ’s no chance .
No chance at all .
So , is it torture ?
I ’ll put it this way .
If I had the choice of being waterboarded by a third party or having my fingers smashed one at a time by a sledgehammer , I ’d take the fingers , no question .
It ’s horrible , terrible , inhuman torture .
I can hardly imagine worse .
I ’d prefer permanent damage and disability to experiencing it again .
I ’d give up anything , say anything , do anything .
The Spanish Inquisition knew this .
It was one of their favorite methods .
It ’s torture .
No question .
Terrible terrible torture .
To experience it and understand it and then do it to another human being is to leave the realm of sanity and humanity forever .
No question in my mind .
Questions ?
Doubts ?
P.S. Yes , I really did try it .
P.S.S. I understand that I took a shot or two at some other posters , but my hope is that this will be construed as humorous rather than genuinely insulting , and thus acceptable .
If any offended parties take genuine issue , my sincere apologies , but I chose targets that I thought would appreciate rather than be offended .
Vx32 : Lightweight , User - level Sandboxing on the x86
Bryan Ford and Russ Cox
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
{ baford , rsc}@pdos.csail.mit.edu
Code sandboxing is useful for many purposes , but most sandboxing techniques require kernel modifications , do not completely isolate guest code , or incur substantial performance costs .
Vx32 is a multipurpose user - level sandbox that enables any application to load and safely execute one or more guest plug-ins , confining each guest to a system call API controlled by the host application and to a restricted memory region within the host ’s address space .
Vx32 runs guest code efficiently on several widespread operating systems without kernel extensions or special privileges ; it protects the host program from both reads and writes by its guests ; and it allows the host to restrict the instruction set available to guests .
The key to vx32 ’s combination of portability , flexibility , and efficiency is its use of x86 segmentation hardware to sandbox the guest ’s data accesses , along with a lightweight instruction translator to sandbox guest instructions .
We evaluate vx32 using microbenchmarks and whole system benchmarks , and we examine four applications based on vx32 : an archival storage system , an extensible public - key infrastructure , an experimental user - level operating system running atop another host OS , and a Linux system call jail .
The first three applications export custom APIs independent of the host OS to their guests , making their plug-ins binary - portable across host systems .
Compute - intensive workloads for the first two applications exhibit between a 30 % slowdown and a 30 % speedup on vx32 relative to native execution ; speedups result from vx32 ’s instruction translator improving the cache locality of guest code .
The experimental user - level operating system allows the use of the guest OS ’s applications alongside the host ’s native applications and runs faster than whole - system virtual machine monitors such as VMware and QEMU .
The Linux system call jail incurs up to 80 % overhead but requires no kernel modifications and is delegation - based , avoiding concurrency vulnerabilities present in other interposition mechanisms .

A sandbox is a mechanism by which a host software system may execute arbitrary guest code in a confined environment , so that the guest code cannot compromise or affect the host other than according to a well - defined policy .
Sandboxing is useful for many purposes , such as running untrusted Web applets within a browser [ 6 ] , safely extending operating system kernels [ 5,32 ] , and limiting potential damage caused by compromised applications [ 19,22 ] .
Most sandboxing mechanisms , however , either require guest code to be ( re -) written in a type - safe language [ 6,5 ] , depend on special OS - specific facilities [ 19,18,15,8 ] , allow guest code unrestricted read access to the host ’s state [ 42,29 ] , or entail a substantial performance cost [ 33,34,37 ] .
Vx32 is a lightweight sandbox for the x86 architecture that enables applications to run untrusted code efficiently on standard operating systems without requiring special privileges or kernel extensions .
The vx32 sandbox runs standard x86 instructions , so guest code may be written in any language including assembly language , and may use advanced processor features such as vector ( SSE ) instructions .
An application may host multiple sandbox instances at once ; vx32 gives each guest its own dynamically movable and resizable address space within the host ’s space .
Vx32 confines both guest reads and guest writes to the guest ’s designated address region in the host , protecting both the host ’s integrity and the privacy of any sensitive data ( e.g. , SSL keys ) it may hold in its address space .
Vx32 confines each guest ’s system calls to an API completely determined by the host application .
The guest system call API need not have any relationship to that of the host operating system , so the host application can keep its guest environments independent of and portable across host operating systems .
The key to vx32 ’s combination of flexibility and efficiency is to use different mechanisms to sandbox data accesses and instruction execution .
Vx32 sandboxes guest data accesses using the x86 processor ’s segmentation hardware , by loading a special data segment into the ds , es , and ss registers before executing guest code .
Accessing data through this segment automatically confines both reads and writes to the guest ’s designated address region , with no performance overhead since the processor always performs segment translation anyway .
Since the vx32 sandbox runs entirely in user mode , however , vx32 cannot rely on the processor ’s privilege level mechanism for example , the x86 privilege levels alone would not prevent the guest from changing the segment registers .
Vx32 therefore prevents guest code from executing “ unsafe ” instructions such as segment register loads by using dynamic instruction translation [ 9,34 ] , rewriting each guest code sequence into a “ safe ” form before executing it .
This dynamic translation incurs some performance penalty , especially on control flow instructions , which vx32 must rewrite to keep execution confined to its cache of safe , rewritten code .
Since vx32 confines data accesses via segmentation , it does not need to rewrite most computation instructions , leaving safe code sequences as compact and efficient as the guest ’s original code .
Vx32 ’s on - demand translation can in fact improve the cache locality of the guest code , sometimes resulting in better performance than the original code , as seen previously in dynamic optimization systems [ 4 ] .
Because common OS kernels already provide user - level access to the x86 segmentation hardware , vx32 does not require any special privileges or kernel extensions in order to fully sandbox all memory reads and writes that guest code performs .
Vx32 is implemented as a library that runs on Linux , FreeBSD , and Mac OS X and is being used in several applications .
VXA [ 13 ] is an archival storage system that stores executable decoders along with compressed content in archives , using vx32 to run these decoders at extraction time ; thus the archives are “ self - extracting ” but also safe and OS - independent .
Alpaca [ 24 ] is an extensible PKI framework based on proof - carrying authorization [ 3 ] that uses vx32 to execute cryptographic algorithms such as SHA - 1 [ 12 ] that form components of untrusted PKI extensions .
Plan 9 VX is a port of the Plan 9 operating system [ 35 ] to user space : Plan 9 kernel code runs as a user - level process atop another OS , and unmodified Plan 9 user applications run under the Plan 9 kernel ’s control inside vx32 .
Vxlinux is a delegation - based system call interposition tool for Linux .
All of these applications rely on vx32 to provide near - native performance : if an extension mechanism incurs substantial slowdown , then in practice most users will forego extensibility in favor of faster but less flexible schemes .
Previous papers on VXA [ 13 ] and Alpaca [ 24 ] briefly introduced and evaluated vx32 in the context of those applications .
This paper focuses on the vx32 virtual machine itself , describing its sandboxing technique in detail and analyzing its performance over a variety of applications , host operating systems , and hardware .
On real applications , vx32 consistently executes guest code within a factor of two of native performance ; often the overhead is just a few percent .
This paper first describes background and related work in Section 2 , then presents the design of vx32 in Section 3 .
Section 4 evaluates vx32 on its own , then Section 5 evaluates vx32 in the context of the above four applications , and Section 6 concludes .
2. Related Work
Many experimental operating system architectures permit one user process to isolate and confine others to enforce a “ principle of least privilege ” : examples include capability systems [ 25 ] , L3 ’s clan / chief model [ 26 ] , Fluke ’s nested process architecture [ 14 ] , and generic software wrappers [ 15 ] .
The primary performance cost of kernel - mediated sandboxes like these is that of traversing hardware protection domains , though with careful design this cost can be minimized [ 27 ] .
Other systems permit the kernel itself to be extended with untrusted code , via domain - specific languages [ 31 ] , type - safe languages [ 5 ] , proof - carrying code [ 32 ] , or special kernel - space protection mechanisms [ 40 ] .
The main challenge in all of these approaches is deploying a new operating system architecture and migrating applications to it .
Other work has retrofitted existing kernels with sandboxing mechanisms for user processes , even taking advantage of x86 segments much as vx32 does [ 8 ] .
These mechanisms still require kernel modifications , however , which are not easily portable even between different x86 - based OSes .
In contrast , vx32 operates entirely in user space and is easily portable to any operating system that provides standard features described in Section 3 .
System call interposition , a sandboxing method implemented by Janus [ 19 ] and similar systems [ 18,22,7,36,17 ] , requires minor modifications to existing kernels to provide a means for one user process to filter or handle selected system calls made by another process .
Since the sandboxed process ’s system calls are still fielded by the host OS before being redirected to the user - level “ supervisor ” process , system call interposition assumes that the sandboxed process uses the same basic system call API as the host OS : the supervisor process cannot efficiently export a completely different ( e.g. , OS - independent ) API to the sandboxed process as a vx32 host application can .
Some system call interposition methods also have concurrency - related security vulnerabilities [ 16,43 ] , whose only clear solution is delegation - based interposition [ 17 ] .
Although vx32 has other uses , it can be used is to implement efficient delegation - based system call interposition , as described in Section 5.4 .
Virtualization has been in use for decades for purposes such as sharing resources [ 10 ] and migrating applications to new operating systems [ 20 ] .
Since the x86 architecture did not provide explicit support for virtualization until recently , x86 - based virtual machines such as VMware [ 1 ] had to use dynamic instruction translation to run guest kernel code in an unprivileged environment while simulating the appearance of being run in privileged mode : the dynamic translator rewrites instructions that might reveal the current privilege level .
Virtual machines usually do not translate user - mode guest code , relying instead on host kernel extensions to run user - mode guest code directly in a suitably constructed execution environment .
As described in Section 5.3 , vx32 ’s dynamic translation can be used to construct virtual machines that need no host kernel extensions , at some performance cost .
Dynamic instruction translation is frequently used for purposes other than sandboxing , such as dynamic optimization [ 4 ] , emulating other hardware platforms [ 9,44 ] or code instrumentation and debugging [ 28,34 ] .
The latter two uses require much more complex code transformations than vx32 performs , with a correspondingly larger performance cost [ 37 ] .
A software fault isolation ( SFI ) system [ 42,29 ] statically transforms guest code , preprocessing it to create a specialized version in which it is easy for the verifier to check that all data write instructions write only to a designated “ guest ” address range , and that control transfer instructions branch only to “ safe ” code entrypoints .
SFI originally assumed a RISC architecture [ 42 ] , but PittSFIeld adapted SFI to the x86 architecture [ 29 ] .
SFI ’s preprocessing eliminates the need for dynamic instruction translation at runtime but increases program code size : e.g. , 60 %- 100 % for PittSFIeld .
For efficiency , SFI implementations typically sandbox only writes and branches , not reads , so the guest can freely examine host code and data .
This may be unacceptable if the host application holds sensitive data such as passwords or SSL keys .
The main challenge in SFI on x86 is the architecture ’s variable - length instructions : opcode sequences representing unsafe instructions might appear in the middle of legitimate , safe instructions .
PittSFIeld addresses this problem by inserting no - ops so that all branch targets are 16 - byte aligned and then ensures that branches clear the bottom four bits of the target address .
MiSFIT [ 39 ] sidesteps this problem for direct jumps by loading only code that was assembled and cryptographically signed by a trusted assembler .
Indirect jumps consult a hash table listing valid jump targets .
Applications can use type - safe languages such as Java [ 6 ] or C# [ 30 ] to implement sandboxing completely in user space .
This approach requires guest code to be written in a particular language , making it difficult to reuse existing legacy code or use advanced processor features such as vector instructions ( SSE ) to improve the performance of compute - intensive code .
3. The Vx32 Virtual Machine
The vx32 virtual machine separates data sandboxing from code sandboxing , using different , complementary mechanisms for each : x86 segmentation hardware to sandbox data references and dynamic instruction translation to sandbox code .
The dynamic instruction translation prevents malicious guest code from escaping the data sandbox .
Vx32 ’s dynamic translation is simple and lightweight , rewriting only indirect branches and replacing unsafe instructions with virtual traps .
The use of dynamic translation also makes it possible for client libraries to restrict the instruction set further .
This section describes the requirements that vx32 places on its context — the processor , operating system , and guest code — and then explains the vx32 design .
3.1 . Requirements
Processor architecture .
Vx32 is designed around the x86 architecture , making the assumption that most systems now and in the foreseeable future are either x86 - based or will be able to emulate x86 code efficiently .
This assumption appears reasonable in the current desktop and server computing market , although it may prevent vx32 from spreading easily into other domains , such as game consoles and handheld mobile devices .
Vx32 uses protected - mode segmentation , which has been integral to the x86 architecture since before its extension to 32 bits [ 21 ] .
The recent 64 - bit extension of the architecture disables segment translation in 64 - bit code , but still provides segmentation for 32 - bit code [ 2 ] .
Vx32 therefore cannot use segmentation - based data sandboxing to run 64 - bit guest code , but it can still run 32 - bit sandboxed guest code within a 64 - bit host application .
Host operating system .
Vx32 requires that the host OS provide a method of inserting custom segment descriptors into the application ’s local descriptor table ( LDT ) , as explained below .
The host OS can easily and safely provide this service to all applications , provided it checks and restricts the privileges of custom segments .
All widely - used x86 operating systems have this feature .
1
To catch and isolate exceptions caused by guest code , vx32 needs to register its own signal handlers for processor exceptions such as segmentation faults and floating point exceptions .
For full functionality and robustness , the host OS must allow vx32 to handle these signals on a separate signal stack , passing vx32 the full saved register state when such a signal occurs .
Again , all widely - used x86 operating systems have this capability .
Finally , vx32 can benefit from being able to map disk files into the host application ’s address space and to control the read / write / execute permissions on individual pages in the mapping .
Although these features are not strictly required by vx32 , they are , once again , provided by all widely - used x86 operating systems .
On modern Unix variants such as Linux , FreeBSD , and OS X , specific system calls satisfying the above requirements are modify_ldt / i386_set_ldt , sigaction , sigaltstack , mmap , and mprotect .
Windows NT , 2000 , and XP support equivalent system calls , though we have not ported vx32 to Windows .
We have not examined whether Windows Vista retains this functionality .
Guest code .
Although vx32 uses x86 segmentation for data sandboxing , it assumes that guest code running in the sandbox conforms to the 32 - bit “ flat model ” and makes no explicit reference to segment registers .
In fact , vx32 rewrites any guest instructions referring to segment registers so that they raise a virtual illegal instruction exception .
This “ flat model ” assumption is reasonable for practically all modern , compiled 32 - bit x86 code ; it would typically be a problem only if , for example , the sandboxed guest wished to run 16 - bit DOS or Windows code or wished to run a nested instance of vx32 itself .
Some modern multithreading libraries use segment registers to provide quick access to thread - local storage ( TLS ) ; such libraries cannot be used in guest code under the current version of vx32 , but this is not a fundamental limitation of the approach .
Vx32 could be enhanced to allow guest code to create new segments using emulation techniques , perhaps at some performance cost .
Host applications may impose further restrictions on guest code through configuration flags that direct vx32 to reject specific classes of instructions .
For example , for consistent behavior across processor implementations , the VXA archiver described in Section 5.1 disallows the non-deterministic 387 floating - point instructions , forcing applications to use deterministic SSE - based equivalents .
3.2 . Data sandboxing : segmentation
In the x86 architecture , segmentation is an address translation step that the processor applies immediately before page translation .
In addition to the eight general - purpose registers ( GPRs ) accessible in user mode , the processor provides six segment registers .
During any memory access , the processor uses the value in one of these segment registers as an index into one of two segment translation tables , the global descriptor table ( GDT ) or local descriptor table ( LDT ) .
The GDT traditionally describes segments shared by all processes , while the LDT contains segments specific to a particular process .
Upon finding the appropriate descriptor table entry , the processor checks permission bits ( read , write , and execute ) and compares the virtual address of the requested memory access against the segment limit in the descriptor table , throwing an exception if any of these checks fail .
Finally , the processor adds the segment base to the virtual address to form the linear address that it subsequently uses for page translation .
Thus , a normal segment with base b and limit l permits memory accesses at virtual addresses between 0 and l , and maps these virtual addresses to linear addresses from b to b+l .
Today ’s x86 operating systems typically make segmentation translation a no - op by using a base of 0 and a limit of 2 32 - 1 .
Even in this so - called “ flat model , ” the processor continues to perform segmentation translation : it can not be disabled .
Vx32 allocates two segments in the host application ’s LDT for each guest instance : a guest data segment and a guest control segment , as depicted in Figure 1 .
The guest data segment corresponds exactly to the guest instance ’s address space : the segment base points to the beginning of the address space ( address 0 in the guest instance ) , and the segment size is the guest ’s address space size .
Vx32 executes guest code with the processor ’s ds , es , and ss registers holding the selector for the guest data segment , so that data reads and writes performed by the guest access this segment by default .
( Code sandboxing , described below , ensures that guest code cannot override this default . )
The segmentation hardware ensures that the address space appears at address 0 in the guest and that the guest cannot access addresses past the end of the segment .
The translation also makes it possible for the host to unmap a guest ’s address space when it is not in use and remap it later at a different host address , to relieve congestion in the host ’s address space for example .
The format of the guest data segment is up to vx32 ’s client : vx32 only requires that it be a contiguous , page - aligned range of virtual memory within the host address space .
Vx32 provides a loader for ELF executables [ 41 ] , but clients can load guests by other means .
For example , Plan 9 VX ( see section 5.3 ) uses mmap and mprotect to implement demand loading of Plan 9 executables .
The guest control segment , shown in Figure 2 , contains the data needed by vx32 during guest execution .
The segment begins with a fixed data structure containing saved host registers and other data .
The entrypoint hash table and code fragment cache make up most of the segment .
The hash table maps guest virtual addresses to code sequences in the code fragment cache .
The translated code itself needs to be included in the guest control segment so that vx32 can write to it when patching previously - translated unconditional branches to jump directly to their targets [ 38 ] .
Vx32 executes guest code with the processor ’s fs or gs register holding the selector for the guest control segment .
The vx32 runtime accesses the control segment by specifying a segment override on its data access instructions .
Whether vx32 uses fs or gs depends on the host system , as described in the next section .
3.3 . Code sandboxing : dynamic translation
Data sandboxing ensures that , using the proper segments , data reads and writes cannot escape the guest ’s address space .
Guests could still escape using segment override prefixes or segment register loads , however , which are unprivileged x86 operations .
Vx32 therefore uses code scanning and dynamic translation to prevent guest code from performing such unsafe operations .
As in Valgrind [ 34 ] and just - in - time compilation [ 11,23 ] , vx32 ’s code scanning and translation is fully dynamic and runs on demand .
The guest is allowed to place arbitrary code sequences in its address space , but vx32 never executes this potentially - unsafe code directly .
Instead , whenever vx32 enters a guest instance , it translates a fragment of code starting at the guest ’s current instruction pointer ( eip ) to produce an equivalent safe fragment in vx32 ’s code fragment cache , which lies outside the guest ’s address space .
Vx32 also records the eip and address of the translated fragment in the entrypoint hash table for reuse if the guest branches to that eip again .
Finally , vx32 jumps to the translated code fragment ; after executing , the fragment either returns control to vx32 or jumps directly to the next translated fragment .
On 32 - bit hosts , vx32 never changes the code segment register ( cs ) : it jumps directly to the appropriate fragment in the guest ’s code fragment cache .
This is safe because the code fragment cache only contains safe translations generated by vx32 itself .
The code translator ensures that all branches inside translated code only jump to the beginning of other translated fragments or back to vx32 to handle events like indirect branches or virtualized guest system calls .
On 64 - bit hosts , since segmentation only operates while executing 32 - bit code , vx32 must create a special 32 - bit code segment mapping the low 4GB of the host address space for use when running guest code .
The guest control and data segments must therefore reside in the low 4GB of the host address space on such systems , although other host code and data may be above 4GB .
Because vx32 never executes code in the guest ’s address space directly , vx32 requires no static preprocessing or verification of guest code before it is loaded , in contrast with most other sandboxing techniques .
Indeed , reliably performing static preprocessing and verification is problematic on the x86 due to the architecture ’s variable - length instructions [ 39,29 ] .
Translation overview .
Vx32 ’s translation of guest code into code fragments is a simple procedure with four stages : scan , simplify , place , and emit .
The stages share a “ hint table ” containing information about each instruction in the fragment being translated .
The eventual output is both the translated code and the hint table , which the translator saves for later use by exception handlers .
Scan .
The translator first scans guest code starting at the desired eip , decoding x86 instructions to determine their lengths and any required transformations .
The translator scans forward until it reaches an unconditional branch or a fragment size limit ( currently about 128 bytes of instructions ) .
The scan phase records the length , original offset , instruction type , and worst - case translated size in the hint table .
Jumps are the only instructions whose translated size is not known exactly at this point .
Simplify .
The next phase scans the hint table for direct branches within the fragment being translated ; it marks the ones that can be translated into short intrafragment branches using 8 - bit jump offsets .
After this phase , the hint table contains the exact size of the translation for each original guest instruction .
Place .
Using the now - exact hint table information , the translator computes the exact offset of each instruction ’s translation .
These offsets are needed to emit intrafragment branches in the last phase .
Emit .
The final phase writes the translation into the code fragment cache .
For most instructions , the translation is merely a copy of the original instruction ; for “ unsafe ” guest instructions , the translation is an appropriate sequence chosen by vx32 .
Vx32 saves the hint table , at a cost of four bytes per original instruction , in the code fragment cache alongside each translation , for use in exception handling as described in Section 3.4 .
The hint table could be discarded and recomputed during exception handling , trading exception handling performance for code cache space .
The rest of this section discusses specific types of guest instructions .
Figure 3 shows concrete examples .
(a) An indirect jump to the address stored at 08049248 : 08048160 jmp [ 0x08049248 ] b7d8d0f9 mov ebx , fs : [ 0x2c ] b7d8d100 mov fs :[ 0x2c ] , ebx b7d8d107 mov ebx , [ 0x08049248 ] b7d8d10d jmp vxrun_lookup_indirect
The fs segment register points to the guest control segment .
The first line of every translated code fragment is a prologue that restores the guest ’s ebx ( at b7d8d0f9 in this case ) , because vx32 jumps into a fragment using a jmp [ ebx ] instruction .
The translation of the jmp instruction itself begins on the second line ( at b7d8d100 ) .
The translated code saves ebx back into the guest control segment , loads the target eip into ebx , and then jumps to vxrun_lookup_indirect , which locates and jumps to the cached fragment for the guest address in ebx .
The first two lines cannot be optimized out : other fragments may directly jump past the first instruction , as shown below .
( b) A direct jump to 08048080 : 08048160 jmp 0x08048080 b7d8d0f9 mov ebx , fs :[ 0x2c ] b7d8d100 jmp 0xb7d8d105 b7d8d105 mov fs :[ 0x5c ] , 0x00008115 b7d8d110 jmp vxrun_lookup_backpatch b7d8d115 dword 0x08048080 b7d8d119 dword 0xb7d8d105
The first jmp in the translation is initially a no - op that just jumps to the next instruction , but vxrun_lookup_backpatch will rewrite it to avoid subsequent lookups .
The word stored into fs : [ 0x5c ] is an fs - relative offset telling vxrun_lookup_backpatch where in the control segment to find the two dwords arguments at b7d8d115 .
The control segment for the guest begins at b7d85000 in this example .
The first argument is the target eip ; the second is the address of the end of the 32 - bit jump offset to be patched .
Since ebx has not been spilled at the point of the jump , vxrun_lookup_backpatch patches the jump to skip the one - instruction prologue in the target fragment that restores ebx .
( c) A return instruction : 08048160 ret b7d8d0f9 mov ebx , fs : [ 0x2c ] b7d8d100 mov fs : [ 0x2c ] , ebx b7d8d107 pop ebx b7d8d108 jmp vxrun_lookup_indirect
A return is an indirect jump to an address popped off the stack .
( d) An indirect call : 08048160 call [ 0x08049248 ] b7d8d0f9 mov ebx , fs : [ 0x2c ] b7d8d100 mov fs :[ 0x2c ] , ebx b7d8d107 mov ebx , [ 0x08049248 ] b7d8d10d push 0x08048166 b7d8d112 jmp vxrun_lookup_indirect
The translation is almost identical to the one in ( a ) .
The added push instruction saves the guest return address onto the stack .
(e) A direct call : 08048160 call 0x8048080 b7d8d0f9 mov ebx , fs :[ 0x2c ] b7d8d100 push 0x8048165 b7d8d105 jmp 0xb7d8d10a b7d8d10a mov fs :[ 0x5c ] , 0x0000811a b7d8d115 jmp vxrun_lookup_backpatch b7d8d11a dword 0x08048080 b7d8d11e dword 0xb7d8d10a
The translation is identical to the one in ( b ) except for the addition of the push that saves the return address .
( f) A software interrupt : 08048160 int 0x30 b7d8d0f9 mov ebx , fs : [ 0x2c ] b7d8d100 mov fs :[ 0x20 ] , eax b7d8d106 mov eax , 0x230 b7d8d10b mov fs :[ 0x40 ] , 0x8048162 b7d8d116 jmp vxrun_gentrap
The translation saves the guest eax into the guest control segment , loads the virtual trap number into eax ( the 0x200 bit indicates an int instruction ) , saves the next eip into the guest control segment , and then jumps to the virtual trap handler , which will stop the execution loop and return from vx32 , letting the library ’s caller handle the trap .
( g ) An unsafe or illegal instruction : 08048160 mov ds , ax b7d8d0f9 mov ebx , fs : [ 0x2c ] b7d8d100 mov fs :[ 0x20 ] , eax b7d8d106 mov eax , 0x006 b7d8d10b mov fs :[ 0x40 ] , 0x8048160 b7d8d116 jmp vxrun_gentrap
The translation generates a virtual trap with code 0x006 .
In contrast with ( f ) , for illegal instructions the saved eip points at the guest instruction itself rather than just past it .
Computational code .
Translation leaves most instructions intact .
All ordinary computation and data access instructions ( add , mov , and so on ) and even floating - point and vector instructions are “ safe ” from vx32 ’s perspective , requiring no translation , because the segmentation hardware checks all data reads and writes performed by these instructions against the guest data segment ’s limit .
The only computation instructions that vx32 does not permit the guest to perform directly are those with x86 segment override prefixes , which change the segment register used to interpret memory addresses and could thus be used to escape the data sandbox .
Guest code may freely use all eight general - purpose registers provided by the x86 architecture : vx32 avoids both the dynamic register renaming and spilling of translation engines like Valgrind [ 34 ] and the static register usage restrictions of SFI [ 42 ] .
Allowing guest code to use all the registers presents a practical challenge for vx32 , however : it leaves no general - purpose register available where vx32 can store the address of the saved host registers for use while entering or exiting guest code .
As mentioned above , vx32 solves this problem by placing the information in the guest control segment and using an otherwise - unused segment register ( fs or gs ) to address it .
( Although vx32 does not permit segment override prefixes in guest code , it is free to insert them for its own use in the code fragment translations . )
It is common nowadays for thread libraries to use one of these two segment registers — fs or gs — as a pointer to thread - local storage .
If vx32 reused the thread - local segment register , it would have to restore the segment register before calling any thread - aware library routines , including routines that perform locking , such as printf .
On recent GCC - based systems , the thread - local segment register is even used in function call prologues to look up the stack limit during a stack overflow check .
Also , some 64 - bit x86 operating systems ( e.g. , Linux ) use privileged instructions to initialize the thread - local segment register with a base that is impossible to represent in an ordinary 32 - bit segment descriptor .
On such systems , restoring the thread - local segment register would require a system call , increasing the cost of exiting guest code .
For these reasons , vx32 uses whichever segment register is not being used by the host OS ’s thread library .
With care , vx32 could share the thread library ’s segment register .
Control transfers .
To keep guest execution safely confined to its cache of translated code fragments , vx32 must ensure that all control transfer instructions — calls , jumps , and returns — go to vx32 - generated translations , not to the original , unsafe guest code .
In the worst case , a control transfer must search the translation hash table , invoking the instruction translator if no translation exists .
Once a translation has been found , vx32 can rewrite or “ patch ” direct jumps and direct calls to avoid future lookups [ 34,38 ] .
To implement this patching , the instruction translator initially translates each fixed - target jump or call instruction to jump to a stub that invokes the hash table lookup and branch patching function .
The branch patching function looks up the target address and then rewrites the jump or call instruction to transfer directly to the target translation .
Patching cannot be used for indirect branches , including indirect calls and returns .
This hash table lookup for indirect branches , especially during return instructions , is the main source of slowdown in vx32 .
Other dynamic translation systems optimize indirect branches by caching the last target of each indirect branch and the corresponding translation address , or by maintaining a cache of subroutine return targets analogous to what many modern processors do [ 37 ] .
Such optimizations would be unlikely to benefit vx32 : its indirect target lookup path is only 21 instructions in the common case of an immediate hash table hit .
Only the would be eliminated by using a single - entry branch cache .
Most of the other instructions , which save and restore the x86 condition code flags and a few guest registers to give the target lookup code “ room to work , ” would still be required no matter how simple the lookup itself .
Traps .
Vx32 translates instructions like int , syscall , and sysenter , which normally generate hardware traps , into code sequences that generate virtual traps instead : they record the trap code and then cause vx32 to return to its caller , allowing the host application to handle the trap as it wishes .
Typical applications look for a specific trap code to interpret as a “ virtual system call ” and treat any other trap as reason to terminate the guest .
Privileged or unsafe instructions .
Vx32 translates privileged or unsafe instructions ( for example , kernel - mode instructions or those user - mode instructions that manipulate the segment registers ) into sequences that generate ( virtual ) illegal instruction traps .
3.4 . Exception handling
With help from the host OS , vx32 catches processor exceptions in guest code — for example , and turns them into virtual traps , returning control to the host application with full information about the exception that occurred .
Since the eip reported by the host OS on such an exception points into one of vx32 ’s code translations , vx32 must translate this eip back to the corresponding eip in the guest ’s original instruction stream in order for it to make sense to the host application or the developer .
To recover this information , vx32 first locates the translation fragment containing the current eip and converts the eip ’s offset within the fragment to an offset from the guest code address corresponding to the fragment .
To locate the translation fragment containing the trapping eip efficiently , vx32 organizes the code fragment cache into two sections as shown earlier in Figure 2 : the code translations and instruction offset tables are allocated from the bottom up , and the fragment index is allocated from the top down .
The top - down portion of the cache is thus a table of all the translation fragments , sorted in reverse order by fragment address .
The exception handler uses a binary search in this table to find the fragment containing a particular eip as well as the hint table constructed during translation .
Once vx32 ’s exception handler has located the correct fragment , it performs a second binary search , this one in the fragment ’s hint table , to find the exact address of the guest instruction corresponding to the current eip .
Once the exception handler has translated the faulting eip , it can finally copy the other guest registers unchanged and exit the guest execution loop , transferring control back to the host application to handle the fault .
3.5 . Usage
Vx32 is a generic virtual execution library ; applications decide how to use it .
Typically , applications use vx32 to execute guest code in a simple control loop : load a register set into the vx32 instance , and call vx32 ’s run function ; when run eventually returns a virtual trap code , handle the virtual trap ; repeat .
Diversity in vx32 applications arises from what meaning they assign to these traps .
Section 5 describes a variety of vx32 applications and evaluates vx32 in those contexts .
Vx32 allows the creation of multiple guest contexts that can be run independently .
In a multithreaded host application , different host threads can run different guest contexts simultaneously with no interference .
4. Vx32 Evaluation
This section evaluates vx32 in isolation , comparing vx32 ’s execution against native execution through microbenchmarks and whole - system benchmarks .
Section 5 evaluates vx32 in the context of real applications .
Both sections present experiments run on a variety of test machines , listed in Figure 4 .
4.1 . Implementation complexity
The vx32 sandbox library consists of 3,800 lines of C ( 1,500 semicolons ) and 500 lines of x86 assembly language .
The code translator makes up about half of the C code .
Vx32 runs on Linux , FreeBSD , and Mac OS X without kernel modifications or access to privileged operating system features .
In addition to the library itself , the vx32 system provides a GNU compiler toolchain and a BSD - derived C library for optional use by guests hosted by applications that provide a Unix - like system call interface .
Host applications are , of course , free to use their own compilers and libraries and to design new system call interfaces .
4.2 . Microbenchmarks
To understand vx32 ’s performance costs , we wrote a small suite of microbenchmarks exercising illustrative cases .
Figure 5 shows vx32 ’s performance on these tests .
Jump .
This benchmark repeats a sequence of 100 no - op short jumps .
Because a short jump is only two bytes , the targets are only aligned on 2 - byte boundaries .
In contrast , vx32 ’s generated fragments are aligned on 4 - byte boundaries .
The processors we tested vary in how sensitive they are to jump alignment , but almost all run considerably faster on vx32 ’s 4 - byte aligned jumps than the 2 - byte jumps in the native code .
The Pentium 4 and the Xeon are unaffected .
Jumpal .
This benchmark repeats a sequence of 100 short jumps that are spaced so that each jump target is aligned on a 16 - byte boundary .
Most processors execute vx32 ’s equivalent 4 - byte aligned jumps a little slower .
The Pentium 4 and Xeon are , again , unaffected .
Jumpfar .
This benchmark repeats a sequence of 100 jumps spaced so that each jump target is aligned on a 4096 - byte ( page ) boundary .
This is a particularly hard case for native execution , especially if the processor ’s instruction cache uses only the low 12 bits of the instruction address as the cache index .
Vx32 runs this case significantly faster on all processors , because of better instruction cache performance in the translation .
Call .
This benchmark repeatedly calls a function containing only a return instruction .
The call is a direct branch , though the return is still an indirect branch .
Callind .
This benchmark is the same as call , but the call is now an indirect branch , via a register .
Comparing the bars for call against the bars for callind may suggest that vx32 takes longer to execute direct function calls than indirect function calls , but only relative to the underlying hardware : a vx32 indirect call takes about twice as long as a vx32 direct call , while a native indirect call takes about four times as long as a native direct call .
The call bars are taller than the callind bars not because vx32 executes direct calls more slowly , but because native hardware executes them so much faster .
Nullrun .
This benchmark compares creating and executing a vx32 guest instance that immediately exits against forking a host process that immediately exits .
Syscall .
This benchmark compares a virtual system call relayed to the host system against the same system call executed natively .
( The system call is close ( - 1 ) , which should be trivial for the OS to execute . )
4.3 . Large - scale benchmarks
The microbenchmarks help to characterize vx32 ’s performance executing particular kinds of instructions , but the execution of real programs depends critically on how often the expensive instructions occur .
To test vx32 on real programs , we wrote a 500 - line host application called vxrun that loads ELF binaries [ 41 ] compiled for a generic Unix - like system call interface .
The system call interface is complete enough to support the SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmark programs , which we ran both using vx32 ( vxrun ) and natively .
We ran only the C integer benchmarks ; we excluded 403.gcc and 429.mcf because they caused our test machines , most of which have only 1GB of RAM , to swap .
Figure 6 shows the performance of vx32 compared to the native system on five different 32 - bit x86 processors .
On three of the seven benchmarks , vx32 incurs a performance penalty of less than 10 % , yet on the other four , the penalty is 50 % or more .
The difference between these two groups is the relative frequency of indirect branches , which , as discussed in Section 3 , are the most expensive kind of instruction that vx32 must handle .
Figure 8 shows the percentage of indirect branches retired by our Pentium 4 system during each SPEC benchmark , obtained via the CPU ’s performance counters [ 21 ] .
The benchmarks that exhibit a high percentage of indirect call , jump , and return instructions are precisely those that suffer a high performance penalty under vx32 .
We also examined vx32 ’s performance running under a 32 - bit host operating system compared to a 64 - bit host operating system .
Figure 7 graphs the results .
Even under a 64 - bit operating system , the processor switches to 32 - bit mode when executing vx32 ’s 32 - bit code segments , so vx32 ’s execution time is essentially identical in each case .
Native 64 - bit performance often differs from 32 - bit performance , however : the x86 - 64 architecture ’s eight additional general - purpose registers can improve performance by requiring less register spilling in compiled code , but its larger pointer size can hurt performance by decreasing cache locality , and the balance between these factors depends on the workload .
5. Applications
In addition to evaluating vx32 in isolation , we evaluated vx32 in the context of several applications built using it .
This section evaluates the performance of these applications , but equally important is the ability to create them in the first place : vx32 makes it possible to create interesting new applications that execute untrusted x86 code on legacy operating systems without kernel modifications , at only a modest performance cost .
5.1 . Archival storage
VXA [ 13 ] is an archival storage system that uses vx32 to “ future proof ” compressed data archives against changes in data compression formats .
Data compression algorithms evolve much more rapidly than processor architectures , so VXA packages executable decoders into the compressed archives along with the compressed data itself .
Unpacking the archive in the future then depends only on being able to run on ( or simulate ) an x86 processor , not on having the original codecs used to compress the data and being able to run them natively on the latest operating systems .
Crucially , archival storage systems need to be efficiently usable now as well as in the future : if “ future proofing ” an archive using sandboxed decoders costs too much performance in the short term , the archive system is unlikely to be used except by professional archivists .
VXA uses vx32 to implement a minimal system call API ( read , write , exit , sbrk ) .
Vx32 provides exactly what the archiver needs : it protects the host from buggy or malicious archives , it isolates the decoders from the host ’s system call API so that archives are portable across operating systems and OS versions , and it executes decoders efficiently enough that VXA can be used as a general - purpose archival storage system without noticeable slowdown .
To ensure that VXA decoders behave identically on all platforms , VXA instructs vx32 to disable inexact instructions like the 387 intrinsics whose precise results vary from one processor to another ; VXA decoders simply use SSE and math library equivalents .
Figure 9 shows the performance of vx32 - based decoders compared to native ones on the four test architectures .
All run within 30 % of native performance , often much closer .
The jpeg decoder is consistently faster under vx32 than natively , due to better cache locality .
5.2 . Extensible public key infrastructure
Alpaca [ 24 ] is an extensible public - key infrastructure ( PKI ) and authorization framework built on the idea of proof - carrying authorization ( PCA ) [ 3 ] , in which one party authenticates itself to another by using an explicit logical language to prove that it deserves a particular kind of access or is authorized to request particular services .
PCA systems before Alpaca assumed a fixed set of cryptographic algorithms , such as public - key encryption , signature , and hash algorithms .
Alpaca moves these algorithms into the logical language itself , so that the extensibility of PCA extends not just to delegation policy but also to complete cryptographic suites and certificate formats .
Unfortunately , cryptographic algorithms like round - based hash functions are inefficient to express and evaluate explicitly using Alpaca ’s proof language .
Alpaca uses Python bindings for the vx32 sandbox to support native implementations of expensive algorithms like hashes , which run as untrusted “ plug- ins ” that are fully isolated from the host system .
The lightweight sandboxing vx32 provides is again crucial to the application , because an extensible public - key infrastructure is unlikely to be used in practice if it makes all cryptographic operations orders of magnitude slower than native implementations would be .
Figure 10 shows the performance of vx32 - based hash functions compared to native ones .
All run within 25 % of native performance .
One surprise is the Core 2 Duo ’s excellent performance , especially on whirlpool .
We believe the Core 2 Duo is especially sensitive to cache locality .
5.3 . Plan 9 VX
Plan 9 VX ( 9vx for short ) is a port of the Plan 9 operating system [ 35 ] to run on top of commodity operating systems , allowing the use of both Plan 9 and the host system simultaneously and also avoiding the need to write hardware drivers .
To run user programs , 9vx creates an appropriate address space in a window within its own address space and invokes vx32 to simulate user mode execution .
Where a real kernel would execute iret to enter user mode and wait for the processor to trap back into kernel mode , 9vx invokes vx32 to simulate user mode , waiting for it to return with a virtual trap code .
9vx uses a temporary file as a simulation of physical memory , calling the host mmap and mprotect system calls to map individual memory pages as needed .
This architecture makes it possible to simulate Plan 9’s shared - memory semantics exactly , so that standard Plan 9 x86 binaries run unmodified under 9vx .
For example , Plan 9 threads have a shared address space except that each has a private stack .
This behavior is foreign to other systems and very hard to simulate directly .
Because all user - mode execution happens via vx32 , 9vx can implement this easily with appropriate memory mappings .
The most surprising aspect of 9vx ’s implementation was how few changes it required .
Besides removing the hardware drivers , it required writing about 1,000 lines of code to interface with vx32 , and another 500 to interface with the underlying host operating system .
The changes mainly have to do with page faults .
9vx treats vx32 like an architecture with a software - managed TLB ( the code was already present in Plan 9 to support architectures like the MIPS ) .
9vx unmaps all mapped pages during a process context switch ( a single munmap call ) and then remaps pages on demand during vx32 execution .
A fault on a missing page causes the host kernel to send 9vx a signal ( most often SIGSEGV ) , which causes vx32 to stop and return a virtual trap .
9vx handles the fault exactly as Plan 9 would and then passes control back to vx32 .
9vx preempts user processes by asking the host OS to deliver SIGALRM signals at regular intervals ; vx32 translates these signals into virtual clock interrupts .
To evaluate the performance of 9vx , we ran benchmarks on our Pentium M system in four configurations : native Plan 9 , 9vx on Linux , Plan 9 under VMware Workstation 6.0.2 ( build 59824 ) on Linux , and Plan 9 under QEMU on Linux with the kqemu module .
Figure 11 shows the results .
9vx is slower than Plan 9 at context switching , so switch - heavy workloads suffer ( swtch , pipe - byte , pipe - bulk ) .
System calls that do n’t context switch ( rdwr ) and ordinary computation ( sha1zero ) run at full speed under 9vx .
In fact , 9vx ’s simulation of system calls is faster than VMware ’s and QEMU ’s , because it does n’t require simulating the processor ’s entry into and exit from kernel mode .
File system access ( du , mk ) is also faster under 9vx than Plan 9 , because 9vx uses Linux ’s in - kernel file system while the other setups use Plan 9 ’s user - level file server .
User - level file servers are particularly expensive in VMware and QEMU due to the extra context switches .
We have not tested Plan 9 under VMware ESX server , which could be more efficient than VMware Workstation since it bypasses the host OS completely .
The new functionality 9vx creates is more important than its performance .
Using vx32 means that 9vx requires no special kernel support to make it possible to run Plan 9 programs and native Unix programs side - by - side , sharing the same resources .
This makes it easy to experiment with and use Plan 9’s features while avoiding the need to maintain hardware drivers and port large pieces of software ( such as web browsers ) to Plan 9 .
5.4 . Vxlinux
We implemented a 250 - line host application , vxlinux , that provides delegation - based interposition [ 17 ] by running unmodified , single - threaded Linux binaries under vx32 and relaying the guest ’s system calls to the host OS .
A complete interposition system would include a policy controlling which system calls to relay , but for now we merely wish to evaluate the basic interposition mechanism .
The benefit of vxlinux over the OS - independent vxrun ( described in Section 4 ) is that it runs unmodified Linux binaries without requiring recompilation for vx32 .
The downside is that since it implements system calls by passing arguments through to the Linux kernel , it can only run on Linux .
The performance of the SPEC benchmarks under vxlinux is essentially the same as the performance under vxrun ; we omit the graph .
6. Conclusion
Vx32 is a multipurpose user - level sandbox that enables any application to load and safely execute one or more guest plug-ins , confining each guest to a system call API controlled by the host application and to a restricted memory region within the host ’s address space .
It executes sandboxed code efficiently on x86 architecture machines by using the x86’s segmentation hardware to isolate memory accesses along with dynamic code translation to disallow unsafe instructions .
Vx32 ’s ability to sandbox untrusted code efficiently has enabled a variety of interesting applications : self - extracting archival storage , extensible public - key infrastructure , a user - level operating system , and portable or restricted execution environments .
Because vx32 works on widely - used x86 operating systems without kernel modifications , these applications are easy to deploy .
In the context of these applications ( and also on the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite ) , vx32 always delivers sandboxed execution performance within a factor of two of native execution .
Many programs execute within 10 % of the performance of native execution , and some programs execute faster under vx32 than natively .

Many American depositors in financial institutions take the guarantee of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as iron -clad .
The FDIC promises to cover the loss up to $ 100,000 per account if a covered institution is declared insolvent .
Let us examine whether the guarantee is valid .
FDIC is highly leveraged
As of December 31st , 2007 , the FDIC 's reserve ratio was only 1.22 % of Insured Deposits .
Now in my book , that is a lot of leverage .
The following table shows some statistics for the FDIC .
Net Operating income net of special assessments in 2007 was slightly over $ 2.1 billion .
Increasing Stress in Financial System
The important numbers are the increase in problem institutions since 2005 and that during 2007 , the FDIC closed only three institutions and the total assets of those institutions that failed in 2007 were only $ 2.3 billion .
So far in 2008 , the FDIC has closed five and the total assets were $ 32.3 billion , or 14 times higher .
The bank failures are :
2008 January Douglass National Bank , Kansas City , Missouri , with approximately $ 58.5 million in assets was closed .
Liberty Bank and Trust Company of New Orleans , Louisiana has agreed to assume all deposits ( approximately $ 53.8 million ) .
( PR - 7-2008 ) March Hume Bank , Hume , Missouri , with approximately $ 18.7 million in assets was closed .
Security Bank , Rich Hill , Missouri has agreed to assume the insured deposits ( approximately $ 12.5 million ) .
( PR-21-2008 ) May ANB Financial , National Association , Bentonville , Arkansas , with approximately $ 2.1 billion in assets was closed .
Pulaski Bank and Trust Company , Little Rock , Arkansas has agreed to assume the non-brokered insured deposits ( approximately $ 212.9 million ) .
( PR -33-2008 ) First Integrity Bank , National Association , Staples , Minnesota , with approximately $ 54.7 million in assets was closed .
First International Bank and Trust , Watford City , North Dakota has agreed to assume all deposits ( approximately $ 50.3 million ) .
( PR -41-2008 ) July IndyMac Bank , F.S.B. , Pasadena , California , with approximately $ 32.01 billion in assets was closed .
Non-brokered insured deposits and substantially all of the assets were transferred to IndyMac Federal Bank , F.S.B. , Pasadena , California .
The FDIC was named Conservator .
( PR -56-2008 )
The pace and size of bank failures appears to be increasing .
During the 1st Qtr 2008 , FDIC insured deposits increased 3.3 percent in the first quarter , and the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio fell to 1.19 % .
From the First Quarter 2008 Quarterly Banking Profile of the FDIC comes this :
FDIC - insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported net income of $ 19.3 billion in the first quarter of 2008 , a decline of $ 16.3 billion from the $ 35.6 billion that the industry earned in the first quarter of 2007 .
Insured institutions set aside $ 37.1 billion in loan - loss provisions during the quarter , as the asset quality of real estate portfolios continued to deteriorate .
The average return on assets ( ROA ) was 0.59 percent , falling from 1.20 percent in the first quarter of 2007 .
The FDIC is insuring a market sector whose earnings have fallen almost 50 % in one year and one in which no one really knows how bad the situation will become .
A prudent person might think that is a recipe for disaster .
Staff reductions will not continue so operating expenses will increase
The FDIC has been reducing its staff during the past several years .
Operating expenses which are primarily staffing expenses will surely be increasing as the number of troubled institutions rise and failures mount .
While the FDIC can increase its assessments on member institutions , any increase will also decrease profits of those institutions who are now struggling to remain afloat .
The 2007 FDIC annual report carried this interesting tidbit which now looks like the management of the FDIC did not have a clue as to what was going to happen in 2008 .
Cost Reductions Realized through Staff Reductions
Salary and benefits costs represent more than 60 percent of the FDIC 's annual Corporate Operating Budget .
Because compensation costs are so significant , the FDIC has engaged in a continuing effort to realign staffing to reflect reduced workload requirements as it has moved past the banking and thrift crisis .
Total FDIC staffing fell from 5,430 at the beginning of 2003 to 4,532 at year - end 2007 , a 17 percent reduction over five years .
As a result , aggregate spending for salaries and benefits decreased by 4 percent , from $ 666 million in 2003 to $ 639 million in 2007 , despite an increase of 16.9 percent in the salaries of individual employees during this period .
Credit Crisis is Increasing
Of course , the turmoil emanating from the sub - prime crisis was just beginning to cascade through the U.S. banking system .
With the write - downs of over $ 450 billion already on the books since August 2007 and more showing up every day , the capital structure of many institutions are getting dangerously close to insolvency as shown by the Bear Stearns and IndyMac situations .
The FDIC's First Quarter 2008 report was interesting in the lack of understanding of the credit crisis shown by its management and CFO .
In the report , the CFO stated that the fund would increase by $ 2.8 billion in 2008 and that the reserve ratio would increase to 1.25 % .
As we look forward into the second half of this year , those statements appear suspicious , at least .
The Entire Financial System is under stress
In fact , Non-borrowed Bank Reserves per the Federal Reserve Bank ( FED ) were in negative territory in April 2008 for the first time since the early 1930's when President Franklin D. Roosevelt closed down the banks and confiscated all the gold owned by U.S. citizens at $ 20 / oz .
and a few days later , revalued it at $ 35/ oz .
It was grand theft on a massive scale .
Could it happen again ... yes , as all the laws allowing Roosevelt to do it remain on the books .
Banks are required to maintain a portion of their deposits on reserve at the FED .
Hence , non -borrowed bank reserves should always be positive unless the system is insolvent .
Does anyone really know how big the write - downs will be ?
Some analysts are currently suggesting that the total write - downs world - wide could exceed $ 1.6 trillion .
With the new FASB rules requiring many institutions to bring back off - balance sheet transactions , the stage is set for further turmoil .
Many banks both in the U.S. and abroad are having trouble raising capital to shore up their balance sheets .
As liquidity disappears , the scene is set for further failures .
There is speculation as I write that Lehman Brothers , Wachovia , Merrill Lynch , Citibank , and many local and regional banks are in trouble .
Of course , JPM was the recipient of a $ 75 billion tax - payer gift from the take - over of Bear Stearns but it still has the highest leverage ratios in the world because of its huge derivative positions .
Do n't you find it interesting that both Goldman , Sachs and JP Morgan , Chase have the largest derivative positions and yet , have written down far less than many of their counter - parts ?
Some of these failures will end up with the FDIC liable for their guarantees .
Balance Sheet
The balance sheet of the FDIC as of December 31st is shown in the following table .
There are two important facts to note about the balance sheet .
Seventy - one percent ( 71 % ) of American voters know that Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat , but most do n’t know enough about other Congressional leaders to even hazard a guess .
The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey found that only 13 % of voters had never heard of Pelosi , the first woman to ever serve as Speaker of the House and the highest ranking Democrat in government today .
Rasmussen Reports is a media company specializing in the collection , publication and distribution of public opinion information .

More artificial Finnish
Several Finns wrote to me to explain in some detail what was wrong with the artificial Finnish in yesterday 's article .
As I surmised , the words " ssän " and " kkeen " are lexically illegal in Finnish .
There were a number of similar problems .
For example , my sample output included the non-word " t " .
I do n't know how this could have happened , since the input probably did n't include anything like that , and the Markov process I used to generate it should n't have done so .
But the code is lost , so I suppose I 'll never know .
Of the various comments I received , perhaps the most interesting was from Ilmari Vacklin . ( " Vacklin " , huh ?
If my program had generated " Vacklin " , the Finns would have been all over the error . )
M. Vacklin pointed out that a number of words in my sample output violated the Finnish rules of vowel harmony .
( M. Vacklin also suggested that my article must have been inspired by this comic , but it was n't .
I venture to guess that the Internet is full of places that point out that you can manufacture pseudo - Finnish by stringing together a lot of k's and a's and t's ; it 's not that hard to figure out .
Maybe this would be a good place to mention the word " saippuakauppias " , the Finnish term for a soap - dealer , which was in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest commonly - used palindromic word in any language . )
Anyway , back to vowel harmony .
Vowel harmony is a phenomenon found in certain languages , including Finnish .
These languages class vowels into two antithetical groups .
Vowels from one group never appear in the same word as vowels from the other group .
When one has a prefix or a suffix that normally has a group A vowel , and one wants to join it to a word with group B vowels , the vowel in the suffix changes to match .
This happens a lot in Finnish , which has a zillion suffixes .
In many languages , including Finnish , there is also a third group of vowels which are " neutral " and can be mixed with either group A or with group B. Modern Korean does not have vowel harmony , mostly , but Middle Korean did have it , up until the early 16th century .
The Korean alphabet was invented around 1443 , and the notation for the vowels reflected the vowel harmony : [ Addendum 20080517 :
The following paragraph about vowel harmony contains significant errors of fact .
I got the groups wrong . ]
The first four vowels in this illustration , with the vertical lines , were incompatible with the second four vowels , the ones with the horizontal lines .
The last two vowels were neutral , as was another one , not shown here , which was written as a single dot and which has since fallen out of use .
Incidentally , vowel harmony is an unusual feature of languages , and its presence in Korean has led some people to suggest that it might be distantly related to Turkish .
The vowel harmony thing is interesting in this context for the following reason .
My pseudo - Finnish was generated by a Markov process : each letter was selected at random so as to make the overall frequency of the output match that of real Finnish .
Similarly , the overall frequency of two - and three - letter sequences in pseudo - Finnish should match that in real Finnish .
Is this enough to generate plausible ( although nonsensical ) Finnish text ?
For English , we might say maybe .
But for Finnish the answer is no , because this process does not respect the vowel harmony rules .
The Markov process does n't remember , by the time it gets to the end of a long word , whether it is generating a word in vowel category A or B , and so it does n't know which vowels it whould be generating .
It will inevitably generate words with mixed vowels , which is forbidden .
This problem does not come up in the generation of pseudo - English .
None of that was what I was planning to write about , however .
What I wanted to do was to present samples of pseudo - Finnish generated with various tunings of the Markov process .
The basic model is this : you choose a number N , say 2 , and then you look at some input text .
For each different sequence of N characters , you count how many times that sequence is followed by " a " , how many times it is followed by " b " , and so on .
Then you start generating text at random .
You pick a sequence of N characters arbitrarily to start , and then you generate the next character according to the probabilities that you calculated .
Then you look at the last N characters ( the last N - 1 from before , plus the new one ) and repeat .
You keep doing that until you get tired .
For example , suppose we have N=2 .
Then we have a big table whose keys are 2 - character strings like " ab " , and then associated with each such string , a table that looks something like this : r 54.52 a 15.89 i 10.41 o 7.95 l 4.11 e 3.01 u 1.10 space 0.82 : 0.55 t 0.55 , 0.27 . 0.27 b 0.27 s 0.27
So in the input to this process , " ab " was followed by " r " more than 54 % of the time , by " a " about 16 % of the time , and so on .
And when generating the output , every time our process happens to generate " ab " , it will follow by generating an " r " 54.52 % of the time , an " a " 15.89 % of the time , and so on .
Whether to count capital letters as the same as lowercase , and what to do about punctuation and spaces and so forth , are up to the designer .
Here , as examples , are some samples of pseudo - English , generated with various N . The input text was the book of Genesis , which is not entirely typical .
In each case , I deleted the initial N characters and the final partial word , cleaned up the capitalization by hand , and appended a final period .

My and he behou spend the .
N=3 Sack one eved of and refor ther of the hand he will there that in the ful , when it up unto rangers .
It should be clear that the quality improves as one increases the N parameter .
The N=3 sample has mostly real words , and the few nonsense ones it contains ( " eved " , " ful " ) are completely plausible English .
N=2 , on the other hand , is mostly nonsense , although it 's mostly plausible nonsense .
Even " callochbarthe " is almost plausible .
( The unfortunate " chb " in the middle is just bad luck .
It occurs because Genesis 36 mentions Baalhanan the son of Achbor . )
The N=1 sample is recognizably bogus ; no English word looks like " ieahrn " , and the triple " l " in " alll " is nearly impossible .
( I did once write to Jesse Sheidlower , an editor of the Big Dictionary , to ask his advice about whether " ballless " should be hyphenated . )
I have prepared samples of pseudo - Finnish of various qualities .
The input here was a bunch of text I copied out of Finnish Wikipedia .
( Where else ?
If you need Finnish text in 1988 , you get it from the Usenet fi.talk group ; if you need Finnish text in 2008 , you get it from Finnish Wikipedia . )
I did a little bit of manual cleanup , as with the English , but not too much .

Before anyone objects to the non-word " ml " in the N=2 sample , let me explain that this is the standard abbreviation for " millilitra " .
The " i " in the N=3 sample was a puzzle , since Marko Heiskanen assures me that Finnish has no one - letter words .
But it appears in my sample in connection with Sukselaisen I hallitus , whatever that is , so I capitalized it .
I must say that I found " yhdysvalmistämistammonit " rather far - fetched , even in Finnish .
But then I discovered that " yhdeksänkymmenvuotiaaksi " and " yhdysvalloissakaan " are genuine , so who am I to judge ?
[ Addendum 20080601 : Some additional notes . ]

In an article in the July issue of Reason about libertarian responses to environmental issues , Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute makes this interesting point :
We believe that if we just go out and talk to everybody for a few hours they ’ll become libertarians .
That ’s not a wisely thought - through process , and it misses the whole point .
Most people are — have to be —rationally ignorant .
Our challenge is to make them understand that for their values , freedom is better than coercion .
Smith makes a point here that I think is applicable to libertarian political strategy in general .
When libertarians talk amongst ourselves , the truth of libertarian ideas is so self - evident that I think we lose sight of what it takes to win arguments in the political sphere .
The vast majority of Americans , and , in some cases , even politically aware and active libertarians , do n’t spend their days and nights thinking about how some minute point of libertarian theory applies to some even - more - minute public policy issue ( I mean , seriously , is there really a libertarian position on sanitary sewer maintenance ?
I ’m sure the anarcho - capitalists will say there is ) , and , when they walk into the voting booth , they are n’t worrying about the non-aggression principle or whether A is A .
The average American cares about their family , their job , and their pocketbook .
Often , in that order .
Politicians who succeed understand that , and , more often than not , pander to it .
Libertarian politicians who spend their time talking about monetary theory are n’t going to impress people like that much , if at all .
If libertarian ideas are going to succeed , it ’s not going to be because of some Constantine - like conversion on the part of the public , it ’s going to be because libertarian - oriented politicians have crafted a message that convinces the public of the one very simple idea :
Freedom works .
When that starts to happen , then libertarians — whether they belong to the Libertarian Party , the Republican Party , or the Democratic Party — will start to win elections .
Until then , I think , we ’re all just going to be engaging in the political equivalent of arguing over how many angels dance on the head of a pin .
The Dow Chemical Company said Tuesday that it was raising prices for the second time in a month to offset a “ relentless rise ” in energy costs , a sign that companies may increasingly have to pass on price increases to their customers .
The increase of as much as 25 percent — the largest in the company ’s history — comes after a 20 percent rise last month that the company said did not go far enough given the continuing surge in energy prices .
Dow , which makes products ranging from pesticides to plastic wraps , also said it would impose freight surcharges of $ 300 for each truck shipment and $ 600 for each rail shipment beginning Aug. 1 in the United States .
In addition , it will scale back production in plants across North America and Europe .
Andrew N. Liveris , the company ’s chairman and chief executive , said the changes were “ extremely unwelcome but entirely unavoidable ” as oil and natural gas continue to set records .
Oil prices are up more than 40 percent this year and have risen $ 9 a barrel since Dow ’s earlier price increase .
Natural gas is up more than 70 percent this year .
Libertarian
This week the Boston Tea Party began endorsing candidates who accept our smaller government platform .
Since our party is not yet on the ballot in every state , we are looking to candidates from all the other parties who are willing to agree that a smaller government at every level and on every issue , and a larger government at no level and on no issues , is best .
In other words , we are looking for men and women who accept , as Henry David Thoreau said in 1848 , that the first step toward a better government is for each of us to declare what would be a better government .
To me , and to millions of people like me , a better government has to be smaller .
We pay too much in taxes .
We pay too much for everything because of the cost of regulations .
We suffer too much from the abridgement of our freedom and the nationalisation of powers .
We suffer privation , disease , injuries and death due to the USA government ’s violations of the constitution , including the illegitimate wars on Americans called the war on drugs and the war on terror .
We see the USA government causing too much privation , disease , injury , and death all over the world in foreign wars and decades long military occupations of foreign countries like Germany , Japan , and Korea .
It is time to eliminate government programs .
It is time to fire government employees .
It is time to bring all the troops home from all the countries where they are stationed .
It is time for free trade , not managed trade .
It is time for an end to the social welfare state .
Americans currently feed , house , clothe , care for , and salary 52 % of the population in city , county , regional , state , and national government programs .
More than half the population either works for or is directly paid by some government agency at some level .
Obviously , such dubious “ largesse ” cannot continue .
It is n’t really largesse , because the money being bestowed is entirely stolen .
Taxation is theft , regulation is restraint of trade , and war is murder .
If you want a bigger government program for NASA , we do n’t want you in the Boston Tea Party .
I know all about NASA , all about the defense contractor companies who abusively perform trivial project work for shamefully high fees .
I ’ve been black listed from working in the industry since 1991 , and I still get daily e-mails from people all over the industry making me aware of corruption , mismanagement , malfeasance , and the deaths of personnel in all areas of the space program .
Clearly , having butchered two batches of seven astronauts with their negligence , NASA has no business being involved in space activities .
Equally obvious , dozens of entrepreneurs are ready and able to take up the challenge of putting people in space , if only NASA would stop ruining their lives , as they ruined mine .
If you want a bigger government program for your favorite cause , we do n’t want you in the Boston Tea Party .
My experience , going back to my earliest political writings , a “ My Turn ” piece that Newsweek magazine never published , is that everyone knows that the government is wrecking things in the area they care about .
Veterans are terrified of VA hospitals .
Farmers are disgusted by the Department of Agriculture .
Environmentalists see the EPA approving things it should n’t , banning things that are harmless , and egregiously benefiting influential business interests to the detriment of the environment .
NASA enthusiasts see NASA constantly screwing things up .
Experts on nearly any area of foreign policy you care to name see the government failing to do the right thing all over the world , and supporting one corrupt regime after another .
Yet , the interest groups clamor for more money for their interest area , in spite of their detailed knowledge of how the government is screwing up whenever it does anything in that area .
It is time to give it a rest .
It is time to admit that government was never the solution to our problems .
It is time to accept that the industrial era civilisation which organised mass production , mass destruction , total war , mass media , and massive government is a past era , a dying civilisation , and one we are well rid of .
It is time to move on to the decentralised , specialised , highly personalised information era civilisation we are capable of achieving .
We have all the tools to do things better , to make life better , to customise solutions for all kinds of problems , and to leave the mass production society so its components and factories may be recycled into something better .
Nothing better is going to come of centralisation of authority .
Nothing better is going to come of mass produced goods or mass media to control minds or weapons of mass destruction .
We ’ve seen what the Procrustean one - size - fits - all assembly line does for people , and we do n’t need it .
Nor can we afford it .
Government must become smaller , and it can either shrink voluntarily , through the efforts of peaceful persons accepting the necessity for less oversight , less regulation , fewer prohibitions , and a smaller jail population , or it will be shrunk by force .
People will resist , they will rebel , they are in a revolution right now , and the revolt is only presently non-violent .
It is not guaranteed to remain non-violent .
Indeed , the current round of overseas interventions is already violent , bloody , unjustified , and deadly .
The United States government has over - stepped the constitution , has violated the treaties to which it is a party , has engaged in war crimes in Afghanistan , in Iraq , in Somalia , and in other countries , and must be brought to heel .
The appeasement which characterised treatment of Hitler ’s anschluss in Austria and the Sudetenland , the lack of action against his invasion of Czechoslovakia , and the cataclysm which saw his occupation of Poland , Holland , Belgium , and France is identical to the way the international community has treated Bush ’s invasion of Afghanistan , occupation of Iraq , and military intervention through Ethiopian proxies in Somalia .
A war with Iran would be a cataclysm , as Iran has been at considerable effort to illustrate with its recent missile tests .
These wars must end .
Which means that libertarians must step up our campaigns , increase our efforts , and recruit more participants in an effort to rein in excessive government .
This year , this election season , now is the time .
Complacency and timidness must be shed .
Take on the the greater person you know you can be .
Take a leading role in changing society for the better , for individual liberty , for economic freedom , today .
On the other hand , if you want a smaller government at all levels and a bigger government at no level , then we are eager to have you join our party .
You may join us without leaving the other party you belong to now .
We have members of our party who are also active in the Republican party , many who have worked for Ron Paul ’s campaign .
We have members of our party who are also active in the Libertarian party , many of whom are campaigning for public office for that party .
We have members who have left those parties , and who have left other parties , because they were looking for something better .
Make no mistake about it , there is corruption in high places .
There is corruption in the Republican Party .
There is corruption in the Democratic Party .
There is an unbelievable amount of corruption in the Libertarian Party , given its small size and the paltry sums of money involved in the sleaze and filth going on .
But there is no corruption in the Boston Tea Party .
Why not ?
I can think of three reasons right off .
Openness .
Rule of the members .
Zero national budget .
The Boston Tea Party is completely open in all its activities .

and see everything we ’re doing , review the polls taken at our nominating convention in June , check it all out , even many of the logs are public .
Want access to the super secret clandestine conversations which we use in smoke filled back rooms to make all the decisions ?
Sorry to disappoint you , but all our deliberations are public .
That turns out to be important , because any time the national committee takes any action with which the members disagree , any member can initiate a poll to reconsider that action .
A majority of those members who vote in the poll determine what happens .
We ’ve already tested that feature .
Earlier this year , I was persuaded by the vice chair of the party that we should have a nominating convention in which each state affiliate cast one vote .
It seemed like a great way to get new state affiliates organised .
One of our members disagreed and started a poll to overturn that action .
All those who voted in the poll did vote against it .
So , we went back to one member one vote and held our convention in June .
When the vice chair tried to stop the poll by abusing his power over the national web site , his administrative privileges were revoked .
Ultimately , he resigned over the issue .
So , it is very difficult for us to have corruption in high places because everything we do is in the open , and everything we do is subject to being reviewed and over - ruled by the members .
In addition , corruption is very unlikely because the national party has no authority to control any significant amount of money .
We have raised and spent less than $ 76 so far this year .
Our state affiliates are authorised to raise funds , though some of them have adopted the same limitation for the same reason .
So , much of the fundraising is handled by individual campaigns , or by individual donors .
As a result of these features , the Boston Tea Party has become the fastest growing libertarian political party in America .
We are adding new members , new state affiliates , and new candidates at an increasingly rapid pace .
You can join us .
Membership is free .
All you have to do is visit our web site , read the platform , agree with it , and you ’re in .
Nothing to pay .
Nothing to send in .
No fuss , no muss .
One person , one membership .
Oh , yes , we ’ve tested that this year , too .
A nationalist socialist youth tried to form 12 memberships from an open relay in Milwaukee and cast votes during our online nominating convention .
Though he is convinced that a strong leader , or fuhrer , is needed , he opted to cast all his votes for “ none of the above ” in the polls .
We were able to detect and disable his accounts so the polling was not tainted .
Many of our members are actually quite clever where computer related technology is concerned .
If you are a candidate for public office , go to our web site and look at our platform .
If you agree with it and join , contact your state affiliate or the national committee , and we ’ll examine your campaign materials .
If we agree that you are consistently for a smaller government at all levels and on all issues , we ’ll endorse your candidacy .
We ’ve already endorsed candidates in North Carolina , Massachusetts , and New Hampshire – states where we do n’t yet have affiliate party organisations – and we ’re expecting to announce the endorsement by state affiliates of candidates in Texas , Alabama , Michigan , and elsewhere .
Perhaps most importantly , in some ways , we have chosen two standard bearers who are exceptional in the movement for individual liberty .
Charles Jay helped to organise the Personal Choice Party in 2004 and is running as our presidential candidate .
Tom Knapp has been involved in many libertarian activities , most notably the Rational Review news aggregation site , and is our vice presidential candidate .
You can learn more about Charles at CJ08.com .
The Boston Tea Party has avoided the pitfalls embraced by other parties .
We did not choose Barack Obama , who recently betrayed Americans with his vote in support of telecomm immunity and domestic espionage in favoring FISA .
We did not choose John McCain whose opposition to free speech , private property , and peace is notorious .
Nor did we choose Bob Barr , who recently extolled the supposed virtues of arch - segregationist Jesse Helms , has opposed Wiccans in the military , opposes gays and lesbians having access to the institution of marriage , announced his opposition to legalising all drugs two weeks before the LP nominating convention , voted for the USAPATRIOT act , and voted for the war in Iraq .
But , you do n’t have to support our national candidates if you do n’t wish .
Chances are , except in Colorado , Florida , and perhaps eight or ten other states , you wo n’t even have the option of voting for Jay or Knapp because they wo n’t be on the ballot in your state .
We ’re working hard to correct that difficulty , and we expect to be on 30 or 40 state ballots in time for the 2010 Congressional elections .
But you still do n’t have to feel any obligation toward party loyalty .
I know that the scoundrels in the national LP have been pushing party loyalty as hard as they can .
After all , they ’ve seen about half the members of the party fail to renew their membership since 2000 .
The stench of corruption is too much for most dedicated freedom activists .
Men like Chris Bennett and women like Angela Keaton have refused to be a part of the idiocy in the LP , and have withdrawn their cooperation – in both their cases filling out the remainder of their terms , but without the enthusiasm which has long characterised their involvement .
Party loyalty , like patriotism , is a refuge of scoundrels .
It is a way of justifying all kinds of wrong doing in the name of “ we need to do these wrong things to win . ”
I wo n’t put up with it .
So do n’t feel you have to support our candidates if you join our party .
You do n’t .
In some cases , you wo n’t be able to support their bids for public office even if you wish , due to onerous laws in your state .
You are welcome to support any presidential or vice presidential candidate you please .
But , we do think that the only candidates who are for smaller government in all areas , and a larger government in none are Charles Jay and Tom Knapp .
We are coming into some difficult times economically .
The Federal Reserve has been printing money without regard to any intrinsic value since August of 1971 , thanks to a stupid executive order by evil president Nixon .
For various reasons , they have had one of the longer runs with fiat money in world history , not quite as long as the mulberry bark paper of the Mongol Khans , much longer than the Weimar Republic ’s disastrous hyperinflation .
But the easy ride is coming to an end .
As my friend Doug Casey notes , we are headed for a Greater Depression to make the 1930s look like economic easy street in comparison .
Indeed , my view is that the only greater depression in economic history of the last 500 years is the 1722 to 1782 depression caused by the disaster of the Banque Royale and Bank of England paper money schemes .
If a sixty - year depression sounds very long , you may hope that technology speeds up the recovery , as well .
But the future beyond those economic problems looks very bright indeed .
Technology is making it possible to do more things , do them faster , live longer , live more healthy lives , and enjoy the resources not only of this planet , but of our entire Solar System .
We are approaching an era of great prosperity and great opportunity .
Most of what stands in our way is corruption , political machinations , and excessively zealous government .
Since these are entirely problems of human making , they can be , and are being , resolved with human action .
It wo n’t be easy to overcome centuries of excessive government , prohibitionism , welfare and warfare statism , and idiocy .
Some of us are going to be hurt by the effort , and some are going to die trying to get rid of the last vestiges of mass appeal government .
Worthwhile things are never cheap , they are dear .
The expense in treasure , in lives , and in sacred honor cannot be too high , though , for the blessings of peace , prosperity , and freedom we can bestow upon ourselves and our posterity .
These are revolutionary times .
Once again , it is time for women and men to stand up , don the costumes , board the ships , and dump the tea in Boston Harbor .
It is time to act up and act out .
It is time to get rowdy and be free .
It is time to show those in government that we wo n’t be tamed , we wo n’t be caged , and we wo n’t be intimidated .
They can in fact kill us , but they can never take our freedom .
Please join the Boston Tea Party today .
The freedom you save may be your own .
“ Science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated .
Science , for me , gives a partial explanation of life .
In so far as it goes , it is based on fact , experience and experiment . ”
Rosalind Franklin , in a letter to her father , summer 1940 .
In late February 1953 , Rosalind Franklin , a 33 - year - old physical chemist working in the biophysics unit of King 's College in London , wrote in her notebooks that the structure of DNA had two chains .
She had already worked out that the molecule had its phosphate groups on the outside and that DNA existed in two forms .
Two weeks later James Watson and Francis Crick , at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge , built their now celebrated model of DNA as a double helix .
They did it not only through brilliant intuition and a meeting of compatible minds , but also on the basis of Franklin 's unpublished experimental evidence , which had reached them through irregular routes .
She did not know that they had seen either her X - ray photograph ( Fig. 1 ) , showing unmistakable evidence of a helical structure , or her precise measurements of the unit cell ( the smallest repeating unit ) of the DNA crystal .
Figure 1 : “ Her photographs are among the most beautiful X - ray photographs of any substance every taken . ” — J. D. Bernal , 1958 .
Franklin's X - ray diagram of the B form of sodium thymonucleate ( DNA ) fibres , published in Nature on 25 April 1953 , shows “ in striking manner the features characteristic of helical structures ” 5 .

As Watson was to write candidly , “ Rosy , of course , did not directly give us her data .
For that matter , no one at King 's realized they were in our hands . ”
When this admission appeared in Watson 's best - selling , much - acclaimed book of the discovery , The Double Helix , published in 1968 ( ref. 1 ) , he was a Harvard professor and Nobel laureate ( he had shared the prize for medicine and physiology in 1962 , with Crick and Maurice Wilkins of King 's College . )
By then Franklin had died — in 1958 , at the age of 37 , from ovarian cancer .
Other comments dismissive of “ Rosy ” in Watson 's book caught the attention of the emerging women 's movement in the late 1960s .
“ Clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place [...]
Unfortunately Maurice could not see any decent way to give Rosy the boot ” .
And , “ Certainly a bad way to go out into the foulness of a [...]
November night was to be told by a woman to refrain from venturing an opinion about a subject for which you were not trained . ”
A feminist icon
Such flamboyantly chauvinist phrases were sufficient to launch the legend of Franklin , the wronged heroine .
So too was Watson 's insistence on judging Franklin by her appearance rather than by her performance as a scientist .
( She was , when she came to King 's from the French government laboratory where she had worked from 1947 to the end of 1950 , a recognized expert on the structure of coals , carbons and disordered crystals , with many publications to her credit . )
The Franklin myth has continued to grow , abetted by the fact of her tragically early death .
Franklin has become a feminist icon — the Sylvia Plath of molecular biology — seen as a genius whose gifts were sacrificed to the greater glory of the male .
Her failure to win the Nobel prize has been given as a prime example of the entrenched misogyny of the science establishment , rather than the consequence of the Nobel statute against posthumous awards .
Watson 's caricature of the bad - tempered “ Rosy ” drew a counter - blast from her good friend , the American writer Anne Sayre , in Rosalind Franklin and DNA , published in 1975 ( ref. 2 ) .
Sayre 's book provided a much - needed corrective portrait , but was marred by a feminist bias .
For example , it grossly underestimated the number of women scientists at King 's in the early 1950s .
Sayre maintained there was only one other than Franklin , whereas there were at least eight on the senior staff .
She insisted , moreover , that women 's exclusion from the King 's senior common room deprived Franklin of the intellectual companionship of her colleagues .
In fact , most of the scientific staff preferred to eat in the joint dining room , men and women together , and the women , in general , felt well treated at King's .
Reassessing the facts
As a biographer writing nearly three decades later and given access to Franklin 's personal correspondence , I found a more attractive , capable woman than Watson had suggested , and a King 's College more congenial and welcoming to women scientists than Sayre had allowed .
I also found that Franklin felt singularly unhappy at King 's , not so much because of her gender , but because of her class and religion : a wealthy Anglo - Jew felt out of place in a Church of England setting dominated by swirling cassocks and students studying for the priesthood .
“ At King 's , ” she wrote to Sayre ( albeit inaccurately ) , “ there are neither Jews nor foreigners ” .
She was , in fact , so unhappy at King 's that , in early 1953 , getting out as fast as possible was far more important to her than finishing her work on DNA .
How far she had advanced was reported in two articles in Nature3, 4 by Sir Aaron Klug , Franklin 's closest collaborator at Birkbeck College , London , where she moved to from King's .
He concluded that she had come very close to discovering the structure of DNA herself .
An irony of the story is that her own manuscript ( coauthored by her student , R. G. Gosling and dated 17 March 1953 ) summarizing her results was already prepared by the time news reached King 's that Watson and Crick had cracked the DNA secret .
Thus she inserted a hand - written amendment to her manuscript — which was published in Nature on 25 April 1953 ( ref. 5 ) , along with the now - celebrated Watson and Crick paper and another by Wilkins , Herbert Wilson and Alec Stokes of King 's — to say “ Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication ” .
And so they should have been , for the Watson - Crick findings were based on her data .
There is no evidence that she knew that in late January 1953 Wilkins had innocently shown her Photograph 51 , with its stark cross of black reflections ( Fig. 1 ) , to Watson , who was visiting King's .
Nor did she know that in February 1953 Max Perutz , then at the Cavendish Laboratory , had let Watson and Crick see his copy of the Medical Research Council 's report summarizing the work of all principal researchers , including Franklin's .
At the same time there is no evidence that Franklin felt bitter about their achievement or had any sense of having been outrun in a race that nobody but Watson and Crick knew was a race .
Indeed , she could accept the Watson–Crick model as a hypothesis only .
She wrote in Acta Crystallographica in September 1953 that “ discrepancies prevent us from accepting it in detail ” 6 .
Belated credit
Watson and Crick seem never to have told Franklin directly what they subsequently have said from public platforms long after her death — that they could not have discovered the double helix of DNA in the early months of 1953 without her work .
This is all the more surprising in view of the close friendship that developed among the three of them — Watson , Crick and Franklin — during the remaining years of her life .
During this time , she was far happier at non-sectarian Birkbeck than she ever was at King's , and led a spirited team of researchers studying tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) .
From 1954 until months before her death in April 1958 , she , Watson and Crick corresponded , exchanged comments on each other 's work on TMV , and had much friendly contact .
At Wood 's Hole , Massachusetts , in the summer of 1954 Watson offered Franklin a lift across the United States as he was driving to her destination , the California Institute of Technology .
In the spring of 1956 she toured in Spain with Crick and his wife Odile and subsequently stayed with them in Cambridge when recuperating from her treatments for ovarian cancer .
Characteristically , she was reticent about the nature of her illness .
Crick told a friend who asked that he thought it was “ something female ” .
In the years after leaving King's , Franklin published 17 papers , mainly on the structure of TMV ( including four in Nature ) .
She died proud of her world reputation in the research of coals , carbons and viruses .
Given her determination to avoid fanciful speculation , she would never have imagined that she would be remembered as the unsung heroine of DNA .
Nor could she have envisaged that King 's College London , where she spent the unhappiest two years of her professional career , would dedicate a building — the Franklin–Wilkins building — in honour of her and the colleague with whom she had been barely on speaking terms .

BBC News , Ramallah
Ramallah is the West Bank 's political and cultural centre
Enlarge Image
On my very first day in Ramallah , a little over a year ago , I went into a small takeaway , beside the city 's main Catholic Church .
In the best Arabic I could muster , I asked for a chicken pizza .
" Small or large ? " said the Palestinian man behind the counter , in English .
Until recently , it turned out , he 'd been living in the United States .
" I was in Chicago for seven years , " he told me , " but it was getting too dangerous , all the shooting , all the crime .
I decided it was much safer to come back home . "
Ramallah was full of surprises .
Not what I 'd expected of a conflict zone , of the occupied West Bank .
The place immediately felt modern , liberal , relatively prosperous and , above all , relaxed .
The energy of the " downtown " part of the city quickly became addictive , with its markets and cafes and noise .
On warm evenings , it 's packed with shoppers , or families on a night out - perhaps heading for a gloopy Tutti Frutti at Rukab 's Ice Cream Parlour .
Groups of young men and women hang around the main square , showing off .
And the upper social strata do their fair share of strutting and preening too , at a slew of fancy bars and restaurants across the city .
On a Thursday night , the beginning of the Ramallah weekend , my apartment invariably vibrates to the sounds of American R'n 'B and Hip - hop coming from Sinatra 's bar , down the road , catering to a mix of Muslim and Christian young people dancing and sometimes drinking .
Bloody reminder
In the past the city has , on occasion , been hit hard by the Israeli military .
It was here they laid siege to the headquarters of the then Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Once the army had gone , I was a little surprised to see grown Palestinian men standing by the side of the road , weeping and hugging
Occasionally still , the bubble does burst in this capital of Palestinian escapism .
One weekday last year , at about three in the afternoon , Israeli armoured jeeps moved into the centre of Ramallah , pulling up outside the most popular hummus cafe .
In full view of passers - by , including children on their way back from school , the troops dragged a man in his early 20s out of the cafe .
He was a wanted militant .
They shot him - first in the legs , then stomach , then his head .
Within minutes , the " Palestinian reflex " had kicked in .
Schoolboys piled into the area to throw stones at the soldiers until they left .
As we arrived , the troops fired back with live bullets , injuring four people , before the jeeps sped out of the city .
Ramallah has had its fair share of bloodshed during the intifada
Once the army had gone , I have to say , I was a little surprised to see grown Palestinian men standing by the side of the road , weeping and hugging , and teenagers who'd been throwing stones , breaking down .
But , of course blood is blood , and trauma is trauma .
But moments as dramatic as this have become rare in Ramallah .
There are frequent search and arrest operations carried out by the Israeli army overnight , but they rarely trouble most people 's sleep .
Elsewhere in the West Bank , things are very different .
Nablus and Jenin all but shut down as night falls , bracing themselves for the regular army incursions and shootouts that come their way .
The Israeli settlement right in the centre of Hebron has given that city a tense and miserable edge , and Bethlehem is becoming increasingly suffocated by the concrete of the barrier Israel continues to build - it says , to protect itself from Palestinian suicide bombers .
Under sanctions , life in the Gaza Strip has almost come to a halt - and it's there that people most seem to resent Ramallah 's attempts to block the conflict out of its mind .
Centenary fireworks
On a single day last month , in an angry Israeli reaction to the killing of three of its soldiers in earlier fighting , nearly 20 Palestinians were killed in military operations in Gaza , most of them civilians .
Arab TV channels had spent the day broadcasting the final footage of a cameraman killed by a tank shell , and pictures the bodies of five children blown apart in the shelling .
Ramallah streets witness activities seldom encountered elsewhere
That same night , Ramallah , was having a street party .
A stage was set up , with dancers , music and fireworks .
It was an event to mark the centenary of Ramallah being accorded city status - death was n't going to get in the way .
Some Palestinians suggest this city is a product of an Israeli plot , to create a place for the foreign diplomats and journalists to visit , and wonder what all the occupation fuss is about .
But , in truth , if you 're looking for it , the impact of that occupation is not too hard to find , even in Ramallah .
There are three refugee camps around the city and the Torture Rehabilitation Centre here is overwhelmed with cases of those affected by their incarceration in Israel .
Israeli settlements loom on the rolling hills outside the city , and travelling to many of the villages surrounding the city , means going through Israeli military checkpoints .
Of course , when asked , people here will tell you of the injustice they feel about the wider conflict , and of their fears that it would n't take much for worse times to return .
But they 'll also tell you they 've simply had enough of the struggling .
After so many years , the residents of Ramallah just seem to want to forget it and get on with living as best they can .
It really should n't come as a surprise .
Those in Israel who can , do the same .
And , if given the chance , so too would people living in Jenin , and Nablus and Gaza .

Randy Pausch Inspired Millions
Published : July 25 , 2008
Learn more about Randy 's story >>
Randy Pausch , the professor at Carnegie Mellon University who inspired countless students in the classroom and others worldwide through his highly acclaimed last lecture , has died of complications from pancreatic cancer .
He was 47 .
Also a Carnegie Mellon alumnus , Pausch co-founded the Entertainment Technology Center and led researchers who created Alice , a revolutionary way to teach computer programming .
He was widely respected in academic circles for a unique interdisciplinary approach , bringing together artists , dramatists and designers to break new ground by working in collaboration with computer scientists .
Outside the classroom , he gained public fame for delivering what would come to be known as " The Last Lecture . "
On Sept. 18 , 2007 , only a month after doctors told him that he had three - to - six months to live following a recurrence of pancreatic cancer , he presented a lecture called " Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams " to a packed auditorium at Carnegie Mellon .
The moving and often humorous talk recounted his efforts to achieve such childhood dreams as becoming a professional football player , experiencing zero gravity and developing Disney World attractions .
In the process , he shared his insights on finding the good in other people , working hard to overcome obstacles and living generously .
" If you lead your life the right way , the karma will take care of itself , " Pausch said .
" The dreams will come to you . "
The video appeared on countless websites and has been viewed by millions .
Appearances on the Oprah Winfrey Show , ABC's Good Morning America and the CBS Evening News followed .
A book version , " The Last Lecture " co-written by Jeff Zaslow of the Wall Street Journal ( and a fellow Carnegie Mellon alumnus ) , became a best - seller upon its release this spring .
" Randy had an enormous and lasting impact on Carnegie Mellon , " said Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon .
" A brilliant researcher and gifted teacher , he was a key member of our Human - Computer Interaction Institute and co-founder of the Entertainment Technology Center .
His love of teaching , his sense of fun and his brilliance came together in the Alice project , which teaches students computer programming while enabling them to do something fun — making animated movies and games .
Carnegie Mellon — and the world — are better places for having had Randy Pausch in them . "
Pausch was also a pioneer in the development of virtual reality , including creating the popular Building Virtual Worlds class .
A memorial service at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh is being planned ; details will be announced at a later date .
He is survived by his wife , Jai , and three children : Chloe , Dylan and Logan .
The family requests that donations on his behalf be directed to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network , 2141 Rosecrans Ave. , Suite 7000 , El Segundo , CA 90245 , or to Carnegie Mellon 's Randy Pausch Memorial Fund , which the university will use primarily to support continued work on the Alice project .

Japan has defended its practice of ' scientific ' whale hunting at the annual International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting in Chile , insisting it had yielded important scientific results .
Officials from Japan , which is pressing for the ban on commercial whaling to be lifted , said during the third day of the meeting in Santiago that their research has shown that whales are healthy and abundant in the Antarctic .
Researchers at Japan 's Institute of Cetacean Research say they have discovered interesting information on the sexual maturation of whale species which they said could not have been obtained in any other way .
They added that since the moratorium on commercial whale - hunting came into force in 1986 , many whale species populations have increased .
Countries that oppose whale hunting , such as Australia , the United States and many in the European Union and Latin America , have urged Japan to reconsider its program , arguing that research is possible without killing whales .
Some observers believe Japan 's decision to present its findings to the IWC could open the door to ending the practice .
" What Japan has accepted is ... for the first time to put up the scientific hunting up for discussion at the IWC , " Chilean delegate Cristian Maquieira said .
But the spokesman of the Japanese delegation , Glenn Inwood , rejected this outright , saying that according to IWC rules , scientific research " is managed by the countries by themselves , so it does not have to be reviewed by the IWC . "
According to the IWC , Japan , which has a fishing quota of 1,000 , hunted 551 Minke whales in the Antarctic and 158 in the north Pacific Ocean in 2007 - 08 , as well as another 150 other species in the same ocean .
The Japanese delegation complained of an active campaign of harassement by environmental organisations against its research ships .
The Greenpeace ICW delegate , Milko Schvartzman , said the campaign group 's ship , the Esperenza , has stepped in several times at the last minute to save whales from Japanese boats , preventing 300 from being killed last season .

Once again it is time to bid aloha to that sober team of mirthless entertainers , Petraeus & Crocker .
It ’s hard to imagine where you could find another pair of such sleep - inducing performers .
I ca n’t look at Petraeus — his uniform ornamented like a Christmas tree with honors , medals and ribbons — without thinking of the great Mort Sahl at the peak of his brilliance .
He talked about meeting General Westmoreland in the Vietnam days .
Mort , in a virtuoso display of his uncanny detailed knowledge — and memory — of such things , recited the lengthy list ( “ Distinguished Service Medal , Croix de Guerre with Chevron , Bronze Star , Pacific Campaign ” and on and on ) , naming each of the half - acre of decorations , medals , ornaments , campaign ribbons and other fripperies festooning the general ’s sternum in gaudy display .
Finishing the detailed list , Mort observed , “ Very impressive ! ” Adding , “ If you ’re twelve . ”
( As speakers , both Petraeus and Crocker are guilty of unbearable sesquipedalianism , a word wickedly inflicted on me by my English - teaching mother .
It ’s one of those words that is what it says .
From the Latin , literally “ using foot - and - a - half - long words . ”
We all learned the word for words that sound like what they say — like “ click ” or “ pop ” or “ boom ” or “ hiss ” — but I ’m sure the mercifully defunct Famous Writers School surely forbade using the “ sesqui ” word and “ onomatopoeia ” in the same paragraph .
( You can have fun with both of them at your next cocktail party . )
But back to our story .
Never in this breathing world have I seen a person clog up and erode his speaking — as distinct from his reading — with more “ uhs , ” “ ers ” and “ ums ” than poor Crocker .
Surely he has never seen himself talking : “ Uh , that is uh , a , uh , matter that we , er , um , uh are carefully , uh , considering . ”
( Not a parody , an actual Crocker sentence .
And not even the worst . )
These harsh - on - the - ear insertions , delivered in his less than melodious , hoarse - sounding tenor , are maddening .
And their effect is to say that the speaker is painfully unsure of what he wants , er , um , to say .
If Crocker ’s collection of these broken shards of verbal crockery were eliminated from his testimony , everyone there would get home at least an hour earlier .
Petraeus commits a different assault on the listener .
And on the language .
In addition to his own pedantic delivery , there is his turgid vocabulary .
It reminds you of Copspeak , a language spoken nowhere on earth except by cops and firemen when talking to “ Eyewitness News . ”
Its rule : never use a short word where a longer one will do .
It must be meant to convey some misguided sense of “ learnedness ” and “ scholasticism ” — possibly even that dread thing , “ intellectualism ” — to their talk .
Sorry , I mean their “ articulation . ”
No crook ever gets out of the car .
A “ perpetrator exits the vehicle . ”
( Does any cop say to his wife at dinner , “ Honey , I stubbed my toe today as I exited our vehicle ” ? )
No “ man ” or “ woman ” is present in Copspeak .
They are replaced by that five - syllable , leaden ingot , the “ individual . ”
The other day , there issued from a fire chief ’s mouth , “ It contributed to the obfuscation of what eventually eventuated . ”
This from a guy who looked like he talked , in real life , like Rocky Balboa .
And there ’s nothing wrong with that .
Who imposes this phony , academic - sounding verbal junk on brave and hard - working men and women who do n’t need the added burden of trying to talk like effete characters from Victorian novels ?
And , General , there is no excuse anywhere on earth for a stillborn monster like “ ethnosectarian conflict , ” as Jon Stewart so hilariously pointed out .
What would the general be forced to say if it were n’t for the icky , precious - sounding “ challenge ” that he leans so heavily on ?
That politically correct term , which was created so that folks who are legally blind , deaf , clumsy , crippled , impotent , tremor - ridden , stupid , addicted or villainously ugly are really none of those unhappy things at all .
They are merely challenged .
( Are these euphemisms supposed to make them feel better ? )
And no one need be unlucky enough to be dead or hideously wounded anymore .
Those unfortunates are merely “ casualties ” — a sort of restful - sounding word .
( I have a friend who would like the opportunity to say to our distinguished warrior , “ General Petraeus , my son was killed in one of your challenges . ” )
Petraeus uses “ challenge ” for a rich variety of things .
It covers ominous developments , threats , defeats on the battlefield and unfound solutions to ghastly happenings .
And of course there ’s that biggest of challenges , that slapstick band of silent - movie comics called , flatteringly , the Iraqi “ fighting forces . ”
( A perilous one letter away from “ fighting farces . ” )
The ones who are supposed to allow us to bring troops home but never do .
Petraeus ’s verbal road is full of all kinds of bumps and lurches and awkward oddities .
How about “ ongoing processes of substantial increases in personnel ” ?
Try talking English , General .
You mean more soldiers .
It ’s like listening to someone speaking a language you only partly know .
And who ’s being paid by the syllable .
You miss a lot .
I guess a guy bearing up under such a chestload of hardware — and pretty ribbons in a variety of decorator colors — ca n’t be expected to speak like ordinary mortals , for example you and me .
He should try once saying — instead of “ ongoing process of high level engagements ” — maybe something in colloquial English ?
Like : “ fights ” or “ meetings ” ( or whatever the hell it ’s supposed to mean ) .
I find it painful to watch this team of two straight men , straining on the potty of language .
Only to deliver such . . . what ?
Such knobbed and lumpy artifacts of superfluous verbiage ?
( Sorry , now I ’m doing it … )
But I must hand it to his generalship .
He did say something quite clearly and admirably and I am grateful for his frankness .
He told us that our gains are largely imaginary : that our alleged “ progress ” is “ fragile and reversible . ”
( Quite an accomplishment in our sixth year of war . )
This provides , of course , a bit of pre-emptive covering of the general ’s hindquarters next time that , true to Murphy ’s Law , things turn sour again .
Back to poor Crocker .
His brows are knitted .
And he has a perpetually alarmed expression , as if , perhaps , he feels something crawling up his leg .
Could it be he is being overtaken by the thought that an honorable career has been besmirched by his obediently doing the dirty work of the tinpot Genghis Khan of Crawford , Texas ?
The one whose foolish military misadventure seems to increasingly resemble that of Gen. George Armstrong Custer at Little Bighorn ?
Not an apt comparison , I admit .
Custer sent only 258 soldiers to their deaths .
Though as The Times ’s Robin Toner writes today , the southern United States has “ become one of the biggest and reddest of the Republican strongholds , ” Senator Barack Obama ’s campaign is hoping to change that this November .
The campaign is putting resources into several southern states , running ads and signing up voters :
Steve Hildebrand , the deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama , said he saw “ tremendous potential ” in several Southern states .
“ If you go in and look at the number of unregistered voters in demographic groups that are important to Barack ’s candidacy — younger voters , African - American voters — the potential is just incredible , ” Mr. Hildebrand said .
Registering black voters will be important to any kind of “ Southern Strategy ” for the Democrats and the Wall Street Journal ’s Christopher Cooper and Susan Davis looks at the Obama campaign ’s efforts to sign them up .
Both Mr. Obama and his Republican challenger Senator John McCain sought to appeal to Hispanic voters over the weekend .
But Time Magazine ’s Michael Scherer reports that many in the Hispanic community detect a “ mixed message ” when it comes to Mr. McCain ’s stance on immigration issues :
For months , that confusion has been somewhat intentional on the part of the McCain campaign .
It was the issue of immigration , after all , that almost sunk McCain ’s candidacy back in the summer of 2007 , when the Senate debated and defeated a comprehensive immigration bill that was dubbed the McCain - Kennedy bill and derided as an “ amnesty bill ” by opponents .
After the defeat , McCain ’s public rhetoric on the issue changed significantly , even as his actual position only altered slightly .
“ I got the message , ” he told Republican crowds hundreds of times in the early voting states .
“ We will secure the borders first . ”
But in public comments , McCain often delivered a somewhat mixed message of his own .
He continued to favor all the parts of his comprehensive plan — border security , increased employer sanctions for illegal hiring and a path to citizenship for the undocumented — but he mostly refrained from using the word “ comprehensive . ”
Instead , he spoke of a two - stage solution .
First , he would secure the borders , a process that would be certified by border state governors .
Then he would push for a process to allow the 12 million undocumented immigrants to become full citizens .
The fine line Mr. McCain is walking on the immigration issue may be an indication of the importance he places on keeping both Hispanics , a fast - growing demographic , and his party ’s base happy .
Over the weekend Mr. McCain also looked to court evangelical Christian voters with a visit to the North Carolina home of the Rev. Franklin Graham and his father , Billy .
The Times ’s Robert D. McFadden writes : “ Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , had requested the meeting with the Grahams .
He called his hosts “ great leaders ” and said they had had “ an excellent conversation . ”
In response to a reporter ’s question , he said , as if slightly surprised : “ Oh , I did n’t ask for their vote . ”
Both candidates appear to be trying to burnish their foreign policy credentials .
Mr. Obama has announced plans to take an overseas trip to Iraq and Afghantian and Europe this summer .
Senator McCain heads to Latin America later this week .
The Wall Street Journal ’s Laura Meckler previews : “ In Colombia on Tuesday and Wednesday , in the coastal city of Cartagena , he plans to highlight a pending free - trade agreement that he supports and rival Sen. Barack Obama opposes .
Thursday in Mexico , the Republican candidate will talk about the war on drugs .
The Arizona senator will meet with both nations ’ presidents . ”
And The Washington Post ’s Michael D. Shear takes a closer look at what could become a familiar refrain from Republicans on the campaign trail .
He reports that they are trying to cast Mr. Obama “ as an opportunistic and self - obsessed politician who will do and say anything to get elected . ”
Veepstakes : The Los Angeles Times ’s Doyle McManus examines the long , long lists of potential running mates for both candidates , but notes : “ The real question is who ’s on the “ short lists . ”
And that remains , for the moment , Washington ’s deepest mystery . ”
Mr. McManus runs through some of the boldfaced names of vice presidential contenders .
Spouse Watch : USA Today ’s Jill Lawrence interviews Michelle Obama who is “ filling in her schedule with events that underscore her roles as girlfriend and working mom . ”
Ms. Lawrence observes : “ The result , by accident or design , is that Obama ’s softer side is on display when she needs it to be : after a winter of edgy remarks that made her a lightning rod and gave ammunition to Republican John McCain and his allies . ”

I was in a supermarket recently searching for a brown mustard - and - conditioner in one .
It was while I was reading the ingredient label on a jar of Gouldens Dry Scalp Formula that I looked to the children 's book rack and there spied the title " My Little Golden Book About God . "
Now as anyone knows , my interest in life 's headiest metaphysical mystery has led me on some strange journeys ; from the highest mountain peaks of Peru to snort crystalized alpaca urine with an Incan shaman to the sewers beneath Istanbul to read 900 - year old grafitti scrawled by the heretical Saint Phoqallyall .
Having found no theological resolution in these rarified encounters I have left the door open to the chance that sublime truth may be found where I least expect it .
So it was with genuine anticipation that I opened the book , curious to know what the people at Little Golden Books believed small children who stick Beeferoni up their noses could absorb about the Inscrutible One .
You cannot imagine my horror , however , when my eyes met pages filled with saccharine , pastel artwork depicting cold - eyed androids that were clearly not of our realm .
In a Beautiful Mind moment of schizophrenic clarity I saw the book for what it was : not a gentle introduction to life 's most profound curiosity , but a primer for the parasitic offspring of an invisible invasion !
For the safety of our race ( if any still remain ) I have translated this book in the hopes that a resistance may arise .
