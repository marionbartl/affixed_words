Despite what their PE teachers might have told them , for many of those who competed in a Chinese marathon earlier this month , it was not the taking part but the winning that counted .
Almost a third of the runners who finished in the top 100 have since been disqualified for cheating in the race in the southern port city of Xiamen .
Some of them hired imposters to compete in their place .
Some competitors jumped into vehicles part way through the route , Chinese media reported , while others gave their time - recording microchips to faster runners .
Numbers 8,892 and 8,897 both recorded good times - but only thanks to number 8,900 , who carried their sensors across the finish line .
Jiefang Daily , the Shanghai Communist party newspaper , said organisers caught the cheats when they scanned video footage .
The paper said most of those involved had apologised , but that those showing an " unco-operative attitude " would be prevented them from competing in future events .
There was more than just prestige at stake in the marathon .
Competitors stood to gain a crucial advantage in China 's highly competitive university entrance exams .
Those who finished in under two hours and 34 minutes could add extra points to their score in the gaokao , helping to explain why several of those disqualified came from a middle school in Shandong province .
The exams are so crucial to the future of Chinese children that both students and their families will go to extraordinary lengths to guarantee success .
Last year , eight parents and teachers were jailed on state secret charges after using communication devices - including scanners and wireless earpieces - to help pupils cheat .
Organisers of the international event in Xiamen have vowed to increase surveillance in future , saying that they had only 200 monitors to oversee 50,000 runners in the marathon and accompanying races .
The problem is not a new one ; in 2007 , 19 competitors in Beijing were caught with multiple timing sensors .
Nor is such cheating restricted to China .
Rosie Ruiz remains infamous in the United States for her victory in the women 's race in Boston in 1980 .
No one could understand how an unknown amateur runner had triumphed - until it emerged that she had ridden the subway almost all the way , joining the route barely a mile before the finish line .
The temptation to cheat in such a long race seems to have existed almost since the introduction of the modern marathon in the late nineteenth century .
Fred Lorz easily claimed the men's title in the 1904 St Louis Olympics with a time of three hours , 13 minutes .
Officials soon discovered the secret of his success : the 11 - mile ride he received in his manager 's car .
when doing the right thing could backfire …
A new study links autism to genetic defects passed on by older parents rather than environmental factors .
If you ’ve been watching the news , you might be aware of a recent study that found something a bit odd in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco , CA .
Children born primarily to educated and well off parents in a few suburban areas of these cities are over 70 % more likely to be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder than elsewhere in the state according to a review of some 2.4 million birth and medical records .
Now that ’s a little odd , would n’t you say ?
There are several hypothetical explanations , including a purely diagnostic one by the study ’s authors and environmental triggers are n’t being ruled out , but there ’s no smoking gun that points to any certain cause .
Or is there ?
An independent study could provide a nudge towards a possible answer .
Think about this for a moment .
We have parents of autistic children who are highly educated and well off .
Just as the researchers who found the affected clusters suggest , they would be very likely to notice the signs early on and take their children to a specialist .
Considering that autism spectrum disorders are loosely defined and notoriously hard to pin down , there ’s a huge potential for over - diagnosing them , something that was pointed out by several doctors trying to work out why there ’s been such a sharp increase in autism diagnoses over the last decade .
The tricky issue of identifying cases of autism combined with concerned parents who will ask for doctors ’ opinions should their children miss a certain developmental milestone could account for some of the elevated diagnoses .
This is the diagnostic hypothesis by the authors of the study .
However , it admittedly falls far short of explaining the sky high numbers of diagnosed cases .
But there ’s another thing that highly educated parents of autistic children seem to share and that ’s their age at pregnancy .
Advanced degrees take time to complete and their well off recipients tend to postpone having kids until they stabilize financially and establish their careers .
That ’s when nature might just have a sadistic laugh at their smart and cautious planning in the same way we would imagine a villain cackling before pressing the big red doomsday button , and increases their risk of having children with autism spectrum disorders .
In fact , one review of CDC statistics from populations in California shows that a ten year delay in motherhood can be linked to a disconcerting 38 % increase in the odds of having an autistic child .
Fathers did n’t fare much better .
The same ten year delay for men gives a 22 % increase in the odds of fathering an autistic child .
How exactly the process works is going to be require further study , but since we know that older parents can pass on more genetic defects to their children , this could be a plausible explanation for what ’s going on with rates of autism among well educated and affluent populations .
While putting off parenthood can be a wise idea in today ’s world , our bodies did n’t evolve to do what ’s fiscally responsible in a post Industrial Revolution world in which people are routinely living into their 70s and having kids into their mid-30s and beyond .
So if autism is somehow triggered by genetic problems in the germ cells of older parents , we would expect a rise in its incidence as the average age to start a family creeps upwards thanks to better food , medicine and our work patterns .
Of course at this point , this is ongoing research and it will take a while and a lot of studies to tell whether this is really what ’s happening .

On the wall across from Tucker Johnson ’s easy chair is a three - paneled drawing he believes was an early clue to his son ’s mental illness , an exacting sketch of the Pillsbury Doughboy , first intact , then split in two , then unrecognizable .
Parks , as his family calls him , was a senior at Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego when he drew it .
When his father asked him what it meant , he said , “ That ’s how I feel . ”
Tucker Parks Johnson Jr. was 24 when doctors diagnosed him with bipolar disorder , a condition marked by wild mood swings .
By then , he had walked out on his parents ’ deck and announced he was going to jump .
He did n’t intend to kill himself -- he thought he could fly .
But the low point of his troubled life was n’t the year he learned he had a mood disorder , inherited from his mother ; doctors found the right combination of antipsychotic drugs to keep him sane .
The low point came six years later , when the health insurance industry refused to cover him anymore because he was too sick .
Ever since , every day is a struggle to get along without doctors , to find his medications at the cheapest possible price .
He has n’t seen a psychiatrist in four years , or a dentist in seven .
He has nightmares that his teeth are falling out .
Now , Parks Johnson ’s best hope is in the hands of Congress .
As the Senate prepares to vote on its version of a reform bill , ideas like the “ public option ” and Medicare expansion are dead .
But no one is talking about dropping the kinds of insurance reforms that will open a new chapter in the lives of sick people like him : those with mental illness , heart disease , cancer , diabetes -- chronic ailments that touch almost every family in America .
Those patients are the ones most likely to lose coverage because their policies impose lifetime limits , or because they have , in industry parlance , a “ preexisting condition . ”
Their pain may continue , their premiums may be high , their diseases could remain incurable , but the legislation President Obama is expected to sign into law next year will almost certainly ensure they have access to health insurance .
“ With my situation that ’s the best news I could imagine .
Health insurance would free me up to go to school , to work .
Without it , it ’s just too hard , ” Johnson said .
Now 34 , he is caught in a predicament that pervades the U.S. healthcare system and helped spur the clamor for reform :
Those who need coverage the most have the hardest time getting it .
With no affordable care , Johnson ’s health deteriorated and he could n’t work .
Because he could n’t work , he could n’t get health insurance .
The result : a state - sponsored mental health facility treats his mind for $ 15 a visit , but not the rest of him .
His foot drops from nerve atrophy in his back and he falls down often , giving some the impression he ’s drunk .
His last bipolar breakdown came two years ago .
All things considered , “ it was n’t a bad one , ” his father said .
“ He was only in jail for three days . ”
Parks Johnson lives in the Mississippi Delta , cooking and caring for his grandfather for $ 200 a week .
His bedroom is the one his mother had growing up .
His greatest fear is getting sick .
To control his weight , he walks daily with his grandfather ’s chocolate lab , Dolly , lifting his right foot and setting it down in an awkward gait .
“ It ’s really scary .
What if something happens with my back with no insurance ?
We ’ve got all kinds of collection people sending bills for thousands of dollars now , ” Johnson said , having just finished making his grandfather ’s lunch .
Back in high school , Johnson ’s future looked bright .
His oil paintings and sketches were superb .
He made the golf team and the honor society .
When he won a scholarship to study architecture at Mississippi State , the local paper wrote it up .
But the fast pace of college proved too much .
A year later , at 19 , he was back home with his parents .
Four years after that , he was out on the deck , convinced he could fly .
His father recognized signs of the same disease that had afflicted his wife years before and knew his son was bipolar before the doctors announced it .
With the right medication and regular sessions with a psychiatrist , Barbara Johnson was living a full and happy life .
After a period of adjustment , it looked as though her son could too .
Soon he was back to work driving a warehouse forklift , covered by Kaiser health insurance .
When his godfather offered to teach him the scrap metal business in Atlanta , with Blue Cross coverage , Johnson leaped at the chance to live an independent life :
At 28 , he got his first apartment .
It did not last long .
The treatment that kept his mind healthy made his body a wreck :
The drugs caused weight gain -- at 5 - foot - 9 , he ballooned to 290 pounds .
He stopped taking the medicine , stopped showing up for work and got fired .
His Blue Cross insurance continued through COBRA , a federal program that temporarily extends coverage after a job loss .
His parents paid the $ 280 monthly premium .
He eventually found a job with health insurance at a furniture warehouse .
But before the benefits kicked in , his back gave out -- he jumped to catch a roll of duct tape and pins and needles shot through his legs .
An MRI showed a severe narrowing of his spine , aggravated by the added weight .
He quit before the first week was up , moved home with his parents and underwent surgery .
That ’s when , at 30 , Johnson was told , “ Enough . ” Blue Cross Blue Shield informed him he had hit his lifetime cap .
His father ’s premium check was returned .
The bills stacked up .
When one person loses insurance , it usually becomes a family affair .
Tucker and Barbara Johnson built their life around helping their son .
They rent a modest town home in Fairfax City , a Washington suburb , on an annual income of $ 100,000 -- he ’s a surgical technician , she manages a Navy exchange not far from the Pentagon .
To help pay their son ’s bills , they sold their house to tap the $ 70,000 profit ; they cleaned out a $ 52,000 retirement account and racked up $ 47,000 in credit card debt .
To rescue him from a breakdown , they dropped everything and drove 16 hours to Greenwood , Miss .
“ He ’s our son , ” Johnson ’s father said .
“ What are we going to do , let him wander the streets and not take his medicine ?
We could n’t let that happen . ”
Recovered from surgery and desperate for health insurance , Johnson took a job working with an electrician in northern Virginia who promised to pay if he found a plan .
He applied to Kaiser , which had insured him before , and was rejected for preexisting health conditions .
Several other companies said the same .
Johnson had hit a wall that affects an estimated 46 million people in America who are without health insurance .
In his case , no insurance company would take him because he was already sick , even though his father and his boss were willing to buy him a policy .
The law protects people with preexisting conditions if they are covered by group plans provided by their employers -- people like Johnson ’s mother .
But there are no such protections for those looking to buy individual coverage .
More than a third are denied , according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Kaiser explains its policy just as the overall insurance industry has : Coverage of the sickest patients -- the most expensive -- is only affordable if younger , healthier people are required to participate in the system to spread out the cost .
“ The fact that it ’s necessary to exclude anyone from coverage to keep it affordable for others is a key flaw of the current system , ” said Kaiser spokesman Won S. Ha .
“ What we support is national health reform that requires insurers to cover everyone , so long as all Americans are required to have coverage . ”
The legislation working its way through Congress would make it mandatory for most people to buy insurance , and would impose financial penalties if they do not .
The bill also provides subsidies to people of modest means to help make insurance more affordable .
Uninsured , Johnson kept working for the electrical firm .
He quit going to doctors and stopped taking his medications , but was so happy in his new jobit did n’t seem to matter .
Then he got laid off .
Out of options , in fragile health , he moved to Mississippi to take care of his ailing grandfather and got along all right until his grandfather took a fall .
Their relationship was thrown into turmoil by the strain of one sick person caring for another .
“ I just lost it , ” Johnson said .
Next thing he knew he was in his truck on the backcountry roads where his dad grew up .
“ I was not all there , but I was driving .
It ’s just a weird state of being , ” he said .
He had thrown his shirt and right shoe out the window .
His mother ’s voice on the phone snapped him out of it .
She raced to Mississippi and found him in a holding unit of the local hospital , talking to spaceships .
“ I felt guilty .
I gave this to him , ” Barbara Johnson said , holding a piece of her son ’s art , her favorite , a lioness etched in black wax , with fur so real it looks wet .
The Johnson family does n’t like to think about what comes next .
“ He ca n’t go on like this forever .
His grandfather is 86 .
If he should die , then where is Parks going ? ” the elder Johnson said , holding on to hope that Obama will sign a new healthcare bill into law soon .
That seems more and more likely , but uncertainties remain .
Once the bill is passed by the Senate as expected on Christmas Eve , House and Senate negotiators could spend weeks ironing out differences between their respective versions .
Among the many issues to be decided is how quickly each of the insurance reforms would take effect -- some could be remedied immediately , others could take years .
For Parks Johnson , the clock ticks .
He just hopes he does n’t get sick before help arrives ; he worries about burdening his parents .
“ I ’m ashamed that they had to go through all that .
I ’ve been a handful .
I do n’t want to lay around and do nothing , ” he said , while his grandfather took a midday nap , the TV blaring in the background .

The science behind the explosive pentaerythritol trinitrate , used on Northwest Airlines flight 253 and by the ' shoe bomber '
The explosive that nearly brought down Northwest Airlines flight 253 is extremely powerful , allowing terrorists to use only small quantities to cause enormous damage .
And the colourless crystals of the substance , PETN or pentaerythritol trinitrate , are hard to detect if carried in a sealed container .
Richard Reid , the " shoe bomber " , tried to set off a PETN device – on an American Airlines jet to Miami in 2001 – and this summer a man tried to assassinate a member of the Saudi royal family after evading security detectors by hiding a PETN - based bomb inside his body .
" If you can lay your hands on a reliable source , it would be the explosive of choice , " said Hans Michels , an explosives expert at Imperial College , London .
A little more than 100g of PETN could destroy a car .
The device allegedly used by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab involved a syringe and a soft plastic container filled , reportedly , with 80g of PETN .
The remnants of the bomb are being analysed in an FBI laboratory .
PETN is relatively stable and is detonated either by heat or a shockwave .
It is possible that the suspect used a syringe that was converted into an electrical detonator , but more likely the syringe was filled with nitroglycerin .
Abdulmutallab was in a window seat , 19A , and allegedly had the device strapped to his left leg , against the body of the plane .
The idea was almost certainly to blow a hole at much higher altitude , so that the decompression would tear the aircraft apart .
" There was almost certainly a failure between the primary and the main charge that meant the PETN did not fully detonate .
If it had , the plane might have limped home because it was already quite low , " Michels said .
If the syringe used a liquid detonator , such as nitroglycerin , the device would have been extremely hard to detect through the usual airport security measures .
Abdulmutallab cleared security in Lagos and Amsterdam after passing through a metal detector and having had x-rays of his hand - luggage .
Michels said that even more advanced security measures , such as machines that " sniff " passengers for explosives or analyse swabs of their clothes and belongings , might not have spotted the device .
CALGARY , Alberta , Jan 15 ( Reuters ) - Alberta ’s new energy minister will not use legislation or regulation to control the pace of development in the Canadian province ’s oil sands , his spokesman said on Friday .
Earlier , in a newspaper interview , Energy Minister Ron Liepert mused about moving away from a policy that encouraged all oil sands projects to move forward .
He clarified those remarks at a swearing - in ceremony , spokesman Jerry Bellikka said .
“ We want to make sure we ’ve got our ducks in a row , we ’ve got our planning done , we ’ve got our infrastructure in place , our labor force is there and we ’re actually ready next time , ” Bellikka said .
“ He made it very clear we ’re not talking about any interventionist policies to physically try and slow down industry ’s growth . ”

Well , the GOP dooes not like Steele dabbling in policy , since he continues to put his foot in his mouth , now the ultimatum .
Stick with state issues , get out of POLICY .
GOP leaders , in a private meeting last month , delivered a blunt and at times heated message to RNC Chairman Michael Steele : quit meddling in policy .
The plea was made during what was supposed to be a routine discussion about polling matters and other priorities in House Minority Leader John Boehner ’s office .
But the session devolved into a heated discussion about the roles of congressional leadership and Steele , according to multiple people familiar with the meeting .
The congressional leaders were particularly miffed that Steele had in late August unveiled a seniors ’ “ health care bill of rights ” without consulting with them .
The statement of health care principles , outlined in a Washington Post op - ed , began with a robust defense of Medicare that puzzled some in a party not known for its attachment to entitlements .
Elected Republicans urged Steele to focus on the governors ’ races in New Jersey and Virginia and other political matters , such as fundraising , rather than on attempting to establish party policy .
Steele was taken aback by the comments from Boehner , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) , Senate GOP conference Chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Senate GOP policy Chairman John Thune of South Dakota and grew defensive during the 10 - minute discussion , according to two people in the room .
Well , the GOP jumped on having a " black figure head " or minority if you wish and they ended up with one who continues to gaffe , not stay on their pages and does what he wants .
Now the GOP attempt to reel him in , but I know they would prefer to have someone else in Steele 's position , but when you play the " race card " as the RNC did , they have no choice but to DEAL WITH HIM .

No , not really .
But when I was a freshman in college in 1975 , the Poli Sci 101 course that I took was Straussian and neo-conservative to its core .
Kenyon College 's political science department was ( and still is–or at least it was three years ago , as this story in the far right wing journal Human Events confirms ) an " oasis " of Straussian and conservative theory .
The first text we read , as I recall , was Socrates " Apology . "
Most of us assumed that Socrates ' persecutors were the bad guys , that freedom of thought was strictly good and the suppression of free speech categorically bad .
But using Socrates ' own mode of questioning , our teachers challenged our blandly liberal presuppositions .
Precisely what 's good about Democracy ?
Why should n't the state protect itself ?
Are we sure we understand what the Founders of our own country really meant when they wrote about " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ? "
Writing in David Horowitz 's rightwing Front Page magazine in 2002 , Robert Locke explains :
The key Straussian concept is the Straussian text , which is a piece of philosophical writing that is deliberately written so that the average reader will understand it as saying one ( " exoteric " ) thing but the special few for whom it is intended will grasp its real ( " esoteric " ) meaning .
The reason for this is that philosophy is dangerous .
Philosophy calls into question the conventional morality upon which civil order in society depends ; it also reveals ugly truths that weaken men's attachment to their societies ….
Strauss shockingly admits , contrary to generations of liberal professors who have taught him as a martyr to the First Amendment , that the prosecution of Socrates was not entirely without point .
This honesty about the dangers of philosophy gives Straussian thought a seriousness lacking in much contemporary philosophy ; it is also a sign of the conviction that philosophy , contrary to the mythology of our " practical " ( though sodden with ideology and quick to take offense at ideas ) age , matters .
This is n't the inherent slipperiness of language that we 're talking about , Strauss 's is n't the radically deconstructive spirit of Barthes , Derridas , or Paul de Man .
Strauss believed , rather , that the authors had deliberately coded their texts ; applying sufficient care and scholarship , they could be decoded too .
We spent an entire semester working through Allen Bloom 's copiously annotated translation of Plato 's Republic , for example , which had a surprise on nearly every page .
Though Strauss was an atheist , he was culturally Jewish to the core .
And hermeneutics is a prototypically Jewish practice .
Kabbalists acknowledge that every Biblical text has four distinct levels of meaning :
Pashat ( simple ) , its literal surface Remez ( hints ) , suggestions ( mostly through paradoxes and double - meanings ) that something lies deeper Drash ( search ) , allegorical , symbolic , or analogic interpretations Sod ( hidden ) , its deepest , most mystical level of meaning
The Masons borrowed the idea of exoteric and esoteric texts from Kabbalah ; needless to say , Conspiracy Theorists are as suspicious of Masons as they are of Jews .
But they have armed themselves with their enemies ' methods and learned to be attentive for hidden messages and meanings themselves –thus , this anonymous poster on a conspiracist website : " Has anyone else noticed that Obama keeps saying , ' Out of many , we are one ? '
It 's the E Pluribus Unum from the seal of the US .
Is this his ritualistic mantra signaling to the world that HE will bring about the NWO ? "
A number of leading conservatives in Washington turn out to be Straussians–Locke 's piece identifies some of the most prominent circa 2002 : " Justice Clarence Thomas ; Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork ; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz ; former Assistant Secretary of State Alan Keyes ; former Secretary of Education William Bennett ; Weekly Standard editor and former Quayle Chief of Staff William Kristol ; Allan Bloom , author of THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND ; former New York Post editorials editor John Podhoretz ; former National Endowment for the Humanities Deputy Chairman John T. Agresto ; and , not meaning to class myself with this august company but in the interests of full disclosure , myself . "
Some of the architects and most strident apologists of the Iraq war turned out to be students ( or students of students , or protégés of students ) of Leo Strauss , among them Wolfowitz , Abram Shulsky , Richard Perle , Elliott Abrams , Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Douglas Feith , and Robert Kagan .
Some of them ( not all of them , but enough that it was noticeable ) were Jewish .
Leftists rightfully attacked these neo-conservatives for the disastrous consequences of their militarism , but at times there was an unsettling undertone to their rhetoric .
" The anti-Semitism behind the current wave of Strauss hatred , like the anti-Semitism that drives so much talk about the neoconservative " cabal " in Washington , is barely even veiled , " Adam Kirsch complained in the New York Sun .
" Tim Robbins , in his recent play " Embedded , " portrays characters based on Messrs .
Wolfowitz and Perle shouting " Hail Leo Strauss , " in an echo of the Nazi salute . "
Extreme rightists were even less circumspect .
But how could they not be ?
I mean , the whole phenomenon was an antisemite 's dream .
Here was a real - life , flesh - and - blood cabal of influential Jews , academically trained in the art of dissimulation and coded discourse , enacting what seemed to be a well - thought - out , long - held plan to hijack American foreign policy .
It could have been ripped right out of the pages of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion :
The art of directing masses and individuals by means of cleverly manipulated theory and verbiage , by regulations of life in common and all sorts of other quirks , in all which the GOYIM understand nothing , belongs likewise to the specialists of our administrative brain .
Reared on analysis , observation , on delicacies of fine calculation , in this species of skill we have no rivals , any more than we have either in the drawing up of plans of political actions and solidarity .
In this respect the Jesuits alone might have compared with us , but we have contrived to discredit them in the eyes of the unthinking mob as an overt organization , while we ourselves all the while have kept our secret organization in the shade .
I never drank the Straussian Kool Aid , but it was offered to me , and by teachers that I respected .
Maybe that 's why I 'm troubled by some of the kneejerk denunciations of Strauss .
Writing in Free Inquiry , Shadia Drury declared that ,
Strauss thought that the best way for ordinary human beings to raise themselves above the beasts is to be utterly devoted to their nation and willing to sacrifice their lives for it .
He recommended a rabid nationalism and a militant society modelled on Sparta .
He thought that this was the best hope for a nation to be secure against her external enemies as well as the internal threat of decadence , sloth , and pleasure .
A policy of perpetual war against a threatening enemy is the best way to ward off political decay .
And if the enemy cannot be found , then it must be invented .
Is that a fair summary of Strauss or a caricature of his disciples ?
I can't answer the question with any authority –I 'm not deeply read in Strauss , as she is –most of my exposure to him was second hand , and it was more than thirty years ago , when I was eighteen and nineteen years old .
Anything that provides fodder to anti-Semites is unfortunate , but it 's hardly surprising that the most politically ambitious exponents of Straussianism would have found each other in Washington and formed a clique - College Republicans , Dartmouth Review editors , born again Christians and students of Robert Bork do the same thing .
There 's a creepily culty quality to the ism that his name is attached to today , which never quite made it into the mainstream of American academia , suffered a major backlash in the '60s and ' 70s , and is experiencing another today , during the reaction against George W. Bush .
Most of those guys are bad actors and some of them must have real chips on their shoulders .
But do they rise to the level of a cult or a conspiracy or a secret society ?
I suspect not .
Freecell Solitaire is a highly popular game , made famous by Microsoft .
Freecell is included in Windows , and is considered a classic solitaire game by many .
Because you can see ALL the cards right from the start , there is no luck involved , making Freecell one of the few solitaire games which is based totally on the player 's skill .
Freecell is quite a hard game , but despite that , all deals ( except for deal number 11982 ) are solvable in the 32000 deals in Microsoft 's version .
USING FREECELLS WISELY
The key to finishing Freecell is judicious use of the freecells .
They should be used as temporary storage - only storing cards in them for a short time to help you move longer sequences around .
For example , suppose you had a column with the following ( taken from deal 14396 )
5 Hearts
Ace Spades
Ace Hearts
4 Clubs
In this situation , it is okay to move the 4 of Clubs to a freecell , because we know that right after that , we can move the two Aces to the foundation , and then move the 4 of Clubs back from the freecell onto the 5 of Hearts .
See how the freecell was only used temporarily ?
SAFE MOVES
There are certain moves you can make at any time in Freecell and know it wont " trap " you later on in the game .
You can move the Aces ( and the twos when they can be played ) , at any time , as no other cards depend on them .
For the other cards , you can safely move them to the foundation if the cards one less in rank , of the opposite color , are already in the foundation .
For example , you can safely move the 5 of Diamonds , if the black 4s have already been moved to the foundation .
Better Freecell games will automatically do these safe moves for your , so you can concentrate on the moves that matter , rather than having to manually make inconsequential moves .
THE NEED TO EMPTY COLUMNS
Your first goal in Freecell is to empty a column .
Why is this ?
Because an empty column allows you to move longer sequences around .
The size of the sequence you can move in Freecell is based on the number of available freecells and empty columns .
The more empty freecells and columns you have , the longer the sequence is that you can move .
The formula for how many cards you can move is :
( number of empty freecells + 1 ) * 2 ^ ( num empty columns )
For the less mathematically inclined , here is a table showing how many cards you can move in some different scenarios …
A B C
0 0 1
0 1 2
0 2 3
0 3 4
0 4 5
1 0 2
1 1 4
1 2 6
1 3 8
1 4 10
2 0 4
2 1 8
2 2 12
2 3 16
2 4 20
A: Empty Columns
B: Empty Freecells
C: Card Sequence Length
As you can see , empty columns are particularly valuable , as they allow you to move considerably longer sequences .
By the time you have two columns free ( particulaly with two or more freecells free ) , you can move very long sequences , and the game is usually quite easy to complete from there .
HOW TO EMPTY COLUMNS
So what is the easiest way to empty a column ?
Start by emptying columns that do n't have any Kings in them .
A column with a king can't be emptied initially , because there is nowhere for the King to go .
Do n't just make moves because you can .
Have some mini plan in mind , and only move cards if they help empty the column you are aiming for .
Another popular strategy is just to go straight for releasing the Aces , and then the 2's , etc .
This strategy is easier , and requires less thought .
It will work for the easier games , but wo n't help on the hard deals ( such as deal 1941 )
The most important strategy of all though , is to try and keep the freecells empty .
If you can do that , and empty a couple of columns as well , then you should find it very easy to finish the game .
Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) , who ca n’t seem to hold onto a chief of staff for more than a year at a time , has now lost her fundraising firm as well .
According to a report which first appeared in Roll Call on Wednesday , “ The Gula Graham Group , a Republican fundraising and consulting firm , ended their three - year relationship with Bachmann last week . ”

The Gula Graham Group arranges fundraising events for a select group of Republican members of Congress , like the “ Happy Hour ” they put on for Bachmann last spring at the Sonoma Restaurant and Wine Bar with an admission fee of $ 500 per attendee .
The firms ’s co-founder , Mike Gula , told Roll Call , “ I can confirm that the Gula Graham Group no longer works for Congresswoman Bachmann .
We chose to go in a different direction . ”
Bachmann also lost her chief of staff , Michelle Marston , just last month .
“ I ’m just not talking about it , and frankly I do n’t think there ’s a story here , ” Marston told Politico at the time .
A conservative Republican member of the House , however , suggested the real problem was that “ when your captain ’s crazy , it ’s time to find a new ship . ”
Marston had joined Bachmann ’s staff only last February , replacing Rich Dunn , who had n’t held the positiion very long either .
In April 2008 , Think Progress noted of Bachmann , “ The Hill reports that ‘ ten of the 14 people ’ she ‘ hired early last year have left ’ her office .
‘ The casualty list includes two chiefs of staff , a district director , a press secretary , two legislative assistants , a staff assistant , a caseworker , an outreach and grants coordinator and a district scheduler . ’
A third chief of staff ‘ rescinded his decision to take the position prior ’ to being officially placed on the payroll . ”
A comparison of the Gula Graham Group ’s current client listing with a version in the Google cache , shows that Rep. Jim Gerlach ( R - PA ) has recently been dropped from the list as well .
Gerlach , however , was a client of Mike Gula ’s for many years , and his departure might merely reflect the fact that he is now running for governor of Pennsylvania and not seeking reelection to Congress .
In Bachmann ’s case there is no such obvious explanation
More ACTA Details Leak : It 's An Entertainment Industry Wishlist

The latest round of " negotiations " over the ACTA treaty continue in secret due to as yet unexplained national security reasons ( despite the fact that the entertainment industry lobbyists have had full access to the document ) are kicking off in Korea .
Once again is becoming clear that the claims by US trade reps that ACTA did not represent any kind of major change in copyright law , and thus did n't require public scrutiny , are nothing more than a myth .
Despite ridiculous efforts to keep the document secret ( some countries were given only physical , watermarked , copies of the latest drafts ) , some of the details are leaking out and it's not pretty at all .
The plan is modeled on the ridiculously misnamed " free trade agreement " between the US and South Korea from a few years back .
It 's misnamed because it was n't about free trade at all , but massive protectionism for the American entertainment industry .
The end results have n't been pretty .
The treaty pushed South Korea to implement new copyright laws that are perhaps the most draconian around , getting the country to be the first to kick people off the internet based on accusations of file sharing , and putting so much liability on third parties that various user - generated content services have had to turn off the ability to upload all sorts of content ( no videos on YouTube , no music on blogs ) and has resulted in ISPs even banning any kind of advertising that might make them liable for copyright infringement .
It 's Hollywood 's dream .
It would require signing countries to implement a more draconian version of the DMCA , including incredibly restrictive anti-circumvention wording that has no exception for fair use .
It would put liability on third parties for the actions of their users ( in other words , it would n't include current DMCA - style safe harbors ) .
It would create incentives to kick people off of the internet for file sharing .
This is not about free trade at all .
This is an entertainment industry - written bill designed to recreate the internet in its image -- as a broadcasting platform , rather than one used for user - generated content and communication .
This is n't about free trade .
This is n't about " anti-counterfeiting . "
This is the " Protect the American Entertainment Industry " treaty .
And , of course , it 's not even close to necessary .
As happy as the entertainment industry is about what 's been happening in South Korea lately , before these laws passed , the industry there ( though , not the local subsidiaries of stodgy American entertainment firms ) were adapting in amazing and fascinating ways , that did n't require new laws , but embraced what was actually happening .
Yet , because the American record labels and movie studios do n't want to change with the times , they 're pushing through these laws , outside the judiciary process , sneaking it through via a secretive international treaty they had a hand in writing .
There is simply no reason for ACTA , at all .
It is nothing but an attempt by the entertainment industry to put massive restrictions on the internet , place liability on lots of third parties , and do nothing to push themselves to adapt to a changing marketplace with new business models .

At this week ’s congressional hearings on the AIG bailout , Swiss bank UBS received some undeserved praise .
UBS was one of eight large investment banks that benefited from the now - infamous backdoor bailout of AIG — resulting in government cash infusions totaling $ 182.5 billion — in the dark days of September 2008 .
At the hearing , the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program , Neil Barofsky , revealed to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that UBS was the only bank willing to settle its soured credit default swaps ( CDS ) contracts for less than their face value .
Why did UBS play ball when all the other banks did n’t ?
As the Washington Independent reported , “ Barofsky speculated that the firm probably simply recognized that the American taxpayers ‘ had taken the global economy on its back . ' ”
The financial crisis has proved time and again , big banks do n’t account for taxpayers — except when they need their help .
And that ’s the more likely explanation for UBS ’ good behavior during the AIG rescue .
Like the rest of the global financial industry , UBS was hurting from the subprime mortgage meltdown .
( The bank ’s colossally bad bet on the US housing market — it had already written down $ 38 billion in bad loans as of April 2008 — earned UBS the nickname Used to Be Smart . )
But unlike its intransigent peers on Wall Street , the Swiss banking giant also faced the mounting threat of a US federal investigation .
It was in no position to play hardball .
At the time of the backdoor bailout , UBS was under scrutiny from both the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission as a result of information disclosed to them by a whistleblower — one of their former bankers , Bradley Birkenfeld .
As the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations reported in July 2008 , UBS had hidden from American authorities “ an estimated 19,000 accounts in Switzerland for US clients with assets valued at $ 18 billion . ”
Half a year later , UBS would agree to pay a record - breaking $ 780 million penalty to the US government and turn over 4,500 client names to avoid an indictment that FINMA , the Swiss regulatory agency , said “ would have threatened its existence . ”
Despite what some brazen Wall Street CEOs now claim , the credit crunch was an existential threat to every over - leveraged big bank .
What ’s most shocking about the AIG bailout — besides the dizzying amount of taxpayers ’ money involved — is that these endangered banks were able to extract such a sweet deal from the government .
The banks were paid the full value of all the CDS contracts they had made with AIG — including those mortgage - backed securities they had bought when it was clear the subprime market was collapsing .
After the housing market took a nosedive , these contracts were , of course , worth a fraction of their original value on the open market : Similar CDSs issued by other insurers that were settled during the crisis paid out at 13 cents on the dollar .
Talking about the AIG deal with New York magazine , a former state insurance commissioner described it as being able “ to collect on an insurance policy without having the loss . ”
Why did n’t the government push for a tougher deal ?
At the Oversight Committee hearing , Barofsky revealed that as the New York Fed negotiated with AIG ’s trading partners about how much they would receive for their CDSs , it only dealt with mid-level managers at the banks , not top executives .
Barofsky asked , “ Would it have made a difference if [ then - Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and then - New York Fed chief Tim Geithner ] talked to the CEOs ?
We ’ll never know because the effort was simply not taken . ”
Now , even the settlement the Department of Justice extracted from UBS looks to be in jeopardy .
To avoid prosecution , UBS immediately paid its fine and disclosed 250 of the promised 4,500 names of holders of the hidden accounts .
But the Swiss high court ruled that disclosure a violation of the country ’s banking secrecy laws .
This could prevent the handover of the other secret accounts — and could hinder the US government ’s efforts to collect the fines owed by their owners .
And as it turns out , UBS ’ offer to accept a lower payout on its bad derivatives bets never came to anything in the end .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told the House panel that , even in its weakened state , UBS only offered to bargain “ if everybody else would agree to equal concessions on their prices . ”
The other banks that had traded with AIG declined to do so , and so UBS received full payment on its CDS contracts , just like the others .
The only good bank is one that does n’t need to be bailed out .

Conner Hendricks opened up the show with breaking news .
Concerning the investigation of the death of Breonna Taylor , CBS reports that the grand jury recommends officer Brett Hankinson be charged with three counts of first degree wanton endangerment for firing into a neighbor ’s home but none of the officers are being charged with Taylor ’s death .
Growing up in my house , we always made our own holiday gifts .
We were pretty poor , and I suppose it was our only option .
But it was never presented to me like that ( I did n’t even know what ‘ poor ’ was , really , and I had a stupendously fabulous childhood full of ‘ thing finding ’ and ‘ government cheese ’ .
But that ’s another story . )
It was all about crafting our caring into something unique , something personal .
My mom and I made play - doh ornaments , or baskets of baked goods , or clay coffee mugs .
And , I guess , the tradition has just continued .
The first holiday season that Damian and I spent together , I was a starving college student .
So I thrifted the softest cashmere sweater I could find ( this was pre-vegan ) , disassembled it , and sewed it into a pillowcase .
I needlepointed ‘ Damian ’s Head Here —->’ into the corner .
Damian , who is sort of obsessed with really soft things , loved it .
It ’s still on our bed .
Last year we made all our gifts together – our attempt at canning .
All our friends and family got our truly terrible plum syrup , sugar - free strawberry jam , and tomato starter sauce .
Hey , it was our first time !
And it ’s the thought that counts , right ?
Anyway , there I go reminiscing .
Pregnancy and the holidays have got me all nostalgic !
But all of this story - telling serves a purpose : to introduce this years gift projects .
First up – candle making !
How To Make Candles In A Crock Pot
All you need is some wax , some wicks + wick bases , and some candle - holders .
I used soy wax because it ’s vegan and I think it makes superior quality candles ( just my preference , I love soy candles ! ) .
It ’s available at any craft store along with a selection of other options .
I used precut wicks that came in their bases , because they were really cheap .
But you can also buy wick string and cut it yourself .
Both are available at the craft store .
For candle holders , I just used a bunch of shot glasses I ’d purchased years ago for a party , and never even opened .
You could also upcycle your old candle holders , or hit the thrift stores for anything from shot glasses to tea cups , whatever you can imagine can become a funky candle holder .
Optional additions include color ( candle dye is available at the craft store ) and smell .
I used eucalyptus essential oil , but you can also buy scents specifically designed for candles ( though you certainly do n’t need to and can use any essential oil you ’ve got ) .
You ’ll also probably want a wooden skewer for stirring hot wax ( a chopstick or a length of wire , like from a hanger , would probably work just as well )
Once you ’ve gathered all your supplies , set aside some time when you ’ll be around the house for a couple of hours .
I made these candles on Sunday afternoon , whilst cleaning the kitchen and then suggling with the husband for movie time .
Just make sure you ’ll be nearby and available for frequent checks .
You do n’t want to deal with a waxy mess ( or worse ! ) .
1 ) Spoon the pieces of wax into your candle holders and arrange them in the bottom of the crock pot .
Do n’t overcrowd and definitely do n’t stack !
Turn the crock to high , cover , and go do something else .
2 ) 20 -30 minutes later you can check back .
Your wax will probably be melted and you ’ll probably notice your candles are n’t as full as you ’d like .
So carefully add more wax to each container .
You may have to do this for a few rounds .
3 ) When the candles are as full as you like and you ’ve let them get good and hot and melty , it ’s time to add the essential oils .
You ’ll need to call for an assistant .
“ Assistant ! ”
3.5 ) He was very helpful .
So , using a dropper add 5 - 15 drops of your odor - of - choice to each candle .
I wanted a more mild , mellow vibe so I only used 5 drops .
If you were to use color , this is where you would add the dye as well .
4 ) Stir it up !
( note bulging belly creeping into the pic )
5 ) Add your wicks .
Carefully insert them and make sure they ’re centered .
They should stay straight up on their own , so do n’t worry about that .
6 ) Turn the crock pot off .
Leave it uncovered .
Go do something else .
Over the next few hours the wax will cool and harden .
They ’ll be hard enough to handle if you ’d like to remove them after a few hours , but give them at least 6 + hours before you really toss ‘ em around .
They need plenty of time to get good and set .
And that ’s it , just a few hours of monitoring and six easy steps gets you these adorable , customized gifts that anyone would be delighted to receive .
They ’re so cute , no ?
Happy Holidays !
SAN FRANCISCO — Google Inc. said Tuesday it will let publishers set a daily limit on the number of articles readers can view for free through the Internet giant 's search engine .
The change , which will let publishers limit readers to five free articles per day , comes as news executives step up their war of words against Google , which they claim is pocketing advertising profits on the back of their free content .

Facebook said on Monday it is blocking a website called " Web 2.0 Suicide Machine " that helps users delete their social network profiles .
The number one social network also said it had sent a " cease - and - desist " letter to another website , Seppukoo.com , which also helps you kill off your virtual identity .
The Web 2.0 Suicide Machine site , which features a hangman 's noose on its homepage , deletes profiles , friends and other information on Facebook , MySpace , Twitter and LinkedIn for users who provide their account information .
" This machine lets you delete all your energy sucking social - networking profiles , kill your fake virtual friends , and completely do away with your Web2.0 alter ego , " it says .
Facebook , in a statement to AFP , said the suicide site was in violation of Facebook rules .
Did you know ?
Unless you have a 3 M bps internet connection , you can't use Facebook .
Without 12 M bps internet , you can't even email files !
And just forget streaming video without at least 18 M bps internet .
Welcome to the internet , according to AT&T .

This chart for AT&T U - Verse internet makes no sense whatsoever .
For one , what 's the difference between " watching TV / video clips " and " streaming video " and why does one need just 12 measly megabits , while the other needs 18 ?
Also , the numbers just do n't work .
Even full HD 1080 p streaming video through Zune on Xbox Live just requires 10 M bps - 12 M bps of bandwidth .
If anything , it 's the internet gaming that needs 12 M bps , as I was sadly reminded while trying to download the entirety Left 4 Dead 2 over the 6 M bps AT&T DSL I 've got in GA — the fastest internet AT&T will give me .
I 'd console myself with Hulu , but you know , it might not work .

Colorado State University administrators released a draft weapons - control policy Wednesday that would ban all firearms from campus .
And while CSU ’s Board of Governors is expected to enact the policy at its Feb. 23 meeting , student leaders say they wo n’t give up their right to carry concealed weapons on the Fort Collins and Pueblo campuses without having another say in the issue .
“ Oh , there is no doubt we will respond to it , ” said Matt Strauch , spokesman for the student government at CSU - Fort Collins .
CSU remains one of the few U.S. universities without a concealed - weapons prohibition .
The issue has sharply divided campus communities since December , when student , faculty and administrative groups split over whether to ban concealed weapons .
Faculty members voted for the ban .
Student leaders at the campuses voted against it .
On Dec. 5 , CSU ’s governors voted 9 - 0 to prohibit concealed weapons on campus but left the details up to administrators .
They will vote next month on the plan drafted by a group that included campus lawyers , police chiefs and the presidents ’
Cabinets .
CSU spokesman Brad Bohlander said university administrators expect to hear much about the issue before Jan. 29 , the deadline for submitting comments .
“ It ’s been given to the campus community at large , ” Bohlander said .
“ It ’s also been sent to various groups on campus , including faculty council , student government and various employer groups as well .
“ We tried to get it out to as many people as we could . ”
The proposed policy would outlaw all firearms on campus , including guns held by people with a concealed - weapons permit .
It includes items such as handguns , shotguns , rifles , bows , crossbows , Tasers , stun guns , pellet guns , machine guns , grenades and blasting caps .
CSU - Pueblo student body president Steve Titus said he was surprised when student leaders voted 8 - 1 on Monday against a concealed - weapons ban .
“ There is this idea that this would infringe on someone ’s constitutional rights , but it really is n’t , ” Titus said .
“ We ’re just trying to do everything we can to make classrooms safer . ”
Even so , the Pueblo student group is hoping Tasers and stun guns can be allowed under the ban , Titus said .
Many students consider those useful for self - defense , he said .
In December , student government leaders argued that concealed weapons would keep them safer by discouraging attacks similar to the one at Virginia Tech in 2007 , when Virginia Tech senior Seung - Hui Cho killed 32 people .
But the CSU faculty and the school ’s governors sided with the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators , which said in 2008 that there is no statistical credible evidence demonstrating that laws allowing the carrying of concealed weapons reduce crime .
The policy takes a risk - management approach that is consistent with the best practices of other colleges and universities , Bohlander said .
It is essentially an extension of the current policy that prohibits weapons in residence halls .
The proposed policy extends those regulations to the entire campus with some exceptions .
The CSU police chief would have discretion to grant written permission to an individual for educational purposes or for other special circumstances .
The CSU chief also could grant a request for an exemption to carry a concealed weapon on campus if the applicant has a permit to carry a concealed weapon in Larimer County or for people covered by a court order of protection .
Police officers , members of the military and Reserve Officer Training Corps participants would be allowed to carry weapons under the proposal .
State Sen. Greg Brophy , R - Wray , has said he will introduce legislation this year aimed at nullifying the proposed ban at CSU .
He could not be reached for comment Wednesday .

Scientists believe this new insight into the genetics of cancer will eventually lead to new drugs that target the specific changes to the gene that helps to trigger the disease
One genetic mutation occurs on average for every 15 cigarettes that a typical lung - cancer patient smokes , according to a study that has identified for the first time all of the mutations acquired during the lifetime of a cancer patient .
Scientists have completed a full genetic analysis of the genomes of cancer patients , and hope the information will lead to a fundamental understanding of the causes of cancer – and possibly drugs and treatments – by identifying the mutations that turn a healthy cell into a cancerous tumour cell .
They studied a lung - cancer victim who had built up about 23,000 DNA mutations in his lung cells that were linked with exposure to the toxins found in cigarette smoke and had accumulated over his lifetime .
They also looked at a patient with malignant melanoma , the most dangerous form of skin cancer , who had acquired 30,000 specific genetic mutations known to be associated with exposure to sunlight .
Scientists believe this new insight into the genetics of cancer will eventually lead to new drugs and tailor - made treatments that target the specific changes to the gene that help to trigger the disease , as well as new techniques for identifying secondary cancers that have evaded treatment in other parts of the body .
" For the first time , we have a comprehensive map of all mutations in a cancer cell , " said Dr Peter Campbell of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge , which led the Cancer Genome project to decipher the entire DNA sequence of tumour cells in order to identify the mutations .
" The profile of mutations we observed [ in the lung - cancer patient ] is exactly that expected from tobacco , suggesting that the majority of the 23,000 we found are caused by the cocktail of chemicals found in cigarettes .
On the basis of average estimates , we can say that one mutation is fixed in the genome for every 15 cigarettes smoked , " Dr Campbell said .
The study , published in the journal Nature , involved the sequencing of the entire genome of a lung - cancer cell 60 times in order to be sure that all of the smallest mutations were identified .
The scientists then compared the genome sequence with that of a healthy cell taken from the same patient .
A similar procedure was performed on the cells of a patient with skin cancer , which is how the researchers were able to show that the malignant skin cells contained changes that resulted from exposure to ultraviolet light , said Professor Mike Stratton at the Sanger Institute .
" These are the two main cancers in the developed world for which we know the primary exposure .
For lung cancer it is cigarette smoke , and for malignant melanoma it is exposure to sunlight , " Professor Stratton said .
" With these genome sequences , we have been able to explore deep into the past of each tumour , uncovering with remarkable clarity the imprints of these environmental mutagens [ mutation - causing agents ] on DNA , which occurred years before the tumour became apparent , " he said .

LESS than one cent in every dollar raised by an Australian charity has gone to its intended cause in its first two financial years , documents show .
The Adelaide - based National Cancer Research Foundation last year picked up $ 387,864 in donations but gave just $ 4900 away , according to its audited profit and loss statements .
The year before , it raised almost $ 197,160 , giving away only $ 935 .
So far this financial year , one of the foundation 's directors says the charity has passed on almost $ 30,000 , but yesterday could not say how much had been raised .
Most of the money raised in the past two financial years went on commissions , management fees , travelling expenses and drivers .
The foundation 's director , Neil Menzies , blamed the start - up costs of a charity .
In heartfelt letters obtained by The Advertiser the foundation , which was launched in January 2008 , outlines its fundraising aims , saying it needs hundreds of thousands of dollars for research .
It says it urgently needs to raise $ 700,000 for ovarian cancer , $ 650,000 for children 's cancers , $ 800,000 for breast cancer and $ 500,000 for prostate and colon cancer research .
" The costs are staggering , but we will succeed again , " its letters say .
Mr Menzies said the company was working hard to improve its margins , claiming it had already given away almost $ 30,000 this financial year to the Royal Adelaide Hospital , Camp Quality , and the Canberra Hospital .
" More will be passed on before the end of the next financial year , " he said .
" We 're changing our structure .
Where we relied a lot on telemarketing , which is labour ( intensive ) , we 'll be more into events , golf days , dinner dances , quiz nights . "
" Within two or three years if we 're able to pass on . . . ( money ) in the vicinity of $ 100,000 per year , that would be terrific . "
The Office of the Liquor and Gambling Commissioner monitors charities , under the auspices of Gambling Minister Tom Koutsantonis , who said yesterday that governments were working hard to make them more accountable .
" This is what we 're looking into - we 're making charities publish all their financial details . . . to make them more transparent and more accountable , " he said .
" While we believe the majority are doing the right thing , South Australians deserve to know where their hard - earned money ends up .
Philanthropy Australia chief executive officer Gina Anderson said it was difficult to pinpoint the proportion that should be passed on .
She said the word " foundation " , often used by charities , did not have any legal meaning , and she said Australia was finally going to accept standard accounting measures for charities .
The Productivity Commission is reviewing the not - for - profit sector .
In its draft report , released in October this year , it found there was a need for wide - ranging reforms .
It recommended a " one- stop shop " for regulation , to ensure community organisations and charities were transparent , and to simplify regulatory processes .

The quest for exact change has ended on many Continental Airlines flights .
Continental , the largest carrier that still accepted cash for in - flight purchases , will require passengers to use plastic starting today , with some exceptions .
To buy alcoholic beverages and headphones on Continental ’s mainline jets , customers will have to use credit or debit cards .
Passengers can still pay cash on regional Continental Express , Continental Connection and Continental Micronesia flights , which are operated by contractors , but Continental said it plans to make these flights cashless in the next four months .
The airline still accepts cash for duty - free items sold on international flights , and for now , on flights to and from China .
Continental said it has not yet worked out how to accept that country ’s predominant plastic , the China Union Pay card .

Massachusetts governor promotes charter schools as districts face budget crisis
By John Marion
27 January 2010
Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick signed into law January 18 a measure that will increase the cap on the number of charter schools allowed in the state and will double the number of charter schools allowed in the poorest performing districts .
The law has its roots in an initiative begun in 2007 , but its passage this month was hurried so that the state can qualify for a small amount of the Obama administration ’s “ Race to the Top ” ( RTTT ) education funds .
Under Massachusetts law , charter schools are publicly funded but privately run .
With an exception for certain special education students , the law stipulates that a charter school be provided as much public funding per student as the student ’s home district would receive .
Although Massachusetts tax revenues have steadied somewhat since the fall — December 2009 revenues were 1.2 percent better compared to December 2008 — its public schools face a looming budget crisis .
By the time its 2011 fiscal year begins in July , the state will have burned through most of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) stimulus money it has used to plug its 2010 deficit .
The $ 250 million it hopes to get from the RTTT program is a pittance compared to the nearly $ 800 million in education funds it received through ARRA .
Local aid from the state government to school districts is heavily dependent on the state lottery , and for decades the ability of cities and towns to raise property tax revenues has been limited by a referendum passed in the early 1980s .
On January 13 , the Boston Globe reported on the drastic measures — including layoffs — being taken in the public schools .
It quoted the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents as saying that “ over the last couple of years , schools have tried their best to avoid [ layoffs ] .
They ’ve virtually annihilated everything else : administrators , textbooks , supplies , infrastructure needs .
But now there ’s no place for them to go but into the marrow of the classroom . ”
The Globe reports that the working class city of Brockton is expecting “ devastating ” cuts to its school budget , while the town of Arlington may lay off as many as 21 teachers and the town of Hingham may eliminate as many as 33 teaching positions .
The city of Somerville , home to office and manufacturing workers and their families , lists in an online presentation the following fiscal year 2009 cuts , which are sure to be followed by further cuts : “ use of long - term substitute teachers to fill staff vacancies , ” the elimination of field trips and extracurricular activities , cuts in library purchases , and the “ deferral ” of vocational equipment purchases .
It is against this backdrop , repeated throughout the cities and towns of the Commonwealth , that the Democratic governor is implementing his plans to increase the number of charter schools .
In addition to the measly sum expected from the “ Race to the Top ” program , Patrick and the state legislature hope to cut costs by weakening the ability of teachers to bargain collectively .
In a press release issued after his January 21 State of the Commonwealth speech , Patrick promised that his fiscal year 2011 budget proposal , due January 27 , will contain no cuts to local aid for education .
Because charter schools are publicly funded , Patrick is at pains to provide enough funding for the increased number of charters he wants to see .
However , his proposed budget still needs to be negotiated with the legislature this spring .
Also , on the same day as his State of the Commonwealth speech , the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development announced that the state ’s unemployment rate increased by 0.7 percent to 9.4 % in December .
Tax revenues will continue to suffer as the economic crisis deepens .
Patrick , a former Coca - Cola executive vice president and board member of mortgage company Ameriquest , is also hoping that an increase in the number of charter schools will provide the “ flexibility ” needed to train a more exploitable workforce .
Despite his administration ’s repeated posturing about educating the poor , its true intent is revealed in the introduction to a 2008 report titled “ The New Promise of Public Education : Ready for 21st Century Success . ”
The report states that “ our existing education system is not adequately preparing every student for success in life and work .
As a source of workers , it does n’t meet the needs of employers . ”
In other words , when poor and working class school districts are opened up to charter schools , the private sector will be able to better train students to meet the needs of big business .
An increased number of charter schools in the state will also allow for - profit companies to expand their operations .
Although state law stipulates that charter schools be non-profit , they are allowed to contract out to for - profit companies .
Sabis International , for instance , runs two schools in the western part of the state and is hoping for a third in the city of Brockton .
In a state that has traditionally been run by the Democratic Party , Patrick and the legislature are at pains to conceal their motives behind lofty rhetoric .
However , in a January 13 editorial , the Boston Globe — the state ’s leading liberal mouthpiece — let one of the cats out of the bag .
The state ’s Board of Education had turned down the application for a charter school in the working class city of Gloucester , but was overridden by the secretary of education , “ in part to impress charter school supporters , including [ our ] editorial page , ” the Globe wrote .
Cuts to higher education in the University of Massachusetts ( UMass ) system have been as dramatic as and more direct than those to K - 12 schools .
When dropping tax revenues precipitated emergency budget cuts outside of the normal cycle this past October , the state ’s colleges and universities lost more than $ 60 million in funding .
They are not covered by the governor ’s promise to maintain education funding in his fiscal 2011 budget , and the University of Massachusetts ’s flagship campus in Amherst could lose as much as $ 50 million in 2011 , according to a notice posted on the school ’s web site by its chancellor .
An article on the eNews web site of the UMass Lowell campus details the programs affected by October budget cuts totaling $ 4 million : the elimination of 52 full - time jobs , cancellation of a popular radio program produced by the campus station , elimination of outreaches to local K - 12 schools , and the expectation that other programs become “ self - supporting ” through fees .
The administration of the UMass system is sure to attempt a hike in fees to make up for the budget cuts .
High fees already precipitated a student strike in November 2007 , and any attempt to balance the budget on the backs of working class students will meet with opposition .
It is worth noting that , in an attempt to disguise the true cost of tuition , UMass has developed an arcane system of fees , including a “ Service Fee ” that pays for debt service on capital projects administered by the University of Massachusetts Building Authority .
As with the K - 12 schools , for - profit companies are trying to make inroads into the UMass system .
According to WMass Indymedia , one of the demands of the November 2007 strike was “ control of and a refrain from the increasing privatization of student spaces . ”
If there was a gold medal for shafting democracy at the Winter Olympics , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper would win it .
Just before the games open in Vancouver , he has halted parliament in its tracks , suspending it for the second time in little more than a year .
Canada will not have a House of Commons until March 3 .
Instantly , we are a part - time democracy , a shabby diminished place packed with angry voiceless citizens whose votes have been rendered meaningless .
Harper did n't even visit the governor - general of Canada for the formality of asking permission as he did last Christmas .
Instead , he phoned her and got his PR man to send out an announcement to the nation .
Rage and shame are flowing on the internet because there is nowhere else for voters to turn .
Even The Globe and Mail , Canada 's national and excessively staid newspaper , had a front - page editorial steaming with reproach .
The Globe often leaves me frustrated , but I was moved when I read it and … did what exactly ?
I took a stand .
I joined a Facebook group called Canadians Against Proroguing Parliament , an earnestly pathetic act that may be part of the reason our nation is so lessened on the first day of 2010 .
Look , I can't even call my federal MP , a Liberal member of the opposition , because she 's effectively out of commission for the next two months .
All that 's left to me is to tell you what it 's like here and why you should care .
Harper , that strange vengeful man you will see in February clapping awkwardly as Olympians leap off mountains and shoot past in the luge , has been on a mission since his youth to turn Canada into a pale , watery version of the United States of America .
Even then , the US was well into its identity - switch into the undereducated , paranoid , self - destructively aggressive overspent mess we watch now with grim fascination .
Why follow failure ?
His reasons elude me , but he has only just begun his mission of the extreme right .
His method : absolute personal control of everything .
Unfortunately , he has a free pass – there is nobody of any stature in his cabinet , and no opposition to speak of .
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff cannot seem to find his place .
The specific intent of proroguing parliament was to smother a scandal , to halt a highly embarrassing and public inquiry into the Canadian military – eight years into its weird little war in Afghanistan – handing over prisoners to the Afghan " government " while knowing they would be tortured .
Another reason was to stack the unelected second house , the senate , with five more Conservatives , reshuffle crucial committees and take the country one step closer to complete hard - right majority government .
Harper , frustrated by his repeated failure to achieve more than minority rule , nurses a venom not before seen in Canadian politics .
Bush and Blair hired people for this purpose ; with Harper it is self - contained .
He torments whistleblowers even as they win public acclaim , scorns climate change evidence and makes an international fool of us in Copenhagen , is bent on dismantling the national gun registry set up after the 1989 Montreal massacre , plans the same anti-drug mandatory - sentencing laws that bloated and blocked the US jail system , and fires federal watchdogs who disagree with him .
Obama 's failures have complicated roots but Canada 's failures have been deliberately engineered .
The Conservatives are mean people .
The Conservative Party was not always like this and Canadians are unaccustomed to this level of cruelty and proud ignorance in public life .
I am fed up .
Powered only by the stoicism on which this winter - bound nation was built – we are n't even frozen any more , thanks to climate change , we are merely damp – I went out last night to see in the New Year with two friends who are government scientists ( sha n't name them , Harper hates civil servants even more than he hates science ) .
One of them , an American , campaigned for Obama in 2008 , the same year she took Canadian citizenship .
We drank a Sandbanks Estates wine – tough little Ontario grape – and toasted a country for which we still have such hopes .
I avoided her kind but sceptical eye .

Advertisement Finnish police have confirmed they have found the body of a gunman responsible for killing five people in a shooting rampage in the southern city of Espoo .
Investigators said 43 - year - old Ibrahim Shkupolli shot dead three men and a woman with a 9 mm pistol at a grocery shop inside the Sello shopping centre .
The body of Shkupolli 's ex-girlfriend , who also worked at the shop , was later found at a flat in the city .
The incident is Finland 's third major shooting in the past two years .
Police were first notified about the shooting inside the Prisma grocery store at 1008 local time ( 0808 GMT ) on Thursday .
Shkupolli eventually returned home and turned the gun on himself
Profile : Ibrahim Shkupolli
A witness told Finland 's state broadcaster , YLE , that the gunman was dressed in black and appeared to have opened fire at random , hitting one man in the head and a woman in the stomach .
The victims were Prisma employees aged 27 , 40 , 42 and 45 .
Two were shot on the shop 's first floor , the other two on its second floor , police said .
Another witness said chaos had ensued after the first shots were heard .
" There were loads of people who were crying , and many salespeople who were completely panicked , " the witness told Finnish radio .
The gunman was later seen walking towards another shop .
He then disappeared , sparking a major manhunt .
The shopping centre was evacuated and cordoned off by armed police , and trains were not allowed to stop at the nearby Leppavaara railway station .
' Domestic ' motive
At a later news conference , police announced a Prisma employee had also been found dead at her flat in the outskirts of the city .
It later emerged that the victim was Shkupolli 's ex-girlfriend .
Investigators said they believed her killing had a " domestic " motive , and that there had been a restraining order in place .
" The four victims in the shopping centre were , in a way , outsiders .
It looks like the incident is linked to the fifth victim , " Chief Inspector Jukka Kaski told a news conference .
" She seems to have been the gunman 's main target and the whole shooting is tied up with the relationship between her and the gunman , " he added .
Shkupolli then returned to his own home and turned the gun on himself , police said .
Shkupolli was an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo who moved to Finland in 1990 , shortly after which he began a relationship with the woman found dead on Thursday , according to Finnish media reports .
Their relationship broke down for the final time last year , when she told police he had threatened to kill her .
A restraining order against him was later granted by a local court .
Shkupolli , who worked for a warehousing company organising deliveries to the Prisma shop , was reportedly also married to a woman of Albanian descent , with whom he had a family .
He had a previous conviction for causing bodily harm and had twice been fined for illegal possession of a handgun , in 2003 and 2007 , according to YLE .
Gun laws tightened
There is a long tradition of hunting in Finland , which has vast areas of forest and wilderness , but until recently gun crime has been rare .
But two deadly shootings in recent years focused attention on gun laws in a country where young people were permitted to own and use a firearm at 15 years of age if they had parental consent .
My parents were just going up the escalator from the first floor when police started shouting at them to get out of the building
Antti
BBC reader , Espoo In November 2007 , an 18 - year - old went on a gun rampage at his school in Tuusula , killing seven pupils and a teacher , before turning the gun on himself .
He had posted a video warning of the attack on the internet .
Then , in September 2008 , a 22 - year - old trainee chef killed 10 people at a college before killing himself .
He , too , had put a video on the internet showing himself shooting a gun .
After doing that he was interviewed by police , but they decided it was not sufficient reason to revoke his gun licence .
After the second attack , stricter rules on permits for pistols and revolvers were introduced .
Handgun permits would no longer be granted to first - time applicants , the interior ministry said .
Instead , they must train for at least a year at a gun club before being allowed to apply for a permit .
All applicants must also provide a note from a doctor about their mental health and sit an interview with police .

WASHINGTON , Jan 26 ( Reuters ) -
The cost to U.S. taxpayers of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001 has topped $ 1 trillion , and President Barack Obama is expected to request another $ 33 billion to fund more U.S. troops this year .
About two - thirds of the money has been spent on the conflict in Iraq since 2003 .
This year is the first in which more funds are being spent in Afghanistan than Iraq , as the pace of U.S. military operations slows in Iraq and quickens in Afghanistan .
HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPENT ALREADY ?
Congress has approved $ 1.075 trillion dollars for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and “ war - related activities ” since 2001 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .
It included the costs in its budget outlook Tuesday .
The war expense topped $ 1 trillion in December 2009 , when U.S. lawmakers approved the fiscal 2010 defense spending bill that included about $ 130 billion to be spent on the two conflicts through Sept. 30 , 2010 .
The $ 1.075 trillion tally includes $ 51 billion for diplomatic activities and aid to Iraq , Afghanistan and various other countries that are assisting the United States in fighting terrorism , CBO said .
HOW MUCH WENT FOR IRAQ AND HOW MUCH FOR AFGHANISTAN ?
The lion ’s share of the spending -- $ 708 billion -- has been allocated to the war in Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion there in 2003 , according to CBO .
Former President George Bush launched the Iraq war in a search for weapons of mass destruction , which never were found .
CBO said $ 345 billion has gone to Afghanistan , where the United States invaded to fight al Qaeda and topple the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 .
About $ 22 billion went for war - related activities in other countries , it said .
The current fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 , is the first year that more money has been allocated to Afghanistan ( $ 72.3 billion ) than Iraq ( $ 64.5 billion ) , according to the National Priorities Project , a nonpartisan budget research group that has a running tally of the wars ’ costs on its Website .
The group included some U.S. homeland security spending in those 2010 cost tallies .
It examines congressional appropriations , while CBO has access to additional sources , including Pentagon spending reports .
HOW MUCH MORE WILL THESE OPERATIONS COST ?
Obama announced in December he was adding 30,000 more U.S. troops to the Afghan war effort to join the 68,000 already fighting a resurgent Taliban .
Defense officials say he will shortly ask Congress for $ 33 billion to pay for the cost of the troop surge in fiscal 2010 .
Future expenses are a question mark , partly because troop levels are uncertain .
Obama says he wants to start withdrawing forces from Afghanistan in mid-2011 , but that will depend , in part , on conditions on the ground .
No departure deadline has been set .
Estimates of the cost per troop per year in Afghanistan vary from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million depending on whether expenditures on troop housing and equipment are included along with pay , food and fuel .
Medical costs for the injured and veterans ’ compensation balloon as time goes on .
In Iraq , the U.S. force is supposed to fall to 50,000 by the end of August , from some 115,000 last month .
The 50,000 can remain until the end of 2011 , under an agreement with Baghdad .
A year ago CBO projected that additional costs for the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts could be $ 867 billion over the next decade , if combined troop levels fall to 75,000 by about 2013 .
WHY ARE SOME COSTS GROWING ?
One expanding line item is the money being spent on on Iraq ’s and Afghanistan ’s troops .
CBO said the United States has spent $ 49 billion to date on training and equipping military and police units in the two countries .
“ That number may get larger in the future because it is central to our exit strategy , which is preparing Afghanistan to take over security so we can leave , ” said Christopher Hellman , research director for the National Priorities Project .
Obama is preparing to ask Congress next week for $ 11.6 billion more to train the Afghan security forces in 2011 , draft Pentagon budget documents say .
WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL RISKS ?
Obama ’s Democratic Party has the majority in Congress but is divided over the wisdom of continuing the Afghan war .
This means he needs Republicans to get congressional approval of the next tranche of funds sometime this spring .
He is expected to get that approval , in part because many lawmakers who do n’t approve of sending more combat troops are loath to cut off funds to soldiers in the field .
But with Americans tiring of war and getting more concerned about U.S. indebtedness , political pressures are expected to grow for winding down U.S. military operations and their costs in Iraq and Afghanistan .

Three top Wall Street banks to award $ 49.5 billion in year - end bonuses
By Barry Grey
5 January 2010
The US media has been virtually silent on the colossal year - end bonuses for 2009 that will shortly be handed out by major American banks and financial firms .
This is doubtless a deliberate response by the corporate - controlled media to popular anger over the financial gains reaped by Wall Street executives , who have been bailed out at taxpayer expense while working people have been left to face depression levels of unemployment and mounting home foreclosures , hunger and poverty .
A brief article published on the inside pages of the business section of the January 1 New York Times ( “ With Bigger Bonuses , An Upside for Banks ” ) notes in passing that the three top Wall Street banks will pay out an estimated $ 49.5 billion in cash bonuses and stock awards .
Those banks — Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley — received a combined $ 45 billion in cash under the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) passed by Congress in October of 2008 .
Along with the rest of the banks , they have benefitted from trillions of dollars in nearly interest - free loans , debt guarantees , securities purchases and other subsidies from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board .
The government has further underwritten bank profits and surging bonuses by keeping interest rates at near - zero and pumping trillions of dollars of cheap credit into the financial markets , while placing no restrictions on the ability of the banks to resume the speculative practices that precipitated the financial crash of 2008 .
Meanwhile , the American people have lost $ 11 trillion in wealth , primarily through the collapse of home values .
For their part , the banks have sharply curtailed lending over the past 15 months , draining more than $ 3 trillion of credit from the economy .
In the fall of 2008 , the Bush administration , with the support of then - presidential candidate Barack Obama and congressional Democrats , sought to sell the bailout to the public on the grounds that it would enable the banks to resume lending .
However , the TARP law imposed no strings on the bailed out banks , allowing them to do with the money what they wanted , without even requiring that they tell the government how they were using their cash windfalls .
The curtailment of lending by the banks has played a major role in deepening and prolonging the recession .
Instead of increasing credit to businesses and consumers , the banks have made large — in some cases , record — profits through speculative trading in stocks , bonds , currencies and commodities .
The same article in the Times cites Robert Willens , an accounting and tax analyst in New York , who estimates that US banks will hand out $ 200 billion in total compensation , a figure that does not take into account the hedge fund industry .
To place this sum in perspective , it is roughly equal to the annual median salary of 4 million American workers .
All of the major banks have been allowed by the Obama administration to repay their TARP cash injections , thereby freeing them from minor restrictions on executive pay imposed on banks that continue to hold TARP money .
According to Willens , the banks will reap $ 80 billion in tax savings from the $ 200 billion in compensation , since most employee compensation is a tax deductible expense under existing tax laws .
The biggest tax break will go to Goldman Sachs , which expects to award its employees a record $ 23 billion in bonuses .
Goldman will save about $ 9 billion in federal income taxes on the bonuses it pays out for 2009 .
Altogether , Goldman , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley will gain nearly $ 20 billion in tax breaks from their employee compensation this year .
Indicative of the year - end bonanza for bankers , the Times reported in a separate article on January 1 that Wells Fargo , the fourth largest US bank by assets , which received $ 25 billion in TARP cash , plans to pay its top four executives a combined $ 25 million in bonuses .
These are to be paid entirely in stock options , rather than cash .
In awarding the bonuses in stock rather than cash , Wells Fargo is following the example of other big banks , including Goldman Sachs .
Under prodding from the administration , banks are paying a greater portion of executive compensation in deferred stock , supposedly to tie pay awards to long - term growth rather than short - term gains .
However , as the Times points out , “ If banks … continue to rebound from the financial crisis , their shares — and the executive payouts — could surge . ”
Since the government has made clear that it will impose no genuine reforms or restrictions on the banking industry , and will spend unlimited sums to protect the wealth of the Wall Street elite , the bankers have every reason to believe that stock bonuses will prove more lucrative than cash .
The government ’s undiminished commitment to rescuing Wall Street was underscored on Christmas eve , when the Treasury announced that it was removing a $ 400 billion cap on government aid to the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and approving cash pay packages of $ 6 million each to the CEOs of the government - controlled firms .
Surging bank profits and bonuses go hand in hand with a dizzying rally on the US stock market .
In a year that saw the permanent destruction of millions of jobs , all three major US stock indexes recorded massive increases .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2009 up 18.8 percent for the year .
The broader Standard & Poor ’s 500 stock index surged 23.5 percent , and the technology - heavy Nasdaq rose 43.9 percent .
From their lows in early March , the stock indexes recorded even more staggering gains in a “ rally many investors had not seen in their lifetime , ” according to the January 1 Washington Post .
The Dow rose 59 percent , the S&P 500 soared 65 percent and the Nasdaq was up 79 percent .
Financial stocks were up 15 percent for the year , including Bank of America , whose share price quadrupled from its March low .
Ford stock increased 532 percent from its low point in March .
In all , the value of US stocks increased by $ 5.6 trillion from the market ’s nadir , the resulting windfall going disproportionately to the wealthiest investors .
A major factor in the stunning rebound in the financial markets was the refusal of the government to impose any serious reforms in the wake of the worst financial crash since the Great Depression .
As the Wall Street Journal noted in a year - end review on January 4 : “ But more than a year after Lehman Brothers , American International Group Inc. , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and Washington Mutual collapsed or were saved by the government and financial markets swooned , it is striking how little on Wall Street has changed . ”
The scale and character of the government bailout was summed up aptly by Simon Johnson , the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , in a review of recent books on the financial crash .
Writing in the December 27 Washington Post , Johnson said , “ The Wall Street executives kept their jobs , their bonuses and their pensions ; they benefitted from unprecedented rule changes and unlimited monetary and fiscal support ; and their firms became even bigger and more dangerous to the economic health of society …
“ The executives of our largest banks ran their firms into the ground , taking excessive risks that even now they fail to understand fully .
But , as these individuals saw it , unless they personally were saved on incredibly generous terms , the world ’s economy would grind to a halt . ”
The Obama administration and the Democrats , no less than Bush and the Republicans , agreed that their chief mission was to rescue the personal fortunes of these executives and the financial oligarchy they represent .

Once a year , I train for a 100 - mile bicycle “ century ” ride .
It is held in Solvang , California .
It is a great way for me to stay in shape , burn off stress and remind myself that great things can be accomplished with preparation , dedication and an unrelenting desire to succeed .
I apologize in advance for the departure from my normal content , but I ran into this recap from the 2006 ride , and thought that it may be worth posting .
“ There is only one way to fail , and that is to quit ” – Brian Hays
Solvang Century 2006
March 5 , 2006 – I have two words to describe the 2006 Solvang Century – “ I survived ” .
I had hopes of setting my best personal time this year , but the weather did n’t cooperate .
When we arrived Friday night , it was raining and then it began to hail .
All of the riders were positive , but there was a significant drop - off in traffic .
For the first time in the six years that I have participated , there were actually “ vacancy ” signs in some of the hotels .
Normally , all of the hotels within 50 miles are booked six months in advance .
All of the local hotels are booked about a year in advance .
The word among the riders was that the casual riders had dropped out .
We went to Tower Pizza and joined other riders to have pasta and tell stories .
Three guys from Orange County were sitting near us .
They were drinking beer and arguing whether they should ride the next day .
One was convinced they should .
The other two argued against it .
I tried to support the positive guy .
I had just bought some rain gear when I checked - in and got my rider ’s packet and they asked me where I got it .
Most of the riders were excited and cautiously optimistic about the weather ( even though all weather reports showed 80 - 90 % chance of storms and the temperatures were around freezing ) .
Saturday morning I got started about 7:45 am .
I had bought extra rain gear and felt very prepared .
I had shoe covers , leg warmers , arm warmers , skull cap , headband and a rain coat .
My family cheered as I left the starting line with about 30 other riders .
A normal year would have well over 5000 riders .
This year , I imagine there were only about 3000 riders .
I was amazed that within the first 10 miles , I saw at least 20 flat tires ( it is really hard to see glass in the road when it is raining ) .
I was just glad to get out of town safely .
There was a steady rain and the roads were very slick .
As we rode into the wine country , I looked back toward Solvang and the sky was dark , but not too bad .
As I looked in the direction we were riding , it was black .
The thunder and lighting lit up the sky and the 25 or so riders around me all yelled “ Bring it on ! ”
We were clearly blinded by our own adrenaline .
Ten minutes later , the “ light ” rain turned into heavy rain and we were all asking each other , “ Are we having fun yet ” ?
I could literally feel my body temperature dropping as I was slowly getting drenched .
I suddenly realized that I did n’t have enough layers under my raincoat .
At about the 20 mile mark the hail started up again .
I felt my bike losing control and noticed that I had a flat .
I said to myself , “ you have to be kidding me .
Is this how it is going to go ? ”
As I was slowing , the hail kicked into high gear .
I pulled off the side of the road and began to change my tire .
In the back of my head , I heard my wife Ellen saying , “ you should bring two tubes ” .
Obviously , I only brought one .
With all the weight from the extra clothes , I figured I would save some weight by bringing one tube .
In five years , I had only had two flats .
Why would I need more than one tube ?
Good thinking , huh ?
Another rider who was getting ready to dropout of the ride pulled off and offered to help .
I changed the tire quickly , but my hands were frozen and I could n’t feel the inside of the tire for glass .
I also had the problem that it was hailing so hard that the tire was filling up with hail quicker that I could get the tube in .
I kept shaking out the hail , but it would fill back up .
I had no idea what impact ice would have between a tube and a tire as I filled it up with air .
I did my best , and got ready to re-enter the ride .
As I was getting ready to get back on the bike , I looked at the road and it was solid white .
The hail had covered the entire road .
While I was waiting for an opening between riders , I saw a rider hit a patch of what was now snow on the road , and crash into the field .
This was becoming a whole different ball game .
About 30 minutes later , I realized that I had been riding in one position too long and went to change my hands on the handlebars and noticed my gloves were frozen to the handlebars .
As I pulled them off the bars , I saw ice prints where my gloves had been .
I pulled into the first rest stop and saw they had started a bonfire and a crowd was standing around it as they got onto the dreaded rental trucks to be taken back to the starting line .
These were the brave ones who were quitting and going back to face family and friends .
I could n’t do it .
I could n’t quit this early .
I was shaking uncontrollably and realized I did n’t have nearly enough clothes on .
I gathered myself and got back on the bike .
About 3 blocks down the road was a split in the route .
To the left was the direction for the 50 - mile ride and to the right was the direction for the 100 - mile ride .
A large group of riders stopped to discuss the options .
I looked to the right and saw one rider taking off .
About 20 riders turned left .
I looked at the guy next to me and said , “ lets go ” .
We both smiled and took off .
We turned to the right .
He hesitated for a moment and then turned left .
I heard him yell , “ sorry ” as he headed back toward the 50 - mile route .
I caught up with three other guys and we rode on .
It continued to rain steadily for the next hour .
I had convinced myself that I had to deal with the rain all day long , when I felt a sickening feeling .
I looked down and realized that I had another flat .
That ’s it .
I ’m done .
The day was over .
I did n’t have another tube or CO2 cartridge .
I stood in the rain watching the other riders go by and could n’t believe how stupid I was for not bringing extra tubes .
In the rain , you ca n’t see the glass on the road .
Normally , you swerve around glass all day because you can see it .
In the rain , you ride right through it .
After about 10 minutes a rider yelled , “ Do you need help ? ” I asked if he had a spare tube and he said , “ yes ” .
Nice !
I am back in the game .
I got the tube in and then stood there again , wondering , “ Who is going to give me a spare CO2 cartridge ? ”
This is like asking a starving guy for his last meal .
Sure enough , someone stopped and gave me one .
O.k. , the biking gods are on my side .
I got back on the bike and continued .
As I rode on , I was still amazed that there were patches of hail / snow on the side of the road and every once in a while I had to slow to ride through a patch .
At about the 60 mile mark , I heard someone yell , “ hey , pizza guy ! ” I turned around and it was the guy from Tower Pizza from the night before .
He said he dropped his other friends , but they were still riding .
We rode together for about 10 minutes before I dropped him .
I was feeling good .
No record times , but I felt strong and the rain had slowed .
I was passing lots of people and felt like I could have had a really good ride under normal circumstances .
The 9 months of training were now paying off – even if I was n’t going to set a record time .
At the end of Solvang , there are a few huge hills .
The steepest is called “ the wall ” .
As I approached the wall , I was completely focused on finishing .
I thought about crossing the finish line and seeing my family .
Pizza guy and I were riding together at this point and we pounded up the hill .
We were pushing each other trying to increase the pace .
We were in about the same shape , so we were doing a good job pacing each other .
It is such a great feeling to climb a hill with someone and push each other as hard as you can .
About a quarter of the way up the hill the hail started again .
He looked over and said , “ You have to be kidding me ! ”
We both started laughing and pushed on .
We had to dodge the riders that had started walking up the hill and were challenged to find a clear path .
As we approached the summit , there was a family parked on the side of the road .
Their car doors were open and they were blaring music trying to motivate the riders to reach the top of “ the wall ” .
The hail was going into their car , but they did n’t care .
They were cheering us on and yelling for us to make it to the top .
I yelled back at them , “ Thanks ! ” Pizza guy yelled , “ You rock ! ”
We started the decent on the other side , and I realized that this was the first year that I hated the down hills .
They were too dangerous .
I enjoyed the climbs more than the down hills .
There is about 10 miles of relatively flat terrain at the end of the ride .
Normally , this is a great , very fast ride into town and to the finish line .
The winds had been bad all day , but this final stage was terrible .
I was in my second to lowest gear and was struggling into a headwind .
Why should I expect anything different ?
I continued to ride with the pizza guy trying to draft off of each other .
At one point we picked up a lot of speed and hit some mud and both almost slid off the road .
This was at 96 miles .
We both looked at each other and said , “ let ’s just finish this thing ” .
As I crossed the finish line , I knew my time was terrible , but I was just glad to have it behind me .
The stats were : 102.1 miles , 5:56 of riding time , 17.1 MPH average speed , 37.7 MPH maximum speed and 2 flats .
All I can say is that it is really nice to have this one behind me .
Giving up was never an option .
I would have carried my bike across the finish line , if I had too .
Having completed this ride taught me that I could accomplish things I never realized were within my grasp .
Every century ride from now on can only be easier .

A man is in intensive care in a north Queensland hospital with facial stings after diving into an irukandji jellyfish .
The 29 - year - old man is in a stable condition after being rescued by helicopter from a yacht moored off South Molle Island in the Whitsundays yesterday .
Mackay Base Hospital physician Dr Dale Hanson says irukandji are particularly dangerous because of their size .
" The nets are able to keep out the box jellyfish but the irukandji - which is quite a small jellyfish - can in fact get through those nets , " he said .
" Generally the irukandji are about the size of your index finger .
It 's got a bell that 's about one centimetre across and then one tentacle off each corner of the bell that 's up to 10 centimetres long . "
' We Can Either Set Up an Army or Flee ' Roma Killings Expose Social Tensions in Hungary
Four neo -Nazis were arrested in recent days for a spate of horrific killings of Roma in Hungary , where economic woes and the rise of race - bating right - wing parties has exacerbated existing ethnic tensions .
Now , the Roma minority is moving to organize its defense .

At dawn on June 28 , the Honduran military abducted President Manuel Zelaya at gunpoint and flew him out of the country .
Conflicting and ambiguous statements from the Obama administration left many confused about whether it opposed this coup or was really trying to help it succeed .
Here are the top ten indicators ( with apologies to David Letterman ) :
1 . The White House statement on the day of the coup did not condemn it , merely calling on " all political and social actors in Honduras " to respect democracy .
Since U.S. officials have acknowledged that they were talking to the Honduran military right up to the day of the coup – allegedly to try and prevent it – they had time to think about what their immediate response would be if it happened .
2 . The Organization of American States ( OAS ) , the United Nations General Assembly , and other international bodies responded by calling for the " immediate and unconditional " return of President Zelaya .
In the ensuing five months , no U.S. official would use either of those two words .
3 . At a press conference the day after the coup , Secretary of State Clinton was asked if " restoring the constitutional order " in Honduras meant returning Zelaya himself .
She would not say yes .
4 . On July 24th , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denounced President Zelaya 's attempt to return to his own country that week as " reckless , " adding that " We have consistently urged all parties to avoid any provocative action that could lead to violence . "
5 . Most U.S. aid to Honduras comes from the Millennium Challenge Corporation ( MCC ) , a U.S. government agency .
The vast majority of this aid was never suspended .
By contrast , on August 6 , 2008 , there was a military coup in Mauritania ; MCC aid was suspended the next day .
In Madagascar , the MCC announced the suspension of aid just three days after the military coup of March 17 , 2009 .
6 . On September 28 , State Department officials representing the United States blocked the OAS from adopting a resolution on Honduras that would have refused to recognize Honduran elections carried out under the dictatorship .
7 . The United States government refused to officially determine that there was a " military coup , " in Honduras – in contrast to the view of rest of the hemisphere and the world .
8 . The Obama administration defied the rest of the hemisphere and the world by supporting undemocratic elections in Honduras .
On October 30th , U.S. government representatives including Thomas Shannon , the top U.S. State Department official for Latin America , brokered an accord between President Zelaya and the coup regime .
The agreement was seen throughout the region as providing for Zelaya 's restitution , and – according to diplomats close to the negotiations – both Shannon and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave assurances that this was true .
Yet just four days later , Mr. Shannon stated in a TV interview that the United States would recognize the November 29 elections , regardless of whether or not Zelaya were restored to the presidency .
This put the United States against all of Latin America , which issued a 23 - nation statement two days later saying that Zelaya 's restitution was an " indispensable prerequisite " for recognizing the elections .
The Obama administration has since been able to recruit the right - wing governments of Canada , Panama , and Colombia , and also Peru , to recognize the elections .
But its support for these undemocratic elections – to which the OAS , European Union , and the Carter Center all refused to send observers – has left the Obama administration as isolated as its predecessor in the hemisphere .
9. President Zelaya visited Washington six times after he was overthrown .
Yet President Obama has never once met with him .
Is it possible that President Obama did not have even five minutes in all of those days just to shake his hand and say , " I 'm trying to help ? " 10 .
The Obama administration has never condemned the massive human rights violations committed by the coup regime .
These have been denounced and documented by Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International , the OAS Inter - American Commission on Human Rights ( IACHR ) , as well as Honduran , European , and other human rights organizations .
There have been thousands of illegal arrests , beatings and torture by police and military , the closing down of independent radio and TV stations , and even some killings of peaceful demonstrators and opposition activists .
These human rights violations have continued right through election day , according to Amnesty International and media reports , and beyond , including the killings of two activists opposed to the coup – Walter Trochez and Santos Corrales García – in recent days .
The United States government 's silence through more than five months of these human rights crimes has been the most damning and persistent evidence that it has always been more concerned about protecting the dictatorship , rather than restoring democracy in Honduras .
The majority of American voters elected President Obama on a promise that our foreign policy would change .
For this hemisphere , at least , that promise has been broken .
The headline from the latest Time Magazine report on Honduras summed it up : " Obama 's Latin America Policy Looks Like Bush's . "

A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology won $ 40,000 in a high - tech scavenger hunt on Saturday by discovering the location of 10 red weather balloons .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced that the MIT team was the first group in the contest to report the latitude and longitude coordinates of all 10 balloons , which were scattered across the United States .
DARPA is the U.S. military 's research arm .
Saturday 's challenge is the latest in a series that the agency has hosted since 2004 .
This contest was designed to test the way social networking and lesser - known Web - based techniques can help accomplish a large - scale , time - critical task .
DARPA said in a written statement that the MIT team discovered the locations of the 8 - foot - wide balloons less than nine hours after they launched , around 10 a.m. ET .
It did not say exactly when the task was completed or how many groups had participated .
Johanna Jones , a spokeswoman for DARPA , said the hunt was designed in part to give the military new ideas on ways to operate in a range of situations , from natural disasters to combat .
The agency said it plans to meet with teams to discuss their approaches and strategies used to build networks , collect information , and participate in the contest .
The challenge was announced on October 29 -- 40 years after the first message was sent on ARPANET , the precursor to the Internet .
DARPA said it hopes the contest will lead to advances in the way the military communicates and coordinates activities among multiple geographically separated groups .
On MIT 's Web site , a link was posted inviting people to sign up to help find the balloons and urging them to invite their friends .
It said the MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team " is interested in studying information flow in social networks , so if we win , we 're giving all the money away to the people who help us find the balloons ! "
It detailed a chain for giving away the money , beginning with $ 2,000 given to each person who first sent in the coordinates of each balloon .
i Reporter on balloon challenge
" We 're giving $ 2,000 per balloon to the first person to send us the correct coordinates , but that 's not all -- we 're also giving $ 1,000 to the person who invited them .
Then we 're giving $ 500 whoever invited the inviter , and $ 250 to whoever invited them , and so on ... " it said .
It was not immediately clear how many people participated for MIT .

A Texas bank is suing a customer hit by an $ 800,000 cybertheft incident in a case that could test the extent to which customers should be held responsible for protecting their online accounts from compromises .
The incident , which was first reported by blogger Brian Krebs this week , involves Lubbock - based PlainsCapital bank and its customer Hillary Machinery Inc. of Plano .
In November , unknown attackers based in Romania and Italy initiated a series of unauthorized wire transfers from Hillary 's bank accounts and depleted it by $ 801,495 .
About $ 600,000 of the amount was later recovered by PlainsCapital .
Hillary demanded that the bank repay it the rest of the stolen money .
In a letter to the bank in December , Hillary claimed that the theft happened only because PlainsCapital had failed to implement adequate security measures .
PlainsCapital promptly filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas asking the court to certify that its security procedures were " commercially reasonable . "
In its complaint , the bank noted that it had made every effort to recover the stolen money .
The bank sought to absolve itself from blame in the heist by stating that the unauthorized wire transfer orders had been placed by someone using valid Internet banking credentials belonging to Hillary Machinery .
" PlainsCapital accepted the wire transfer orders in good faith " and had therefore not breached any of its agreements with Hillary , the bank said in its complaint .
The complaint itself is somewhat unusual in that it does n't seek anything specific from Hillary .
Rather , all it asks is for the court to certify that its systems are reasonably secure .
In an interview with Computerworld today , Troy Owen , Hillary 's vice president of marketing , disputed the bank 's claims .
Owen insisted that it was the bank 's failure to implement strong authentication and fraud - detection measures that had enabled the theft .
" The bank is doing what their attorneys are telling them to do , which is to deny everything , " Owen said .
" They obviously can't just come out and say they know their systems are insecure , so they are trying to bully us with a lawsuit . "
Owen today claimed that Hillary had no idea how or when its online banking credentials might have been accessed by the cyber thieves .
While the transfers were initiated using valid log - in credentials , there were several details that should have alerted bank authorities that all was not right , Owen said .
The biggest red flag should have been that the money was being transferred to foreign destinations , which had never happened before with Hillary 's account , Owen said .
The fact that dozens of transfers were made in a two - or three - day period , many of them involving sums that were outside the normal range of transfers initiated by Hillary , should have been another clue about fraudulent activity , he said .
Some of the transfers involved sums in excess of $ 100,000 , while others were as small as $ 2,500 .
Each of the transfers was also made to a different account , which was highly unusual .
Hillary 's typical money transfers involve the same limited set of accounts , Owen said .
According to Owen , the thefts were enabled by the weak authentication measures employed by the bank .
In addition to usernames and passwords , the only other authentication the bank required was for users to register the systems they used for online banking transactions .
However , that measure was clearly not strong enough , because in this case , the cyber thieves were able to log into Hillary 's account using systems that were based in Romania and Italy , he said .
A memo supplied by the bank to Hillary shows that the bank received two requests to register computers on the company 's behalf just before the attacks .
Though the requests appeared to come from a Hillary e-mail address , the computers from which they were sent had IP addresses based in Italy and Romania , Owen said .
" They never challenged whoever logged in with a different computer .
There was never any red flag , " Owen said .
Though PlainsCapital has claimed that registering the computer represents a second form of authentication , the thefts show that it was n't a strong enough measure , he contended .
" They are trying to get the court to say their systems were secure .
Their memo is the proof that it was n't , " Owen said .
John Floeter , a spokesman for PlainsCapital , said the bank is unwilling at the moment to comment on anything beyond what it has stated in its lawsuit .
" PlainsCapital believes that the filing speaks for itself , " Floeter said .
He also e-mailed a statement from bank President Jerry Schaffner , who expressed regret over the incident .
" It is evident that the loss incurred by Hillary Machinery , Inc. , although regrettable , was not the result of a cyber attack on PlainsCapital Bank , " the statement read .
The case is also unusual because it is believed to be the first time a bank has launched a preemptive lawsuit against a customer victimized by a cybertheft .
Several other cases are pending in courts around the country , in which companies that have been victims of such thefts have sued their banks for failing to implement reasonable security measures .
Hillary is still deciding its next steps , but according to its lawyer , Patrick Madden , the company will next file a response asserting that it was the bank 's failure to employ suitable security controls that resulted in the theft .

NEW YORK , Jan 15 ( Reuters ) -
The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the United States jumped 30 this week to a 10 - month high of 811 , according to a report on Friday by oil services firm Baker Hughes in Houston .
The U.S. natural gas drilling rig count has rebounded sharply after bottoming at 665 on July 17 , its lowest level since May 3 , 2002 , when there were 640 gas rigs operating .
But the rig count is still well off its recent peak above 1,600 in September 2008 , standing at 424 rigs , or 34 percent , below the same week last year .
Many gas producers had scaled back drilling operations earlier this year with credit tight and natural gas cash prices sinking this summer to $ 2.50 per million British thermal units ( mmBtu ) , a 7 - 1/ 2 year low and down some 80 percent from July 2008 highs above $ 13 .
But cash gas prices have rebounded nearly 150 percent since hitting their summer lows , averaging more than $ 6 so far this month , a level high enough to encourage more onshore drilling , particularly in some of the prolific shale basins .
While drilling is still down over the past year or so , traders noted production has not slowed that much , with recent government data estimating that January marketed gas output will be about 2.3 percent lower than in January 2009 .
Many traders agreed rig cuts may be necessary to balance the market , with gas inventories still at fairly high levels for this time of year and demand , particularly from the industrial sector , down sharply due to the recession .

We as a whole realize that them two , Natalia Dyer and Charlie Heaton , are dating on - screen in the arrangement The Stranger Things .

At the point when the supposed couple was spotted together at LAX a subsequent time , TMZ made up for lost time with them and enquired about their relationship status .
“ Is it hard mixing individual and expert lives , it ’s not testing by any stretch of the imagination ?
I ’d envision dating one of my collaborators would be dangerous , you know ? ” the cameraman asked trying to affirm if the two are dating or not .
Dyer redirected the gossipy tidbits , expressing that in the event that it appears she and Heaton are close , this is on the grounds that the entire cast is close with each other .
“ Regardless of whether individuals are dating or hanging out , I believe that our cast simply is cool with one another .
That is to say , I wo n’t represent any other individual yet it ’s been you know .
We ’re each of the one major family . ”
Unsatisfied with her answer , the camera through and through inquired as to whether they were dating , to which Dyer reacted “ Have a pleasant day , ” before leaving with Heaton .
They stated , “ It ’s an intriguing thing to work with someone who you return home with .
It ’s in every case extremely fun .
We ’re OK with one another , so we can play and feel more liberated , and we can discuss it previously . ”

“ What we do for ourselves dies with us .
What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal . ”
Albert Pike
With the holidays looming near , now is a better time than any to exercise our good will .
Whether it is buying mom a Nintendo Wii or helping an old lady cross the street , there are countless ways we can accumulate good karma .
Often , we think of doing something nice as a rarity .
Most people do n’t seem to do it often and we reciprocate by not doing anything either .
It is only during these strange times of holiday cheer that we begin to feel comfortable enough to actively spread love and happiness .
Let us maintain this positive momentum for the following 364 days of the year as well .
For any time of the year , here are some ideas that I find most important to consider whenever we are giving gifts or doing someone else a favor :
1. Have Their Interests In Mind
This may seem obvious but sometimes we can get caught in the trap of buying something that we would enjoy , while ignoring the interests of the person who we are giving the gift too .
Of course , it is not always easy to know what someone else may want .
We can try to overcome this by putting our self in someone ’s shoes , or asking like - minded people what a good present might be .
If you are trying to find something for a 6 year old boy , then you can ask other 6 year old boys .
Similarly , if you know someone who is an avid golfer , then you can ask other avid golfers what a good brand of new clubs might be .
2. Let It Be From The Good Of Your Heart
All too often , and especially during the holiday season , we do “ nice ” things for people out of necessity or obligation .
It is this kind of mentality that can ruin what would otherwise be a joyful celebration .
It is much nicer and much more fun if we actually do others favors out of the goodness of our heart , and not out of some unhealthy and ill - defined obligation .
Find the desire in yourself to make others happy , and by acting on these desires , you will find that you too will become much more happier and satisfied .
3. Make It Meaningful
If you excel at the first two intentions then this one often comes naturally , but it is worth pointing out anyway : make your favors and gifts as meaningful as possible .
There is usually no extra financial burden to doing something with a little bit of meaning , something that shows you put in the time and thought into making a good gesture .
A meaningful gift is one that will evoke a strong sense of appreciation in the recipient .
Something that brightens the person ’s day and makes life worth living .
You also want to avoid gifts purely based on novelty or “ quick highs , ” and instead focus on things that will continue to have value over time .
4. Do n’t Expect Anything In Return
If you expect something in return for your favors then you are limiting the magic of your actions .
A true act of kindness is not dependent on any reciprocation .
The act of giving in itself is all that is needed to experience pleasure and happiness .
If we expect something in return , but we do n’t get it , we may conclude that our actions were for nothing , but that is n’t the goal of giving to others , is it ?
It is probably for the best that we diminish any expectations we may have in getting something in return for our efforts .
This does n’t mean we should be shocked if someone reciprocates a good deed , but it should n’t be dependent on our ability to exercise kindness .
5. Feel Proud Of What You ’ve Done
Often we get immediate gratification after doing something kind for another .
It simply feels good to make others feel good .
But some like to suppress these feelings .
Perhaps it is because they define altruism through “ self - sacrifice , ” and therefore , much like the story of Jesus dying for our sins , they feel that an act of kindness must be at the expense of our own life , happiness or well - being .
I wish to dispel this notion .
It is of utmost importance that we feel good when providing for others .
If we can exercise this will , if we allow ourselves to feel good for our good deeds , then we are more motivated to continue these actions of kindness in the future .
Be proud of your noble efforts !
Be selfishly generous .
I hope this post provides some good food for thought for the next time you are intending to help another .
All acts out of kindness are commendable , but if we can accept some of these ideas , and raise our consciousness regarding what it means to be giving , then we can bring our kindness to the next level .

When I was in 1rst grade we had a piano recital .
I played my song and then a girl I supposedly liked played her song later .
We were sitting next to each other and after her song as she took her seat , I put my hand on her leg .
She then took my hand and put it back onto my own lap and did n't budge with any facial expression .
Rejected in the 1rst grade , doh !
( I do n't recall any of this , but my family has pictures to share the story with any gf I have had since )

When I was in young , I was new to a school .
During lunch break the kids were playing baseball and asked me to be the pitcher .
On my very first pitch the batter struck the ball and it hit me directly in the nose .
As I ran to the nurses office crying and not being able to see ( because of broken nose ) I ran down a small slop tripped and smashed my hand ( clutching my nose ) into my nose again doubling my pain .
Not a good way to become known in my new school .
Not so funny for me but maybe funny for you . :-)

When I was in 5th grade I had a girlfriend named Kay ( as far as girlfriends go in 5th grade , anyways ) .
So we would hang out after school in the playground and chat over AIM almost everyday .
One day my older brother ( 1 grade above ) asked me how far I 've gone with her .
I said we have n't done anything .
He then told me I should kiss her and I agreed , so I did the proper adult thing : I sent her an email asking her whether or not she wants to kiss .
She responded ' ok , ' which had me bouncing off the walls .
At school the next day , I walked up to her at her cubby ( little kid locker ) .
She had a lower cubby so she was crouched down .
So the only logical thing to do was close my eyes , bend over , and pucker up , like in the movies !
As I leaned in , Kay finished packing up and started to stand up .
When I kissed her , we both paused ... we froze in position , with me kissing her butt !
My first kiss :)

I guess I will share an embarrassing story since Kevlar reminded me of one .
When I was nineteen and in my 2nd year of college , I started dating this beautiful girl .
Everything was going great , and the time came for her mom to come and meet me .
When her mom arrived at my apartment , I offered her one of the recliners to sit in while my girlfriend sat in the 2nd recliner .
I had no sofa at the time , so I just plopped down in the floor almost Indian - style with my elbows on my knees .
We chatted for half an hour , telling stories and getting to know each other , when her mom told me something funny .
I can't even remember what .
All I can remember is that somewhere between me being slightly nervous , sitting bunched up , and tightening my stomach to laugh -- a single , loud , squeeky fart rung out across the room .
And even more - so , I remember the room falling silent as her mom awkwardly pretended like she did n't hear it .

One of the funniest moments that happened to me was on my 21st birthday
While we where out at the bars after a long day of drinking and grilling .
I managed to loose everyone ... probably because they where partying like it was their birthday also .
I was wearing large overalls , without the straps strapped cause chicks digged it at the time , anyways while I was being drunk and tumbling outside .
I started walking towards on of my buddys by the cars , as I was walking another buddy came outside to checkup on me .
Alright so I get halfway to the car and .... as my friends described it , my overalls fell down and I tripped and fell face first , but with my legs still standing like I slammed my face down to hold myself up my butt was up in the air with my overalls all the way down to my ankles and my face planted on the ground ....
They said it was like I just gave up and did n't even try to stop it from happening , they said they saw it in slow motion .
So naturally I have no memory up from the last 3 shots I took at my buddies house " like around 7:00 PM , when there was still daylight " until I woke up in the back seat of a car I do n't remember getting into .
" This was around 3:30 AM " .
The reason why I woke up was because someone had turned on the car 's alarm and man , that thing was ridiculously loud .
So I find myself in backseat of someones car and I get out and I 'm all like " wow where the $ # % @ am I ? "
Luckily I was outside my buddy 's house and I walked into his apartment to find people still partying .
I was like " damn my face hurts " and they all laugh , thinking nothing of it , I go and hit on the women .
We drink , we play card games , we chitchat .
End Night .
I wake up and man , I really gotta piss .
I go into the bathroom , " DUDE ! MY FACE !! "

I got married a few years ago and arrived at the airport to go on honeymoon .
It might have been the result of the drinking at the wedding reception , or my body saying thank god you got through that alive , or just a bug .
But at the airport after we'd checked in I developed an upset stomach .
I left my wife with our hand luggage and ran off to the toilet .
I came back a little while later , feeling a bit better .
But my wife was laughing her head off when she saw me .
I 'd managed to split my trousers , a long split from front to back and had n't even noticed .
I 'd not even noticed people looking and laughing .
We had twenty minutes until our flight so fortunately I had time to buy some new trousers , because all my other clothes were in my suitcase already checked in .
Just as well there was somewhere to buy some , because otherwise I 'd have had to spend five hours on a plane then another hour getting through the airport wearing trousers split front to back .
And really , the split was nothing to do with the upset stomach .
It was bad , but not that bad !!!

Not so much funny for me , but for mostly everyone else involved .
Quite some years ago , I started getting interested in a barmaid who worked at one of our local nightclubs .
So one night , I decided to pluck up the courage , and ask her out .
I can only assume it did n't go too well . ;)
We started the night off by having some booze at home , being cheap students trying to squeeze in some drinks before we have to pay club prices .
Plus I wanted a little dutch courage .
I remember getting into the club .
And then waking up in bed the next day .
Everything else I had to be told .
My mates remember seeing me with a pint in each hand , a mouthful taken from each .
Then after a circuit of the club , seeing me with two new pints ( it was only a small club ) .
I was next found , as the club kicked out , lying in the gutter , crying , wailing about how much " it " hurts , while getting mocked by all the clubbers leaving for thier journies home .
One of my best mates managed to pick me up , and get me walking to a local cab office , to get me home .
While waiting for our cab ( it was a bit of a wait , the office was packed ) , I needed to relieve myself , so stumbled over to a nearby wall and started .
Of course , at this point , my cab turns up .
My mate calls for me , and I turn around and walk towards the clud , without zipping up ( and possibly stopping yet ) .
After the ride home , I tumble out of the cab , crack a kneecap , and then throw up in my lap .
My mate finally gets me home , and the next thing I know is waking up the next morning wondering how the night went .
I did n't go back tot he club for about 6 months .
But this story does n't hold a candle to that of an old workmate of mine , who woke up naked on the roof of a Woolsworth store . ;)

EST Great contest Kingelfstone !
Very classy way to bow out !
It 's a shame to lose you !
Anyways , my story .
In high school I was into debate , and it was a weekend .
There was 5 of us : the coach , two girls , my friend / debate partner , and myself .
We had set out plenty early to get to the destination town that was having the debate tournament , so we had extra time and decided to stop at a Dillons store for snacks and breakfast food .
Our coach stayed in the school suburban while the rest of us ran in and grabbed some donuts , oj , and whatever .
We did n't have a lot of time though , so we ran in , grabbed our stuff really fast , and ran out and jumped in the suburban .
The two girls had already sat down in the back seat , and my friend and I were about to , when we suddenly came up with a winner of a question .
Since when did the school suburban have a car seat in the middle seat ?
With a collective gasp we all jumped out , and looked around bewildered , only to find our debate coach a few spots over crying he was laughing so hard .
Well , I thought it was funny at the time .
We were all pretty embarressed .
Oh , and I know the contest is for funny stuff that happened to us , but a friend from work told me this great story that happened to him .
Not sure if it 's true , but I 'll let you judge that .
My friend was in basic training , and things were n't going so well for their squad ( or whatever the groups are called ) .
They were sloppy , people were doing things wrong , etc .
So their commander , an officer who was this pretty smart guy with a college degree , told all of the group leaders to have everyone show up the next day ' en masse ' and assumed they would know what to do .
The next day he goes out to find every single person wearing their gas mask and in formation .
Apparently if you 're not sure what en masse means it sounds somewhat similar to ' in masks ' and they heard / assumed that was what he wanted .
According to my friend , this really did n't help his anger about things being done wrong very much .
Again , not sure if it 's true , but makes me chuckle all the same .

Military training does have some very funny moments after all .
I had my first class of new recruits , they were so new that they had n't even put on uniforms yet , they were wearing the civilians clothes they showed up to the base with .
They had already screwed up multiple really easy things so they were already down doing pushups for awhile .
After about 20 seconds of pushups , one of the new recruits stopped and knelt up looking at us .
Of course I went over to yell at him / ask him what the problem was .
His response :
" Sir I think I am doing something wrong , I 'm getting tired and the pushups are starting to hurt my arms . "

Well I guess since everyone else is dumping out some funny stories that are a bit embarrassing then I might as well give this one up ......
I had just gotten out of the Army and was unsure of where I was gonna work next so I called up a few friends .
Well the call netted me a job as Assistant Program Director ( Rank of Corporal ) at a Middle School for a new program they were trying out Leadership Officers Training Corps .
Yes it is a twist off of JROTC and ROTC just remember this involves 4th and 5th Graders .
At any rate things went well I meshed in quickly , the students liked me , the staff liked me and I even managed to net me a nice girlfriend .
People found out I was heavy into martial arts and exercise so they asked me en masse to start up a Tae Bo Class .
I considered it and decided I would be nice and help them out for a while until they could find a full time instructor .
My girlfriend and I were getting serious and tonight was gonna be the night but she asked me a favor or rather heavily suggested it .
She liked men in bikini briefs and had bought me a special pair just for me ...... Pink with her name on them .
Yeah I decided it was a good thing to do as it was a small price to pay sooo yeah I wore them .
Now to tie all this together :
I had gotten off of work early for the Date that I had set up with my girlfriend .
I had managed to get a friend to cover the after school activities with the LOTC students .
To be a nice guy I had scheduled an early class for staff , it went off with out a hitch .
I took my shower and got dressed in the nicely pressed clothes I had gotten out of the cleaners the night before , Nice white long sleeve shirt , pleated black slacks , form fitting undershirt and of course the bikini briefs .
When I was ready I came out and the class was wrapping up with some conversations and of course everyone was like " Oooo lala big date huh ? " and I blushed and answered back yea .
Then she arrived well dressed in a beautiful form fitting crimson dress , yup stunning to say the least .
More cat calls from the staff at me and they escorted her to the side to incriminate me .
I had never told her that I was an instructor at the school just that I worked there so she wanted to see what I could do and the staff wanted to show off what I had taught them .
Yeah I know it 's Tae Bo not much to show but I had a soft heart for these people and obliged them .
Well after a few moves the side kick came up and yup I tore the pants front to back showing off the nice pink bikini briefs and just at that time luck would have it the blinds had been lifted and the after school LOTC kids were looking in and ..... yeah everyone saw the goods ........ everyone said I turned red as a Cherry .
I turned and ran as quickly as possible , without showing more stuff , to the bathrooms to change back into my other clothes .
Of course there was echoing laughter following me ................
For a month afterwards I was called Sensei Bikini Briefs by the staff and Corporal Sharon by the kids .

I was trying to think of something remotely PG when a phone call from a friend reminded me of this gem :
Years back , some buddies and I went camping out in the deep woods and being prepared young men we took with us Bear Mace ( basically pepper spray ) .
Which we never even touched much less thought about during the entire week .
Upon arriving home the bear mace was rediscovered prompting many conversations among the three of us along the lines of " I wonder if this works / What does it feel like ? "
Long story made short , I convinced ' Steve ' to let me give him a quick spray in the face " just to see " .
There may have been beer involved .
Anyway , we went into the bathroom just so we would have ready access to water and easily cleaned surfaces .
So far the plan was brilliant , except for the role Steve accepted of course .
Two lessons were quickly learned on this one .
1 ) Bear mace REALLY hurts
2 ) test spray into the shower so that you have some idea how fast the spray comes out .
My ' quick ' spray basically surrounded his head in a cloud of pepper spray causing screaming and an unbalanced collapse towards the tub .
I reacted quickly to stop him falling and hurting himself ... and unfortunately plowed through the remaining cloud of bear mace ...
So the two of us are lying in the tub blind , choking and possibly screaming .
' Bob ' , third member of the group , pulls his shirt over his face and leans over and turns the cold shower on ( thank god ) then retreats to a safe distance and laughs himself silly at our expense .
The rest of the evening was spent drinking our way healthy while Bob mercilessly ridiculed both Steve and I .
There was , however , one final lesson for the evening .
Bob learned that night how quick and vicious the hand of karma can be .
After the beer and pizza Bob retired to the same bathroom followed by the usually jokes of ' turn the fan on ' .
15 min later an ungodly scream ( as opposed to smell ) was emitted from the bathroom .
Turns out that when you mist your bathroom with bear mace some of it will sink onto the toilet paper .... and lie there .... waiting for the first exposed backside .
So , we three intrepid explorers learned some valuable lessons .
Steve learned that your friends value their own entertainment more than your well - being .
I learned not to be a hero .
Bob , well , Bob learned never , EVER , mess with karma !

Okay my one last story , and this one is true .
I was going to another debate tournament , and this one was an overnight one .
It was exciting , a bunch of us highschoolers and one old coach that had a hard time staying awake through even the debate tournament .
After the day 's work , we went to eat at a spaghetti place .
They are packed , so we have quite the long wait .
One of the other debaters , a fun and maybe even a little crazy guy , nicknamed ' Beef ' , was arguing with his friend .
He was utterly convinced , certain beyond doubt , that the bread knives were not sharp ( the serrated blade knives with wooden handles ) .
After a few minutes of arguing the point , he decided to go and prove everyone else wrong .
So , he took the knife , pressed it up against the back of his hand , and pulled it down hard .
First his face lit up in disbelief , then confusion , then shock , and finally embarrassment as everyone starts laughing .
So now he 's bleeding , the entire back of his hand is cut open , and he 's too embarrassed to ask for help since everyone is laughing .
We did get him fixed up , but man , I 've never seen such a funny misguided idea before .
And no , no alcohol was involved in this whatsoever , which makes it all the better .

I work in this store and around christmas time our boss gives each employee a bonus , and i work only part - time in the store so i usually get $ 100 or so in cash in an envelope from him and this has been the case for several years .
Now this year the economy was bad and the store is n't doing as well so he is so cheap he instead of giving cash is giving employees checks of their bonuses meaning you have to pay taxes on your bonus now and he did n't give everyone out a bonus check at the same time but spread it out over several weeks so people do n't cash it in at the same time .
Presumably because he does n't have money .
Most people got their on Thursday before christmas , but I did n't work that day I did work on Saturday and he gave some envelopes out and finally while leaving early he gives me an envelope too ..... and I open it thinking I 'm gonna be rewarded for all my hardwork right ?
Hell no , its a lousy $ 10 check , i make more in an hour .
So whatever .
Now what sucks is that I can't even spend it cause its not even cash , i gotta pay tax on this $ 10 , and i gotta deposit it at the bank before i can use it .
So i take a trip to my trusty bank .
Now in this bank there are many lines and great businesses where customers are making real big huge business transactions and doing serious stuff and I get in line with my $ 10 check feeling stupid .
Finally I get to the window and scribble my name on the check and i slide the check under the window to the teller .
He looks at the check and gives me a funny look .
he seems confused for a bit and then irritated .
Here we are in the great bank , everyone doing real transactions and i'm wasting his time with my $ 10 check after looking at me funny , he takes out his wallet from his pocket and pulls out his own $ 10 bill and slides it under and gives it to me and tells me to go and not waste anymore of his precious time .

RAMSEY --
A jury rejected a Florida man 's claims that he was too fat to have run up and down a flight of stairs and killed his former son- in - law , convicting him today of murder .
Edward
Ates looked down and shook his head in court as he was found guilty of murder and weapons counts for killing Paul Duncsak , a 40 - year - old pharmaceutical executive who was shot six times in August 2006 .
Read more on the case at NorthJersey.com
The panel of eight women and four men issued its verdict on its second day of deliberations after a trial that lasted more than a month .
Ates , 62 , had argued he did n't have the energy to accurately shoot Duncsak from a perch on the staircase at Duncsak 's home in Ramsey , about 25 miles northwest of New York , and make a quick getaway to Louisiana .
Ates weighed 285 pounds at the time .
Defense attorney Walter Lesnevich said they would immediately appeal the verdict .
Prosecutors claimed
Ates drove from his home in Fort Pierce , Fla. , to Duncsak 's $ 1.1 million home in Ramsey , about 25 miles northwest of Manhattan , in August 2006 .
Once there , they said he climbed a staircase and shot him as he returned from work .
At the time , the victim and Ates ' daughter were involved in a bitter custody dispute after their divorce .
Police quickly suspected Ates and found him 24 hours later at his mother 's home in Sibley , La .
During the trial , Lesnevich said his client was in such bad shape that he could not have pulled off the shooting or made such a quick getaway , driving 21 hours drive to Louisiana in order to create an alibi as prosecutors claimed he did .
" Look at him , " Lesnevich told jurors , noting that Ates was 60 pounds heavier at the time of the crime .
Ates took the stand in his own defense during the trial , saying he had no reason to want Duncsak dead .
But he did n't delve much into his weight .
Some of Duncsak 's family members cried softly after the verdict was read .
Ates ' wife , Dottie , sobbed in the gallery as he was handcuffed and led away by court deputies .
" It does n't bring him back , but at least he wo n't get away with it , " said Duncsak 's sister - in - law , Barbara Duncsak .
" It 's satisfying .
It was a long time coming . "

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , Electronic Information for Libraries ( eIFL.net ) , and other international copyright experts joined together today to launch Copyright Watch -- a public website created to centralize resources on national copyright laws at www.copyright-watch.org.
" Copyright laws are changing across the world , and it's hard to keep track of these changes , even for those whose daily work is affected by them , " said Teresa Hackett , Program Manager at eIFL.net .
" A law that is passed in one nation can quickly be taken up by others , bilateral trade agreements , regional policy initiatives , or international treaties .
With Copyright Watch , people can learn about the similarities and differences in national copyright laws , and they can use that information to more easily spot patterns and emerging trends . "
Copyright Watch is the first comprehensive and up - to - date online repository of national copyright laws .
To find links to national and regional copyright laws , users can choose a continent or search using a country name .
The site will be updated over time to include proposed amendments to laws , as well as commentary and context from national copyright experts .
Copyright Watch will help document how legislators around the world are coping with the challenges of new technology and new business models .
" Balanced and well - calibrated copyright laws are extremely important in our global information society , " said Gwen Hinze , International Policy Director at EFF .
" Small shifts in the balance between the rights of copyright owners and the limitations and exceptions relied on by those who use copyrighted content can destroy or enable business models , criminalize or liberate free expression and everyday behavior , and support the development of new technologies that facilitate access to knowledge for all the world 's citizens .
We hope that Copyright Watch will encourage comparative research and help to highlight more and less flexible copyright regimes . "
" Details of copyright law used to be important only for a few people in creative industries , " added Danny O'Brien , International Outreach Coordinator at EFF .
" But now , with the growth of the Internet and other digital tools , we are all authors , publishers , and sharers of copyrighted works .
Copyright Watch was created so citizens of the world can share and compare information about their countries ' laws . "

I started with the target image here on the right .
I then used a genetic algorithm to try to find an approximation of this image as a sum of cosine waves .
Each cosine wave has the following form
The genetic algorithm can tweak the amplitude , the orientation in the plane , the frequency , and the phaseof each wave .
The image at the right here , is from the 443rd generation of a population of 200 where each gene represents 100 cosine waves .
For the video below , I used a population of 100 genes , each representing the sum of 50 cosine waves .
Image Approximation with Genetically Selected Cosines from Patrick Stein on Vimeo .
Nitty Gritty Details
The genes are represented internally as an array of fixed - point numbers .
Each number is five - bits integer , ten - bits fractional , and a sign bit .
I scale the amplitudes down by a factor of 50 and scale the frequency and offset up by 50 % when I convert them back to floating point from the fixed point representation just to get them into a more useful ballpark .
During each generation , the fittest two quartiles of the population are cross - bred ( in randomly selected pairs with two - point crossover ) to replace the third quartile of the population , and the fourth quartile is replaced by mutations of randomly selected members of the top quartile .
I also run through and remove any duplicate genes and replace them with randomly generated ones so that I do n’t breed myself into a total corner .
I toyed around with two different fitness functions : RMS and entropy .
So , I would calculate the image represented by the gene and subtract that from the original image .
Then , I would calculate the RMS ( ) or the sum of the entropies of the possible values ( , where is the proportion of the pixels in the resulting image that had value ) .
I bothered with entropy because I was hoping that if I could encode a gene in just a hundred or two hundred bytes that I might be able to compress the remainder ( losslessly ) and save bytes over just compressing the original image .
The big problem with the entropy calculation though is that I get the same answer when every pixel value is off by 100 as I get when every pixel value is right on target .
So , for a time , I was multiplying the RMS and the entropy for the fitness function .
For the video and images above , I just used the RMS since it reached very close to the same solution as the multiplying method , and I saved myself fifty histograms per generation .
Source Code
Here is the Common Lisp source code for the genetic algorithm .
It depends on the CL - PNG library for image input and output .
As it appears here , it will create an output image from the fittest member of each generation , an image of the fittest member of the current generation , an image of the original with the fittest member of the current generation subtracted , a Lisp file containing the fittest gene of the current generation , and the current state of the random number generator when the run ends .
For the video above , I quickly put together some code to demonstrate the different parameters that the genetic algorithm can tweak and to show incrementally adding in more of the cosine waves .
Here is some general utility code that is display - independent .
And , here is the OpenGL display code which depends on the CL - OpenGL libraries .
I included the source code here because I had trouble finding an example on the net of using Lisp - created textures with CL - OpenGL .
I render the cosine waves into a buffer , copy that buffer into an OpenGL texture , and draw a quad with that texture .
Note : it looks a little sluggish when run , but that is because I put a big ( SLEEP … ) in there to keep things from flying by too quickly .

A common explanation for the US presence in Afghanistan is Washington ’s interest in Central Asian fuel sources– natural gas in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and petroleum in Kazakhstan .
The idea of Zalmay Khalilzad and others was to bring a gas pipeline down through Afghanistan and Pakistan to energy - hungry India .
Turkmenistan became independent of Moscow in 1991 , making the project plausible .
For this reason some on the political Right in the US actually supported the Taliban as a force for law and order .
If that was the plan , it has failed .
Instead , China has landed the big bid to develop a major gas field in Turkmenistan , along with a pipeline to Beijing .
Turkmenistan had strongly considered piping the gas to Moscow instead , but developed conflicts with Gazprom .
So the US is bogged down in an Afghanistan quagmire , and China is running off with the big regional prize .
On Tuesday , radical guerrillas deployed a bomb to kill 8 persons and wound 40 in an upscale area of Kabul where foreigners , including Indian aid workers , live– in another sign of the deterioration of security in Afghanistan ’s capital .
It is obvious how long a gas pipeline would last under these circumstances .
I ’m not sure very many politicians in Washington were ever really so interested in the gas pipeline .
For someone like then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , making Afghanistan a US base may have aimed at surrounding and weakening Russia and keeping it from reemerging as a peer ( a la the attempted push of NATO into places like Georgia . )
Some US leaders , however , were pushing for it .
In recent years a Turkmenistan pipeline was seen as a way of forestalling India from breaking the embargo on Iran .
And I remember that in fall 2001 , when congressmen asked Colin Powell how the Afghanistan war would be paid for , he replied that the region is rich in resources .
Since Afghanistan is not , he must have been speaking of places like Turkmenistan .
In any case the Chinese just demonstrated that you do n’t need war to get resources .
Avoid costly adventurism and grow your economy like hell , and it all falls into your lap .

In the picture you see a sedan crater than can be visited in Nevada Test site .
You can see how enormous it is when you compare it with the space a platform takes in the picture .
This crater is a result of an underground test of storax sedan and remains the largest man made crater .
The nuclear testing was done in the 60s to look for non military use of nuclear explosives .
The nuclear device buried 635 ft under the ground displaced 11,000,000 tons of soil , leaving a crater 320 ft. deep and with a diameter of 1280 ft .
It is the largest depression caused by a nuclear detonation .
Over 10,000 people visit the crater every year .
The test took place on July 6 , 1962 and resulted in large amounts of radioactive fallout .

Kilencedik alkalommal rendezték meg a No Pants Day-t , vagyis a nadrágmentes napot az Egyesült Államokban vasárnap , ami az évek alatt annyira népszerű lett , hogy idén 16 ország csatlakozott a megmozduláshoz .
Az eseményt szervező Improv Everywhere improvizációs társulatnak nincs különösebb célja a megmozdulással , csak annyit szeretnének elérni , hogy az emberek mosolyogjanak .
A Facebookon , internetes fórumokon és telefonon hirdették a 2010 - es Nadrágmentes Napot ( No Pants Day ) az esemény szervezői , amit 2002 - ben indított útjára az Improv Everywhere improvizációs társulat .
Akkor mindössze heten vették le a nadrágjukat a tömegközlekedési eszközön , idén csak New Yorkban több mint 3000 résztvevője volt az eseménynek .
A Nadrágmentes Napot nemcsak az Egyesült Államokban ünnepelték ; további 16 országban – köztük Ausztráliában és Svájcban - döntöttek úgy , hogy január 10 - én nadrág nélkül fognak közlekedni .
Mosolyogtatni szeretnének
Az egyik washingtoni szervező , Bruce Witzenburg a Washington Postnak elmondta , a résztvevőknek teljesen felöltözve kellett megjelenniük a megbeszélt találkozási pontokon január 10 - én , majd egy előre egyeztetett időpontban felszálltak a metróra , ahol megszabadultak a nadrágjuktól , illetve szoknyájuktól .
Az eseményről mit sem tudó utasok nagy része igyekezett nem foglalkozni a nadrág nélkül közleked őkkel , de volt , aki nem tudta szó nélkül hagyni a szokatlan jelenséget .
„ Mi a fene folyik itt ?
Azt hittem együtt vannak .
De még csak nem is szólnak egymáshoz .
Ez nagyon furcsa ” – véleményezte a helyzetet az egyik felöltözött utas a New York Daily News riporterének .
Több mint 100 akciót hajtottak végre
Persze nem mindenki mulatott az alsónadrágos utazókon : a New York - i résztvevők tiltakozókkal is találkoztak , akik követelték , vegyék fel a nadrágjaikat .
Az Improv Everywhere egyébként egy 2001 - ben , Charlie Todd által alapított improvizációs társulat , több tízezer taggal rendelkezik .
A csoport általában előre kitervelt , meglepetésszer ű akciókat hajt végre , eddig már több mint 100 megmozduláson vannak túl .
2007 februárjában például több mint 200 tagjuk fagyott le öt percre a New York - i Grand Central állomáson , teljes értetlenséget kiváltva ezzel az ott közleked őkből .
Hasonló eredményt értek el a Food Court Musical fedőnévvel ellátott megmozdulással is : akkor egy Los Angeles - i bevásárlóközpont éttermi részében játszottak el egy musicalt , amivel sokkolták az ott sétálgató vásárlókat .
The Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer on Friday joined a growing list of marketers that are reducing or dropping their use of Tiger Woods in ads , amid the revelations of his alleged extramarital affairs .
" The partnership with Tiger Woods will continue , " said Jean - Christophe Babin , chief executive of Tag Heuer , in a statement , " but we will downscale the use of his image in certain markets for a period of time , depending on his decision about returning to professional golf . "

When Dubai wobbled last week , everyone rushed to the Internet to await confirmation of the imminent bailout .
And they saw what they wanted to see !
The airwaves ( and pipes ) were clogged by a steady stream of pundits declaring that there was no way Abu Dhabi would let Dubai go bust .
Why not ?
Because if Dubai went bust , then ... well ... then the stock market might go down for a while !
Then the idiots who loaned Dubai World money to build huge islands and buildings in the desert would have to pay for their stupidity !
Then the buildings ' ownership would change in a debt restructuring -- the kind that happens every day in a normally functioning capitalist economy !
INCONCEIVABLE !!!
Remarkably , against this tidal wave of panic and entitlement , Abu Dhabi stood its ground , refusing to reward idiocy by throwing more good money after bad .
And lo and behold ... the world 's stock markets have stabilized and Dubai is having civilized conversations with its lenders , the same way folks who have had to restructure their debts have had since the dawn of time .
In the United States , meanwhile , Messrs .
Bernanke and Geithner no longer have to assure us that they will never let a big bank fail -- because we understand that this guarantee has basically been written into the United States constitution .
The LESSON OF LEHMAN BROTHERS has been learned , and the lesson is this :
We have become a nation of mamma's boys .
Specifically , after 25 years of debt - fueled consumerism , we have become accustomed to instant gratification and instant fixes , led by politicians and regulators terrified of having to tell us the harsh truth :
We lost our discipline .
Getting it back will make life tougher for a while .
But it will make us stronger in the end .
It was n't always this way .
In fact , the era of prosperity that we 've just enjoyed was made possible by a leader with a huge spine -- one who , unlike our current financial and economic leaders , was n't afraid to risk his job ( and enormous public pressure and disapproval ) to do the right thing .
Who was that leader ?
Paul Volcker .
How much public hatred was Volcker willing to withstand to get us back on the right track ?
Take a look at the chart below .
The red bars are the Fed Funds rate ( which Volcker directly controlled ) .
The blue line is unemployment ( which he indirectly controlled ) .
In 1980 , with the country beset by chronic , runaway inflation , Paul Volcker decided to do something about it .
Specifically , he hiked rates sharply , into a weak economy .
What happened ?
He killed the economy .
Unemployment soared -- spiking from 6 % to well over 10 % , the highest level since the Great Depression .
The economy crashed back down into a double - dip recession .
Millions of Americans were put out of work .
The stock market plunged to 15 year lows .
But Paul Volcker held fast .
And a few years later , inflation was all but dead , setting us up for two decades of prosperity ( and one of letting ourselves go to pot ) .
Fast forward to today .
Today , we are led by men like Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner .
Men who are so afraid of the consequences of making people pay for their profligacy and stupidity that they have restarted the debt bubble ( free money and bailouts for Wall Street , FHA , cash for clunkers ) and made Too Big To Fail a national policy .
Take another look at that chart .
Do you think Ben would be willing to withstand the heat that Paul Volcker took to get this country back on track ?
Tim ?
Larry Summers ?
Do you think any of them would be willing to stand up and deliver the message this country -- and Wall Street - - desperately needs to hear ?
We do n't either .
But at some level , we can't say we blame them .
Given our current national attitude , we would fire them instantly for even daring to suggest such a thing .
But we 'd still be better off hearing it .
And it would make us stronger and better in the end .
Bristol Palin has gone to court , demanding that Levi Johnston step up as a dad and pay her some of the money he 's raked in from his naked media blitz .
Court documents were filed by Bristol 's lawyer late Thursday afternoon in Alaska , demanding $ 1,750 a month in child support from Levi , retroactive to the birth of son Tripp on December 27 , 2008 .
According to the docs , obtained by TMZ , Bristol believes Levi has pulled in " in excess of $ 105,000 in 2009 through various media interviews and modeling related activities . "
The $ 105,000 figure is significant , because under Alaska law a non-custodial parent must pay 20 % of income up to $ 105,000 a year -- which comes to $ 1,750 a month .
Bristol says in her sworn statement , " I have received limited and sporadic financial assistance from Levi . "
Bristol says Levi has forked over only $ 4,400 over the 13 months of Tripp 's life -- $ 3,000 on September 9 , 2009 , $ 1,400 on December 19 .
Bristol 's request is for temporary support , pending a permanent child support order .
UPDATE : Levi Johnston 's manager , Tank Jones , tells TMZ Levi has paid Bristol more than $ 10,000 since Tripp was born .
Jones also says Levi does not make money off of every interview he does , though he did not say exactly how much Levi has made .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - The Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance on Tuesday that will shut down hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries that recently opened in America ’s second - largest city .

The Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance on January 26 , 2010 that will shut down hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries and require them to be at least 1,000 feet ( 300 meters ) from schools , public parks , libraries or churches .

The statute , passed on a 9 - 3 vote , ultimately would limit the number of licensed dispensaries to 70 and require them to be at least 1,000 feet from schools , public parks , libraries or churches .
Rather than imposing a similar buffer zone around homes , the measure would bar marijuana dispensaries from being located next door to , across the street , or across an alley from residential properties .
Los Angeles has some 1,000 dispensaries operating under a 1996 California law that decriminalized cannabis for medical use -- the first U.S. state to do so -- and a 2003 ballot measure that allowed pot to be cultivated and distributed to prescription - holding patients through nonprofit collectives .
But some city officials and residents complained that things have gotten out of control , with many pot shops operating as commercial businesses that cater as much to recreational drug users as to cancer patients .
In 2007 , the city imposed a temporary moratorium on dispensaries , but a loophole in the measure has enabled hundreds more to open since then .
The bulk of those opened last year after U.S. President Barack Obama reversed a Bush administration policy and ended federal raids on dispensaries in states where medical marijuana had been legalized .
Controversy over pot shops has been less intense in other cities , like San Francisco and Oakland .
In northern California towns like Arcata and Eureka , where marijuana has long been part of the social fabric and local economy , illicit growers have reportedly stepped up production to meet rising demand generated by the spread of clinics around the state .
Besides capping the number of dispensaries in Los Angeles , the new ordinance imposes new restrictions on them .
It limits hours of operations to between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. , imposes stringent security measures and requires them to operate as nonprofit collectives , with each patient limited to having cannabis prescriptions filled from just one dispensary .
The Evolution of God by Robert Wright Little , Brown , 567 pp. , $ 25.99
1 .
Robert Wright is not afraid to think big thoughts .
Wright , who contributes regularly to a host of magazines including Slate and Time and who edits the Web site Bloggingheads.tv , has written several intellectually ambitious books .
In TheMoral Animal ( 1997 ) , for example , he considered the young ( and controversial ) science of evolutionary psychology .
And in Nonzero ( 2001 ) , he offered a heady tour of human history and argued that ideas from the mathematical field of game theory reveal how much of that history was driven by the mutual benefits that accrue from human cooperation .
In his latest book , Wright takes on an even grander subject : religion .
In The Evolution of God , he both surveys the history of religion and , more important , offers a new theory to explain why this history unfolded as it did .
According to Wright ’s theory , although religion may seem otherworldly — a realm of revelation and spirituality — its history has , like that of much else , been driven by mundane “ facts on the ground . ”
Religion , that is , changes through time primarily because it responds to changing circumstances in the real world : economics , politics , and war .
Wright thus offers what he emphasizes is a materialist account of religion .
As he further emphasizes , the ways in which religion responds to the world make sense .
Like organisms , religions respond adaptively to the world .
More formally , Wright argues that religious responses to reality are generally explained by game theory and evolutionary psychology , the subjects of his previous books .
Subtle aspects of the human mind , he claims , were shaped by Darwinian natural selection to allow us to recognize and take advantage of certain social situations .
The most important of these — and the centerpiece of Wright ’s theory — are what game theorists call non -zero - sum interactions .
Unlike zero -sum games , wherein one player ’s gain is another player ’s loss , in some games both players can win ; hence “ non-zero - sum . ”
The classic example is economic trade .
In a free market , trade occurs when both parties benefit from exchange ( otherwise they would n’t engage in it ) .
As technologies , particularly transportation , improved throughout history , cultures collided and human beings encountered more and more of these non -zero - sum opportunities .
Religion , Wright says , responded rationally to these encounters .
For example , religious doctrine grew more tolerant of other faiths when tolerance helped smooth economic or political interactions that were potentially win-win : it ’s wise to respect the other fellow ’s gods when you want to trade or form military alliances with him .
( Wright suggests that these responses were often unconscious , not cynical . )

Hill reports on the disturbing increase in suicide chat rooms
Josh began suffering nightmares when he was just months old , waking every 90 minutes and screaming as though , his mother still vividly remembers , someone was trying to kill him .
By the time he was two , he was developing one phobia after another : he could n't go near escalators without almost fainting with fear , while his terror of fire meant his mother could n't even light the oven if he was in the room .
He was five when he first started talking about killing himself .
' I was sitting on the side of the bath watching Josh bathing , when he suddenly looked up at me and said , " Sometimes I just want to die " , ' said Maxine , his mother .
' I almost fell onto the floor ; what sort of five - year - old comes out with such a comment ? '
When Maxine asked him why he felt like that , Josh replied that ' there are just so many bad things going on in the world and I just can't figure out how you would ever stop it all ' .
By the time Josh was hospitalised and prescribed anti-depressants for the first time , he was nine and suicide had become a frequent topic of conversation .
His first serious attempt to kill himself came at the age of 12 and was followed by at least one serious attempt in every remaining year until he finally managed to end his life at the age of 19 .
The exact reasons for Josh 's suicide remain unclear , but his mother has the crumb of comfort that he was supported by others who were in equally desperate situations .
But that support emanated from an unlikely source : he was a regular visitor to an online suicide forum .
Like many others , Josh frequently logged on to the Usenet newsgroup alt.suicide.holiday ( Ash ) , a pro-choice suicide internet message board .
' I knew he used to access these sites and have long conversations throughout the night with other site users who felt as wretched as he did , ' Maxine told The Observer from her home in Ottawa , Canada .
' I had heard the rumours that they exchanged details on the best way to commit suicide and gave advice on how to get hold of the means of dying , but Josh always denied that and told me the sites comforted and supported him , ' she added .
' It was only when he died that I logged on myself to Ash , his favourite site , to see what they really talked about . '
The existence of forums created by and for those with suicidal tendencies came to mass public attention for the first time last week when the bleak story of Michael Gooden and Louis Gillies finally came to a tragic end .
The two young men had ' met ' on the Ash newsgroup in May last year and , within days , made a suicide pact .
After a last meal and a few drinks at the Beachy Head Hotel , at the top of Britain 's highest chalk cliffs in East Sussex , they strode the 200 yards through fog to the edge of the cliffs , and prepared to fling themselves to their deaths .
At the final moment , however , Gillies received a phone call from a shocked friend who talked him away from the edge .
The unemployed IT graduate from Glasgow handed the phone to Gooden , but the 35 - year - old from south London refused to change his mind and ran over the cliff .
' I would just like to let you know that assure - me [ Gooden 's web name ] has caught the bus , ' Gillies announced on the Ash site later that day , adopting the site 's euphemism for suicide .
' He was very determined .
He did not flinch .
He ran over the precipice in UNBELIEVABLE meteorological conditions .
Inspirational , poignant , mesmerising ... I hope he has found peace . '
Gillies 's message caught the attention of police and he was arrested on the unusual charge of aiding and abetting a suicide .
But last Tuesday , on the day he was due to face the court , Gillies hanged himself in his Glasgow flat .
The rise in the number and popularity of chat rooms created by those with suicidal tendencies , to offer a forum in which those suffering similar distress can discuss their anguish , has led to a surge in stories like that of Gillies .
In Norway recently a 17 - year - old Austrian woman met a 20 - year - old Norwegian man with whom she had made an internet pact to plunge together to their deaths from a 2,000 ft cliff called Prekestolen , or Pulpit Rock .
Similar stories have been reported in Australia , Japan and Korea , while in America , newspapers have referred to an ' epidemic ' of pro-choice websites .
' These sites differ in their attitude toward suicide , ' said Professor Georg Felber , chairman of the German Society for Suicide Prevention .
' There are those sites run by people who actively promote suicide , who portray it as the cleanest solution or as a unique , consistent attitude and who offer themselves as a companion in the final hours .
' These sites provide detailed guidance on suicide methods and give directions on how to acquire implements of suicide , such as weapons and drugs , ' he said .
It was on a site like this that a teenager from Tokyo obtained enough potassium cyanide to kill herself from a mail order poison service .
The man who posted the advert , a Dr Kiriko , was found to have enough poison in his stock to kill 3,000 people .
Kiriko has since killed himself .
' There are , however , other sites in which the exchange of suicide fantasies and methods are not welcome , ' added Felber .
' These sites offer users a free space to examine and formulate suicidal thoughts that are otherwise taboo , and that can help them go on with life , feeling that they are not alone . '
Ash , the site on which Gillies and Gooden met , and which Josh frequented , is the most popular , and probably the oldest , English - language suicide internet group , dating back to 1987 .
' Anybody who encourages another to suicide as part of the Ash subculture is resisted and if they are part of a mailing list they are immediately banned , ' said a moderator of one pro-choice mailing list .
' But if someone posted up suggestions of methods they were thinking about using , someone else would come back with advice on which option carried the least risks of it going wrong .
' People have met up in our group and committed suicide together , ' he admitted .
' These people have a sense of being isolated and alone in life and simply want a companion in death . '
' These sites are dangerous , ' said Keith Hawton , professor of psychiatry at Oxford University 's Centre for Suicide Research .
' One of their founding theories is that they should be placed under no supervision whatsoever and feature no input from experts at all , and what you are left with is suicidal people counselling suicidal people , which is about as dangerous as it can get .
' A recurring feature of these sites seems to be the presence of voyeuristic people who get their kicks from encouraging others to commit suicide .
There is definitely a seductive element . '
But Hawton admits that , despite ' racking their brains ' , his colleagues and he have been unable to devise a way the sites can be regulated .
' I do n't see a solution to these sites , ' he said .
' There seems to be no way of stopping or controlling them , just a sad , awful proliferation which will lead to the deaths of more people who , in an alternative environment , could be saved . '
Wall Street 's bonus baby steps
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
So much for Wall Street sobering up .
Under pressure to prevent another meltdown , Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) have been cutting back on cash bonuses and insisting on so - called clawbacks -- arrangements that allow companies to reclaim past bonuses when there is employee misconduct .
Yet for all their supposed reform - mindedness , the banks show no sign of pulling the emergency brake on the great compensation escalator .
A year after taxpayers saved the finance industry from collapse , the big banks will hand out billions of dollars in bonuses in the coming weeks -- at a time where unemployment tops 10 % and many people are still losing their homes to foreclosures .
To say this rankles in some quarters is an understatement .
" There is a need to show restraint considering the unusual circumstances of the past year or so , " said Tim Smith , a senior vice president at socially responsible investment firm Walden Asset Management in Boston .
" That 's what you 're not seeing right now . "
Take Goldman Sachs .
After losing more than $ 3 billion in the last four months of 2008 , the securities firm is on track to lavish some $ 21 billion on its workers for 2009 , now that the firm has returned to profitability .
That 's in line with the amount Goldman paid in its record profit year of 2007 .
Goldman wo n't be the only one dispensing a lot of loot .
Compensation expense at JPMorgan Chase 's ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) investment banking arm was up 20 % in the first three quarters of 2009 , the New York state comptroller 's office estimates .
Even Morgan Stanley , which only recently broke an embarrassing streak of quarterly losses , could pay workers $ 14 billion .
To be fair , Goldman and Morgan Stanley are reforming how they compensate top execs , doling out less cash and issuing more stock that must be held for several years .
But while some banks have been willing to engage critics of their compensation - setting processes , they have n't been inclined to limit the size of paychecks .
When times are good , those can be rather large .
In 2007 , for instance , Goldman 's top five executives -- CEO Lloyd Blankfein , co-presidents Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelried , finance chief David Viniar and chief administrative officer Edward Forst -- combined to make $ 322 million , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings
Though none of the firm's top five leaders received more than $ 5.3 million in 2008 , this year 's giant trading profits could mean a return to the eye - popping paychecks of yore .
That 's inappropriate considering the risks taxpayers took on in financing the resuscitation of the banking sector last year , said Laura Shaffer , director of shareholder activities at the Nathan Cummings Foundation in New York , which owns a stake in Goldman Sachs .
She notes the billions of dollars in Troubled Asset Relief Program loans that the big banks took and then repaid , as well as the benefits they reaped via the bailout of troubled insurer AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) and the expanded federal backstops of bank deposits , bank bonds and money market funds .
All these stand as asterisks to the $ 51 billion in profits that the six biggest bank holding companies -- Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) along with Goldman , Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase -- posted in the first nine months of 2009 .
Goldman alone is responsible for almost a quarter of that .
" There 's a sense on our part that the performance we 've seen at Goldman is n't true performance , " said Shaffer .
Accordingly , the Cummings foundation has sponsored a resolution calling on the Goldman board to report back to shareholders on whether senior executives ' compensation is " excessive , " judging by the gap between top execs ' pay and that of other workers .
The so - called pay disparity resolution is n't the only one of its kind .
A group of institutional investors belonging to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility ( ICCR ) this month filed shareholder resolutions along the same lines at 21 big health industry companies , including insurer Aetna , drugmaker Eli Lilly and mail order pharmacy Medco .
Those resolutions will go up for shareholder votes when the companies hold their annual meetings .
Though it can take years to build enough stockholder support to give a proposal even a shot at passage , would - be reformers are hopeful that the disconnect between massive job losses and soaring CEO pay will win over some skeptics .
" There is a lot of discontent right now among shareholders , " said Julie Tanner , assistant director of socially responsible investing at Christian Brothers Investment Services , which like Nathan Cummings is a member of ICCR .
Putting the details of giant pay packages before shareholders can shame board members into getting a stronger grip on the compensation process , Tanner said .
This is the logic of the say - on - pay movement , whose advocates have enlisted more than three dozen companies -- including Goldman -- to hold advisory votes next year on compensation practices .
Investors are n't the only possible source of friction on giant paychecks .
The Federal Reserve said this fall it will examine bank pay practices , in a review some experts expect to result in some " pushback " for big banks .
But it 's not clear how aggressive the Fed will be .
And while greater disclosure and transparency are surely welcome , they will do little now to bring down egregious pay on Wall Street .
" Putting pressure on boards is a long process , " said David DeBoskey , a finance professor at San Diego State .
" In the meantime , every day is Christmas for these guys . "
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has not read the book he co-authored in 2008 , which includes information on Arpaio 's philosophy on America 's immigration problem and how to cope with the nation 's porous borders .
Arpaio's lack of familiarity with the book , " Joe 's Law - America 's Toughest Sheriff Takes on Illegal Immigration , Drugs and Everything Else That Threatens America , " was among the revelations to emerge from a nine - hour deposition the sheriff gave as part of a racial - profiling lawsuit filed against the Sheriff 's Office .
Arpaio 's attorney , Tim Casey , said plaintiffs are losing the racial - profiling case so their attorneys are attacking the sheriff .
" I thought Arpaio did very well , " Casey said .
" He 's basically a CEO of a several thousand person organization , and he certainly sets policy .
There 's not a single thing in there that helps their case . "
Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres , Jessica Quitugua Rodriguez , David Rodriguez , Velia Meraz and Manuel Nieto , Jr. , all allege in the suit filed in U.S. District Court that deputies searched them without cause or unreasonably detained them between September 2007 and March 2008 .
The plaintiffs are represented by David Bodney , who also represents the Republic , among other Valley media organizations .
Bodney made the deposition transcript available .
Casey pointed out that attorneys are given broad latitude in deposition to ask questions about anything that might lead to the discovery of more evidence that could be admissible to a case .
Among the other details that emerged during Arpaio 's Dec. 16 deposition .
� �Arpaio has not read the racial - profiling claim related to the deposition .
� �Arpaio has not instituted any training for deputies on racial profiling , and he does not believe any training is necessary .
� �Arpaio says he was not well versed on the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , or its counterpart in the Arizona Constitution , which prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures .
He says he relies on his legal team to deal with those intricacies .
� �Arpaio frequently claims ignorance about the details of Sheriff 's Office operations and repeatedly states that reporters misquote him and take what he says out of context in stories for print and television media .
Throughout the deposition , Arpaio comes across as a leader who prefers to delegate ample amounts of authority to high - ranking sheriff 's officials and media - relations staff members .
The bulk of Arpaio 's testimony in the deposition involved his public - speaking engagements , appearances in television shows on FOXNews and CNN and quotes related to the sheriff 's immigration - enforcement policy Arpaio gave members of the print media .
Bodney refers to statements
Arpaio made in those forums in an effort to paint a picture of a sheriff who is often inclined to pursue law - enforcement policies - whether it 's forcing inmates to wear pink underwear or making immigration a top priority - with an equal emphasis on how the practices will play out with the voting public as he has in the impact on crime .
" Is it possible that your reason for moving forward on this get - tough ( immigration ) policy is because it is popular or might become popular ? "
Bodney asks .
After an objection from Arpaio 's attorney about whether the question already was asked , Arpaio responds :
" I could say ' no ' with a straight ' no , ' but - maybe I should not say this , but I have been sheriff for 17 years .
I have been reelected 15 years without the illegal immigration problem , so I do n't do this for politics . "
Arpaio on Monday called the release of his deposition testimony a public - relations move from the plaintiffs .
He said he responded to questions truthfully , but did not elaborate when it was not required .
" In depositions , they 'll ask you questions 100 different ways and try to trick you , " Arpaio said .
" When you have 4,000 employees , and I have a philosophy to delegate , I do know what 's going on in general terms .
I do n't micro-manage . "

Experience real stories of real people who tried to curate a perfect narrative but instead found true peace in authentic identity .
When they were lonely and overwhelmed , radical love stepped into that raw place and offered hope .
Tony Blair personally briefed Britain 's ambassador in Baghdad , with Downing Street calling almost every day as tension grew between political demands at home and reality on the ground in Iraq , the Chilcot inquiry was told today .
" The politics here demanded instant results , " said Sir William Patey , who was ambassador in Baghdad from 2005 to 2006 .
He told the inquiry in London that the almost daily briefings from No 10 came throughout his time in Iraq .
" The first time I have ever had instructions as an ambassador directly from the prime minister was : help get a constitution that the Iraqis would vote positively for , the formation of a new government , create the conditions for the withdrawal of British troops , " Patey said .
" It was quite simple . "
He went on : " They were quite reasonable instructions , provided you realised that they were n't in my gift or solely in the gift of the British government .
There was a tension between the desire for instant results and the realities on the ground .
What you could achieve in the sort of timescales that London needed for political reasons – there was a disconnect " .
Referring to pressure from Downing Street to engage with the radical Shia cleric , Muqtada al Sadr , Patey said : " There was rarely a day went by when I did not have a phone call from No 10 , " he said .
" I was encouraged by No 10 to reach out to the Sadrists to give them the message that we felt they had a place in the political system . "
But Moqtada had refused to see him and every Sadrist he did see " seemed to lose their job very soon afterwards …
They were very reluctant to engage with us but we tried to engage with them . "
Patey added : " I think the level of ambition was probably higher than the ability to deliver .
What could be delivered on Powerpoint could not necessarily be delivered on Earth . "
There were tensions with the US over the timing and scale of a phased withdrawal of British troops from Basra after 2006 as UK military chiefs increasingly worried about their ability to operate in two countries - Iraq and Afghanistan - at the same time , the inquiry heard .
" We did not have the means to deliver on the objectives ( in Afghanistan ) , " said General Sir Nick Houghton , chief of joint operations at the time .
Houghton , tipped as a future chief of defence staff , told the inquiry that the number of British forces deployed in Afghanistan was inadequate and Britain was not in a position to pursue a policy of " strategic coherence " there .
Helicopters wanted by the British commander in Basra were sent to Afghanistan where they were also needed .
Houghton defended the withdrawal of British forces from central Basra in 2007 to their base at the airport , saying they had become the focus of violence in the city .
Simon McDonald , Gordon Brown 's foreign policy adviser since he became prime minister in 2007 , said the Americans had expressed concern at the speed of the planned drawdown of British forces in Iraq .
" We went a little bit more slowly because that was what our key strategic ally wanted from us , " he said .
Pressed by Sir Roderic Lyne , a member of the inquiry panel , about the benefits to Britain of taking part in the invasion of Iraq , McDonald said : " It reinforced our key strategic relationship with the US . "
It also meant Britain had a good relationship with Iraq , which was " potentially the richest country in the Middle East " .

Copenhagen is hoping cyclists will ensure the city has one of the most environmentally - friendly Christmas trees in the world this year .
Volunteers must use pedal power to produce enough electricity to make the hundreds of lights on the tree sparkle .
They have until 18 December to help power the tree , on City Hall Square , using this alternative fashion .
The event starts a week before the Danish capital hosts the UN Copenhagen Climate Summit .
' No power '
During the summit , organisers say the city hall square will be take on the name " Hopenhagen Live " and become a hub for environmental and cultural activity .
They hope this alternative means of lighting the large tree will prevent the regular nine tonnes of carbon dioxide from being produced .
Project manager Stephen Risguard said that a number of bikes are connected to a different section of the tree and if no - one used the cycles , then there would be no power to turn the lights on .
Pia Allerslev , the city 's mayor responsible for culture and sports , said the tree would be the " greenest " that had ever lit up the square .
The city has more than 350 km ( 217.48 miles ) of cycle lanes and a reputation for being " bicycle - friendly " .
Leaders of Britain , Germany , France , Spain , Australia , Japan , Indonesia and Brazil are all expected to attend the UN summit , from 7 to 18 December .
The Bush administration raised the terror alert level to “ high ” during the 2003 winter holidays on the basis of a fake claim that Al Qaeda was passing messages to agents through a secret code embedded in TV broadcasts , says an investigative report at Playboy magazine .
Aram Roston reports that Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge raised the terror alert level to high in December , 2003 , based on claims by Dennis Montgomery , the chief technology officer of Nevada - based eTreppid Technologies .
Montgomery said he had developed software that could crack secret messages being placed inside transmissions from Al - Jazeera , the Arabic satellite news channel .
ADVERTISEMENT
The alert level was raised despite serious objections by some individuals inside the CIA , who found the idea of “ secret messages ” inside TV signals both ridiculous and pointless .
Montgomery ’s secret code was never released ; attempts to recreate his results failed ; and to this day everything having to do with the secret code - breaking software is classified .
Roston reports :
Montgomery claimed he had found something sinister disguised in Al Jazeera ’s broadcast signal that had nothing to do with what was being said on the air : Hidden in the signal were secret bar codes that told terrorists the terms of their next mission , laying out the latitudes and longitudes of targets , sometimes even flight numbers and dates .
And he was the only man who had the technology to decrypt this code .
Back in Washington , few insiders in government knew where the intelligence was coming from .
Aside from Tenet and a select few , no one was told about eTreppid ’s Al Jazeera finds .
Even veteran intelligence operatives within the CIA could only wonder .
And when some experienced officers heard about it , they could n’t believe it .
One former counterterrorism official remembers the briefing : “ They found encoded location data for previous and future threat locations on these Al Jazeera tapes , ” he says .
“ It got so emotional .
We were fucking livid .
I was told to shut up .
I was saying , ‘ This is crazy .
This is embarrassing . ’
They claimed they were breaking the code , getting latitude and longitude , and Al Qaeda operatives were decoding it .
They were coming up with airports and everything , and we were just saying , ‘ You know , this is horseshit ! ’? ”
First , Montgomery never explained how he was finding and interpreting the bar codes .
How could one scientist find the codes when no one else could ?
More implausibly , the scheme required Al Jazeera ’s complicity .
At the very least , a technician at the network would have to inject the codes into video broadcasts , and every terrorist operative would need some sort of decoding device .
What would be the advantage of this method of transmission ?
The terror alert hike of December , 2003 , came with one of the starkest warnings the Bush administration ever issued about the possibility of a terrorist attack on the United States .
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge “ said the move was the result of a ‘ substantial increase ’ in the volume of intelligence pointing to ‘ near - term attacks that could either rival or exceed what we experienced on September 11 , ' ” CNN reported at the time .
Roston suggests the administration may have been willing to believe the story , despite its improbability , because of Al - Jazeera ’s image as being an anti-American news source that has at times received statements from Al Qaeda .

Al Jazeera was an inspired target since its pan-Arabic mission had been viewed with suspicion by those who saw an anti-American bias in the network ’s coverage .
In 2004 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld accused Al Jazeera of “ vicious , inaccurate and inexcusable ” reporting .
Roston reports that Montgomery was charged with fraud earlier this year for passing bad checks worth up to $ 1 million .
And , even though the CIA eventually determined that Montgomery ’s codes were fake , the Nevada businessman continues to do business with the US government , having signed a $ 3 million contract with the Air Force earlier this year .
Roston further suggests that profit was the motive behind Montgomery ’s scheme .

The pattern recognition , anomaly detection and compression work were nice , but it was the Al Jazeera stuff — the “ noise filtering ” — that had cash potential .
Even though the CIA had abandoned Montgomery in 2004 after determining the bar codes did n’t exist , he and eTreppid continued to try to sell it .
[ e Treppid CEO Warren ]
Trepp later told a judge in a federal lawsuit that he ’d asked the government for $ 100 million .
Montgomery has also cited that figure in sworn declarations — though he also claimed Trepp wanted $ 500 million for the “ decoding technology . ”
The report in Playboy adds to a growing body of evidence that terror alerts during the Bush administration were unreliable .
Earlier this year , controversy erupted over statements made by Ridge , the former Homeland Security chief , that the terror alerts authorized at the highest levels of the administration may have been “ politically motivated . ”

Ridge also told a Washington forum audience earlier this year that terror alerts were at times raised on the basis of flimsy evidence .
My post about reasons to use OpenGL instead of Direct3D got a much greater response than I expected , making the front page of Digg , Reddit , Slashdot , and even the OpenGL website !
The vast majority of reactions were positive , but there were a few Direct3D users who posted negative comments which I will address in this post .
It 's clear that I put in too many distractions from my main points , which are as follows :
By supporting OpenGL you reach a much larger desktop gaming audience , avoid getting locked into proprietary standards , and promote healthy API competition .
Even if Direct3D were easier to use and had a head start on features , these reasons would still be sufficient for me to support OpenGL .
Should everyone use OpenGL ?
No , if you are developing a console exclusive , or an XBox game with a cheap Windows port , then there is little reason to think about OpenGL .
However , if you 're developing a home computer game , or a console game with a serious home computer port , then OpenGL is the most logical starting point for your graphics abstraction layer .
This way you can start testing on as many platforms as possible from the very beginning -- a well - known best practice which enforces a high - quality cross- platform development path , ensuring that compatibility issues show up early and can be easily fixed .
The most common complaint about my article was from programmers who find Direct3D easier to use .
I personally find OpenGL to be easy to use , but I acknowledge that this is subjective and opinions vary on this topic , just like Vi vs. Emacs or Mac OS vs Windows .
It 's useless to debate opinions like this .
If we take a larger view , the core functionality of Direct3D and OpenGL are so similar that they are essentially identical , and the differences in the API should be irrelevant to any experienced programmer .
The most important differences are that one is an open standard , and the other proprietary , and that one works on every desktop platform , and the other does not .
Here are some more specific responses to comments from DirectX supporters : I 'm trying to get to all of them , so this will be long -- feel free to skip this if you 're not interested !
The large bold - face text shows comments on the last post , and the smaller text is my response .
DirectX has free debugging and optimization tools on Windows , like PIX and NVPerfHUD .
OpenGL has no tools !
On Mac OS X , we have a whole suite of free OpenGL tools including the profiler , driver monitor , and shader builder .
On Windows and Linux there is the NVIDIA PerfKit , as well as AMD's GPU PerfStudio and ShaderAnalyzer .
If anyone has used both sets of tools and is informed about how they compare , please post your experiences in the comments !
While PS3 has an OpenGL wrapper available , developers almost always use libGCM instead !
Same for Wii and GX .
The whole OpenGL vs. Direct3D debate is silly ; you should create an abstraction layer that supports all graphics APIs , and use whichever one works better on each platform !
But XBox uses DirectX !
If I use DirectX for Windows as well , I save a ton of time !
You 're right !
Sorry about that , in my research I was confused by Sony 's public statements that OpenGL ES was their standard API which must have been changed by the time it was released , or just been misreported .
The developers I 've heard from who work on high - performance graphics for PS3 say that they use libGCM because it's closer to the hardware , giving developers complete control of the PS3 hardware and avoiding the CPU overhead of a high - level API .
On the other hand , 360 developers all use the high - level Direct3D API , even though it has significant CPU overhead , because there is no alternative .
This is irrelevant to the question of whether OpenGL or Direct3D are inherently better ; it 's an example of the trade - off between low - level optimized code and high - level portable code .
That is definitely the ideal solution !
However , if you are aiming for a cross - platform release , it 's vital to start testing on all the target platforms from the very beginning .
The marginal cost of cross-platform ( non-console ) development is almost zero if you keep portability in mind from the start , but it 's famously difficult to port a finished project .
To enforce cross-platform development from the beginning , it often makes sense to start your abstraction layer with OpenGL so you can immediately and frequently test your program on all the desktop platforms , and add the other APIs as needed .
If you 're targeting cross- platform console development , switching between superficial graphics APIs is the least of your worries -- you will be spending much more time dealing with issues like memory management , multiprocessing , streaming from optical disks , optimizing for five - year - old hardware , and meeting vendor certification requirements .
In this mountain of work , switching from one API to another is a grain of sand .
On the other hand , the API does make up a significant part of your porting work when porting between identical hardware , such as Windows , Mac and Linux desktop computers .
It 's significant in this case just because the API is almost the only thing that has to be changed .
Supporting Mac and Linux is trivial if you make a habit of using cross-platform libraries like OpenGL , SDL and OpenAL from the start , but very difficult if you use proprietary libraries like Direct3D , DirectInput and XAudio .
OpenGL 3.0 sucked !
It was delayed drastically and did n't deliver on its promises !
OpenGL 3.0 was not the revolutionary upgrade that it was hyped to be , but it was still a substantial improvement .
OpenGL 3.1 and 3.2 addressed many of the concerns not addressed by 3.0 , and it looks like it's on track to keep improving !
If more game developers start using OpenGL again , the ARB will have more incentive and ability to keep improving OpenGL 's gaming features .
I hated DirectX 9 , but DirectX 10 is actually pretty good !
That 's great that it 's improving !
However , since less than half of Windows gamers can run DirectX 10 , you will need to write a DirectX 9 renderer anyway .
You freetard microsoft - haters can go choke on your tinfoil hats !!!!
OpenGL is dead like PS3 and Mac you n00 b hobbyists !!!
leave the graphics talk to the grown - ups and keep your mouth shut !!!
SERIOUS AAA DEVELOPERS LIKE ME HAVE REAL WORK AND DEADLINES AND NEED DIRECTX 12 RIGHT NOW !!!!
If you want to debate with me , please state your points and back them with evidence .
I have no agenda here besides sharing the truth as I see it and encouraging a healthy and open game development scene .
You 're just comparing OpenGL and Direct3D , not OpenGL and DirectX .
DirectX includes many other libraries , such as netcode , video , sound , and input .
This was true at one point .
But now almost all of the DirectX libraries have been deprecated .
Microsoft 's input and sound APIs are still around in the form of XInput / DirectInput and XAudio 2 .
However , you you can use them with OpenGL just as easily as you can use them with Direct3D , so they are not really relevant to the question of which graphics API to use .
If you would rather have a sound and input solution that 's cross-platform and open - source , I would recommend SDL and OpenAL .
Direct3D has built - in functions to load .dds textures and .x models !
I can't figure out how to load assets with OpenGL !
You can read and write standard image file formats using FreeImage , and read and write compressed formats using NVIDIA Texture Tools .
Most model formats have open specifications , and it 's straightforward to write a parser for them , or find source code to load them online .
If this kind of thing is really a factor in your choice of graphics APIs , then you would be better off starting with a pre-built game engine instead of writing your own .
Are you saying that AAA developers use DirectX just because they 're too stupid to see through Microsoft 's bullshot comparison ads ?
You 're the only one who 's smart enough to figure it out ?
No , of course not .
That kind of marketing primarily affects game developers via gamers .
Since gamers and game journalists are not graphics programmers , they believe Microsoft 's marketing .
Then , when the gaming press and public are all talking about DirectX , it starts to make rational short - term business sense for developers to use DirectX and ride Microsoft 's marketing wave , even if it does n't make sense for other reasons .
On the other hand , game developers are directly targeted by DirectX evangelists and OpenGL FUD campaigns .
At game developer conferences , the evangelists are paid to shake your hand and deliver painstakingly - crafted presentations and well - tested arguments about why your studio should use DirectX .
Since nobody does this for OpenGL , it can be hard to make a fully informed decision .
Also , not even the smartest developers could have known that the plans for dropping OpenGL support in Vista were false , or that the terrible Vista beta drivers were not representative of the real ones .
It does n't leave a bad taste in your mouth to be manipulated like this ?
It sure does for me .
Are these the only reasons why DirectX is so much more popular than OpenGL ?
No , but they 're a significant factors .
As I discussed at length in the previous post , there are many network effects which cause whichever API is more popular to keep becoming more popular , so small factors become very large in the long run .
D3D11 tesselation is not the same as the old ATI extension , it 's a whole new fixed - function pipeline including awesome hull and domain shaders !
At first I was skeptical for a few reasons .
First , the proposed tessellation pipeline achieves the same visible results as the older methods .
Second , the trend in graphics hardware is towards a more unified programmable pipeline ; adding more fixed - function stages seems like a step backwards , not forwards .
Third , ATI cards have had fixed - function tesselation for almost a decade now ( including the XBox 360 ) , and it was never really used .
However , now that both major vendors are planning to use the same tessellation pipeline , and are both adding dedicated tesselation hardware , it may start to become important in a few years when these graphics cards are widespread .
In this regard , OpenGL is lagging behind DX11 .
However , I would be very surprised if the OpenGL implementation is not ready long before these cards become popular .
Game developers use DirectX because the " big and fast " money is on the XBox .
Even Windows support is basically an afterthought , and Mac and Linux support are considered totally unimportant .
I had n't thought of it that way , but that 's a good point !
While it 's very difficult to port a PC game to XBox , it 's relatively easy to take an XBox game and make a cheap Windows port .
If this is all you care about , then it 's most efficient to just port the whole game from XBox to Windows using Direct3D 9 , and then make an even lower - quality port for Mac by wrapping the Windows version with Cider .
However , desktop gamers are pretty savvy .
They can tell when they 're being treated like second - class citizens , and will vote against low - quality ports with their wallets .
XNA is the easiest way for novice developers to make games .
I usually recommend that novice developers start by modding , because then you start with a fully - functioning game , and can make fun changes immediately .
If you want to transition from modding to making your own programs , I would recommend using Unity or Flixel instead of XNA .
They are free , cross-platform , and easy to share online .
I 've spoken to XNA developers who later regretted using it because they could have found their audience better on another platform , and porting from such a proprietary framework is very difficult .
I think that is all of the concerns I read in the comments -- please let me know if I 've missed yours !

ROANOKE , VA . —
Pulitzer - prize winning columnist Leonard Pitts told the jury this afternoon that his “ blood ran cold ” when he received an E - mail from white supremacist Bill White with his home address , telephone number and a reference to his wife .
When he clicked a link in the E-mail and saw that White had also published the information on the Internet , he realized it was now available to anyone who accessed White ’s website , including potentially violent extremists who share White ’s ideology .
“ It ’s terrifying because it makes you vulnerable in a way you have n’t been before , ” he said .
Pitts , who spoke with little emotion , spent nearly three hours on the stand during the second day of testimony at White ’s federal trial .
The former neo -Nazi leader is charged with threatening various people with whom he disagreed , including Pitts , a writer for The Miami Herald whose column is syndicated in some 250 newspapers .
White was infuriated by a June 3 Pitts column taking white supremacists to task for their propaganda about a black - on - white murder case .
Pitts said his ordeal began when the phone rang at his Bowie , Md. , home around 11 p.m. on June 3 , 2007 .
His wife answered .
Pitts , who was in bed , listened as she became increasingly agitated .
It was White , who identified himself as leader of a neo -Nazi group and insisted on speaking to Pitts about a column he ’d written .
She told him not to call again and finally hung up on him .
The next day , Pitts saw that he ’d gotten an E - mail from White with the subject line “ N----- Pitts . ”
The E-mail , filled with racial slurs , gave Pitts ’ contact information and told readers that “ his wife gets very upset when you call . ”
White had published the same information on his now - defunct website , Overthrow.com .
A few days later , David Wilson , an editor at the Herald , E- mailed White with a request to remove Pitts ’ personal information .
White refused .
In a reply that he copied to a neo - Nazi Yahoo ! group and posted on Overthrow.com , White wrote : “ Frankly , if some loony took the info and killed him , I would n’t shed a tear .
That also goes for your whole news room . ”
Pitts began getting hate mail and telephone calls at home .
One package arrived from White .
After deciding it did n’t appear to contain a bomb , Pitts marked it “ return to sender ” and stuck it back in the mailbox .
But the FBI disagreed and descended , along with a bomb squad and a haz - mat team , on Pitts ’ quiet neighborhood .
The family — including Pitts ’ wife , who was ill with sepsis , a blood disease — waited outside their home while the package was opened .
In it were two magazines from White ’s neo -Nazi group , the American National Socialist Workers Party .
At that point , Pitts testified , “ I feel like I ’ve been violated , and I feel like the sanctity of my home has been invaded — and there ’s a lot of anger and a lot of concern .
The concern is that this will lead to violence , to bloodshed . ”
On June 8 , 2007 , threatening E-mails arrived in the inboxes of Pitts and Herald editor Wilson , who testified this morning .
One E-mail to Wilson asked Pitts if he had life insurance because “ we do n’t want your little ones to go hungry in case something happens to you . ”
Another , sent directly to Pitts , said the columnist would soon receive a visit from the Aryan Brotherhood , a violent , racist prison gang .
It also included Pitts ’ personal information , clearly copied from Overthrow.com .
By the following night , the Miami Herald had arranged for Pitts to have 24 - hour , armed security guards at his home — the first time in Wilson ’s 33 years at the Herald that the newspaper had done so for a journalist in the United States .
Pitts ’ daughter , now a 19 - year - old college student , recalled her father telling her about the postings .
Instead of just dropping her off at school that day , he got out of the car to alert her principal to the situation .
During her second period history class , Ongel Pitts sat down at a computer as a few classmates looked on .
“ I googled ‘N----- Pitts ’ to see what was going on because my parents would n’t tell me anything , ” she said .
The search took her to Overthrow.com .
During cross-examination , defense lawyer David Damico portrayed Pitts as a liberal columnist who ’d benefited financially and professionally from his own provocative commentary .
“ Is it safe to say that Mr. Pitts is no shrinking violet in the rough and tumble of political discourse ? ” he asked Wilson at one point .
Damico noted that Pitts previously had been called racial slurs by angry readers and played a recording of a voicemail left at the Herald in which a man said Pitts ought to be lynched from a lamppost .
He got Wilson and Pitts to acknowledge that many other readers besides
White had taken issue with Pitts ’ June 3 column , which criticized extremists for using the brutal murder of a white couple in Tennessee to claim that black - on - white hate crimes are underreported by the media .
Damico also pointed out that most of the information
White posted was available on the Internet , including Pitts ’ date of birth and his wife ’s name .
Alex Linder , who runs Vanguard News Network ( VNN ) , a neo -Nazi Web forum , testified very briefly via video conference .
The government asked Linder to confirm that usernames and passwords connected to White were from VNN ’s database .
Not only was Linder a witness at the trial , but he ’s also publishing commentary about it :
His forum includes a lengthy discussion about the case .
Ca n’t make this stuff up .

If there ever were doubts about whether the public has opinions about the news , the arrival of online reader comments has dispelled them .
They do , and they are n’t afraid to post them online , usually anonymously .
Sometimes those views are insightful , but sometimes they ’re insensitive and occasionally they ’re downright offensive .
How should media outlets manage this new forum and where should they draw the line on what ’s allowed ?
A group of experts will discuss the brave new world that is “ story comments ”
… and the first panelist is …
Kurt Greenbaum , assistant city editor and online editor at the St. Louis Post - Dispatch , where he has worked since 2002 .
Kurt ’s been involved in online journalism since 1996 and has been a reporter and editor at the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale and dbusiness.com , an online business news start - up .
Greenbaum also recently tripped , face first , in to a giant pile of internet shit when he got a man let go from his job after violating his own site ’s privacy policy to track down a commenter that said a naughty word in the comments of a childish post .
And then this happened .
And this .
This too .
Oh and do n’t forget this .
Frankly if the panel invited because of his recent issues as a “ what not to ever do ” this would be fantastic , but it appears that ’s not that case which means we could have even more people pulling Greenbaums in the future .
Maybe you should stick to just commenting on here .
I promise I wo n’t get you in to trouble at work .
Trust me , I ’ve been there .
Steorn , developers of free - energy gadget called Orbo , have managed to survive for six years without having successfully demonstrated the technology in public .
It must be some kind of record .
But yesterday , an Orbo was installed at the Waterways Ireland Visitor Centre , and you can see a live video stream of the Orbo chugging away .
According to Steorn CEO Sean McCarthy , the Orbo is able to " gain energy from magnets with no apparent source . "
Here 's more about it , from Steorn 's " What is Orbo Technology " page :
Orbo is a technology that creates energy from magnetic interactions .
Orbo provides free , clean and constant energy at the point of use .
Orbo is a platform technology that can be engineered to power anything from a phone , to a fridge to a car .
Orbo technology is controversial – science tells us that energy can not be created – yet Orbo does this .
Orbo is an over unity technology – it provides more energy out than is put in .
Orbo is a result of many man years of technological development using a " Victorian Science " approach .
It is a technology that has been derived phenomologically , through test , implementation and retest .
Three cheers for " Victorian Science , " but I do n't believe the Orbo can make more energy than it uses .
It sure is fun following Steorn 's attempts to achieve the impossible , though .
If any Boing Boing readers in Dublin have witness the live demo , please share your thoughts in the comments .
UPDATE : the blog called Steorn 's Orbo has a good post about why this demo is useless :
Orbo 2009 is similar in its basic design , but the outer ring of magnets are now electromagnets rather than permanent magnets , and these electromagnets are fed by a battery .
That battery , it is claimed , is constantly recharged by a small electrical generator attached to the spinning Orbo .
The net result , says Sean McCarthy , is that the Orbo produces some three times the energy it uses .
The energy that is n't cycled back to the battery is dissipated as heat .
Sean 's claim may be true – the Orbo may be generating three times the energy it is using , right in front of our eyes .
Or , it may not be ; there 's no way to tell without being an experienced engineer and hooking the rig up to a lot of complex testing equipment .
Because there 's a battery in the loop , there 's just no telling how much energy , if any , Orbo is actually generating .
So Steorn may have what they claim .
Or they may be lying about it as part of a scam .
Or they may honestly believe they have it , but be wrong .
There 's still no way to tell .
In other words , this Orbo sounds like it's a plain old motor .

Calcutta is galloping towards the 10 - degree mark with the Celsius on Sunday dipping to a decade ’s December low of 11.4 degrees .
The minimum temperature touching three degrees below normal , the weatherman was eyeing the coveted cold reading “ within 48 hours ” .
An official of the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) in Delhi said : “ It looked a little uncertain on Saturday , but Sunday ’s further fall seems to have sealed the deal , with the minimum temperature likely to be around 10 degrees Celsius by Wednesday .
It could turn out to be the coldest Calcutta winter ever . ”

A man suspected of attempting to break in to a supermarket in a Portuguese town became stuck with his trousers down for 11 hours .
The alleged thief was trapped halfway through a small window in the supermarket in Almancil and as he tried to free himself his trousers fell off .
Once freed , the man was taken into police custody .
Fun :
When Brian mentioned the sale on Learning Perl and Mastering Perl , I went and purchased two of each .
Presumably one for me and one for my girlfriend .
I have n't read mine but instead gave it to my younger brother who decided to learn Perl .
I 've been helping him almost daily with the material and the homework .
Yesterday I presented him the idea of tests and showed him Test :: More .
You see , until now he 's been manually running each exercise in the book and comparing the output with what the book says it should be .
Instead he can now write what the book expects it to be as a test and run the code , then just see if it's " ok " or " not ok " .
Much simpler .
He likes it very much .
Profit :
Today I had to propagate MySQL optimizations to a rather long list of servers .
The problem is that each of these servers has specific replication - related preferences such as the server_id .
Patching wo n't help because there are possible ( which is admin -speak for " definite " ) differences between the files , they are of different versions and so on .
Instead of going over every file and trying to push the changes in manually , I wrote a script that goes over the my.cnf , extracts the personal variables , puts them in a file and then adds an ! include in the my.cnf to read that file .
However , I 'm very cautious at $ work ( or I like to think I am ) , and things are very volatile here so I wrote 32 tests ( spanning across 4 files ) that the script runs in various stages along the change .
This assures me that before the script dissects the files I have a backup of the my.cnf somewhere , I know I have the correct variables I want to extract and that they are enabled and activated , etc. etc .
Basically making sure there are no surprises .
All in all , this is a serious time saver because I do n't have to go server by server manually and check things or make the changes themselves .
The tests are run , I see the result and I press [ enter ] to authorize the script running .
Beautiful !

In the struggle for equality between the sexes , it keeps coming down to motherhood , does n’t it ?
Consider a recent article by Hanna Rosin in The Atlantic .
Rosin finds that nursing her infant is holding her back from the work she enjoys , despite her plan for a fully egalitarian marriage .
“ We were raised to expect that co-parenting was an attainable goal , ” she laments , yet breast - feeding ties her , and not her husband , to their baby .
She combs through research on the health benefits of breast - feeding for babies and makes a convincing case that they are n’t as strong as experts have insisted .
So does she quit nursing ?
She does not — even though , she admits , “ I ’m not really sure why . ”
Rosin is a thoughtful writer , which makes her bewilderment all the more puzzling .
She is , after all , a mammal , a member of a species that evolved mammary glands ; does n’t it seem likely that this might have some impact on her experience of life ?
Of course , she is hardly alone in avoiding this conclusion .
Evolutionary science has been nearly as vexing a subject for feminists as for rural Texas school boards .
Feminists consider sexual identity a “ social construct , ” a human — or , to be more precise , a male — invention .
Evolutionary scientists , on the other hand , believe that we have inborn physical and psychological traits that result from millennia of adaptations to our natural environment .
Where feminists see society , evolutionists see nature .
Especially galling to feminists has been the field of evolutionary psychology , which proposes that evolution has fundamentally shaped human sexual and reproductive behavior — behavior that often seems to conform to the worst stereotypes .
So New York Times science writer Natalie Angier refers to evolutionary explanations of why older men prefer younger women as “ just so stories ” told by “ evo-psychos . ”
Recently in Newsweek , Sharon Begley critiqued evolutionary psychology –inspired apologias for poor behavior by the likes of John Edwards and Eliot Spitzer before gladly pronouncing the field dead as a dinosaur .
Begley is right that pop evolutionary psychology often bears about the same relation to science as an episode of The Flintstones does to the Pleistocene era .
But she ’s wrong about the field ’s being on its way out .
If anything , recent findings in primatology , neuroscience , and genetics have given evo-psych new life .
Scientists in these fields , many of them women , have lent support to some deeply controversial ideas about differences between the sexes .
Among the most troubling for women like Rosin is that their inner conflict between child rearing and independence may be a battle between two powerful evolutionary forces .
If there ’s one part of evolutionary thinking that spells bad news for the feminist worldview , it is parental - investment theory , an idea originally proposed by Harvard professor Robert Trivers .
Trivers was attempting to clarify Darwin ’s theory of sexual selection , which went something like this : females of most species are more particular about their mates than males are .
That means males must compete for female attention ; hence the colorful tails of peacocks and the lovely songs of many male birds .
But why should females be pickier than males ?
In 1972 , Trivers offered an answer .
He observed that in just about every species , it ’s the females that gestate the young .
When an animal nurses its offspring , as is the case with mammals , that ’s part of the female job description , too .
It is also mostly females who feed and guard the kids .
In fact , females do nearly everything that increases the survival , and eventual reproductive success , of their offspring .
Trivers concluded , logically enough , that as the sex with so much more at stake in gestating and feeding , females would take a stronger interest in their young .
Females , as he put it , “ invest ” more than males — and that includes being cautious about their sexual partners , the fathers of their offspring .
Scientists , including the large number of female experts who have entered the field over the past 35 years , have had plenty of time to prod Trivers ’s parental - investment theory for weaknesses .
They ’ve found a few .
For one thing , females do n’t always act as invested in their offspring as Trivers ’s theory says that they should be .
In conditions of extreme scarcity , for instance , mothers abandon or even kill their infants .
Biologist Marlene Zuk has also noted that monkeys deprived of maternal care show little interest in their young .
For another , males are sometimes big investors .
In Why Sex Matters , the zoologist Bobbi Low cites a number of species , including the notorious praying mantis , whose males not only invest but make the final sacrifice .
After mating , the female bites the male ’s head off .
( Researchers maintain that ’s only if she is hungry . )
It ’s also the case that high - investing females are sometimes promiscuous , though in accordance with Trivers ’s general thesis , only when it benefits their young .
One of Trivers ’s students , the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy , discovered that female Hanuman langurs of India will mate with a large number of outside males .
Male langurs often enter the troop and kill nursing infants , evidently hoping that the now - childless females will be available to mate with them .
By “ sleeping around , ” a female langur engages in what is effectively a clever counterstrategy .
She raises nature ’s equivalent of self - conscious doubt in aggressive males — What if this is my baby , carrying my genes ?— making them less likely to kill the kids .
As a theory , parental investment is more than an addendum to Darwin ’s original sexual selection .
Parental — which almost always means maternal — investment governs mating and reproduction .
The profound female connection to her offspring is the Rosetta stone of female sexual behavior .
Evolutionary scientists disagree on some details of sexual selection , but for all its uncomfortable implications , parental investment has been largely free of dissenters .
Just about all scientists have signed on to Trivers ’s basic template that in nature , females almost always do the kids .
The notion that females are more highly invested in their children than males is being confirmed by findings in biochemistry and neuroscience , as these disciplines clarify the role of hormones — particularly testosterone and oxytocin — in sexual and reproductive behavior .
Like the male sex hormone testosterone , oxytocin is produced in the hypothalamus .
But in most other respects , it is the anti-testosterone .
Instead of fueling aggression , it promotes attachment , reduces fear , and leads to feelings of pleasure and well - being .
Testosterone appears in males at far higher levels than in females ; oxytocin , on the other hand , is more prevalent in females .
Women have many more oxytocin receptors in their brains than men do , and those receptors rev up during orgasm , childbirth , and breast - feeding — signaling that at a biological level , the boundaries most of us take as axiomatic between sexual pleasure , reproduction , and mothering are not all that clear .
Hrdy goes so far as to conclude that “ the ‘ afterglow ’ from climax is an ancient ‘ maternal ’ rather than sexual response . ”
In females , in other words , the maternal urge shapes the sexual urge .
Oxytocin may explain what Katie Roiphe , a journalism professor at New York University , meant when , in a recent essay , she described an “ addiction ” to her newborn baby that left her indifferent to work .
Many female readers were perturbed : Roiphe was feeding the cult of motherhood , they said ; maternal love is neither an interesting nor a useful subject for women today .
But surely it ’s worth understanding the natural forces at work in our everyday experience .
Evolutionary psychology tells us that our neural systems evolved in ways that enhanced survival .
Maternal attachment was essential to that project , since babies without mothers were at much higher risk of death .
Evolution selected for women like Roiphe and Rosin who wanted to hold and nurse their infants .
Since women with more oxytocin receptors were most successful at reproducing , they tended to pass down the genes that ensured the same hormonal sensitivity in their offspring .
Conversely , for survival , infants needed to attach to their mothers ; not surprisingly , oxytocin is transmitted to babies in breast milk .
( Researchers are pursuing evidence that autistics , who have trouble attaching emotionally to others , are abnormally low in oxytocin . )
There may or may not be a “ maternal instinct ” — like many female academics , Hrdy objects to the term — but there is a hormone that amounts to almost the same thing .
It inclines females to feed , cuddle , and fuss over their young , and leaves men at peace .
If that were evolutionary psychology ’s whole story about women , then its experts would be proclaiming patriarchy as our destiny , which they do n’t tend to do .
In fact , as neuroscientists and geneticists piece together the human brain ’s evolution , it ’s becoming clear that , if it ’s natural for a woman to go crazy over her babies , it ’s also natural for a woman to run the State Department .
The same human female brain that ’s primed with oxytocin is , like the male brain , a fantastically complex machine , capable of reasoning , innovative problem solving , and maneuvering through hugely varied social environments — whether the PTA , a corporate headquarters , or Congress .
Human beings are called Homo sapiens for good reason .
We evolved brains proportionately bigger than any other animal ’s , and when it comes to the gray stuff , size matters .
The human cranial space is taken up by a large , densely wired frontal cortex , which allows us to create sentences and paragraphs , think abstractly , and plan for tomorrow ’s meeting or next year ’s vacation , all cognitive activities far beyond the capacity of any animal .
The cortex is also the driver for human culture .
When you ponder a picture of the Taj Mahal or attend a production of A Midsummer Night ’s Dream , thank the evolution of the human brain .
In a related way , the frontal cortex gives humans , unlike animals , the potential to control urges from the limbic system , whether for the second piece of red velvet cake or for the brunette behind the Starbucks counter .
Next time you go to the zoo , look at the chimp ’s low , recessed brow .
Then check out your own bulging pate .
That , clever reader , is your frontal cortex .
The frontal cortex is the reason that sexual selection does not provide the rigid behavioral script for humans that it does for animals .
The chimpanzee brain gives the mating male and reproducing female no choice about how to go about the business .
It ’s humans who have invented everything from love marriages to purdah , from bordellos to nunneries .
Evolutionary psychologists are sometimes accused of not giving proper due to the flexibility of the human brain .
In her recent book Mothers and Others , for instance , Hrdy argues that just as animal males do n’t tend to their infants , so human fathers ca n’t be expected to hang around for the long run .
But at their best , scientists are apt to describe the brain as chemically and neurologically predisposed to certain behaviors — nurturing babies in the case of women , for instance — while capable of adapting these behaviors to enormously varied environments .
Sometimes those environments even change the brain ’s chemistry , a process that the writer Matt Ridley calls “ nature via nurture . ”
When Hrdy presumes the fecklessness of men , she underestimates the environmental pressure of social norms .
The human record suggests that social norms , especially the universal one of marriage , can reinforce fathers ’ ties to their children , which in turn might even become part of the male neural architecture .
Recently , neuroscientists have even discovered evidence that married men ’s testosterone levels fall at the birth of their baby .
Similarly , females adapt to complex societies that put a premium on abstract thinking and organizational skills .
But they can do so only when the environmental conditions are right , as in the developed world today .
Once again , we can thank Mother Nature — or , more precisely , the frontal cortex .
Using our noggins , human beings have transformed the environment in which they mate and reproduce , expanding opportunities for females to employ their three pounds of brain muscle .
Most people would point to the invention of the birth - control pill as one of the key moments in the cultural transformation that culminated in this contemporary ecosystem .
But other human inventions were vital as well .
Two recent papers by economists tell some of the story .
In one , a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research , Stefania Albanesi and Claudia Olivetti show how child care was only one of the reasons women were once limited to the home ; illness and injury caused by childbirth closed doors , too .
“ Consider a typical woman born around 1900 , ” the authors write .
“ She married at 21 and gave birth to more than three live children between age 23 and 33 .
The high fetal mortality rate implied an even greater number of pregnancies , so that she would be pregnant for 36 percent of this time .
Health risks in connection to pregnancy and childbirth were severe .
Septicemia , toxaemia , hemorrhages and obstructed labor could lead to prolonged physical disability and , in the extreme , death . ”
It was n’t just the Pill , then ; antibiotics , blood banks , improvements in prenatal and obstetric care , and the mass production of safe baby formula fundamentally altered the human environment in ways that laid the foundation for contemporary women ’s achievement .
Machinery invented by the brainy Homo sapiens also revolutionized the female lot .
Until 1900 , the vast majority of people in the Western world lived in conditions much like those in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Middle East today .
Few had access to electricity ; only about a quarter of all American households had running water .
In this environment , American women did what women tied to their domiciles with three - plus children have always done : cooking , making and cleaning clothes , hauling water , and the like .
But by the mid-twentieth century , human innovation had considerably lightened those essential household tasks .
Using U.S. Census data , University of Montreal economist Emanuela Cardia has shown how home technology , including appliances and bathroom plumbing , played a significant role in moving women into the labor force .
And so in the twentieth century , the big - brained female — Femina sapiens , if you will — found herself living in an utterly reshaped habitat , free from sepsis , unplanned children , sewing , bread baking , and arduous trips to the well .
She was ready to use her brain in new ways , not coincidentally at a time when the intellectually gratifying jobs of an advanced economy were becoming more plentiful .
It ’s a neat coincidence that women wrote both of the papers just discussed .
Men invented the antibiotic and the washing machine ; today , women in economics departments calculate the benefits of these discoveries for their sex .
Better yet , they themselves can make future discoveries in labs and R&D departments .
( Whether their cognitive makeup makes them less inclined to take up such scientific tasks remains a matter of intense disagreement among scientists . )
In a 2007 paper , economists Justin Wolfers and Betsy Stevenson noted that young women attach greater importance than in the past to “ being successful in my line of work , ” “ being able to find steady work , ” “ making a contribution to society , ” and “ being a leader in my community . ”
Given both their neural architecture and the new cultural ecology , you could hardly call this unnatural .
But you could call it problematic , as new mothers like Rosin and Roiphe are rediscovering .
The contemporary woman is in a bind .
Her brain ( crudely put , her hypothalamus ) is at war with her brain ( equally crudely , her frontal cortex ) .
She wants two things at once , and they are often contradictory .
Complicating her life further , the frontal cortex of her own children will take forever — some say over 20 years — to develop fully .
That means that she faces many more years with dependent offspring than females of other species who ca n’t write briefs or paint canvases , yet have nothing else to do with their time .
It ’s unfair !
And here ’s another bitter pill for women : more complex societies like our own require a more highly developed frontal cortex .
To thrive in today ’s complex economy , children have to undergo many years of intensive training .
The final irony for Femina sapiens is that she may well find herself sacrificing some potential achievements to raise the child who goes on to invent a device that makes life richer for future generations of women .
If human society can sometimes reconfigure biology — by curing polio and increasing athletic stamina , for example — could it reconfigure sexual selection so that fathers and mothers made equal investments in their young children ?
We do n’t have much evidence for thinking so .
Until the mid-1990s , Swedish parents got nine months of leave after the birth of a child , and in theory , either mothers or fathers could use it ; in practice , it might as well have been called maternal leave .
Frustrated that so few fathers took advantage of the policy , the Swedish government changed the way it worked : fathers would now get a month of leave ( or two , as of 2002 ) that they were n’t allowed to transfer to their wives .
The results were just as evolutionary psychologists would predict .
By 2004 , only 20 percent of fathers were taking the two months .
By contrast , a large majority of mothers made full use of their leave .
Iceland launched a similar effort to equalize parental investment ; fathers there are doing more , but nowhere near as much as mothers .
The predicament of Femina sapiens poses immense practical challenges that should be a subject of public debate .
How do we make it easier for working women who want more time to invest in their young children to work part time , or to return to their jobs after an extended leave ?
What is the proper role of government in all this ?
Meantime , though , it might help if women understood their predicament philosophically .
Since its beginnings , many people have objected to evolutionary theory as reductive and dismissive of humanity ’s special place in the cosmos .
I see it rather differently .
Like his near - contemporary Freud , Darwin shows us to be profoundly mysterious to ourselves .
We humans live on many levels : some are unique to us , but others connect us to our primordial ancestors and , indeed , to the natural world itself .
“ Taking care of the baby — physical , draining , exhilarating — is more like farming , ” writes Roiphe , “ following the rhythms of the earth , getting up at dawn , watching the corn flush in the sunrise .
It is not at all like writing . ”
There is something thrilling in the mystery and embeddedness of this experience .
“ There is a grandeur in this view of life , ” Darwin wrote in a sentence much quoted during this , his 200th anniversary year .
“ From so simple a beginning the endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been , and are being evolved . ”
And so , too , Femina sapiens .
On Tuesday the Los Angeles City Council finally passed its long - awaited ordinance regulating medical marijuana dispensaries .
For something that was in the works for almost five years , it sounds like a surprisingly slapdash effort .
In a city that has somewhere between 500 and 1,000 dispensaries ( depending on whose estimate you accept ) , the new ordinance imposes a " cap " of 70 , but not really :
The Los Angeles Times notes that it " makes an exception for those that registered with the city clerk in 2007 [ when the city imposed an unenforced and widely ignored moratorium ] and remain in their original locations or moved just once , " and " city officials believe there are about 150 such dispensaries . "
Then again , the ordinance 's highly restrictive location rules , which apply to existing as well as future operations , may ultimately determine the total number of dispensaries .
They can not be within 1,000 feet of each other or of various " sensitive uses , " which include schools , parks , libraries , and places of worship .
Worse , " in a last - minute addition , the City Council also restricted them from operating adjacent to or across a street or alley from residential properties . "
That requirement " eliminates most commercial streets , such as Melrose Avenue and Pico and Ventura boulevards , where alleys separate stores from homes . "
The upshot , according to dispensary operators , is that they will have few location options outside of industrial zones .
It seems the council members , like the legislators who decree drug - free , gun-free , and sex - offender - free zones , could not be bothered to consult a map and figure out the practical implications of these arbitrary rules .
Not only are they inviting litigation ; they are blithely interfering with the lives of patients who use marijuana to relieve the symptoms of serious illnesses ( and who under the new ordinance will have to pick one dispensary and stick with it ) .
Why should they have to trek out to an industrial area to get their medicine ?
For that matter , why should they have to wait until 10 a.m. or be deprived of a refill because they arrive after 8 p.m. , just because those are the opening and closing times arbitrarily dictated by the city ?
The council would never dream of imposing such restrictions on pharmacies .
For that matter , strip clubs and sex shops are more accessible than the dispensaries will be under these rules .
Leaving aside the absurd conceit that the city council can somehow determine the " right " number of dispensaries , the burden on patients is hard to justify in light of state laws that recognize their right to use marijuana as a medicine .
To the extent that neighbors have legitimate complaints about noise or other spillover effects from dispensaries , they can be addressed without this kind of hamhanded crackdown .
Meanwhile , City Attorney Carmen Trutanich continues to maintain that selling medical marijuana is illegal , which would make all of the dispensaries criminal enterprises .
Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley takes a similar view and plans to keep prosecuting dispensary operators .
Brian Doherty noted the imminence of the ordinance last week .

Europeans are shaking their heads over their American friends again .
Whether talking to people in the street , in the cafés or to journalists or political leaders , everyone here asks me the same question : Has America lost its mind ?
Town halls filled with angry citizens , shouting at their elected leaders , some of them armed with guns and threatening signs ?
Besides the media spectacle of these neo -1776 revolutionaries , what is doubly perplexing to Europeans is the focus of the protests : healthcare .
What 's strange to a European is that everyone here already has healthcare .
The place that Donald Rumsdfeld once sneeringly called " old Europe " long ago solved this dilemma , producing quality healthcare for a fraction of the price that Americans pay .
Many Europeans are astonished when they find out that 47 million Americans – larger than the populations of most European nations – do n't have any healthcare at all except a hospital emergency room .
Contrary to stereotype , most of Europe does n't use single payer , with France , Germany and others having evolved a " third way " that combines individual choice with private , nonprofit insurance companies and Medicare - like cost controls .
Even countries like Croatia , Hungary and Slovenia , with per capita incomes only a fraction of that in the United States , have healthcare for all their people .
Europeans simply do n't understand how a wealthy United States could remain the last advanced nation that does not have universal healthcare .
Lounging one evening in one of Budapest 's elegant thermal baths larger than an Olympic swimming pool , with Europeans of all ages and nationalities soaking their limbs in relaxed leisure , I was treated to a dose of the common wisdom that is taking hold here .
Introducing myself as an American evinced a swift reaction from one sweating sauna companion :
" I do n't understand you Americans .
You blow billions on a useless war in Afghanistan and Iraq , and billions more to bail out banks that nearly bankrupted the world economy , but you do n't ensure healthcare for your own people .
Even Obama can't make a difference .
It 's as if your democracy does n't work anymore . "
He was Austrian but spoke in a near - perfect English that was as good grammatically as that spoken by some of my relatives .
And his reaction was typical .
As Europeans watch the United States flailing about over something as basic as healthcare , they are reminded once again of the impotent US response following Hurricane Katrina .
TV images of stranded , poor , black people in New Orleans have been melded to those of this new healthcare insurgency with pitch forks , leaving an indelible impression .
The last remaining superpower is not looking so super anymore , whether in Iraq , Afghanistan , healthcare , the economy – not anywhere .
The global economic collapse , largely blamed on out - of - control Wall Street capitalism , is stinging here as well , though in most regions Europe has not suffered as much as America has .
In my informal polling of small business and shop owners , they said the downtown had hurt , but only a little bit .
Since the crisis , Europe has employed clever strategies – some of them since copied by the Obama administration , such as the popular " cash for clunkers " auto rebate programme – that have prevented it from suffering the doubling of unemployment that the US is enduring .
Indeed , Europe , once looked down upon by American pundits as the land of double - digit unemployment , currently has lower unemployment than the United States .
Contrary to Europe 's reputation as having a sick , sclerotic economy , its per capita economic growth rate actually was slightly higher than America 's in the 10 years leading up to the economic crisis .
Still , a number of people fear that the worst is yet to come .
And so Europeans appear both angry and perplexed by America 's deregulated capitalism run amok , which has further served to undermine the American brand .
As one Slovenian acquaintance , a representative of a consortium of small businesses said to me : " The US used to lecture us in Europe about just about everything , but what does America have to teach now ?
Maybe America should learn something from Europe . "
Indeed , with Germany and France becoming the first major western economies to emerge from recession into positive growth , perhaps the US should learn something from our transatlantic cousins .
But what might we learn ?
Here 's a clue , say some Europeans .
German chancellor Angela Merkel once was asked by then - British prime minister Tony Blair what the secret was of her country 's economic success , which includes being the world 's largest exporter nation and running substantial trade surpluses .
She famously replied : " Mr Blair , we still make things . "
Werner Abelshauser , an economic historian at the University of Bielefeld in Germany , says the European way of running the economy " is fundamentally about firms that emphasise high - quality products and long - term relationships between suppliers and customers " .
Company managers set long - term policies , while market pressures for short - term profits are held in check .
Gunter Verheugen , vice - president of the European Commission , echoed the virtues of Europe 's strong , competitive industrial base , succinctly stating Europe 's recipe for success : " Do n't try to be cheaper .
Try to be better . "
But in the United States , for decades under the sway of the Reagan revolution 's economic philosophy , which favoured corporate finance over manufacturing , the economy has seen a stark decline in manufacturing .
Since the second world war , the financial sector in the United States has tripled in size as a percentage of the overall economy and of corporate profits .
That increase accelerated during the eight years of the Bush administration , even as the US lost 5.5 million manufacturing jobs .
European capitalism for the most part did n't succumb to the financialisation that swept the United States in the 1980s , and which paved the way for the speculative bubbles that have now caused economic collapses in both 2001 and in 2008 ( with notable exceptions in Britain , Spain and Ireland , similarly plagued by a collapsed housing bubble ) .
So from the other side of the pond , the city on the hill is looking pretty average these days .
America is still a leader , but not the leader .
That 's a post - post - cold war concept that the world is still getting used to , and that Americans do n't want to admit .
But the evidence is everywhere , and especially obvious when you step outside the American bubble .
As one Viennese politician told me : " If the American model no longer is the blueprint for the world , what comes next ? "
Some Europeans think they have the answer , and much of the world is paying attention , even if most Americans still are not .

Yesterday morning as I settled onto my elliptical at the gym , I anxiously turned to the television silently playing captioned CNN .
It was before sunrise , and I knew it would be a good thirty minutes before daylight would reveal the devastation the 7.0 earthquake had unleashed on Haiti .
The man on the neighboring machine , also watching the television , turned to me and said , “ You know they killed all the white people after they gained independence … it is that Vodou … they deserve it . ”
I pedaled along speechless , not sure what shocked me more , that this man would think these things or that he felt comfortable enough with his hatred that he was fairly confident I would agree .
I ignored him and I wish I had not .
What I wanted to say is that Vodou is not some sort of sorcery , or the product of some “ pact to the devil ” ( thank you Pat Robertson ) .
I also wanted to correct his erroneous assumption that Haiti is a nation of Vodou practitioners .
It is , and continues to be , overwhelmingly Christian .
I confess that I have been fairly glued to CNN in the past twenty - four hours , and two things have struck me as I watched the constant onslaught of images of suffering and destruction .
The first is the erroneous fact that CNN keeps claiming on its ticker that Haiti is 80 % Roman Catholic .
The second is the sheer amount of U.S. missionaries on the island .
The two are inter-related .
Recent studies estimate that the Protestant population of Haiti is somewhere around thirty percent .
In Port - au - Prince that number jumps to almost forty percent .
The majority of these churches are Pentecostal .
These churches are overwhelmingly independent , indigenous Haitian entities , though some are linked to North American denominational Pentecostal churches .
Haiti , along with Jamaica and Puerto Rico , is home to one of the fastest growing Pentecostal populations in the Caribbean .
As I watch the drama unfold in Haiti , and feel it here in Miami , the home of the largest Haitian Diaspora in the United States , I cannot help but think of another earthquake , another country .
In 1976 a 7.5 earthquake devastated Guatemala , leaving 23,000 dead and over 50,000 injured .
My husband , a child at the time , has told me of the silence , the fear that followed this catastrophe .
As a scholar of religion , I have often wondered of the theological impact of this natural disaster .
Thankfully , the scholarship of Virginia Garrard - Burnett provides some answers .
She correlates the explosion of Pentecostalism in Guatemala , who like Haiti , is an epicenter of Pentecostalism in the Americas , in part as a response to the earthquake .
An overwhelmingly high percentage of Guatemalans saw the earthquake as a form of divine punishment and a call for repentance .
Arriving in the guise of aid and relief , Protestantism provided an alternative way of being Christian .
Yet Pentecostalism primarily emerged in Guatemala , as it did in Haiti , disconnected from North American denominations .
Indigenous Pentecostalism , with its apocalyptic theology , also gained momentum among Indigenous Guatemalans .
Haiti had barely recovered from the four devastating storms of 2008 prior to this earthquake .
The Roman Catholic Cathedral in Port - au - Prince has collapsed , and Archbishop of Port - au - Prince , Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot ’s lifeless body was pulled from the ruins of the diocesan offices .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has described the natural disasters that this nation has endured as “ biblical ” in nature .
“ It is biblical , the tragedy that continues to stalk Haiti and the Haitian people . ”
Clinton does not realize that her comments would strike a chord with many Haitians today .
Haitian Pentecostals , with their biblical literalism and their certainty that the second coming of Jesus is imminent , could see this time of tribulation as a challenge where the faithful will be rewarded on judgment day .
Religion will surely play a role in the manner in which Haitians make sense of this tragedy , and I suspect we will find growing numbers of Pentecostal converts as Haitians attempt to find meaning in what can only be described as senseless and inexplicable suffering .
( Mental Floss ) --
We 've all seen it : that one lonely bag on the baggage claim track at the airport that goes around and around with no owner in sight .
What happens to it if no one shows up ?
Well , it might end up at the Unclaimed Baggage Center in Scottsboro , Alabama .
That 's where you can visit a store that takes up an entire city block and find everything from the expected ( clothing , toiletries , books ) to , well , the unexpected .
Here are 10 of the strangest items that have gone unclaimed .
1. Hoggle from " Labyrinth " -- Unlike other items at the Unclaimed Baggage Center , Hoggle is not for sale .
He is now a permanent part of the Unclaimed Baggage Center Museum .
If you 're not familiar , Hoggle was David Bowie 's dwarf - goblin minion in the 1986 movie .
2 . A slew of ancient Egyptian artifacts -- From a mummified falcon to a shrunken head , a bunch of objects dating back to 1500 B.C. were found in an old Gucci suitcase .
Christie 's auction house ended up selling the museum - worthy items in the ' 80s .
3 . A rattle snake -- A live one , roaming free amongst the rest of the unclaimed baggage .
4. A Naval guidance system -- Yep -- a piece of equipment worth $ 250,000 was lost and never claimed .
The people at the Center decided to be good sports and return the expensive GPS to the Navy .
Mental Floss : The Mojave Desert 's airplane graveyard
5. Bountiful Barbie ( but not in the way you think ) --
A woman purchased a Barbie at the Center for her daughter , which is n't at all unusual .
After all , kids lose toys all the time .
But when the girl yanked the head off her new Barbie , $ 500 in rolled bills tumbled out of her body .
6 . A full suit of armor -- Unlike the Egyptian artifacts , this guy was merely a replica of a 19th century piece .
Still , I bet to this day , there 's a guy out there who continues to tell the story of the time he lost a suit of armor at the airport .
7 . A violin from the 1770s -- Like Hoggle , it resides in the Unclaimed Baggage Center Museum .

What 10 movie props later sold for
8. A 5.8 - carat diamond --
It was set in a platinum ring and packed in a sock .
9 . A camera designed for use on a NASA Space Shuttle --
As with the Navy 's guidance system , the Center dutifully returned the camera to NASA .
10 . A 40.95 - carat natural emerald .

What you eat is n't the only determinant of your overall health status .
There are plenty of other facets of your life that play major roles in determining how functional and energetic you are .
Here 's how I think about the role that diet plays in contributing to health and disease :
If you 're consistently eating foods that nourish your cells and do n't create cellular injury or inflammation , your diet can take a back seat to other high priority items , like getting enough rest , being physically active , being in a healthy environment , and spending time with people and projects that leave you feeling fulfilled .
If you 're not eating the right foods for your health - foods that are injuring your cells and creating inflammation in your body with or without your awareness - then your diet deserves the bulk of your attention and resources , as taking care of other areas of your life while continuously crippling your body with your food choices is a recipe for chronic disease .
Figuring out what to eat to support your best health is a project that you best take on yourself , as no one else can observe all of the ways in which your body responds to the foods and beverages that you consume .
Put another way , it 's virtually impossible for one specific dietary program to best support everyone because we 're all unique in countless ways and we 're always changing .
What is possible and effective for many is to follow a few specific principles that govern healthy eating , to continuously be mindful of how you 're feeling , and to make modifications whenever necessary .
Sometimes , modifications may be called for immediately , as in the case of discovering a food allergy .
At other times , you may find that changing life circumstances - like aging or even changing of seasons - require alterations to your diet to keep you feeling strong and healthy .
What follows are general principles of healthy eating that I personally strive to follow and that I recommend to my clients .
1. Eat Nutrient - Rich Foods .
Nutrient - rich foods are naturally abundant in one or more of the following health - promoting nutrients :
Healthy protein
Healthy fat ( including cholesterol )
Healthy carbohydrates ( including fiber )
Vitamins
Minerals
Enzymes
Water
Phytonutrients ( health - promoting nutrients found in plant foods )
Dark or brightly colored vegetables , fruits , and legumes are generally considered to be nature 's most nutrient - rich plant foods that are typically well tolerated by the masses .
From the animal kingdom , eggs from healthfully raised birds and cold - water fish are good nutrient - rich food choices for many people .
Broths made from vegetables and / or bones from cold water fish or healthfully raised chickens are also deeply nourishing choices .
2. Minimize Or Avoid Consumption of Highly Processed Foods .
Foods that are predominantly made of sugar , flour , and highly processed grains ( found in many commercially prepared cereals ) are generally low in nutrient value .
Ditto for the vast majority of deep - fried foods like donuts and potato chips .
You may be able to indulge in highly processed foods without experiencing significant consequences to your health in the short term if your health is relatively good , but the more you stay away from this group of foods , the healthier you will be and feel in the short and long term .
3. Minimize or Avoid Consumption of Foods that Cause Cellular Injury or Inflammation .
Based on everything that I know about human health and nutrition , the worst offenders are :
Pasteurized and homogenized dairy products .
Foods that contain shortening or partially hydrogenated oils .
Most varieties of highly processed luncheon meats , hot dogs , bacon , and sausages .
Factory - farmed flesh meats that have been cooked to a crisp .
4. Chew Your Foods Well .
Chewing your foods until liquid takes burden off your digestive organs , and allows your body to maximally extract and absorb nutrients in the foods that you eat .
You are n't what you eat ; you 're what you fully digest , and thoroughly chewing your foods is an essential requirement for optimal digestion and health .
***
In sharing the principles noted above with clients , I 'm often asked to provide examples of what I eat on a day - to - day basis .
Here 's a look at what I typically eat during colder months :
Breakfast :
Some type of fruit - usually pomegranates , apples , or clementines
Lightly scrambled organic eggs - scrambled in coconut or extra-virgin olive oil
Drink made by blending almond milk , frozen banana slices , and an organic whole food multi powder .
Lunch :
Bowl of soup , usually miso , seaweed , or Chinese radish
Bowl of rice
Kim Chi
Filet of fish ( just once in a while , usually salmon , sardines , or mackerel )
Dinner :
Soup
Pinto beans or chickpeas ( usually in the form of hummus )
Rice with a number of vegetable side dishes , similar to bi bim bap , a Korean dish of rice and vegetables .
The foods listed above are typical fare for our family of four , though my wife and two sons tend to have more animal protein than I do ; they all do well eating small amounts of free - range chicken and turkey , and occasionally even beef , but any animal protein that they eat is accompanied by generous portions of vegetables and mineral - rich soup , as well as some rice .
As a family , we also enjoy the recipes that I publish in our healthy recipes archive .
For example , we 'll occasionally treat ourselves to some pancakes along with fresh fruit for breakfast .
Sometimes , we 'll have vegetarian chili for dinner .
We 're big on avocados and guacamole all the time .
Given that our family is pretty active , we tend to eat healthy snacks at least once a day .
These snacks include smoothies and various vegetables , nuts , and seeds .
We almost always have a big bin of baby organic greens in our refrigerator - we add handfuls to most of our soups .
I also like to munch on a bowl of raw greens while I work , as I find that this helps keep my teeth strong .
After playing tennis or doing any other type of exercise , I typically make another drink for myself with a variety of superfood powders - the same kind that I have in the morning .
We regularly make our own vegetable or chicken broth to have on hand for the soups we make .
I do a lot more juicing in the summers than in the winters .
But even during colder months , I like to juice up a couple of heads of romaine lettuce once in a while and drink the whole batch within a few hours .
Like munching on raw baby greens , drinking freshly pressed lettuce juice makes my teeth feel strong , and I also find that this practice makes it possible to participate in strenuous activities for hours at a time without feeling muscle fatigue or cramping .
In the summer , we eat many of the same foods mentioned above , but we tend to eat mostly raw foods , especially during the hottest months .
From about June to September , the four of us go through at least one whole watermelon a day - I 'm talking about 15 - pound melons .
Also in the summer , I find that I prefer to eat less whole grains and more steamed vegetables , along with generous servings of a wide variety of raw vegetables .
Enough about what me and my family eat .
If you 're looking for guidance on what to eat to get and stay healthy , I encourage you to consider the four principles mentioned above , to follow your instincts in trying foods and recipes that are appealing , to observe how you feel while eating different foods , and to make modifications whenever necessary .

Ever wonder who decides how many Gummy Bears = 1 serving ?
( 18 ) Or that one cup of Wheaties = 1 serving ?
Well , nationwide food consumption surveys do , but also the NHLBI ( National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ) .
So if you 're wondering why a serving of ice cream is usually only a Â½-cup ( on their Web site the NHLBI says no more than the size of half a baseball ) , it 's because that 's what they 've determined is the right amount to stay healthy .
Meanwhile , we all know how many baseballs Baskin Robbins scoops into their hot fudge sundaes -- enough to fill a small bathtub , right ?
The NHLBI has studied portion explosion over the last 20 years and has done a lot of groundbreaking research .
The good folks over at DivineCaroline.com used that research , re-purposed some NHLBI photos from a fun portion explosion quiz , and tell us that " in the 1970s , around 47 percent of Americans were overweight or obese ; now 66 percent of us are .
In addition , the number of just obese people has doubled , from 15 percent of our population to 30 percent . " 
Scary stuff , right ?
This all starts to make a lot of sense when you look at the following images , culled from the NHLBI site and DivineCaroline.com .
Clearly the majority of us are eating more than 18 Gummy Bears .

Nick Griffin , the leader of the British National party , is to represent the European parliament at the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen , which opens next week .
Last night politicians and scientists reacted furiously to news that the far - right politician and climate change denier should be attending the summit on behalf of the EU .
Griffin , who was elected to the European parliament in June , confirmed last night that he would attend as the representative of the parliament 's environmental committee .
World leaders , including Barack Obama and Gordon Brown , are hoping to forge a new global agreement to curtail greenhouse gas emissions .
Without such a deal , scientists warn that world temperatures will increase by more than 2C by the end of the century , triggering ice cap melting , sea - level rises , widespread flooding , the spread of deserts and devastating storms .
In a speech in the parliament last week , Griffin denounced those who warn of the consequences of climate change as " cranks " .
He said they had reached " an Orwellian consensus " that was " based not on scientific agreement , but on bullying , censorship and fraudulent statistics " .
" The anti-western intellectual cranks of the left suffered a collective breakdown when communism collapsed .
Climate change is their new theology …
But the heretics will have a voice in Copenhagen and the truth will out .
Climate change is being used to impose an anti-human utopia as deadly as anything conceived by Stalin or Mao . "
Griffin will be one of 15 representatives chosen to speak on behalf of the EU in Copenhagen .
The shadow climate change secretary , Greg Clark , condemned the move last night .
" It is utterly ridiculous that someone who does n't even believe in climate change should be seeking to represent Europe in Copenhagen .
The BNP does not command the support of the people of Britain , let alone of the rest of Europe , " he said .
A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said : " Membership of the European parliament 's delegation to Copenhagen is a matter for the European parliament .
Its delegates do not represent the UK government or its views .
Nick Griffin will not be part of the UK delegation . "
Tim Yeo , chairman of the Commons environmental audit committee , said the decision to choose Griffin showed the " bizarre way " the parliament operated .
He added : " If the future prosperity of the human race , in the face of climate change , depends on the contributions of people like Nick Griffin , there is little hope for any of us . "
Professor Alan Thorpe , chief executive of the Natural Environment Research Council , said Griffin 's claim that thousands of scientists dispute the existence of man-made global warming was simply not true .
" The intergovernmental panel on climate change draws on the views of most of the world 's leading climate scientists and they have been quite clear that the evidence shows , with a high degree of certainty , that human activities are now having a substantial effect on the climate .
It is simply not the case that there is a substantial number who do not accept a link . "
Bob Ward , of Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment , said : " Griffin denies the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change .
This appears to be driven by a dogmatic strand of right - wing ideology that opposes any form of environmental regulation , usually hidden behind the dishonest claim that climate change is a left - wing conspiracy . "
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman and a former MEP , said the European parliament always divided up positions on such delegations according to the parliament 's political balance .
" Griffin was bound to get something at some stage .
It is just a shame they did n't send him to Iceland instead . "
Critics say Griffin addresses environmental issues when he believes he can use them to advance anti-immigration policies .
His party claims that it would improve Britain 's transport infrastructure and reduce carbon dioxide levels by reducing the number of immigrants in Britain using roads , cars , trains and buses .
Gerry Gable , publisher of the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight , said Griffin once tried to win over environmentalists in the 1980s .
" His core beliefs – that the white race is being threatened by an invading minority – are the so - called principles that have run through his nasty career . "

If you believe that humanity is marching ever upward , moving closer to perfection , 2009 was your year .
Scam artists grew ever more sophisticated in 2009 , moving away from spam emails and fast - talking telemarketers towards a more " corporate " image .
As in so many other fields of endeavor , we can thank the Web for introducing new efficiencies into the business of separating ususpecting consumers from their money .
A credible - looking Web site and a few inexpensive Internet ads are all it takes to get started in the theft - by - net business .
This year , our annual review of the Top 10 Scams finds more fast - buck artists functioning like legitimate businesses .
The old tried - and - true scams -- advance - fee loans , phony lotteries , " free " cruises -- have by no means disappeared but in 2009 , clever marketers added a few new twists .

Who wouldnt want a brighter smile , especially if it were cheap and easy ?
Or maybe a miracle vitamin supplement .
Or a thoroughly cleaned - out colon ?
These are just some of the questionable products shady operators have used to lure consumers into handing over their credit card information .
One common pitch is for a " free " trial - sized bottle of teeth whitener .
The consumer provides credit card information to pay a $ 2 fee for shipping .
That seems like a reasonable request in order to get a free sample , right ?
Wrong .
Once these people have your credit card information , they can -- and do -- put all kinds of charges on it , claiming the consumer signed up for a membership club or committed to buying a case of the stuff .
Chances are theres something buried in fine print that obligates you but regardless , you 're stuck with trying to get the charge taken off your card .
Geraldine of Dawsonville , Ga. , thought she was ordering a trial of Resveratrol for $ 1.95 but ended up with a full bottle of the stuff ( or at least a full bottle of stuff claiming to be Resveratrol ) and no information .
Soon after that , another full - size bottle arrived .
When she called her credit card company , she made an awful discovery .
" In addition to the $ 1.95 , which had been billed and paid , there were two new unauthorized charges , " she told ConsumerAffairs.com .
" There was one charge for $ 87.62 on 11/4 by Improved Health , and another charge made on 11/11 for $ 87.62 by Youth Supp .
Each charge had a different toll - free number . "
Geraldine said she was told that she was on an auto - ship program and every 30 days the company would ship a bottle of the supposed heart - healthy goop to the tune of $ 87.62 each .
" She said I had 15 days to return the first bottle if I did n't want to stay in the program , " Geraldine said .
" None of this was communicated on the website where I ordered the sample .
She asked if I read the terms and conditions , but I saw nothing there with terms and conditions .
I realized immediately that I 've been scammed . "
Unauthorized charges put on credit cards by scammers is nothing new -- it 's been going on for years .
But it may have finally reached the point where people in positions of power are taking notice .
In December , Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) sent letters to credit card companies asking them to come up with ways to curb aggressive online sales tactics .
In another hopeful sign , Google changed its advertising policy to ban the advertisers instead of the ads .
In the past , when Google banned a URL , the advertiser would just create a new URL , shilling the same products .
Now , the advertiser is banned and put on notice that it is no longer allowed to sell anything through Google 's ad systems .

2. Mortgage Modifications and Foreclosure " Rescues "
copyright Many scams depend on desperation to hook victims and perhaps nothing drives people to despair faster than the prospect of losing their home to foreclosure .
The continuing recession in the housing market has produced a plague of loan modification and foreclosure rescue scams .
In March , California police arrested two women on fraud charges .
California Attorney General Jerry Brown said they " coldly and heartlessly " conned over 160 victims out of thousands of dollars for non-existent loan modification services .
" These scam artists coldly and heartlessly preyed on Californians desperate for help in saving their homes , " Brown said .
" Homeowners in financial trouble have to be on guard against loan modification fraud , so they do n't make a bad situation worse . "
The scammers charged desperate homeowners a large , up - front fee and told them not to contact their lender .
In these scams , operators promise to either arrange for loan medications or save it from foreclosure .
They never do , however , and the homeowner loses their home .
The Obama Administration joined with a number of states during the year to bring charges against companies and individuals accused of fleecing homeowners with phony schemes to save their homes from foreclosure .
" We 're enforcing the law against these scam artists , " said Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Chairman Jon Leibowitz .
" We 're putting others on notice that unless they change their ways , they 're next ; and we 're working with other government agencies , non-profits , and mortgage companies to reach out to our neighbors in distress with the details of how to get help . "

3. Debt Settlement
copyright
If consumers are on the brink of losing their homes to foreclosure , chances are they are also drowning in debt and prime targets for the debt settlement scam .
The number of companies claiming they can settle consumers ' debts for pennies on the dollar proliferated in the last year , leaving many victims poorer and deeper in debt .
At the end of the year the attorneys general of 40 states asked the FTC to tighten regulation of companies offering debt relief services to consumers .
The FTC is currently reviewing a new rule proposal to amend the current Telemarketing Sales Rule .
The move follows a number of individual actions by various states .
In October , Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued Credit Solutions of America and its CEO , Douglas Van Arsdale .
The Attorney General 's complaint alleges that the company falsely claims that its services can help to reduce consumers ' credit card debt by 50 percent .
Madigan 's lawsuit contends the company continually fails to negotiate with consumers ' creditors even though consumers cease to pay their creditors directly and , instead , make months of upfront payments to CSA .
As a result of CSA 's failure to take any effective debt settlement action on behalf of consumers , according to Madigan 's lawsuit , creditors frequently sue consumers to collect on the outstanding balances .
Madigan said her office has seen a sharp rise in debt - and credit - related consumer complaints .
Over the last few years , her office has received more than 12,000 complaints regarding debt and credit issues .

4. Government Stimulus
copyright
In February , Congress passed and President Obama signed a $ 700 billion stimulus bill , a massive infusion of federal spending that is designed to stimulate the economy .
Almost immediately there appeared Internet ads with the president 's smiling face , promising consumers they could cash in and get a share of the loot .
Millions of spam emails went out , promising the same thing .
Of course , it was a scam .
If you clicked on the ad or on an email link , you were asked for bank account information so that the operators could deposit consumers ' share of the stimulus directly into their bank account .
Instead , the scammers drained consumers ' accounts of money and disappeared .
A bogus e-mail may appear to be from government agencies and ask for information to " verify " that you qualify for a payment .
The scammers use that information to commit identity theft .
Some e-mail scams do n't ask for information , but provide links to find out how to qualify for funds .
By clicking on the links , consumers have downloaded malicious software or spyware that can be used to make them a victim of identity theft .
" Web sites may advertise that they can help you get money from the stimulus fund .
Many use deceptive names or images of President Obama and Vice - President Biden to suggest they are legitimate .
They 're not , " said Eileen Harrington , Acting Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection .
" Do n't fall for it .
If you do , you 'll get scammed . "

5. Acai Berry
copyright The Acai Berry Scam is testament to the Oprah Effect .
When the Queen of Talk expresses interest in a subject , it creates major buzz .
So when Oprah devoted several of her shows to the powers of the acai berry to help control weight , scammers went into overdrive .
While Oprah 's enthusiasm was limited to the berry itself , it wasnt long before Internet ads where hawking the benefits of acai berry " supplements , " promising all sorts of dubious health benefits .
At least one company offered a small bottle for $ 4.95 , just to get the consumers credit card information .
" I ordered AcaiPure from an ad on the Internet and on August 5 , 2009 , they billed my account $ 4.95 as agreed , " Nancy , of La Mesa , Calif. , told ConsumerAffairs.com .
" Then on August 19 , 2009 they billed me an additional $ 59.95 without my permission . "
With Oprahs picture plastered all over the supplement ads , Winfrey and her company filed trademark infringement suits against 40 Internet marketers of acai berry supplements .
For good measure , Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued three companies -- Advanced Wellness Research , Crush LLC and Amirouche & Norton , LLC -- over their business practices .

6. Work - At - Home Schemes
copyright Rising unemployment this year prompted many people to grasp at work - at - home schemes in hopes of producing an income or getting rid of a stressful commute .
While the brochures and Web sites made the prospect sound very easy and appealing , it seldom turned out that way .
Bogus work - at - home job offers almost always require the " employee " to deposit checks , money orders , or accept funds wired into his or her own personal bank account or credit card account , then keep a commission and wire the balance somewhere else , often to places outside of the United States .
Some victims of these scams have also been asked to process packages or perform certain tasks , such as stuffing envelopes .
" Whether the task is stuffing envelopes or forwarding checks , the net result is the same for the consumer , who almost always ends up losing a lot of money and getting a lot of trouble for their effort , " said Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel .
In addition to work - at - home jobs , hucksters also pushed work - at - home " business opportunities , " which often required victims to put up thousands of dollars to participate .
In August , a Florida convicted the president of one of the nation 's largest home - based business opportunity schemes , Global Resources .
Federal prosecutors say the company fleeced investors to the tune of more than $ 4 million .
Global promoted business opportunities to consumers across the country through television commercials and other media , touting the profits that could be earned by purchasing a Global distributorship , and urging consumers to call a telephone number that appeared in the ads .
Potential purchasers were told that for a purchase price of approximately $ 15,000 , Global would provide three terminals , numerous prepaid cell phones , and advertising material , and that potential purchasers would earn their investment back in approximately six months to a year .
None did .

7. Kevin Trudeau
copyright Marketer Kevin Trudeau is always selling something , and in 2009 , it was his book " Debt Cures They Dont Want You To Know About " , his follow - up to " Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About . "
Some who bought the book claim it has almost no usable information that can't be easily gleaned from other , free sources .
But the overwhelming majority who have written to ConsumerAffairs.com complain about the aggressive sales tactics they encounter when buying the book over the phone .
" I bought a Kevin Trudeau book from TV , " Paula , of Susanville , Calif . , said .
" I am unemployed .
He , and his group , keep sneaking $ 7 - $ 40 charges on my unemployment debit card .
I can't even figure where some of the charges are coming from .
The phone numbers are not good , or are never answered !
I have no grocery money now because of $ 70 in the last month ! "
The book costs $ 29.95 but Tom , of Butte , Mont. , complains the shipping charges amounted to $ 33 .
He got off easy .
Jacqueline , of York Springs , Pa. , said she called to order the book but by the time she got off the phone had been charged $ 152.85 .

8. Online Car Sales
copyright Online car sales continue to grow and so , unfortunately , do online car sales scams .
These scams work two ways , with scammers posing as both buyer or seller .
As buyer , the scammer will send a cashier 's check for much more than the sale price , telling the victim to cash it , take out enough to cover transportation costs , then wire the balance back to the " buyer . "
The cashier 's check is fake , but by the time the bank discovers that , the victim has send several thousand dollars to the scammer .
In a new wrinkle in the online car sales scam , the FBI reports scam artists are now posing as members of the United States military in a new ruse to dupe consumers buying vehicles on the Internet .
These scammers claim they 've either been sent overseas to improve military relations or need to sell their vehicles quickly and cheaply because of upcoming deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan , FBI officials say .
" Victims find attractively priced vehicles advertised at different Internet classified ad sites , " the agency warns .
" Most of the scams include some type of third - party vehicle protection program to ensure a safe transaction . "
After consumers receive what the FBI calls " convincing e-mails from the phony vehicle protection program , " they are told to send either the full payment , or a percentage of the payment , to the third - party agent using a wire payment service .
" No vehicles are delivered to the victims , " the FBI said .
Consumers can protect themselves from getting taken in one of these schemes by doing their homework before buying any vehicles on the Internet , the FBI said .
Consumers should also know and follow the rules used by the Internet sites they visit .
If someone asks you to break those rules , the FBI warns , that person is likely trying to rip you off .

9. Auto Warranties
copyright Many scams target seniors and one of 2009's most senior - targeted scheme was the auto warranty scam .
Scammers used telemarketers and direct mail to warn seniors the warranty on their automobile was about to expire , but for a small fee , it could be extended .
" Not only are these telemarketers lying about the consumer 's coverage , they are potentially ignoring federal laws such as the Do - Not - Call registry , " the Better Business Bureau warned in February .
Also in February , North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper obtained a court order against Automotive Protection of New Jersey and its manager Christopher Doyle .
The order requires the defendants to stop illegally telemarketing North Carolinians and to quit taking their money .
ConsumerAffairs.com has received numerous complaints about the companies pushing these warranties , including Automotive Warranty Services , Inc .
" I purchased a 3 - year extended warranty on my car over the phone from a call from this company .
I put $ 2700 on my discover card and have nor received a policy or any information as to coverage , Nancy , of Clarksville , Tenn. , told ConsumerAffairs.com .
" I have made numerous attempts to cancel but they say it can't be done because I signed a paper I received in the mail and had to send back so I have nothing to show for my money . "
In May a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order stopping telemarketing company Voice Touch , Inc. , from making any further auto warranty sales calls in violation of the Do Not Call Registry and other provisions of the Telemarketing Sales Rule and the FTC Act .
The move follows charges by the FTC that the defendants were operating a massive telemarketing scheme that used random , recorded phone calls to deceive consumers into thinking that their vehicles warranty is about to expire .

10 . Bank Failure Email
copyright
In many ways , 2009 was the year of the bank failure , as more than 100 banks failed in the first 11 months of the year .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) was so busy closing banks that some email scammers tried to ride its coattails .
By mid-year consumers were finding emails in their inboxes that appeared to be from the FDIC , warning them that their bank had failed and they needed to enter their bank account information to make sure they were insured .
If was , of course , a phishing scam , and quit a few people fell for it before FDIC and the FBI began issuing warnings .
FDIC said it never sends out emails asking for sensitive information .
In fact , if any email asks you to enter account numbers , user names or passwords , you can be assured its a scam .
So many scams , so little time
There were plenty of other dangerous scams that did n't make our list this year , but are worth a warning .
Ponzi schemes remained a consumer threat in 2009 , mainly for investors .
Following last year 's revelation of the Bernie Madoff scandal , several states brought charges against brokers and investment advisors for running Ponzi schemes in which investors lost money .
Some of these schemes raked in millions of dollars , and though not as massive as the Madoff scam , left many people with huge losses nonetheless .
Phishing scams also remained a threat with spam email , telemarketers and even cell phone text messages attempting to trick consumers into revealing sensitive financial information .
Scammers even attempted to steal from the dead in 2009 .
In addition to a highly celebrated case in Chicago , a Grand Rapids , Mich. , cemetery operator pleaded guilty to two felonies for embezzling more than $ 4.2 million in cemetery trust funds from Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens in Grand Rapids , and failing to properly administer numerous funeral contracts over a three year period .
" Stealing from the dead is a betrayal of the highest order , " said Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox , who brought the case .

What to do
How can you avoid becoming a scam victim in 2010 ?
We recommend keeping an eye on emerging scams through our Scam Alert section , and our daily and weekly newsletters .
And remember -- if it sounds too good to be true , it almost always is .
" In several of the emails , climate researchers discussed how to arrange for favorable reviewers for papers they planned to publish in scientific journals .
At the same time , climate researchers at times appeared to pressure scientific journals not to publish research by other scientists whose findings they disagreed with . "
...
" More recent exchanges centered on requests by independent climate researchers for access to data used by British scientists for some of their papers .
The hacked folder is labeled " FOIA , " a reference to the Freedom of Information Act requests made by other scientists for access to raw data used to reach conclusions about global temperatures .
Many of the email exchanges discussed ways to decline such requests for information , on the grounds that the data was confidential or was intellectual property .
In other email exchanges related to the FOIA requests , some U.K. researchers asked foreign scientists to delete all emails related to their work for the upcoming IPCC summary .
In others , they discussed boycotting scientific journals that require them to make their data public . "
The other
I was reminded of the verse by Humbert Wolfe ( of whom I know nothing else — I encountered it in something written by George Orwell ) .
The other story was from the BBC , currently my first source for online news .
It discussed the successful hacking — and said nothing at all about what was found .
I was reminded of the verse by Humbert Wolfe ( of whom I know nothing else — I encountered it in something written by George Orwell ) .
" There is no way to bribe or twist
Thank God the British Journalist .
But seeing what the man will do
Unbribed , there 's no occasion to "
------------------------------
A few more quotes
( added to the post later )
I noticed a few more quotes , this time from the Washington Post , and wondered how those defending the emails in comments here would react to them :
In one e-mail , the center ’s director , Phil Jones , writes Pennsylvania State University ’s Michael E. Mann and questions whether the work of academics that question the link between human activities and global warming deserve to make it into the prestigious IPCC report , which represents the global consensus view on climate science .
“ I ca n’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report , ” Jones writes .
“ Kevin and I will keep them out somehow — even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is ! ”
In another , Jones and Mann discuss how they can pressure an academic journal not to accept the work of climate skeptics with whom they disagree .
“ Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to , or cite papers in , this journal , ” Mann writes .
. . .
Is pressuring a journal not to accept work you disapprove of by getting colleagues not to cite papers published in that journal a legitimate tactic ?
------------------------------A few more quotes ( added to the post later )
I was recently struck by the contrast between two news stories on the same event , the publication of thousands of emails and documents from a climate research group in Britain , obtained by hacking into their computers .
The Wall Street Journal story described the contents of what had been taken and published to the internet :
The Climategate crowd successfully worked to obscure the connection between solar activity and climate .
The leaked CRU e-mails reveal how .
In 2003 , two Harvard - Smithsonian Professors , Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas , published a peer - reviewed paper in the scientific journal Climate Research which identified solar activity as a major influence on Earth 's climate .
This paper also concluded that the twentieth century was not the warmest , nor was it the century with the most extreme weather over the past thousand years .
These two scientists reviewed more than two hundred sources of data .
The paper specifically examined climate variations observed to coincide with solar variations .
One of the more notable correlations cited in this paper is the well - documented coincidence of the Little Ice Age and a solar quiet period from A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1900 .
Soon and Baliunas asserted that the lack of solar activity resulted in cooler temperatures across the globe .
The evidence they compiled also indicated that as the sun became more active global temperatures began to rise and the Little Ice Age ended .
In the past , the issue of the solar connection has always fallen down on one question ; what is it about sunspots that cause a change in the climate ?
Soon and Baliunas identified the physical connection as solar wind , which varies on an eleven - year cycle similar to sunspots ' .
The solar wind is made up of high - energy particulate radiation and when strong enough , it has a visible effect upon the atmosphere in the form of auroral displays in the polar regions ( e.g. , the Northern Lights ) .
Some instances of solar wind were so powerful that the aurora was seen even in lower latitude , as happened during the Battle of Fredericksburg , Virginia during the War Between the States ( Civil War ) .
Both armies were so distracted by the intensity of the display that the battle actually paused as the soldiers , North and South , watched in awe .
With such convincing evidence , the Soon and Baliunas paper became the target of a great deal of criticism from the gang led by the now - discredited Dr. Jones of the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) at East Anglia University in Britain .
The recently uncovered e-mails from him and his collaborators show an orchestrated effort to discredit the work of these two scholars .
What is also notable is that Soon 's and Baliunas 's references were the very same data that the Jones Gang had reviewed and suppressed .
The data in question is known as proxy data .
Proxy data is data compiled from tree rings , sediments , and ice cores , as well as other indirectly measured estimates of temperature .
Correlating an accurate timeline for these data sets across the globe is supremely difficult , but these proxy data sources were beginning to indicate a cycle or signal which might expedite the process .
This signal was thought by some in the Jones Gang to be a solar cycle .
The discussion of solar influences is brought up in an e-mail from Dr. Daly , dated 9 August 1996 .
Dr. Daly uncovered an eleven - year signal in the temperature data set from the island of Tasmania .
He found this signal by using a mathematical signal analysis formula known as a Fourier Transform .
It is clear from the tone of his e-mail that he knows this is not welcome news , but he goes on to state the following concerning the temperature data set compiled by the Jones Gang :
( I tried the same run [ Fourier Transform ] on the CRU global temperature set .
Even though CRU must be highly smoothed by the time all the averages are worked out , the 11 - year pulse is still there , albeit about half the size of Sydneys ) .
The eleven - year cycle corresponds exactly with the one observed on the sun .
This fact was kept secret by the Jones Gang .
Correlating the timeline of these proxy data was identified as problematic by Dr. Wigley , another member of the Jones Gang , in an e-mail dated 12 Aug 1996 .
In his effort to correlate the data , Dr. Wigley concludes that the solar signal is strong enough to convince him that solar forcing is a major factor in climate change :
(4) Causes .
Here , ice cores are more valuable ( CO2 , CH4 and volcanic aerosol changes ) .
But the main external candidate is solar , and more work is required to improve the " paleo " solar forcing record and to understand how the climate system responds both globally and regionally to solar forcing .
What is significant about this paragraph is that it identifies the main cause of climate change as " solar forcing , " not carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) .
This fact was also kept secret .
Remarkably , this was exactly what Soon and Baliunas published in their Climate Research paper .
The solar correlation became a lightning rod .
More than a dozen e-mails from the Jones Gang discuss how to discredit Soon and Baliunas .
Ultimately , the gang decide to compile a new paper to counter the conclusion made by Soon and Baliunas , as detailed in an e-mail from Dr. Scott Rutherford dated the 12 March 2003 .
Dr. Rutherford does not go head - to - head with the data presented in the Climate Research paper , but he seemingly wishes to " cook " other data to counter the honest work of Soon and Baliunas , as stated by the following :
First , I 'd be willing to handle the data and the plotting / mapping .
Second , regarding Mike 's suggestions , if we use different reference periods for the reconstructions and the models we need to be extremely careful about the differences .
Not having seen what this will look like , I suggest that we start with the same instrumental reference period for both ( 1xxx xxxx xxxx ) .
If you are willing to send me your series please send the raw ( i.e. unfiltered ) series .
That way I can treat them all the same .
We can then decide how we want to display the results .
Dr. Rutherford goes on to suggest that Soon and Baliunas should be dealt with severely :
... there is nothing we can do about them aside from continuing to publish quality work in quality journals ( or calling in a Mafia hit ) .
It seems clear that the Jones Gang felt threatened by the Climate Research paper .
By all appearances , they saw the threat as significant enough to consider the scientific equivalent of evidence - tampering in order to hide the sun .
Is this the kind of reaction we would expect from scientists interested in the truth ?
Or is it what we would expect from the infamous Mafioso John Gotti ?
Perhaps William Shakespeare said it best in his famous play of conspiracy and intrigue , Hamlet : " The lady doth protest too much , methinks . "
Japan wants consumers to start spending more Japan has agreed a 7.2 trillion yen ( $ 81bn ; £ 48 bn ) stimulus plan designed to prevent the country 's economy from slipping back into recession .
Japan 's economy grew for the second straight quarter between July and September , but the return of deflation has sparked fears growth could stall .
The strong yen is also holding back Japanese exporters .
The stimulus was due to be announced last Friday but was delayed after disagreements over its size .
This is the first major economic stimulus announcement by the newly elected Democratic Party of Japan .
The previous government unveiled a 15.4tn yen package in April this year .
' Fundamental issues '
" We must present an economic package promptly in order to make the economic recovery solid in the face of the current severe economic and employment situation , the yen 's rise and deflation , " the government said .
Japan 's economic recovery is unlikely to be sustained because the planned domestic stimulus package will likely prove ineffective
Seiji Shiraishi , HSBC
" We will do our utmost to regain Japan 's vigour . "
The package includes measures to bolster employment , extend incentives for energy efficient products , and provide loan guarantees to help small and medium - sized businesses .
However , analysts were sceptical about the impact the package would have .
" This may help the economy somewhat , but it does n't even begin to address the more fundamental issues facing Japan , such as weakness in the global economy and deflation , " said Yasunari Ueno at Mizuho Securities .
Japan 's economy is driven by exports , and measures targeting domestic consumers would enjoy limited success , analysts argued .
" Japan 's economic recovery is led by overseas government stimulus but is unlikely to be sustained because the planned domestic stimulus package will likely prove ineffective , " said Seiji Shiraishi at HSBC .
The yen recently hit a 14 - year high against the dollar , making Japanese exports more expensive in the US .
' The lost decade '
After four consecutive quarters of contraction , Japan finally emerged from recession earlier this year when the economy grew by 0.9 % in the April - to - June quarter .
It then grew by 1.2 % between July and September .
But the return of deflation for the first time since 2006 has dampened confidence .
Deflation means falling prices , which are bad for an economy as consumers hold off from spending , as they know they can buy the same goods for less in the future .
Japan has a history of struggling with deflation .
The 1990s are often referred to as Japan 's " lost decade " because of its 10 - year struggle with falling prices .
It followed a collapse in prices in the housing market and the stock market at the end of the 1980s .

January 2010 was the month President Barack Obama tried to get in touch with his inner populist .
Shaken by a Republican victory in Massachusetts and the likely defeat of his health - care bill , he adopted the lingo of an insurrectionary orator , calling out the big banks in his State of the Union address .
" If these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again , " he said , " they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need . "
For much of the media , that was enough to conjure an image of Mr. Obama in bib overalls at the head of a pitchfork army .
To cast this man as a populist , you need n't merely imagine an alternate America where a William Jennings Bryan , the explosive orator who ran unsuccessfully three times for the White House in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , has actually captured the presidency .
You need to imagine a Bryan who went to Harvard and taught at an elite law school , who received more money than his opponent from Wall Street and the corporate media , who personally intervened during the presidential campaign to help a bank bailout become law , who surrounded himself with advisers drawn from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup , and whose solution to an economic crisis has been to propose a program of corporate subsidies .
A populist ?
Even at his most liberal , pushing a plan to move the country toward universal health coverage , Mr. Obama 's idea of advancing reform is to cut deals with all the industries involved so they 'll back his legislation .

Different models predicted differing outlooks for Alpine species Some large - scale computer simulations may be overestimating the impact of climate change on biodiversity in some regions , researchers have suggested .
They said models that analyse vast areas often failed to take into account local variations , such as topography and microclimates .
Local - scale simulations , which did include these factors , often delivered a more optimistic outlook , they added .
The findings have been published in the journal , Science .
One of the studies cited in the paper looked at the fate of plant species in the Swiss Alps .
" A coarse European - scale model ( with 16 km by 16 km grid cells ) predicted a loss of all suitable habitats during the 21st Century , " the researchers wrote .
" Whereas a model run using local - scale data ( 25 m by 25 m grid cells ) predicted ( the ) persistence of suitable habitats for up to 100 % of plant species . "
Micro v macro Co-author Shonil Bhagwat , a senior research fellow at the University of Oxford , UK , said when vegetation was looked at on a smaller scale , scientists saw a different picture .
" For example , smaller plots give data on microclimatic variations , whereas large - scale models predict ( uniform ) changes throughout the landscape . "
Advances in computing power meant that more large - scale datasets were being made available to scientists , Dr Bhagwat explained .
" There is more interest in predicting widespread , large - scale effects , " he told BBC News , " that is why coarser - scale models are normally used .
" However , the changes in communities of vegetation occur at a much smaller scale . "
In the paper , Dr Bhagwat and co-author Professor Kathy Willis , wrote : " These studies highlight the complexities that we are faced with trying to model and predict the possible consequences of future climate change on biodiversity . "
The researchers called for more micro-scale studies to be carried out that complement the overall picture presented by larger models .
However , they added that the overall picture for biodiversity loss was still bleak , especially once the rate of habitat loss and fragmentation was taken into account .
" Predicting the fate of biodiversity in response to climate change combined with habitat fragmentation is a serious undertaking fraught with caveats and complexities , " they observed .
For example , Dr Bhagwat explained , the current system of having fixed nature reserves may need to be reconsidered .
" We have 12 % of the Earth 's land surface covered in protected areas , but climate change is likely to push species out of their home ranges and out of reserves , " he added .
" So we need to look beyond reserves and create the conditions that allow the migration of species . "

Liu Jin/ Agence France - Presse — Getty Images
Updated , Jan. 16 , 9:40 a.m. | Ross Anderson of Cambridge University joins the discussion .
He says the growing complexity and volume of Web traffic will only make government censorship harder .
When Google made the surprising announcement on Tuesday that it would no longer censor search results in China , it was applauded by human rights advocates around the world .
Since China is n’t likely to allow unfiltered results , which would bring up banned topics , Google would have to quit operating google.cn , its Chinese search engine .
But that may not be the end of the story .
The very tech savvy are starting to work around the government ’s filters .
Is it just a matter of time before the technologists defeat censorship broadly ?
What kinds of technological advances would that involve ?
Or will governments like China be able to maintain strong censorship control with ever more advanced technology on their side ?
What Web Sites Can Do
Jonathan Zittrain , a professor of law at Harvard Law School and co-founder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society , is the author of “ The Future of the Internet — And How to Stop It . ”
Most ways to get around filtering are on the demand side : the user has to do some work .
I ’d like to see some work done on the supply side , by Web sites themselves — and not just because of political censorship , but because of the many other reasons a site can become inaccessible , from a cyberattack to poor network connectivity .
We need a mutual aid treaty for the Internet , opted in one Web site at a time .
We can design new protocols so that participating Web sites can share information with one another , and in the event one goes down , others can mirror what had been there , in exchange for similar help should they be the next victims .
It ’s a kind of mutual aid treaty for the Internet , opted in one Web site at a time — creating a more robust infrastructure against all sorts of blockages .
Already , we ’re building an infrastructure with sites like Herdict so that users can report when they ca n’t get to a given site — something that web site operators are keen to know .
As a public early warning system develops for network trouble , the next logical step is to help patch them up as they happen .

There ’s little likelihood that China would want to hermetically seal itself the way a North Korea or Cuba has sought to achieve .
But there is some aspiration for a “ China Wide Web ” where most users would find themselves accessing local content , in Chinese , for most of their surfing .
That ’s why another trend to watch is the improvement of automatic translation tools .
When the world ’s peoples can speak fluently with one another , whether in blog comments , Wikipedia entries , tweets or instant messages , regardless of their native languages , that will be a quantum advance in the circulation of ideas .
A Matter of Cost
Steven M. Bellovin is a professor of computer science at Columbia University , where he specializes in networks , security , and why the two do n’t get along .
There ’s a saying in the security business : “ amateurs worry about algorithms ; pros worry about economics . ”
There ’s no doubt that China — or any government so - minded — can censor virtually everything ; it ’s just that the cost — cutting most communications lines , and deploying enough agents to vet the rest — is prohibitive .
The more interesting question is whether or not “ enough ” censorship is affordable .
How much effort are people and companies outside China willing to expend on anti-censoring measures ?
There are a variety of techniques that dissidents can use to evade the censors , ranging from obvious things like encryption to assorted anonymous networking techniques to breaking messages up into separate pieces that are nonsensical individually but turn into a real message when enough pieces are combined .
They can even use pictures , either normal ones with hidden messages embedded ( a technique known as “ steganography ” ) to screen shots of Web pages the government would n’t like .
Of course , there are some obvious countermeasures the government could employ , but they ’re costly — optical character recognition from pictures is possible but not easy to do efficiently .
China currently has more than 300,000,000 Internet users ; using heavyweight censorship techniques on all international connections is probably not affordable .
Read more …
Predicting what will happen requires answering three imponderable questions .
First , at what rate will anti-censorship technologies evolve , compared with what the censors can do ?
In this case , I ’d bet on the former ; there are more people who can work on free communications than can work on blocking it .
Second , how much effort and money will the government expend ?
That will change with the political winds , and probably ca n’t be predicted over time .
Finally , and perhaps most important , how much effort are people and companies outside China willing to expend on deploying countermeasures ?
Most anti-censorship schemes require help from the outside : people to run anonymity services , web sites willing to permit encrypted access to all of their content , etc .
( To give one example , I ca n’t read the New York Times using https .
Either the Web site was n’t set up to permit it or someone decided that it was too costly . )
It ’s easy for a government to block a few sites .
But what if most Internet traffic were encrypted ?
As Arlo Guthrie sang in Alice ’s Restaurant , “ And can you , can you imagine fifty people a day , I said fifty people a day walking in singin a bar of Alice ’s Restaurant and walking out .
And friends they may thinks it ’s a movement . ”
Is there a “ movement ” ?
Making Freedom Inconvenient
Timothy B. Lee is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and a member of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University .
He blogs at Bottom - Up .
Censorship is not primarily about technology .
Human beings are much smarter than computers , and they inevitably find ways to circumvent filters to get the content they want .
Rather , the basis of effective censorship in China , like all government power , is the ability to punish people in “ real life ” when they do something online the government does n’t like .
There is no purely technological solution because censorship is not primarily a technological problem .
The Chinese government knows that the “ Great Firewall of China ” wo n’t stop all attempts to access disfavored foreign Web sites .
That is not its goal .
The government simply seeks to make disfavored foreign Web sites inconvenient enough that most Chinese users will switch to homegrown alternatives that are under the government ’s thumb .
This allows the government to focus its human resources on the small minority of people who persist in circumventing the Great Firewall .
Google can do a lot of good by investing in improved circumvention technologies .
A worldwide network of proxy servers helped dissidents in Iran communicate with the outside world in the weeks after last year ’s disputed election .
Google could certainly invest in the creation of a more extensive , robust , and user - friendly network of proxy servers .
Read more …
Google can also help by embedding privacy - preserving and censorship - circumventing technologies more deeply into its existing products .
Its recent decision to encrypt GMail access by default is a good example .
Google might consider bundling circumvention software like Tor with its “ Google Pack ” of desktop software .
The more ubiquitous such software becomes , the harder it will be for the Chinese government to distinguish innocuous uses of the technology from subversive ones .
Still , there will never be a purely technological solution to censorship because censorship is not primarily a technological project .
No software can protect a Chinese citizen from the knock on his door when he ’s caught using circumvention software .
Nor can any software allow him to publish criticisms of the government without fear of reprisal .
Ultimately , defeating censorship is something that only the Chinese people themselves can accomplish by toppling their repressive regime .
There is little that Google , or any American company , can do to directly shape the evolution of China ’s political system .
But Google ’s withdrawal from China has important symbolic value .
Google has become one of the world ’s most prestigious brands , and for the last four years it has lent undeserved legitimacy to the government ’s censorship efforts .
Not a War , a Stalemate
Mikko Hypponen , an authority on cybercrime who has tracked down several online criminals , is the chief research officer at F - Secure Corporation in Helsinki , Finland .
I do n’t see how Google could win against China .
Google could be pushed out of China and the great firewall of China could block access to google.com and other global versions of Google .
For the Chinese end user , bypassing the great firewall is n’t hard if you know what you ’re doing .
However , the vast majority of the hundreds of millions of Chinese Internet users would not know how to do it .
For the Chinese end user , bypassing the great firewall is n’t hard , but that ’s not the issue .
I do n’t think Google and China will end up in an all - out war .
Here ’s what I think will happen : Google or the U.S. State Department will make more accusations against China .
China wo n’t respond at all or will respond with their usual confused statements .
Google will lift some , but not all of the censorship they have in place on google .cn .
The Chinese government wo n’t respond .
Time will pass and this whole event will soon be forgotten .
Meanwhile , the targeted Trojan attacks carry on as they have for several years .
Choices Made for Business
Tyler Moore is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University .
Online censorship will keep working so long as repressive governments continue to carry it out .
I say this not because I expect governments to maintain the upper hand technologically .
There are technical solutions to censorship , but they may never be scalable .
Computer scientists have long known that perfect censorship is practically impossible — holes in the great firewall can be found and filters remain incomplete .
However , the goal of censorship is merely to control most , not all , of a population .
Because the technologies available to fight censorship are unlikely to be adopted at a large scale , censorship will continue to be effective .
Technical solutions for defeating censorship were proposed and implemented a decade ago .
These systems are still used today by tech - savvy activists .
However , most targets of censorship — like Twitter , Facebook , and YouTube — can be successfully blocked because of architectural choices made for business reasons .
Read more …
Running
Web applications by storing and distributing content from central servers under the host ’s control can make sense in a free society where censorship is not a significant threat .
Centralized architectures are easier to design and more reliable in the absence of censorship .
They also help firms control and profit from the data which has been collected from users — think of Google serving up ads based on search terms , or Facebook making friend suggestions based on the existing social network .
Unfortunately , centralized architectures are easy targets of censorship , and from a business perspective , the advantages of the status quo outweigh the benefits of moving to a more robust design .
Online surveillance is another tactic used by repressive regimes ( spying on dissidents triggered Google ’s threatened pull - out of China ) , and again , the available countermeasures are n’t widely used .
Consider e-mail .
Until recently , communications between users ’ browsers and Gmail ’s servers were not encrypted by default .
This meant that , for instance , users checking their email at a WiFi hot - spot could have their communications eavesdropped .
Even with encryption between user and server , surveillance remains possible .
Because the e-mail itself is still sent unencrypted , a government could eavesdrop on the communication if the email is later intercepted ( say , at an Internet service provider close to the government ) .
A secure countermeasure to e-mail surveillance called PGP has been available for nearly 20 years .
Using PGP , email is encrypted so that only the sender and recipient , not the email provider or any government , can read the message .
So why does n’t everyone use PGP ?
First , it requires both sender and receiver to use the service .
Second , historically it has been difficult to use .
Third , the business models of Web - based email providers conflict with PGP — if the email itself is encrypted , then Gmail ca n’t decide which ads to show you .
In my view , the only long - term , scalable solution to Internet censorship and surveillance is political .
To that end , technology and the open Internet are essential .
Efforts to transparently document censorship , such as the Open Net Initiative and Herdict , might help shame repressive governments into change .
More Than a Tech Problem
Ron Deibert is the director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto ’s Munk Centre for International Studies , a principal investigator of the OpenNet Initiative and Information Warfare Monitor projects , and the vice president of policy for Psiphon Inc .
For years , innovative solutions to sidestep Internet filters have plagued Internet censors .
Rebellious kids , hoping to sneak a peek around parental controls , have come up with some of the best of these ideas .
Others are highly sophisticated open - source systems tended to by brainy PhD. ’s and caffeine - fueled programmers .
We need a worldwide movement of citizens and policymakers to protect the Internet as an open global source of information .
Will Google now devote some of its formidable engineering resources to the problem of censorship circumvention ?
Will the people behind Google mail , Google wave and Google docs bring us something like Google Free ?
Surely a company as powerful as Google can invent an app that guarantees Internet freedom .
The problem is that circumventing Internet censorship is at least as much a social and political problem now as it is technological .
And that ’s because the nature of controls exercised in this domain are changing .
Read more …
As documented by the OpenNet Initiative , cyberspace controls are evolving from technical filtering of Web requests to a variety of next - generation methods that are more subtle and offensive in nature .
These methods can involve the imposition of stringent terms - of - use policies that stifle freedom of speech to informal pressures on Internet service providers to remove information or turn over user data they collect .
More insidiously , they can include the outsourcing of computer network attacks on threatening sources of information or the use of cyberespionage systems of the type we found in Ghostnet , and which have plagued Google and other companies in recent weeks .
These next - generation controls are effective precisely because they do not rely on a single technological filter that can be overcome by the latest app .
They create a social and political climate of risk , intimidation and fear .
Social and political controls like these require social and political solutions .
Does this mean Google has no role to play in keeping the Internet free and open ?
Certainly it can make a contribution .
Taking a principled stand and encouraging other companies to follow suit is a good start , as would be the donation of some of its engineering time to censorship circumvention .
But what is required today goes beyond what a single company can achieve , even one as vast and influential as Google .
We need a worldwide movement involving citizens and policymakers to protect the Internet as an open global source of information .
The onus is on all of us .
China May Succeed
James Andrew Lewis is a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and directs its technology and public policy program .
A few years ago I worked on a C.I.A. study on how information technology would change the politics of nondemocratic countries .
There is clearly a political effect from access to information and the ability of regime opponents to coordinate and plan , but one country in the world has spent billions on technology to defeat this : China .
We concluded that for now , the Chinese government would be able to control the political effects of information technology .
As manufacturing moves to Asia , it will be easier for China to build controls into the technologies its citizens use .
China is in a good position to succeed .
As manufacturing moves to Asia , it will be easier to build controls into the technologies China ’s citizens use .
China wants its own IT industry and has been investing for decades in the people and plants it will need to get one .
The policy has two goals : expanding the ability to control IT and ending the dependence on Western technology .
Read more …
It is important to use the right measure of success .
Success for Beijing is blocking any serious opposition , not foreign content .
So far , China has stayed ahead .
It ’s a delicate dance — China wants openness for access to Western technology ( and they build on openness with aggressive cyberespionage ) , but this same openness brings political risk .
Information technology will bring political change to China , but the process will be neither quick nor easy .
One caveat : the study ’s most interesting conclusion was that IT and information had a democratizing effect if by democratization we mean broader participation in a political process rather than an endorsement of Western political values .
As we ’ve seen with Jihadi use of the Internet , there are many outcomes that access to information and IT can bring and not all of them are favorable .
China ’s “ netizens ” have gained some influence , and this influence will grow , but the direction it could take is uncertain .
Getting a more democratic China may have more to do with how well the U.S. engages China and how persuasive our example and our rhetoric will be in pointing toward an open society rather than finding a few technological fixes to breach the great firewall .
The Dictator ’s Dilemma
Ross Anderson is Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University , England , and author of The Snooping Dragon , as well as the standard textbook Security Engineering .
Governments have always tried to control information , but the game is changing fast .
Globalization is shifting the real power from national post offices , press censors and police forces to private companies .
Overall , that ’s a good thing ; it ’s easier to set up a new company than a new country .
Filtering is becoming ever harder , and blocking entire sites now has serious side effects .
It ’s technically possible to filter the Internet but it ’s getting ever harder in practice because of the growing volume and complexity of traffic , and because of the growing use of encryption .
And the
consolidation of services in large “ Web 2.0 ″ firms like Google , Microsoft and Facebook poses a new dilemma for dictators .
If you want to block some content on YouTube , the only practical ways to do that may be to get YouTube to cooperate , or to block the whole site : you “ block it all , or not at all . ”
But blocking it all can have serious side effects .
If you block all of YouTube ( as Thailand and Pakistan have tried ) , your schools will suffer and your population , deprived of entertainment , might get restive .

I ’ll ask again … how ’s that nomination working out for you Mr. President ?
Here are a few more knives in your back from Ms. Perino .
Dana does n’t think we should have a tax to pay for Afghanistan because then people really wo n’t like the war .
Heaven forbid anyone would expect someone to pay for the military industrial complex instead of putting it on the credit card for the grandkids .
Wallace :
If the leaks are correct and if the President announces somewhere between 30 - 35,000 more troops and trying to ask NATO for another 5000 and gets pretty close , maybe not all the way but pretty close to McChrystal ’s initial request of 40,000 , will conservatives declare victory and say look , the President has the right strategy ?
Perino : I do n’t know if they ’ll declare victory but I do think they ’ll rally behind the President and the Commander in Chief .
I think they ’ll have to set aside the fact that they think there was a really sloppy process ; that he undermined President Karzai ; that he alienated Gen.
McChrystal and say this is the right thing to do .
We wish he would n’t talk about exit ramps so soon , but this is the right thing to do and providing the generals what they need .
I think on the jobs issue though and on the cost one of the House Democrats , a leading House Democrat suggested that we increase taxes in order to pay for this .
And I think tying taxes to this war , one is a bad thing to do in a recession , two it even more unpopular and one of the things that President Obama will need to do is rally the nation and say that he ’s fully behind this .
Wallace : Yeah , wait a minute , you said he alienated or the process alienated President Karzai .
There are an awful lot of people who say Karzai has been a bad actor , a weak actor and it ’s important for the President in the course of this to make it clear to Karzai either you clean up your act or we ’re not going to be there .
Perino :
All of those things may be true .
He might not have done enough , but he is the guy that you have to go into battle with in order to try to win this war and so alienating him so publicly was a bad idea .
I think they probably thought that the other guy was going to win ; Abdullah Abdullah was going to win .
He did n’t and then we had another delay waiting to get McChrystal the troops that he needed .
President Karzai is the president that they ’re going to have to work with .
Men may want to consider drinking coffee as a new study reveals it could help cut prostate cancer risk .
Despite researchers saying its too early for physicians to start recommending upping ones coffee intake , initial findings in a study presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research Conference indicate that there is a link between the beverage and cancer risk .
Prostate cancer can typically affect men ages 60 or older and can be detected by high .
Researchers observed 50,000 men and their coffee intake every four years for two decades .
They found that over the course of that time , 4,975 men developed prostate cancer .
The scientists noted that those who drank the most coffee had a 60 percent less chance of cancer occurrence .
Researcher Dr. Kathryn
Wilson felt that this study is a step in the right direction , as few personal habits have been linked to cancer prevention .
“ Very few lifestyle factors have been consistently associated with prostate cancer risk , especially with risk of aggressive disease , so it would be very exciting if this association is confirmed in other studies , ” said Wilson .
Just a tiny thing .
But enough to inspire Doctor Who fanfic writers the world over .
I understand from well - connected - fan - chatter combined with a little birdie at BBC America that in the end - of - year Doctor Who specials , and yes I am eeking this out a bit so that there are no spoilers for the front page of Bleeding Cool , I 've got in enough trouble for that before and I really do n't want to be threatened by a sharpened sonic screwdriver again … okay is that it ?
I think that 's it .
Okay .
Where were we ?
Oh yes .
Anyway , in Torchwood , we were told that Martha Jones was on her honeymoon .
And most people presumed that she was hitched to Tom Milligan , the nurse from Last Of The Time Lords .
Well , in the end of year Christmas Doctor Who specials I understand that we will learn that somewhere , somewhen , Martha Jones married … no not Nurse Tom , sorry people , but …
Mickey Smith , Rose Tyler 's ex .
Is this the first time one Doctor Who companion has officially got together with another ( in series canon ) ?
Yes , I think it is .
There had been some chatter about this kind of thing back in the summer , but a lot of it was dismissed .
Well , now it seems that bells are going to chime .
I can see that , I mean who else can you share stories about Daleks on those long winter nights ?
The last time we saw her in Doctor Who was with Captain Jack , with Mickey racing to catch up with them .
At the time Martha was intended to appear in the next Torchwood series , but the actress Freema Agyeman 's decision to jump to Law & Order : UK with ex-Torchwood producer Chris Chibnall scuppered that , with some series resulting rewrites ( we got the joyous wonder of Children of Earth as a result though , so hey , no worries there )
And yes , that rending sound is a lot of fanfic writers ripping up their tomes in frustration and rage .
Sorry guys .
Oh and those with the Mickey / Martha slashfic ?
Ahead of your time , ladies and gentlemen , ahead of your …
And since you 're all here , here 's a quick look at that upcoming Christmas episode …
End Of Time …
WASHINGTON — Beware the math .
Some Republican lawmakers critical of President Barack Obama ’s stimulus package are using grade - school arithmetic to size up costs and consequences of all that spending .
The math is satisfyingly simple but highly misleading .
It goes like this : Divide the stimulus money spent so far by the estimated number of jobs saved or created .
ADVERTISEMENT
That produces a rather frightening figure on how much money taxpayers are spending for each job .
On Friday , the White House released estimates that $ 160 billion in stimulus spending created or preserved 650,000 direct jobs .
By the critics ’ calculations , that ’s over $ 246,000 a job – and a terrible deal for taxpayers .
Why spend nearly $ 250,000 to employ a highway worker or a teacher making a small fraction of that ?
The reality is more complex .
First , the naysayers ’ calculations ignore the value of the work produced .
Any cost - per - job figure pays not just for the worker , but for material , supplies and that worker ’s output – a portion of a road paved , patients treated in a health clinic , goods shipped from a factory floor , railroad tracks laid .
Second , critics are counting the total cost of contracts that will fuel work for months or years and dividing that by the number of jobs produced only to date .

An Avondale woman who spent 11 days sleeping in her car said the city treated her unfairly when her home was condemned in December for lack of electricity .
But city officials said Christine Stevens violated building codes , a health and safety concern because Avondale homes are required to have heating systems and a running refrigerator .
Avondale home with no electricity condemned
Stevens , 47 , was trying to make ends meet by powering her home with solar panels and batteries for several months before Avondale code enforcement officials visited her on Dec. 10 .
" We explained to her that the panels were n't enough to sustain a quality of life there , " said Pam Altounian , code enforcement manager for Avondale .
Stevens said she was not given adequate notice before officials gave her 24 hours to contact Arizona Public Service Co. to reconnect electricity or her home would be condemned .
Avondale said a code enforcement officer , Carlena Jones , inspected the property in the 2300 block of North 123rd Lane on Oct. 21 and Nov. 4 and left a notice of violation hanging on the door .
According to case reports , both notices went unanswered .
" I acknowledged that I remembered seeing something but it did n't look official , and I only saw one .
It looked like something from my homeowners association , " said Stevens , who lives in the Rancho Santa Fe subdivision .
But Avondale records show Stevens told officials she had received both notices , marked : " Avondale code advisory . "
Both hangers give a notice of complaint and instructions to call a code officer .
Case documents cite a complaint from a neighbor in October .
The unidentified woman complained about the property 's appearance and said she believed there was no electricity powering the home .
When Stevens failed to contact Avondale after Nov. 4 , Altounian contacted Avondale police and asked for information on her home .
Disputes with APS , Avondale
Police told the city that APS had filed a theft of services complaint on Sept. 14 , said Reuben Gonzales , spokesman for Avondale police .
APS told police that the home had been disconnected from electricity since January 2009 , but that an electric meter had been tampered with in September .
Stevens , who had a roommate and was in California at the time , said whoever tampered with the meter did so without her knowledge .
As the homeowner , she took responsibility for the complaint , paid about $ 400 , according to Avondale Municipal Court documents , and discontinued use of electricity .
" Once we received notification from police that she had been without electricity for some time , things changed and we were very concerned about health and safety at that point , " Altounian said .
Avondale officials said Stevens was in violation of the city 's building codes .
The city requires homes to have enough electricity to power a refrigerator , cool a residence to no higher than 88 degrees and heat a residence to at least 68 degrees .
Stevens told The Republic that six solar panels and eight batteries in her home provided light and powered either a computer or a television for three bedrooms .
Stevens used an ice box for food and in September began to power a refrigerator with assistance from neighbors , who allowed her to run an extension - cord between the two homes .
She did not power heating or cooling systems , but said that she managed without them by using her pool in the summer and sweaters in the cooler months .
Layoff triggers financial woes
Stevens was laid off as a risk compliance officer for Wells Fargo Bank in January 2009 .
She has been working as a security guard for Trident Security Services , making $ 200 a week , since November , she said .
After a failed payment to APS in January 2009 , her electricity was disconnected and Stevens decided to discontinue use of electricity in her home .
Stevens said she understood that officials were doing their job but felt they did not provide her housing assistance , despite informing them that APS would not be able to fix the meter for several days after Dec. 10 .
APS spokesman Damon Gross confirmed that a winter storm " strongly impacted " the company around that time and that Stevens ' electricity was reconnected on Dec.22 .
Stevens said she informed Jones , the code enforcement officer , that she " had no place to go " and that she was grateful her dogs were allowed to remain in her property , because they did n't fit in her 1997 Mazda Miata with her .
Avondale officials said they unaware that Stevens was living in her car or they would have offered further assistance .
Case reports show enforcement officials offered Stevens social services information on Dec. 10 and asked her if she had a place to stay on Dec. 15 , to which she replied " yes . "
Stevens said she had no knowledge of building codes and was unaware that solar panels must be inspected .
She has since paid about $ 1,338 to APS , including overdue fees dating to January 2009 , theft of services payment , and reinstallation fees .
Stevens is back at home but was unable to pay two mortgage payments on the house and is now in danger of losing it , she said .
She hopes her ordeal will help others avoid similar mistakes .
" Electricity was the last thing on my mind , " Stevens said .
Unfortunately , mostly due to marketing there is a feminine stigma when it comes to Yeast infections or Candidiasis .
Some men think only women get yeast infections and other men are embarrassed to admit yeast infections occur in men .
Although it is more common for women to get yeast infections because of their anatomy , it is pretty common to see yeast infections in men .
The most common place a man will get yeast infections is in the mouth or throat known as thrush .
Secondly , yeast infections in men can occur as candida overgrowth on their penis .
Uncircumcised men would be more susceptible to this because the foreskin allows for more favorable conditions for growth .
Other spaces on the skin can also be prone to growth if the man has a compromised immune system and internally in the intestines , blood and organs Candida can sometimes grow .
It is important that men are aware that yeast infections in men are common and it is nothing to feel embarrassed about .
The important thing would be for the man to get help so that the yeast infection does n’t grow out of control and cause serious harm .
If you are a man that is suffering with Candidiasis there are many resources available for you to live free from infections .
Making dietary changes or by completing a program like Yeast Infection No More is a good place to start treating yeast infections in men .
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - A US Airways passenger plane was diverted to Philadelphia on Thursday after a religious item worn by a Jewish passenger was mistaken as a bomb , Philadelphia police said .
A passenger was alarmed by the phylacteries , religious items which observant Jews strap around their arms and heads as part of morning prayers , on the flight from New York ’s La Guardia airport heading to Louisville .
“ Someone on the plane construed it as some kind of device , ” said officer Christine O’Brien , a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia police department .
No one was arrested or charged , O’Brien said .
The plane landed without incident and the passengers and crew were taken off the plane , a spokesman for US Airways said .
Phylacteries , called tefillin in Hebrew , are two small black boxes with black straps attached to them .
Observant Jewish men are required to place one box on their head and tie the other one on their arm each weekday morning .
Thursday ’s incident was the latest of several false alarms on U.S. flights since the December 25 incident in which a Nigerian man attempted to detonate a bomb in his underpants from materials he smuggled onto the plane just as his flight was about to land in Detroit , authorities said .
The device did not explode and only burned the man , who was pounced on by fellow passengers .
Since then several flights have been diverted by security scares that have turned out to be harmless .
Thank God for Helen Thomas , the only person to show any courage at the White House press briefing after President Barack Obama gave a flaccid account of the intelligence screw - up that almost downed an airliner on Christmas Day .
After Obama briefly addressed L’Affaire Abdulmutallab and wrote " must do better " on the report cards of the national security schoolboys responsible for the near catastrophe , the president turned the stage over to counter - terrorism guru John Brennan and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
It took 89 - year - old veteran correspondent Helen Thomas to break through the vapid remarks about rechanneling " intelligence streams , " fixing " no - fly " lists , deploying " behavior detection officers , " and buying more body - imaging scanners .
Thomas recognized the John & Janet filibuster for what it was , as her catatonic press colleagues took their customary dictation and asked their predictable questions .
Instead ,
Thomas posed an adult query that spotlighted the futility of government plans to counter terrorism with more high - tech gizmos and more intrusions on the liberties and privacy of the traveling public .
She asked why Abdulmutallab did what he did .
Thomas : " And what is the motivation ?
We never hear what you find out on why . "
Brennan : " Al - Qaeda is an organization that is dedicated to murder and wanton slaughter of innocents . …
They attract individuals like Mr. Abdulmutallab and use them for these types of attacks .
He was motivated by a sense of religious sort of drive .
Unfortunately , al - Qaeda has perverted Islam , and has corrupted the concept of Islam , so that he ’s [ sic ] able to attract these individuals .
But al - Qaeda has the agenda of destruction and death . "
Thomas : " And you ’re saying it ’s because of religion ? "
Brennan : " I ’m saying it ’s because of an al - Qaeda organization that used the banner of religion in a very perverse and corrupt way . "
Thomas : " Why ? "
Brennan : " I think this is a – long issue , but al - Qaeda is just determined to carry out attacks here against the homeland . "
Thomas : " But you have n’t explained why . "
Neither did President Obama , nor anyone else in the U.S. political / media hierarchy .
All the American public gets is the boilerplate about how al - Qaeda evildoers are perverting a religion and exploiting impressionable young men .
There is almost no discussion about why so many people in the Muslim world object to U.S. policies so strongly that they are inclined to resist violently and even resort to suicide attacks .
Obama ’s Non-Answer
I had been hoping Obama would say something intelligent about what drove Abdulmutallab to do what he did , but the president uttered a few vacuous comments before sending in the clowns .
This is what he said before he walked away from the podium :
" It is clear that al Qaeda increasingly seeks to recruit individuals without known terrorist affiliations … to do their bidding . …
And that ’s why we must communicate clearly to Muslims around the world that al - Qaeda offers nothing except a bankrupt vision of misery and death … while the United States stands with those who seek justice and progress . …
That ’s the vision that is far more powerful than the hatred of these violent extremists . "
But why it is so hard for Muslims to " get " that message ?
Why ca n’t they end their preoccupation with dodging U.S. missiles in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Yemen , and Gaza long enough to reflect on how we are only trying to save them from terrorists while simultaneously demonstrating our commitment to " justice and progress " ?
Does a smart fellow like Obama expect us to believe that all we need to do is " communicate clearly to Muslims " that it is al - Qaeda , not the U.S. and its allies , that brings " misery and death " ?
Does any informed person not know that the unprovoked , U.S. - led invasion of Iraq killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and displaced 4.5 million from their homes ?
How is that for “ misery and death ” ?
Rather than a failure to communicate , U.S. officials are trying to rewrite recent history , which seems to be much easier to accomplish with the Washington press corps and large segments of the American population than with the Muslim world .
But why is n’t there a frank discussion by America ’s leaders and media about the real motivation of Muslim anger toward the United States ?
Why was Helen Thomas the only journalist to raise the touchy but central question of motive ?
Peeking Behind the Screen
We witnessed a similar phenomenon when the 9/11 Commission Report tiptoed into a cautious discussion of possible motives behind the 9/11 attacks .
To their credit , the drafters of that report apparently went as far as their masters would allow , in gingerly introducing a major elephant into the room :
" America ’s policy choices have consequences .
Right or wrong , it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world . " ( p. 376 )
When asked later about the flabby way that last sentence ended , former Congressman Lee Hamilton , vice - chair of the 9/11 Commission , explained that there had been a donnybrook over whether that paragraph could be included at all .
The drafters also squeezed in the reason given by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as to why he " masterminded " the attacks on 9/11 :
" By his own account , KSM ’s animus toward the United States stemmed … from his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel . "
Would you believe that former Vice President Dick Cheney has also pointed to U.S. support for Israel as one of the " true sources of resentment " ?
This unique piece of honesty crept into his speech to the American Enterprise Institute on May 21 , 2009 .
Sure , he also trotted out the bromide that the terrorists hate " all the things that make us a force for good in the world . "
But the Israel factor slipped into the speech , perhaps an inadvertent acknowledgment of the Israeli albatross adorning the neck of U.S. policy in the Middle East .
Very few pundits and academics are willing to allude to this reality , presumably out of fear for their future career prospects .
Former senior CIA officer Paul Pillar , now a professor at Georgetown University , is one of the few willing to refer , in his typically understated way , to " all the other things … including policies and practices that affect the likelihood that people … will be radicalized , and will try to act out the anger against us . "
One has to fill in the blanks regarding what those “ other things ” are .
But no worries .
Secretary Napolitano has a fix for this unmentionable conundrum .
It ’s called " counter - radicalization , " which she describes thusly : " How do we identify someone before they become radicalized to the point where they ’re ready to blow themselves up with others on a plane ?
And how do we communicate better American values and so forth … around the globe ? "
Better communication .
That ’s the ticket .
Hypocrisy and Double Talk
But Napolitano does n’t acknowledge the underlying problem , which is that many Muslims have watched Washington ’s behavior closely for many years and view U.S. declarations about peace , justice , democracy , and human rights as infuriating examples of hypocrisy and double talk .
So , Washington ’s sanitized discussion about motives for terrorism seems more intended for the U.S. domestic audience than the Muslim world .
After all , people in the Middle East already know how Palestinians have been mistreated for decades ; how Washington has propped up Arab dictatorships ; how Muslims have been locked away at Guantanamo without charges ; how the U.S. military has killed civilians in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere ; how U.S. mercenaries have escaped punishment for slaughtering innocents .
The purpose of U.S. " public diplomacy " appears more designed to shield Americans from this unpleasant reality , offering instead feel - good palliatives about the beneficence of U.S. actions .
Most American journalists and politicians go along with the charade out of fear that otherwise they would be accused of lacking patriotism or sympathizing with " the enemy . "
Commentators who are neither naïve nor afraid are simply shut out of the Fawning Corporate Media ( FCM ) .
Salon.com ’s Glenn Greenwald , for example , has complained loudly about " how our blind , endless enabling of Israeli actions fuels terrorism directed at the U.S. , " and how it is taboo to point this out .
Greenwald recently called attention to a little - noticed Associated Press report on the possible motives of the 23 - year - old Nigerian Abdulmutallab .
The report quoted his Yemeni friends to the effect that the he was " not overtly extremist . "
But they noted that he was open about his sympathies toward the Palestinians and his anger over Israel ’s actions in Gaza .
Former CIA specialist on al - Qaeda Michael Scheuer has been still more outspoken on what he sees as Israel ’s tying down the American Gulliver in the Middle East .
Speaking Monday on C - SPAN , he complained bitterly that any debate on the issue of American support for Israel and its effects is normally squelched .
Scheuer added that the Israel Lobby had just succeeded in getting him removed from his job at the Jamestown Foundation think - tank for saying that Obama was " doing what I call the Tel Aviv Two Step . "
More to the point , Scheuer asserted , " For anyone to say that our support for Israel does n’t hurt us in the Muslim world … is to just defy reality . "
Beyond loss of work , those who speak out can expect ugly accusations .
The Israeli media network Arutz Sheva , which is considered the voice of the settler movement , weighed in strongly , citing Scheuer ’s C- SPAN remarks and branding them " blatantly anti-Semitic . "
Media Squelching
As for media squelching , I continue to be amazed at how otherwise informed folks express total surprise when I refer them to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ’s statement about his motivation for attacking the United States , as cited on page 147 of the 9/11 Commission Report :
" By his own account , KSM ’s animus toward the United States stemmed not from his experience there as a student , but rather from his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel . "
And one can understand how even those following such things closely can get confused .
Five years after the 9/11 Commission Report , on Aug. 30 , 2009 , readers of the neoconservative Washington Post were given a diametrically different view , based on what the Post called " an intelligence summary : "
" KSM ’s limited and negative experience in the United States – which included a brief jail stay because of unpaid bills – almost certainly helped propel him on his path to becoming a terrorist . …
He stated that his contact with Americans , while minimal , confirmed his view that the United States was a debauched and racist country . "
Apparently , the Post found this revisionist version politically more convenient , in that it obscured Mohammed ’s other explanation implicating " U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel . "
It ’s much more comforting to view KSM as a disgruntled visitor who nursed his personal grievances into justification for mass murder .
An unusually candid view of the dangers accruing from the U.S. identification with Israel ’s policies appeared five years ago in an unclassified study published by the Pentagon - appointed U.S. Defense Science Board on Sept. 23 , 2004 .
Contradicting President George W. Bush , the board stated :
" Muslims do not ‘ hate our freedom , ’ but rather , they hate our policies .
The overwhelming majority voice their objections to what they see as one - sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights , and the long - standing , even increasing support for what Muslims collectively see as tyrannies , most notably Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Pakistan , and the Gulf States .
" Thus , when American public diplomacy talks about bringing democracy to Islamic societies , this is seen as no more than self - serving hypocrisy . "
Abdulmutallab ’s Attack
Getting back to Abdulmutallab and his motive in trying to blow up the airliner , how was this individual without prior terrorist affiliations suddenly transformed into an international terrorist ready to die while killing innocents ?
If , as John Brennan seems to suggest , al - Qaeda terrorists are hard - wired for terrorism at birth for the " wanton slaughter of innocents , " how are they able to jump - start a privileged 23 - year - old Nigerian , inculcate in him with the acquired characteristics of a terrorist , and persuade him to do the bidding of al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ?
As indicated above , the young Nigerian seems to have had particular trouble with Israel ’s wanton slaughter of more than a thousand civilians in Gaza a year ago , a brutal campaign that was defended in Washington as justifiable self - defense .
Moreover , it appears that Abdulmutallab is not the only anti-American " terrorist " so motivated .
When the Saudi and Yemeni branches of al - Qaeda announced that they were uniting into " al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , " their combined rhetoric railed against the Israeli attack on Gaza .
And on Dec. 30 , Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al - Balawi , a 32 - year - old Jordanian physician from a family of Palestinian origin , killed seven American CIA operatives and one Jordanian intelligence officer near Khost , Afghanistan , when he detonated a suicide bomb .
Though most U.S. media stories treated al - Balawi as a fanatical double - agent driven by irrational hatreds , other motivations could be gleaned by carefully reading articles about his personal history .
Al - Balawi ’s mother told Agence France - Presse that her son had never been an " extremist . "
Al - Balawi ’s widow , Defne Bayrak , made a similar statement to Newsweek .
In a New York Times article , al - Balawi ’s brother was quoted as describing him as a " very good brother " and a " brilliant doctor . "
So what led al - Balawi to take his own life in order to kill U.S. and Jordanian intelligence operatives ?
Al - Balawi ’s widow said her husband " started to change " after the American - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
His brother said al - Balawi " changed " during last year ’s three - week - long Israeli offensive in Gaza , which killed about 1,300 Palestinians .
When al - Balawi volunteered with a medical organization to treat injured Palestinians in Gaza , he was arrested by Jordanian authorities , his brother said .
It was after that arrest that the Jordanian intelligence service apparently coerced or " recruited " al - Balawi to become a spy who would penetrate al - Qaeda ’s hierarchy and provide actionable intelligence to the CIA .
" If you catch a cat and put it in a corner , she will jump on you , " the brother said in explaining why al - Balawi would turn to a suicide attack .
" My husband was anti-American ; so am I , " his widow said , adding that her two little girls would grow up fatherless but that she had no regrets .
Answering Helen
Are we starting to get the picture of what the United States is up against in the Muslim world ?
Does Helen
Thomas deserve an adult answer to her question about motive ?
Has President Obama been able to assimilate all this ?
Or is the U.S. political / media establishment incapable of confronting this reality and / or taking meaningful action to alleviate the underlying causes of the violence ?
Is the reported reaction of a CIA official to al - Balawi ’s attack the appropriate one : “ Last week ’s attack will be avenged .
Some very bad people will eventually have a very bad day " ?
Revenge has not always turned out very well in the past .
Does anyone remember the brutal killing of four Blackwater contractors on March 31 , 2004 , when they took a wrong turn and ended up in the Iraqi city of Fallujah – and how U.S. forces virtually leveled that large city in retribution after George W. Bush won his second term the following November ?
If you read only the Fawning Corporate Media , you would blissfully think that the killing of the four Blackwater operatives was the work of fanatical animals who got – along with their neighbors – what they deserved .
You would n’t know that the killings represented the second turn in that specific cycle of violence .
On March 22 , 2004 , Israeli forces assassinated the then - spiritual leader of Hamas in Gaza , Sheikh Yassin – a withering old man , blind and confined to a wheelchair .
That murder , plus sloppy navigation by the Blackwater men , set the stage for the next set of brutalities .
The Blackwater operatives were killed by a group that described itself as the " Sheikh Yassin Revenge Brigade . "
Pamphlets and posters were all over the scene of the attack ; one of the trucks that pulled around body parts of the mercenaries had a poster of Yassin in its window , as did store fronts all over Fallujah .
We can wish Janet Napolitano luck with her " counter - radicalization " project and President Obama with his effort to “ communicate clearly to Muslims , ” but there will be no diminution in the endless cycles of violence unless legitimate grievances are addressed on all sides .
It might also help if the American people were finally let in on the root causes for what otherwise get dismissed as irrational actions by Muslims .

OAKLAND , California ( Reuters ) - California ’s ban on gay marriage goes to trial on Monday in a federal case that plaintiffs hope to take all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and overturn bans throughout the nation .

California 's ban on gay marriage goes to trial on Monday in a federal case that plaintiffs hope to take all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and overturn bans throughout the nation .

Victory for gay rights groups in the Supreme Court , which might not choose to take the case if it is appealed that far , would make marriage a fundamental constitutional right without exception and overturn laws and state amendments limiting marriage to a man and a woman in 40 states .
A loss in the top court , two ranks above the action that starts on Monday , would derail efforts to win in state courts that have been a hallmark of the gay rights movement thus far .
The case begins in a San Francisco court presided over by District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker , who clearly enjoyed preliminary sessions , joking with lawyers between barrages of pointed questions .
The United States is divided on gay marriage .
It is legal in only five states , although most of those , and the District of Columbia , approved it last year .
The approval of California ’s Prop 8 in November 2008 was a sweet victory for social conservatives in a state with a liberal , trend - setting reputation and showed off the resounding success conservatives have had at the ballot box on the issue .
California ’s top court had legalized gay marriage in the summer of 2008 , months before Prop 8 passed .
Gay rights lawyers in the case describe their battle as a continuation of the fight against racist laws that had stopped whites and blacks from marrying .
Marriage is a fundamental constitutional right and , in addition , gays and lesbians deserve special protection from discrimination , they say .
The lawyers defending the ban say long traditions limit marriage to heterosexual couples and that a state , without malice , can be cautious about changing the institution .
Heterosexual couples can have children , which society needs to continue , they add .
While a court battle to the Supreme Court would stretch over years , the trial beginning on Monday may take only two weeks .
GAY PARENTS
“ Issues about parents and children and the role of child rearing will be central to this case , ” said Joan Hollinger , a lecturer in family law at the University of California , Berkeley .
The lack of societal acceptance of same - sex marriages was a problem for children of those relationships -- an argument for allowing gay marriage , she said .
Ted Olson and David Boies , two high - powered lawyers who faced off over the legality of George W. Bush ’s election win as U.S. president against Al Gore in 2000 , have joined forces in an odd - couple team fighting for gay marriage .
Andrew Koppelman , a professor of constitutional law at Northwestern University , said an appeal is certain no matter who wins in court in San Francisco .
If the appeals court were to side with the ban , the Supreme Court would probably leave it , but a victory by the gay rights advocates in the appeals court would force the Supreme Court to act , since it could not ignore such a momentous change .
“ There is no way to keep this out of the Supreme Court if they win , ” said Koppelman , who has written books arguing in favor of same - sex marriage but sees this push as ill - timed due to the composition of the nine - member top court .
“ Who are going to be your five votes on the Supreme Court ?
I have trouble getting to one . ”
UNITED NATIONS , United States —
The United Nations General Assembly gave its final stamp of approval today to a strongly worded resolution condemning Iran for a long list of human rights violations .
By a vote of 74 to 49 , with 59 abstentions , the General Assembly confirmed an earlier vote by its Third Committee in November on a resolution that expresses " deep concern at serious ongoing and recurring human rights violations in the Islamic Republic of Iran . "
Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations , said the resolution sends a stern message to Iran .
" Day by day , human rights continue to deteriorate in Iran , " said Ms. Dugal .
" This vote matters very much because the General Assembly has now fully , clearly , and powerfully expressed itself over Iran 's flagrant abuse of human rights .
" Our hope is that the government will heed this call and begin to respect the universally recognized rights of its citizens .
" As a first step to that , Iran could allow independent UN special rapporteurs into their country , as called for by the resolution , " she said .
The list of violations outlined this year was among the most extensive in some 25 years of UN resolutions on human rights in Iran .
Specifically , the resolution expresses concern about oppressive measures taken after the June presidential election , the use of torture , the repeated abuse of legal rights , the violent repression of women , and " increasing discrimination " against minority groups , including " Arabs , Azeris , Baluchis , Kurds , Christians , Jews , Sufis and Sunni Muslims and their defenders . "
It makes extensive mention of the persecution of Baha 'is , expressing concern over " attacks on Baha 'is and their faith in State - sponsored media , increasing evidence of efforts by the State to identify , monitor and arbitrarily detain Baha 'is , preventing members of the Baha'i Faith from attending university and from sustaining themselves economically . "
The resolution also expresses concern over the continued detention of seven Baha 'i leaders who were arrested in March and May 2008 , stating they have faced " serious charges without adequate or timely access to legal representation . "
Ms. Dugal noted that attorneys for the seven were recently informed their trial has now been set for 12 January 2010 .
Two earlier trial dates for the seven had been set but were postponed for various reasons .
" This year 's resolution points out the degree to which Iran has abused the legal process and denied many of their citizens the right to a fair trial .
" We therefore remain gravely concerned about the likely trial of these seven innocent Baha 'is , who have been wrongly accused and improperly held .
The charges against them are utterly baseless , and they should be released immediately , " said Ms. Dugal .
Hopes of a diplomatic breakthrough over Iran 's nuclear programme were dwindling tonight after Tehran demanded changes to a uranium exchange deal that European diplomats described as " unacceptable " .
If the deal collapses , as seems likely , it would deliver another critical blow to Barack Obama 's policy of engagement , and put international sanctions and Israeli military action back on the table .
The uranium deal , agreed in principle in Geneva at the beginning of the month , involved Iran shipping out most of its enriched uranium and , in return , being provided about a year later with fuel rods for its research reactor in Tehran .
Iran 's response , delivered after a week 's delay to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , was not made public , but according to diplomats familiar with the details , Tehran demanded two big changes : Iran would only ship its uranium out in batches , and only when the French - made fuel rods were delivered .
That would remove the element of the deal that made it attractive to the west : the temporary removal of most of Iran 's enriched uranium , which is currently enough to make a nuclear weapon .
Iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful .
" This is completely unacceptable , " said a European diplomat , who said discussions were under way in Brussels tonight to formulate a common response .
" They want to keep all the gains and give nothing away , " another diplomat said .
In public comments earlier Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president , gave the impression that progress was being made .
In a speech in the Iranian city of Mashhad , he said Iran was ready to cooperate , but not at any cost : " If you stretch your hand towards us honestly , we will press it .
But if there is any conspiracy , Iran 's nation will respond in the same way as it did to Bush and his likes . "
The other parties to the talks on the uranium exchange deal – the US , Russia and France – had confirmed their readiness to abide by the agreement , which would have involved shipping 1,200 kg of Iran 's low enriched uranium to Russia for further enrichment , and then to France to make the fuel rods , which would be used in the Tehran research reactor for medical purposes .
The US would upgrade equipment at the Tehran reactor .
Iranian officials had taken part in talks about details in Vienna last week , but then asked for more time for Tehran to consider the deal .
Tehran 's response was delayed six days , due to apparent uncertainty within the regime .
The IAEA issued a cautious statement today calling Iran 's proposals an " initial response " , and adding that the agency 's director , Mohamed ElBaradei , was talking to all parties " with the hope that agreement on his proposal can be reached soon " .
European leaders are due to hold talks with the Obama administration on the next steps on Tuesday , when Angela Merkel and the EU foreign policy representative , Javier Solana , are both due in Washington .
One possible compromise being contemplated tonight was for Tehran to put its enriched uranium in a secure site on Iranian soil , but under IAEA surveillance , until the fuel rods were ready for delivery .
But there appeared to be no workable compromise to Iran 's insistence on handing over the uranium in smaller batches .
Iran has also backed away from another undertaking made in Geneva , to meet before the end of the month to discuss its continued enrichment of uranium in defiance of UN security council resolutions .
The uranium exchange deal and Tehran 's apparent willingness to negotiate over its enrichment programme were seen as important diplomatic gains in Geneva after nearly four years of stalemate .
If the US and its allies decide that negotiations have run their course , they will begin to push for fresh UN sanctions at the security council .
European diplomats said tonight it would also become difficult to convince Israel that diplomacy was making progress .
A year and a half ago , TechCrunch editor Michael Arrington set out to build and sell a “ dead - simple Web tablet for $ 200 . ”
His reasoning :
There ’s a giant hole in the market for a computer bigger than an iPhone , smaller than an iMac , and meant to be used in a relaxed position and location , rather than typed at full - speed at a desk or on a handset .
Moreover , Arrington ’s coverage of startups and gadget makers convinced him that , despite his zero experience as a gadget maker , he could design a tablet , hire a company to build it , and then sell it through deals with big - box retailers and online stores .
The computer , named the Crunchpad , was scheduled to ship in time for Black Friday / Cyber Monday shoppers two weeks ago .
It would have been a great tale of how a journalist proved his own claims for the new rules of entrepreneurialism .
But at the last minute , Arrington posted on TechCrunch a claim that the production contractor , Fusion Garage — a 12 person company set up in Silicon Valley in February — had told him without warning that they and their investors had decided to sell the product themselves .
Arrington , according to email he posted from Fusion Garage CEO Chandrasekar Rathakrishnan , would be pushed aside into a marketing / evangelism role .
The Crunchpad was dead , he said .
Since Fusion Garage and Arrington ’s Crunchpad business co-owned the intellectual property for the device , the gadget would surely never ship to customers .
This morning , Rathakrishnan held a video conference to tell his side of the story .
( Smart move , appearing in person onscreen rather than as a distant voice on a phone call . )
Describing himself as “ an inventor ” rather than a businessman , he said , “ I ’m not the person I have been portrayed as in the blogosphere . ”
After a long background story about how and why he partnered with Arrington on the Crunchpad ( “ I guess I had him at hello ” ) , Rathakrishnan got down and dirty : “ Unfortunately , Michael was unable to deliver .
Michael was completely unable to deliver . ”
Rathakrishnan also criticized Arrington ’s Internet - celebrity approach to talking up the Crunchpad before its launch .
“ Publishing pictures of an unfinished product on a blog … is not a recipe for success , ” he said .
In Rathakrishnan ’s version of the story , Arrington spent his time blowing hot air about what he was going to do , while Fusion Garage did all the work to finish the design and build the product .
Enough gossip , let ’s skip to the product :
It ’s been renamed JooJoo — the URL is thejoojoo.com .
It ’ll cost $ 499 , it works over Wi-Fi only , and Rathakrishnan says the formal launch will be this week .
He ’s giving a video demo right now : “ It has the graphic power to deliver full HD video on the go . ”
It will also have built - in e-book capabilities , he said .
JooJoo is based around a 12.1 ″ touchscreen , the hardest part to build reliably according to Arrington ’s past posts .
Rathakrishnan ’s top selling point , though , is that JooJoo “ gets you onto the Internet faster ” by booting in 9 seconds , “ the fastest bootup sequence out there . ”
“ We do n’t boot to an operating system , ” he said .
“ We boot directly to the Internet . ”
The operating system under the hood is a Unix variant .
Pre-orders will be available beginning this Friday , December 11th .
Fusion Garage will also announce a new round of funding , on top of the $ 3 million the company has already raised from unnamed investors .
For now , JooJoo is one of those “ it remains to be seen ” stories .
Will Arrington stop Fusion Garage ?
Will the two parties reconcile in the interest of making some money and not ending as the Internet ’s latest FAIL tale ?
And if so , will enough customers spend five hundred bucks on one ?
Or will Apple debut its rumored tablet Mac and eat everyone ’s lunch ?
For at least the rest of this week , JooJoo speculation and rumor - mongering will be a news beat all to itself .
UPDATE : Mike Arrington responded on Twitter on Monday afternoon : “ There are n’t any more Crunch Pad posts coming from us .
It ’s all in the lawyers hands now . ”

1 m paying for homes by card
More than 1 million householders have used credit cards to pay their mortgage or rent in the last 12 months , a new survey by Shelter reveals today .
Despite restrictions on credit and reports of many people paying off personal debt , an exclusive YouGov poll for our ROOF magazine reveals a disturbing picture of over a million people taking desperate measures with credit cards to keep a roof over their head .
The highest proportion of those who pay their rent or mortgage through credit card were from working class professions ( 8 % of those in the C2DE social grouping ) , but the poll also showed that middle / upper class ( ABC1 category ) are falling victim , with 4 % of respondents saying they use credit cards in this way .
Many could find themselves facing homelessness this year because of their huge debts , especially as defaulting on credit card payments could trigger repossession in the worst case scenario .
The survey asked if respondents had paid their rent or mortgage by credit card in the past 12 months .
6 % of those who were liable for the rent or mortgage said yes – suggesting a national figure of more than a million people .
The charity is issuing a stark warning to people about the dangers of using credit cards which could result in the loss of their home .
Credit card companies have to recover their debts and are not subject to the same rules as mortgage lenders .
Once they obtain a charging order on people ’s property , credit card companies can go back to the court for a possession order to force a sale to recover the debt .
Kay Boycott , Shelter 's director of policy and campaigns said : ' This is a shocking discovery , that over a million households in Britain are in such desperate circumstances that they need to borrow money on credit cards to pay for basic housing costs .
' If people are already struggling to the extent that they fear losing their home , increasing credit card debt cannot be the answer . '
One of the biggest shocks is that 1 in 12 Londoners are resorting to plastic to pay their mortgage or rent .
Ms Boycott continued : ' It is absolutely vital that every single person using credit cards in this way seeks advice urgently to get the help they need to ensure they do n’t lose their home .
' Shelter has a network of advice services across the country who are ready to give free advice on a range of subjects including debt and housing issues so we would urge anyone struggling to get in touch today .
The sooner they seek help , the more options are available . '
Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com , said : ' Mortgages are a debt , credit cards are a debt .
For all but the seriously financially savvy , using credit cards to pay rent or mortgages is a mistake that can store up mammoth financial problems for the future .
If you ca n’t afford to pay your housing costs lumping up the borrowing is never the answer – far better is to seek help as soon as possible and start managing the problem .
' It ’s great to see housing charity Shelter adding to the weight of non -profit debt counselling help for those in crisis ; and I would urge anyone worrying about home - related debt problems to get in touch with them - it should stop a few sleepless nights . '

I 've ridden BMW 's new superbike , the S1000RR for two sessions here at Portimao , plenty of time to get a feel for the bike and here are my initial impressions .
Just sitting on the new BMW S1000RR makes me think of my long - term R6 .
I 'm five - foot eight / nine and it just fits me really well , everything is really light and compact .
It 's a pretty amazing piece of packaging , really .
Just moving it around on pit lane here at Portmão makes it feels like someone 's nicked the engine .
The BMW bloke in the pre-ride press conference encouraged us to do the first session in sixth gear at 2,000rpm as a way of demonstrating how smooth and tractable this engine is .
Personally I think it was just a way to ensure that none of us immediately chucked one on its roof in the expansive gravel traps .
For the few corners I did try this technique it really did show up the engine 's super - tractable , electric motor - like torque delivery and flexibility .
It 's really easy to flick from one bank angle to another ­ handy at this circuit because one corner just flows into another and really high speed direction changes are crucial .
The RR steers beautifully neutrally with pinpoint precision .
The bike runs massive ( biggest in class ) 46 mm forks and the feel and feedback from them is mint .
It feels closest to the last R1 , not the big - bang one , but the previous model , it 's not revvy like a Blade it 's not peaky like a ZX - 10 R , it 's smooth in the way it makes it power , like a big turbine , which makes it easy to ride hard .
I stiffened up the front forks in session two to minimise the weight transfer both on and off the brakes and it made a big difference to the turn -in .
I 've seen 280 kph on the clocks down the straight so far , in 5th .
More to come in the next session when I go out with Troy Corser and see what he 's got in his locker !
This is just a smal location for my team .
The game will be made remotely and sent in upon completion .
From the " 60 Minutes " interview :
Schmidt said he asked Palin about her serenity in the face of becoming " one of the most famous people in the world . "
He quoted her as saying , " It 's God 's plan . "
This , of course , is open to interpretation .
Is it an expression of religious and spiritual calm at a moment of high drama ?
Or is it exactly the use of religion to sanctify one 's own ambition and a dangerous fusion of divine will and human action ?
My view is a mixture of the two , if the quote is exactly accurate .
But both interpretations are more than a little troubling in a secular politician .
Palin is n't a minister or priest .
She is n't a bishop .
She is a celebrity , who spent ten minutes trying to run a state much bigger than Texas with the population of the District of Columbia .
When she says " it 's God 's will " , she is saying , it seems to me , either that her destiny is foretold as a modern day Esther ( which is a strong theme among her Christianist supporters ) ; or that it does n't matter what decisions she makes in office because God is in charge .
So she is either filled with delusions of grandeur and prone to say things that believing Christians keep private out of humility ; or she thinks she 's some kind of Messiah figure .

PHILADELPHIA – A teenage girl who appeared topless in a " sexting " cell phone picture that was distributed among her middle - school classmates should face child - pornography charges , a Pennsylvania prosecutor argued before a U.S. appellate court on Friday .
In the first U.S. case to test the constitutional status of " sexting , " the American Civil Liberties Union countered that the incident does not come close to meeting the definition of child pornography which typically depicts graphic sexual acts with minors and is done for commercial gain .
The ACLU also said the Wyoming County prosecutor erred when he threatened 16 teenagers with the felony charges unless they agreed to a participate in a " re-education " course on why sexting was wrong .
A three - judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals was considering a March 2009 court ruling that said the pictures , in which teenagers sent sexually suggestive pictures of themselves to their friends by cellphones or the Internet , fall under the U.S. Constitution 's free speech protections .
Officials of the Tunkhannock School District in rural northeastern Pennsylvania contacted the county prosecutor 's office in January 2008 after finding pictures on the cell phones of the 16 students .
Most of their families agreed to undertake a " re-education " program called for by the prosecutor , but three refused .
Prosecutors were seeking to press charges against one of the three girls .
Pictures showed two of the girls wearing white bras and another standing topless outside a shower with a towel wrapped around her waist , the ACLU said .
The pictures did not show any sexual activity .
MaryJo Miller said outside the appeals court on Friday that the picture of her daughter , who was wearing a bra , was originally taken in 2006 when she was 12 years old and attending a slumber party .
When she saw the picture , she thought the girls were " goofballs , " Miller told reporters .
" It was a training bra .
You are going to see more provocative photos in a Victoria 's Secret catalog . "
But the county argued that the pictures were pornographic because they were disseminated for the purposes of sexual stimulation and so would be of great interest to child molesters .
Appellate Judge Thomas Ambro said prosecutors are not entitled to try to " re-educate " minors .
" I do n't know of anything that allows the district attorney 's office to play the role of teacher , " he said .
The court is expected to rule within 90 days .
The most heart - wrenching thing in the world is getting dumped by someone you really care about .
I had my heart ripped out about 2 years ago and I still occasionally think about her and wonder what she ’s doing –you get over it , as I have , but you do n’t ever forget about them .
You really have to do all you can just
to keep yourself from breaking down and completely losing it , do n’t you ?
I understand .
Alright , I ’ve got some excellent advice for you here today about how to handle the tidal wave of emotions that you ’re overcome with and get yourself together so you can get back to being happy again .
But first , I feel as though a little bit of
dark humor is in order , have a look at this , have a laugh , and then continue below for the serious bit :
Right , I ’ve got a few tips for you first :
Do n’t hold it in , GET IT OUT .
Girls are actually better at this than guys are .
Girls will get all their girlfriends and have a
girl ’s night in where they all cry and boy - bash and drink and get all their feelings out , and then she ’ll start to feel a lot better because she has kind of gotten it out of her system , or started to at least .
Guys are weird about this ( I ’m a guy , I know ) , they ca n’t do that with their male friends , and therein lies the key : guys , listen to me , your female friends here are VITAL , because unlike with your guy friends , you can go to one of your female friends and cry , literally cry , on her shoulder .
You can get all those emotions out , swear her to secrecy ( and if she ’s a good friend that will be sufficient ) , and you will feel MUCH BETTER , I promise .
I ’m serious : I have done this , and it is a lifesaver .
You do n’t have to tell anyone else about it , but you have GOT to get those emotions out somehow .
30 days , NO CONTACT .
You ’ve probably heard this before but I ’ll say it again : stay away from your ex for at least 30 days , it seems like it sucks but it can prevent all kinds of horrible drama from occurring .
Do n’t give up on everything else you ’re doing : taking a short break for a few days is fine , but do n’t just stop working out and working on those projects that were important to you before you got dumped ; you might not feel like doing this stuff , but it will really help you feel better if you do .
That sense of purpose and accomplishment , plus the sheer distraction of it , can seriously help to keep you from going nuts and spiraling deeper into depression .
Start seeing other people , preferably sooner rather than later .
I understand that this is much easier for girls to do than guys , but honestly a little bit of random freaky - deekyness will help you get it into your head that there are actually other people out there who are attracted to you and you DO have other options .
Alright , now I ’ve got a video for you , and although it ’s sort of aimed at girls , it ’s just as helpful for guys ( she even later added a note to this video saying exactly that ) :
Additional Resources and Further Reading
For girls there are TONS of good books out there , the most popular currently being :
He ’s Just Not That Into You : The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys , as well as It ’s A Breakup Not A Breakdown and It ’s Called a Breakup Because It ’s Broken .
Guys , there just is n’t that much out there for us , which is horribly unfair , but something that ’s kind of indirectly related which I just finished reading and can highly recommend is For Men Only : A Straightforward Guide to the Inner Lives of Women – through hundreds of interviews and the results of a scientific national survey of women , this book demonstrates that women are actually not random and that they really can be systematized and “ mapped . ”
In fact , much to men ’s delight , this book shows that women are actually quite easy to understand and please — as long as you know what it is they need .
This simple map will guide you to loving your wife or girlfriend in the way she needs to be loved .
HelpGuide.org has got an excellent article on how to deal with a breakup , definitely worth reading .

But it was first of its kind , far more complex than previous methods , and ABI 's own literature on it skipped past key technical details — as a result , it confused most people .
When talking with several people involved in genome sequencing , none would let me finish the sentence " I do n't understand how SOLiD works ... " — they 'd all interrupt by saying " Nobody understands SOLiD sequencing . "
Fortunately , I have a friend at ABI , and I now understand it .
It 's really quite clever .
The process starts with a step that 's shared by the other two major sequencing techniques , which we 'll term tethered PCR .
Tethered PCR creates a small population of identical molecules to sequence , but keeps them in close physical proximity so that they can be sequenced as a group .
DNA on a bead
Miniaturization helped radically increase the rate of DNA sequencing , but it has its limits , the primary one being our ability ( or even a robot 's ability ) to accurately measure out the increasingly miniscule amounts of materials needed for ever smaller reactions .
Eventually , the accuracy plunges and reactions stop working because they do n't have the right ratios of ingredients .
The solution to this problem was to create a large reaction mix , and then use a physical - chemical process to split it up into reactions that are smaller than any human could accurately measure .
Two of the techniques ( SOLiD and 454 ) split up the reactions using an emulsion , which you may remember from high school chemistry .
When two liquids that are immiscible — oil and water , for example — get put together and shaken , the water will form tiny droplets in the oil .
In most cases , these droplets will quickly bump into each other , merge , and grow , separating the liquids out .
But , with specific types of oil , it 's possible to create a stable emulsion .
All you have to do is replace the water with a PCR reaction mix , and a decent sized emulsion will contain a staggering number of miniature PCR reactions , potentially one in each drop .
Of course , that does n't do you any good if you can't isolate the products contained in each individual bubble when the reaction is done .
That 's where tethering comes in .
Each PCR reaction still contains two sets of primers , but one of them is chemically linked to a tiny bead .
As the reaction proceeds and more of this primer gets used , the bead simply gets coated with DNA , keeping all the reaction products in one place , even when the emulsion gets broken up at the end of the PCR process .
The other primer is often linked to a chemical ( biotin , which will be familiar to the biologically inclined ) that can be used to separate beads covered with DNA from those that did n't participate in a reaction .
DNA fragments are ligated onto a primer - coated bead , then subjected to PCR , coating the bead with a series of identical molecules .
The other primers used in the PCR reaction have a molecular tag that enables successful reactions to be purified .
It 's worth pausing to think about the statistics of the reaction for a bit .
Any bead that started in a reaction with two different DNA molecules is useless for sequencing , since it will produce a mix of two signals .
As a result , the amount of DNA added to the reaction is controlled so that , on average , very few of the beads start with two or more DNA molecules .
At these levels , most of the reactions will be empty , in that they have no DNA to amplify .
( These empty reactions are gotten rid of by the purification step described in the last paragraph . )
Setting up things so that the majority of reactions are wasted probably seems like , well , a waste , but there are two things to consider here .
First , each reaction is so small that it uses very little material material , so this probably saves on materials in the long run .
The other thing is that the approach allows massive numbers of reactions to be set up in parallel with minimal human or robotic intervention .
Most of these reactions may be wasted time , but it 's still a net win , because the process completes more useful ones that we could do otherwise .
Going long with ligation
As we mentioned in our Complete Genomics story , DNA ligases only pay attention to when the five or six bases on either side of the link they 're making match .
In practical terms , this means that we can only sequence the five bases closest to the primer .
Since we can only distinguish about four fluorescent molecules easily , that means we can only examine one of these five bases at a time — repeated reactions are needed to get data from all five bases .
Complete Genomics got around the five - base limit by simply sequencing the closest five bases , then linking an unlabeled five - base sequence on , and sequencing the next five ; they stopped when they had 10 bases of sequence .
SOLiD takes a different approach , with ABI figuring that , if you 're ligating some bases on anyway , you might as well use those to extend the reads .
But nothing is simple when it comes to SOLiD , and ABI actually uses eight - base DNA fragments for each read step , which apparently increases the efficiency of the ligase reaction .
But it also creates problems .
If you read out from that primer , you 're only getting information about every eighth position on the DNA , making the data really sparse .
You also need to get rid of the label at the end of the DNA fragment to make sure you can read the next one .
The SOLiD technique has a simple solution : lop off the last three bases , and make the label go away with them .
In between the fifth and sixth bases , the primers contain a modified phosphate group , with a sulfur replacing one of the oxygens .
Adding a bit of AgNO 3 triggers a reaction that breaks the bonds at the sulfur , disconnecting the last three bases , which can be removed with a small bit of heating .
When they 're melted off , they take the label with them .
That leaves a five - base fragment behind , ready for extension .
Each SOLiD reaction involves a series of reactions in which every fifth base is queried ( vertical reaction cycle ) .
Five of these series are performed , each with a primer one base shorter than the last , to read all the bases ( horizontal reaction sets ) .
Repeating this process allows SOLiD sequencing to walk down the DNA , getting information about every fifth position .
ABI 's data shows that the accuracy remains high out to about 35 bases , and some preliminary data suggests it 's possible to go even further down the DNA .
Once the end of the read is reached , the sequencing hardware strips the newly added DNA off , and starts again with a primer that 's one base shorter , which gets information about the next base over .
Repeat this a total of five times , and every position on the DNA has been queried .
Double - checking base changes
That process is fairly hard to follow to begin with , but ABI 's real mind - bender is how it reads the information , as hinted at above .
As we saw with Complete Genomics , using four - color readouts nicely matches the four bases in DNA , allowing a single color to represent each base .
That may be the easiest way to think of things , but ABI would argue it's not the best way to actually perform sequencing .
A given color is compatible with four two - base combinations .
If we think of things in terms of information content , we 've got four fluorescent tags that are stable and easily distinguishable .
Since there are four bases , it 's easiest to simply match one color per base .
But it 's also possible to query two bases at a time — since there are 16 possible two - base combinations , each color has to represent four potential two - base combinations , as shown here .
Now , by itself , this is n't especially useful ; you may have narrowed down the identity of a given base , but you 've not definitively identified it .
SOLiD relies on having another two - base read that partly overlaps the first — obtained from a primer that was one base shorter — to nail a given base 's identity definitively .
Looking at it in terms of information again , given two overlapping reads , there are 16 possible two - color combinations , spread out over three bases .
Part of this information goes to definitively identifying the middle base ; the remainder provides some information about both flanking bases , but not enough to identify it definitively .
Only additional staggered reads will be able to nail their identities down .
The next issue is that , given the chart shown above and a series of colors , you 'll quickly find that there are always four sequences that are compatible with any given color series .
So , for example , given the series of colors below , it 's possible to assume the first base combination , indicated by blue , is AA .
The next combination is red and starts with A , so must be AT , the one after that is red and starts with T ...
But it 's just as likely that the first two bases were something else that causes a blue signal , which changes not only the first two bases , but every base combination afterwards .
A given series of colors is compatible with four different sequences , so knowing the identity of the first base is critical .
The problem comes from the fact that you can never firmly establish the identity of the first base you read using SOLiD data .
This may seem a bit useless at first , so it 's important to remember that the unknown sequence happens to be sitting next to PCR primers with a sequence that 's always known .
So , the trick is to always start the sequencing with at least one base of overlap with the known primer sequence .
If we know the primer ended with an T , then we know the sequence series must be the bottom one on this list .
Why use this mind - warping method of dealing with DNA 's information content ?
Because a lot of the sequencing that 's currently happening involves resequencing the human genome , looking for changes associated with cancer and genetic diseases .
In these cases , identifying single - base differences is critical , and having confidence that you 're not looking at a spurious sequencing error is essential for drawing any conclusions .
In every other technique , a single base difference will only change the signal at one point in the sequence reading process .
In SOLiD , because of the overlapping information , that base change will cause differences in two separate signals , read in completely different ligation reactions .
This provides a much higher confidence that any differences seen in SOLiD represent real differences in the underlying DNA sequence ; as a result of SOLiD 's built in error - catching , ABI estimates an error rate that 's well below that of any other system on the market , at least out to 25 bases .
Since most sequencing involves several passes at the same sequence , the ultimate error rate for a complete genome is extremely low .
ABI is obviously working on ways to extend the sequence reads but , even in its current form , SOLiD is more than capable of generating sequence that can be used to construct a human genome , given that everything can be aligned to known sequences .
Still , if researchers are willing to accept a higher error rate , there are new technologies that can take them out as far as four hundred bases in a single read .
Stay tuned for when we cover the catchily named pyrosequencing .
Russia and Georgia have agreed to reopen a border crossing that has been closed since July 2006 , Georgia 's foreign ministry says .
The Kazbegi - Upper Lars crossing is likely to reopen next March , deputy foreign minister Nino Kalandadze said .
It is the only crossing that does not go through the Russian - backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Georgian forces were driven out of the two regions in a bitter war with Russia in August 2008 .
The Russian government has confirmed the border agreement , saying that the checkpoint could " in theory " reopen from 1 March 2010 .
But air links could only be re-established if the safety of Russian air crews could be guaranteed , Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said .
Diplomatic relations had not been restored since the war , and that was the problem , he added .
The BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Moscow says there has been virtually no contact between Moscow and Tbilisi since the war , so the news that they are to reopen their border is a significant move , especially for the many Georgian and Russian families separated by the conflict .
But the hostility between the Russian and Georgian governments is unabated , our correspondent says .
Russia 's Sergei Ivanov on Thursday accused Georgia 's President Mikheil Saakashvili of behaving like the Afghan Taliban , after he ordered the demolition of a Soviet - era war memorial .
" Sky Grabber is offline satellite internet downloader , " the page begins confidently , at once informing the native English speaker that the page was n't written by one .
In fact SkyGrabber is a Russian programme – the site is apparently run by Cherkashyn Vyacheslav in Nab Podeba , Ukraine .
Sky Grabber is a simple enough concept : grab the signals that spill from a satellite broadcast ( or even narrowcast ) , aimed from a satellite towards a specific location , and turn them into TV feeds you can look at .
Or as the website puts it : " You do n't have to keep an online internet connection .
Just customise your satellite dish to selected satellite provider and start grabbing . "
The US drones would send their video up to a US military satellite ( the " uplink " ) that can not be intercepted .
The signal would then be beamed by that satellite or a linked one down to the controllers – who might be in Afghanistan or Iraq .
Because that signal was unencrypted , anyone who tuned their satellite dish to the correct frequency and location in the sky could pick up the signal , and decode it .
And because any satellite downlink signal spreads a little , the area where it can be picked up is potentially huge .
The weakness has been known for a very long time .
In February this year Adam Laurie , an " ethical hacker " who has spent a lot of time looking at satellite feed hacking , told the BlackHat conference that " anyone with a [ satellite ] dish can see data being broadcast " and that " things you would expect to be secure turn out not to be secure .
The most worrying thing is you can just see all this data going by . "
He has been at it since the 1990s – and in 1997 could see French TV reporters beaming back closed circuit coverage of Princess Diana 's death to the UK over unsecured feeds .
The only surprise is that the US army is surprised – given that it has known since the 1990s that the " downlink " ( from the satellite ) of the drone video was unencrypted .
The internet may have been invented in the US , but its knowledge has spread far and wide — and insurgents have used websites and computer networks to organise themselves for years .
The thinking of the author of SkyGrabber is clear enough , given the other products he touts : they include Tuner4PC – for establishing internet connections via satellite uplink and downlinks – and LanGrabber , which " intercepts network downloads started by other users and saves information on your hard disk " .
The latter is what hackers call a " sniffer " , seamlessly picking up the data that others are transferring and making a copy for you .
Over the past decade or so , divorce has gradually become more uncommon in the United States .
Since 2003 , however , the decline in divorce rates has been largely confined to states which have not passed a state constitutional ban on gay marriage .
These states saw their divorce rates decrease by an average of 8 percent between 2003 and 2008 .
States which had passed a same - sex marriage ban as of January 1 , 2008 , however , saw their divorce rates rise by about 1 percent over the same period .
The table below details the divorce rates for the 43 states that reported their divorce statistics to the CDC in both 2003 and 2008 .
It is calculated by taking the total number of divorces in the state that year , and dividing it by the number of married persons , as reported by the Census Bureau .
The result is then multiplied by two , since each divorce involves two people .
This is different than how the divorce rate is sometimes calculated , which may be as a share of the overall population rather than the number of married persons ; I prefer my approach because it will not penalize a state for having a lot of marriages ( and therefore more opportunities for divorce ) .
However , there are also more complicated versions of the divorce rate calculation that account for the age of the married couples , and so forth ; these are probably superior , but mine is intended to be a simple approach .
The table also lists the percentage change in the divorce rate between 2003 and 2008 , and the current status of gay marriage and domestic partnerships within each state .
As is somewhat visually apparent , those states which have tended to take more liberal policies toward gay marriage have tended also to have larger declines in their divorce rates .
In Massachusetts , which legalized gay marriage in 2004 , the divorce rate has declined by 21 percent and is the lowest in the country by some margin .
It is joined at the top of the list by Rhode Island and New Mexico , which do not perform same - sex marriages but idiosyncratically also have no statute or constitutional provision expressly forbidding them , as well as Maine , whose legislature approved same - sex marriage only to have it overturned ( although not banned constitutionally ) by its voters .
On the other hand , the seven states at the bottom of the chart all had constitutional prohibitions on same - sex marriage in place throughout 2008 .
The state which experienced the highest increase in its divorce rate over the period ( Alaska , at 17.2 percent ) also happens to be the first one to have altered its constitution to prohibit same - sex marriage , in 1998 .
Overall , the states which had enacted a constitutional ban on same - sex marriage as of 1/1/08 saw their divorce rates rise by 0.9 percent over the five - year interval .
States which had not adopted a constitutional ban , on the other hand , experienced an 8.0 percent decline , on average , in their divorce rates .
Eleven of the 24 states ( 46 percent ) to have altered their constitutions by 1/1/08 to ban gay marriage experienced an overall decline in their divorce rates , but 13 of the 19 which had n’t did ( 68 percent ) .
The differences are highly statistically significant .
Nevertheless , they do not necessarily imply causation .
The decision to ban same - sex marriage does not occur randomly throughout the states , but instead is strongly correlated with other factors , such as religiosity and political ideology , which we have made no attempt to account for .
Nor do we know in which way the causal arrow might point .
It could be that voters who have more marital problems of their own are more inclined to deny the right of marriage to same - sex couples .
There is , however , probably now enough data on this subject to engage in more sophisticated longitudinal studies on this subject ( more sophisticated than I have engaged in here ) , which might produce more robust conclusions .
Although only Massachusetts has affirmed gay marriage for any length of time , the difference between the states which have banned it constitutionally versus statutorily may be worth examining , as the former represents a significantly more confident assertion about the nature of state - sanctioned marriage .
At the very least , I would be surprised if there were any statistical evidence that interpreting the right of marriage to apply to same - sex couples would be injurious to heterosexual couples in any material way .
The New Zealand government has reintroduced its controversial " three - strikes " Internet law , Bill 92A .
Previously defeated after widespread outcry , the new 92A was introduced minutes before Parliament recessed for the holidays , and makes no substantial improvements over the initial proposal .
Under the revised proposal , if anyone in your house is accused of three acts of infringement ( without any proof of wrongdoing ) , your entire household loses stands to lose Internet access for six months , and / or pays a NZ$ 15,000 fine ( the previous version of the bill would have taken away your family 's internet for life ) .
The major change in the bill is the opportunity for a counter - notice , if you believe the accusation is false .
This " revised " law is still fundamentally flawed .
The two important mistakes that this law makes are :
1. Assuming that taking away your household 's Internet access is a just punishment for copyright infringement .
Even if you 're guilty of infringing copyright , kicking your family off the Internet is a punishment vastly disproportionate to your crime .
The Internet is increasingly tied to our earning power , our participation in civic affairs , our dealings with government , our education , and our connections to our community and families .
Taking away your Internet access does n't just deprive you of one means of copying movies or music : it could deprive your kids ' of their ability to complete their homework ; it could cost you your living ; it could exclude your family from civic affairs such as Parliamentary hearings , local council initiatives , etc , and impair your ability to interact with government services from health to building permits .
And , of course , it is fundamentally unjust to punish an entire household for the deeds of one person .
2 . It contains no real penalties for false accusations .
Earlier Internet copyright initiatives , such as the " notice - and - takedown " system for removing content from websites , have made no provision for punishment in the event of a false accusation of infringement .
In the absence of such penalties , companies and other rightsholders have treated these copyright laws are carte blanche to send out abusive , sloppy , or spurious notices , because the cost of their mistakes would be borne by ISPs and web - site creators .
The record on this is clear : giving one group of people the power to punish another group without penalty for abuse of this power leads to abuse .
As I 've pointed out here before , Universal Music would never go for this law if it cut the other way — if Universal stood to have all its New Zealand offices kicked off the Internet in the event that it makes three false accusations — but without some check on power , terrible abuse is inevitable
Update :
Thanks to commenter StuartM for pointing to a better source on the bill .
While the bill retains the two fatal flaws above ( collective punishment , no penalties for false accusations ) , it does contain some major improvements over the original 92A :
* Guilt must be proven to a copyright tribunal
* The definition of ISP has been narrowed to exclude universities , employers and other institutions that provide Internet access
* Rightsholders must pay a ( unspecified ) fee to file compliants .
Govt reveals revamped Section 92A

“ How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live . ”
– Henry David Thoreau
Earlier this week I published an article on “ Five Reasons Why Having A Blog Makes You More Productive . ”
However I also sometimes fear that blogging , or any writing for that matter , can also become counterproductive if it begins to take away time from other activities we could be taking part in .
The above quote by American writer and philosopher Henry David Thoreau sums up my feelings perfectly .
If we find that we are writing about the things we do more than we are actually doing them , then things can become problematic , unbalanced , and incongruent with our self - perception .
Therefore it is important that sometimes we put down our pens , shut down our computers , and go searching for what life really has to offer .
This has motivated me to put together a short list of some of the things we can do to correct this imbalance .
1. Pick Up A New Hobby
I do n’t care how old you are , unless you are on your deathbed there is no reason to not always be seeking new activities to engage yourself in .
Our time on this world is limited , but the kinds of things we could be doing within that time limit are endless .
Try to think of a friend who is well - versed in a subject or hobby that you may be interested in .
Maybe it is a sport like volleyball or golf , or maybe it is an activity like painting or photography .
Have your friend guide you through the first few stages of the learning curve until you become familiar with the fundamentals .
Once you have a good enough grapple with that you can continue pursuing the activity on your own .
2. Help Someone In Need
Doing things for others is one of the most underrated productive things you can do .
Not only are you making a difference in someone ’s life but you are going to feel infinitely better because of it !
Try to find a local volunteering organization , maybe a church , soup kitchen , or rehab center , and then see what you can do to help out the community .
Try to volunteer on a regular basis .
Even if it is only one hour a week it is still more than most , and you will still be playing your fair part in improving other people ’s lives .
3. Spice Up Your Living Space
There is always a good excuse to change up your living environment , even if it is just for the sake of change itself .
This does n’t mean you have to go to IKEA and spend money on colorful furniture , there are plenty of creative things you can do with things you can find lying around the house .
One of my favorite projects is to make collages out of old photos or magazines .
You can turn this into a frame to put on the wall or even a nice tabletop .
Think of your living space as a work of art .
Incorporate both creativity and personal meaning , but keep it tasteful for guests .
If you get too extravagant you may come off as a bit of a loony … but sometimes having fun is more important anyway .
4. Challenge Yourself
Deliberately find something that brings you out of your comfort zone .
The point of a challenge is to push you to the next level .
What is something you would n’t dare do ?
Maybe it is skydiving or that new roller coaster at Six Flags .
Maybe it is even approaching that new girl from work .
Whatever it is , “ Go Nike And Just Do It ! ”
You will feel better about yourself for pursuing the challenge , and you will be more inclined to face your fears in the future .
Make sure you find something that really gets on your nerves otherwise you are n’t challenging yourself enough .
5. Cook For A Friend Or Loved One
This is another nice thing you could do for someone else that will also benefit you .
If you already love cooking then maybe you have a favorite dish that you would like to share with someone .
If not then you can check out AllRecipes.com ( my personal favorite ) and find something that you wo n’t screw up .
It is also OK if you need an extra pair of hands to help you around the kitchen .
Remember this list is about standing up to live , not fending for yourself , so the ability to ask others for assistance is still an necessary part of any healthy living strategy .
6. Join An Activist Group
I am sure everyone can think of a particular cause that they would like support .
Nowadays there is an activist group for just about anything : animal rights , cancer awareness , fighting poverty , environmental issues , and protesting corrupt government institutions .
Take a moment and think of something that you would like to change about the world .
Then try searching for your cause on Google and see if you can find an organization that shares your beliefs .
It typically is n’t hard to find an outlet for any kind of social , political , economic , or environmental change , and most of these organizations are non-profit , thus they are willing to have just about anyone hop on board who wishes to show support .
7. Plan A Getaway
I use the term “ getaway ” here because vacations can be expensive .
Ideally you may want to visit Cancun and drink margaritas all weekend , but some of us are n’t always fortunate enough to have that option .
However , just because we do n’t have money does n’t mean we ca n’t escape from our same ol ’ daily routine .
Maybe there is a local beach or national park you could visit for the day .
Find the time to spend a long afternoon just outside and enjoying nature .
It is a great way to get in touch and remind yourself what you are really standing up and living for .
Also , how could I quote Thoreau and not recommend spending more time with Mother Earth .
Final Thought
Do n’t just sit down and wait to die !
Get up right now and find something that makes a difference in you and in others .
So you wanted to spend the weekend locked in your room writing another blog post ?
F— that !
Free yourself first .
Then you can write about all the rich experiences you had after the fact .
Have I gotten you inspired yet ?

VIEWPOINT
Richard Betts
Climate scientists need to take more responsibility about how their work is presented to the public , suggests the Met Office 's Richard Betts .
In this week 's Green Room , he says it is vital to prevent climate science being misunderstood or misused .
Individual weather events , from heatwaves to big freezes , cannot be used either to prove or disprove climate change
Recently , I gave a talk on climate change in my local village hall in Devon , and not surprisingly I was given a hard time .
In fact , it started two days before that .
Cut off from work by the snow ( which , incidentally , had been forecast with almost pinpoint accuracy ) , I was out with the kids and being teased by the other dads .
" Where 's all this global warming you 're always on about , ha ha ! "
The usual stuff , leading to the usual somewhat nerdy discussion on the difference between weather and climate , which was then cut short when one of the children crashed their sledge and asked if we had got that on video to send to a TV show such as You 've Been Framed .
Of course , we are seeing the same comments in some parts of the press and on Twitter , from those who jump on any bit of cold weather to say it proves that global warming is not happening and we 're all a bunch of idiots ( or worse ) .
No matter how many times we say that " global warming " means a rise of average temperature across the world , decade by decade , and not every year being consistently warmer than the last in every place on Earth , there are still those that get this mixed up .
Warming world
Yes , we have had the coldest December in the UK for 14 years and now we are having a big freeze in early January ; but the UK covers less than half of one thousandth of the Earth 's surface .
Climate data shows that human activities are warming the world
Journey through climate history
Last year was actually the fifth warmest year on record as far as global temperatures were concerned .
The four warmest years were , in ascending order , 2002 , 2003 , 2005 and 1998 .
The last decade was the warmest on record , followed by the 1990s and then the 1980s , so the world is definitely warming up .
To be fair , people often make the same mistake but in the other direction , and link every heatwave , major flood , drought and famine to global warming .
Of course , we know that these things happen anyway , even without climate change - they may happen more often under a warmer climate , but it is wrong to blame climate change for every single event .
Climate scientists know this , but still there are people outside of climate science who will claim or imply such things if it helps make the news or generate support for their political or business agenda .
Mixed messages Climate " sceptics " accuse climate scientists of exaggerating the evidence for human - caused climate change in order to secure their own funding ; but actually I think that any vested interests in talking up the problem lie elsewhere .
Individual natural disasters are not evidence of climate change
The focus on climate change is now so huge that everybody seems to need to have some link to climate change if they are to attract attention and funding .
Hence the increasing tendency to link everything to climate change - whether scientifically proven or not .
The question is : do climate scientists do enough to counter this ?
Or are we guilty of turning a blind eye to these things because we think they are on " our side " against the climate sceptics ?
It 's easy to blame the media and I do n't intend to make generalisations here , but I have quite literally had journalists phone me up during an unusually warm spell of weather and ask " is this a result of global warming ? "
When I say " no , not really , it is just weather " , they 've thanked me very much and then phoned somebody else , and kept trying until they got someone to say yes it was .
Talking up of the problem then gives easy ammunition to those who wish to discredit the science .
They do not care whether the wrong information came from the scientists or from a second - hand source , they just say ( quite rightly ) that it 's wrong and therefore why should they trust other parts of the science ?
Climate scientists need to take more responsibility for the communication of their work to avoid this kind of thing .
Even if scientists themselves are not blaming everything on climate change , it still reflects badly on us if others do this .
We cannot simply say it is everyone else 's fault ; we need to be very clear about what can be used as evidence for or against climate change .
Long - term , large - scale trends and the overall statistics of extreme weather events can and should be part of this evidence base .
Individual weather events , from heatwaves to big freezes , cannot be used either to prove or disprove climate change .
If we do not help the media , NGOs and the public to understand this , we have done nothing to stop them getting it wrong .
If our science is misunderstood and misused , and then turned against us , it really will be a case of We've Been Framed .
Dr Richard Betts is head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Dr Betts ?
Is climate science being used as a political football ?
Do scientists need to take more responsibility to ensure their work is correctly understood ?
Or is the difference of opinions about climate change the sign of a healthy democratic debate ?
Most climate scientists publish papers in peer reviewed journals .
Climate sceptics have less accepted theories that are not generally passed by the peer review process so they use the internet distribute their ideas .
People outside the academic community cannot gain access to the subscription only journals so a Google search throws up a disproportionate number of hits with convincing pseudo - scientific garbage .
Climate scientists have got to make their publicly funded research more openly and easily available .

It really does n't take a scientist to realize that the surface of the Earth is indeed warming over the past 15,000 years or so from the last glaciation era .
The fact that warming is in effect and has been for all this time is a fact .
What we are worried about is that humankind has increased the rate of warming .
That is highly speculative and so far indications point to a " probably " .
But by how much is very difficult to measure because we do n't have accurate records going back 500 or 1000 years .
Man 's contribution is definitely there , but we should be careful in thinking that we can influence earthwarming as much as many journalists try to convince us .
The extra CO2 in the atmosphere created by mankind may be detrimental to climate and to human health therefore reductions in CO2 levels will be good for our long term health .
We saw that with lead levels from gasoline .
When lead was taken out of gasoline , lead levels in blood decreased very quickly and people 's health , especially children , improved dramatically .
CO2 is a waste product in our bodies and extra injestion is not good .
We have not evolved the necessary biological processes to eliminate higher concentrations of CO2 easily .
We may , given millennia , but then again we may not .
Let 's err on the side of caution .

Whitehorse , Canada i am feeling very sad at the state of infomation thigs are now happing at great speed i beleive we are heading for a total change in global perspetive i believe within the next 2 yrs this planet will be shaken in a massive way some will survive meny will die lets not be nieve at what is comming at us soon this world needs to wake up dont blame people or what we are doing to the planet we cannot change the world not yet maybe them that survive will this 2012 thing i feel it to be very real lets be ready when i read about the glacias on everest melting not just the pola ice caps i fear for the people that live of india and the lower regions of the himalaias i see massive floods i am no educated genius as you can see but it dont take much to understand this world is on its last legs all i can say is brace your selfs and be ready i am saying this not to frighten any one i just want to make a point i love this world but the only thig i see is alot of sadness but we cant give up thats nature i am just sad that people are not looking at the whole picture God bless every one and this is real

While the argument about climate change is going on , the subject of the explosion of human population remains a taboo .
Like many species before us , humanity will collapse if it continue to breed out of control with the complete disregard to available resources .
Is there a common purpose to humanity or it is simply a sum of our individual aspirations ?
Is there such a thing as an optimal size of human population that will allow us to evolve as species but would not put unbearable strain on this planet , our only home ?
These are the questions that need answers .
SergeI Petrov , Pender Island , Canada
The responses here show just how much people are willing to misinterpret any attempt to be claer and ratioal about this .
It is a complex subject , and Richard Betts seeks to explain that and caution about the misuse by media on all sides but at the same states that it is clear that the evidence and science comprehensively supports man-made global warming .
Instead of actually reading that , a lot of the posts only pay attention to the bits they want to hear , and say " he admits its all media hype " - that is NOT what he says , and to claim so is fundamentally dishonest - and stupid !
If you make obviously wrong and distorting statements then who do you think you are actually helping - you are destroying the credibility of any argument you might have .
For thise who say " why do n't we see more climate skeptic views in the green room " the answer is that the green room is science based and the science overwhelmingly supports the man made warming position .
There is no solid evidence or theories currently available that actually supports the skeptics - so there is nothing that is really science to write about here .
If you think otherwise then Publish the data and science , not just vague statements with no evidence .
Peter Clarke , Auckland , NZ Sigh ...
In Northern Hemisphere we are having the coldest winter in years , meanwhile in the Southern hemisphere 9ie Australia New Zealand etc ) they are having the hottest summer in years .
Go figure ...
Please note it 's GLOBAL CLIMATE INSTABILITY that is the issue .
Also last summer ( northern hemi ) / winter ( southern hemi ) it was the reverse situation .
We need to look at the long term trends .
Richard Arnold , Austin , TX , USA Firstly , every time i hear ' its weather , not climate ' i think yes , but the climate is made up of weather , global weather , upon which trends can be established .
With 2008 the coldest this decade , and winter 2009 / 10 shaping upto be the coldest globally for a generation ( including china , and the US suffering cold snaps ) this does have a bearing on the AGW thesis , as it a highlights a cooling trend which now goes back 12 years .
The AGW thesis is flawed , it is a totally untestable based on a ' weak correlation = causation ' argument anyway and should have been disregarded years ago .
However careers now depend on it and it will be defended literally to the death by many regardless of how much the evidence goes against it .
John Bailey , manchester
It does n't matter how good your communication skills are , the ' conspiracy theory / climate denier ' gang will never hear you .
Unhampered by the democratic requirement to take heed of idiots , the Chinese are greening their economy by trawling the world for the best technologies .
Violent swings in the climate are powerful drivers of evolution - a sea change is about to happen in the distribution of economic power .
Geoff Dalton , Napier New Zealand
I really can't believe people are still denying the environmental damage that is going on right under our noses .
It is really time to wake up .
You have only to go to places like South & Central America or south east Asia to see the massive deforestation that is going on first hand .
We are heading toward a complete ecological melt down .
Species are disappearing in huge numbers and we seem to be polluting every corner of the planet .
Deny climate change all you like but the planet is a very polluted place you only have to open your eyes and take a walk to see it for yourself .
Gavin Sparks , surrey , england
We need to take the scientists who warn us of climate change seriously because the consequences of any change could be very serious indeed .
In the distant past people could adapt to climate change , or they could up sticks and move .
They could do this because populations were small and the world was large .
But our present world population is so huge , particularly in our cities , that we cannot move or change our way of life easily .
The space no longer exists .
If any major climate change disrupts the functioning of our cities , there would be economic collapse and no means of escape for the countless millions left in a hostile environment .
For us to survive , everything , from the jobs we have to earn our money to the supermarkets we buy our food from , has to function as well as we can achieve .
So lets stop the silly blather about which side of the argument is right or wrong , and just understand that a possible threat to our civilization has been identified , and take it seriously , !
so that we can work out how to avoid disaster if at all possible .
Patrick Sweeney , London , England Interesting article , while linking one off events to either prove or dis - prove global warming is not helpful , even more helpful would be for climate scientists to be clear about what it is , is it global warming or not as the term climate change can cover every type of weather event possible .
The other way that the debate could be helped is if that anybody who does n't agree with the man made global warming lobby is n't treated like a small child who just does n't get it .
A lot of people get it very well , they just do n't agree with your poor science and particularly the spurious links to human activity , it 's not the way the message is being understood that 's the problem , it 's the core work itself that 's flawed and starting with a premise that " humans are to blame , lets prove it " .
Patrick Bramman , Leicester To " Mardin M , Manchester " " Look at the poles .
They are melting should they melt ?
According to the history they were always cold , and now they are melting for some reason . "
The actic region had less ice on it 1300 - 1000 years ago than it does now .
Did the Vikings drive SUVs ?
" Its getting warmer , colder , the climate is CHANGING .
FACE IT . "
You 've not done your homework .
FACE IT .
Robert Leather , Manchester To Steven Black , Sydney , Australia " The IPCC comprised thousands of scientists from around the world who concluded that the world is warming and that the change is probably being caused by human activity .
"
Actually , if you 'll bother to check the details .
The IPCC did n't contain " thousands of scientists " it was a lot fewer than a 100 .
The remaining " thousands " were made up of regional and national policy makers and politicians .
Not scientists .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is primarily a political organisation to promote the understanding of climate change .
Robert Leather , Manchester I began reading this article and immediately thought " Here we go , another piece of warmist apologia , going on about " weather " v. " climate " , etc. " .
However , fair dues , he makes good points about the ludicrous over - selling of climate change in the media ( let 's be clear , in my view the BBC is a major culprit of this ) .
My only quibble with the article would be this : why wait until now to make these valid points ?
The outrageous misrepresentation of climate change in the media ought to have been challenged by the likes of Mr. Betts long ago ...
Why were you silent when it appeared that random weather events were being systematically linked to " global warming " ?
One final point : why does the " Green Room " never give space to articles from " global warming sceptics " ?
Where is the platform for these views on the BBC ?
The odd reader 's comment sneaked at the bottom of the usual " warmist " article is not enough .
Wang , brussels , belgium I think there are many journalists out there who do n't get things mixed up , but positively print outragious stories in order to gewt noticed and make a name for themselves .
They may live to regret it in old age when they sit there admiring their awards for this or that story , sweltering in 50 degree celcius temperatures awaiting the arrival of the next hurricane !
steve , Cannock
One commenter notes it 's cold all over this winter .
Not so .
In vast areas of Eastern Canada it has been warmer than usual .
Temperatures have been about 15C above normal in parts of Labrador so far in January , and here in New Brunswick the average daily max temp is over 5C above normal and night min temp , more than 10C above normal .
In large parts of the world , population density is low and so is media interest in those areas .
Attempting to draw conclusions about global temperature trends based on popular media coverage does not work well .
Rob Hughes , Fredericton , NB , Canada Dr Richards
Betts , head of climate impacts has presented a lot of logistic points in his article and I am giving him thanks .
No , climate science is n't being used as a political game .
It is really a big problem in the world .
From very beginning , when , science has started its journey , then , there were a lot of misconception raised like this .
Not only was that , Scientists were hurt by the fool people .
But , science was not changed .
Rather , science has been explored its jurisdiction .
It is pure and it could not be changed .
Definitely , Climate scientists need to take more responsibility to ensure their work is correctly understood and presented to the public .
At present , people are having a big freeze in early January and made some such comments .
And it is happened only due to the lagging of communication with the public
Engr Salam , LGED , Kushtia , Bangladesh
Thank you , Mr Betts , for something that has needed to be said for far too long .
Yes , you are absolutely right : global warming has become little more than a huge global political football .
It has gained so much momentum that it's now impossible for anyone - including scientists - to make any statement that appears to even slightly contradict the hyperbole of the politicians , journalists , and other AGW alarmists and extremists .
David , Cheshire I find it rather saddening that Joe Public feels somehow qualified to comment in this kind of forum on the validity of scientific research , simply because he 's ' seen a lot of TV shows ' .
If what climate - change scientists learn makes us unhappy , we can't just shake them up like a magic 8 - ball in the hope a more pleasant answer will bob to the surface .
We believed them about smoking causing cancer , the depletion of the O - zone layer and Amazonian deforestation - what 's the big leap of faith here ?
Typically , we only believe scientists when the lifestyle change they insist we make is one that is relatively simple and convenient .
When it comes to scrapping our car , we 're all suddenly sceptics .
Jack , Beijing , China
The IPCC comprised thousands of scientists from around the world who concluded that the world is warming and that the change is probably being caused by human activity .
People are entitled to their own views but unless we claim to know more than the acknowledged experts we should listen to them .
Judging by the comments to this article , scientists need to do a better job in communicating the consensus view .
Steven Black , Sydney , Australia
This article is one big step for both the BBC and the Met Office - an aknowledgement that many AGW ( anthropagenic global warming ) believers routinely link as many weather events as poosible to AGW - cold weather being about the only one you can't ( except those who link it to a Gulf Stream switch - off ) .
Now the BBC / Met need to keep this ' balance ' going .
Honest science is more valuable than scaremongering .
Perhaps there are more important proven concerns to spend our time and money on than this theory .
( malnutrition , poverty , lack of clean drinking water , etc , etc )
oakwood , UK No offence to Dr. Betts , but it is worth noting that his job title is " Head of climate impacts "
graham chambers , Luxembourg
The reason Dr Betts is pushing the assertion that climate change is anthropogenic ( in response to allan jones ) , is because among the academic scientific community , the debate on this topic is in the past .
More than 95 % of the scientific community are unanimous in their belief in climate change , and climate change caused by humanity .
The science academies of the world , the Royal Society in the UK and its peer bodies in every other nation all agree on this .
It is only among non-scientists that this is a debate at all , and this is because of the fact that scientists are being misrepresented or misquoted or are not taking care to ensure that their message gets across accuartely , as Dr Betts acknowledges .
If you pick up a science journal or a popular science magazine , you will find that column inches contesting climate change are as plentiful as those on the literal truth of the virgin birth .
As long as we , the non-scientist public , continue to take our scientific ' conclusions ' from bloggers , politicians , and fossil fuel lobby groups , we will continue to be misinformed .
Graham , Sydney , Australia
The main problem is that climate science has become showbiz .
The calm study of climatologists such as Perry and Perry , H H Lamb or D Q Bowen has been surpassed by celebrity climate .
You only have to look at the way the weather forecast changes almost by the minute in this cold spell to see why the public are dubious of weather or climate forecasts .
It is my opinion , that whatever the real reason for a changing climate , the overuse of lazy and readily available data churned over by robotic models always errs on the catastrophic .
Unfortunately , Mr Betts , the Climategate Scandal , the antics of Ethical Man and the current investigation by the BBC Trust into bias , shows that you have a long way to go to recharge the confidence of the public .
In essence climate or weather forecating is as much an art as a science - live with it .
Trefor Jones , Resolfen
In recent times , every patch of " unusually " hot weather ( or stormy weather , or many other kinds of weather ) has been followed by a chorus of claims from environmentalists that this constitutes proof of global warming .
I have never seen a single climate scientist then rush to say that the unusal weather in fact proves nothing because there is a difference between climate and weather .
Why are we only seeing this now , when the unusual weather appears to go the " wrong " way ?
It suggests a lack of objectivity .
As a professional scientist , my feeling is that the leaked CRU emails reveal a pathology in the science supporting the existence of significant anthropogenic global warming .
The scandal has irreparably damaged public confidence in the argument , and rightly so .
What we need is not more explanations to ensure that the science is better understood , but more and better science .
Instead of patronising articles on the difference between climate and weather , we need clear explanations of , say , the data selection used in the tree ring surveys conducted by CRU , the occurrence in the past of very high atmospheric CO2 levels with low global temperatures , and so on .
The public is neither as stupid nor as ill - informed as climate scientists appear to think .
Peter Weinberg , London , UK I suggest that something easily understood needs to be used and publicised as an indicator of global warming be it a natural cyclic phenomenon or indeed the result of human activity , current readily available information fails to convince many with no headline information as to where the headline figures came from or were developed .
Temperature probes between 1 and 1.5 metres below soil level in green field areas , normally undisturbed over many years should be able to demonstrate an upward trend in temperature over the years ( should this be so ) with a smoothed value showing little reaction to short term weather related phenomenon .
Probes would need to be all over the world to avoid influence from variation due to changes in regular wind patterns and ocean currents .
Perhaps this has already been done or is in progress but I have never seen any reference to such in the normal general news outlets .
Ian Coton , Penang , Malaysia
Can you really blame the free thinking people in the world for being " sceptics " ?
Lets take the science away for a second and just look at this from another point of view .
I am a keen follower of this whole environment debate , I 'll absorb anything I can get my hands on which relates to the environment and climate change .
One thing which I 've noticed happening more and more is the inconsistency in information given to us by the " non-sceptics " or " government funded scientists " ( basically scientists which relate everything to the warming of the planet for funding ) .
Let me give you an example ; the past few summers , the UK has seen large amounts of flooding in urban areas which the media and " non-sceptics " openly link to the warming of the planet and not because these places are built on flood plains to save cash .
Now I 'm sure most people would agree that rain can be described as " weather " and not " climate " .
So then why is it when the entire northern hemisphere cools down for a few months it 's put down to " weather " and not " climate " ?
I 'm not trying to preach that we dont have something to do with the warming of the planet , because we clearly have .
CO2 does have some effect on the Infra Red radiation from the sun trying to leave our atmosphere .
But the question which they still wo n't answer is how much of an effect ?
And also what else contributes to this warming ?
This begs the question about the computer simulated climate models which are the talk at the moment ( it does sound impressive though does n't it ) .
If I could ask the creators of these models one question , it would be this .
If you cant accurately predict the climate for next year , or even next month using man made climate models , then how am I supposed to believe you can predict the climate for the next 100 years ?
You have to question their motives .
Jason Howmans , Staffordshire , UK People keep mixing up ' weather ' and ' climate ' .
The problem is not that climate change happens , of course it does , but it is happening too quickly for many ( poor ) human and wildlife populations to be able to adapt successfully for long term survival .
The human race once acted successfully to stop CFCs from creating irremediable holes in the ozone layer - pity that it has n't proved possible to have the same ' can do ' attitude about greenhouse gases .
Ref global warming : people are wrong when they confuse ' average ' temperature rise with real temperature rise on the thermometer .
You can have heatwaves and big freezes , and temperatures may vary as much as 10 °C during a single day - that 's just weather .
But 'average temperatures are taken across the planet , and there are millions of readings , which is why huge computers are needed to crunch the data ; a 0.5 °C average temperature rise over a decade or so is very serious indeed .
But non-scientist general public does n't see that because he does n't want to .
Caroline W , Brussels , Belgium Fair minded and interesting
But yes still pushing global warming based on a long term trend .
The Mets seasonal forecasts are poor because they are based on that model and most conform it appears to the politics of AGW
So they are as guilty as anyone of confusing the public as to what is weather versus climate !
No more global warming politics dressed as seasonal weather forecasts please !
Paul kerr , Belfast
What temperature should it be ?
If people die because it is freezing everywhere , is that worse than people prospering because it is warmer ?
Can you say it was a bad year in 2020 because we had to burn the garden fence in July because we were freezing ?
Then Granny and Grandad died of hypothermia because it was .7 degrees colder in December but we had no electricity because we could not use coal to heat our home ?
ADAPT - humans did it in the Mediavel Period - they can do it in ANY PERIOD !!!
Do n't get wrapped up in the science .
Thorne , UK Henrik Svensmark at the Danish Space Centre Climate Research Unit is correct in his assertion and research that demonstrates a correlation between inevtible global climate change that has been going on over the last 100,000 years .
In short change the debate to SUSTAINABILITY given the fact that it is Nature & Man who is responsible for what is happening around the globe .
Given the doubling of human population in the next 50 years and diminishing resources why do n't we figure out how to make food , shelter , energy and continued purpose for humanity versus the terrible prospect of humans slugging it out when collapse happens .
The prospect of a science fiction " Soylent Green " ending is not a pretty prospect .
Time for us to move to sustainability for all .
David F Pawlowski , Michigan USA
Dr Betts says current UK weather was " forecast with almost pinpoint accuracy " .
Sorry , I believe they forecast a mild and warm winter ( ref WeatherAction.com ) as they also did ( incorrectly ) for 2007 and 2008 .
But that is besides the point .
As we know , when it 's warm that 's climate .
When it 's cold that 's weather .
Martin Judd , Melbourne , Australia
Another huge problem is that the " science " on global warming is locked away in science journals behind hugely expensive paywalls .
Please .
I could feed a family of 4 for a month on what it takes to access just a few articles .
You will NEVER reach the public that way .
WAKE UP AND SMELL THE OPEN ACCESS !
Ann Z , Aurora , IL USA Good article .
However , a few points do need to be made .
We know the difference between weather and climate , but on numerous occassions , the weather ( indeed famine , flood and drought ) have been used to confirm possible global warming , contary to the articles early statement .
The met may not say it directly , but their masters , the politicians do indicate a connection between weather , famine , floods etc to the GW theory .
We do hear it all the time .
The article is right about clearer communication to make the science better understood , but this means ensuring the interpretation of the data can be explained in many ways .
( I think politician and the media assume the public is not very intelligent .
The public are more intelligent than most politicians and media reporters .
Richard Black has shown lack of foresight on many occasions . )
Politicians do not understand the science any better than joe public , their job is to make policy based upon the science .
The recent article about 800,000 years of CO2 is an example I can refer to where the implication of Richards message was in stark contrast to what the data was telling me .
I think if the global warming issue is not rammed down peoples throats and the science is explained subjectively then people may start to listen more .
Sustainability has it benefits .
Push for low energy consumption and renewable resources etc but is there a need to tax people for excessive CO2 .
( That I believe is still up for debate ) I am not a global warming denier or otherwise .
I believe global warning is natural , but man made GW is not conclusive .
But I believe in sustainability and the appropriate use of resources to prevent pollution , deforestation etc .
Nicholas Mills , adelaide , Australia I do hope your anti natural resource people are shivering in the dark during your current period of global warming
Phil , Houston Texas
The ignorance in some of these posts is breathtaking .
For God 's sake , READ THE SCIENCE , and do n't post anything till you 've understood it .
Mr Henderson , Teddington , UK
The world is a business , science is part of this world so too needs to be marketed correctly .
I have never thought about it like this , what a weird world we live in .
Martin , Leeds , England Dr , Betts , along with others here , make many valid points , but what really sets me against the whole notion of global warming , is the way in which Met .
Offices have been hijacked as the weather wing of governments and used thereafter for their own political agendas .
I cannot accept that medium term ( how long exactly ? ) forecasts are little more than guesswork Alan , as we were making reasonably accurate long term forecasts in determining our strategies during the second world war .
The Met office , and their technologies have undoubtedly come a long way since then .
Whilst we ought to recognise the significance of their findings based on their technologies , what we ought not to do is state categorically , in the absence of equally firm evidence , that these changes are as a direct result of human activity .
People are now rightly disenchanted with the significant amount of political interference in their lives , and this serves as another good example of how governments ought not to handle , far less politicise what may , or may not prove to be a relevant issue .
Robert Brown , Carnoustie Scotland Allan Jones , Warrington , takes an all too common stance - these things are not well understood , there has been climate change before , scientists are not agreed , it is some kind of conspiracy to scare people .
Climatologists worldwide are almost universally agreed that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide , caused by mankind , is causing extremely rapid climate change ( rapid compared with fluctuations over the life of the planet ) .
Yes , the process is complex , yes , there is much more yet to be understood .
But this is no conspiracy to " scare " people off usng fossil fuels .
And the inability to predict local * weather * over a relatively short period has little to do with predicting global * climate * over a rather longer period .
The real fear is that massive and catastrophic warming could be unleashed by the release of enormous quanitites of methane as the tundra thaws out .
If that happens to any appreciable extent , we could well be talking of global baking .
JOHN WARD , Bideford , UK I do find it disturbing that ' weather ' is in fact often pointed to as evidence of global warming , when as Dr Betts says no such claim can be made .
Worse , I find it disturbing that filters are applied to temperature data without clarifying the assumptions such filters hide .
For example the ' annual average ' seems to be ' halfway between max and min for each day , averaged over a month , weighted by the distance between local weather stations , with the 30 - year such average subtracted , averaged for all such data points , then with a 9 - year ( or sometimes 13 - year ) binomial filter applied ' : this is a set of ( often non-linear ) filters , each of different type , that are signal - dependent in their effect , yet I see very little discussion of such basic signal processing in terms of sampling theory and linear systems modelling .
For a very simplified example of why this matters , if you take a 9 - year average then you will never ever see any cycle whose period is 9 years .
When you filter data , you impose your assumptions about how the data behave : you can only do so with impunity if you can identify those assumptions and justify them .
It is therefore a pity that these algorithms seem to be kept secret , and I do not understand why this would be done .
Chris Bore , Woking
An article driven by frustration and need to tell the story .
All the more sad to need to tell him ; " look up from this one little tea cup and see the bigger storm " .
Climate change is only symptom , and focusing on it distracts us from the real problem ;
The problem is too much Human Activity ( Number of individuals ) x ( Individual Impact )
We are ripping up the planet faster than it can cope ; that 's the real problem .
And , for all this guy 's clearly spilled frustration ; we are now talking to the wrong people .
However passionate and noble ; climate scientists are the wrong people to talk to from here on .
Yes they can give us blow by blow accounts of one symptom ; they can tell us how bad its getting .
But they can't fix the fundamental problem .
To fix the mess we are plunging into , we need to go and talk to the guys on the other pages of the BBC website .
We need to walk across the hall and go shake hands with the guys in grey suits .
If we want to save the human race ; the tie - dye , happy - clappers have to stop wringing their hands , and they will have to go shake hands with the guys in red braces .
It 's time to go talk to the guys who are getting us deeper and deeper into this mess ;
Those guys who sold us the dream of the Emperors New Clothes ; " more more more " For all this chap 's obvious frustration with the cheap jokes at his professional expense ; this is really a trivial side show detail ;
The thing we need to know is how much faster the " more more more " guys intend to rip up what 's left of Planet Earth .
A climate scientist is frankly out of that loop .
They are logging what happened .
For 2010 , we need what the guys in suits have planned ; they are the ones that are getting us deeper and deeper into this mass extinction .
We need to know their plans .
How fast do the marketing guys intend to rush the 2 billion low - impact people , across to join the 2 billion people on this high - impact side of the boat , and capsize the whole thing over ;
What 's the time scale for doubling Human Activity levels , and the damage being done to the planet , guys ?
3 years ? . . . 2 years ? . . . 18 months ?
That 's the question we need answering , and a weather scientist with a thermometer is the wrong guy to ask about that .
A heartfelt piece , written by a nice bloke . . . but sadly in the wrong part of the loop .
Sorry Steven
Steven Walker , Penzance I think this is a fair minded comment I 'm glad the problem with the media misrepresenting science is highlighted .
I think the Met Office should give up long term forecasts .
If the models they are using are based on global warming this will increasingly represent a poor forecast ( as they are based on long term averages designed to make a pollitical point ) .
Promises of barbecue summers and mild winters are also confusing climate with the weather
Paul kerr , Depressing reading ( the comments as much as the article ) .
Lets put it this way - Global Warming happening & we no nothing = Major Problems Global Warming happening & we make changes =
We have a chance No Global Warming & we do nothing = No Change No Global Warming & we make changes = some upheaval , cheaper / renewable energy for all , job creation , cleaner air etc etc Sorry but its really a no brainer
Kat , Lincs I really am unsure about climate change and find the nit-picking ( on both sides ) rather hypocritical .
Yes , we must n't read too much into recent and local weather , but the pro-warming group continues to quote data for the last 20 or 30 years ad nauseam .
What about the last 8000 years or so ?
Do you really think there are no other valid scenarios ?
Could we be totally wrong ?
Skeptic , Bognor Regis
I hate to break it to you , but the cold is not just in the UK .
It 's in China , Russia , USA , North Korea , and on and on .
There is record cold over much of the world right now .
It 's even cold in Miami , Florida !
Clint , Medina , TN
That 's a good article .
For the sake of an objective post , I 'm not going to state my own view .
The main issue with climate science is that it's not simple - it 's hideously complicated , and many people on both sides of the debate are using the issue as a political or professional tool .
The only way to combat ignorant assumptions is with clear science and transparant research ; and acknowledgement of the fact that pretty much any science is incomplete .
Luke Kavanagh , Cheltenham , England
It 's funny how a cold winter is proof of nothing but a couple of hot summers and it's the end of the world ?
David , London
It is tempting to blame climate change when there are warmer than normal weathers .
But still , it is pretty abnormal to have winter starting without snow and snow melting early .
Even though we have lots of snow and freezing this year , the year was otherwise warmer than normal .
There are not only weather and climate , but also different kinds of cycles .
We can blame cycles too .
But if it is cold cycle and it is still warmer than normal , then something should be wrong .
Also winters were colder and had more snow when my grandfather was younger .
Having lots of snow starts to feel more like an exception than the norm .
Hard to say what is correct , though , I am not an expert .
Suomalainen , Tampere , Finland I do n't understand , even if you ignore the recent months , there still has n't been any statistically significant globally averaged warming for 15 years !
We are all just pagan weather - worshippers making sacrifices to our weather gods !
Will we ever learn ?!

On the one hand I agree with Dr Betts - scientists do need to make their work far more public .
On the other hand I have to say I am now a confirmed climate skeptic - confirmed not by so much by the claims of Phil Jones et al , but by the extraordinary extent to which the ' hockey team ' went about keeping the information to themselves ; the flawed peer - review sytem ; and their attempts to discredit ( and threaten ) those who would question their methods and conclusions .
The e-mails are , quite simply , mind - boggling ...
In a sense the whole concept of the IPCC is wrong - ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate CHANGE '- surely that implies an assumed outcome ..?
Would n't .. Climate RESEARCH ' be better ..?
The whole process has been far too politicised for a balanced view to emerge - and has just given every government on the planet the excuse to increase tax .
I would also question the assertion that the past few years are the warmest ' on record ' - what happened to the 1920's / 30's ..?
What about the famours ' Medieval Warm period ' ..?
Surely Dr Betts is not falling into the trap of only considering temperature records since 1960 ..?
David Simmons , Cambridge I completely agree with Dr. Betts , being from the US not only do I get the wonderful opportunity to see some of the worst journalism available in the developed world but also a democratic system that has a dualism fetish that undoubtedly covers the climate issue .
The lack of knowledge between both the journalists and the public only creates democratic debates involving points of views that often is misinformed , partly true , or fallacy .
It would be nice if the issue , needless to say quite an important one , be understood by a greater portion of our population , our journalists and news teams , and politicians alike rather than ignorant arguments , spoon fed simplifications , and democrats and republicans taking sides on an issue that deserves to be considered on the same level of importance as national security , not abortion , gay marriage , etc .
It is , however , a complicated issue to fully grasp .
Although there are simple truths that get thrown around and perhaps the basic concept is understood , but they hardly explain the full scope of what has / is happening , and what needs to happen in order for us to stabilize or reduce CO2 emissions .
Unfortunately it may take more extreme climatic events for us to believe that human caused climate change is causing a host of environmental problems , but until that happens , enjoy the showcase of ignorant ideas from some of the less than savvy cretans that somehow found their way onto an American media platform .

Most people know that the world is getting slowly warmer and do not dispute the scientific fact of Global Warming .
It just becomes much harder to sell this fact to the general public when you 're skating into work every morning .
John , Craigavon
For the last eleven years the global temp .
has been decreasing .
The polar bear population has been increasing for the last 20 years and now NASA says they miscalculated the ice cover in the arctic .
There is a much ice there as there was in 1979 .
1998 was not the warmest year on record .
1934 was .
Global warming in a religion not a science .
It 's based on faith not fact .
Dr. J. S. Zannucci , Knoxville , USA I do n't think scientists need to take more responsibility to ensure their work is correctly understood .
I think they need to take more responsibility to ensure that their work is correct .
michael e forster , lewes , de usa I do not agree with Dr. Betts .
It is true that there is a climate change we all know that but we just do n't want to admit it .
For example Poland is a country which winters are very bitter .
Last year there was no snow .
This year its the opposite .
I just ca n't understand Dr. Betts .
Look at the poles .
They are melting should they melt ?
According to the history they were always cold , and now they are melting for some reason .
Its getting warmer , colder , the climate is CHANGING .
FACE IT .

I have watched numerous television programmes about the effects of climate change .
Most have predicted warmer wetter summers and shorter colder winters due to the gulf stream changing course .
It 's not that the information is n't out there , its that people are selective about what they take in .
As a result the general media are selective about what and how they report things .
It 's created a sort of self sustaining reaction .
It 's also worth pointing out that a few months ago there was reporting that the Sun 's solar activity had been decreasing for the last ten years , that this was a regular thing and had resulted in very cold winters in the past .
To the point the Thames froze .
Lots of astronomers were interviewed and it was very interesting .
As far as I can see the media has completely forgot about this .
I not saying that the current cold snap is a result of it , but it would be nice to have some debate about it .
Justin Ellis , Bangor , Co. Down Dr Betts makes a lot of good points , and yet still manages to push the assertion that climate change is human - centric .
However , that 's far from being proven .
I 'm not saying that human activity has no effect by any means , but climate change is a natural process that has occurred many times before ( e.g. ice ages , farming in greenland ) .
Does this mean that we should n't do anything ?
No , of course not - clean air is a good end to itself , as is ending our reliance on fossil fuels and reducing our consumption of both energy and resources .
But trying to use climate change as a means to scare people into it is a bad idea .
Ultimately , we can't even predict the weather with a degree of accuracy in the medium term , so long - term climate forecasts are little more than guesswork .
To make it worse , the mechanisms are poorly understood ( e.g. some scientists claim that CO2 is a big problem , whereas others suggest that CO2 lags behind climate changes , and others suggest that water vapour has a larger greenhouse effect , etc ) .
Either way , it 's not worth worrying about , as there 's very little that the insignificant human race can do about it when mother nature decides to flex her muscles .

Operators of the sprawling state system that supplies water to 25 million Californians from Butte County to San Diego issued their lowest - ever estimate on the amount of water they will be able to deliver .
Officials predicted Tuesday they will be able to offer only 5 percent of the total volume of water requested by California cities and farms next year .
That 's the smallest water allocation the agency has released since its creation in 1967 .
The estimate , based on current water conditions , is only preliminary and is almost certain to rise as the rainy season wears on .
Still , officials expect a multiyear drought , low reservoirs and environmental restrictions on water pumping to keep supplies well below average in 2010 .
" We have to assume we 're heading into a fourth year of drought and we have to respond accordingly , " said Lester Snow , director of the California Department of Water Resources , the state agency that operates the network of reservoirs , pumps and pipelines known as the State Water Project .
Increase possible
If this winter were to bring relatively wet conditions , Snow said , deliveries ultimately could creep up to between 20 and 40 percent by spring .
Over the last 10 years , springtime water allocations have averaged about 68 percent .
Last year at this time , the department said it was likely to deliver about 15 percent .
Deliveries edged up to 40 percent after late - season precipitation boosted reservoir levels and Sierra Nevada snowpack , but about 60 water agencies across the state were forced to impose some form of mandatory rationing .
For Bay Area water districts that depend on the California water project - including many communities in Napa , Solano , Alameda and Santa Clara counties - 2010 will be another year in which conservation , recycling and groundwater storage loom large .
The Santa Clara Valley Water District , which delivers about 400,000 acre feet each year to 1.8 million residents of Silicon Valley , relies on the state water project for as much as 25 percent of its supply each year ( 1 acre foot is equal to about 326,000 gallons ) .
A slim supply next year means the district will have to lean more heavily on its local reservoirs , its recycled water system and supplies from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission 's Hetch Hetchy reservoir .
In addition , at its meeting Tuesday , the district is expected to extend a 15 percent water conservation target into next year .
" If we go in a fifth , or sixth or seventh year of drought , it 's going to get a lot more painful , " said Keith Whitman , water supply manager for the district .
Other major water agencies in the Bay Area , including San Francisco 's PUC , the East Bay Municipal Utility District and the Marin Municipal Water District , operate independent water systems that are n't tied into the state 's network .
As water managers attempt to squeeze every last drop out of their supplies , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and others used Tuesday 's announcement to underscore the importance of the state 's plan to overhaul the aging water network .
" I am encouraged that we are in a position to rebuild the system to better withstand the drought situations so we are not forced to agonize over a clean , reliable water supply for future generations , " Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
The plan for restoring the ailing Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta , improving groundwater monitoring and building new dams , reservoirs and a controversial canal calls for borrowing $ 11 billion - a measure expected to go to voters in November .
Only a broad goal
Snow acknowledged that nothing in the water plan or bond , however , directly addresses the current crisis aside from the broader goal of reducing urban water use by 20 percent by 2020 .
" We need to do a better job on conservation - it 's the single most effective tool we can use now and into next spring that will have some benefit in these drought conditions , " he said .
1 It varies .
Geospace , which surrounds Earth , is thick with atmospheric atoms and electrically charged particles .
Intergalactic space contains at best one lonely hydrogen atom per cubic meter .
2 Apollo astronauts were exposed to it .
The spacecraft 's urine - management system was not much more than a tube connecting penises to the vacuum outside .
Some astronauts report that they mistook their own crystallized urine for stars .
3 It would n't kill you right away .
In sci -fi movies , exposure to the vacuum causes humans to instantly freeze solid or burst .
In actuality , you 'd die from asphyxiation ; and in minutes , not seconds .
But there are earthlings that can withstand it for much longer : European Space Agency tests show that extremely tough little arthropod - like creatures called tardigrades can somehow survive in the vacuum for up to 10 days .
Someone at the BBC needs to make this happen immediately : British writer , comedian and actor Stephen Fry still wants to write an episode of Doctor Who .
If ever there was a perfect fit for the show , it 's this man .

Talking at the British National Television Awards , Fry - who had to drop out of writing an episode of the show during Russell T. Davies ' era as producer because of deadlines - said that he'd love a chance to try again :
The window passed , and I never really got round to it , [ b ] ut I 'm very happy to have had the experience of thinking about it ...
I look forward so much to seeing Matt Smith and I 'm sure he 's going to be wonderful .
If I get time it 'll be a thrill , I can't think of anything nicer .

Never mind Michael Moorcock or Neil Gaiman :
Fry 's mix of intelligence , comedy and humanity makes him the ideal celebrity writer as far as we 're concerned .
Who do we have to beg to make this happen ?

Talented amphibians urinate foreign objects implanted in their body cavities .
The Australian Green Tree Frog ( Litoria caerulea ) : a master of internal manipulation .
S. Huwiler / Photolibrary
Plant thorns , spiny insects and even radio transmitters do n't stick around for long inside tree frogs .
Researchers have discovered that these amphibians can absorb foreign objects from their body cavities into their bladders and excrete them through urination .
The finding will be of interest to field researchers , who often implant tiny radio transmitters into frogs to track them .
It also helps to explain how these little creatures survive a life leaping around in thorny forests and consuming spiny insects whole .
" It strikes me as being a pretty incredible mechanism for getting stuff out from the body cavity , " says lead researcher Christopher Tracy of Charles Darwin University in Darwin , Australia .
By contrast , humans and other mammals typically develop peritonitis , a potentially deadly infection of the body - cavity membrane , if the membrane is punctured or damaged by sharp objects .
As if by magic
In 2003 , Tracy and his colleagues began a project to find out how frogs regulate their body temperature .
They surgically implanted temperature - sensitive radio transmitters in the abdominal cavities of tree frogs of three species ( Litoria caerulea , Litoria dahlii and Cyclorana australis ) living around the city of Darwin .
After several months , the authors set out to recapture their frogs to log the data and replace the transmitters ' batteries .
But out in the field they found three of the transmitters lying on the ground .
" In telemetry studies of small animals , it 's not uncommon to find they 've been eaten by something , " Tracy says .
" But there 's usually some evidence that happened : scratches on the ground or a pile of predator faeces . "
In this case , the transmitters were pristine .
And the strangest discovery was yet to come : back in the lab , the researchers opened up dozens of animals and in many cases pulled transmitters not from the body cavity , but from the urinary bladder .
" That 's when we started thinking about trying to pin down exactly what was going on , " Tracy says .
Better out than in
In 2008 , Tracy and his colleagues decided to look into the phenomenon .
They kept tree frogs and cane toads in the lab and surgically implanted beads in their body cavities .
Within 2 – 3 weeks , the beads appeared on the floor of the frog cage .
Only one cane toad out of five excreted a bead , but Tracy opened some other toads after the surgery and caught them in the act of enveloping the beads into their bladders .
In just two days , the bead was surrounded by a transparent tissue devoid of blood vessels , which subsequently became vascularized and muscular .
The researchers describe their findings in a poster presentation today at a meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in Seattle , Washington .
ADVERTISEMENT
Although the study is the first to show an animal using its bladder to expel foreign objects , researchers have observed similar phenomena in other vertebrates .
Several species of fish and snake absorb objects into their intestines from the body cavity and expel them by defecation , for instance .
Rick Shine , a herpetologist at the University of Sydney , Australia , who has seen snakes expel implanted radio transmitters1 , says that the research has broad implications for understanding vertebrate physiology .
For reptiles and amphibians , at least , moving objects from one part of their innards to another may pose no problem .
" It makes sense for an animal to get an object out of the body cavity , " he says .
" The remarkable thing is that they are able to do it . "
UNITED NATIONS 
The General Assembly is preparing to approve a resolution that would endorse a United Nations report calling on both Israel and the Palestinians to investigate possible war crimes in the Gaza Strip within three months .
The assembly began discussing the nonbinding resolution , introduced by about 20 Arab League members , including Iraq , on Wednesday , but with about 50 nations scheduled to speak , a vote was not likely until Thursday .
Given the widespread support for the Palestinian cause and broad criticism of Israel , passage of the measure seemed assured .
Some members of the European Union were threatening to abstain , however , holding out for changes .
One issue was wording that would require Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to work with the Security Council on additional action ; another was the resolution ’s full endorsement of a decision last month by the United Nations Human Rights Council to adopt the report completely , diplomats said .
The 575 - page report , which was released in September , found evidence of war crimes committed by both the Israeli Army and Hamas fighters during the Gaza war last winter .
The report was researched and written by a fact - finding mission created by the Human Rights Council and led by Richard Goldstone , a South African judge and a former war crimes prosecutor for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia .
The other day , I found an artifact in my dresser drawer under a pair of mercifully underutilized jodhpurs and the glow - in - the - dark " survival briefs " my grandmother gave me for Y2 K .
The object was mashed , flattened , and bristling with cotton dingleberries , but it was , unmistakably , a Strong Bad knit cap .
There he was , vividly stitched , a balloony ' toon in a candy - apple - red Mexican wrestler mask : the de facto star of Homestar Runner .
Remember Homestar , that Flash - animated Web series from those halcyon pre-YouTube days when Web series were the Future , videos stayed put on their sites of origin , and we all had to walk a mile in the snow to find a data jack ?
I had n't visited since 2005 — a billion lifetimes ago in meme years — and , frankly , I assumed Homestar had run its last lap .
Imagine my surprise , then , to find the site alive and well and celebrating its 10th (! ) anniversary .
Ten years !
Heck , Cheers only lasted 11 .
' Twas then I realized , with equal parts horror and delight : The Web and I are both old enough to have our own Cheers .
Homestar Runner was — and still is — where everybody knows my screen name ( ScottluvsAOL69 ... clearly , not everything ages well ) .
Now , getting nostalgic for a fin de Netscape time - waster is a new and disturbing sensation for me :
Web content is designed to dissolve in your brain like dopamine Certs .
Yet my Homestar bar stool still feels warm :
Firing up the old URL , knit cap in hand , I 'm suddenly back in the early Aughts , watching Strong Bad answer his email , kick the Cheat , his rhomboid accomplice , and dream up such memorable mini-memes as the majestic dragon Trogdor the Burninator — a Trapper Keeper - quality pencil doodle with a catchy metal theme song .
( It ended up name - checked in the Buffy finale and eventually landed in Guitar Hero II . )
Sure , Homestar is well past its prime ; its creators , the Atlanta - based brother act Matt and Mike Chapman , say the peak came around 2005 , just as YouTube and embeddable , user - uploaded video began re-terraforming the media landscape .
But viewership is still steady , and the ad - free site remains profitable , supported by T - shirts and assorted Home schwag .
( Merch is probably the best indicator of a property 's real - world health . )
Strong Bad & Co. have always existed in their own little universe , unbeholden to #trendingtopics .
And that might explain why they 're still around .
By design ( or lack thereof ) , Homestar has remained a fixed point in a roiling video maelstrom .
It succeeds outside of time , chrono-stationary , like Deloreans , or Walt Disney 's frozen head .
The Homestar mythos , to the extent that it is referential at all , is cobbled together from safely dated curios like late - '80s hair metal and 8 - bit videogames .
Like Cheers , Monty Python , Seinfeld , and other cherished old - media amaranths that live on in fan affection , Homestar grows its own culture instead of simply riding the jet stream .
Ninja crazes come and go , and everybody tries to ape South Park and Adult Swim — but Homestar , despite superficial similarities , never really chased that dragon .
It drew its own .
It even has its own holidays ( Decemberween ) and ersatz hip - hop slang ( " all - up-ons " ) .
I think Homestar presages a new webstalgia : I may never find myself getting misty over the Dancing Banana , but Get Your War On ?
All your Web touchstones are belong to us .
I fully expect to get a little teary someday when we start playing Hot Or Not over warm Jell - O at the Robot - Assisted Living Facility for Retired Singulatarians .
With any luck , I 'll be taking my grandchildren on visits to HomeStarRunner.com .
" Kids , " I 'll say , " this is what I was spending my time watching back in the day . "
" You mean , while you were n't fixing the climate catastrophe ? " they 'll ask .
" Hush , " I 'll say , " and put your respirators back on .
Strong Bad 's got a hilarious old - skool rap coming up , and you 're gonna need extra oxygen for the belly laugh . "

Now that the Senate has caught up with the House by passing a sweeping health care bill , lawmakers are on the verge of extending coverage to the tens of millions of Americans who have no health insurance .
But what about the roughly 160 million workers and their dependents who already have health insurance through an employer ?
For many people , the result of the long , angry health care debate in Washington may be little more than more of the same .
As President Obama once promised , “ If you like your health plan , you can keep your health plan . ”
That may be true even if you do n’t like your health plan .
And no one seems to agree on whether the legislation will do much to reduce workers ’ continually rising out - of - pocket costs .
True , there is an important advantage for the working insured : more peace of mind for people who are worried about being laid off or would like to change jobs .

An employee prepares ground beef for shipping at the Fresno , Calif . plant of Beef Packers Inc. on Nov. 24 .
HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER
For the second time this year , a Fresno beef company is recalling thousands of pounds of ground beef contaminated with a drug - resistant strain of salmonella .
Beef Packers Inc. , owned by Cargill , announced the recall Friday .
It covers 22,723 pounds of ground beef products that were sent to stores in Arizona and New Mexico .
WHY : Recall did n't include school lunches SECOND INFECTION : Family 's nightmare begins The Arizona Department of Health Services has linked two illnesses to the ground beef , made at the Beef Packers plant on Sept. 23 .
The beef was " repackaged into consumer - size packages and sold under different retail brand names , " according to a news release issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Food Safety and Inspection Service .
Safeway announced that the recall affects ground beef sold at its stores in Arizona and one outlet in Gallup , N.M. A Safeway spokesman said the recalled product is no longer in stores and urged customers to check all ground beef in their freezers and discard any with " sell by " dates of Sept. 28 through Oct. 11 .
Recalled products include fresh ground beef , beef patties , meat balls and stuffed peppers .
In August , Beef Packers recalled almost 826,000 pounds of ground beef contaminated with salmonella Newport , the same strain that prompted the current recall .
At least 39 people were sickened in the weeks before the summer recall , which included orders produced at the plant in June .
Salmonella Newport infections can be life - threatening , especially to young children , the elderly and people with weak immune systems .
Symptoms include diarrhea , fever , cramps and vomiting .
Because this strain is resistant to antibiotics , the risk of hospitalization is increased .
A USA TODAY investigation published last week raised questions about whether orders the company made for the National School Lunch Program also should have been included in the summer recall .
Although the orders made for schools tested negative for salmonella , food - safety experts and lawmakers say the beef produced for schools should have been rejected by the government .
Instead , it was sent to schools .
Beef Packers has been a major supplier to the school lunch program .
Since July , however , it has bid on no contracts and produced no ground beef for schools , Cargill spokesman Mark Klein says .
It has been suspended from the school lunch program three times , twice for repeatedly failing to produce ground beef that was free of salmonella , USA TODAY found .

Advertisement President Barack Obama has said Wall Street must repay $ 117bn ( £ 72bn ) to taxpayers and criticised banks for " massive profits and obscene bonuses " .
The tax is to recoup money US taxpayers are expected to lose from bailing out the banks during the financial crisis .
" My commitment is to recover every single dime the American people are owed , " the president said .
The move follows populist anger at banks , seen as being responsible for causing the recent economic crisis .
Average American
" My determination to achieve this goal is only heightened when I see reports of massive profits and obscene bonuses at the very firms who owe their continued existence to the American people , " the president said .
He said the aim was not to punish Wall Street firms but to stop abuses and excesses from happening again .
It 's one more thing dragging on the sector , but it 's spread over 10 years , so it 's not so consequential .
It 's petty theft from bank balance sheets
Robert Albertson , chief strategist at Sandler O'Neill
The BBC's Michelle Fleury said the president had made clear " in strong language " that the banks must repay the taxpayer , through what is being dubbed a " financial crisis responsibility fee " .
" It may go some way to quelling the anger of the average American , " our correspondent said .
The tax would apply only to financial firms with assets of more than $ 50 bn .
There are reckoned to be about 50 of these institutions - although many did not accept any taxpayer assistance and many others have already paid back what the government lent to them .
BBC Business editor Robert Peston said that the cost may be passed on to the banks ' customers .
" The cost of borrowing might go up for companies who borrow from these banks , " he said .
He said there might also potentially be a " one-off " squeeze on the US economy .
' Drag on sector '
In the US , analysts said the fact that the fees levied on banks would be spread out over a decade would diminish their impact .
" It throws some sand into the gears , " said Robert Albertson , chief strategist at Sandler O'Neill in New York .
" It 's one more thing dragging on the sector , but it 's spread over 10 years , so it 's not so consequential .
It 's petty theft from bank balance sheets . "
White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers said the proposed fee was structured to give financial firms incentives to avoid excessive leverage .
The levy comes ahead of the latest reporting season on Wall Street , with banks expected to report record bonuses .
The tax will claw back some of the losses from a $ 700 bn taxpayer bail - out of American banks known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) .
It was drawn up in the midst of the financial crisis in 2008 , following the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers and multi-billion dollar rescue of insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) .
It helped stem the crisis by injecting public capital into the biggest US banks and restoring confidence in the banking system .

It ’s already starting .
People are talking about potential Republican candidates for 2012 and Ron Paul is being ignored and smeared .
Look at this article from Andrew Malcom of the LATimes blog .
“ With only 1,448 days left before the 2012 election , you - know - who is making plans to launch another long - shot campaign for the presidency . ”
“ .. Of course , Paul ’s total $ 35 million is only about two weeks ’ or less take for the ’08 Barack Obama money - printing machine .
But since when have the odds ever deterred Paul ? ”
The facts are Obama had hundreds of millions in free publicity given to him from the main stream media and much of it was neutral or positive .
Ron Paul raised his money in spite of tens of millions in negative publicity freely given from the main stream media to him , and it looks like “ free publicity ” is still to come .
Look at this article .
Do you see Ron Paul ?
In fact , Ron Paul supporters are described as “ fringe elements ” throughout the comments section .
And take a look at this Gallup Poll , Ron Paul is nowhere to be found .
Ron Paul is also ignored in reports on the poll here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here .
If we thought things had changed and were going to be different this time around we thought wrong .
The only question to ask now is if we intend to do anything about it .
I ’ve started a pledge site that offers four ways for people to indicate their support for Ron Paul in 2012 at www.DraftRonPaul.com
Becoming a facebook friend is probably the most important way to indicate your support but the pledge is very important as well ( especially in case any “ technical ” glitch comes along and destroys the facebook fanpage ) .
I hope you ’ll take all four actions on the website and tell your friends to do the same .
The numbers matter .
We were laughed at until we could prove support for Ron Paul with his fund raising .
It wo n’t be any different this time .
Neo-con Republican ’s rave about Sarah Palin ’s nine hundred thousand plus facebook fans .
We need to do the same and more .
Please visit www.DraftRonPaul.com today and indicate your support for him to run and win in 2012 .
It ’s free to show your support and only takes a minute of your time .
We must start now , our opposition has .
Sincerely ,
Trevor Lyman
' T ' budding is the preferred method for grafting tangerine trees and is primarily done to join desirable fruit - bearing qualities of one type of tangerine to the disease resistant and hardy understock of another citrus tree .
This is performed by taking a live bud from one tree and implanting it into the root stock or ' understock ' of the other .
The growth that comes from the cutting will bear fruit that is genetically identical to the tree it was taken from .
' T ' budding is a fairly simple process with a high success rate .
Gather a bud stick from the previous season 's growth and up to 1/2 inch in diameter from the desired tangerine tree .
Ensure the stick has several bud nodes on it .
Remove the bud stick from the tree and clip off any leaves .
Wrap the branch in a damp cloth or sphagnum moss to keep it moist .
Place the bud stick in a plastic bag and store it in the refrigerator until needed .
' T ' budding is the preferred method for grafting tangerine trees and is primarily done to join desirable fruit - bearing qualities of one type of tangerine to the disease resistant and hardy understock of another citrus tree .
Remove a bud to be grafted from the branch by cutting under the bud .
Begin the cut around 1 / 2 inch below the base of the bud and slice upward , ending 1/ 2 inch above it .
Trim the top edge of the bud 's bark square to form a little shield shape .
Squeeze the cutting , gently , to remove the inner wood under the bark of the bud .
Do not let the newly removed bud dry out .
Make a ' T ' shaped incision through the bark of the trunk on a young tree selected as the understock .
Do not cut too deeply .
Lift the corners of the cut with the tip of the knife to loosen the bark from the trunk .
Remove a bud to be grafted from the branch by cutting under the bud .
Lift the corners of the cut with the tip of the knife to loosen the bark from the trunk .
Insert the pointed part of the bud 's bark into the ' T ' so that slides under the bark of the understock tree .
Slide the bud in until the top of the shield meets the cross cut in the ' T ' .
Wrap the trunk with rubber band strips to hold the bud in place .
Do not cover the bud .
Check the bud after two weeks to see if the graft has taken .
The bud should remain dormant until next spring .
As the bud starts to grow , cut off the stock above it .
Remove any shoots sent out by the root stock to encourage the new bud to grow .
The spectacular new camera installed on NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope during Servicing Mission 4 in May has delivered the most detailed view of star birth in the graceful , curving arms of the nearby spiral galaxy M83 .
Nicknamed the Southern Pinwheel , M83 is undergoing more rapid star formation than our own Milky Way galaxy , especially in its nucleus .
The sharp " eye " of the Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) has captured hundreds of young star clusters , ancient swarms of globular star clusters , and hundreds of thousands of individual stars , mostly blue supergiants and red supergiants .
The image at right is Hubble 's close - up view of the myriad stars near the galaxy 's core , the bright whitish region at far right .
An image of the entire galaxy , taken by the European Southern Observatory 's Wide Field Imager on the ESO / MPG 2.2 - meter telescope at La Silla , Chile , is shown at left .
The white box outlines Hubble 's view .
WFC3's broad wavelength range , from ultraviolet to near - infrared , reveals stars at different stages of evolution , allowing astronomers to dissect the galaxy 's star - formation history .
The image reveals in unprecedented detail the current rapid rate of star birth in this famous " grand design " spiral galaxy .
The newest generations of stars are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark dust lanes , the backbone of the spiral arms .
These fledgling stars , only a few million years old , are bursting out of their dusty cocoons and producing bubbles of reddish glowing hydrogen gas .
The excavated regions give a colorful " Swiss cheese " appearance to the spiral arm .
Gradually , the young stars ' fierce winds ( streams of charged particles ) blow away the gas , revealing bright blue star clusters .
These stars are about 1 million to 10 million years old .
The older populations of stars are not as blue .
A bar of stars , gas , and dust slicing across the core of the galaxy may be instigating most of the star birth in the galaxy 's core .
The bar funnels material to the galaxy 's center , where the most active star formation is taking place .
The brightest star clusters reside along an arc near the core .
The remains of about 60 supernova blasts , the deaths of massive stars , can be seen in the image , five times more than known previously in this region .
WFC3 identified the remnants of exploded stars .
By studying these remnants , astronomers can better understand the nature of the progenitor stars , which are responsible for the creation and dispersal of most of the galaxy 's heavy elements .
M83 , located in the Southern Hemisphere , is often compared to M51 , dubbed the Whirlpool galaxy , in the Northern Hemisphere .
Located 15 million light - years away in the constellation Hydra , M83 is two times closer to Earth than M51 .
The United States is about to lose a key arms - control tool from the closing days of the Cold War — the right to station American observers in Russia to count the long - range missiles leaving its assembly line .
The end of full - time , on - site access will likely ignite complaints in Congress , with insiders from both parties arguing over whether the George W. Bush or the Obama administration is responsible .
Republicans are worried by the previously undisclosed agreement between the Obama administration and the Kremlin in October , which formalizes the inspectors ’ departure this Saturday .
This , they warn , would cripple Washington ’s ability to police Moscow ’s compliance with agreed reductions in its nuclear arsenal .
Democrats , on the other hand , insist they were “ stuck ” with an agreement reached late last year between the Bush administration and Moscow but not made public .
This , they said , left the Obama team no choice .

The U.S. - staffed Votkinsk Portal Monitoring Facility operates under the terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START I ) at the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant , about 600 miles east of Moscow — the site where all Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) are built .
The monitoring facility ’s present mandate ends with START ’s expiration Saturday , and the Obama administration has decided not to seek another agreement allowing Americans to remain , administration and congressional officials said .
“ U.S. and Russian officials signed on Oct. 20 a series of documents , which establish the procedures to be followed for the completion of U.S. monitoring activities at the Russian ICBM production facility at Votkinsk , ” a State Department official said .
The two countries first agreed to “ continuous monitoring ” under the 1987 Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
The reciprocal site to Votkinsk in the United States was the former Hercules Aerospace missile production facility in Magna , Utah , which the Russians left more than eight years ago .
Although the United States does not produce new long - range missiles , Russia continues to do so and has built dozens of missiles since the monitoring started 15 years ago .
START banned certain types of missiles , which Americans at Votkinsk verified by counting and inspecting every missile that left the facility , analysts said .
However , the head of Russia ’s strategic missile forces , Nikolai Solovtsov , was recently quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that the assembly and deployment of next - generation RS - 24 missiles would start once the treaty expires .
Analysts said that could happen , because Moscow was not banned from developing new missiles .
During a visit to Moscow by President Obama in July , both countries agreed to draft a new arms - control treaty that would replace START .
They also set a goal of cutting the number of strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,500 and 1,675 within seven years .
It now appears unlikely that the two countries will meet a self - imposed Dec. 5 deadline , but State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Monday the U.S. hopes to have a draft treaty by the end of the month .
“ Two main priorities here are reductions in nuclear arsenals and also preserving the verifications and monitoring mechanisms that are at the heart of the START treaty , ” Mr. Kelly said .
Congressional officials said they were told by the Obama administration that it “ got stuck ” with a deal made by the Bush administration to close the monitoring facility at Votkinsk .
They also said the Bush administration did not want to extend START at all .
Paula A. DeSutter , assistant secretary of state for verification , compliance and implementation in the Bush administration , said she sent the Russians a post - START proposal in November 2008 , but it was not a negotiated agreement .
She confirmed that it did not include continuing the Votkinsk mission , but attributed that to the Bush team ’s decision “ not to limit delivery vehicles , ” so it did not need to count every missile Russia produced .
“ We did n’t need the entire verification regime from START , ” she said .
In contrast , the Obama team “ accepted the START approach to limit both warheads and missiles , ” so it made sense for them to keep Votkinsk , she said .
“ There was nothing in our proposal that precluded the Obama administration from adding Votkinsk or any other verification measure , had they decided to take that approach , ” Ms. DeSutter said .
However , Daryl Kimball , executive director of the Arms Control Association , said the Obama team could not have gone back to renegotiate last year ’s accord .
Obama administration officials said they take Moscow ’s missile program seriously , and they are negotiating other verification measures to replace the permanent U.S. presence at Votkinsk .
They declined to be more specific .
Mr. Kimball said that other ways to find out how many missiles Russia produces include regular inspections , data exchanges and intelligence gathering , such as tracking missile test flights .
“ How significant [ the loss of Votkinsk ] is depends on what other monitoring mechanisms will be worked out , ” he said .
Some Republican members of Congress , however , have warned of major negative consequences , saying that nothing can replace everyday on - site monitoring , and that the administration should have sought to extend it under a new agreement .
U.S. officials are trying to complete a “ bridging ” agreement in Geneva this week , so some verification measures can remain in effect until a START replacement is finalized .
The Votkinsk monitoring team , however , will leave , officials said .
“ When Votkinsk goes away , Russia could deploy hundreds of missiles , ” said one senior Republican Senate aide .
“ Russia is a big country with many satellites passing overhead , ” so it will not be easy to count missiles based on test flights .
“ We are worried about what Russia will do that we are not going to know . ”
Another Republican aide said the “ whole point of arms control ” was to allow the United States to learn more about Russia ’s force strength than it could by just estimating it .
“ We were radically bad about estimating , but we became better at understanding our adversary ” after START and other treaties , he said .
“ You ca n’t count mobile missiles from space . ”
The Obama administration points out that the two countries are no longer enemies and that it has gone out of its way to improve relations with Russia .
“ The nature of our relationship has changed , and we have a pretty good idea about where Russia ’s missile program is headed , ” one U.S. official said .
Still , critics say ties are not at a level where Washington can fully trust Moscow .
“ For the first time in 15 years , an extensive set of verification , notification , elimination and other confidence - building measures will expire ” on Saturday , Sen.
Jon Kyl , Arizona Republican , said on the Senate floor late last month , suggesting that START should have been extended .
Mr. Kimball said another reason the Bush administration should take at least some responsibility for losing access to Votkinsk is that it “ did not object to Russia ’s development of the RS - 24 and did not favor the continuation of other types of legally binding verification provisions based on those in START . ”
“ Senator Kyl was not on the floor of Senate railing against the Bush administration ’s decision not to continue essential START monitoring and verification provisions back in 2008 , but now he ’s complaining that the Obama administration is not doing enough to maintain effective monitoring of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons , ” Mr. Kimball said .
“ He was against it before he was for it . ”
A senior aide to Mr. Kyl said the senator always cared about verification , but he is more vocal now because Mr. Obama wants to cut the two countries ’ nuclear arsenals well below Mr. Bush ’s target level of 1,700 to 2,200 warheads .
“ If you are going to predicate the prudence of the cuts on the Russians ’ [ compliance ] , you have to make sure you have high degree of confidence ” that they are abiding by the limits , he said .

January 27 , 2010 -- On January 12 , 2010 , a 7.3 Richter scale earthquake struck Port - au - Prince , the capital of Haiti .
The earthquake caused great destruction and 200,000 people are thought to be dead .
Further , 3 million Haitians have been rendered homeless by the quake , which also damaged many public service buildings , such as hospitals and schools .
The quake has caused Haitians , who have struggled under decades of poverty and imperialist intervention and exploitation , even deeper suffering .
Approximately 75 % of Haitians earned less than US $ 2 per day and 56 % of Haitians – around 4.5 million people – earned less than $ 1 per day .
Most Haitians live in houses made of adobe and mud .
Haiti is the poorest nation in the western hemisphere .
The poverty is caused by the imperialism and neo-liberalism that has been oppressing the nation for centuries .
The Haitian people has continuously struggled against this oppression .
The 400,000 African slaves on the colonialists ’ sugar and coffee plantations were among the first to fight against slavery and , in the early 19th century , won their struggle : Haiti became the first independent Afro-populated nation previously colonised by France .
However , the newly independent nation was forced to pay 150 millions Francs in “ damages ” to its former colonial master , France .
For decades , the Haitian people suffered under and struggled against US - puppet dictatorships and regimes .
In 2004 , after eventually winning democratic presidential elections , Jean - Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in a US - backed coup and then ostracised by the US administration .
Neoliberal policies were enforced on the population : education and health services were privatised and import tariffs on rice were severely cut to pay Haiti ’s foreign debt .
Under the pretext of helping Haiti to recover from the earthquake , the US is now trying to retake power in Haiti and redesign the political and economic situation to suit international capital .
This is not the first time the US has done this : New Orleans , smashed by Hurricane Katrina , and Sri Lanka , Indonesia and Thailand , devastated by the great tsunami in 2004 , have faced a similar situation to Haiti .
Natural disasters are used to legitimise “ aid ” that has neoliberal requirements attached , such as privatisation and the selling of public assets .
The US has sent 3000 fully armed troops to Haiti .
Soon , it will increase that number to around 15,000 troops .
This intervention is based on the declaration of an emergency situation , which was forced on Haiti by the US when US secretary of state Hillary Clinton visited Haiti on January 16 .
Very quickly afterwards , the US took control of the airport : it is now deciding what goes in and out of Haiti .
US troops are not mobilised for the sake of humanity .
Instead the US military ’s mission is to preserve the reactionary social order for US corporations and to protect the wealthy few .
This is evident by the failure to use US warships to take care the injured people .
The increase in US troops in Haiti is closely related to US economic and political interest in Latin America as a whole , where it is attempting to strengthen its power and is developing military bases .
We note the bilateral agreement between the US and Colombia , which gives the US wide access to Colombia ’s military bases and increases US forces stationed in Colombia , as the latest example of this .
The next stage of the US post - disaster program in Haiti is redesigning the country ’s economy .
This is indicated by the International Monetary Fund ’s announcement of a US $ 100 million loan to Haiti that requires the implementation of more neoliberal programs , including increasing electricity tariffs , freezing state workers ’ wages and reducing inflation .
That loan will greatly increase the burden on Haiti , which already has a debt of US $ 165 million .
Based on this , we , the undersigned , extend our solidarity to the people of Haiti , including humanitarian aid and support for the Haitian people ’s struggle for freedom from imperialist exploitation .
Furthermore , we demand :
The immediate and unconditional cancellation of Haiti ’s debt ;
That government in our countries give substantial , untied and unconditional humanitarian aid to the people of Haiti ;
That the humanitarian aid will support and be used to reconstruct Haiti in a way that will empower the people of Haiti to establish democracy and genuine independence for their nation .
We condemn the United States government ’s exploitation of the disaster to advance the United State ’s economic and political interests by making disaster as a relief industry .
We are calling all democratic and progressive organisations around the world to unite to build true solidarity with the people of Haiti .
This includes helping to end the Haitian people ’s oppression by the imperialist states , and full support for the restoration of freedom and sovereignty for the people of Haiti .

Statemen Solidaritas untuk Rakyat Haiti
Pada tanggal 12 Januari 2010 , gempa berkekuatan 7,3 skala Richter mengguncang Port - au - Prince , ibukota Haiti .
Gempa tersebut mengakibatkan kehancuran yang luar biasa dan korban jatuh diperkirakan dapat mencapai 200.000 orang .
Sementara itu tiga juta orang tidak memiliki tempat tinggal karena rumah mereka hancur akibat gempa .
Gempa juga mengakibatkan kerusakan pada bangunan - bangunan publik seperti rumah sakit , sekolah .
Gempa tersebut semakin menghancurkan kehidupan rakyat Haiti yang sebelumnya telah dihantui oleh kemiskinan dan penindasan Imperialis selama berabad - abad .
Sekitar 75 % rakyat Haiti hidup dengan pendapatan kurang dari US $ 2 perhari , dan 56 % - empat setengah juta rakyat – hidup dengan kurang dari US $ 1 perhari .
Banyak dari rakyat Haiti hidup dalam rumah - rumah yang terbuat dari batako dan lumpur .
Haiti adalah Negara termiskin di belahan barat .
Kemiskinan yang diderita oleh Rakyat Haiti tidak bisa dilepaskan penindasan Imperialisme dan Neoliberalisme selama berabad - abad .
Rakyat Haiti sendiri memiliki sejarah panjang perlawanan terhadap penindasan tersebut .
Sebanyak 400.000 budak Afrika , yang dipekerjakan pada perkebunan tebu dan kopi milik para kolonial termasuk yang pertama berjuang melawan perbudakan dan pada awal abad ke -19 memenangkan perjuangan mereka .
Haiti menjadi Negara pertama kulit hitam yang mendapatkan kemerdekaan dari kolonialisme dan perbudakan Perancis .
Namun begitu mereka dipaksa membayar hutangnya sebesar 150 juta Francs sebagai ganti rugi kepada bekas Negara penjajahnya Perancis .
Setelah berpuluh - puluh tahun rakyat Haiti menderita dan berjuang melawan rejim dan diktaktor boneka AS .
Pada tahun 2004 setelah akhirnya memenangkan pemilihan presiden yang demokratis , Jean - Bertrand Aristide , digulingkan dan diasingkan dalam sebuah kudeta yang didalangi oleh AS dan kemudian diasingkan oleh Pemerintahan AS .
Kebijakan - kebijakan neoliberal dipaksakan kepada rakyat Haiti ; sektor pendidikan dan kesehatan diprivatisasi dan tariff imporbagi beras dipotong untuk membayar hutang luar negeri Haiti .
Menggunakan dalil membantu Haiti dari kerusakan akibat gempa , AS sekarang mencoba mengmbail kekuasaan di Haiti dan mendesain ulang situasi politik dan ekonomi Haiti sesuai dengan keinginan modal internasional .
Praktek ini bukan pertama kali terjadi : sebelumnya di New Orleans setelah diporak porandakan oleh Badai Katrina serta Sri Lanka , Indonesia dan Thailand setelah Tsunami 2004 , menghadapi situasi yang sama dengan Haiti .
Bencana alam digunakan untuk melegitimasi “ bantuan ” yang memiliki syarat - syarat neoliberal dengannya seperti seperti privatisasi dan penjualan asset - aset rakyat .
Amerika Serikat telah mengirimkan sekitar 3.000 personil militernya dengan bersenjata lengkap ke Haiti .
Tidak lama lagi akan ditambah menjadi sekitar 15.000 tentara .
Intervensi ini berkaitan dengan keputusan Keadaan Darurat yang dipaksakan ke Haiti oleh AS saat kunjungan Hillary Clinton pada hari Sabtu , 16 Januari 2010 .
Segera setelah itu Amerika Serikat mengambil alih bandara udara Haiti : menentukan apa yang bisa masuk dan keluar dari Haiti .
Penambahan pasukan militer di Haiti oleh Amerika Serikat tidak berkaitan dengan bantuan kemanusiaan .
Hal tersebut berkaitan dengan mempertahankan tatanan reaksioner modal - modal AS dan melindungi kekayaan segelintir orang .
Hal ini dapat terlihat dari tidak digunakannya kapal - kapal perang AS untuk merawat korban gempa ditengah kondisi banyaknya korban yang berjatuhan .
Penambahan kekuatan militer tersebut tidak bisa dilepaskan dari kepentingan ekonomi dan politik Imperialis AS secara keseluruhan di Amerika Latin .
Dimana AS mencoba memperkuat kekuasaannya dan mengembangkan basis - basis militernya .
Kasus yang terakhir adalah perjanjian militer antara AS dengan Colombia , dimana AS akan memiliki akses kepada basis - basis militer Colombia dan juga penambahan pasukan AS di Colombia .
Tahapan berikutnya dalam program paska bencana AS di Haiti adalah mendesain ulang ekonomi Haiti .
Ini juga sudah terlihat dengan diumumkannya pinjaman baru sebesar $ 100 juta ke Haiti oleh IMF .
Syarat - syarat dalam pinjaman baru tersebut adalah penerapan lebih banyak program - program neoliberal .
Seperti menaikan harga listrik , membekukan upah pegawai negeri dan menahan inflasi .
Hutang itu sendiri akan menambah beban Haiti yang telah memiliki hutang yang mencekik leher rakyat Haiti sebesar $ 165 juta .
Berdasarkan hal diatas kami , yang menandatangani pernyataan sikap ini , bersolidaritas sepenuhnya kepada rakyat Haiti .
Dan berkomitmen untuk membangun solidaritas tersebut dalam bentuk bantuan kemanusiaan maupun dukungan terhadap perjuangan pembebasan rakyat Haiti dari Imperialisme .
Kami menuntut :
a. Penghapusan hutang Haiti dengan segera dan tanpa syarat b.
Agar pemerintah yang berkuasa di negeri kami memberikan bantuan kemanusiaan yang pokok , tanpa syarat dan tanpa ikatan kepada rakyat Haiti c. Agar bantuan kemanusiaan tersebut akan mendukung dan digunakan dalam proses rekonstruksi Haiti yang akan menguatkan posisi rakyat Haiti dalam membangun demokrasi dan kemandirian bangsanya .
d. Kami mengutuk Pemerintahan Amerika Serikat yang telah mengeksploitasi bencana gempa untuk memajukan kepentingan ekonomi dan politik Amerika Serikat dengan membuat bencana sebagai industri bantuan .
Kami menyerukan kepada seluruh kelompok demokratik dan prograsif didunia untuk bersatu membangun solidaritas sejati kepada rakyat Haiti .
Ini termasuk membantu menghentikan penindasan terhadap rakyat Haiti oleh Negara - negara Imperialis , dan mendukung sepenuhnya pengembalian kemerdekaan dan kedaulatan rakyat Haiti .

Pete Doherty arrested for taking drugs into court moments after avoiding prison sentence for drink - driving
Rock singer Pete Doherty was arrested in a courthouse today moments after he was spared jail with a fine for driving offences .
Police seized the 30 - year - old Babshambles singer in the corridors at Gloucester Crown Court , where he was appearing on drink - drive and careless driving charges .
But moments after avoiding a jail term - he was ordered to pay £ 2,050 in fines and banned from driving for 18 months - officers pounced and escorted him down the court steps to the police station across the road .
Surprise : Pete Doherty is led away from court by police after just escaping a jail term for motoring offences .
He looks as if he had ripped his trousers
The police later confirmed he had been arrested on suspicion of possessing a controlled drug - which he is believed to have dropped as he checked in at security .
The bedraggled musician looked messy and appeared to have ripped his trousers .
Minutes before the dramatic scene the court heard Kate Moss 's former lover admit to careless driving on June 11 this year after playing a well - received gig to 300 fans at Guildhall .
He also admitted to drink driving that night , having given a reading of 50mg of alcohol per 100 ml of breath .
Prosecutor Sarah Regan said the careless driving charge related to an ' erratic , sharp turn ' .
After a pursuit , Doherty stopped the Mercedes and swapped seats with passenger Daisy Whitbread in an apparent attempt to avoid punishment .
The songwriter had already been disqualified from driving in 2007 and had not renewed his licence , the court heard .
History :
The singer is no stranger to the police and has 21 previous drug offences and six previous motoring offences
Officers found one wrap of heroin in the car , worth up to £ 35 , and what was described as ' home - made crack pipe ' on the driver 's seat .
A search of Doherty 's country home in Durley , near Marlborough , Wiltshire , uncovered a further 15 wraps worth around £ 350 .
Ms Regan said Doherty claimed to have offered to drive instead of his female companion who felt she was not fit to take the wheel .
She added : ' Mr Doherty was pulled from the door and arrested .
It was noted that he was extremely unsteady on his feet , his eyes were glazed and he smelt very strongly of alcohol , causing the officer to form the view he was drunk . '
Ms Regan said Doherty had been driven to the gig by his manager but 'as he came out of the back of Guildhall where the car was waiting , there were lots of people waiting - including a number of photographers . '
' Not wanting to be photographed with Ms Whitbread , Mr Doherty said that he just drove off as fast as he could .
He saw the flashing lights of the police car behind him but did n't think that they were for him .
' During the gig he said that he had been provided with half a bottle of rum when he went on stage and that it was probably empty when the gig finished .
Arrival : Pete turned up for court and tried to hide from photographers behind his coat .
He did n't have that luxury when he left court flanked by two police officers
' However , although he admitted that he had probably had enough to drink to make him over the limit , he did n't think it would impair him in any way . '
Doherty had earlier admitted to two counts of drugs possession , driving without a licence and without insurance , as part of the same episode .
The judge was waiting until today 's pleas were entered before dealing with all the offences together .
The court heard Doherty had 21 previous drug offences and six previous motoring offences .
He had no convictions for drink driving .
Doherty 's defence barrister Peter Ratliff asked for a financial penalty , which Judge Martin Picton said was ' proportionate to the offence ' .
A Gloucestershire Constabulary spokeswoman said : ' A 30 - year - old Wiltshire man has been arrested on suspicion of being in possession of a controlled substance .
He is currently assisting police with their inquiries . '
This is the all - new 2012 Ford Focus .
From our perspective it's one of the greatest automotive comeback stories in a long time .
After too many indifferent refreshes it 's finally , and awesomely , everything enthusiasts have been begging Ford to build .
Advertisement
When the Focus first debuted , it was a breath of fresh air , resetting opinions of what small , American cars could be .
It was light on its feet with a brilliant chassis , a zippy and frugal Zetec engine , a crisp manual transmission and enough personality and quality inside and out the cars sold by the boatload .
Then things started to go downhill .
Materials quality was reduced , cost cutting removed sound deadening and the car began to feel chintzy .
The 2005 refresh turned an interesting car into an ugly one and then in 2008 Ford really stabbed enthusiasts in the heart .
While the European Focus was winning nearly every award on the continent , they shoveled a hideous , cheap feeling , coarse , terrible driving vehicle wearing the Focus name .
The car boasted fantastic new technology unprecedented in the segment , but it was a disappointment to say the least .
This 2012 Focus is not a disappointment .
It 's absolutely everything enthusiasts have been asking for .
It 's a global car with at least 80 % content shared across the globe .
It 's once again daring in its styling , sleek and rather sexy , polarizing and above all interesting .
They 've managed to create a sedan as attractive if not more so than the hatchback , oh , and they 're bringing back the proper hatchback .
There are clever details throughout ;
The hatchback 's fuel door is camouflaged behind a diamond - shaped panel under the passenger tail light .
The Z - shaped " Zorro Clip " as the designers call it , is a not - so - subtle character line on the front door .
It also points to how confident Ford is about their tolerances and hinges , if any part does n't measure up , it 'll show .

Inside it 's much the same story .
The new Focus has a packed with high technology and handsome shapes , grippy seats , excellent door coverings and with plenty of room all around .
It 's got the Sync system of course but also the new MyFord system and Sony audio , passive keyless entry , rain sensing wipers , a park assist system , and rear camera .
The car rides on an all - new chassis made of high - strength steel and designed with Ford 's Trinity crash structure .
They 're targeting award - winning ride and handling and doing it with electric power steering , dynamic cornering control and a torque vectoring differential .
You 'll be able to get a huge set of 235/40R19 tires , that 's plenty of grip .
Under the hood there 's a direct injection 2.0 - liter four - cylinder with twin independent variable cam timing producing " better than 150 HP . "
It 's paired with a manual six speed or the Powershift dual clutch automatic .
Of course we 're frothing at the mouth fat the prospect of these cars getting an Ecoboost four cylinder making an easy Focus RS or SVT .
Ford , thank for finally , finally reuniting the Euro Focus with the US model , and doing it with some swagger .
We look forward to tossing it into a corner and hopefully coming out on the other side grinning ear to ear .
Today is the day of the worldwide homeopathic overdose that originally started with groups of skeptics throughout the UK — the 1023 Campaign — planning a protest ( or a demonstration , in the literal sense of the word ) in front of a high street pharmacy chain against their insistence on selling homeopathic products , despite repeated scientific analysis and practical demonstrations proving they are no better than the placebo effect .
I had arranged to attend the Oxford Skeptics in the Pub event due to take place near Radcliffe Camera , but — despite getting everything prepared last night , including programming my satnav for a carpark near the event — I forgot to set my alarm .
I admit it : I am an idiot .
So I dropped an email apology to the organiser and prepared to ‘ overdose ’ at home … without the homeopathic protection of homeopathic medical services against this homeopathic act of homeopathic self harm .
Homeopathically dangerous , I ’m sure you ’ll agree .
At precisely 10:23 this morning , I broke the seal and emptied the contents of my pre-purchased container of “ 30 c Homeopathic potency of Sepia officinalis ” — as it says in bold red lettering on the label — into my camera ’s lens cap and then swallowed it all ( minus the lens cap ) in one sugary , children ’s sweets - like gulp , washed down with a few mouthfuls of water .
It ’s now some time later and I ’m feeling homeopathically ill , the world is homeopathically spinning around me , and I think I may homeopathically pass out anytime soon .
Or put another way : I ’m typing this blog post while drinking a nice cup of tea , and considering making myself a late breakfast .
I am , by all accounts , homeopathically dead .
And while I could n’t quite work out how to take photos while in the process of swallowing the sugar pills , I did take some .
Behold !
The mighty power of the sugar pill !
Pics 1 & 2 : Note the therapeutic indications line in the second image .
Pic 3 : Every pillule emptied into my camera ’s lens cap .
Pic 4 : Oh look , it ’s 10:23 !
We know what that time means …
Pic 5 : All gone !
Sweet sugary goodness … and utter pseudoscientific bollocks .
You only have my word to go on that I committed homeopathic harakiri today ( although my cat witnessed it , I ’m not sure she ’d be suitable to give testimony ) , but in this article alone I have provided orders of magnitude more evidence of me swallowing these pills than exists for the efficacy of homeopathy .
I did indeed swallow them all in one gulp , and it ’s over 90 minutes since I did so and the world ( or my world , at least ) has not ended .
And I paid £ 4.99 for the privilege .
If you think that homeopathy has helped someone you know , then neither of you understand the importance of the placebo effect .
Please learn about it — it ’s a very real effect with measurable positive results .
Ultimately there is no direct harm in taking homeopathic products ( as all 1023 campaigners have proven today ) , but there is harm in taking these products instead of seeking medical advice .
Particularly if they have an ailment where earlier diagnosis can make the difference , or affect long - term health or even life .
They may feel better taking these pills for a little while , but eventually even they ’ll stop working as the problem gets worse and by then it may well be too late .
But I ’m not trying to convince you of anything that ’s not provable or measurable .
Do your own research and come to your own conclusions — even if a thousand or more skeptics around the world ‘ overdosing ’ on homeopathic products is n’t enough to convince you ( for some Twilight Zone reason ) .
Perhaps pick up a book by an actual scientist and medical doctor , and examine what research they ’ve done to research their conclusions .
I ’d highly recommend Bad Science by Ben Goldacre ( Amazon or Amazon UK ) , as it ’s very readable , full of information ( including this topic ) , and it ’s all supportable by evidence .

Homeopathy : There ’s Nothing In It !
It ’s only a matter of time before the rest of the homeopathy industry worldwide admit the same or begin circling the wagons .
Either way , the truth is now public knowledge and we should see less of this :

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil supply and demand fundamentals have returned to take the reins from external financial factors in driving the market , the International Energy Agency said on Friday .
“ The oil price correlation with macroeconomic factors and financial market activity that has marked most of 2009 may be weakening as supply and demand fundamentals reasserted more control over price direction , ” the Paris - based agency said in its monthly oil market report .
For most of 2009 , oil prices have reacted to macroeconomic figures , such as jobs data , and other markets such as currency and equity as demand remained weak throughout the year .
The IEA , adviser to 28 industrialised nations , said it expected oil demand growth , to be led by China , to put a floor on oil prices , pushing up long - dated U.S. crude futures above $ 100 a barrel , while the prompt oil prices have been around $ 70 - $ 75 in December .
It also said the large volume of oil products stored at sea despite a sizable idled refining capacity is capping a significant rise in prompt oil prices .

A week ago I published the Perl Editor and IDE Poll results and Adam Kennedy wrote about his plans with Strawberry Perl for Windows .
It was strange to see several people trying to fiercely defend vi or emacs from these GUI based IDE people .
I know many people feel strongly that their editor of choice is the best and everybody should use it but I do n't think so .
I do n't even think that everyone should use Padre .
The reason I wanted to run this poll is not to evaluate how Padre scores compared to other editors but to have some food for thought for the Padre developers regarding what kind of editors people are using .
The 3 % that Padre got does not mean much either but I was happy to see more than 100 people marking it .
So we know there are at least 100 people who use it part of their time or that want us to feel good .
So what did I learn from it ?
I am quite sure that we wo n't see many vim or emacs users switch to Padre as Padre does not fit their standard use - case .
Some of them might play with Padre for the fun of it and in some cases they might even use Padre for certain tasks but that 's not really the market of Padre .
( Although I saw many people who use vim despite not knowing it at all and struggling with it all the time .
You can't really exploit the power of vim using two fingers !
I think these people would be better off with Gedit or Padre . )
One of the main targets we have is people new to Perl but they were not included in the poll so we can't talk about them here .
Then again some of the comments during the poll suggested that people using other programming languages will tend to use vi or emacs a lot less than perl programmers .
Among the current Perl users our primary target is the people using programmer editors such as Ultra Edit , Notepad ++ , TextPad on Windows or editors like Kate or Gedit on Linux .
I think TextMate and BBEdit users will be already harder to convince .
Beyond that are the IDE users , mainly Komodo and Eclipse +EPIC .
Feature wise Padre is more or less at the same level as Notepad ++ , TextPad or Gedit .
In the non-Perl related areas those editors might still have some advantages but for Perl development Padre already has a number of feature those do n't have .
So what stops people using those editor from switching to Padre ?
One thing I guess is the fact that we hardly promoted Padre beyond our blogs .
Only recently we started to offer an easy Padre installer for Windows and there still is some confusion as people are afraid it will interfere with their currently installed version of Perl .
There might be some minor issues but mostly they work well together .
So even people who use ActivePerl 5.6.x could download the Stand Alone Padre and work with it .
I do n't know much about TextMate and BBEdit but unless some Mac users join the Padre team we wo n't be able to do much about those .
Komodo and Eclipse are still beyond our reach .
Maybe next month .
Further polls
It 's only an assumption but I am quite sure the people who answered that poll are much closer to the Perl community than the average Perl user .
I also think that these " community people " tend to be more Unix / Linux oriented and more " hard core " than the average Perl user .
In order to evaluate better what market share the various editors and IDEs really have we will need a longer survey that will collect information on various other parameters such as Operating Systems , experience level in Perl , amount of weekly Perl usage , job description , industry the person works in and even involvement in the Perl community .
A going concern since 1901 , Editor & Publisher -- " America 's Oldest Journal Covering the Newspaper Industry " -- is going away at a time when that industry continues to get smaller by the day .
From a memo issued this morning by the publication 's owner , Nielsen Business Media :
We 've made the decision to cease operations for Editor & Publisher and Kirkus Reviews .
This move will allow us to strengthen investment in our core businesses - those parts of our portfolio that have the greatest potential for growth - and ensure our long - term success .
As I type , the news has yet to appear on the E & P Web site , although the causes can be seen throughout the all - too - familiar headlines there -- " Tampa Editor , Now Exiting , Had Stayed On To Help Amid Staff Cuts ; " " Guild Unit Chair Among ' New York Times ' Buyout Takers ; " -- as well as others that show a defiant if less than plausible optimism : " Gannett : Readership , Revenue ' Bouncing Back ' ; " " Tampa Tribune ' Parent Sees Ad Spending ' Firming . "
Or , as a Talking Points Memo reader reacting to the E&P news puts it : " Everybody loves to read it ; no one wants to pay for it . "
Having spent more than 20 years in the newspaper industry before joining Network World , it pains me enormously to see what is happening to the institution of print journalism , and now , to the long - time chronicler of that institution .
Those media bashers who gloat over these losses are sadly misinformed , and , in some cases , cruelly oblivious to the pain being suffered by journalists and their families .
Those who believe these losses wo n't matter are simply wrong .
( Update : The E&P site has now reported its own demise , ironically enough , complete with a typo : " Editor & Publisher , the bible of the newspaper industry and a journalism instutution that traces its origins back to 1884 , is shutting down , following an announcement by parent company The Nielsen Co. - December 10 , 2009 12:13 PM ET . )
( Update 2 : This is from E&P 's own story about its closing and hints at a glimmer of hope : " The expressions of surprise and outpouring of strong support for E&P that has followed across the Web -- Editor & Publisher has even hit No. 4 as a Twitter trending topic -- raises the notion that the publication might yet continue in some form . " )
We just posted a new video on the Website Optimizer YouTube channel that shows the power of website testing .
Last month , we held our annual Google Partner Summit where we hosted all of the Google Analytics , Website Optimizer , and Urchin Software Authorized Consultants .
One of the keynote speakers was Dan Siroker , Director of Analytics for the Obama Presidential campaign .
In his 50 minute talk , Dan explained how they used data to win the election .
He shows how they used tools like Google Analytics and Website Optimizer to get more engagement and more donations .
He also describes the lessons that they learned throughout the campaign .
With the successful election behind him , Dan is now focused on his startup , CarrotSticks , and he explains how he 's using the same principles within his own company .
Plasma jets capable of obliterating tooth decay - causing bacteria could be an effective and less painful alternative to the dentist 's drill , according to a new study published in the February issue of the Journal of Medical Microbiology .
Firing low temperature plasma beams at dentin - the fibrous tooth structure underneath the enamel coating - was found to reduce the amount of dental bacteria by up to 10,000 - fold .
The findings could mean plasma technology is used to remove infected tissue in tooth cavities - a practice that conventionally involves drilling into the tooth .
Scientists at the Leibniz - Institute of Surface Modifications , Leipzig and dentists from the Saarland University , Homburg , Germany , tested the effectiveness of plasma against common oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei .
These bacteria form films on the surface of teeth and are capable of eroding tooth enamel and the dentin below it to cause cavities .
If left untreated it can lead to pain , tooth loss and sometimes severe gum infections .
In this study , the researchers infected dentin from extracted human molars with four strains of bacteria and then exposed it to plasma jets for 6 , 12 or 18 seconds .
The longer the dentin was exposed to the plasma the greater the amount of bacteria that were eliminated .
Plasmas are known as the fourth state of matter after solids , liquids and gases and have an increasing number of technical and medical applications .
Plasmas are common everywhere in the cosmos , and are produced when high - energy processes strip atoms of one or more of their electrons .
This forms high - temperature reactive oxygen species that are capable of destroying microbes .
These hot plasmas are already used to disinfect surgical instruments .
Dr Stefan Rupf from Saarland University who led the research said that the recent development of cold plasmas that have temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius showed great promise for use in dentistry .
" The low temperature means they can kill the microbes while preserving the tooth .
The dental pulp at the centre of the tooth , underneath the dentin , is linked to the blood supply and nerves and heat damage to it must be avoided at all costs . "
Dr Rupf said using plasma technology to disinfect tooth cavities would be welcomed by patients as well as dentists .
" Drilling is a very uncomfortable and sometimes painful experience .
Cold plasma , in contrast , is a completely contact - free method that is highly effective .
Presently , there is huge progress being made in the field of plasma medicine and a clinical treatment for dental cavities can be expected within 3 to 5 years . "

2020-05-01 - Qt Port in Progress
A beta version of Code Browser for Qt is available for download .
It 's stable enough to be released , but a graphical user interface is never a simple thing , expect quirks with inputs , keyboard focus or display .
Everything is implemented except the support of primary selection and the single application mode .
Filename Description code - browser -7.1.20-linux-x64-qt.tar.gz Qt Linux x64 binaries code - browser -7.1.20-src.tar.gz
The source code ( tar gz format )
The Windows version still uses the native API , it does not use Qt yet .
The GtK+ version will still be available on next releases .
As always , feedback is welcome .
If you 're interested on the why and how , I 've created a page about the Qt port .
2020-03-21 - Code Browser 7.1 Released
This release fixes several issues related to GTK3 and add an " Open Folder " feature : it 's possible to open a window on any folder without opening a project .
2020 -02-17 - Code Browser 7.0 Released
Few major changes .
Unified View
The directories , files and sections of a project are not visible in a single hierarchy : when you open a project view ( ALT+J ) , it opens a new window showing the directories , the files and also the sections in files .
Zoomable View
The zoomable view is now part of the official release .
Other Stuff
The keyboard navigation in the browser view is improved : Up / Down and Page Up / Down can go the previous or next sibling section .
The page view has been removed , it can not work with the integrated project view .
Notes
It is a major release but the v6 configuration files and scripts can be reused as is .
It is a major release not because of major changes but rather because of the removal of the page view .
More releases should follow soon as the merge of folders and sections into a single hierarchy gave me new ideas :
Ged Maheux of the Iconfactory recently wrote Losing iReligion , in which he criticizes the business prospects of the App Store .
He cites some general concerns , but much of the post is based on the unfortunate commercial failure of their Ramp Champ game .
By Ged ’s account , Ramp Champ was developed with a sizable budget and marketing push ( not relative to most games , but relative to most iPhone apps ) :
When the Iconfactory & DS Media Labs released our latest iPhone game , Ramp Champ , we knew that we had to try and maximize exposure of the application at launch .
We poured hundreds of hours into the game ’s development and pulled out all the stops to not only make it beautiful and fun , but also something Apple would be proud to feature in the App Store .
We designed an attractive website for the game , showed it to as many high - profile bloggers as we could prior to launch and made sure in - app purchases were compelling and affordable .
Subjectively , I remember seeing massive build - up for it from the people I follow online .
It was clearly a major effort .
But it has apparently failed :
The lack of store front exposure combined with a sporadic 3G crashing bug conspired to keep Ramp Champ down for the count .
… Ramp Champ ’s sales have not lived up to expectations for either the Iconfactory or DS Media Labs .
What ’s worse , many of the future plans for the game ( network play , online score boards , frequent add - on pack releases ) are all in jeopardy because of the simple fact that Ramp Champ has n’t returned on its investment .
Its sales could have been disappointing for any number of reasons .
Maybe people just did n’t like the gameplay , which presents carnival Skee - Ball - style ball - rolling , target - knocking - down action with extremely strong , detailed graphics and atmosphere .
But , as Ged points out , Freeverse ’s Skee - Ball has been successful , and it ’s a very similar type of game .
Simplistic gameplay does n’t prevent iPhone games from being successful — in fact , it usually helps .
One of the most popular recent games is Paper Toss , a game so simple and mindless that watching someone play it on the subway made me lose much faith in humanity .
What happened ?
As usual , I have a theory : there are two App Stores .
App Store A : Simple , shallow games and apps with mass - market appeal .
These live and die by the App Store ’s “ Top ” lists , so success is difficult to achieve and is short - lived at best , but with the largest potential payoff for the lucky few at the top .
These apps are developed quickly and cheaply , and are rarely updated once their initial popularity ( if any ) dies down .
Very few are priced above $ 0.99 .
Impulse - buying is king , with most purchases happening on the phone itself , and most buyers do n’t know or cares whether you ’re an established developer unless your name begins with “ MLB ” .
Nearly every best - selling app falls into this category .
App Store B : Apps and games with more complexity and depth , narrower appeal , longer development cycles , and developer maintenance over the long term .
These tend to get little attention from the “ Top ” lists , instead relying on the much - lower - volume App Store features ( e.g. “ Staff Picks ” ) , blogs , reviews , and word of mouth .
More of their customers notice and demand great design and polish .
More sales come from people who have heard of your product first and seek it out by name .
Many of these apps are priced above $ 0.99 .
These are unlikely to have giant bursts of sales , and hardly any will come close to matching the revenue of the high - profile success stories , but they have a much greater chance of building sustained , long - term income .
Due to the likely lower revenue cap , these are usually developed on small budgets by individuals who can do most or all of the work themselves .
These two stores exist in completely different ecosystems with completely different requirements , priorities , and best practices .
But they ’re not two different stores ( “ Are you getting it ? ” ) .
There ’s just one App Store at a casual glance , but if you misunderstand which of these segments you ’re targeting , you ’ll have a very hard time getting anywhere .
The Iconfactory seems entirely set up for producing excellent apps for App Store B .
Their most well - known app , Twitterrific , is solidly in that camp .
The problem with Ramp Champ is that they targeted App Store A in gameplay depth and type ( which may not have been intentional ) , and budgeted for App Store A ’s expected sales for a hit .
But they built , designed , and promoted it as if they were targeting App Store B .
Freeverse ’s Skee - Ball game targeted App Store A , but in a way that ’s more likely to appeal to its more simplistic , impulse - oriented demands , starting with the name and icon :
Skee - Ball is a registered trademark that the Iconfactory did n’t license ( Freeverse did ) , so the Iconfactory could n’t call theirs by that name , make the game look anything like it , or even mention it anywhere in the description .
But that ’s how most people know this sort of game .
App Store
A ’s customers do n’t read our blogs .
They do n’t see the professional reviews .
They also do n’t see the Staff Picks section in the store because it ’s not in the phone version .
Your only chance to get these customers is with the “ Top ” and category lists , so you need to get them quickly and efficiently .
When they breezed past “ Ramp Champ ” in the low - information list view , they probably could n’t tell what it was .
The primary screenshots of each game also show a clear difference for people who did select either app for more information :
Skee - Ball is immediately recognizable , well - known , and obvious .
But Ramp Champ looks likely to lose out on nearly every impulse purchase from people who do n’t want to spend much time looking into it — which is nearly every buyer for App Store A .
The Iconfactory ’s apps are able to compete strongly when people choose apps based on research , reviews , or feature comparisons .
But that ’s not how App Store A ’s customers operate .
Whether Ramp Champ is a better game than Skee - Ball is irrelevant to them because they ’ll never take the time to find out .
Many of Ged ’s complaints — in fact , many of everyone ’s complaints relating to App Store economics , promotion , and ranking — only apply to App Store A .
He ’s right to condemn the practical economics of it and question whether to invest significant resources into it again .
But App Store B is doing fine .
It ’s remarkably stable .
This is the store I live in with Instapaper and happily share with many extremely talented developers , including Loren , James , Adam and Cameron , Jeff and Garrett , and — unquestionably — the Iconfactory .
We enjoy great advantages by targeting App Store B :
Customers are much less price - sensitive .
Mainstream press is much more likely to review our apps .
We do n’t need to care about our ranks in the “ Top ” lists .
Our App
Store user reviews and star ratings are much less relevant .
Promotion in the App Store is a happy bonus if it happens , not a necessity that we depend on .
Income is much more steady .
It occasionally spikes upward with promotion , but the decline afterward is slow and predictable .
Since we can predict a reasonably accurate revenue minimum for at least a few months , we can afford to issue updates indefinitely , invest in new functionality , and polish the hell out of our product .
There are also , of course , some disadvantages :
Apps are easy to position here , but games are much more difficult .
Games tend to have much higher initial - investment requirements and can’t command as high of a price .
But they can much more easily charge for upgrades , and people burn through them more quickly and therefore demand more of them .
It ’s extremely difficult for anyone with employees , or any individuals without other income , to afford to be here .
Some people can make enough to cover full - time expenses , but most can’t .
( Although I ’d say the same thing about the entire App Store , really — at least in our section , we do n’t delude ourselves into thinking we ’ll be the next Flight Control . )
Personally , I would never trade this for the hit - driven , high - risk , quick - flip requirements of the mass market , even if it means that I ’ll never be profiled in Newsweek for making hundreds of thousands of dollars in a few months with the App Store .
TORONTO , Canada —
Some years ago , in the heyday of cigarette smuggling , I found myself in a speedboat bouncing on the St. Lawrence River at 65 mph , heading to the Akwesasne Indian reserve that straddles the Canada - U.S. border .
Behind the wheel was a young French Canadian named Pierre , who described himself as a mid-size player in a billion dollar game .
He smuggled 275 cases of cigarettes a week , each case filled with 50 cartons of smokes .
In six months , he had made $ 100,000 .
( Note : Money in this story is in Canadian dollars . )
He set up our first meeting in a raunchy strip bar in Sainte Barbe , a small Quebec town on the south shore of the St. Lawrence .
After a few beers he took me for a white - knuckle ride on the river , his speedboat bounding through the black void of a moonless night .
I passed some kind of a test :
The next day , I was on a smuggling run for a story on the underground business .
“ If you mention my real name , ” he said , “ I 'll end up at the bottom of the lake — and you 're going to join me . ”
On the Canadian side of Akwesasne , Pierre pulled into a waterway lined with tall grass .
He stopped at a makeshift dock , where one of his employees waited in another boat .
Minutes later , a van blaring rock music and an SUV with tinted windows backed up to the dock .
Three young aboriginal men stepped out , opened their trunks and filled the two boats with 34 cases of Rothmans , Mark Ten and Export A — each case stacked with 400 packs of contraband smokes .
For some reason , the aboriginal in charge of the operation then threw a smoke bomb in the water and laughed hysterically as smoke billowed .
Seemed to me a great way to attract cops .
A wad of money exchanged hands .
Pierre sped back to the Quebec side of the shore and unloaded the cigarettes into a waiting van for distribution in Montreal .
From start to finish , the operation took less than an hour .
“ Now you 're a smuggler , too , ” he said to me , before heading off for another run .
Smuggling slowed down in the late 1990s after the Quebec and Ontario governments cut taxes , thereby significantly reducing the price of store - bought packs .
But in the last six years , the illegal trade has come back with a vengeance .
The black market in cigarettes is believed to be a $ 1.5 billion industry in Canada .
The Ontario government estimates that half of all cigarettes sold in the province are illegal .
In neighboring Quebec , that number is 40 percent .
Contraband smokes cost the federal and provincial governments more than $ 2 billion in lost taxes .
In the 1990s , tobacco companies were accused of aiding and abetting the smuggling .
In 2008 , Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and Rothmans , Benson & Hedges pleaded guilty to helping people sell or possess illegal cigarettes during the previous decade .
They paid a total of $ 1.15 billion to the federal government and 10 provincial governments in fines and settlements .
This time around , tobacco companies have their hands clean .
The source of the smuggling , say Canadian police officials , are Indian - owned cigarette manufacturers on reserves in Ontario and Quebec .
But the most important source , they add , is the Mohawk community of St. Regis on the New York state side of Akwesasne .
Police say organized crime groups — from the mob to biker gangs like the Hells Angels — are also involved in the trade .
Guns and drugs are smuggled along with cigarettes .
In 2008 , 1,079,529 cartons of illegal cigarettes were seized by the national police — their biggest take ever .
That was a 73 percent increase from 2007 .
On the streets of Montreal a pack of illegal smokes can cost as little as $ 1 , compared to $ 9 for legal ones at convenience stores .
A sharp drop in legal cigarette sales is partly responsible for one convenience store a day going out of business in Quebec .
Cigarette companies are also worried about lost revenues .
But that has n’t cut them much slack with provincial governments .
In September , Ontario ’s government filed a $ 50 billion lawsuit against tobacco companies to recover the costs of treating residents with smoking - related illnesses since 1955 .
Quebec is poised to launch a $ 30 billion lawsuit for the same reasons .
The Ontario suit names 14 cigarette companies and their multinational parents , including Philip Morris USA , Altria Group and JTI - Macdonald Corp .
Ontario ’s Attorney General , Chris Bentley , said the province spends $ 1.6 billion a year treating people with illnesses related to smoking , such as cancer and heart disease .
There are about 13,000 smoking related deaths every year in Ontario .
Cigarette companies have denounced the lawsuits as the hypocritical actions of governments happy to collect taxes from cigarette sales while also operating casinos and selling alcohol , which create their own addictive behaviors .
About 18 percent of Canadians today are smokers , compared to 25 percent in 1999 .
But anti-smoking groups say the proliferation of cheap , illegal cigarettes is slowing the decline .
Last May , the Canadian and U.S. governments signed an agreement for joint coast guard patrols on shared waterways to increase border security and crack down on smuggling .
They ’re up against a lucrative trade where , for now at least , the money comes easy .

' I measure people more so on what they do rather than the things they say , ' Michelle Obama said .
FLOTUS : Reid owes me no apology
First lady Michelle Obama told reporters Wednesday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid does n’t owe her an apology over his racial comments about her husband ’s electoral chances because she knows Reid so well .
“ Harry Reid has no need to apologize to me because I know Harry Reid .
I measure people more so on what they do rather than the things they say , ” said Obama , in a roundtable with several media outlets , including POLITICO .

On Reid , Michelle Obama seemed interested in closing the book , much as the president had when he accepted Reid ’s apologies for the “ unfortunate ” comments .
Reid had said that Obama 's presidential candidacy was viable because he is " light skinned " and has no " Negro dialect , unless he wants to . "
In the wide - ranging interview , Michelle Obama discussed her upcoming campaign to curb childhood obesity and life in the White House , saying she ’s proud that " my kids are sane . "
" I'm happy that when I look at my daughters , I recognize them as the kids that they were before we got here , " Obama said of her daughters Sasha and Malia .
She also discussed the Nov. 24 state dinner where three alleged party - crashers got in , including two who met President Barack Obama .
Michelle Obama downplayed the incident , which raised serious concerns about White House security and Secret Service practices , calling it a “ footnote ” to a successful night .
“ The state dinner was an outstanding success , you know , it ’s just the follow - up after it .
I look at the reporting on the state dinner , and go , ‘ Is that all that happened really ?
It was so wonderful and so well orchestrated .
For me the other stuff that everyone is talking about is a footnote . ”
The party - crashing incident also cast a harsh light on social secretary Desiree Rogers , whose office failed to post someone at the entrance gate .
But asked about Rogers in the interview , Obama seemed to defend her friend from Chicago , without mentioning her by name .
“ Our interaction around security has been outstanding .
The White House and Secret Service are working to make sure that processes are in place so it never happens again . ”
And , she added in an apparent reference to Rogers , “ When I say White House , I mean everyone in the White House . ”
Procedures have changed since the security breach that apparently allowed three uninvited guests into the White House , and the Secret Service is still investigating the incident .
Looking ahead to 2010 , Obama said she will use her platform to fight childhood obesity , saying she hopes combating the problem will be an important part of her legacy .
Her foray into policy marks the first time Obama has led an administrative - wide program , though she said her first year has been about " laying a foundation for a whole set of initiatives . "
The initiative will include speeches and travel and Obama said she would be interested in taking her case to Congress if that would be helpful .
" People are receptive because we are talking about kids , " she said .
Next week she will address the Conference of Mayors on the topic and in February officially kick off her work around childhood obesity issues , which is a natural outgrowth of the “ kitchen garden ” on the White House grounds .
Congress will take up school - lunch legislation that could increase funding and food safety and eliminate junk food and trans - fats from menus .
" The garden and this first year was really a good way to begin that conversation in a non-threatening way to feel the pulse of the nation , about how do we talk about this in a way that does n't make already over - stressed parents feel even more guilty about a very hard thing to do , which is making sure your kids eat right every day , " Obama said .
Some first lady observers have said that Obama 's approach to issues have been scatter - shot rather than focused and as a result , possibly blunting her impact .
In the last year she has given a handful of speeches on healthcare , joined with Jill Biden in highlighting the needs of military families , advocated for healthy living , kicked off a mentoring program , and transformed the White House into a showcase for culture , acting as a kind of unofficial arts czar .
On Thursday , she will continue her thank - you tour of agencies , delivering remarks to Labor Department employees and reading to children .
Her signature event has been planting the garden on the White House lawn with a group of elementary school children .
Now she hopes her fight against childhood obesity will help her leave her mark .
" I want to leave something behind that you can say because of this time that this person spent here this has changed and we hope that 's going to be in the area of childhood obesity , " she said .
If there is one near universal gripe folks have with the Kindle , it 's the DRM - laden files .
It 's no wonder , then , that the thing has been a lightning rod for the " information wants to be free crowd , " almost since the beginning .
Sure , we 've seen Mobipocket .epub , and .pdf files used on the device , but if you really want to bedevil Bezos the thing to do would be to altogether circumvent the DRM from your Amazon e-books -- and it looks like an Israeli hacker named Labba has done just that .
For the time being , the hack , which allows you to convert your legally obtained e-books to unencrypted PDF files , is available as a Python script .
We 're sure that the process will be streamlined for us civilians soon enough -- let 's just hope that it happens before the hole gets plugged and your e-reader auto -updated .
This is one way to keep hold of your legally purchased Orwell , eh ?
The Rhode Island Legislature overrode a governor veto on Tuesday to approve a bill that gives gay couples the same rights to plan the funerals of their late partners as married couples , the Telegraph reported .
Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the bill , with only 3 members of each chamber voting against the measure .
Governor Donald Carcieri , a Republican , vetoed the bill in November , saying the legislation would erode heterosexual marriage .
The bill also includes unmarried heterosexual couples .
“ If the General Assembly believes it would like to address the issue of domestic partnership , it should place the issue on the ballot and let the people of the State of Rhode Island decide , ” the governor said in a letter to lawmakers .
Carcieri , who will be term - limited out of office next year , remains a major obstacle to passing a gay marriage bill in Rhode Island , which lawmakers have considered for the last 13 years .
The governor also backs an effort to place a gay marriage ban in the Rhode Island Constitution .
And in the spring , he and his wife , Sue , joined the state 's newly minted chapter of the National Organization for Marriage , the nation 's most vociferous opponent of gay marriage .
Rhode Island is the only New England state that does not recognize gay unions .
Massachusetts , Vermont , New Hampshire and Connecticut have legalized gay marriage .
Maine offers a limited domestic partnership for gay couples .
A couple must be at least 18 , have lived together for one year and prove they were financially dependent – sharing a bank account would suffice – to qualify for the funeral planning rights .
For decades , debate over whether to limit global population growth was stifled or ignored , branded as immoral and a return to heartless Malthusian logic .
But the potential impact on climate change of a planet teaming with up to 10 billion souls has again forced the issue into the open ahead of the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in December .
In a sign of change , the UN Population Fund ( UNFPA ) has declared that braking the rise in Earth 's population would be a major contribution to fighting greenhouse gases .
" Slower population growth ... would help build social resilience to climate change 's impacts and would contribute to a reduction of greenhouse - gas emissions in the future , " the agency said in report in November .
If , by 2050 , Earth 's population stood at eight billion rather than nine billion , that would save between one and two gigatonnes of carbon per year , buying precious time for cleaner technology and other policies , its report said .
China 's state news channel has blamed hugely popular online games for problems including drug addiction , teen pregnancy and even murder this month as regulators crack down on allegedly harmful content in games .
In a program titled " Confession of a Murderer -- Focus on Pornography and Violence in Online Games ( Part Two ) , " China Central Television ( CCTV ) on Thursday reported on a Beijing juvenile prison where one man was serving a life sentence for murders he committed to obtain virtual equipment in an online game .
Up to 80 percent of the violent criminals in the prison turned to crime because of online games , the report said .
" He himself killed five people , and the reason he took the path to crime was addiction to violent online games , " it said .
The program follows other CCTV reports this month that have blamed social ills on online games and given voice to concerns among some Chinese parents that excessive time spent on games and social - networking sites is interfering with their children 's schoolwork .
The reports , which also come amid a wide - reaching government campaign against Internet pornography , show how erratic political conditions can threaten companies operating in China .
Chinese regulators this year have shut down dozens of online games designed overseas and ordered developers to stop including " lowbrow " content like monster - hunting in games .
A struggle between government agencies for the right to regulate online games has further roiled the industry and helped send the hit game World of Warcraft offline for three months earlier this year .
Chinese state media have long criticized online games .
The last installment of the CCTV series told the story of a 14 - year - old girl purportedly influenced by an online dancing game to start having sex with people she met online .
The game , called " Audition , " was said to encourage one - night stands and the girl to have had two abortions .
CCTV this month also aired a report on teenagers who became addicted to cough medicine and then drugs like methamphetamine as a way to keep their energy up during all - night gaming marathons .
The boys were said to spend their time in Internet cafes , which are often filled with chain - smoking young men using instant - messaging programs and playing online games .
China has the largest number of Internet users in any country with at least 338 million people online .
Over 210 million of those people play online games , according to a government survey .
Although the widespread adoption of electric vehicles and their related infrastructure has always suffered from chicken - and - egg syndrome , Nissan and FedEx , along with several utilities and technology companies have formed a coalition to break the stalemate .
At a press conference Monday in Washington , D.C. , the Electrification Coalition announced its formation as well as a new 130 - page report on the dangers of oil dependence , the benefits of electric vehicles , and ways to overcome roadblocks that have kept these vehicles from being deployed en masse .
Sixty percent of the petroleum used by the U.S. daily comes from foreign sources , FedEx CEO Fred Smith said at the launch event , adding that 90 percent of all U.S. transportation is petroleum - powered .
Smith made clear his position that reliance on foreign oil is " in no small way related " to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
This energy mentality has to change because the U.S. 's dependence on foreign oil has created what amounts to a security risk for the country as a whole , said Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D–N.D. ) , who also spoke at Monday 's event .
The coalition 's position is that a move to electric vehicles would help the U.S. combat the economic , environmental and national security vulnerabilities caused by the country 's petroleum dependence .
The coalition 's " Electrification Roadmap " report predicts that if by 2040 , 75 percent of light - duty vehicle miles traveled in the U.S. are covered by electric vehicles , oil consumption in that fleet would be reduced by more than 75 percent , and " U.S. crude oil imports could effectively be reduced to zero . "
The coalition estimates there will be 2.5 billion vehicles on the planet by 2050 , up from 600 million this year .
Smith pointed out that the continued economic development of India , China and Brazil will lead to a " staggering increase " in the number of vehicles on the world 's roads .
If they are powered by internal combustion engines , " we are on an unsustainable path , " he added .
" When you look at the alternatives that are available , electrification of short - haul transportation becomes the only viable alternative . "
Smith acknowledged that electric vehicle owners , including his own company , pay a premium today for their fleets — whereas a hybrid pickup and delivery van costs about $ 90,000 , FedEx can buy a diesel vehicle for about $ 60,000 .
The problem with mass - producing the number of electric vehicles that would drive down costs has always been the standoff among carmakers , consumers and utilities — none of which are willing to invest in the technology until they are sure it is ready to meet their needs , both logistically and economically .
" Car companies have not wanted to build cars in bulk for infrastructures that do n't exist , while infrastructure companies such as ourselves do n't want to build infrastructures for cars that do n't exist , " said David Crane , chief executive of coalition member NRG Energy , Inc. Still , the risk of doing nothing has become apparent .
For 2008 the U.S. net trade deficit in crude oil and petroleum products was $ 388 billion , Crane said , adding , " I do n't think anyone in America is happy about that . "
Legislation to control carbon emissions , public concern over the environment , and high gas prices are driving the demand for electric vehicles , said Carlos Ghosn , chief executive of coalition member Nissan Motor Co. , whose all - electric Leaf is set to debut in the U.S. in 2010 ( although it will not be widely available until 2012 ) .
The coalition 's proposed solution is in part to deploy fleets of 100,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles in six to eight U.S. cities that can invest in the necessary infrastructure .
If this limited investment of resources leads to increased interest in driving electric cars , the coalition hopes to expand its program to 20 or 25 cities .
Although the coalition did not reveal which urban areas it is planning to use as its initial test bed , the U.S. Department of Energy has already promised to provide $ 99.8 million to a project led by Electric Transportation Engineering Corporation ( eTec ) , a subsidiary of Scottsdale , Ariz . – based ECOtality ( not a member of the coalition ) , for installation of up to 12,750 charging stations across five markets : Tennessee , Oregon , San Diego , Seattle and the Phoenix–Tucson region .
The project also includes the deployment of up to 1,000 Nissan Leafs in each market .
Coalition test runs in the selected cities will also provide the parties involved with a better understanding of just how extensive the infrastructure needs to be , not to mention how much it will cost .
There may not be a need for that many fast - charging stations , given that 90 percent of Americans drive fewer than 65 kilometers each day , Crane noted .
He pointed to a project in Tokyo where the installation of fast charging stations throughout the city boosted electric vehicle use , even though the stations were hardly ever used .
In the end , the drivers themselves will make the final judgment on whether electric vehicles succeed , Dorgan said .
The image of the rugged American cruising along in a gas - guzzling vehicles transposed against the stereotype of bookish hybrid drivers has been an impediment to electric vehicle adoption .
" There 's been a notion that real men dig and drill , " the senator said , " but I think things have changed a lot . "

Voyager flies through the outer bounds of the heliosphere en route to interstellar space .
A strong magnetic field reported by Opher et al in the Dec. 24 , 2009 , issue of Nature is delineated in yellow .

The solar system is passing through an interstellar cloud that physics says should not exist .
In the Dec. 24th issue of Nature , a team of scientists reveal how NASA 's Voyager spacecraft have solved the mystery .
" Using data from Voyager , we have discovered a strong magnetic field just outside the solar system , " explains lead author Merav Opher , a NASA Heliophysics Guest Investigator from George Mason University .
" This magnetic field holds the interstellar cloud together and solves the long - standing puzzle of how it can exist at all . "
An artist 's concept of the Local Interstellar Cloud , also known as the " Local Fluff . "

The discovery has implications for the future when the solar system will eventually bump into other , similar clouds in our arm of the Milky Way galaxy .
Astronomers call the cloud we 're running into now the Local Interstellar Cloud or " Local Fluff " for short .
It 's about 30 light years wide and contains a wispy mixture of hydrogen and helium atoms at a temperature of 6000 C .
The existential mystery of the Fluff has to do with its surroundings .
About 10 million years ago , a cluster of supernovas exploded nearby , creating a giant bubble of million - degree gas .
The Fluff is completely surrounded by this high - pressure supernova exhaust and should be crushed or dispersed by it .
" The observed temperature and density of the local cloud do not provide enough pressure to resist the ' crushing action ' of the hot gas around it , " says Opher .
So how does the Fluff survive ?
The Voyagers have found an answer .
" Voyager data show that the Fluff is much more strongly magnetized than anyone had previously suspected — between 4 and 5 microgauss * , " says Opher .
" This magnetic field can provide the extra pressure required to resist destruction . "
NASA 's two Voyager probes have been racing out of the solar system for more than 30 years .
They are now beyond the orbit of Pluto and on the verge of entering interstellar space — but they are not there yet .
" The Voyagers are not actually inside the Local Fluff , " says Opher .
" But they are getting close and can sense what the cloud is like as they approach it . "
The anatomy of the heliosphere .
Since this illustration was made , Voyager 2 has joined Voyager 1 inside the heliosheath , a thick outer layer where the solar wind is slowed by the pressure of interstellar gas .
Credit : NASA / Walt Feimer .
The Fluff is held at bay just beyond the edge of the solar system by the sun 's magnetic field , which is inflated by solar wind into a magnetic bubble more than 10 billion km wide .
Called the " heliosphere , " this bubble acts as a shield that helps protect the inner solar system from galactic cosmic rays and interstellar clouds .
The two Voyagers are located in the outermost layer of the heliosphere , or " heliosheath , " where the solar wind is slowed by the pressure of interstellar gas .
Voyager 1 entered the heliosheath in Dec. 2004 ; Voyager 2 followed almost 3 years later in Aug. 2007 .
These crossings were key to Opher et al 's discovery .
The size of the heliosphere is determined by a balance of forces : Solar wind inflates the bubble from the inside while the Local Fluff compresses it from the outside .
Voyager 's crossings into the heliosheath revealed the approximate size of the heliosphere and , thus , how much pressure the Local Fluff exerts .
A portion of that pressure is magnetic and corresponds to the ~5 microgauss Opher 's team has reported in Nature .
The fact that the Fluff is strongly magnetized means that other clouds in the galactic neighborhood could be , too .
Eventually , the solar system will run into some of them , and their strong magnetic fields could compress the heliosphere even more than it is compressed now .
Additional compression could allow more cosmic rays to reach the inner solar system , possibly affecting terrestrial climate and the ability of astronauts to travel safely through space .
On the other hand , astronauts would n't have to travel so far because interstellar space would be closer than ever .
These events would play out on time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years , which is how long it takes for the solar system to move from one cloud to the next .
" There could be interesting times ahead ! " says Opher .

* Lawmakers challenge Geithner ’s credibility over AIG
* One Republican calls for Geithner to resign
* Former Treasury chief Paulson backs AIG rescue
* Republican says Geithner ’s defense ‘ strains credulity ’
( Adds testimony by special inspector general , analyst quote )
By Glenn Somerville and David Lawder
WASHINGTON , Jan 27 ( Reuters ) - U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday challenged Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s credibility after he said he was not involved in AIG ’s decision to withhold details on $ 62 billion the bailed - out insurer paid to banks .
Geithner held his ground at a hearing , however , insisting the government - funded rescue which cost more than $ 180 billion had been necessary to avert an economic collapse .
Big taxpayer - funded bailouts for AIG and other financial institutions at a time of soaring unemployment have angered voters .
Economic worries helped put a Republican into a Senate seat long - held by Democrats in Massachusetts last week , serving notice to lawmakers facing reelection in November .
“ Why should n’t we ask for your resignation as secretary of the Treasury ? ” Florida Republican John Mica demanded .
“ I think you ’re punting the blame ... I believe we ’re not getting the whole story . ”
The populist backlash has heaped pressure on Geithner and threatened to scuttle Ben Bernanke ’s bid for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve -- the U.S. central bank .
Both men are architects of the financial rescue .
“ It was a circus and what I saw I thought Geithner handled it well and that the adults on Capitol Hill will recognize that , ” said Kevin Krueger , an analyst with Concept Capital in Washington .
Democrats and Republicans alike expressed doubt Geithner , who led the New York Federal Reserve Bank at the time , could have been in the dark over a decision by American International Group Inc AIG .
N not to disclose for months details of billions of dollars the insurer paid banks to settle swaps contracts .
The payments amounted to letting Wall Street “ loot the corpse ” after the government had propped up AIG , said Edolphus Towns , the New York Democrat who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee .
PROTECTING TAXPAYERS
AIG ’s trading partners received 100 cents on the dollar to settle the swaps deals and lawmakers questioned why taxpayers did not get a better deal .
Geithner held steadfast to his defense that he had withdrawn from decisions by the New York Fed , which led the AIG bailout , after he was nominated to the Treasury post in late 2008 .
He forcefully defended his role in helping rescue the insurer .
“ For the first time since the Great Depression you were seeing a full - scale run on the financial system , ” Geithner said , his temper occasionally flaring .
He said he had “ no role in making decisions regarding what to disclose about specific financial terms ” of the AIG rescue in November 2008 , a bailout that eventually grew to cost more than $ 180 billion .
Neil Barofsky , special inspector general for the Treasury ’s $ 700 billion financial rescue fund , questioned whether the New York Fed and Treasury could have taken a harder line with bank counterparties , rather than paying them at par .
“ They could have just tried a little harder , ” he said .
“ It may have resulted in saving U.S. taxpayers billions , if not tens of billions of dollars .
We ’ll just never know . ”
GEITHNER SHOWS REMORSE BUT DEFENDS DECISIONS
Geithner ceded little ground during the 2 - 1/2 - hour grilling but did express some remorse at AIG - related decisions taken after he had recused himself .
“ In retrospect I wish I ’d known ” that AIG was keeping details quiet about the names and amounts of payments it was making to banks , he said .
Geithner insisted , however , that the decision to save AIG was “ the best of a terrible set of choices ” the government faced .
“ People were taking their savings out of the banks , they were wondering if a dollar was a dollar ...
There was a basic calamitous breakdown in the fabric of our system . ”
Henry Paulson , who was Treasury secretary when the initial decision to bail out AIG was taken , denied any knowledge of AIG ’s payments to banks , saying the Fed had authority to deal with counterparties .
He backed Geithner ’s position that an AIG rescue was necessary .
“ The decision to rescue AIG was correct and I strongly supported it , ” he said .
Several lawmakers protested that not enough effort was made to negotiate “ haircuts ” or discounts with bankers .
They said New York Fed officials had concurred with an AIG decision not to reveal the names of banks that got payments , or amounts .
Democratic staff members said they had found no evidence in hundreds of thousands of pages of documents subpoenaed by the committee to suggest Geithner was directly involved in decisions on the bank payments .
Rep. Dan Burton , an Indiana Republican , said , however , it " stretches credulity " to believe Geithner was not aware AIG was keeping quiet on details of its payments to banks .

Summary :
By keeping a history of the directories you 've visited , the Teleport command is an improvement on the Unix / Linux cd command .
By having a memory , Teleport lets you jump from one directory to any previously visited directory , easily .
January , 2015 Update : The Teleport command now supports Bash completion .
For more details on this , see the Github INSTALL .md file .
A few quick notes :
If you 're just looking for the Download link , it 's at the bottom of this article .
If you 'd like to see the Teleport command in action , I created this Teleport command video on YouTube :
The Teleport command
I 've named the command " teleport " , and it 's intended to be a replacement for the Unix / Linux cd command .
Really , it 's a wrapper around the cd command , first doing all of its own work related to keeping a history , and then issuing the appropriate Linux cd command .
The teleport command ( tp , for short ) does everything the Linux cd command does , with these improvements :
It keeps a history , remembering the directories you 've visited before .
It can display your history .
You can easily jump to any directory in your history .
And you can create aliases for your directories to make it even easier to jump to them .
Teleport command help
Once installed , you can get help on the teleport command by issuing the -h flag , like this :
tp -h
This displays a usage statement similar to the following :
Usage : tp [ DIR ]
Purpose : Provide the same capabilities as the ' cd ' command , but with a memory of directories that you have previously visited .
-h Show HELP ( this output ) -j PARTIAL - DIR JUMP to a directory found in your history ( by partial directory name ) -l LIST the history of visited directories -n [ NUM ]
Go to a directory by NUMBER .
NUM corresponds to the number printed by the -l option .
If NUM is not specified then a list of visited directories is shown and user can pick a number .
-s DIR SEARCH for and display a directory named DIR found in your history
Given that starter information , let 's see what the teleport command can do .
For basic use , tp is just like cd
For basic cases , you 'll use the tp command just like the cd command .
For instance , to move to your home directory , just type tp by itself , just like you would with the cd command :
tp
Or , if you prefer more typing , you can add the ~ character :
tp ~
Either one of those commands will take you to your home directory , just like cd .
To move back to your last directory , just add a - , again , just like cd :
tp -
To move to a local subdirectory named Pictures , again just replace the cd command with tp :
tp Pictures
To move to an absolute directory , like / tmp , again tp works just like cd :
tp /tmp
And to move up two directory levels , again , tp is the same :
tp ../..
Nothing too exciting yet ... so far it it works just like the Unix / Linux cd command .
Now let 's have some fun .
Basic teleporting
Where the tp command really shines is with its memory .
For instance , let 's say your current working directory is something like this :
/tmp/foo/bar/baz
Next , let 's assume you want to move to another directory somewhere else in the filesystem , like this one :
/home/al/ Pictures/2008/AlaskaTrip/Talkeetna
With the cd command , you 'd normally have to type something like this :
cd /home/al / Pictures/2008/AlaskaTrip/Talkeetna
But with the tp command , if you 've already been to the Talkeetna subdirectory , all you have to type is this :
tp Talkeetna
The teleport command instantly takes you to that directory .
In this case , that saves you over 30 characters of typing .
Here 's an image showing a few more examples of how easily the Teleport command lets you jump around :
This is one example of what remembering your working directory history can do for you , and is the primary reason for the name " teleport " .
Listing your teleport history
The next nice thing teleport does is provide a listing of your teleport history .
When you issue the teleport " list " command , like this :
tp -l
teleport will show you all the directories you 've visited recently , like this :
43 / Users/al / Projects/DD/Sketch 44 /Users/al/Desktop 45 /Users/al/Projects/DD/Imagen/release 46 /Users/al/Projects/DD/Hyde/build 47 /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/minime/sites/all/modules/minime 48 /Applications /MAMP/logs 49 /Users/al/ Projects/DD/Imagen/build 50 / Users/al/ Working/Cato-CRUD-Generator 51 / Applications / MAMP/htdocs/cato 52 /Users/al / Projects/DD/Imagen
53 / Applications/MAMP/htdocs/cato/templates
54 /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/sleetmute
I like this feature because ( a ) I work on a lot of different projects every week , and ( b ) I have a bad memory .
With the teleport command , it 's much easier to remember where all my project files are located .
Also , once you 've seen this history , you can teleport to any of those directories very easily .
For instance , no matter where I am currently in the filesystem , if I want to go to this directory :
/ Applications / MAMP/htdocs/minime/sites/all/modules/minime
all I have to type is this command :
tp minime
and I 'm instantly teleported to that directory .
I think you 'll agree that 's a really nice time - saver .
Teleport by number
The teleport command also includes an option to let you teleport to a directory by the number that is shown when you list the teleport history .
For instance , using the listing shown above , I can teleport to the same ' minime ' directory by typing this -n command :
tp -n 47
This is a nice feature for many purposes , especially when you have multiple directories that end with the same name .
New in Version 0.5 : Thanks to a nice contribution by John Santos ( somewhere in Portugal ) , the ' - n ' command has been significantly improved .
Now , instead of typing ' - l ' and then using those results to feed the ' - n ' command , if you now type the -n command without a number , like this :
tp -n
the Teleport command will automatically give you the -l history list , and prompt you for a selection , like this :
50 / Users/al / Working / Cato-CRUD-Generator 51 / Applications / MAMP/htdocs/cato 52 /Users/al / Projects/DD/Imagen
53 / Applications/MAMP/htdocs/cato/templates

If you 've used the Teleport command before , you know this is a sweet addition .
I suspect most people will now just use the -n option , and -l will mostly hang around for legacy purposes .
Bash completion with Teleport
Thanks to a nice addition by SneakyBobito , Teleport now supports Bash completion .
This is described in detail in the Github INSTALL .md file , but in short , if you have a directory named Twitter Client in your history and you begin to type this tp command at the Unix command prompt :
$ tp Twit
and then hit the [ Tab ] key , the new completion code will scan your Teleport history file , and if it finds any matches , it will automatically complete the directory name on the command line .
For instance , I have a directory named Twitter Client in my .tp_history file , so when I type this :
$ tp Twit [ Tab ]
my command is expanded to this :
$ tp TwitterClient
This is a terrific new addition to the Teleport command .
In addition to all of these features , you can also use teleport aliases .
Teleport aliases
Teleport aliases provide a simple way for you to create aliases to directories .
If you want to resolve conflicts between multiple directories with the same name ( as I just showed in the previous section ) , or you simply want to make sure teleport always knows about a certain directory , you can create an alias for that directory .
Currently the teleport alias works as a separate command named tpa .
( I 've thought about merging the tp and tpa commands into one command , but have not done so yet .
After using the commands for a while , I 'll be glad to hear your opinion on whether they should be merged together , or not . )
Here 's the usage statement for the teleport alias ( tpa ) command :
Usage : tpa ALIAS Purpose : Transport to a directory that has an alias ALIAS associated with it .
-a ALIAS DIR Add ALIAS as an alias / shortcut for the directory DIR -h Show HELP ( this output ) -l LIST the known directory aliases -r ALIAS Remove ALIAS from your list of known aliases
Adding / creating a teleport alias
To add a new teleport alias , use the - a option , and specify the alias first , followed by the actual directory name , like this :
tpa - a baz /tmp/bar/baz
After issuing that command you 'll see output similar to this :
Alias " baz " was added for the directory " / tmp / bar /baz " .
Using a teleport alias
Once you 've created an alias like that , no matter where you are on the filesystem , you can move to that directory using your alias with the tpa command , like this :
tpa baz
Listing your teleport aliases
To list your teleport aliases , just use the -l option of the tpa command , like this :
tpa -l
This will list all of the aliases you 've defined , like this :
perl :/ Users/al/ AlsLife/DD/Perl arrays :/ Users/al/AlsLife/DD/Perl/ArrayTests pub:/Users/al/AlsLife/DD/Perl/published
( I need to improve this format , but that 's the way it looks currently . )
Removing an alias
To remove a tpa alias , just use the -r option and the name of the alias , like this :
tpa -r pub
The tpa command responds like this :
About to remove alias " pub " -- are you sure ( y / [ n ] ) ? : _ Remove operation cancelled .
At this point ' n ' will cancel the remove operation , and 'y ' will proceed with the remove .
A tpgrep command
It ’s now May , 2020 , and I just added a tpgrep command to my personal installation .
( It ’s not in the download below . )
As its name implies , this command makes it easy to grep my ~/.tp_history file .
I currently have 192 directories in that file , so it ’s nice to have a command like this :
$ tpgrep html / Users/al / Projects/Books/ScalaBook/html /Users/al/Projects/Books/HelloScala/AmazonKindleVersion2/HtmlForAmazon /Users/al/Projects/Scala/AsciiDocToHtml /Users/al/Projects/Scala/FunctionalProgramming/FPBook/Pandoc/PdfOfBook/HtmlForAmazon /Users/al/Projects/Scala/FunctionalProgramming/FPBook/Pandoc/FPSimplified/HtmlForAmazon /Users/al/Projects/Scala/FunctionalProgramming/FPBook/Pandoc/AmazonKindle/BookAsHtml
As that output shows , the tpgrep command does a ` grep - i ` on the name you supply .
If you ’re interested in this shell script , here ’s its source code :
if [ $ # - eq 0 ] ; then echo " Please provide the file / directory name you want search for . " echo " USAGE : tpgrep foo " echo " That commands shows all match in the ~ /.tp_history file . " exit 1 fi grep - i $ 1 ~/.tp_history
I can make that fancier , but it works for today .
Summary
I hope you like the teleport command .
I think it makes some nice improvements to the standard Linux cd command .
The hardest part for me when I first started using it was remembering to type tp instead of cd .
Once I made it through that mental hurdle , I now hate to work on systems where I have n't installed the teleport command yet .
Download
You can download the teleport command as a tar 'd and gzip 'd file from the following link :
This file will extract to a directory named teleport , and that directory will contain the following files :
teleport / tp_command teleport / INSTALL teleport / LICENSE
Once you 've extracted the contents of this file , you can proceed with the installation .
See the INSTALL file for more information .

Documentary Film is a broad category of visual expression that is based on the attempt , in one fashion or another , to document reality .
Knowledge comes in different ways through our five senses .
Hearing , watching , touching , smelling and tasting are the only doorways to the outer world .
The wise men say that if something is not truly experienced with all our five senses , the experience will be partial , not total .
Therefore in a way almost all our gained knowledge through life is partial .
And maybe they are right .
If we follow that analogy , gaining knowledge through several senses simultaneously is better than through just one .
So , educating through watching educational videos , in this case documentaries , is really a total different experience than educating only on books .
Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not trying to undermine the books in any way .

( UPDATED BELOW )
Via Mark Crispin Miller , the Center for Constitutional Rights points to some venues for getting help to the people of Haiti : Partners in Health and the Haiti Emergency Relief Fund .
You can find several more in this listing from the New York Times .
I .
The relentlessly maintained , deliberately inflicted political and economic ruin of Haiti has a direct bearing on the amount of death and devastation that the country is suffering today after the earthquake .
It will also greatly cripple any recovery from this natural disaster .
As detailed below , Washington 's rapacious economic policies have destroyed all attempts to build a sustainable economy in Haiti , driving people off the land and from small communities into packed , dangerous , unhealthy shantytowns , to try to eke out a meager existence in the sweatshops owned by Western elites and their local cronies .
All attempts at changing a manifestly unjust society have been ruthlessly suppressed by the direct or collateral hand of Western elites .
The result ?
Millions of people -- weakened by hunger , deprivation , malnutrition , disease -- living jammed together in precarious , substandard housing .
A lack of the physical , financial and civic infrastructure needed to support a decent life in ordinary times -- and to provide proper assistance , and a strong framework for rebuilding , when disaster strikes .
Even a far lesser earthquake than the one that struck this week would have caused an unconscionable amount of unnecessary suffering in a nation that has been as ruthlessly and deliberately throttled as Haiti .
With Hurricane Katrina , we saw how callously and unjustly America 's elites reacted to the destruction of one of their own cities .
Politically connected Mississippi millionaires got prompt and copious assistance -- while many New Orleans natives are still refugees , scattered across the country years after the flood .
And this in a nation in which the infrastructures -- though rapidly rotting from the corruption of greed and militarism -- are still strong .
What hope then for Haiti ?
Yes , there will now be a great outpouring of immediate aid , as there always is after any spectacular disaster .
And of course , this is laudable , and I encourage anyone who can to contribute what they can to these efforts .
But unless there is a sea-change in American policy , unless there finally comes an end to the curse that has been laid on Haiti -- not by God , or by the Devil , but by the hard hearts of elites following blindly in the cruel traditions of their predecessors -- then this flurry of caring and attention will soon give way again , as it has always done , to callous disregard , brutal repression and inhumane exploitation .
The tale of these cruel traditions -- and the " continuity " with them that Obama has already displayed -- does not augur well for such a change .
But as that wise man , Edsel Floyd , always says , we live in hope and die in despair .
And such a hope for Haiti is worth holding onto , and working toward .
At the same time , hope must not be blind ; you have to acknowledge the grim realities in order to know just what you 're up against .
So let 's take a long , hard look .
II .
Scant hours after the earthquake hit , televangelist Pat Robertson was on the air , declaiming to his millions of viewers that the reason Haiti was stricken by this disaster -- and has been suffering grievously for 200 years -- is because the Haitians " swore a pact with the devil " in order to win their freedom from their French colonial overlords the early 1800s .
And while such vomitious expulsions are to be expected from this well - wadded , politically - wired , virulently extremist mullah ( once aptly described in these pages as a " dictator - coddler , blood diamond merchant , Jew - hater and milkshake shiller " ) this time there is a very tiny grain of truth to be found in the splattered mass of Robertson 's upchucking .
The Haitians have indeed been cursed for 200 years , and the curse does indeed go back to their liberation .
But pace Robertson , the source of this curse is not metaphysical .
As I noted in a piece written in 2004 :
Exactly two hundred years ago , Haitian slaves overthrew their French masters -- the first successful national slave revolt in history .
What Spartacus dreamed of doing , the Haitian slaves actually accomplished .
It was a tremendous achievement -- and the white West has never forgiven them for it .
In order to win international recognition for their new country , Haiti was forced to pay " reparations " to the slaveowners -- a crushing burden of debt they were still paying off at the end of the 19th century .
The United States , which refused to recognize the country for more than 60 years , invaded Haiti in 1915 , primarily to open it up to " foreign ownership of local concerns . "
After 19 years of occupation , the Americans backed a series of bloodthirsty dictatorships to protect these " foreign owners . "
And still it goes on .
Indeed it does .
The 2004 piece detailed Washington 's latest long , bipartisan squeeze play on Haiti , which culminated in a coup engineered by the Bush Administration -- the second time in which a U.S. president named George Bush had ousted the democratically - elected Haitian President Jean - Bertrand Aristide from office .
It is tale worth telling again :
Although the [ 2004 ]
Haiti coup was widely portrayed as an irresistible upsurge of popular discontent , it was of course the result of years of hard work by Bush 's dedicated corrupters of democracy , as William Bowles of Information Clearinghouse reports .
Bushist bagmen funded the political opposition to President Jean - Bertrand Aristide , smuggled guns to exiled Haitian warlords , and carried out a relentless strangulation of the county , cutting off long - promised financial and structural aid to one of the poorest nations on earth until food prices were soaring , unemployment spiked to 70 percent , and the broken - backed government lost control of society to armed gangs of criminals , fanatics and the merely desperate .
Meanwhile , Haiti was forced to pay $ 2 million a month on debts run up by the murderous ( U.S. - backed ) dictatorships that had ruled the island since the American military occupation of 1915 - 1934 .
...
The ostensible reason for Bush 's deadly squeeze play was Haiti 's disputed elections in 2000 .
That vote , only the nation 's third free election in 200 years , was indeed marred by reports of irregularities -- although these were not nearly as egregious as the well - documented hijinks which saw a certain runner - up candidate appointed to the White House that same year .
There was no question that Aristide and his party received an overwhelming majority of legitimate votes ; however , out of the 7,500 offices up for grabs , election observers did find that seven senate results seemed of dodgy provenance .
So what happened ?
The seven disputed senators resigned .
New elections for the seats were called , but the opposition - two elitist factions financed by Washington 's favorite engines of subversion , the Orwellian - monikered " National Endowment for Democracy " and " International Republican Institute " -- refused to take part .
The government broke down because the legislature could n't convene .
When Bush came in , he tightened the screws of the international blockade of the island , insisting that $ 500 million in desperately needed aid could not be released unless the opposition participated in new elections - while he was simultaneously paying the opposition not to participate .
The ultimate aim of this brutal pretzel logic was to grind Haiti 's destitute people further into the ground and destroy Aristide 's ability to govern .
His real crime , of course , was not the Florida - style election follies or the reported " tyranny . " ...
No , Aristide did something far worse than stuffing ballots or killing people -- he tried to raise the minimum wage , to the princely sum of two dollars a day .
This move outraged the American corporations -- and their local lackeys -- who have for generations used Haiti as a pool of dirt - cheap labor and sky - high profits .
It was the last straw for the elitist factions , one of which is actually led by an American citizen and former Reagan - Bush appointee , manufacturing tycoon Andy Apaid .
Apaid was the point man for the rapacious Reagan - Bush " market reform " drive in Haiti .
Of course , " reform , " in the degraded jargon of the privateers , means exposing even the very means of survival and sustenance to the ravages of powerful corporate interests .
For example , the Reagan - Bush plan forced Haiti to lift import tariffs on rice , which had long been a locally - grown staple .
Then they flooded Haiti with heavily subsidized American rice , destroying the local market and throwing thousands of self - sufficient farmers out of work .
With a now - captive market , the American companies jacked up their prices , spreading ruin and hunger throughout Haitian society .
The jobless farmers provided new fodder for the factories of Apaid and his cronies .
Reagan and Bush chipped in by abolishing taxes for American corporations who set up Haitian sweatshops .
The result was a precipitous drop in wages - and life expectancy .
Aristide 's first election in 1990 threatened these cozy arrangements , so he was duly ejected by a military coup , with Bush I 's not - so - tacit connivance .
But as we said , the latest round of punishment for Haiti was a thoroughly bipartisan affair :
Bill Clinton restored Aristide to office in 1994 - but only after forcing him to agree to , yes , " market reforms . "
In fact , it was Clinton , the privateers ' pal , who instigated the post-election aid embargo that Bush II used to such devastating effect .
Aristide 's chief failing as a leader was his attempt to live up to this bipartisan blackmail .
As in every other nation that 's come under the IMF whip , Haiti 's already - fragile economy collapsed .
Bush family retainers like Apaid then shoved the country into total chaos , making it easy prey for the warlords whom Bush operatives - many of them old Iran - Contra hands - supplied with arms through the Dominican Republic , the Boston Globe reports .
...
When Aristide agreed to a deal , brokered by his fellow leaders in the Caribbean , that would have effectively ceded power to the Bush - funded opposition but at least preserved the lineaments of Haitian democracy - Apaid and the boys turned down the offer , with the blessing of their paymasters in Washington , who suddenly claimed they had no influence over their recalcitrant hired hands .
...
Instead , Aristide was told by armed American gunmen that if he did n't resign , he would be left to die at the hands of the rebels .
Then he was bundled onto a waiting plane and dumped in the middle of Africa .
Within hours , the Bush - backed terrorists were marching openly through Port - au - Prince , executing Aristide 's supporters .
Guess they wo n't be asking for two dollars a day now , eh? Mission accomplished !
III .
Of course , all of that happened in the bad old days , before Barack Obama ushered us into a new , " post - racial " era .
Surely this man of vision and compassion , himself a scion of Africa , would at last put an end to Haiti 's punishment for rising up against its white masters .
But it was not to be .
As noted here last year , in " Cry , the Unforgiven Country " :
Obama and his " superstar " secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , are loudly championing the latest egregious , brutal farce that Washington and the West have foisted upon the uppity natives of Haiti .
Senatorial elections held this month by the government imposed on Haiti after the U.S. - backed coup of 2004 ... produced a turnout of less than 10 percent of eligible voters : a result that mocks any notion of a popular , legitimate democracy .
But this is not because the Haitians are so lazy and disinterested that they could n't be bothered to vote .
Nor that they are so satisfied with the benevolent , paternal care of their American - appointed masters that they saw no need to let silly electoral contests trouble their bucolic life .
No , the 90 percent refusal rate was in fact a massive protest action , driven chiefly by the fact that the American - backed government would not allow the most popular party -- the party of the government ousted by the 2004 coup -- to run a slate of candidates in the election .
By clerkly hook and bureaucratic crook , Haiti 's election overseers banned the Fanmi Lavalas slate back in February .
At that moment , the April elections became a dead letter , a meaningless farce -- yet another cruel joke played on the people of Haiti .
How did the enlightened progressives of the new American administration respond ?
John Caruso reports :
CLINTON : The U.S. removed a military dictatorship in 1995 , clearing the way for democracy .
And after several years of political disputes , common in any country making a transition , Haiti began to see progress .
And the national and presidential elections in 2006 really moved Haiti ’s democracy forward .
What the president and the prime minister are seeking is to maintain a strong commitment to democratic governance which will take another step forward with elections for the senate on Sunday .
To translate from the vulgar Clintonian dialect : 1 ) " political disputes " refers to the overwhelmingly popular presidency of Jean - Bertrand Aristide , which was " disputed " ( and continually undermined ) by the U.S. and its fifth column in Haiti ; 2 ) Haiti " began to see progress " thanks to the U.S. - backed coup of Aristide in 2004 ; and 3 ) the 2006 elections that " really moved Haiti's democracy forward " excluded both Aristide and FL's preferred candidate in his stead ( Father Gerard Jean - Juste , thrown in prison on invented charges by the U.S. - backed government in order to prevent him from running ) , resulting in the ascension of Rene Preval — who understands clearly who 's the boss , and therefore merits a pat on the head from Clinton .
Which brings us to today 's senatorial elections , in which the U.S. / Haitian " strong commitment to democratic governance ... will take another step forward " via the calculated suppression of the majority party 's ability to run a slate of candidates ...
So the centuries - long U.S. project of democracy prevention in Haiti is still going swimmingly .
And anyone who feared that our first black president might be less sympathetic to the need to smash the democratic aspirations of the first free black nation in the hemisphere can rest assured : Obama will never let race — or anything else — stop him from doing the empire 's dirty work .
It is certain such dirty work will soon be afoot once more -- and we must fight it , call attention to it , and not let Haiti disappear in the imperial shadow yet again .
But at this moment , the most pressing concern is the human suffering in Haiti .
So again , do look into the relief efforts noted above , or any others you might prefer .
Bernard Avishai describes Ben Caspit , an Israeli TV host , as a populist journo and then quotes these statements from him the other night :
Caspit wanted to talk about the public statement Friday by Likud ’s Limor Livnat , a formidable minister in Netanyahu ’s coaliton , that the freeze only proves Obama is anti-Israel , that " we have fallen into the hands of a terrible administration . " … " [ I ] n essence , " Caspit said , " she [ Livnat ] said courageously what most of us think .
The Americans –this administration–and I do n’t fear them because I am not , lucky for all of us , a minister –is really an administration that burdens us , that is awful and terrible for Israel . " … Later … Caspit said : " What , and soon we ’ll have to freeze in Jerusalem ?
This is unprecedented . "
[ Guest ]
Gideon Ezra protested that , for example , starting a new settlement in Nof Zion – " which is really Jabel Mukaber " –is an absurd provocation ; that the key is to strengthen moderate forces among the Palestinians .
Caspit ’s answer in the form of a question : " So we will have given up 10 months of settlement for nothing , just so the goyim will say we are okay . " ..
Avishai says that Obama should " refocus the conversation not only on what Israelis should stop doing , but on positive steps that make concrete what positive steps the world community –goyim–expect Israelis and Palestinians to take . "
Avishai ’s steps are not particularly convincing to me .
It all seems way too little too late .
Why , just consider the stunning arrogance of Caspit ’s statement .
This is the stuff of Greek mythology .
This man sees no reason on human terms to end the colonization process and attempt to dismantle apartheid– he has no sense of anything owed an occupied people .
No , it is just to get rid of the pressure from the goyim .
It reveals to me the psychic damage of the blank check the Israel lobby has granted Israel for decades , and the damage of putrid ethnocentrism , a hubris born of the Leon Uris statement in Exodus that Jews can only rely on themselves .

On his radio show today Rush Limbaugh blamed the Ft. Hood shooting where 13 soldiers were killed on President Obama .
Limbaugh said , “ We could almost say this is Obama ’s fault , because this guy said that he believed Obama was going to get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan . ”
Here is the audio :
Limbaugh said , “ I am sure they ’re not going to call this hate crime .
I ’m sure this man ’s inner feelings are going to be probed regarding the Bush / Cheney war .
You wait , but let ’s not forget this man had no problem with killing people , zilch .
This guy ’s not a pacifist .
This guy is not a coconscious objector .
He did n’t like Americans in Afghanistan or Iraq , and by the way , playing the game the way the media and the Democrats do , we can almost say that this is Obama ’s fault , because this guy said that he believed that Obama was going to get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Obama has n’t done it , and that ’s one of the reasons why the guy cracked . ”

According to Rush , it is Obama ’s fault that a mentally unstable man shot 43 people last week .
It is pretty safe to say that his upcoming deployment was not the only reason why this man decided to go on a shooting .
However , Limbaugh ’s Obama paranoia knows no boundaries .
It is only a matter of time before Limbaugh starts blaming Obama for the weather .
Limbaugh ’s act would be funny , if it was n’t so sad that millions of people listen to this guy .
The whole idea that everything bad that happens in the world is Obama ’s fault is getting tedious .
The Ft. Hood shooting is no more Obama ’s fault , then the Virginia Tech shooting was Bush ’s fault .
It may be difficult for Limbaugh to understand this , but not all people act with a political motive in mind .
Once again , Rush tries to capitalize on a tragedy by blaming Obama .
The Many Ants of Iceland
I ’m standing in a huge room that looks more like a wedding reception hall than a national summit chamber , with a stage , a buffet table , and 1,500 Icelanders sitting at round tables talking excitedly .
We ’ve been serenaded by a girls choir and fed lamb soup .
Attendees refer to themselves as " ants , " and our name tags only feature our first names .
Surreal as the event may seem , many Icelanders are convinced it ’s the only way to get their troubled economy back on track .
In this tiny , sheltered island nation , as political crises mount , solutions to economic distress are coming from some unexpected directions .
About a year ago , days after the collapse of Iceland ’s three largest banks bankrupted the country , Icelanders held a peaceful protest calling for the removal of the then chairman of the board of governors of Iceland ’s central bank , David Oddsson .
By early 2009 , as general protests increased in size and sometimes turned violent , the country ’s government was ousted .
The political situation has now stabilized , but Icelanders remain skeptical about the current government and the economy has n’t rebounded .
Unemployment tops 8 percent , an alarmingly high figure in a country of 300,000 citizens where the rate prior to the crash hovered around 1 percent .
Meanwhile , the country is struggling to pay back the debt it incurred during last year ’s bank failures .
On Dec. 30 , Iceland ’s parliament narrowly approved a bill to reimburse Britain and the Netherlands more than $ 5 billion for the losses those countries ’ investors took during Iceland ’s crash .
But the bill is hugely unpopular because of the burden it places on taxpayers , who resent having to pay for the mistakes of private financial firms supervised by other country ’s regulators .
President Olafur Grimsson vetoed it on Jan. 5 , throwing the government into turmoil once again .
Grimsson has argued that the bill should be subject to a national referendum , but supporters of the legislation fear that if the bill fails , it would endanger the $ 10 billion IMF aid package promised to Iceland after the bank failures , as well as Iceland ’s chances of joining the European Union .
In reaction to these crises , a sort of grassroots economics movement has risen up in Reykjavik , where citizens are trying to provide solutions for and by the people .
One of the organizations leading the pack is House of Ideas , a loosely defined office - space - cum - think - tank that is the brainchild of Gudjon Gudjonsson , a telecom industry entrepreneur and professor of entrepreneurship at Reykjavik University .
Shortly after the crash , House of Ideas , under the sponsorship of Reykjavik University and the Iceland Academy of the Arts , began providing creative entrepreneurs rent - free space to foster business ideas .
No walls separate companies , and most work in a central room with an indoor park containing a tire swing and life - size male doll , which slumps on a bench , apparently to reinforce the park setting .
There ’s a room filled with randomly scattered , mismatched couches and a coffee shop with a ping - pong table .
Words from brainstorming sessions adorn the walls .
One company uses brain waves to play a game ; another is inventing a more advanced kind of television set .
The " National Assembly , " where I found myself eating lamb soup and listening to the children ’s choir , came out of the intellectual crucible of the Ministry of Ideas , which is located in the House of Ideas .
This experiment in collective decision - making brought together 1,500 Icelanders , the majority of whom were selected randomly from Iceland ’s National Registry , to brainstorm ways to rebuild the country ’s economy and its values .
In any other country this might be fairly considered completely insane ; in Iceland , where the participants made up a respectable 0.5 percent of the country ’s population , there was a certain logic to it .
In July , a group of volunteers based out of the House of Ideas joined forces with other grassroots organizations to begin developing the National Assembly ’s manifesto .
Gudjonsson explains his initiative as an attempt to develop a business plan for Iceland .
" The country could behave like a business in terms of sharing common values and a common vision , " he said .
" Iceland ’s population is the size of General Electric .
The opportunity Iceland has is to model a new way of democracy . "
He wants Icelanders to become part of the solution , rather than passively remaining at the mercy of the financial institutions that destroyed the country ’s economy .
Gudjonsson sent me the National Assembly ’s manifesto , which designates the assembly ’s volunteers as " The Anthill " and describes its mission as pursuing a " unique flavor of crowd - sourced democracy . "
The National Assembly ’s goal , the manifesto states , is to " harness the collective wisdom and consciousness of the Icelandic public , which is hidden to each individual in isolation . "
One of the founding National Assembly " ants " told me that the " Anthill " moniker was inspired by ants ’ intuitive perception of threats and their ability to move their society to safety ; each ant is an equally important part of the whole .
Original " ants " in the National Assembly Anthill include Iceland ’s minister of environment and the singer Björk , who helped formulate the idea of the National Assembly but did not , unfortunately , attend .
The ants finally came together on Nov. 14 , when 1,200 random Icelanders and 300 influential Icelandic leaders , including former and current political figures , gathered at Reykjavik ’s sporting arena , Laugardalsholl .
Laugardalsholl ’s main hall was decked out with video screens and balloons everywhere .
Volunteer ant Sigga Stina , media ant Marianna , and data logistics ant Thorgics brief me , as the participants start to gather at their tables :
Seven discussion rounds enable participants to confer on categories vital to national health .
Individuals write down words through each round , and each table reaches a consensus on one phrase during every round .
The data for the entire assembly will then be tabulated and appear both on a website , which is broadcasting live video of the proceedings , and as word clouds shared on the video screens at the National Assembly in real time .
The most popular responses appear as the largest words within the cloud .
By 10 a.m. , 1,500 Icelanders — young and old , male and female — are sitting at their assigned tables .
The mayor of Reykjavik , Hanna Birna Kristjansdottir , sits at one table , the leader of the fallen Independence Party , Bjarni Benediktsson Jr. , at another .
Finance Minister Steingrimur J. Sigfusson also participates .
They are working with common Icelanders , from a pink - haired 18 - year - old to a 100 - year - old fisherman .
During rounds , the room is subdued as people focus on the discussions .
" This is hard work , but important work , " says one ant during a break between rounds .
By lunchtime the first word cloud forms on the video screens : Heidarleiki , or honesty and integrity , is number one .
The room erupts in applause .
Equal rights , respect , and justice are tied for second .
Love , responsibility , freedom , sustainability , democracy , family , equality , and trust follow .
Words such as " transparency " and " education " are also popular .
Between rounds , there are meals and entertainment .
Marianna wipes away tears .
" This is the future of Iceland , " announces a facilitator ant .
At the end of the day , participants fill out suggestion cards on ways to improve Iceland ’s future , as an Icelandic singer performs in the background .
They then stuff the cards into boxes by the stage .
We eat our soup .
Smiles abound .

He wants a variety of jobs available for everyone and programs to teach young people how to form a better society .
During the next phase , laid out by the National Assembly ’s manifesto , the Anthill will implement an action plan for the year ahead .
Ten days later , Iceland Review , an English - language magazine in Reykjavik , and the Icelandic daily Morgunbladid reported the formation of a partnership between the Anthill and a government - appointed strategic - planning task force to " incorporate the conclusions of the National Assembly into the task force ’s plans . "
The results of the National Assembly — simple words that define a nation ’s values and economic needs — may seem like rhetoric , and after the corruption and collusion within the government and its former banks , it ’s no surprise that words such as " honesty " and " integrity " would receive consensus among Icelanders .
Still , no matter the outcome of these developments , Iceland ’s ants have responded to the daunting challenges they face by starting to form a solution that can truly bear the stamp : " Made in Iceland . "
Washington ( CNN ) -- NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has reached back 13.2 billion years -- farther than ever before in time and space -- to reveal a " primordial population " of galaxies never seen before .
" The deeper Hubble looks into space , the farther back in time it looks , because light takes billions of years to cross the observable universe , " the Space Telescope Science Institute said in a statement released Tuesday .
" This makes Hubble a powerful ' time machine ' that allows astronomers to see galaxies as they were 13 billion years ago -- just 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang , " the institute said in a statement released Tuesday .
The existence of these newly found galaxies pushes back the time when galaxies began to form to before 500 - 600 million years after the Big Bang , the institute said .
" These galaxies could have roots stretching into an earlier population of stars .
There must be a substantial component of galaxies beyond Hubble 's detection limit , " according to James Dunlop of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland , who was quoted in the release .
Members of the American Astronomical Society are meeting this week in Washington to review the data and images retrieved by Hubble 's new infrared Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) , which was installed in May , institute spokesman Ray Villard told CNN .
Some of the images were shared with the public in September .
The camera , Villard said , is far superior to the previous camera , which could only see galaxies about 900 million years after the Big Bang -- the cosmic explosion that is theorized to mark the origin of the universe .
But it is reaching its limits , he said .
A more powerful instrument , the James Webb Space Telescope , is planned for launch in 2014 .
It will allow astronomers to study the detailed nature of early galaxies and discover many more even farther away .
From the current cache of images , astronomers can see for the first time that " galaxies grew from small , bright clusters of stars to the big spiral cities of stars today , " Villard said .
The small galaxies show up as ultra - blue in color .
He likened the Hubble results to " looking through a scrapbook of baby pictures . "
According to the institute , " the deep observations also demonstrate the progressive buildup of galaxies and provide further support for the hierarchical model of galaxy assembly , where small objects ... merge to form bigger objects over a smooth and steady but dramatic process of collision and agglomeration .
It 's like streams merging into tributaries and then into a bay . "
The camera was pointed at a section of sky known as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field , which was initially surveyed in visible light in 2004 , and showed a dark sky filled with more than 10,000 galaxies .
The WFC3 instrument repeated the exercise in August for infrared light .
Some mosaics were formed with the images from both surveys .
According to Villard , the archive from Hubble contains more than 500,000 pictures that can be accessed by the world 's 6,000 astronomers .
The data from the Ultra Deep Field have been analyzed by at least five international teams of astronomers , he said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States does not plan to send U.S. troops into Yemen or Somalia as those countries struggle to contain Islamic militants , President Barack Obama said in remarks published on Sunday .

“ I have no intention of sending U.S. boots on the ground in these regions , ” Obama told People magazine , referring to Yemen and Somalia .
“ I have every intention of working with our international partners in lawless areas around the globe to make sure that we ’re keeping the American people safe , ” Obama added , according to a transcript provided by the magazine .
Obama has said Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , based in Yemen , appears to have trained , equipped and directed the Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up a U.S. airliner bound for Detroit on December 25 , using explosives sewn into his underwear .
Al Shabaab , an al Qaeda - inspired insurgency , has seized large areas of south and central Somalia , the Horn of Africa nation situated across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen , which is located at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula .
“ We ’ve known throughout this year that al Qaeda in Yemen has become a more serious problem .
And , as a consequence , we have partnered with the Yemeni government to go after those terrorist training camps and cells there in a much more deliberate and sustained fashion , ” Obama said .
“ The same is true in Somalia , another country where there are large chunks that are not fully under government control and al Qaeda is trying to take advantage of them , ” he added .
The United States already has large contingents of ground forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
U.S. officials have said they are looking at ways to expand military and intelligence cooperation with Yemen , the poorest Arab state , to root out al Qaeda leadership in the country .
Islamic militants bombed the USS Cole warship in the Yemeni port of Aden in 2000 , killing 17 U.S. sailors .
General David Petraeus , who as head of U.S. Central Command oversees an area stretching from the Horn of Africa to Central Asia , met Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on January 2 in Sanaa .
Their talks focused on strengthening security , military and economic cooperation .
‘A GOOD RESPONSE ’
“ Yemen does not want to have American ground troops there .
And that ’s a good response for us to hear , certainly , ” Petraeus said in an interview aired on Sunday on CNN .
“ Of course , we would always want a host nation to deal with a problem itself .
We want to help .
We ’re providing assistance , ” Petraeus added .
The United States intends to increase its security assistance funding to Yemen from $ 70 million last year to at least $ 150 million this year , Petraeus told CNN .
The United States has increased training , intelligence and military equipment provided to Yemeni forces , helping them to stage raids against suspected al Qaeda hide - outs .
While an international anti-piracy flotilla patrols the Gulf of Aden , hundreds of small boats carrying contraband shuttle undetected between Yemen and Somalia every week .
Somalia ’s pirates continue to roam the seas and seize vessels for ransom .
Security experts also say Yemenis make up a sizable part of a foreign contingent that fights with al Shabaab ’s Somali rank and file and supplies bomb - making and communications expertise .
THE cost of convenience fluctuates wildly across Sydney - the price of bread and milk commonly varying by more than 30 per cent .
A survey by The Daily Telegraph has found that depending on which corner you walk to , customers can pay anywhere from $ 3.20 to $ 5.25 for identical 2L bottles of milk .
And anyone so desperate for a dairy fix that they buy it at Sydney Airport will be up for $ 6.95 - 117 per cent more than at Renown Minimart , Casula , and 85 per cent higher than the price at Andrews Corner Store , St Marys , which both charge less than the big supermarkets .
" We always try to undercut the supermarket .
You lose on some items to get the patronage , " Andrews Corner Store co-owner Harry Papazoglou said .
At Quix Penrith , which charges $ 5.25 for two litres , manager Chris Malone said : " I have nothing to do with the price .
Head office tell us what price to put up and that 's what we do . "
One possible explanation for the significant discrepancies between prices is that owners know customers will pay , whatever the cost .
A submission to the 2008 ACCC Grocery Prices Inquiry by the Motor Trades Association of Queensland , whose members operate convenience stores at their service stations , said items purchased " may be categorised as discretionary expenditure which is either impulse buying or convenience buying .
" The products bought are not price sensitive but price in elastic " .
In other words , raising the price does not have an effect on the volume of sales .
MTA
Qld also said that margins on convenience store items were typically 27 - 30 per cent .
Business analysts IbisWorld estimated convenience stores turned over a combined $ 6.4 billion in 2008 - more than $ 300 for every Australian .
Revenue was growing at 4.4 per cent a year .
Cigarettes account for about a third of all sales , drinks another 15 per cent .
Milk represented less than 7 per cent of turnover and bread 1.4 per cent .
This may explain why some stores are willing to cut the price on these items - they represent only a small slice of sales .

I suppose you could chalk up to rage the total lack of coherence or structure in Michael Moore 's " open letter " to President Obama on sending 34,000 more troops * to Afghanistan .
Getting through the letter is difficult enough , so I 'll comment only on the part I find most interesting : the opening paragraph ( convenient , eh ? ) , which contains the lefty meme that the president 's perceived rightward shift on certain policy matters represents some kind of personal betrayal to liberals :
Do you really want to be the new " war president " ?
If you go to West Point tomorrow night ( Tuesday , 8 p.m. ) and announce that you are increasing , rather than withdrawing , the troops in Afghanistan , you are the new war president .
Pure and simple .
And with that you will do the worst possible thing you could do -- destroy the hopes and dreams so many millions have placed in you .
With just one speech tomorrow night you will turn a multitude of young people who were the backbone of your campaign into disillusioned cynics .
In other words :
Not only is this decision bad for the country , but you 've betrayed us , Mr. President , the very people whose work and votes won you your job .
Two things :
First , this is a particularly personal ( and , in my view , lame ) form of umbrage - taking that assumes the election of a Democratic president in a polarized two - party contest represents some kind of validation of a host of liberal positions .
This line of thinking is n't confined to war .
In a Times Op - Ed article last August , Anne Lammott expressed a similar form of disillusion over the president 's perceived lack of progress on healthcare reform .
Second , I 'd sympathize with Moore and liberals who express similar disappointment if there were something about Obama 's decision to actually feel betrayed over -- but there is n't .
Recall that the buzz surrounding Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal 's call in August for more troops was whether the president would fall in line with his campaign rhetoric by sending more Americans to Afghanistan .
Even Obama 's most ardent supporters should have understood the president would be faced with such an ugly decision if the war in Afghanistan were to take a turn for the worse .
It did , and the president 's decision should n't be terribly surprising .
Anyhow , what are your thoughts on sending more troops to Afghanistan ?
Take our unscientific poll , leave a comment or do both .
-- Paul Thornton
* UPDATE ( 9:25 a.m. , Tuesday ) : Today 's reports put the number of additional troops to be sent to Afghanistan at 30,000 .

Reader Walter passed along this distressing sighting from Chris Floyd 's blog .
American civil liberties were gutted last week , and the media failed to report it .
Anyone who is arbitrarily declared a " suspected enemy combatant " by the president or his designated minions is no longer a " person . "
The development ?
If the president or one of his subordinates declares someone to be an " enemy combatant " ( the 21st century version of " enemy of the state " ) he is denied any protection of the law .
So any trouble - maker ( which means anyone ) can be whisked away , incarcerated , tortured , " disappeared , " you name it .
Floyd 's commentary : ( http://chris-floyd.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/1887- dred-scott-redux-obama-and-the-supremes-stand-up-for-slavery.html)
After hearing passionate arguments from the Obama Administration , the Supreme Court acquiesced to the president 's fervent request and , in a one - line ruling , let stand a lower court decision that declared torture an ordinary , expected consequence of military detention , while introducing a shocking new precedent for all future courts to follow : anyone who is arbitrarily declared a " suspected enemy combatant " by the president or his designated minions is no longer a " person . "
They will simply cease to exist as a legal entity .
They will have no inherent rights , no human rights , no legal standing whatsoever - save whatever modicum of process the government arbitrarily deigns to grant them from time to time , with its ever - shifting tribunals and show trials .
It is hard to overstate the significance of this horrid decision .
The fact that the Supreme Court authorized this land grab says we no longer have an independent judiciary , that the Supreme Court itself is gutting the protections supposedly provided by the legal system .
Per Floyd :
In fact , our most august defenders of the Constitution did not have to exert themselves in the slightest to eviscerate not merely 220 years of Constitutional jurisprudence but also centuries of agonizing effort to lift civilization a few inches out of the blood - soaked mire that is our common human legacy .
They just had to write a single sentence .
Now Floyd saw this mainly as an issue of the treatment of enemy combatants and Obama hypocrisy about torture , which is bad enough :
The Constitution is clear : no person can be held without due process ; no person can be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment .
And the U.S. law on torture of any kind is crystal clear : it is forbidden , categorically , even in time of " national emergency . "
And the instigation of torture is , under U.S. law , a capital crime .
No person can be tortured , at any time , for any reason , and there are no immunities whatsoever for torture offered anywhere in the law .
And yet this is what Barack Obama - who , we are told incessantly , is a super - brilliant Constitutional lawyer - has been arguing in case after case since becoming president :
Torturers are immune from prosecution ; those who ordered torture are immune from prosecution .
let 's be absolutely clear : Barack Obama has taken the freely chosen , public , formal stand - in court - that there is nothing wrong with any of these activities .
Yves here .
The implications are FAR worse .
Anyone can be stripped , with NO RECOURSE , of all their legal rights on a Presidential say so .
Readers in the US no longer have any security under the law .
Roman citizens enjoyed a right to a trial , a right of appeal , and could not be tortured , whipped , or executed except if found guilty of treason , and anyone charged with treason could demand a trial in Rome .
We have regressed more than 2000 years with this appalling ruling .

The Dow is down over a hundred points today and it 's making professional traders nervous .
We spoke to a friend this morning at a large prop trading desk inside an investment bank and we ’ve never heard him so bleak .
He says that all the equity traders on his desk think the market will do nothing but go down for the rest of the year .
“ We ’re all waiting for the market to crack .
And it looks today like it has cracked .
We ’ve had all this upward momentum with no volume .
But now that thin buying up has gone .
The only question in my mind is whether it ’s a slowly deflating balloon or whether we ’ll go into freefall , ” he said .
Make of that what you will .
Maybe it ’s a contrarian indicator .
After all , very few of these prop trading types believed in the rally going all the way back to March .
Maybe the Wall Street traders are now contrarian indicators .
Budding private sector suspended as savers rush to change money after Pyongyang redenominates the won to curb inflation
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
North Korea 's surprise decision to redenominate its currency has prompted panic and despair among merchants left with piles of worthless notes , even driving one couple to suicide , activists said today .
North Korea informed citizens and foreign embassies on Monday that it would redenominate its national currency , the won , diplomats said .
Residents in the reclusive communist state were told they have until Sunday to exchange a limited amount of old bills , they said .
The news sent Pyongyang residents rushing to the black market to convert hoarded bills into US dollars and Chinese yuan , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported , citing unidentified North Korean traders operating in neighbouring China .
Shops , bathhouses , barber shops and restaurants have closed , activists said .
" We heard business and market activities were all suspended , " said Lee Seung - yong , an official at Good Friends , a Seoul - based civic group that sends food and other aid to North Korea .
" People have no money to engage in business . "
Authorities have threatened " merciless punishment " for anyone violating currency exchange rules , Good Friends said .
The overhaul of the North Korean won – the most drastic in 50 years – aims to curb runaway inflation and clamp down on the street markets that have sprung up in the tightly controlled nation , analysts said .
Unable to feed its 24 million people , the regime began allowing some markets in 2002 , including farmers ' markets .
The markets may have encouraged trade but they also brought in banned goods such as films and soap operas from South Korea , threatening leader Kim Jong - il 's totalitarian rule , analysts said .
The country 's largest wholesale market , in Pyongyang , reportedly closed in June .
With the currency overhaul , the government is retaking control of the economy from merchants , analysts said .
" This is aimed at rooting out the budding private sector , " said Jeong Kwang - min , a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul , adding that the move has a broader goal : to pave the way for Kim Jong - il to hand power to his youngest son , Kim Jong -un , and to ensure he inherits a stable economy .
Kim , 67 , has led North Korea since 1994 but he is said to have suffered a stroke in August 2008 .
The country has endured economic turmoil since the collapse of the Soviet Union and flooding and economic mismanagement in the mid-1990s .
North Korea since has relied on international food handouts and aid negotiated in exchange for promises to dismantle its nuclear programme .
Much of that aid has been suspended , and international sanctions tightened , because of Pyongyang 's nuclear defiance .
The currency overhaul comes just days before President Barack Obama 's envoy on North Korea visits Pyongyang to try to persuade the regime to return to nuclear disarmament talks .
North Korea announced on state radio that the exchange rate would be set at 100 old won to 1 new won , one foreign diplomat said .
Residents will only be allowed to exchange 150,000 won for the new currency , according to South Korea 's Joong Ang Ilbo newspaper and other media outlets monitoring North Korean radio .
Cash in excess of the allowed amount must be saved in government - run banks , but it was not clear if residents could change that money into new bills , according to South Korean media .
A stampede in Hoeryong , in the north - east , nearly forced the suspension of trains , with guards blocking the entrance to a bank in the city , the Seoul - based Network for North Korean Democracy and Human Rights said , citing unidentified sources .
In North Hamgyong province , a merchant couple in their 60s killed themselves after hearing of the revaluation , said the Daily NK , a Seoul - based online news outlet that focuses on North Korean affairs .
Yoo Ho-yeol , a North Korea expert at Seoul 's Korea University , said he did not expect any further drastic measures .
He said : " Other kinds of private economic enterprise will eventually spring up again . "
Preamble
I 'm not a nutter , nor am I trying to get out of paying " my fair share . "
I recognize that the laws of society cost money to enforce and that there are a few natural monopolies that tend to be better served by the public sector .
I am not against taxes morally , though I am against some uses of the taxes .
I dislike taxes on labor and trade for pragmatic reasons , they put a governor on the engine of satisfaction of desires : they are a tax on good behavior .
There are many attacks on the federal income tax and , with the byantine nature of the code , who knows how many are valid .
If we have a nation of laws and not of men , it should only matter what the letter of the law says - I expect all assertions made by the IRS and those fighting it be logical and cogent .
I dismiss out of hand any appeals to fear , authority , " we need the money , " " this would cause chaos , " or " I do n't want to pay . "
That said , my understanding is that INCOME itself is not defined in the regulation .
As a Georgist , my understanding is that , after the LVT movement was subverted in the early 1900's , Henry George Jr. , and others worked toward an income tax that would try to recover money from privilege via a top down approach - closer to a capital gains tax than a labor tax .
The Laws
16th Amendment
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived , without apportionment among the several States , and without regard to any census or enumeration .
I take this to be an enabling clause , removing the restrictions imposed by Article 1 , Section 9 .
This does n't create an income tax , it just allows it .
26 U.S.C. § 1
There is hereby imposed on the taxable income of [ various categories , such as married individuals , single individuals , etc. , omitted for sake of this discussion ] a tax determined in accordance with the following table : [ table omitted for brevity ] .
Ok , so there is a tax on taxable income ... aka an income tax .
So what 's taxable income ?
Section 63 .
Taxable Income Defined
[ T ]he term " taxable income " means gross income minus the deductions allowed by this chapter ( other than the standard deduction ) .
Ok , so taxable income is gross income minus deductions .
What 's gross income ?
Section 61 .
Gross Income Defined
Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle , gross income means all income from whatever source derived , including ( but not limited to ) the following items :
Compensation for services , including fees , commissions , fringe benefits , and similar items ;
Gross income derived from business ; Gains derived from dealings in property ; Interest ; Rents ; Royalties ; Dividends ;
Alimony and separate maintenance payments ;
Annuities ;
Income from life insurance and endowment contracts ; Pensions ;
Income from discharge of indebtedness ; Distributive share of partnership gross income ; Income in respect of a decedent ; and Income from an interest in an estate or trust .
Ok , now we run into a problem .
Gross income means income from any source .
So what does income mean ?
Crickets ...
What 's Income Then ?
Barring a definition , the dictionary definition must be used ...
a coming in : entrance , influx a gain or recurrent benefit usually measured in money that derives from capital or labor
So , income is a gain .
Thought experiment .
You break a $ 20 for 4 $ 5's .
How much income did you make ?
Not $ 20 , or anywhere close to it .
Would you let someone break your $ 20 for a 5 cent fee ?
Possibly .
For a $ 1 fee ?
Less likely .
For $ 10 ?
No way .
So , even though it could be argued that you 're gaining from trade , you 're not gaining $ 20 worth .
Let 's look at wages .
You work a year for $ 70 k .
Did you gain $ 70 k ?
No , you traded part of your life for that money .
While it can be argued that some of that money is a gain ( otherwise why did you do the transaction ) , the entire sum is certainly not .
Would you work a year for $ 1 ?
No .
Then that one dollar is not a gain ... it 's not income , it 's not gross income , it 's not taxable income .
In the case of wages , gross income is " gain derived from wages . "
Some portion of wages may not be gain .
If the entirety of wages were income , then they would be gifts or gratuities because the basis for earnings is implied to be $ 0 .
Examples of Different Sources
People get hung up on the list of sources without asking whether something is income or not .
An example of income and non-income from various sources by Thomas K. Cryer :
Example 1 : Gains on Capital
Joe places $ 100,000 in a certificate of deposit earning 6 % per annum .
Joe gave up his $ 100,000 for a year and at the end of the year he received $ 106,000 of which only $ 6,000 would be income as defined by the act .
Joe still has his original $ 100,000 and can ' rent ' it out again for another year , but he pays taxes only on the $ 6,000 gain .
Example 2 : Gains on Sales
Tom buys a widget for $ 1 and sells it for $ 2 .
Tom gave up $ 1 in order to receive $ 2 , but only the additional $ 1 is considered income .
Tom still has his dollar back and can purchase another widget to sell , but he pays taxes only on the $ 1 gain .
Example 3 : Gains on Labor
Bob pays Bill $ 50 to unplug Mrs. Haversham 's drain for which Bob charges Mrs. Haversham $ 75 .
Bob gave up $ 50 in order to receive $ 75 , but only $ 25 is considered income , his realized gain of $ 25 on Bill 's labor .
Bob still has his original $ 50 that he can use to purchase more labor that he can sell for profit , but he pays taxes only on the $ 25 gain .
But what about Bill's $ 50 ?
What has Bill given up ?
Nothing ?
Bill gave up a day out of his life , he expended his effort and skill , employed the use of his working tools .
Bill no longer has his day or his labor , both are spent .
He cannot , even with every penny of his $ 50 , buy another day or recover the effort he expended , yet according to the government , his $ 50 , every bit of it , is profit , gain , accession to wealth and was received in exchange for nothing .
What Bill gave up to receive his $ 50 was not " nothing " , it was " ' The property which every man has in his own labor , [ and ] as it is the original foundation of all other property , so it is the most sacred and inviolable .
. . .'
Adam Smith 's Wealth of Nations , Bk. I. Chap. 10 . " Butchers ' Union , supra .
Joe recovered his $ 100,000 , and paid no tax on it ;
Tom recovered his $ 1 and paid no tax on it ;
Bob recovered his $ 50 and paid no tax on it ; but Bill can neverrecover his day , energy or labor , but pays tax on his gross revenue , including the value of his day , energy and labor and even if the value of that day , energy and labor exceeds the gross revenue !
We can all agree that a person 's labor is not only his property , his capital , but that it is depleted in its employment and , eventually , is exhausted and totally spent .
We have two major , landmark Supreme Court decisions , still controlling law , dealing specifically with that issue , and the decisions of the Supreme Court in those two cases makes a conclusion that an income tax on wages is not an income tax , but a tax on gross receipts , taxing both income and capital , and , therefore , unconstitutional .

As housing leads Canada out of recession , commercial markets continue to flounder .
Economic uncertainty and high unemployment have resulted in office vacancy rates jumping to 9.8 per cent in the fourth quarter , up from 6.7 per cent a year earlier , according to a report Thursday by CB Richard Ellis Ltd .
Analysts are looking closely at Toronto and Calgary , which comprise about half of the office stock in the country , as a looming oversupply problem tips the cities firmly into tenant territory .
Low interest rates have encouraged home buyers to plow into the market , but businesses are much less confident , holding off on hiring new employees .
Toronto 's vacancy rate hit 9.4 per cent in the fourth quarter , up from 6.8 per cent a year ago .
Three new buildings this year have added nearly 3.5 million square feet downtown .
They are the 1.2 - million - square - foot RBC Centre on Wellington St. , the 1.5 - million - square - foot Bay Adelaide Centre and the 780,000 - square - foot Telus Tower on York St .
Commercial real estate conditions in Calgary remain the most severe , with fourth - quarter vacancy rates rising to 15.6 per cent from 6.3 per cent a year earlier .
The new supply means the core will be a tenant 's market , likely for five years , according to a recent forecast by Cushman & Wakefield .
The firm expects vacancies to hit 14.5 per cent by 2011 .
One bright spot in Ontario remains the Waterloo region , owing to the presence of high tech and academic industries .
Overall vacancy dropped slightly year over year in the fourth quarter to 6 per cent from 6.1 per cent last year .

In addition to identifying what he said was an important omission in the paper -- that behavioral therapy worked just as well as the drug when compared head to head in the study -- Leo also pointed out that the lead author had a financial relationship with Forest Laboratories , the maker of Lexapro , that was not disclosed in the study .
Leo says he received an angry call from JAMA executive deputy editor Phil Fontanarosa last week , shortly after Leo 's article was published on the BMJ Web site .
" He said , ' Who do you think you are , ' " says Leo .
" He then said , ' You are banned from JAMA for life .
You will be sorry .
Your school will be sorry .
Your students will be sorry . "
Fontanarosa referred a call for comment to a JAMA spokeswoman , who said Leo ’s retelling of the conversation was " inaccurate . "
" He did talk to the guy , but he said he did n’t threaten him , " the spokeswoman said .
" It was something along the lines of not setting a good example for students .
He did n't say he would be banned .
He did n’t think Leo was taking a very good approach by taking this confidential process within JAMA out to media and another medical journal .
It 's just not the way things are handled here . "
The call from Fontanarosa was followed up by ones from JAMA editor - in - chief Catherine DeAngelis to Leo ’s superiors , Leo says .
He said she asked his superiors to get him to retract his article in the BMJ .
Leo says he decided to call DeAngelis directly to find out what , in particular , she might be objecting to .
He said she was “ very upset ” but did n’t make specific complaints about the article .
Parwan province is quiet , but signs of discontent are growing
By Peter Greste
BBC News , Parwan province , Afghanistan
It is not hard to see why Alla Gul is upset .
Her two - year - old daughter cries weakly in her arms with barely enough energy to eat .
The child stares vacantly at the other patients in the Charikar hospital ward , her muscles wasted with malnutrition , her angular bones protruding like twigs beneath her papery skin .
When Alla Gul returned with her family from a refugee camp in Iran six years ago to Afghanistan , they expected better things .
The Taliban had fallen , security had returned and international aid began pouring in - billions of dollars ' worth .
" It 's indeed very difficult .
For months , we have n't been able to afford to buy meat for our children .
It 's very painful to watch , " she said .
Alla Gul 's two - year - old daughter is weak with hunger Alla Gul says she never wanted handouts .
But she and her husband - a contract farmer who gets a portion of the produce from the land he works - always believed they would lead a comfortable life .
Now , he simply can't earn enough to feed the family .
Dr Aslam Fawad is despairing .
Each day he walks the malnutrition ward , watching more and more patients arrive from across this otherwise fertile farming district .
Poverty is so deep that even many farmers are unable to feed their families .
Unicef figures show that an extensive vaccination campaign has helped more children survive , but Dr Fawad says because of the dire state of the economy , some patients keep returning , time after time .
" The malnutrition problem in Afghanistan , and especially Parwan province , is very bad .
That 's because of the years of fighting , the damage to our infrastructure and rising unemployment .
" It 's all helped to make things worse , " he said .
Deep discontent
The statistics bear him out : officially , unemployment is about 40 % , though it is probably far higher than that ; of those who do have a job in Parwan , 45 % earn less than $ 1 a day ; chronic malnutrition for children under five across Afghanistan is 54 % .
And perhaps most surprising of all , on a UN scale of human development indicators , Afghanistan has slipped from 117th in the world , to 181st - second from the bottom - since the Taliban were ousted .
Professor Sayed Massood , an economist from Kabul University , believes that backsliding is responsible for much of the deep discontent with the government , and growing support for the insurgency .
Even farm workers are suffering from malnutrition
He blames the crisis of public confidence on the policy of pouring billions of dollars in development aid into regions where the insurgency is strongest .
" Instead of the benefits [ of aid ] going to friends , they are going to enemies .
We needed to spend money in the places where the people believe in democracy and work for the government .
" But instead only the enemies are getting rich , " he said .
" We need to set examples of peaceful provinces that are also prosperous , but that 's just not happening . "
Prof Massood argues that the international community has adopted an aid policy that has been entirely counter - productive .
" They have politicised aid ; they have tried to use their money to bring about political change in the frontline provinces - they have tried to bribe their enemies .
" But they do n't understand that it works the other way around .
If you improve the economics of the people , the politics will follow .
If you do n't , you will lose them . "
That might explain why the insurgency appears to be spreading to parts of the country that until now have been relatively peaceful .
Slowly switching sides Rural Parwan province , just to the north of Kabul , is still quiet , but there are growing signs of discontent with the government , and resentment at the way the people have been neglected .
Some patients keep returning to the malnutrition ward in Charikar hospital Abdullah Khan heads another family struggling to find enough food .
He is a tractor driver , working the fields for neighbouring farms .
But a month ago , his two - year - old daughter Rabia also had to be admitted to hospital with severe malnutrition .
Rabia is recovering with Dr Fawad 's help , but several days ago his wife gave birth to another girl - one more mouth to feed just when they can least afford it .
" Instead of aid going to those like me who need it , it goes to rich , corrupt people .
I 'm very angry at the government , " Abdullah Khan said .
The government badly needs the trust of Abdullah Khan and those like him - moderates who just want a peaceful life .
But the more Afghanistan 's children suffer , the more support for the government slips , and the more it grows for the insurgency .

THE worst rains " in 1000 years " have turned streets in the United Kingdom and Ireland into rivers , forcing the evacuation of hundreds of homes in dozens of towns .
In Cumbria , bridges collapsed and main streets lay more than two metres under water as 314.4 mm of rain fell in 24 hours .
Policeman Bill Barker , 44 , drowned after falling into a swollen river when the bridge he was standing on over River Derwent collapsed .
The father of four , who would have celebrated his 45th birthday today , had been directing motorists to safety at the time .
People watched in horror as the bridge began to crack and suddenly disappeared below the waves .
The Environment Agency said that the flooding across the region was so severe that such an event was likely to happen only once in 1000 years .
The rainfall , on already saturated terrain , was the highest level measured in England since records began .
The rain was being driven by gales , some recorded as 160 km / h. Cockermouth , in Cumbria , was worst hit by the storm , with 1000 homes under water and 200 evacuated .
" The centre of Cockermouth looks like it has been completely destroyed - I 've never seen anything like it , " Red Cross worker Ian Rideout said on the " biblical " deluge .
" The water has caused so much damage that many of the homes here are completely ruined . "
The situation is expected to get worse with further torrential rain expected to hit the region over the next 48 hours .
Last night , hundreds of flood warnings remained in place across the North West of England , parts of Wales , Scotland , Northern Ireland and Ireland .
People were still being rescued as rivers continued to swell about the Lakes District area .
" I am deeply concerned and saddened by the dreadful flooding across Britain , " the Queen said yesterday as she offered sympathy to those hit by the " devastating " floods , including Constable Barker 's family .
The damage bill in England alone is expected to be at least A$ 200 million .
In Ireland , Environment Minister John Gormley declared parts of his country a disaster with Cork , Clare and Galway hardest hit .
Soldiers in trucks and flat bottom boats have been deployed to rescue people stranded in homes or in their cars .
Major freeways have been cut , stranding many motorists trying to flee their homes about the south - west .
" These are some of the worst floods we have seen in many parts of the country in living memory and our priority must be to help those people whose lives and livelihoods have been so badly hit by these events , " he said .
A hospital had to be evacuated in Cork as a wall collapsed and the Lee River burst its banks .
Now that the nine big banks that received TARP funds have repaid the government , Wall Street and Washington are heralding a return to normalcy .
But the status quo ex ante has not been restored .
The bailout of failing financial institutions , and the willingness of corporate leaders to slurp up taxpayer handouts , has created a frighteningly familiar dynamic .
Few people would suggest cloning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) now in conservatorship - limbo , ...
Leslie Rock , a Beacon
Hill resident who pays AT&T roughly $ 30 a month to connect her iPhone to the Internet , today filed a class - action lawsuit in US District Court in Boston that charges the company is illegally collecting taxes on the service .
In her complaint , Rock seeks to establish a class of Massachusetts residents who , collectively , are owed $ 10 million because federal and state law prohibits taxes on Internet services .
However , the suit also alleges these " thousands of individuals " are being charged both state and local sales tax on the service even though Massachusetts cities and towns have no local sales taxes .
Complete complaint .
For a few paragraphs , simple labels will do : Soldier No. 1 and Soldier No. 2 .
Besides serving in the wartime military , they did n’t appear at first glance to have been much alike .
They were born in dramatically disparate cultural eras , Soldier No. 1 amid World War II home - front anxiety and rationing , Soldier No. 2 in a time of hippies and free living , during the Summer of Love .
No. 1 was reared on the country ’s southeastern jut , in Miami , and No. 2 grew up on its western rim , in South Pasadena , Calif .
Atlantic boy , Pacific boy .
No. 1 was a junior college dropout ; No. 2 — who had been a high school football team captain and a surfer — won a degree after majoring in criminal justice at Cal State Long Beach and later was a graduate student .
The first ended up in a store where customers were urged to consider the attractive features of wristwatches and rings .
The second had a less cooperative and rougher - hewn clientele :
He walked the thin blue line , a member of the Los Angeles Police Department .
The difference between them that was biggest — profound would be a better word — lay in what they did when they were in the U.S. Army .
Soldier No. 2 won praise ; his commander once called him “ one of the [ battalion ’s ] finest , if not the finest young officer . ”
No such accolade for Soldier No. 1 .
He emerged a moral monster who had brought atrocious disgrace to himself , his uniform and his nation .
But whatever their differences , in the end they had a terrible element in common , which we shall soon see .
The lives of both were marked by deep calamity , and their tragedies — shaped by a monumental national force — deserve retelling for the lessons they hold for Americans singly and as a people .
Especially in view of Barack Obama ’s announcement Tuesday of a major escalation in the Afghanistan war .
A seemingly enlightened president , with the apparent acquiescence of much of Congress and , yes , the voters , has chosen to hurl more lives into the maw of warfare .
Of course , Obama ’s approach to the Afghanistan issue has been known since the presidential campaign , when the Illinois senator made clear that he thought military emphasis needed to be moved to that nation .
Still , the decision is a grating disappointment to those who had hoped that Obama would shift his view after it became clear to him in the Oval Office that U.S. military participation in the Afghanistan conflict is elective and not vital to our interests .
There ’s no need here to deal much with why it was not necessary or wise for the United States to invade Iraq and Afghanistan .
Countless articles have been written on the subject : the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , the lack of a connection of Iraq to 9/11 , the historical inability of invaders to conquer Afghanistan , the illogic of invading a nation because a cell of religious zealots carried out a despicable crime in our country , etc .
Soldier No. 1 and Soldier No. 2 stand here not so much as individuals but as symbols , reflecting what our national policies have done to harm scores of thousands of young and not so young Americans .
Their cases are instructive and can direct light onto the human consequences of sending troops across seas to fight unnecessarily .
Let ’s look at what happened to two of our warriors .

Soldier No. 1 : The Cries for Mercy Still Echo
Last summer , a man on the cusp of old age said he was sorry for something he did long ago .
Normally , such a declaration does n’t extend past the hearing of an aggrieved wife or an adult offspring with a wounded past , but in this case there were ripples that reached across the nation and even into foreign countries .
The Associated Press and other major news conduits did n’t latch on to the story immediately , so the information took a couple of days to spread widely out of Columbus , Ga. , a city of 190,000 that does n’t often attract the attention of the big media .
The unlikely news scene was a meeting of the Kiwanis Club of Greater Columbus .
No members of the professional press were there to hear the invited guest who addressed the volunteer organization that day : a 66 - year - old Atlanta resident named William Calley .
William Calley .
For Americans of a certain age , the name sets off a firecracker in the brain , an explosion of memories of one of the most notorious criminals of the 20th century .
Apologists will passionately object to that characterization of Calley , but it ’s accurate .
A criminal : convicted as a mass murderer and given a life sentence at hard labor at a 1971 Army court - martial .
Notorious : many millions of words spoken or written in reaction to disclosures that left the nation sick with revulsion .
( Although Internet and print sources have thousands of references to Calley ’s “ pardon ” by Richard Nixon , according to my reading of the case the then - president never took any such action , although he did intervene otherwise ; Calley ’s criminal conviction was never expunged . )
Calley was infamous enough to provoke a damning reference in a protest song written by the legendary Pete Seeger , “ Last Train to Nuremberg , ” and to inspire a heroic portrayal in “ The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley ” — a spoken song , set to the tune of “ The Battle Hymn of the Republic ” ( ! ) , that penetrated the top 50 on Billboard ’s Hot 100 and Hot Country Singles .
Hot indeed , our Mr. Calley .
In 1975 there was a television drama about his trial .
He would write an as - told - to autobiography , and many books have dealt with his case and the events that seared the words My Lai into the American annals .
It would not be a stretch to say that his name was among those most recognized across the country at the beginning of the 1970s .
After a string of rather complicated legal actions , Calley went free in 1974 .
He soon faded into obscurity , working at the Atlanta jewelry store of his father - in - law .
It was not until Aug. 19 of this year — almost 35 years after he was released from custody — that he spoke out publicly , in person , about My Lai and how his feelings about it had evolved .
Recording Calley ’s words at the Kiwanis meeting was Dick McMichael , a retired broadcast journalist who wrote the story on his personal blog and then in an Aug. 22 bylined article in Columbus ’ Ledger - Enquirer .
It was McMichael ’s Ledger - Enquirer account that was widely quoted when international media got wind of what Calley had said .
The article in the small daily quickly got to the meat of the matter :
William Calley , the former Army lieutenant convicted on 22 counts of murder in the infamous My Lai Massacre in Vietnam , publicly apologized for the first time this week while speaking in Columbus .
“ There is not a day that goes by that I do not feel remorse for what happened that day in My Lai , ” Calley told members of the Kiwanis Club of Greater Columbus on Wednesday .
His voice started to break when he added , “ I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed , for their families , for the American soldiers involved and their families .
I am very sorry . ” … …
When asked if obeying an unlawful order was not itself an unlawful act , he said , “ I believe that is true .
If you are asking why I did not stand up to them when I was given the orders , I will have to say that I was a second lieutenant getting orders from my commander and I followed them — foolishly , I guess . ”
Calley then said that was not an excuse ; it was just what happened .
The officer Calley said gave those orders was Capt .
Ernest Medina , who was also tried for what happened at My Lai .
Represented by the renowned Defense Attorney F. Lee Bailey , Medina was acquitted of all charges in 1971 .
William Laws Calley was 24 years old on March 16 , 1968 , when he trudged into the Vietnamese hamlet of My Lai .
Until then , the young Floridian had done little in his life that made him stand out , either positively or negatively .
Before he joined the Army he had attended a junior college , but his grades were bad and he dropped out .
Eventually he enlisted in the Army , and after officer training at Fort Benning in Georgia he was commissioned as a second lieutenant .
“ Rusty ” Calley — 5 feet , 4 inches tall — was a leader of men by decree of the U.S. government .
Later , in an Army investigation , men who had been in Calley ’s platoon said he was not liked and was seen as lacking common sense .
Some even reported that there had been talk of “ fragging ” him ( the term , derived from fragmentation grenade , came to mean killing a superior officer during the Vietnam War ) .
Exactly what happened at My Lai , and exactly why it happened , may never be known .
What is known is that hundreds of Vietnamese villagers — perhaps as many as 504 — died that day at the hands of troops from a land that prides itself on being the home of the good guys .
In the forefront of slaughter were William Calley and at least part of his platoon .
Most of the victims were women , children and elderly people .
Some were raped or tortured in other ways .
Here ’s one nauseating quote from an eyewitness questioned by Army investigators : “ [ One of the U.S. soldiers at My Lai ] fired at [ a baby ] with a .45 .
He missed .
We all laughed .
He got up three or four feet closer and missed again .
We laughed .
Then he got up right on top and plugged him . ”
Many Americans were surprised to see Calley and My Lai back in the news near the end of the first decade of the 21st century .
After all , more than 12,000 days had passed since the last member of the American fighting force was removed from Vietnam , airlifted by helicopter from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon on a spring day in 1975 .
A new generation of Americans has arisen since then , and today the nation has new worries — including , sadly , new wars .
Old film and video clips of Woodstock , the Kent State killings and Haight - Ashbury doings still are seen occasionally , but the milieu of the late 1960s and early ’ 70s is little known to many Americans born since then , and indeed is dimming in the memory of some of the folks who camped in the mud at Max Yasgur ’s farm in New York state , or claimed they did .
It was a time of passionate division over the Vietnam War and of confrontation about communism , an incendiary public debate whose embers still glow after four decades .
The survivors of the anti-Red campaign of the 1960s and ’ 70s surely must be chagrined today when they look to the Far East and see the evil Communist Chinese playing banker to a U.S. whose faith in capitalism has been shaken by a series of near - catastrophic economic events .
Another disconcerting object in their field of vision is Vietnam , a repository of American bones but also a nation that has metamorphosed in nearly stunning ways .
Today , Vietnam is a member of the United Nations and one of our trading partners .
It had an average rise in gross domestic product of more than 7 percent annually from 2000 to 2007 .
The American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam has a chapter in Ho Chi Minh City , once known as Saigon .
Vietnam.com — “ your official Vietnam travel guide ” — offers , for a fee , to expose you to the delights of Ho Chi Minh City , Hanoi and Hue .
Today ’s state of affairs probably would not be much different if 58,000 Americans had not died in the Vietnam War .
It is a bitter and sobering thought that so many thousands of U.S. military personnel perished for so little benefit to the nation that foolishly sent them into what amounted to a civil war .
The prime architect of the Vietnam War , Robert McNamara , would later admit that Washington ’s actions had been “ wrong , terribly wrong . ”
The one - time secretary of defense went to his grave this year burdened with sorrow for his role in the conflict .
Because of audiotapes now made public , we know of President Lyndon B. Johnson ’s anguish over sending more troops to Vietnam , an anguish he concealed from the nation he led .
Before he ordered a military buildup , he told national security adviser McGeorge Bundy in 1964 : “ The more I think about this , I do n’t know what in the hell .
…
Looks to me like we ’re getting into another Korea .
It just worries the hell out of me . … I do n’t think it ’s worth fighting for . ”
But the United States did fight the war , however worthless it might have been , and as a result the presidency of a man who envisioned a Great Society fell in shards .
Johnson had been goaded toward escalation by influential advisers including Bundy .
William Pfaff , in his column that appeared Nov. 24 on Truthdig , quotes from the recently published and aptly titled “ Lessons in Disaster : McGeorge Bundy and the Path to War in Vietnam , ” by Gordon M. Goldstein .
Pfaff tells of a 1967 memo from Bundy to Johnson saying , “ The fact that South Vietnam has not been lost , and is not going to be lost , is a fact of truly massive importance in the history of Asia , the Pacific and the United States . ”
Pfaff then writes : “ Looking back at the memo , nearly 30 years after he had written it in triumph , he [ McGeorge Bundy ] noted on it , for Goldstein to read and quote , ‘ McGB all wrong . ’ ”
All wrong .
Surely one of the strongest and most compact self - condemnations ever written by a former presidential lieutenant .
The U.S. public has overwhelmingly acknowledged that the country should not have gotten militarily involved in Vietnam .
The Gallup Poll said : “ … [ I ] n retrospect , Americans feel it was a mistake to send troops to Vietnam .
Three polls conducted from 1990 to 2000 found about seven in 10 Americans saying it was a mistake . ”
The nation slipped into the Vietnam swamp bit by bit , under four presidents .
None of those presidents — whatever their moral or political defects might have been — shipped soldiers to that Asian land to pursue a military campaign for gold or petroleum or territory .
The stated goal was loftier and arguably less material : to save the world — or at least the United States — from communism .
As it turned out , communism was a cardboard tiger that not only could n’t devour the planet but generally could n’t even save itself .
Today only Vietnam and four other nations are officially communist … and two of the five ( Vietnam and China ) , at least when it comes to commercial expansion , look as though they were brought up by a money - hungry Uncle Sam rather than an anti-capitalist Papa Karl Marx .
An appalling portion of the United States ’ young population was squandered in Vietnam because U.S. leaders had forgotten a fundamental rule of poker :
You ’ve got to know when to fold .
Starting in 1962 , more and more Americans were tossed into the pot each year as the troop level surged : 8,498 … 15,620 … 17,280 … 129,611 … 317,007 … 451,752 … 537,377 .
Ever bigger wagers were made in a futile attempt to save a bad bet .
Even in 1971 , after a couple of years of U.S. pullback , the American deployment remained at more than 200,000 .
The mission in Vietnam was disastrously wrong - headed , and much American treasure and blood could have been spared if our leaders simply had had the political guts to say : “ Enough .
This is not working .
Let ’s go home . ”

Soldier No. 2 : ‘ Numb and Withdrawn Upstairs ’
The story of Peter Sinclair is poignantly laid out by staff writer Jia-Rui Chong in a Page 1 story in the Nov. 2 Los Angeles Times .
When Sinclair was 20 , he enlisted in the Army and later was sent off to the Persian Gulf War .
Afterward , he became an L.A. cop and a member of the Army Reserve .
In the first year of the Iraq war , he was back in the regular Army .
Chong writes :
Pete ’s unit was quickly caught up in insurgent attacks .
His base at Al Taqaddum , about 45 miles west of Baghdad , was shelled as often as 56 times an hour , according to a sergeant stationed there .
In Balad , north of the capital , a rocket explosion threw Pete , who was asleep , from his cot onto the floor .
“ I ’m happy just to be alive today , ” he wrote home . … …
His injuries [ back injuries suffered in the Army and on police duty ] were exacerbated by the weight of his body armor and the constant jostling in Humvees .
Sometimes he experienced spasms in his lower back so severe he could not walk .
Sometimes it hurt so bad he had trouble speaking .
Painkillers , muscle relaxers , ibuprofen and Valium offered relief , but Pete struggled with the realities of war .
He saw a Marine torn apart by a rocket .
He came across mutilated bodies hanging from a bridge .
Then there was a ride through Baghdad in the fall of 2004 .
Soldiers had been handing out candy to children to celebrate the opening of a sewage treatment plant when a bomb went off .
More than 40 people , mostly children , died ; dismembered bodies littered the street .
Pete ’s convoy rolled through the aftermath .
Two weeks later , he e-mailed his sister about his nightmares : standing in city streets surrounded by body parts and blood .
“ I am pretty numb and withdrawn upstairs , ” he wrote .
Sinclair returned from Iraq a captain — and a man tortured in body and mind .
He was at times deeply distressed , and prescription drugs became an important part of his effort to survive .
In 2006 he threatened to shoot himself , and later cut his wrist with a knife .
The following year , the Army ruled that Sinclair — who had been in hospitals and under various treatments — was suffering from severe post - traumatic stress disorder .
He had told his Army examiners , in part : “ I had a good , solid career .
I was moving up .
Everything was great .
And now , you know , I ca n’t even pick up a book and read it and I ’m scared .
I ’m afraid to go outside . ”
At one point after leaving the Army the former captain expressed worry about becoming addicted to the prescribed morphine , oxycodone and Valium he was taking .
Sinclair fell in love with a schoolteacher and talked of marriage ; perhaps brighter days lay ahead .
But last year Peter Courtney Sinclair , a child of sunny Southern California , died in a dark cloud wrought by bodily and mental devils .
The official finding : morphine intoxication , accidental .
The life that ended in 2008 had begun 40 years earlier — just months before Rusty Calley led a platoon into My Lai with murder in his heart .

More PTSD , More Suicides , More Divorces
Sinclair ’s story is sad by almost any measure , but sadder still is the fact that he must be counted among thousands of U.S. military people taken down , often fatally , by post - traumatic stress disorder , sometimes in conjunction with physical medical conditions incurred in the military or aggravated by wartime service .
Veterans for Common Sense , an aid organization , has said that as of last Dec. 15 the Department of Veterans Affairs had diagnosed PTSD in 115,000 U.S. veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
Last year a study by the Army surgeon general found that an appalling percentage of soldiers on their third or fourth tours had experienced emotional illnesses .
USA Today , citing the Army report , wrote :
From 15 % to 20 % of all soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan show signs of depression or post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , says the study of almost 2,300 soldiers finished last fall [ 2007 ] .
That rate jumps to about 30 % for soldiers who have been on three or four combat deployments . …
The report underscores concerns raised by military leaders that the current year - long break soldiers receive between successive 12 - to 15 - month combat deployments is far too short for them to recover .
One simple but incisive insight into the problem stands out : “ People are n’t designed to be exposed to the horrors of combat repeatedly , and it wears on them . ”
The originator of that 2008 quotation was not some timid , pacifist lefty ; it was a man who well knows war ’s violence and soldiers — Gen. George Casey , Army chief of staff .
The increasing strain on America ’s thinly stretched fighting forces and the effects of that pressure have long been evident , and much has been said about the issue .
Apart from the growing incidence of PTSD , suicide among soldiers has become a source of grave concern in the Army , which in January reported that the problem was the worst it had been in 28 years of tracking .
Last month , Gen. Peter Chiarelli , the Army ’s vice chief of staff , told the Pentagon : “ We are almost certainly going to end [ this ] year higher [ in suicides ] than last year .
…
This is horrible . … ”
And just last Friday it was disclosed that the divorce rate in Army families is up in 2009 .
The Associated Press wrote : “ The toll for a nation long at war is evident in military homes :
The divorce rate in the armed forces edged up again in the past year despite many programs to help struggling couples . … ”
Still another sign of the psychic damage being suffered by the men and women of America ’s armed forces .
Perhaps the best judges of the condition of today ’s U.S. armed services are the officers themselves .
In February of 2008 , a survey of officers , both current and retired , found nine in 10 saying the Iraq war had stretched the American military “ dangerously thin ” ( although a majority maintained that morale remained high ) .
An article on the survey stated : “ Gen . Casey has warned that the military was deploying at unsustainable rates , and was in danger of crossing a ‘ red line ’ beyond which it would take a generation to rebuild . ”
In the face of this ever - growing mound of evidence that individual soldiers and the Army overall are under dangerous tensions , it ’s hard to argue that things are just fine in the U.S. military .
So , we support the troops by finding ways to ease their burdens , do n’t we ?
No , that would only be too sane .
In an era with no draft , we have now chosen to support the troops by heaping upon them more responsibility , more work , more war , more physical and psychological trauma .
Thirty thousand more troops for fighting in Afghanistan ?
Sure , why not ?
It ’s not as though there are any human costs to be paid ( and this is to say nothing of the astronomical financial costs ) .
Besides , it ’s not as though we are fighting in Afghanistan without unstinting help from our international allies .
According to a report in April by Britain ’s Times , in response to “ an impassioned plea ” for troops for Afghanistan that President Obama made on a visit to Europe , “ [ British Prime Minister ] Gordon Brown was the only one to offer substantial help .
…
Just two other allies made firm offers of troops .
Belgium offered to send 35 military trainers and Spain offered 12 .
Mr Obama ’s host , [ French President ] Nicolas Sarkozy , refused his request . ”
Thirty - five from Belgium ?
Twelve from Spain ?
Zero from France ?
Is it possible that our friends know something we do n’t ?
[ Editor ’s note : After this was written , the U.S. ambassador to NATO said he expected NATO allies to send 5,000 more troops to Afghanistan next year .
He also said he could not report yet which countries would dispatch the troops and how many each would deploy .
In another new report , NATO estimated the alliance ’s coming deployment at 7,000 .
The articles suggested that France and some other NATO countries might decline to send personnel ; some others would not commit to any deployment numbers .
And , as the Los Angeles Times reported Dec. 4 , “ The new troop commitment , announced at a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels , includes about 2,500 soldiers who are already in the Central Asian nation . …
[ M ] any … put limits on their soldiers ’ participation in combat , making them less valuable from the American perspective . ”

Bad Judgment , Militarism and Hubris
The lives of Lt. William Calley and Capt. Peter Sinclair — one the villain , one the victim — both were ruined by the United States ’ bad judgment , militarism , hubris and imperial leanings .
Add to that list a twisted notion of exceptionalism , an idea that God has ordained us to teach the world how to live .
In short , the two men , along with thousands of their comrades , were done in by national policy .
Both were sent to wars that were purely elective for the U.S.
The reasons for fighting the conflicts lived mainly in the minds of politicians , not in the realm of need ; there were alternatives to getting militarily involved , but these were ignored in favor of exercising force of arms .
The North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong did not invade Hawaii , California , Oregon , Washington or any other U.S. soil .
Even the famous “ Gulf of Tonkin Incident ” — which opened the way for the U.S. to use military force in Southeast Asia without a declaration of war — turned out to be a half - baked justification built partly on fantasy .
President Johnson said in commenting to his press secretary , Bill Moyers , about what happened between the U.S. Navy and the North Vietnamese boats in the Gulf of Tonkin , “ For all I know , our Navy was shooting at whales out there . ”
The nation would have been better off had it heeded boxer Muhammad Ali , who , when he refused to be drafted , said in 1966 , “ I ai n’t got no quarrel with them Viet Cong . ” U.S. leaders , of course , did have a quarrel with them Viet Cong and them North Vietnamese , and that disagreement ended up killing nearly 60,000 Americans and contributing to the deaths of millions of Asians , civilian and military — none of whom were U.S. presidents , cabinet members , top- ranking civilian advisers or members of Congress .
In our national arrogance we put weapons in the hands of Americans and sent them abroad , where more than a few of them learned that all of those strange little people were enemies fit to be killed , even the old ones , even the females , even the children , including the babies .
This article is no apology for Calley , because none can be made for him .
No doubt , murderous bigotry against anyone who looked like the enemy found fertile soil in the lieutenant .
But his nation ’s culpability cannot be discounted .
We as a people trained him and armed him and sent him across the Pacific to do violence to an imagined enemy , and he carried out that charge with almost unimaginable enthusiasm .
To be sure , we did not send him there with instructions to massacre the innocent ; nor did his military training call for mowing down unarmed peasants .
But we did create a situation in which body count was king — a situation conducive to indiscriminate killing .
And our frustration over being unable to rout the enemy engendered ever more extreme military measures , on the ground and in the air .
There is no way of knowing how many “ Little Calleys ” there were in Vietnam , Americans who committed lesser atrocities against innocent Vietnamese .
And few higher - ups who set policy and tone ever had to answer for misdeeds .
Calley was caught and he went to jail , while superiors at various levels who egged him on toward the slaughter went free .
If readers want to drew any parallels between this and the crimes at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , they are given free rein to do so .
None of this is meant to indict the GIs and officers who served honorably in Vietnam .
Those of Calley ’s ilk were a microscopic segment , and his deeds at My Lai found infamy because such actions were so far from the norm .
Few American fighting men took lasting delight in seeing fellow human beings — battlefield enemy or not — blasted to bits or burned beyond recognition .
Our national store of compassion is not a false myth .
The percentage of our countrymen who would repeatedly shoot at and then kill an infant must be close to zero .
But some would do so , and have done so , especially after themselves being wounded physically or psychologically .
William Calley and Peter Sinclair — the brute and the brutalized — both were victims of U.S. eagerness to settle affairs by duking it out with other countries : one man thrust into a situation that called out the beast within him , the other savaged by beastly experiences .
Brutes themselves are born in traumatic events .
According to USA today , the Army ’s 2008 study of PTSD found that “ [ s] oldiers in combat suffering emotional issues and who saw friends killed were twice as likely to abuse civilians by kicking or hitting them , or destroying their property .
…
Half of those soldiers admitted unethical conduct compared with a quarter of all other soldiers in combat . ”

President Obama is , I believe , personally a decent , moral man .
But he is a politician , too , and he is not being straightforward with Americans .
His speech at West Point on Tuesday carried the scent of mendacity — a whiff of wartime speeches by Johnson , Nixon and ( dare I say it ? )
George W. Bush .
To argue that we must conquer a nation to prevent a handful of Muslim extremists from hatching activities that could be plotted in any apartment in any country of the world pushes against the boundaries of common sense .
When we finally subdue the bad guys in Afghanistan and make Pakistan secure , will aggrieved Islamic fanatics around the globe suddenly say , “ Well , that ’s that . ….
Now we love the Yankees ” ?
Obama was quick to whip out the national security card .
He said : “ If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan , I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow .
So no — I do not make this decision lightly .
I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan . ”
One can almost hear echoes of presidential speeches from the 1960s and 1970s in which the word Vietnam fills in for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
At least Obama did not tell us there was “ light at the end of the tunnel , ” a phrase that fell from the lips of more than one government official or military leader during the Vietnam era .
And mercifully we did not hear a sentence that was popular among Vietnam hawks :
“ If we do n’t fight them there we ’ll be fighting them here . ”
But the old messages of “ we will win if we stay the course ” and “ be afraid , be very afraid ” were subtext .
Perhaps the reason Obama took such pains to assure us that Afghanistan is not another Vietnam was because of the pesky pile of evidence that that ’s exactly what it is .
We will come out of Iraq and Afghanistan much as we came out of Vietnam , with nothing to show for it except huge bills and death lists and unknown numbers of U.S. combatants who were either turned into evildoers or wounded beyond healing in body or spirit .
That ’s what war produces .
By subjecting participants to almost unthinkable horrors , it turns a small but disturbing percentage of them into something horrible or horribly pitiful : a Calley reviled and everlastingly racked with regret ; a Sinclair deeply afflicted and then dying because of an accident with pills .
All need our compassion and , when necessary , our forgiveness .
If a war is unavoidable — as was our struggle against the Axis powers in World War II — armed services personnel must be asked to pay whatever the price is for the survival of the nation .
And they must bear whatever human consequences come .
But the Iraq war was and is not necessary , and the Afghanistan war was and is not necessary .
Pat Tillman should be on an NFL field today , not dead .
The Afghanistan surge announced Tuesday is a blow against American military men and women .
Most will be worse for the experience if they are sent to a war that pits Afghans against Afghans , and Americans against whoever happens to hate them most at the moment .
They deserve better from our leaders and from us .
They deserve to be home .

ORIGINAL 1953 " STATE SECRETS " RULING DISPUTED
FERC ADOPTS " NEED TO KNOW " INFO POLICY
BIOSECURITY & BIOTERRORISM JOURNAL
THE WOODWARD EXCEPTION TO CLASSIFICATION
A 1953 Supreme Court decision that is one of the cornerstones of national security secrecy policy relied on false government information , the Court was told in a startling petition filed last week .
The decision , United States v. Reynolds , is the judicial foundation of the " state secrets privilege . "
It provides the precedential basis for asserting that there are " military matters which , in the interest of national security , should not be divulged , " not even to a federal court .
The Reynolds case originated over 50 years ago when the widows of three crew members who died in a 1948 crash of a B - 29 Superfortress bomber requested accident reports on the crash .
The Air Force denied the request and filed affidavits with the Supreme Court claiming that the withheld reports contained information about the aircraft 's secret mission and described secret electronic equipment on board that had to be protected from disclosure .
The Court , citing that claim , ruled in favor of the Air Force and established the state secrets privilege .
" But it turns out that the Air Force 's affidavits were false , " according to the new petition filed by the surviving widows or their heirs .
The recently declassified Air Force accident reports contain nothing whatsoever about a secret mission or sensitive electronic equipment .
" In telling the Court otherwise , the Air Force lied , " the Petitioners said .
The petitioners want the Court to vacate the 1953 Reynolds decision ( 345 U.S. 1 ( 1953 ) ) .
But they take no position on the body of law that derives from it .
" Whether the legal principles established in Reynolds are right or wrong is for another day and another case . "
" For petitioners , the only issue this Court must confront today is whether it will tolerate a fraud -- a fraud that struck at the integrity of the Court 's decision - making process and that cheated three struggling widows and their children out of that which was rightly theirs . "
See the February 26 " Petition for a Writ of Error Coram Nobis to Remedy Fraud Upon This Court " here :
A supplementary appendix including original case files and the declassified accident reports is here :
The Justice Department has not yet commented on the matter .
FERC ADOPTS " NEED TO KNOW " INFO POLICY
In an potentially momentous change in government information policy , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) will now process public requests for access to certain kinds of sensitive energy infrastructure information selectively , depending on who the requester is and why the information is sought .
Requesters will have to provide a " detailed statement explaining the particular need for and intended use of the information " that will then be evaluated by an agency official .
In effect , the new policy imposes a differential " need to know " standard on members of the public .
The policy is intended to protect " critical energy infrastructure information , " i.e. critical infrastructure information that " relates to the production , generation , transportation , transmission , or distribution of energy [ and ] could be useful to a person in planning an attack .... "
" These new steps will help keep sensitive infrastructure information out of the public domain , decreasing the likelihood that such information could be used to plan or execute terrorist attacks , " according to the new statement of policy .
FERC downplayed any potential adverse impact of the move , arguing that the alternative to selective disclosure of such information was no disclosure at all .
And while access to " critical energy infrastructure information " would be denied to ordinary requesters under the Freedom of Information Act , the Commission indicated that " state agencies , landowners , environmental groups [ and others ] may be found to have a need for [ such ] information in a particular situation . "
The text of the new rule , as published in the Federal Register on March 3 , may be found here :
BIOSECURITY & BIOTERRORISM JOURNAL
" It is imperative that there be an informed , vigorous , and wide - ranging public discussion about the bio-weapons threat and what to do about it , " write Tara O'Toole and Thomas V. Inglesby of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies .
They are the co-editors of " Biosecurity and Bioterrorism , " a new peer - reviewed quarterly journal that is intended " to foster a deepening understanding of the threat posed by biological weapons and to broaden the spectrum of people who are knowledgeable in these realms . "
Further information , including a promising selection of articles from the first issue , may be found here :
THE WOODWARD EXCEPTION TO CLASSIFICATION
The political abuse of the national security classification system is shockingly manifest in Bob Woodward 's best - selling book " Bush at War , " the conservative watchdog group Accuracy in Media ( AIM ) complained in its latest publication .
" CIA Director [ George J. ]
Tenet clearly authorized Woodward to republish the contents of the President 's Daily Briefing ( PDB ) .... [ Yet ]
Tenet adamantly refused to provide copies of the PDB to congressional investigators probing intelligence failures prior to 9/11 and got the White House to exercise its executive privilege weapon to block Capitol Hill 's access to back PDB copies .
Executive privilege clearly does not apply to Woodward , " according to the AIM Report , edited by Cliff Kincaid and Notra Trulock .
" Had the leaks not come from Tenet directly , government security officials would be preparing ' damage assessments ' to show how much classified intelligence had been revealed and how the leaks had harmed the nation 's ability to collect that intelligence in the future .
Intelligence officials would be sending ' referrals ' to the Justice Department urging a full - scale leak investigation .
It 's a safe bet that none of that will happen and that security officials will reserve their wrath for low - level violators , " AIM concluded .
The AIM report tends to be overwrought and accusatory ; it assumes what it cannot prove , and the authors ' critique is diminished by their evident animosity towards Woodward , Tenet and others .
But it serves as a timely reminder that the classification system is a political artifact and is susceptible to political abuse .

Earlier today we discussed Neel Kashkari's weight problem ( he 's determined to lose the 20 pounds he gained while working for the Treasury ) .
We thought it seemed a bit extreme that he would , by his own admission , skip dinner many nights in order to reach his target , but now it 's all become clear .
He 's on a deadline to look good in a bathing suit , having taken a gig with PIMCO in Newport Beach .
Here 's the full letter from Bill Gross and and Mohamed El - Erian to clients ( courtesty of a Dealbreaker Commenter ) :
Throughout this process , our objective has remained the preservation and enrichment of the investment and retirement assets that you have entrusted to PIMCO .
We plan to continue the focus and determination that you have come to expect from our firm for almost forty years .
Perhaps less visible to you is the effort that we have made to ensure that our institutional platform and approaches are positioned to serve you in the best and most sustainable manner possible .
We recognize that the implications of the new normal for the investment management industry go well beyond adapting investment strategies .
There are important consequences for other parts of what makes PIMCO effective in meeting your needs .
Specifically , today 's ongoing global transformations are impacting the design of investment products , the manner in which we interact with our clients , and the way we run our business .
And all this influences the scope and organization of our human and technical resources .
We have already taken a series of steps to further enhance our client servicing , to expand and adapt our product line , and to strengthen our business platform .
Having emerged from the global financial crisis stronger - in both absolute and relative terms - PIMCO has been able to deepen its capabilities by adding top talent , as well as increase spending on technology and analytics .
Today we will publicly announce another important step that is part of our efforts to ensure that the firm continues to evolve and meet your investment needs in the future .
Specifically - and after a multiyear process of internal assessment , consultation with outside experts , and interviews of many teams - PIMCO will announce the hiring of a highly experienced and successful equity team .
Anne Gudefin and Chuck Lahr are joining us as global equity portfolio managers .
They come to us after a highly successful tenure at the Mutual Series of Franklin Templeton where they were the co-portfolio managers for the Franklin Mutual Global Discovery Fund .
Anne will begin in early Jan. 2010 , and she will be based in our London office .
Chuck begins today and he will be based in our New York office .
Why is PIMCO expanding into active equity management at this time ?
For three main reasons :
• First , and foremost , because we recognize that your needs , as our clients , are also evolving .
We have heard you emphasize investment solutions as well as products ; and we have already worked closely with several of you in designing multi-asset class approaches that are supplemented by appropriate and cost - effective risk management .
• Second , we believe that PIMCO 's time tested investment process can , and will , strongly supplement bottom - up equity management expertise , especially at a time of great fluidity in the global economy and in the capital structures of companies .
• Third , in Anne and Chuck , we have found great experienced complements to the PIMCO investment philosophy and process .
Our firm has continuously evolved throughout our history , drawing strength from a proven investment process and the depth and breadth of our resources .
PIMCO 's entry into active equity management is another example of this evolution .
And consistent with what has served our clients well in the past , this evolution will be measured and disciplined .
And , critically , it is aimed at providing you with the best investment management services in the world .
In addition to hiring a top equity team , we have also recognized the need for an experienced person to work closely with PIMCO 's Executive Committee to lead our entry into this and other new businesses over time .
Accordingly , Neel Kashkari is joining us on December 14 to lead new investment initiatives .
Neel will be based in our Newport Beach office .
Many of you may know of Neel from his previous responsibilities at the US Treasury where , until May 2009 , he served as Assistant Secretary .
Neel quickly established himself as a " go - to " person during the global crisis .
We are confident that his skill set will be of direct long - term benefit to our clients - mainly in the positive sense of bringing more talent to PIMCO but also in ensuring that we do not inappropriately divert the focus of other colleagues devoted to what we already deliver to you .
All these steps are part of PIMCO 's evolution over the last decade that has already taken us beyond being solely focused on core fixed income .
By adding active equities to the range of solutions PIMCO provides , our primary aim remains the same as it as been throughout PIMCO 's history : to serve as a trusted advisor to our clients around the world .
Importantly , this has not , nor will it distract or detract us from our ongoing management of our fixed income products .
It 's an evolutionary process - not a revolutionary event - that has been driven by the needs of our clients , the entrepreneurship of our colleagues , and the robustness of our investment process and platform .
In closing , please allow us to wish you the very best for the holiday seasons and the New Year .
Thank you again for your trust in PIMCO .
We are fully committed to continuing to deliver to you the best investment management services .
With our best regards
Bill Gross

I ’ve read my share of columns on police abuse and the police state .
I ’ve seen my share of videos on YouTube of police abusing people for the most mundane things like speeding , riding a bike on a sidewalk , riding a bike down the street , and , civil , non-violent protest .
But until just recently I had n’t experienced it myself firsthand .
I was down in Chinatown in Washington DC for dinner and a movie .
After leaving the movie theater I noticed cops parked on the side of the road in front of the movie theater .
These cops had out their little pen lights and they were randomly pulling over passing drivers .
I crossed the street and saw a small gathering of other folks standing there watching what was going on .
Each asking the other : u201 Cdo you know what they are doing ?
u201D
Nobody seemed to know for sure but we all know what it looked like .
It looked like a scene out of Nazi Germany or Communist Russia : you papers please .
As we all stood there looking on a black teenager came whizzing by us on his skateboard .
He skated across the street , past the cops and on down the road .
As the cops saw him skate by they yelled something at him that was too intelligible for us to understand .
I would imagine it was too intelligible for the skateboarder to understand as well because he turned and looked and kept on his way another 20 feet or so .
That ’s when our heroic blue uniformed doughnut feeders leapt into action like Boy George at a Liberace concert .
They took off running at full speed after this felonious social miscreant who so arrogantly and willfully did n’t kowtow to the fact that they said something .
Once the young man saw the cops running after him he voluntarily stopped his skateboard and stood there in the street waiting for the eggheads to catch up .
Once they did they grabbed him as if they had cornered the devil himself and cattle rustled him up onto the sidewalk and up against the wall .
They forcibly held one arm behind his back and the other against the wall up over his head , spread his legs and searched his person .
I took a snapshot of this position with my cell phone :
You & the Police !
Kenneth W. Royce Best Price : $ 2.00 Buy New $ 61.09 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
As I stood there I could hear the police disciplining the young man on the error of his ways .
How when they say to jump his only option is to ask : how high ?
Of course , being in possession of a functioning frontal lobe , the young man insisted that he had done nothing wrong but the tax feeders did n’t care .
They simply kept repeating that he was told to do something and he did n’t and therefore evidently had forfeited his civil rights .
The Making of a Police ...
Lawrence , Steve Best Price : $ 18.39 Buy New $ 23.95 ( as of 01:45 EST - Details )
In the end the young man received a citation for J - walking , I kid you not , since he did n’t cross the street on the crosswalk .
Unfortunately , it would seem that J - walking in China Town in DC is tantamount to suspected armed robbery so please use those crosswalks .
Unfortunately , this particular incident also gave me yet another opportunity to observe the sheep like hypnotic stupor that most Americans seem to exist in .
While the young man was pinned up against the wall somebody walking by recognized him and asked him what was going on .
The young man explained the civil injustice taking place and pleaded that the acquaintance remain as a witness to what was taking place to which she replied : u201 Coh , you ’ll be okay , I ’m late for something , I ’ll see you at church on Sundayu201D !
I could just feel the attitude in the air that night .
Everyone witnessing this scene no doubt felt that this young man must have done something very bad , very wrong otherwise why would the police be chasing after him ?
No doubt they felt that if it had been them that they would have somehow deserved it because after all : the law is the law .
I remember growing up in the 70’s and 80’s , we were taught that everything to do with communism , especially Russia , was bad .
That communist countries were evil governments and evil empires which abused citizen ’s civil rights and might one day try to do the same to the U.S.
They represented everything that was bad in the world and the U.S. represented everything that was good and we must fight the evil for the sake our humanity .
Is my picture above really so different than this one of Russian police arresting peaceful civil rights protesters ?
Or this one from communist China :
Then why do people continue to see the U.S. through rose colored glasses ?
I just do n’t get it .
I guess that ’s why I drink .

The complexity of modern computing platforms has made it increasingly difficult to write numerical code that achieves the best possible performance .
Straightforward implementations based on algorithms that minimize the operations count often fall short in performance by an order of magnitude .
This tutorial introduces the reader to a set of general techniques to improve the performance of numerical code , focusing on optimizations for the computer 's memory hierarchy .
Two running examples are used to demonstrate these techniques : matrix - matrix multiplication and the discrete Fourier transform .

If you allow applications to save your passwords , anyone with physical access to your PC can decode them unless you 're properly encrypting them — and chances are pretty good you 're not .
Let 's walk through the right and wrong ways to store your passwords .

For the purpose of this article , we 'll assume that the people you allow into your house are trustworthy enough not to hack your passwords , and your laptop has been stolen instead — but the tips here should apply to either scenario .
Regardless of how you choose to save your passwords , you should make sure to use great passwords and even stronger answers for security questions .

Almost any application that requires you to login to something will also provide an option to save your password , and once you 've done that , your password may as well be plain text .
Behind the scenes , even if the application encrypts the account information , it 's doing so with a static key that can be easily deciphered through some reverse engineering , and somebody not only can , but already has created a utility to recover those passwords .

It does n't even matter all that much if you 've got a tough Windows password ; anybody with physical access to your PC can use an Ubuntu Live CD to copy all of your data onto an external drive without modifying anything , and crack your files on another machine whenever they please ( assuming you do n't have your entire hard drive encrypted ) .
If they had a little more time , they could use Ophcrack to figure out your password , or they could just be mean and use the System Rescue CD to change your Windows password .

Once that person has access to your files , they can recover your passwords with free tools easily — you can recover passwords in a few clicks from Outlook , Instant Messenger , Wi-Fi , Internet Explorer , Firefox , Chrome , or any number of other applications .
All it takes is a quick Google search to find even more cracking utilities .

Pidgin Stores Passwords in Plain Text

The decision to store the passwords in plain text is a deliberate one that 's been thoughtfully considered , and while you might initially think it 's a terribly insecure way to handle security , keep in mind that you can simply download any number of utilities like Nirsoft 's MessenPass and recover the passwords from AIM , Windows Live Messenger , Trillian , Miranda , Google Talk , Digsby , etc .
The Pidgin developers point out that their option is actually the preferred method for security :
Having our passwords in plaintext is more secure than obfuscating them precisely because , when a user is not misled by a false sense of security , he is likely to use the software in a more secure manner .
Advertisement
The best answer , of course , is to not allow your IM client to store your passwords at all — but if you must store them , you should at least use the built - in Windows encryption , if not a full - blown TrueCrypt setup .
Either option would be better than the pseudo - protection most other applications provide .

Password Managers Are the Only Secure Storage
Advertisement
The only truly secure way to store your passwords is to use a password manager to securely track your passwords , combined with a a great master password to protect the rest of your saved passwords — if you use an easy password for your password manager , it would be easy to crack with a brute force attack .
Do n't lure yourself into a false sense of security by just using one — your password manager password should be at least 10 alpha- numeric characters if you really want to be secure .

You 've got a number of great password managers to choose from , like reader favorite Keepass , a cross - platform tool which has many plugins that help you master your passwords and make using a password manager easier to deal with .
And , of course , let 's not forget that Firefox has a full password manager built right into the application .

Use a Firefox Master Password ( With More Than 8 Characters )
Advertisement
If you want to use Firefox to save the passwords for all your web accounts , you should make sure to enable a Firefox Master Password by heading into Tools –> Options –>
Security and checking the box for Use a master password .
Advertisement
Once you 've done this , Firefox will store all of your passwords with nearly unbreakable AES encryption — providing you use a password with more than 8 alpha-numeric characters and at least one capitalized letter .
If you used a weak and pathetic password like " secret " , it could be broken in a matter of minutes with a brute force cracking tool , but a decent 8 + random character password will take at least 73 years for a brute force attack .
Advertisement
Each time you start Firefox and go to a site that requires a saved password , you 'll be first prompted for your master password .
By default , the master password authentication will be active for the entire session , but you can use the Master Password Timeout extension to lock your master password again after a certain interval , which is handy if you walk away from your desk without remembering to lock it with Win+L .

Use TrueCrypt to Encrypt Everything
Advertisement
Rather than deal with password managers or whether or not to save your passwords , you could simply create a separate , encrypted TrueCrypt drive , and use portable versions of your applications to keep everything totally secure .
If you 're even more paranoid , you can use TrueCrypt to encrypt the entire hard drive — you will be prompted for a password every time you boot , but you can relax knowing that anything you do will be encrypted , even if you use scripts with your passwords stored in plain text .
If TrueCrypt is n't your thing , you can use the built - in encryption functionality in Windows — just keep in mind that if you change your password your data will be inaccessible , and your Windows password can be cracked , giving them full access to your files .

A 1960s car designer 's vision of the car of the future .
Today , the private car 's days are numbered .
With the economic recession and environmental crisis alternative plans for socially useful , sustainable production have never been more relevant argues Lars Henriksson .
When the financial shit hit the fan last year the overproduction in the auto industry became visible .
In the Swedish auto industry the proportions between fan and shit was especially problematic .
The crisis involved two of the world ’s smallest mass producers , both owned by troubled US corporations , and both producing large , fuel consuming semi-luxury cars .
In a country of 9 million it was like having two bankrupt car companies and their chain of sub contractors plus two crisis - hit truck companies in London .
The auto crisis of course became a big political issue in Sweden and still is .
As elsewhere in the world there were two principle lines of argument in the mainstream discussion about what should be done .
One line of argument supported “ creative destruction ” on the basis that the market had made its verdict and some of the corporations had been sentenced to death .
The market should not be tampered with as that would only make things worse .
A green variant on this was : ``Cars are damaging the climate .
We do n’t need them or the companies that make them .
It ’s good if the auto industry goes away . ''
The other main line of argument advocated support for the industry .
The government , it was said , must subsidise the companies to help them through these troubled times so that they can be ready to grow again when things get back to normal .
There should be loans , the scrapping of incentives , tax breaks and so on .
In Sweden this has been the line of the Social Democratic Party , the industry itself , many analysts and the unions .
The leaders of my union made their “ contribution ” by signing a contract that temporarily reduced members ’ pay and working time .
Both these approaches to the crisis are disastrous .
The fundamental assumption behind the “ support - the - industry ” position is false .
There will not be any “ back to normal ” , at least not an endlessly expanding production of cars .
` The time of the car is running out '
Road transport is responsible for about 20 % of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union ( EU ) , transport being the sector where emissions are increasing the fastest .
Even without the need to stop climate change the time of the car is running out .
The production of oil is going to peak in the near future and this cheap energy will no longer be available .
In fact a transport system based on mass auto transit is not an option at all .
And the industry ’s answer -- the ``green '' car , fuel efficient , running on renewable fuels -- is an illusion .
It is true that the average CO 2 emission per kilometre from new cars is going down , but while the period 1995 - 2002 saw a 13 % average decrease in fuel consumption for new cars in the EU countries there was a rise in total fuel consumption by 7 % because of more cars . [ 1 ]
Agrofuel is no solution .
For example in forest - rich Sweden , dimethyl ether ( DME ) synthetic diesel made from wood is presented as the future .
However , just to replace the consumption of oil by the present number of cars on the road with DME would take a total yearly yield of 6 billion hectares of forest .
Other types of alternative agrofuels proposed to replace the oil we burn , like ethanol , demand too much arable land and water .
Besides , producing ethanol from corn , or diesel from soy , directly conflicts with the production of food for the poorest people of the world .
What about the electrical car or the hydrogen engine ?
Neither hydrogen nor electricity is a source of energy .
Rather they are bearers of energy that require an energy input of some kind .
Today two thirds of the world ’s electricity is produced in coal fueled power plants .
All this means that the volume of transport , and especially of road transport , has to be adapted to a level that is sustainable in the long term .
And that would be the end of the auto industry as we know it .
Finally , the economic crisis that is far from over will reshape the auto industry dramatically .
Convert not destroy
The argument that says uncompetitive auto production should be allowed to go to the wall is actually the worst from a social , practical and political point of view .
In Sweden industries have come and gone .
In the 1960s when the textile industry moved out , and in the 1970s and 1980s when the same thing happened to the shipyards , other sectors grew .
These included the auto industry and especially public services .
This “ structural change ” was the official policy of the unions and the Social Democratic Party .
Today , however , no other industries are on the rise and the public sector is facing cutbacks .
In an auto - dependent economy like that of Sweden this will mean disaster .
Second , an industry like the car industry , is not a bunch of machines and buildings .
Most of all it is an organisation of people .
So when humanity is facing its toughest challenge so far – to change an economy and production that has been built on fossil energy for 250 years – we need all the resources we can use to do this .
It would be a completely irresponsible waste to destroy an industrial complex that has been built and developed over almost a century .
The car industry has an expertise in logistics , production engineering , designing for production and quality control that could be applied to any kind of production .
And efficient mass production is exactly what we need if we want to replace the fossil economy .
It makes complicated technical devices cheap and should be applied to production of wind turbines and other equipment for renewable energy production , and of trams , trains and other vehicles and systems for a sustainable transport system .
Car workers are also used to change and conversion .
In the last decades new models have been introduced at an absurd speed with the result that retooling , rebuilding and retraining , have become part of everyday life .
There are historical precedents for converting industries .
In the months after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor the US government prohibited the production of private cars and ordered the auto industry to change over to war production .
Ford and the other producers obeyed ( and earned many a good dollar ) by applying their knowledge of mass production to tanks and bombers .
The same thing happened in Britain .
To sum up : the auto industry is a fantastic and versatile operation that need not be tied to making cars .
It could play an important role in converting our societies into sustainable , carbon dioxide neutral , societies .
Alliance for jobs and the planet
But ultimately the climate question is not about technology .
It ’s about politics , that is , class struggle .
And that is where the workers of the threatened industry come in .
And this is where we , the workers of the threatened auto industry come in .
We must unite and fight for our jobs but it ’s a very hard fight and almost impossible to win so we have to turn to society at large for support and intervention .
We have to argue that the corporate leaders who now are begging the state for help have forfeited their right to run the auto industry .
The state should not subsidise their rule and continued destructive production but instead should nationalise the industry and convert it to create safe jobs and a production that can help us get out of the fossil economy .
This would be a platform for a broad social alliance , both to save both the jobs and the planet .
Is it possible to build this alliance -- to put forward demands for alternative production on the shop floor and upwards ?
If so , how ?
The first step is to build workers ’ self - confidence by learning to fight collectively for anything at all .
If we just talk about these grand schemes without engaging in everyday fights we will be seen as windbags building castles in the air .
A second step could be to produce concrete plans on how to convert different sectors .
In 1980 we had a referendum over nuclear power in Sweden and one of the most important things the environmental movement did was to put forward an Alternative Energy Plan showing in detail how nuclear power could be abolished and replaced with renewable energy .
This was a very important tool in the campaign , in educating activists and giving people in the movement self - confidence .
In May 2009 , environmentalists , citizen groups , researchers and union representatives from various European countries ( including Bob Crow of the RMT union in Britain ) met in Germany to discuss a sustainable transportation system .
The conference issued the Cologne Declaration against rail privatisation and for sustainable transport .
A concrete plan , RailEurope2025 , was put forward to transform European transport in 15 years in order to cut the CO 2 emissions by 75 % , thus cutting the total emissions by half .
This kind of plan could be used by unions and other movements to build political pressure .
The third and most important step would be to connect such alternative plans to the concrete workplaces , to production on a grassroots level , as was attempted in the 1970s in Britain at Lucas Aerospace .
Even though that fight was defeated it had repercussions trough out the world , and still has .
In the late 1970s there was a crisis in Sweden in shipbuilding , steel and the last remnants of the textile industry .
For a period “ alternative production ” became a hopeful buzzword , in quite broad layers .
But almost all attempts to save jobs under this banner failed because to almost everyone “ alternative production ” meant “ other profitable products ” .
The way we can use the idea of “ alternative production ” is to point out that we want to use our skills and can use it to produce socially useful and necessary products , regardless of whether they are profitable in the capitalist sense or not .
This was the strength of the Lucas Plan .
Another appealing aspect of the Lucas experience was that is showed what can happen when workers step outside the daily treadmill .
In the late 18th century Thomas Paine summed this up as follows :
Revolutions create genius and talent ; but these events do no more than bring them forward .
There is existing in man , a mass of sense lying in a dormant state , and which , unless something excites it to action , will descend with him , in that condition , to the grave . [ 2 ]
This year ’s Campaign against Climate Change trade union conference decided to form a committee to start the work for a plan for conversion , based on local participation .
This is a way forward .

This article is an extract from his speech at the Climate and Capitalism conference organised by Green Left and Socialist Resistance in London on September 12 , 2009 . ]
In today 's fast - paced , multitasking world , it 's easy to get hooked on technology that 's always online , delivering a steady stream of texts and tweets .
But some mental health experts fear that a growing technology addiction , perhaps accelerated by the popularity of smart phones and social networks , will lead to a breakdown of interpersonal relationships and an increase in attention deficit disorder .
" If our attention span constricts to the point where we can only take information in 140 - character sentences , then that does n't bode too well for our future , " said Dr. Elias Aboujaoude , director of Stanford University 's Impulse Control Disorders Clinic at Stanford University .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" The more we become used to just sound bites and tweets , " Aboujaoude said , " the less patient we will be with more complex , more meaningful information .
And I do think we might lose the ability to analyze things with any depth and nuance .
Like any skill , if you do n't use it , you lose it . "
Dr. John Ratey , an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School , uses the term " acquired attention deficit disorder " to describe the way technology is rewiring the modern brain .
He noted that reliance on even the simplest programs - such as a spell - checker in a word - processing program or a contact list that memorizes all your phone numbers for you - are short - circuiting the brain 's ability to process details .
" My favorite example is when I type the word ' tomorrow , ' " Ratey said .
" I know spell - check will get it right .
It would take 30 milliseconds for me to make sure in my mind .
But we depend on that ( spell - check ) .
Even when we take the time to write , we do n't have the patience to give that a consideration . "
To be sure , the digital revolution has increased productivity and opened vast new worlds of information and discourse .
Some mental health experts say there 's still not enough research to determine whether heavy use of computers , the Internet or video games is an unhealthy condition by itself or merely a symptom of recognized problems such as depression .
' This little appendage '
But experts such as Ratey and Aboujaoude say they are already seeing cases that go beyond addiction to the Internet , especially with the growing popularity of portable devices that make it harder to walk away from technology .
The signs are everywhere - college students texting as their professors lecture , pedestrians crossing the street with their heads down checking messages on a BlackBerry , and BART riders reaching furtively into their pockets thinking their iPhone has vibrated - even if it has n't .
One of the firms generating the biggest buzz in technology , Twitter , caters to short attention spans with its text messages of 140 characters or less .
Another new San Francisco company called Particle recently started Robo.to , which offers video updates no longer than four seconds .
Pop star Justin Timberlake is the lead investor .
" We are definitely an addicted society , " said Dr. Kimberly Young , the founder and director of the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery of Bradford , Pa. , and author of a series of books on Web addiction .
" EBay goes down for a day , and everybody has a fit .
It 's like this little appendage that people have . "
It even reaches into the bedroom .
In a September survey , 36 percent of the people ages 35 and younger said they often used Facebook or Twitter after having sex .
Men were twice as likely to tweet or post status updates after sex .
" It 's the new cigarette , " said Manish Rathi , co-founder of Retrevo.com , a Sunnyvale consumer electronics shopping site that commissioned the survey .
Separation anxiety
Software engineer Jeanine Swatton of Dublin said that when she goes to lunch or dinner with someone , she eats " fairly quickly " to get back to her computer and tends " to check my e-mail messages on my iPhone throughout the meal .
Luckily , my friends understand . "
Swatton , 37 , believes her attention span has shortened .
" If I do not have access to a computer , I will check my iPhone or will have a glass of wine to reduce the anxiety of being away from a computer , " she said .
Indeed , technology has elevated the ability to multitask to a higher level .
But a study published in August by researchers at Stanford University 's Communication Between Humans and Interactive Media Lab found multitaskers were more distracted by irrelevant details and did n't do as well as people who completed one job at a time .
Harvard 's Ratey , author of the new book " Spark : The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain , " said he fears today 's tech - savvy generation is evolving away from the " genetic roots " of humankind , which used to have time for deep contemplation about complex problems without " being bombarded from stimuli from the outside . "
" It 's a challenge for many kids just to sit silently for a few minutes without moving around , looking for some kind of stimulation , " he said .
" We need that ability to center ourselves . "
" A bigger portion are not learning to be more resilient , and we 're going to have a lot of kids who are just not used to the challenges of defeat , " he said .
" It 's just part of society that we 're multitasking all the time .
We can't stop to think , and if we have to stop and consider something , we get frustrated . "
Writing habits change
Aboujaoude , assistant director of the Stanford School of Medicine 's Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder Clinic , said a few studies indicate a link between excessive Internet use and attention - deficit - hyperactivity disorder in children and some adults , which could impair academic performance and social development .
The Internet , though , is only part of " one big virtual addiction , " he said .
" One reason that ADD is on the rise is that our attention span is similar to our attention span on Facebook , " Aboujaoude said .
" Look at language .
People are writing the way that they text .
Anything complex that takes several paragraphs to develop is information overload at this point .
" I think of it as regressive .
I do n't think of it as progressive .
It 's becoming so normalized in our culture , it becomes hard to catch while it 's happening . "

Когда имбирь противопоказа н
У имбиря есть не только полезные , но и вредные его свойства , с которыми приходится считаться любителям экзотического продукта .
Болезни органов пищеварения : стоит ли рисковат ь
Имбирь – уникальный продукт , который при одних и тех же болезнях может иметь столько же противопоказаний , сколько и показаний .
Так , о пользе его при заболеваниях пищеварительного тракта сказано и написано очень много .
Он стимулирует обменные процессы , устраняет диарею и метеоризм , снимает спазмы желудка .
Но при этом имбирь опасен тем , что чрезмерное увлечение им может буквально обжечь слизистую желудка и стать причиной язвы .
Печень особенно уязвим а
Хронические заболевания печени – серьезный повод отказаться от употребления имбиря в любом виде – порошка , тертого корня или чая .
Причина в том , что пряность усиливает секреторную функцию органа , а это крайне неблагоприятно для раздраженной или воспаленной печени .
Также при наличии камней в желчном пузыре желчегонные свойства имбиря могут оказать плохую услугу , вызвав неконтролируемое движений камней по желчным протокам .
С осторожностью следует употреблять продукт как в виде пищевой пряности , так и имбирного чая , столь любимого многими .
Действие имбиря на сердечно - сосудистую систем у
Здесь тоже не обходится без противоречий .
С одной стороны , имбирь очень полезен : он укрепляет сердечную мышцу , способствует разжижению крови , улучшает мозговое кровообращение , повышает общий тонус организма .
С другой стороны , он повышает артериальное давление , и может спровоцировать инсульт или инфаркт .
Категорически противопоказан имбирь при стенокардии и ишемической болезни сердца .
Простуда и имбир ь
Казалось бы , это именно та область , где не может быть разночтений .
Имбирь широко известен как противопростудное средство .
Чай с добавлением тертого корня имбиря – прекрасное согревающее , сосудорасширяющее и противовирусное средство .
Но – только при болезнях , протекающих без осложнений и высокой температуры .
Если же температура есть , имбирь может повысить ее еще больше , а при гриппе с жаром может вызвать кровоизлияние в мозг .
Нужны ли пряности беременным ?
Почему бы и нет ?
В начале беременности умеренное употребление имбиря оказывает общее тонизирующее действие , снимает тошноту и головокружение при ранних токсикозах .
Зато во второй половине беременности он может быть опасен , так как вызывает повышение артериального давления , что крайне нежелательно и для матери , и для плода .
Исключить имбирь из своего рациона следует и кормящим матерям – зачем ребенку перевозбуждаться и маяться бессонницей ?
С чем нельзя сочетать имбир ь
При приеме лекарственных средств имбирь следует употреблять с опаской .
По крайней мере , в тех случаях , когда его прямое действие может усилить или купировать действие препарата .
Так , нельзя принимать его вместе с лекарствами от гипертонии и аритмии , потому что обратное действие имбиря ослабит эффект от препарата .
Нельзя употреблять имбирь во время приема сахароснижающих средств , а также средств для понижения свертываемости крови .
Взаимодействие имбиря с лекарствам и
Имбирь способен повышать силу антидиабетических лекарств .
Способен повышать силу противосвертывающих средств ( агонист простациклина ) .
Возможно увеличение воздействия сердечных лекарств .
Снижает действие лекарств , блокирующих бета -адренорецепторы .
Противодействует или взаимодействует антиаритмическим лекарствам , повышает риск гипокалиемии ;
Увеличивает риск аритмии , взаимодействуя с деполяризующими мышечными релаксантами ;
Может понижать действие гипотензивных лекарств и при объединении с симпатомиметиками повышается вероятность артериальной гипертензии .
Противодействует нитратам и средствам , блокирующим кальциевый канал .
Когда имбирь не подходи т
Каждый человек по - своему реагирует на передозировку , а то и полное неприятие продукта .
К слову , если после добавления пряности в пищу , или после ароматного имбирного чая на коже проявилась аллергическая реакция в виде покраснения или сыпи – это явный признак того , что имбирь следует исключить из рациона .
Нарушение сна – еще один довод против него .
Что касается действия имбиря на нервную систему , здесь тоже не все однозначно .
Если после неумеренного употребления пряности или чая появляется заторможенность или , напротив , перевозбуждение – это признаки передозировки .
Подобные опыты могут привести к сбою в работе сердечно - сосудистой системы .
По большому счету , польза и вред имбиря , как и любого продукта , связаны лишь с правильным и умеренным употреблением , за исключением случаев индивидуальной непереносимости .
Важно соблюдать меру – и тогда риск навредить своему здоровью будет минимален .

Маринованный имбир ь
Иногда хочется совместить несовместимое – лед и пламень , черное и белое , острое и сладкое … стоп , в последнем нет ничего невозможного , потому что есть на свете такой красавец овощ – имбирь .
Растет он в странах Юго - Восточной Азии , но , однажды проникнув в Европу , уже не покидал ее пределов .
За что мы его любим ?
Итак , острый и в то же время сладкий корень самых причудливых форм знаменит тем , что ему отдают второе место после женьшеня по полезным свойствам , содержанию витаминов и микроэлементов .
Употребляют его в любом виде – в сыром , в сушеном , измельченном в порошок , маринованном .
Но – есть одно « но » .
В сыром или сушеном виде имбирь можно съесть в очень небольшом количестве , разве что в виде пикантной приправы или заваренным в чае .
Понятно , что в таких дозах и пользы от него будет меньше .
Гораздо эффективнее маринованный имбирь .
Преимущества маринованного имбиря :
минимальная термическая обработка позволяет сохранять все витамины , минералы и аминокислоты , необходимые организму , помогающие пищеварению , стимулирующие обменные процессы , повышающие иммунитет ;
хранить готовый продукт можно в холодильнике от трех до шести месяцев , в стеклянной или фарфоровой банке с плотной крышкой ;
маринованный имбирь месяцами сохраняется свою полезность , пряный вкус и аромат , зато слегка смягчается жгучесть .
Многие воспринимают имбирь лишь в качестве дополнения к суши .
Это правильно , потому что в
Японии суши подают непременно с имбирем , да и вообще это неотъемлемый атрибут японской кухни .
Что вовсе не означает , что его нельзя употреблять у нас и в другой интерпретации .
Маринованный имбирь прекрасно сочетается со всеми рыбными и мясными блюдами .
Приходится признать , что для многих этот продукт все еще остается экзотикой .
Зато те , кто успел с ним познакомиться , никогда уже от него не отказываются .
Потому все больше интересующихся способами использования , хранения и маринования , а также видами маринованного имбиря .
С этого и начнем .
Два вида маринованного имбир я
Наиболее известны два вида маринованного имбиря – гари и бени - сёга .
Они заготавливаются разными способами , и употребляются , кстати , тоже по -разному .
Гари
это тонкие ломтики молодых корней нежно - розового цвета , которые обычно подают к суши ;
это скорее не ингредиент блюда , а « закуска для перебивки вкуса » .
( Примерн о так в парфюмерных магазинах ставят зерна кофе , чтобы перебить предыдущий аромат и пробовать следующий ) .
Бени-сёга
никогда не подается к суши , им дополняют другие блюда – мясо , лапшу .
В данном случае он выполняет ту же роль , что в нашей кухне – овощи и соленья ;
придает блюдам пикантный острый привкус , при этом положительно воздействуя на организм ;
для этого вида маринуют не молодые , а зрелые прошлогодние корнеплоды с волокнистой структурой .
Попробуем сделать сам и
Кажется , в смысле пользы и вкусовых качеств маринованный имбирь уже не вызывает сомнений .
Теперь самое время полюбопытствовать , как его , собственно говоря , мариновать ?
Можно пойти простым путем и купить готовый продукт в супермаркете .
Но в таком случае есть риск ошибиться и получить совсем не то , что хотелось бы .
К примеру , как отличить гари для суши от бени - сёга для прочих блюд , если во всех баночках видишь тонко нарезанный заморский овощ одинаково розоватого цвета ?
Изучить ингредиенты ?
Но надписи на этикетке обычно на японском языке , а русский перевод на маленькой наклейке написан таким мелким шрифтом , что и в очках не прочтешь .
Да и что мы , честно говоря , знаем об этих самых ингредиентах и консервантах ?
Кстати , нежно - розовый цвет может быть результатом добавления красителей .
Значит …
Значит , нужно потрудиться и заготовить любимый продукт своими руками .
Для начала – выбрать правильный имбирь .
Он должен быть чистым , равномерного светло - бежевого цвета , без всяких вмятин , черных точек и тем более плесени между сплетенными корешками .
Перед маринованием корнеплоды нужно тщательно вымыть и очистить от кожуры .
Срезать нужно очень тонкий слой , так как именно под кожурой сосредоточено много полезных веществ .
Лучше всего воспользоваться овощечисткой .
Кстати , ею же можно настругать тончайшие ломтики , но это на любителя .
Кто -то предпочитает шинковку .
А дальше каждый может выбрать свой способ .
Вот несколько рецептов , как приготовить маринованный имбирь .
Простой рецепт маринованного имбир я
Простейший способ – залить ломтики рисовым ( в идеале ) или сливовым ( умезу ) уксусом и добавить по вкусу соль и сахар .
За неимением можно использовать винный или бальзамический уксус , который в наших магазинах встречается чаще .
Аромат и вкус конечного продукта будет не менее изысканным , Кто -то добавляет в маринад немного саке или красного вина .
Это способ , что называется , на глаз .
Рецепт маринованного имбиря гар и
Другой вариант : Тонко нарезанные ломтики молодого имбиря слегка посолить и выдержать примерно час .
Выложить на бумажное полотенце и старательно промокнуть .
Сложить слоями в чистую банку .
В уксус добавить сахар , довести до кипения и залить этим маринадом имбирь .
Когда остынет , поставить банку в холодильник .
Ломтики уже порозовели и готовы к употреблению .
Стоит заметить , что именно так чаще всего маринуют имбирь гари .
Ингредиенты :
0,5 кг молодых корнеплодов ;
100 мл 3 % рисового ( или бальзамического ) уксуса ;
50 г сахара ;
1 чайная ложка соли .
Маринад можно и не кипятить , а просто смешать и залить им имбирь .
Конечно , этот способ займет больше времени – одну - две недели , зато ломтики сохранят свежесть и плотность .
А для цвета можно добавить ложку сухого красного вина .
Быстрый рецепт маринованного имбиря ( беги-сёга )
Если все же хочется получить маринованный имбирь побыстрее , прямо к праздничному столу – есть такой рецепт :
200 г корнеплодов ;
1 стакан 3 % рисового уксуса ;
2 чайные ложки соли ;
2 столовые ложки сахара .
Маринад нагреть , не доводя до кипения .
Для получения цвета можно добавить в него немного красного вина и кусочек свеклы .
Имбирь залить горячим маринадом , остудить – и все , вкуснейший к любому угощению готов .
Стоит заметить , что в данном случае мы получаем уже беги - сёга .
Способов маринования имбиря достаточно много , притом каждый привносит в рецепт что - то от себя .
Кто - то не доверяет другим способам и варит имбирь в маринаде целых полчаса – разумеется , при этом продукт размягчается и теряет жесткий вкус .
Зато есть гарантия , что продукт простерилизован до основания , хотя и в ущерб ценному составу .
Маринованный имбирь с водко й
Некоторые гурманы научились добавлять в маринад водку .
Точнее , смесь водки , вина и уксуса из расчета :
30 г водки ;
50 г красного вина ;
200 г 3 % рисового уксуса ;
4 ст. л. сахара .
Очищенный корень целиком бланшировать 2 минуты , затем нарезать ломтиками и уложить в емкость .
Водку , вино и сахар вскипятить , долить уксус , залить этим маринадом имбирь и накрыть крышкой .
После охлаждения – в холодильник .
Буквально через пару часов имбирь приобретает приятный розовый оттенок , а через три дня его можно подавать к столу .
Не только для японце в
Имбирь ассоциируется с суши , а значит , с Японией .
Однако и у нас его оценили по достоинству , и не только потому , что суши не успели распробовать только дети и закоренелые скептики .
Маринованный имбирь с успехом дополняет привычные для нас блюда из мяса и рыбы .
И потому никому не возбраняется экспериментировать с вариантами использования и приготовления чудесного продукта .
Главное , что это вкусно и полезно .
Приятного аппетита !
Ботаническое описание имбир я
Имбирь ( Zingiber ) – род многолетних травянистых растений из семейства Имбирных ( Zingiberaceae ) .
Предполагают , что латинское название « Zingiber » переводится с санскрита как « рогатый корень » .
Родиной имбиря является Западная Индия и Юго -Восточная Азия .
В природе , в диком виде не произрастает .
Его возделывают в субтропических и тропических района х Японии , Китая , Западной Африки , Вьетнама , Бразилии , Индии , Аргентины , Ямайки .
А также выращивают как садовое растение , или в комнатных условиях – в обычных горшках или ящиках .
Имбирь имеет прямостоящие , камышеобразные , округлые стебли , достигающие в высоту до 1 - 1,5 м. Цветочные стебли чешуйчатые .
Листья ланцетовидные , цельнокрайние , очередные , с заострённой верхушкой .
Цветки оранжево - желтые или коричневые , собраны в виде колосовидных соцветий .
Плод – трёхстворчатая коробочка .
Корневища имеют вид мясистых кругловатых пальчаторазделенных кусочков и формируют мочковатую корневую систему .
Имбирь произрастает в теплом и влажном климате , как правило , на высоте до 1500 м над уровнем моря и способен расти при самых разных агроклиматических условиях .
Лучшей почвой для выращивания является рыхлый суглинок , который содержит большое количество гумуса .
Имбирь размножается корневищами , для этого корни делят на небольшие кусочки с « глазками » ( по 2,5 - 5 см ) .
Высаживают с марта по апрель .
Выкапывают , в зависимости от климатических условий , через 6 - 10 месяцев , когда листочки начинают желтеть и опадать .
Различают две формы корней – белый имбирь и черный .
Черный имбирь просто ошпаривают кипятком , при этом , не очищая корни от кожуры , а для получения белого имбиря корни очищают при помощи щетки и протираю т
2 %-м раствором сернистой кислотой или хлорной извести в течение 6 ч после снятия с корневища кожуры .
Бывает что почищенные корни после мытья и сушки натирают мелом .
Черный имбирь ( «барбадосский » ) обладает более сильным запахом и жгучим вкусом в сравнении с белым ( «бенгальским » ) имбирем , поскольку при обработке определенная часть душистых веществ теряется .
Оба вида сушат на солнце .
Излом имбиря светло - жёлтого цвета , не зависимо от вида .
Молодые корневища почти белые ; но со временем , чем старше становится корень , тем больше он желтеет на изломе .
Вкус имбиря сладкий и острый .
В длину высушенный корень может достигать 12 см , а в толщину – 2 см .
Выход готового , сухого продукта составляет 15 - 25 % от сырой массы .
Химический соста в
Имбирь содержит множество полезных веществ , основными из них являются : аспарагин , алюминий , кальций , каприловая кислота , хром , холин , жиры , волокно , железо , германий , линолиевая кислота , марганец , магний , олеиновая кислота , никотиновая кислота , фосфор , кремний , калий , натрий , витамин С .
В 100 г измельченного корня имбиря содержится :
Питательные вещества ( г ) : Минеральные вещества ( мг ) : Витамины ( мг ) : Белки – 9,2 Mg ( магний ) – 184 C ( аскорбиновая кислота ) – 12 Жиры – 5,9 F ( фосфор ) – 148 B 1 ( тиамина гидрохлорид ) – 0,046 Углеводы – 70,9 Ca ( кальций ) – 116 B 2 ( рибофлавина-мононуклеотид ) – 0,19 Клетчатка – 5,9 Na ( натрий ) – 32 B 3 ( ниацин , никотиновая кислота ) – 5,2 Fe ( железо ) – 11,52 A ( ретинола ацетат ) – 0,015 Zn ( цинк ) – 4,73 K ( калий ) – 1,34
Особый терпкий и пряный аромат имбирного корня ощущается из - за содержания в нем 1 - 3 % эфирного масла , которое сосредоточено преимущественно в корневище .
Его основные компоненты : цингиберен ( зингиберен ) – до 70 % , крахмал – 4 % , гингерол – 1,5 % , камфен , линалоол , гингерин , фелландрен , бисаболен , борнеол , цитраль , цинеол , сахар и жир .

Также имбирь содержит все незаменимые аминокислоты , включая треонин , триптофан , лейзин , фениланин , метионин , валин и другие .
Используемые части растени я
В качестве пряности в приготовлении пищи , а также как лечебное средство в народной медицине используют корень имбиря .
В продаже можно найти множество видов корня имбиря : в молотом виде или в виде кусков корневищ , облитый шоколадом или засахаренный , в виде экстракта для имбирного пива .
Имбирь прекрасно сочетается с другими пряностями и входит в состав смесей " карри " .
Его добавляют в высшие сорта легкого пива .
Обычно имбирь встречается в молотом виде .
Молотый имбирный корень выглядит как серовато - жёлтый мучнистый порошок .
Хранить его нужно в герметичной упаковке .
В медицине применяется : очищенный сухой корень в виде порошка ( 250 - 500 мг ) , отвара или настоя , в гомеопатии используется настойка высушенного корня .
“ Greece is bankrupt , ” Roubini told CNBC.com at WEF .
“ Look , they have to ask China to help them out . ”
Greece is trying to get trying to entice China to buy 25 billion euros ( $ 35 billion ) in bonds , according to published reports Wednesday .
If the situation becomes dire enough the European Union will be forced to help bail Greece out because it ’s such a threat to the monetary union , he said .
( The discussion came as Roubini tried to warm up after an hour on the CNBC set .
The temperature as - 20 Celsius at the start of the show , and Dr. Doom was trying his best to recalibrate with hot tea and warming his stockinged feet at a space heater ) .
Not everyone is going with the pessimism .
According to one participant , Dr. Doom needs to know when to stop with the Gloom .
And there were big difference in the view of Roubini and Lloyd ’s Chairman Lord Levene .
Looking at banking regulation , it is not just enough to take proprietary trading and hedge fund activity away , there needs to be a return to the separation of commercial and investment banks , Roubini said .
But Lord Levene said that Sarbanes - Oxley regulation did n’t change the shape of the world and that regulation in “ blanket form ” can drive the problem away to somewhere else .

Here are some suggested things to say if you want to sound like an idiot when you talk about social media :
• It 's inconsequential – most of the verbiage on Twitter , Facebook and the like is banal blather
Yes , it certainly is .
The reason for that is that most of it is " social grooming " – messages passed between friends and family members as a way of maintaining social cohesion .
The meaning of the messages is n't " u look h4wt dude " or " wat up wiv you dawg ? "
That 's merely the form .
The meaning is : " I am thinking of you , I care about you , I hope you are well . "
I do n't call my parents in Canada and recount the latest additions to my daughter 's vocabulary because they need to know that the kid can say " elephant " and " potty " now ; I call them up to say , " all is well with your son and his family " , and " you are in my heart " , and " I love you " .
Criticizing the " banality " of Facebook conversation is as trite and ignorant as criticising people who talk about the weather .
There 's a reason we say " Did you sleep well ? " at breakfast and " How was your weekend ? " when we turn up to the office on Monday ( and it 's not that we care about the weekend or the rest ) .
Yes , people sometimes say consequential things on social media .
The Twitter tag # what Twitterdidforme has lots of sterling examples .
But these are rare events that are not Twitter 's raison d'etre .
People do n't join
Twitter because they hope that someday they 'll be sprung from jail , land a job , or reunite with a long - lost friend .
These are bonuses .
The real value of Twitter et al is to keep the invisible lines of connection between us alive .
• It is ugly – MySpace is a graphic designer 's worst nightmare
The word you 're looking for is n't " ugly " , it 's " vernacular " .
Graphic designers are paid to clearly communicate messages ( both covert and overt ) to strangers on behalf of clients .
Kids who bling out their MySpace pages do so because they are exuberant and playful .
These pages are as deliberately ugly as the photocopied punk band - posters that graced every telephone pole and building - site hoarding a generation ago .
The kids who make " ugly " MySpace pages are hardly ignorant of the visual vocabulary of professional design .
On the contrary , they have been saturated with professional design since birth , and can recognise a message crafted by a designer on behalf of a client at 100 yards – and what 's more , they can distinguish it from a page crafted by a peer at the same distance .
These pages are made by people who know – to the femtometre – exactly how ugly they are .
They are supposed to offend your sensibilities .
They are intended to make designers weep .
Their ugliness is a defence mechanism that protects them from being knocked off by marketing / communications firms , because most designers would rather break their own fingers than commit such an atrocity .
Prediction : in five years , some of these kids will have grown up , graduated from design college , and will be industriously turning out clones that authentically reproduce the exuberant no -design every bit as well as today 's high - street shops do Sex Pistols chic .
• It is ephemeral – Facebook will blow over in a year and something else will be along
Totally correct , but this is a feature , not a bug .
The technology that underpins social media is changing fast , and social media companies ' bone - deep intuitions about what it should and should n't do are made obsolete every 18 months or so .
Most of these companies wo n't be able to adapt .
They will die , and be replaced by a new generation of social media companies who have better , more contemporary sensibilities .
Only ancient , clueless dinosaurs like Rupert Murdoch are dumb enough to pay hundreds of millions for social media companies with the belief that they will grow to be immortal giants .
Only lazy , fat media execs from firms that endured for decades without having to remake themselves from top to bottom think that a complete turnover in the corporate landscape is a failure .
There are plenty of things to worry about when it comes to social media .
They are Skinner boxes designed to condition us to undervalue our privacy and to disclose personal information .
They have opaque governance structures .
They are walled gardens that violate the innovative spirit of the internet .
But to deride them for being social , experimental and personal is to sound like a total fool .
As we sit here today , Wall Street continues to exploit a policy of government - sponsored giveaways and secrecy to pay themselves billions .
Record - setting bonuses due to banks like Goldman Sachs as early next week .
Yet instead of acting as our cop , Secretary Tim Geithner has become central to what may be a cover - up of the greatest theft in U.S. history .
Here is the evidence .
COUNT 1 : The AIG Emails :
Recently - released emails show Geithner 's New York Federal Reserve Bank directing AIG to keep details of the 100 - cents - on - the - dollar bailout secret in 2008 -- A reversal of the traditional role of government , which is to force companies to become more transparent , not less .
A Treasury Spokeswoman says : " Secretary Geithner played no role in these decisions and indeed , by November 24 , he was recused from working on issues involving specific companies , including AIG . "
Friday , the White House also defended the Treasury Secretary :
Gibbs :
These decisions did not rise to his level at the fed .
CNN's Ed Henry :
How do you know that he was n't involved ?
He was the leader of the New York Fed .
Gibbs : Right , but he was n't on the emails that have been talked about and was n't party to the decision that was being made .
He was n't party to a decision to hide $ 62 billion dollar payouts to firms that became insolvent during his 5 - year watch at the New York Fed ?
Congressman Darrell Issa speculates that maybe Geithner was n't on the emails in question because his people felt so strongly they already knew their boss 's intentions , they did n't feel the need to bother him with the details .
COUNT 2 : He was n't even a regulator !
In Geithner 's own words during confirmation hearings in March :
" First of all , I 've never been a regulator ... I 'm not a regulator . "
According to the New York fed bank 's website , that was your job !!
And I quote from the Fed 's website : " As part of our core mission , we supervise and regulate financial institutions in the Second District . "
That district of course is the epicenter for bailed out banks and billion dollar bonuses .
Count 3 : " The Christmas Eve Taxpayer Massacre . "
As you were wrapping those last presents , Geithner 's Treasury Department lifted the 400 - billion dollar cap on taxpayer responsibility for potential losses for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The new cap ?
Unlimited taxpayer funds !
Interesting timing ...
Christmas eve , Tim ?
Still no word on recovering the hundreds of millions paid to the CEOs who created this mess .
COUNT 4 : He 's too cozy with certain banks .
Remember those call logs when he first started ... 80 contacts with Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , and CitiGroup CEOs in just 7 months !
But Bank of America 's CEO only got three calls .
Apparently Bank of America is not one of Geithner 's favorites , especially when you consider that there are still many unanswered questions about Tim Geithner 's role in threatening to fire Bank of America management if they did n't go through with a deal to buy Merrill lynch .
COUNT 5 : TARP Special Investigator Neil Barofsky 's report says Geithner 's New York Fed overpaid the big banks through AIG by billions of dollars .
Geithner says it had to be done .
Maybe so , maybe not , but this takes us to our final point .
Since then , the Treasury Secretary has yet to really prove whose side he's on -- the Wall Street big wigs or the American taxpayer ?
Here 's the litmus test : Mr. Geithner , show us the past ten years of AIG emails or step down so that we can get somebody who will .
A crime has been committed against the American taxpayer and right now you are standing at the door of the crime scene refusing to let anyone in .
Show us you 're not involved Mr. Geithner , prove the White House correct in defending you .
All we are asking for is the transparency promised by the President you serve .

Iraqi Politics and Zombies
My FP.com colleague Dan Drezner has created something of a cottage industry around " International Relations Theory and Zombies . "
Well now Iraq has offered up an empirical case study for him — in Iraq , where the Parliament ’s Accountability and Justice ( nee de-Baathification ) committee rose up from its grave and shambled forth seeking brains to devour .
Call it " Iraqi Political Accommodation … and Zombies . "
The story , of course , is the Committee ’s surprising decision to disqualify some 500 politicians , including the Sunni leader Saleh al - Mutlak and the current Minister of Defense Abdul - Qadir Jassem al - Obeidi , from contesting the upcoming Parliamentary elections on the grounds of alleged Baathist ties .
The Higher Election Commission disappointed many observers by accepting the recommendation ; the issue now goes to appeal .
Mutlak ’s list — which includes such figures as former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and current Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi — is talking about boycotting the election , which many fear could have a major negative impact on the elections and on longer - term prospects for Iraqi political accommodation .
Not bad work for a zombie !
I say that it ’s the work of a " zombie " because the Accountability and Justice Committee , a relic of the Bremer era rooted in the conceptually flawed and badly politicized De-Baathification Commission , should be dead .
It is basically continuing to operate because the early 2008 legislation establishing its replacement never got off the ground , so the old team just stayed in place .
It ’s most unfortunate that such a relic has thrown more fuel onto the fire of mistrust and institutional dysfunction … but hardly a surprise in the thinly institutionalized and still deeply polarized and hotly politicized Iraqi scene .
How significant is all this ?
I do n’t think that it shows a military " unraveling " as chronicled in Tom Rick ’s eponymous never - ending series , but rather the political problems which the " surge " never really resolved .
And those go deep , and should not be a surprise .
Major political legislation intended to overcome sectarian and institutional complaints has been stalled or ineffective .
Crucial Arab - Kurd issues remain unresolved .
Tensions between centralizers and federalists remain unresolved .
The Awakenings remain largely unintegrated into the state .
Last year ’s provincial elections generated excitement at the time and some political fluidity but have had only a limited impact on the wider environment and many of the new councils have proven disappointing .
The Iraqi refugees and internally displaced remain a persistent , gaping hole in the state .
Now the upcoming elections , along with the occasional bursts of horrific violence and rumours of coup attempts and foiled plots of various kinds , has generated a feverish political environment and ramped up uncertainty about the future ….
which this move only feeds .
That said , even if the ban on Mutlak and the others stands , I doubt it will lead to an across the board 2005 - style Sunni boycott .
Iraqi Sunni politics remain intensely fragmented and wracked by internal competition , as they have been for years .
The same fragmentation and divisions which make it difficult for the Sunnis either to form a workable electoral coalition or to rekindle the insurgency will probably make it impossible for them to coordinate or enforce a " Sunni " boycott .
Mutlak ’s list has plenty of ambitious Sunni rivals who will be only too happy to take advantage of its boycott to grab some extra power for themselves .
The whole situation may , however , help to drive down Sunni turnout in the elections and further distance them from the Iraqi political system .
The disqualifications come on top of all those long - running complaints mentioned above .
Parliamentary elections in which Sunni turnout is depressed , leading candidates have been disqualified on what appear to be sectarian grounds , and the final results do not significantly change the quality or quantity of Sunni representation will probably lead to even more dissatisfaction .
The real significance of the electoral ban is not that it is likely to retrigger a sectarian war or lead to apocalyptic outcomes .
It ’s more a manifestation of ongoing , lingering problems that continue to erode confidence in the emerging Iraqi state and erode the legitimacy of the evolving political system .
It certainly does n’t mean that the U.S. should rethink its commitment to drawing down its military forces there , as some will likely suggest .
Indeed , the American commitment to withdraw did help to focus Iraqi minds , and some progress has been made on key issues — though clearly not enough .
These Iraqi problems have persisted and evolved despite the ongoing presence of large numbers of U.S. troops , and keeping them there longer would n’t do any more to solve them .
It would also infuriate Iraqi public opinion , and violate the SOFA agreement .
The U.S. should remain politically engaged and supportive but military force levels really are n’t the issue .
Meanwhile , about those zombies ….
Coverage .py v3.2 is done .
Branch coverage works great , and the HTML report now has clickable columns ( thanks to Chris Adams ) , as well as other improvements .
Enjoy .
Seventeen miles south of Bath and a half - hour drive from Glastonbury , the Somerset town of Frome is one of those English settlements that rather suggests the country in microcosm .
Bits of the townscape have a pinched , austere aspect , though close by there are cafes and clothes shops brimming with chichi affluence – walking around the place , you occasionally get the sense that you can traverse the entire social spectrum in less than 50 yards .
The town forms the core of the constituency of Somerton and Frome – number 11 on the Conservatives ' target list , and currently held by the Liberal Democrats with a majority of 812 .
On a swing of only 0.56 % , it would fall to the Tories and be represented by a new MP : 30 - year - old Annunziata Rees - Mogg , daughter of the life peer and establishment mainstay William Rees - Mogg and sister of the Eton - educated Jacob , who just happens to be favourite to win the neighbouring seat of North East Somerset .
Thus far , Rees - Mogg has crashed into the national headlines only once : last week , when , with the rising noise of class warfare coming from Westminster , there were reports of David Cameron bemoaning the number of Conservative candidates with double - barrelled surnames , and suggesting – as a joke , his people later claimed – she change her name to the altogether more approachable " Nancy Mogg " .
Frome , then , seems an appropriate setting for a thoroughly non-scientific exercise : trudging the streets with an A4 picture of Cameron , and attempting to find out what people make of our probable next prime minister .
Who is he ?
What words does he bring to mind ?
And what might he do with all that power ?
" He 's like the young Tony Blair , " says 34 - year - old Sean Kirtley , whom I grab as he leaves a kitchen shop with his young daughter .
" Politicians are all very smooth these days , are n't they ?
Would I vote for him ?
I have n't made my mind up .
But he 's obviously talented .
And he 's got more charisma than the man in power at the moment . "
Over the next hour or so , I make my way through the uncertain tangle of feelings that will decide the next election .
People talk about Cameron as an assured , on - the - up kind of figure – and routinely contrast his skills with a sitting prime minister who , true to recent reports , prompts a kind of sad sympathy .
The more malign stuff I hear about the Tory leader includes " no substance " , " too much of an opportunist " , and " he 's trying to get across that he's the common man , but he is n't " .
Those with a more positive opinion mention his credentials as a " family man " , his air of winning confidence – and I have no great difficulty finding people who think he should soon be in 10 Downing Street .
" I hope he gets in , " says a thirtysomething mother who talks for England but wo n't give me her name .
She says she voted Liberal Democrat in 2005 , but having opted for the Tories in the past , she 's now going to revive the habit .
" He comes across as an honest family man .
I work in education , and I hope he 'll make some changes .
I think education 's underfunded , but I also think there 's far too much bureaucracy and paper - pushing .
I know we 're in massive debt , and he 's probably going to put taxes up .
I do n't want to pay more tax , but I 'd rather pay tax that 's well spent .
At the moment , it is n't . "
At the top of the cobbled Catherine Hill , however , I get a rather more swingeing verdict .
The Little Red Cafe is the kind of small business that would surely cause your average Cameroon to swoon – all beautiful coffee , home - made cakes and retro-look fittings – but Liz Andrew , the co-proprietor , may not be their easiest quarry .
Her answers , in fact , would gladden those Labour politicians who are currently trying to portray Cameron as Lord Snooty - gone - Thatcherite .
" What do I think ? " she wonders , half - glaring at Cameron 's portrait .
" Slimeball .
He represents the kind of smarmy upper - middle - classness I do n't like , really .
I 've never been a fan .
I would n't put my trust in him , put it that way . "
I wonder : can she think of one story that sums up what puts her off ?
" Probably the cycling to work thing , " she says .
" You know , with his limo driver behind him . "
As is now a Westminster cliche , the occasion in spring 2006 when the Daily Mirror caught Cameron cycling to work while his chauffeur brought up the rear with that day 's paperwork has long been established as one of his biggest mistakes .
More than three years on , it still haunts him , and the fact that it is fixed in some people 's minds as a byword for chicanery and insincerity crystallises another modern political commonplace : the Tory leader 's supposed failure to " seal the deal " .
November was not exactly a glorious month for the Tories .
First , Cameron bowed to the inevitable and binned his supposedly " cast- iron guarantee " of a referendum on the Lisbon treaty – to howls of protest from the Eurosceptic right .
At around the same time , some voices suggested that the Sun 's shrill noises - off about Gordon Brown 's letter to the mother of a dead Afghanistan veteran had tainted the Tories by association .
There were also ongoing mutterings about how the new Conservative emphasis on cuts and austerity was backfiring , those revelations about Zac Goldsmith 's non-dom status , and Labour 's attacks on Tory plans to effectively raise the threshold of inheritance tax to a cool £ 2 m .
Small wonder , perhaps , that seven of last month 's 10 British opinion polls gave the Conservatives less than 40 % – the figure they need if they 're to achieve a majority of Westminster seats .
Two weeks ago , moreover , the Observer ran an Ipsos MORI poll that put only six points between Labour and the Tories , and it all went off : endless media chatter about the rising chances of a hung parliament , and the possible dashing of all kinds of Conservative hopes .
And so to the big question .
In the summer of last year , when Brown 's woes over the abolition of the 10 p tax rate fed into Tory poll leads of more than 20 percentage points , the great Conservative dream of a Blair - esque landslide seemed within their reach .
Why has that prospect now seemingly disappeared ?
When I speak to Ipsos MORI 's chief executive , Ben Page , he says he was surprised by their last poll , and is at pains to remind me of Cameron 's enviable personal approval ratings – but eventually he explains some of what might be eating away at the Tories ' popularity .
First ,
Page mentions rising optimism about the state of the economy – according to Ipsos MORI 's research , the gap between positive and negative feelings about the economy 's prospects for next year is at its highest level for 12 years .
Next , he focuses on a general unease that seems to distance the Tories from some of their potential supporters : " I think there are still issues about the fact they have n't been tested in office .
There are lots of people who do n't like Old Etonians , though a lot of them are concentrated in Labour seats .
And there 's maybe a nagging anxiety about public services .
None of those things are killer factors , but there 's a slight queasiness about the fact that ' These posh people do n't really understand real lives , and they 're coming in to run to the country . ' "
Up at the University Of Strathclyde , the psephologist John Curtice talks about the share of people who describe themselves as " Tory identifiers " – not just Conservative voters but , in their own eyes , essentially Tory people .
As things stand , the numbers of Tory and Labour identifiers seem to be pretty much equal , meaning that the Conservative poll lead is classically " soft " – made up of people who , as he puts it , " have at least the potential to disappear " .
Curtice continues : " The reason the Conservative party looks to be in a strong position is , frankly , not because they 're doing particularly well .
It 's just that the Labour party is doing so badly .
In terms of shares of the vote , no government at this stage of a parliament has been as unpopular as this one .
The fact that Conservatives often have a double - digit lead is simply down to them being on around 40 and the Labour party coming in under 30 .
And 40 % , by historical standards , is nothing . "
Cameron , as Curtice acknowledges , has problems that Tony Blair never experienced .
Most fundamentally , unlike New Labour , the Tories are faced with an electoral system with an in - built bias against them : it must seem particularly cruel that Labour got a majority of seats in 2005 on a mere 35.3 % of the vote .
Consider also the seismic impact of the expenses crisis , and how it has squashed the prospect of any vast outpouring of enthusiasm for mainstream politicians .
In 1997 , Labour was able to wage war on so - called Tory " sleaze " and trade on the expectation of politics somehow being redeemed , which contrasts sharply with the across - the - board cynicism that represents one of Cameron 's biggest obstacles .
And then there is the problem posed by all those increasingly popular " other " options , in particular the UK Independence party .
When I call Nigel Farage – who recently stepped down as his party 's leader , but remains a zealous Ukip mouthpiece – he does exactly what you 'd expect , revelling in his party 's current status as troublemakers to Cameron 's right .
" I spent some time last weekend in Norfolk , " Farage tells me .
" I stayed at a country house , and went shooting with seven land - owning , farming - stroke - business Norfolk types .
One of the people I shot with gives the party a very large sum of money every year .
That 's just one segment of England , but it's what you would call classic Tory territory .
" For them , the breach of the promise on a treaty referendum is pretty fundamental stuff .
They 're also becoming increasingly uncomfortable about the whole issue of global warming .
Cameron 's encouragement and support for wind farm projects , a belief in increasing green taxes – well , that 's the second area where they find themselves at total variance to him .
The third is tax , where the acceptance of the 50 p band links into the idea that there 's no real difference between him and Labour .
The fourth I would go with , which came through very strongly in Norfolk , was education : the fact that Cameron has turned his back on the principle of selective education . "
He finishes with a menacing flourish : " Over the last few years , there are Conservative sources who have said the Ukip intervention at the last general election cost the Tories 28 seats .
There are signs that with Ukip where it is in the opinion polls today , we might cost them 50 .
And that could mean Cameron will not get a majority . "
If Farage sounds characteristically full of himself , it may be some token of these strange political times that you do not have to try too hard to find a similar fighting spirit among Labour party insiders .
For all Labour 's miseries , some pizzazz has returned to their campaigning , as seen in last month 's online wheeze , whereby Cameron and Osborne were done up as The X Factor 's joke - cum - phenomenon John and Edward , with the words : " You wo n't be laughing if they win . "
The idea came from Labour 's ad people at Saatchi & Saatchi – according to one Downing Street insider , approving it " was a no - brainer ; there was no research involved , but even we were surprised at how much it took off " .
There is , of course , a you - would - say - that element to Labour people 's views of Cameron 's alleged weaknesses – but it's hard to doubt at least some of what they say .
Their essential charge is that many of the undecided voters Cameron needs to seduce are not convinced the Tories have undergone any kind of transformation .
This chimes with a recent Populus poll , in which only 28 % of people agreed the party has " really changed " .
There is also , they claim , a palpable unease about the Tory leader .
" People kind of like Cameron ; in lots of ways , his scores would be pleasing , " says Deborah Mattinson , Gordon Brown 's personal pollster .
" But underlying that is a sort of scepticism .
Put it this way : the car and bike thing really sticks .
Even now , I rarely do a focus group where that is n't mentioned spontaneously by somebody .
It 's one of those things that 's stuck , and the reason is it speaks to a truth that people identify about him .
There 's something about him that does n't quite ring true .
That 's very clear , and he 's never managed to make it go away . "
On the proviso that the observation is completely off - the - record , one Labour high - up tells me that Cameron 's self - appointed role as the supposed heir to Blair may be working against him :
" When people kind of fell in love with Blair , they had n't really seen a politician like that before .
Cameron is positioning himself in quite a similar way , and you know what ?
They 've seen it before , and in the end , they did n't like it .
It became very toxic , and I think there 's a halo effect from that which is personally contaminating for Cameron . "
Then there is this season 's great political hoo - ha : class , the Tory leader 's elevated background , and the fact that Labour has lately decided to start talking about it .
There may be more of an appetite for this tactic than some people would like to think : according to last week 's Sunday Times , 47 % of people polled agreed with the assertion that Cameron is " too wealthy and privileged to represent ordinary people " , and 52 % endorsed the idea that the Tories are " still the party of the rich " .
At the weekend , the privately educated Alistair Darling and the work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper attempted to ratchet down the political attacks focusing on Cameron 's Eton schooling , which points up an interesting unease among most of the Labour people I talk to .
There again , echoing Ipsos MORI 's Ben Page , one Labour pollster I speak to says that among the voters they meet , Cameron 's background is undoubtedly an issue : " What it plays to is , ' Are they in touch with me ?
I 'm a mum living in Harlow , working for £ 7.50 an hour and getting my kids to the childminder – what does he know about my life ? ' "
What 's perhaps most telling is that it is not just archetypal lefties who point to the political salience of all this .
" We did really heavy - duty polling over the summer , " says Chris Fox , the Liberal Democrats ' director of policy and communications .
" One of the things we did was take 20 or 30 people in the south - west who said they were thinking about voting Conservative , and spent four hours with them .
The overriding thing that came out was even people who were thinking about voting for them were n't doing it because of any real endorsement of their values .
And as soon as you got them to pick imagery for the Tory party , it was all about class , looking after one part of society , and all those things .
That 's in the south - west ; further north , it becomes even more ingrained . "
So what can the Tories do ?
" It would be much better , psychologically and in campaigning terms , to be above 40 % , " says a high - ranking member of the shadow cabinet and Cameron ally .
" But you can spend forever checking your pulse .
The important thing is to be match - fit . "
Among other things , he tells me that the Tories should be worrying far more about " aspirational centrists " than disaffected voters on the right , and agrees that with six months or so until the general election , there is much work to do on the kind of clear and punchy message that New Labour managed 12 years ago .
Having said that , he agrees a Tory version of 1997 would be unthinkable , pointing to the expenses crisis – and the damage done to the Westminster elite by the financial crash and recession – as the key reason why the outcome of the next election will feel altogether more equivocal .
" It 's very , very rare that you 've had an opposition leader who has exercised the kind of supremacy that Blair did .
The crucial thing there was , while the Tories were deeply tarnished and compromised , the opposition was fresh and untainted .
The problem now is that all politicians are tarnished and compromised , and therefore the idea that you would invest hope in any politician is a lot more difficult . "
The essential message coming out of the highest Tory circles is simple enough : in such hard and doom - laden times , you bin your expectations of a landslide , assume a much more realistic view of the world , and understand that only power will allow you to seal any kind of deal .
Comparing an Old Etonian with British history 's most famous grocer 's daughter is n't the easiest business , but there are Conservative voices who point to Margaret Thatcher 's uncertain place in the public 's affections as leader of the opposition , and hold out the idea that Cameron and his people may be able to approximate the route that eventually led to her dominance of politics in the 1980s .
Still , there is a twitchiness around the Tory leadership – partly reflected in the way Cameron seems to be hyperactively bouncing all over the political spectrum , and from issue to issue .
A fortnight ago , he was endorsing the Tory guru Phillip Blond 's expansive vision of " Red Toryism " , only to then expend no little energy bemoaning the bog- standard Daily Mail straw man that is Health and Safety .
Towards the end of November , the Tories went on the offensive over the decline of marriage ; yesterday , Cameron spoke to the single - parent pressure group Gingerbread .
Underneath just about everything they do , perhaps , is an unresolved personality - split between their cuddly " progressive " side , and the part of them that cannot let go of the crabby , moralistic politics that are still threaded into the Tories ' DNA .
The upshot : none of the choreographed consistency that New Labour showed as they glided towards power in the mid-1990s .
So , the Conservatives may well take Somerton and Frome , and Crawley , and Harlow , and Cardiff North , and plenty of their other target seats , but even some of their own people think they might not get a majority at Westminster – at which point , we will plunge into a scenario we have not seen in well over 30 years .
Last week , I asked a high - ranking shadow minister what they thought was the most likely outcome of the next election .
" A minority Conservative government , " he told me .
" But then again , I 'm the most pessimistic person I know . "
The World from Berlin Yemen Offers Al - Qaida Fighters a Natural Base
After the foiled attack on a US airliner , Yemen is suddenly the focus of the war on terror .
As embassies shut and Yemeni security forces intensify their operations against al - Qaida , the US is doubling its counterterrorism aid to the impoverished country .
German commentators , however , doubt that the West will be any more successful here than in Afghanistan .

About 900 sq ft ( 85 sq m ) has been uncovered , but the home could be bigger
Archaeologists in Israel say they have uncovered the remains of the first dwelling in Nazareth believed to date back to the time of Jesus Christ .
The discovery sheds light on how people lived 2,000 years ago , when Christians believe Jesus was growing up there , Israel 's Antiquities Authority said .
A spokeswoman said Jesus and his childhood friends likely knew the home .
It was found near the place where angel Gabriel is believed to have told Mary that she would give birth to Jesus .
The archaeologists found the remains of a wall , a hideout , and a cistern for collecting rain water .
" The building that we found is small and modest and it is most likely typical of the dwellings in Nazareth in that period , " said Yardenna Alexandre of the Antiquities Authority , who directed the dig .
She said the 1st Century home , near the present - day Church of the Annunciation , is believed to have housed a " simple Jewish family " in two rooms and courtyard .
She described Nazareth , now Israel 's largest Arab city with a population of 65,000 people , as a " small hamlet " during the time of Jesus .
The discovery was made when builders dug up the courtyard of a former convent to make room for a new Christian centre .
The dwelling will now become a part of the new centre , which is being built by the French Roman Catholic group , Chemin Neuf .
This weekend in California , Restore Equality 2010 is launching a statewide event , called 10 for 2010 .
Volunteers from across the state will be meeting in their communities for training to be leaders and for signature gathering .
RE2010 needs to collect 1 million signatures in about 100 days to put Marriage Equality back on the Ballot in 2010 .
This weekend is the ramp up event for Feb 6th , where thousands of volunteers from across the state will come together with the goal of collecting over 100,000 signatures in one day .
How did I get involved in all of this ?
I guess it started working with Jim Neal as his Field Director in the 08 Democratic Primary race against now Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina .
Jim was also an openly gay man .
I never saw Jim as a " gay " candidate , I saw him as the best candidate .
And now , I do n't consider him my " gay " friend , he is just my friend .
On that campaign he taught me a valuable lesson which I have repeated time and time again .
" Vote for what you want , not what you think you can get .
" I moved out to California recently to be closer to my family .
I was hoping to try to settle into a " normal " life and leave campaigning behind me for a bit .
Then I came across RE2010 and their story was compelling .
RE2010 is a statewide grassroots organization of volunteers and a coalition of organizations who are dedicated to restoring equality in 2010 because they believe Californians should n't have to wait to be considered equal .
I agree with them , no one should have to wait to be considered Equal .
The time is now to be visible and outspoken .
Whether this goes to the ballot in 2010 in 2012 or gets decided in the courts , we need a strong visible movement now .
I believe you have to keep banging into the wall of discrimination until you knock it down .
You can never wait for it to just fall down by itself .
So we will be hitting the streets this weekend to fight for Equality and we need your help .
Let us show you through our work that this is possible .
Jim Neal has made a pledge of $ 1 for every volunteer who shows up to be trained on today and will pledge to raise matching funds of 10 dollars of every donation today .
Will you match his donation ?
Every dollar makes a difference .
As I mentioned this is a grassroots movement and we need to properly support our volunteer program .
Join us in making history .
The first dozen donors today -- who give at least $ 25 to Restore Equality 2010 here at ActBlue will get a " thank you " fromin the form of a double CD package , Quixotic by Matt Keating .
( If you want to donate but do n't want us to send the 2 - CD set , just add one penny to your contribution . )

CAPE CORAL , Fla. , Dec. 11 ( UPI ) --
Authorities in Florida said a former UPS driver allegedly stole 350 items sent via the shipping service and sold them on eBay .
Documents released by the state attorney 's office revealed Craig Podleski , 38 , of Cape Coral , Fla. , is accused of stealing $ 250,000 worth of items he was supposed to deliver during the course of several years and selling the items under eBay username Bulldoglover4life , the Fort Myers ( Fla . )
News - Press reported Friday .

He could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted .
Podleski's wife , Cheryl Podleski , 43 , was charged with helping her husband sell the stolen items .
She could face a maximum prison sentence of five years .
Authorities said numerous stolen items were found at the couple 's home , including firearms , jewelry and electronics .
Investigators said they have not yet determined the amount of money Podleski allegedly made from selling the stolen goods on eBay , other auction sites and garage sales .
WASHINGTON , Dec 14 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government must craft a plan next year to get its ballooning debt under control or face possible panic in financial markets , a bipartisan panel of budget experts said in a report on Monday .
Though the government should hold off on immediate tax hikes and spending cuts to avoid harming the fragile economic recovery , it will need to make such painful changes by 2012 in order to keep debt at a manageable 60 percent of GDP by 2018 , according to the Peterson - Pew Commission on Budget Reform .
Without action , investors could lose confidence in the United States , driving down the dollar and forcing up interest rates , said the former lawmakers and budget officials who crafted the report .
That could cause a sharp decrease in the country ’s standard of living .
“ We will be less free if we do n’t tackle this , ” said Jim Nussle , a Republican member of the commission who earlier served as a White House budget director and chairman of the budget committee in the U.S. House of Representatives .
The 34 - member commission published its report as Congress was poised to raise the debt limit from its current $ 12.1 trillion level to allow the government to continue operating .
The national debt has more than doubled since 2001 , thanks to the worst recession since the 1930s , several rounds of tax cuts and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A looming wave of retirements over the coming decade is expected to make the situation worse .
The national debt currently accounts for 53 percent of GDP , up from 41 percent a year ago .
That ’s likely to rise to 85 percent of GDP by 2018 and 200 percent of GDP by 2038 unless dramatic changes are made , the commission said .
The commission did not issue specific prescriptions but said tax increases and spending cuts would probably be needed .
It said Congress and the Obama administration should set specific targets each year , with automatic spending reductions and tax increases kicking in if they are not reached .
The Democratic - controlled Congress is unlikely to fix the problem on its own given the highly partisan atmosphere , commission members said .
“ You ’ve got to have a few Republican votes , and there have been none .
And there has been no possible way in the current political system yet to find that sensible center , ” said former Democratic Representative Charlie Stenholm .
The commission backed the creation of an outside commission , similar to one used to close miliary bases , to create the necessary political cover .
Such a proposal is included in a crush of year - end legislation that could clear Congress this week but it is opposed by many key Democrats .
The United States must act to ensure that it does not join Dubai , Greece , and other countries that risk losing the confidence of investors , the commission said .
“ It ’s imperative that we take action before the financial markets force us to , ” said Douglas Holtz - Eakin , a former Congressional Budget Office director who advised Republican John McCain ’s presidential campaign last year .

In a supernova remnant known as the Jellyfish Nebula , Suzaku detected X - rays from fully ionized silicon and sulfur -- an imprint of higher - temperature conditions immediately following the star 's explosion .
The nebula is about 65 light - years across .
Credit : JAXA / NASA / Suzaku
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Studies of two supernova remnants using the Japan - U.S. Suzaku observatory have revealed never - before - seen embers of the high - temperature fireballs that immediately followed the explosions .
Even after thousands of years , gas within these stellar wrecks retain the imprint of temperatures 10,000 times hotter than the sun 's surface .
" This is the first evidence of a new type of supernova remnant -- one that was heated right after the explosion , " said Hiroya Yamaguchi at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research in Japan .
A supernova remnant usually cools quickly due to rapid expansion following the explosion .
Then , as it sweeps up tenuous interstellar gas over thousands of years , the remnant gradually heats up again .
Capitalizing on the sensitivity of the Suzaku satellite , a team led by Yamaguchi and Midori Ozawa , a graduate student at Kyoto University , detected unusual features in the X - ray spectrum of IC 443 , better known to amateur astronomers as the Jellyfish Nebula .
The remnant , which lies some 5,000 light - years away in the constellation Gemini , formed about 4,000 years ago .
The X - ray emission forms a roughly circular patch in the northern part of the visible nebulosity .
Suzaku's X-ray Imaging Spectrometers ( XISs ) separate X - rays by energy in much the same way as a prism separates light into a rainbow of colors .
This allows astronomers to tease out the types of processes responsible for the radiation .
Some of the X - ray emission in the Jellyfish Nebula arises as fast - moving free electrons sweep near the nuclei of atoms .
Their mutual attraction deflects the electrons , which then emit X - rays as they change course .
The electrons have energies corresponding to a temperature of about 12 million degrees Fahrenheit ( 7 million degrees Celsius ) .
Several bumps in the Suzaku spectrum were more puzzling .
" These structures indicate the presence of a large amount of silicon and sulfur atoms from which all electrons have been stripped away , " Yamaguchi said .
These " naked " nuclei produce X - rays as they recapture their lost electrons .
But removing all electrons from a silicon atom requires temperatures higher than about 30 million degrees F ( 17 million C ) ; hotter still for sulfur atoms .
" These ions cannot form in the present - day remnant , " Yamaguchi explained .
" Instead , we 're seeing ions created by the enormous temperatures that immediately followed the supernova . "
The team suggests that the supernova occurred in a relatively dense environment , perhaps in a cocoon of the star 's own making .
As a massive star ages , it sheds material in the form of an outflow called a stellar wind and creates a cocoon of gas and dust .
When the star explodes , the blast wave traverses the dense cocoon and heats it to temperatures as high as 100 million degrees F ( 55 million C ) , or 10,000 times hotter than the sun 's surface .
Eventually , the shock wave breaks out into true interstellar space , where the gas density can be as low as a single atom per cubic centimeter -- about the volume of a sugar cube .
Once in this low - density environment , the young supernova remnant rapidly expands .
The expansion cools the electrons , but it also thins the remnant 's gas so much that collisions between particles become rare events .
Because an atom may take thousands of years to recapture an electron , the Jellyfish Nebula 's hottest ions remain even today , the astronomers reported in the Nov. 1 issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
" Suzaku sees the Jellyfish 's hot heart , " Ozawa said .
The team has already identified another fossil fireball in the supernova remnant known as W49B , which lies 35,000 light - years away in the constellation Aquila .
In the Nov. 20 edition of The Astrophysical Journal , Ozawa , Yamaguchi and colleagues report X - ray emission from iron atoms that are almost completely stripped of electrons .
Forming these ions requires temperatures in excess of 55 million degrees F ( 30 million C ) -- nearly twice the observed temperature of the remnant 's electrons .
Launched on July 10 , 2005 , Suzaku was developed at the Japanese Institute of Space and Astronautical Science ( ISAS ) , which is part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) , in collaboration with NASA and other Japanese and U.S. institutions .

Cup of coffee after a night on the town to sober up ?
Well , a mouse study finds that caffeine does not counter the intoxicating effects of alcohol .
It merely masks the inebriation , which could lead to poor decisions .
Because drinkers might think they ’ve sobered up , whereas they could just be more wired .
The study is in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience .
Researchers gave mice doses , separately and together , of caffeine and alcohol .
Tests then gauged how well the mice learned how to avoid part of a maze that appeared dangerous because of bright lights or loud sounds .
And mouse anxiety was tested , through their willingness to be in an open area .
No surprise , drunk animals were more relaxed and had less anxiety , and had trouble learning to avoid possible danger .
Then the mice got alcohol and caffeine together .
And the caffeine did not improve a drunk animal ’s ability to learn .
So the mouse is more relaxed but less able to avoid threats — if it had a tiny car available it probably would have thought it was “ fine , I ’m fine enough to drive it . ”

Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to a higher number of heart and stroke - related deaths among black Americans compared to whites , according to a University of Rochester Medical Center study .
The journal Annals of Family Medicine is publishing the study in the January - February edition , which goes online Jan. 11 , 2010 .
Researchers sought to understand the well - documented disparity between blacks and whites in cardiovascular deaths .
They turned to vitamin D because growing evidence links low serum levels of D to many serious illnesses including diabetes , hypertension , kidney and heart disease .
Lead author Kevin Fiscella , M.D. , said a complex host of genetic and lifestyle factors among blacks may explain why this population group has lower vitamin D levels across the lifespan than other races .
People get vitamin D through their diets , sun exposure , and oral supplements .
Genetic factors common to blacks sometimes preclude vitamin D absorption , such as a higher incidence of lactose intolerance , which can eliminate vitamin - D fortified milk from the diet , and darker skin pigment that significantly reduces vitamin D synthesis .
" Therefore , our study suggests that the next step would be to intervene to boost vitamin D levels safely , with supplements , " said Fiscella , a national expert on disparities in health care and a professor of Family Medicine and Community and Preventive Medicine at URMC .

With funding through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute , Fiscella and colleagues studied a sample of more than 15,000 American adults .
The data included measurements of blood levels of vitamin D and death rates due to cardiovascular disease .
Researchers also looked at other factors that contribute to heart health , such as body mass index , smoking status and levels of C - reactive protein .
Overall , the analysis showed that , as expected , a vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher rates of death among all people in the sample .
In fact , those adults with the worst deficiency had a 40 percent higher risk of death from cardiac illness .
This suggests that vitamin D may be a modifiable , independent risk factor for heart disease , Fiscella said .
Most striking , however , was that when researchers adjusted the statistics to look at race , blacks had a 38 percent higher risk of death than whites .
As vitamin D levels rose , however , the risk of death was reduced .
The same was true when researchers analyzed the effect of poverty on cardiovascular death rates among blacks , which suggests that vitamin D deficiency and poverty each exert separate risk factors , the study said .
A review article published in September 2009 in The American Journal of Medicine , noted that Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem .
In the U.S. , inadequate Vitamin D has been reported in about 36 percent of otherwise healthy young adults and about 57 percent of general medicine hospitalized patients .
Vitamin D is metabolized in the liver and converted to 25 hydroxyvitamin D or 25 ( OH ) D , the form used to determine a person 's status through a blood test .
Deficiency is usually defined by levels of less than 20 nanograms per milliliter ; 30 ng / ml is viewed as sufficient .
The mean blood level in the study sample was 29.5 ng/ml .
Most of the body 's tissues and cells have vitamin D receptors , making it a potent regulator of cell activity and growth .
A deficiency contributes to inflammation associated with heart disease , many cancers and poor bone health .
Fiscella cautions , however , that not all observational studies of vitamin deficiency are borne out by subsequent clinical trials .
For example , previous observational studies of vitamin E and beta - carotene that were associated with poor heart health did not hold up in later clinical studies .
The need to further assess the vitamin D connection to heart disease is convincing , however , particularly among blacks , he added .
Other at - risk people include the obese and the elderly , ( particularly housebound or nursing home residents ) , because vitamin D levels decline with age .
And although more sun exposure can boost levels of D , skin cancer is also an increasing risk to many people .
Therefore , medical authorities usually recommend increased dietary intake and / or supplementation as the best way to correct a deficiency .
Mechanical System Overview
The guitar player is composed of two mechanical systems that interact to play a range of 29 musical notes .
A plucking mechanism with six independently controlled picks is mounted over the body of the guitar and a fingering mechanism with an array of 23 fingertips is mounted over the first four frets of the fingerboard .
Figure 1 : Overall view of the player guitar showing the guitar mounted on the electrical enclosure and the plucking and fingering mechanisms mounted above the guitar .
Guitar Mounting and Electrical Enclosure
The guitar is mounted horizontally with the strings parallel to the mounting surface and is supported at the end of the neck and at two points on the upper part of the guitar body ( see Figure 1 above ) .
The guitar rests on rubber isolation pads and is clamped in place by small adjustable toggle clamps .
This mounting arrangement is secure and offers easy adjustment of the guitar position relative to the actuation mechanisms .
The rubber mounts help isolate the guitar vibration from the rest of the system where vibration could produce unwanted noise .
The guitar mounting board forms the top plate of the electrical enclosure that houses the control and power electronics for the guitar player .
The enclosure has two fixed panels on its short ends and two removable panels with magnetic latches on its long ends .
The front panel holds the main power switch , reset button , and vent grating for cooling .
The rear panel holds the power receptacle , MIDI receptacle and the cooling fan .
The removable side panels allow easy access to the control and power circuitry .
Figure 2 shows the front , rear and open side panels of the enclosure .
Figure 2 : The electronics that control and power the guitar player are protected in a wood enclosure on top of which the guitar is mounted .
The removable side panels allow access to the electronics and the front and rear panels hold the switches and the power and MIDI receptacles .
Plucker Operation
The plucking mechanism mimics the action of a harpsichord .
In a harpsichord , the pick is driven upward by the force of the player striking a key on the keyboard .
The pick then strikes the string and causes it to vibrate .
When the key is released , the pick passes by the string to its original position without re-plucking the string .
The guitar plucking mechanism uses a similar plucking action , but was design for double - acting use , meaning that the string is plucked both on the up - stoke and down - stroke .
As shown in Figure 3 , the six picks are mounted on linear bearings that are actuated by two opposed solenoids through a rocker - arm assembly .
Figure 3 : Views of the plucking mechanism showing the double - acting rocker - arm assembly actuated by two opposed solenoids .
The rocker arms move small Teflon picks vertically to vibrate the strings .
By toggling the opposed solenoids between their up and down states , the rocker arms force the picks past the guitar strings , causing the strings to vibrate .
The rocker arms are stopped at the end of their travel by two opposed push - button switches .
These spring - loaded switches provide much quieter operation than solenoids alone .
Because the plucking mechanism is mounted vertically , the actuators must be kept latched during operation to prevent the pick from dropping onto the strings and causing unwanted damping .
The solenoids must be kept on continuously to provide this latching force , so the switches also serve the important function of dropping the latching current through the solenoids to a level that is acceptable for continuous duty .
This important function is discussed further in the electronics section .
Finger Board Operation
An array of 23 small plastic fingertips press the strings down to the frets to play the range of notes covered by the first four frets of the guitar .
Each fingertip is mounted on a linear bearing , which is actuated by a solenoid through a horizontal lever arm ( see Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 : Views of the fingering mechanism showing the lever arms actuated by an array of solenoids to press 23 small fingertips against the fingerboard of the guitar .
Small compression springs return the fingertips to their resting position above the strings where they do not interfere with the vibration of the strings .
The compactness of the array of fingertips poses significant challenges for actuation .
The lever arms were mounted at an angle in order to reach the center strings and the solenoid mounts were staggered vertically to pack them together as compactly as possible .
The linkage between the solenoid and lever arm was made with a threaded rod and clevis joint on the lever arm to provide easy mechanical adjustment in the height of the fingertips and the throw of the solenoid .
This fine adjustment is necessary to ensure that the fingertips provide adequate holding force when actuated and clearance of the strings in the off state .
Hubble ’s latest image is another stunner — and just look at all the galaxies !
Hubble has produced a new version of the Ultra Deep Field , this time in near - infrared light and taken with the newly installed Wide Field Camera 3 .
This is the deepest image yet of the Universe in near - infrared , and so the faintest and reddest objects in the image are likely the oldest galaxies ever identified , and they likely formed only 600 –900 million years after the Big Bang .
This image was taken in the same region as the visible Ultra Deep Field in 2004 , but this new deep view at longer wavelengths provides insights into how galaxies grew in their formative years early in the Universe ’s history .
“ Hubble has now re-visited the Ultra Deep Field which we first studied 5 years ago , taking infrared images which are more sensitive than anything obtained before , ” said Dr. Daniel Stark , a postdoctoral researcher from Cambridge University .
“ We can now look even further back in time , identifying galaxies when the Universe was only 5 percent of its current age – within 1 billion years of the Big Bang . ”
The image was taken during a total of four days in August 2009 , with 173,000 seconds of total exposure time .
Since infrared light is invisible to the human eye and therefore does not have colors that can be perceived , the image is a “ natural ” representation that in shorter infrared wavelengths are represented as blue and the longer wavelengths as red .
The faintest objects are about one billion times fainter than the dimmest visible objects seen with the naked eye .
Click here for a video zooming into the Ultra Deep Field .
“ The expansion of the Universe causes the light from very distant galaxies to appear more red , so having a new camera on Hubble which is very sensitive in the infrared means we can identify galaxies at much greater distances than previously possible , ” said Stephen Wilkins , from Oxford University .
The team that took this image in August of 2009 have made it available for research by astronomers worldwide , and a multitude of astronomers have been furiously searching through the data for the most distant galaxies yet discovered .
In just three months , twelve scientific papers on these new data have been submitted .
As well as identifying potentially the most distant objects yet , these new HST observations present an intriguing puzzle .
“ We know the gas between galaxies in the Universe was ionized ( or fried ) early in history , but the total light from these new galaxies may not be sufficient to achieve this , ” said Andrew Bunker , from the University of Oxford .
“ These new observations from HST are likely to be the most sensitive images Hubble will ever take , but the very distant galaxies we have now discovered will be studied in detail by Hubble ’s successor , the James Webb Space Telescope , which will be launched in 2014 , ” said Professor Jim Dunlop at the University of Edinburgh .

Google users may start seeing registration pages appear when they click for a sixth time on any given day at websites of publishers using the programme , according to Mr Cohen .
This will only affect websites that currently charge for content .
' Significant move '
The announcement is seen as a reaction to concerns in the newspaper industry that Google is using newspaper content unfairly .
Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch , the chairman and chief executive of Newscorp , has accused firms such as Google of profiting from journalism by generating advertising revenue by linking readers to newspaper articles .
Some readers have discovered they can avoid paying subscription fees to newspaper websites by calling up their pages via Google .
ANALYSIS Tim Weber , business editor , BBC News website
The dispute between media groups and Google reflects the general confusion over how traditional media can make money on the internet .
Every newspaper owner angry about Google 's linking policy can use a simple remedy : add two lines of code to a file on your servers and Google will leave you alone .
Deep down , most media owners realise that the old " publish it and they will come " principle does not work in an on - demand world .
If Google would not link to their websites , the very same media groups would bitterly complain about Google 's refusal to generate valuable online traffic .
Unless you own premium content ( from the Wall Street Journal at one end to porn at the other ) , making money from on - demand content means first and foremost that your audiences have to be able to find you .
The problem : Nobody has quite figured out a business model for a world where consumers do n't want their morning or evening news , but want the Now O'clock News - the " on-demand and to my taste " news .
This is because Google searches frequently link directly to newspaper articles , bypassing some sites ' subscription systems .
Broadcasting and media consultant Steve Hewlett said that Google 's response was " a pretty significant move " .
" Rupert Murdoch is trying to build a consensus that paying for content online is right and that aggregators like Google that use newspaper content but do n't pay for it are doing something wrong , " he said .
Search for revenue Newspapers are increasingly looking for new ways to make money from their online content amid a continuing decline in circulation figures and advertising revenues .
Earlier this week Johnston Press , the UK 's largest regional newspaper publisher , announced plans to to begin charging for access to six of its titles online .
The move follows a 42 % slump in advertising revenues at the group over the last two years .
Earlier this year , the Daily Mail and General Trust ( DMGT ) cut 1,000 jobs at its regional arm Northcliffe Media , which publishes more than 100 newspapers in England and Wales .
Newscorp , which owns the Times and the Sun newspapers in the UK , has also been affected by the downturn .
In June , it announced losses of $ 3.4bn ( £ 2bn ) for the previous 12 months , describing the year as " the most difficult in recent history " .
It has also revealed plans to begin charging for access to all its online content .
The corporation currently charges for access to its US title the Wall Street Journal .

The Invention of the Jewish People
by Shlomo Sand
( Verso , 2009 )
First published in Hebrew as Matai Ve ’ekh Humtzaa Ha’am Hayehudi
( Resling , 2008 )
In the preface to this book ’s English - language edition , Tel Aviv University historian Shlomo Sand describes the “ odd ” reception that his book engendered on its publication in Israel : journalists were interested , academics enraged :
Representatives of the “ authorized ” body of historians fell on the book with academic fury , and excitable bloggers depicted me as an enemy of the people .
Perhaps it was this contrast that prompted the readers to indulge me — the book stayed on the bestseller list for nineteen weeks .
Sand explains this sharp split among his book ’s Israeli readers by pointing to a widening gulf between Israeli ’s public intellectuals , many of whom are critical of a strident nationalism based on Jewish ethnic solidarity , and his colleagues in the large history departments of Israeli universities , who are enmeshed in an academic system that separates ( and privileges ) “ Jewish history ” from “ general history . ”
It is a Scandal
In the United States , as we shall see , the response to the book has been even odder .
In September , Forward blogger Daniel Treitman ’s predicted a furor upon the book ’s publication .
Soon after , reviewer Hillel Halkin attacked Sand ’s credentials ( questioning his standing as an historian ) even before he attempts to demolish his argument :
As the work of a supposed historian at the University of Tel Aviv , it is a scandal , a fashionably political screed against Zionism that cherry - picks its data while pretending to be history …
The author of Letters to an American Jewish Friend , Halkin has never been one to hide his political allegiances ( which have drifted steadily to the right ) .
In a Forward article from February 2004 he praised neoconservative Norman Podhoretz , writing that “ his contribution to the battle for intellectual sanity in twentieth - century America has been , in my opinion a heroic one , ” and praises Podhoretz ’s “ impressive incisiveness and courage . ”
For Sand and other Israeli critics on the political Left , Israel ’s dilemma is that it insists on the uniqueness and privileged status of the Jewish narrative , while presenting itself — to both its own citizens and to outsiders — as a democracy .
Sand refers to Israel as an “ ethnic state , ” a term borrowed from Oren Yiftachel ’s book Ethnocracy : Land and Identity in Politics in Israel / Palestine .
For Yiftachel , Sand , and other Israeli critics , the flaw in Israel ’s political system is that Israeli nationalism favors the majority over the large Arab minority ( twenty percent of the population ) .
The aspiration of these critics is that Israel become “ a republic of its citizens , ” one in which no ethnic groups would be favored .
“ Israeli identity ” inclusive of Jews , Arabs , and all other residents , rather than “ Jewish identity ” should be the criterion for inclusion in the polity of the state .
Writing in Le Monde Diplomatique , Sand asserted that any definition of the state that relies on a distinction between Jew and non-Jew is an obstacle to democracy , and that
a global ethnocracy invokes the myth of the eternal nation , reconstituted on the land of its ancestors , to justify internal discrimination against its own citizens .
It will remain difficult to imagine a new Jewish history while the prism of Zionism continues to fragment everything into an ethnocentric spectrum .
In one of the books many zingers , Sand concretizes these somewhat abstract ideas .
Critical of the “ Law of Return , ” which puts Jews from any country on the fast - track to Israeli citizenship , he condemns a system of law that favors ethnicity over citizenship :
In fact anyone born to a Jewish mother may have the best of both worlds — being free to live in London or New York , confident that the State of Israel is theirs , even if they do not wish to live under its sovereignty .
Yet anyone who did not emerge from Jewish loins and who lives in Jaffa or Nazareth will feel that the state in which they were born will never be theirs .
To Read What Has Really Been Written
In what I think was a tactical error , rather than make the citizenship and democracy question the central issue of the book , Sand undermines his argument by making claims about Jewish history that are difficult to substantiate .
As one astute commenter on the Haaretz Web site put it , Sand ’s book is more about the past than the future .
Interviewed by that newspaper ’s correspondent , Sand responded strongly to both academic and popular criticism of his thesis .
But it is the book ’s claims about the Jewish past that have caused the biggest buzz and generated the strongest condemnation by Israeli historians of the Jewish past .
These critics point out that Shlomo Sand ’s area of academic expertise is the intellectual history of modern France .
His previous book was Intellectuals , Truth and Power — From the Dreyfus Affair to the Gulf War , published by Israeli ’s prestigious press , Am Oved .
He is not , nor does he claim to be , a historian of Jews and Judaism .
Two Israeli historians whose specialty is modern Jewish history have criticized Shlomo Sand ’s presentation of the Jewish past .
Both Israel Bartal and Anita Shapira , senior scholars at Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University respectively have responded to Shlomo Sand in scholarly articles .
Bartal , playing on the book ’s Hebrew title When and How the Jewish People Were Invented , titled his review “ Inventing an Invention . ”
Bartal calls Sand ’s book “ learned and fascinating . ”
Despite this limited praise , Bartal ’s overall evaluation of the book is damning .
He finds many faults with Sand ’s historical method .
Like most of his Israeli colleagues , Bartal is an historical positivist , and he finds Sand ’s “ pinch of Foucaultian discourse ” disturbing in its “ superficiality . ”
In the concluding paragraph of his review , he condemns Sand ’s project and is quite prescient about the buzz that Sand ’s book would generate :
The lugubrious Israeli combination of aggressive one - dimensional conceptuality and blatant disrespect for details ( a characteristic mix among writers at both ends of the political spectrum ) will undoubtedly captivate the hearts of the public relations executives of the electronic media .
However , we , the skeptical historians , who are buried between mountains of books and piles of archival files , can only continue to read what has really been written and to write about what has really been read .
Bartal ’s Tel Aviv University colleague Anita Shapira is even more damning ; her review essay is titled “ The Jewish - People Deniers ” ( a title which evokes that dreaded description “ Holocaust denier ” ) .
According to Shapira , Sand ’s goal of harmony between Jews and Arabs , while reasonable in its own right bears the “ warped and objectionable ” requirement that Jews
alone of all the peoples in the region , must shed their national identity and historical memories and reconstruct themselves in a way that may ( perhaps ) find favor with Israeli - Palestinians .
But reconciliation between peoples makes necessary a mutual recognition of truth , not an artificial analysis that presents a fabricated front , a quasi - mask that hides the real differences .
What Sand is offering is this kind of artificial analysis .
As Halkin ’s review in the Forward illustrates , the book ’s somewhat nuanced reception in Israel has not been paralleled in Europe and the United States .
In Israel , critics took the book and its author seriously enough to write about its claims extensively .
In France , where it was published soon after it appeared in Israel , the book became a bestseller .
Sand was given the Prix Aujourd ’hui — a prestigious literary prize awarded to the best nonfiction book of the year .
As French history is Sand ’s field , and he is thoroughly at home in French language and culture , his television and radio appearances were quite successful .
But the French Jewish establishment was quite critical of the book .
From Brooklyn to Jerusalem
Thus far , some US journalists have attacked Sand ’s ideas — but there have been few full reviews — perhaps because the book is so scholarly and dense .
In a Wall Street Journal op - ed piece on October 30 , a critique of the book was embedded in an article by Evan R. Goldstein in the paper ’s series “ Houses of Worship . ”
The article focuses on Sand ’s argument that most of the Jews of Eastern Europe were descended from the Khazars , an eighth century A.D. Turkic tribe that converted en masse to Judaism .
In Goldstein ’s reading of Sand :
Put differently :
If most Jews are not Semites , then what justification is there for a Jewish state in the Middle East ?
By attempting to demonstrate the Khazar origins of Eastern European Jewry , Mr. Sand — a self - described post - Zionist who believes that Israel needs to shed its Jewish identity to become a democracy — aims to undermine the idea of a Jewish state .
Remarkably , the New York Times published an article titled “ Book Calls Jewish People an Invention ” without mentioning the call for political change that is at the heart of the book .
Patricia Cohen , the author of the article , makes no claim to have read Sand ’s book — and that in itself is both disturbing and revealing .
Though Sand may not always get his historical facts right , he is very astute about the present .
Particularly about the fate of scholars engaged in any critique of Israeli government policies : “ I know that there are a lot of organized Zionists that cannot accept the sort of criticism that one can voice in Israel .
But I want you to know I am not afraid of Alan Dershowitz ” .
Highly critical of American Jewish support of the Israeli Right , Sand notes that : “ since the late 1970s , the perpetuation of the Jewish ethnos state has paid handsome dividends , and the closer Brooklyn came to Jerusalem , the further was Arab Nazareth removed from the heartbeat of Jewish - Israeli politics .
That is why any project that proposed turning Israel into a republic of its citizens has come to seem like a fantasy . ”
Because Sand ’s claims about the Jewish past can easily be refuted , his critique of the Israeli present — and his concern for the Israeli future — will be summarily dismissed , at least in the United States .
The American fate of Israeli books critical of Israeli policies is predetermined : they are bound to fail — both in the actual marketplace , and in the marketplace of ideas .
Israel ’s Fateful Hour , a 1984 book by Yehoshafat Harkabi , the head of Israeli Military Intelligence in the 1950s , warned of the dire consequences for Israel of the longterm occupation of the West Bank and Gaza .
The book found no audience in the United States .
In that same Orwellian year , 1984 , another book on Israel was published — Joan Peter ’s From Time Immemorial : The Origins of the Arab - Jewish Conflict Over Palestine .
The book ’s claim that most of the Arabs of Palestine came to that land ( in the 1940s ! ) as a consequence of the Jewish ‘ state - in– the–making ’ was dismissed by all serious historians of the area — including mainstream historians at Israel ’s universities .
But that did n’t stop the book from garnering rave reviews and very large sales .
No less a literary lion than Saul Bellow predicted that “ millions of people the world over , smothered by false history and propaganda , will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the Palestinians . “
General Harkabi ’s book was ignored and forgotten ; From Time Immemorial has been in print since the day it was published to great fanfare .
What other fate can we expect for Shlomo Sand ’s flawed but thought - provoking book ?
Unanswered Questions
Command and Control in Chicago
Project Coronado
Implications
In an indictment handed down Nov. 20 , the U.S. Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois accused 15 individuals of being involved in the trafficking of cocaine and other narcotics in the Chicago area .
The 15 were arrested in a nationwide counter - narcotics operation led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) dubbed " Project Coronado , " which was aimed at dismantling the drug trafficking network of La Familia Michoacana ( LFM ) , a mid-sized and relatively new drug cartel based in Michoacan state in southwestern Mexico .
The U.S. investigation of LFM has revealed many details about the operation of the group in the United States and answered some important questions about the nature of Mexican drug trafficking and distribution north of the border .
LFM stands out among the various drug cartels that operate throughout Mexico for several reasons .
Unlike other drug trafficking organizations ( DTOs ) that have always been focused on drug trafficking , LFM first arose in Michoacan several years ago as a vigilante response to kidnappers and drug gangs .
Before long , however , LFM members were themselves accused of conducting the very crimes they had opposed , including kidnapping for ransom , cocaine and marijuana trafficking and , eventually , methamphetamine production .
The group is now the largest and most powerful criminal organization in Michoacan — a largely rural state located on Mexico 's southwestern Pacific coast — and maintains a significant presence in several surrounding states .
Beyond its vigilante origins , LFM has also set itself apart from other criminal groups in Mexico by its almost cult - like ideology .
LFM leaders are known to distribute documents to the group 's members that include codes of conduct and pseudo - religious quotations from Nazario Moreno Gonzalez , also known as " El Mas Loco " ( " the craziest one " ) , who appears to serve as a sort of inspirational leader of the group .
In April 2009 , STRATFOR published a report on the dynamics of narcotics distribution in the United States .
It laid out the differences between trafficking ( transporting large quantities of drugs from the suppliers to the buyers over the most efficient routes possible ) and distribution ( the smaller scale , retail sale of small quantities of drugs over a broader geographic area ) as well as the various gangs on the U.S. side that are involved in drug trafficking .
The report outlined the differences in the resources and skills required to transport tons of narcotics hundreds of miles through Mexico versus picking up those loads at the border and managing the U.S. retail networks that distribute narcotics to the individual buyers on the street .
In our April analysis , we identified several intelligence gaps in the interface between the Mexican - based drug traffickers ( such as the Sinaloa Cartel , the Beltran - Leyva Organization [ BLO ] and Los Zetas ) and the U.S. - based drug distributors ( such as MS - 13 , Barrio Azteca and the Mexican Mafia ) .
One question we were left with was :
How deeply involved are the Mexican DTOs in the U.S. distribution network ?
While it appeared that narcotics changed hands at the border , it was n't clear how or even whether the relationships between gangs and drug traffickers had an effect on the distribution of narcotics within the United States .
Although we suspected it , there was little evidence that showed cartel involvement in the downstream or retail distribution of narcotics in the U.S. market .
Now there is evidence .
The indictment handed down Nov. 20 in Chicago clearly alleges that a criminal group in Chicago was directly conspiring with the drug trafficking organization LFM to distribute shipments of cocaine .
The indictment specifically links the criminal group in Chicago to LFM and labels it a " command and control group " run by someone in Michoacan .
While the indictment only referred to this person as " individual A , " we suspect that the unidentified person was LFM operational manager Servando Gomez Martinez , the second in command of LFM .
The manager of the Chicago command and control group , Jorge Luis Torres - Galvan , and the distribution supervisor , Jose Gonzalez - Zavala , were allegedly in regular contact with their manager in Mexico , updating him on accounting issues and relying on him to authorize which wholesale distributors the group could do business with in the United States .
These wholesale distributors also appear to have had close ties to the command and control group .
According to the indictment , they were allowed to sell cocaine on consignment — they could wait to pay Zavala once the entire load was sold — an agreement that indicates a great deal of trust between the supplier and the retail distributor .
It was likely a matter of the LFM commander in Mexico authorizing their involvement and probably was based on an existing business or extended - family relationship .
Due to LFM 's ideological basis , its members should be thought of more as adherents than employees .
The group does not operate using the same business objectives as most other major DTOs , so we would expect personal relationships to be more valued than strictly business relationships among LFM members .
Another member of the group , Jorge Guadalupe Ayala - German , allegedly operated stash houses in the Chicago area where deliveries of narcotics would come in and shipments of cash would leave .
The indictment says Ezequel Hernandez - Patino was responsible for physically delivering the shipments of cocaine to the wholesale distributors , and Ismail Flores with Oscar Bueno were responsible for transporting money south to Dallas , where they would deliver cash proceeds from the sale of cocaine and pick up more cocaine to sell .
The indictment does not indicate that Flores or Bueno supplied any other markets between Dallas and Chicago , which suggests that the Chicago - based LFM members were fairly compartmentalized .
The larger operation from which the Chicago indictment emerged , the DEA - led Project Coronado , was a joint operation with the FBI , the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) and numerous other agencies .
It followed several similar nationwide sweeps such as Operation Xcellerator , a multi-year effort to dismantle the Sinaloa cartel 's connections in the United States , and Project Reckoning , which went after a Gulf cartel network in the United States that was trafficking cocaine to Italy .
Under Project Coronado , the DEA , FBI and ATF , along with other federal , state and local law enforcement agencies , have made a total of almost 1,200 arrests , seized $ 32.8 million in U.S. currency and seized 11.7 tons of marijuana , methamphetamines , cocaine and heroin since the operation began in 2005 .
Dozens of other indictments and criminal complaints ( in addition to the Chicago indictment ) have been unsealed against associates of the group across the country since Oct. 22 , the official culmination of Project Coronado .
The other cases revealed more details about LFM 's operations in the United States : how it trafficked methamphetamines and cocaine from Mexico to Dallas , how a cell in Nashville was supplied by a distribution hub in Atlanta , and how a group in New York had obtained automatic assault rifles , high - caliber pistols and ammunition with the intent to smuggle those weapons back to Mexico to supply LFM .
LFM has been responsible for a substantial level of violence in southwestern Mexico , and former Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Morina Mora recently called it the most dangerous cartel in Mexico .
The Northern District of Texas had the most cases as a result of Project Coronado .
It appears that Dallas was a major U.S. hub for LFM , where it managed drug shipments from Mexico to other regions ( Chicago and Arkansas were specifically mentioned ) and the collection of cash from those distributors before shipping the cash back to Mexico .
Dallas is a logical hub for such activity because of its proximity to Mexico and its location along Interstate 35 and Interstate 20 , which link Dallas to the rest of the United States as well as points to the south .
In at least one case , an individual attempting to smuggle four kilograms of methamphetamines to Dallas passed through the McAllen , Texas , border crossing on a passenger bus but was interdicted by police .
Most indictments ( including the one in Chicago ) pointed out that LFM groups in the United States conducted countersurveillance while moving drug shipments .
On one occasion , accused Dallas drug distributor Soto Cervantes changed the location of a meet - up point when he learned that the person he was meeting suspected that he was being followed .
The change in location caused the police ( who were indeed following the transporter ) to call off the surveillance mission in order to not compromise their investigation .
As a result , authorities relied primarily on electronic surveillance of the suspects ' communications through wiretaps on home and cellular phones — of which the suspects had many and which they changed frequently .
There were other cases when police were unable to follow suspects due to such surveillance detection tactics , when targeted traffickers called off meetings and changed vehicles in an effort to confuse police .
While seemingly simple , these tactics indicate a higher degree of tradecraft and professionalism among the suspects linked to LFM , who do n't appear to be members of run -of - the - mill street gangs .
It is unclear if these tactics have been institutionalized in the LFM network , but judging by the frequency that police encountered them in various U.S. cities during Project Coronado , they appear to be a standard practice for many if not all LFM members .
The details released in the Nov. 20 indictment provide solid evidence that drug trafficking organizations in Mexico ( specifically LFM ) have established command and control groups inside the United States that report to and receive orders from commanders in Mexico .
And this shows that LFM has had an international presence far beyond what we originally suspected and is not just a small - time trafficking group in southwestern Mexico .
Whereas most drug distribution in the United States is carried out by individual gangs serving their own interests and operating on their own familiar turf , the criminal group in Chicago working for LFM was carrying out orders issued by a drug trafficking organization some 3,000 miles away .
And based on the interaction the Chicago group had with its contact in Mexico , the use of such tactics as countersurveillance measures , the coordination among groups in different cities and reports from STRATFOR sources within U.S. counternarcotics agencies , it is likely that the individual in Mexico was managing several groups throughout the United States .
Most criminal enterprises avoid this kind of command and control structure for two reasons .
First , distribution in a foreign country is not typically in a Mexican - based drug trafficker 's area of expertise .
Their interests tend to focus on their own territory , which they can control much more easily due to their familiarity with and proximity to it .
Second , as seen in these latest arrests , U.S. law enforcement agencies are much more proficient at thwarting drug distribution operations than Mexican law enforcement agencies are .
( LFM has recently proved very proficient indeed at challenging Mexican security forces .)
By passing the drugs off to gangs in the United States , major cartels are also able to avoid a great deal of liability at the hands of U.S. law enforcement .
In a way , LFM 's efforts to move downstream , farther from the source of the cocaine , mirror those of other , larger Mexican DTOs that are expanding their control over the supply of cocaine in South America as they move upstream , closer to the source .
And this raises the question :
Why would LFM want to expand its operations so deeply into the United States when other Mexican DTOs maintain a more superficial presence there ?
One possible answer is that LFM is much smaller than Sinaloa , Los Zetas and BLO , controls much less territory and gets a smaller share of the narcotics being trafficked through Mexico .
By expanding business into the United States , LFM is able to leverage what little control it does have in order to gain access to the highly lucrative retail market .
And then there is LFM 's ideological bent , which makes it behave at times more like a cult than a purely pragmatic business .
Our answer to the above question is only conjecture .
What is certain , at this point , is that there is now a precedent for Mexican DTOs to have a greater influence over their lower - level supply - chain operations in the United States .
The details released in the Chicago indictment provide a better understanding of how Mexican - based drug traffickers impact the drug distribution network inside the United States and prove that at least one , " La Familia , " is taking a very hands - on approach .
Last week we had a bit of fun and looked at technologies for budding dictators , but this week we 're looking at the other side of the coin – how to stay safe online if your future depends on it .
Honourable Mention : Hacking
Shaun Nichols :
At first we were n't sure how to classify this one .
Malware was n't really the right term , neither was spyware .
We decided to just go ahead and use the label ' hacking ' .
Regardless of how you label it , there are times in the battle for freedom when you may need to access a system under less than , well , conventional means .
At those times , you may need to use some tools to bypass security protections and authentication components .
That 's not to say we 're endorsing such activity .
Whether your motives are just or not , that sort of thing is considered illegal pretty much everywhere , and people who get caught will undoubtedly face some unpleasant consequences .
There are , however , times when the risk of imprisonment and punishment are worth the potential reward .
Iain Thomson :
Is it OK to break the law in a moral cause ?
Many people who are now great statesman once thought so ; Nelson Mandela comes to mind .
Sadly the courts disagree .
As we are seeing in the case of Gary McKinnon when the US nabs you on terrorism charges for hacking it does n't mess about .
McKinnon is n't a freedom fighter , merely someone with mental problems who thought he was on a quest to unveil the truth about UFOs .
He 's now facing decades in prison for his activities .
In the wider world a measure of hacking is a prerequisite for getting open access to the internet at all in some countries .
There 's also less of a moral question about getting into the systems responsible for their repression , although the penalties are much more severe than McKinnon faces in many cases .
Honourable mention : Complicit companies .
Iain Thomson :
This was an unusual last minute entrant , suggested by Shaun in the light of last week 's Top 10 .
While initially I was sceptical Shaun made his case .
Certain companies are beginning to show some guts and say that business in China is about more than money .
This is not long before time .
China has an understandable aversion to some aspects of Western culture – considering that if the British , French and Russians had set up camp in Manhattan for 50 years by force of arms as Shanghai was America would be up in arms .
Since Google has come out against censorship , for whatever reasons , other Western companies have also been called on to make a stand .
If they will or not remains to be seen .
Shaun Nichols : Seeing as how Google inspired our top 10 tools for tyranny list , I think it is only fair that we include companies which do n't kowtow to oppressive regimes on our list .
It takes a lot of guts to say no to a government when you 're a business .
If you do n't do what you are told and the people in charge take notice of it , you and your employees are likely to all be out of jobs and possibly even behind bars .
If anything good has come out of the rise of multinational corporations , it is that some are becoming less beholden to governments and able to take a stand when something is not right .
China may be a huge economy , but Google has plenty of business elsewhere in the world .
If the company does pull out , they will hopefully be able to get along just fine .
10 . OpenDNS
Shaun Nichols :
We chose OpenDNS here , but there are a myriad of similar tools that can be used to take some of your dependency off of your local ISP and into your own hands and those of like - minded people .
For those unfamiliar , the DNS system is what allows clients and servers to link up the text of a URL with the numerical IP address of the server hosting the site .
The task of cataloguing and matching the URLs and IP addresses is handled by a DNS server , usually provided by the user 's ISP .
OpenDNS is a well - maintained DNS service which is free and open to all users , and for a great many people , it is far faster and more reliable than the ISP 's own servers .
Additionally , it is constantly maintained and updated to protect against possible attacks , such as the 2008 DNS cache - poisoning flaw .
It also gets one more activity out of the hands of ISPs , which are often more than willing to hand over information to government agencies .
Okay , so DNS information is n't exactly sensitive data , and it's not like OpenDNS would prevent an oppressive regime from keeping people down , but it 's at least a small way you can take some of your activity out of the ISP 's hands .
Iain Thomson : OpenDNS is n’t perfect by a long chalk but it is a very valuable tool .
Anything that gets your data out of the hands of the ISP is a good thing on the privacy front , especially if the ISP in question is run by the government and subject to constant monitoring .
In more closely - run internet monitoring states use of OpenDNS may also be a big red flag so be careful how you use it .
9. Clean Addresses
Iain Thomson : A must have for the budding activist is a clean email address .
Ideally this is one that has been used at all .
This involves using the account to write emails in draft form , and not sending them , but having a trusted contact who can also access the account , read the messages and type a draft response .
Even if emails are sent then such a low use account would raise few warning bells in unsophisticated monitoring regimes .
With the rise of mobile phone use for email then it would have to be a very quick monitor to pick up a signature .
This is a tactic used by many groups , both benign and malicious .
So - called ' clean skins ' are the hardest operatives to trap , because they have no record .
This is what makes it important to keep certain people solely as methods of communication , and from the other perspective , to keep watch on the behaviour of others .
Shaun Nichols :
This is one space where collaboration services such as Google Wave could prove valuable .
If users could access collaboration pages hosted in a safe location , they could communicate without having to worry about interception of those messages by authorities .
When combined with our earlier nod to companies that do n't give in to government pressures , you have a pretty effective tool for safe communication , at least until the local authorities contact your ISP and have the service blocked .
This is , as Iain noted , both potentially a good and bad thing .
While it could be used to subvert restrictions on free speech , it could also be used to facilitate the planning of malicious actions .
Which brings up a troublesome fact - " activists " and " freedom fighters " in one part of the world are usually considered " criminals " and " terrorists " in another part .
8. The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF )
Shaun Nichols :
While their global reach is still somewhat limited , the EFF is championed amongst the computing world for its tireless efforts on behalf of user rights and access to information .
Founded in 1990 by Mitch Kapor and John Peery Barlow , the EFF has used legal expertise to argue on behalf of the little guy .
The group 's efforts have included a prominent position in the fight against DRM software and takedown of user - submitted videos as well as tireless efforts to put once - classified government data online for all to see .
Additionally , the group has championed net neutrality and gone after labels and studios that use bully - tactics on users suspected of sharing media files online .
It 's somewhat scary to think about what the tech world would be like had it not been for the efforts of the EFF .
Iain Thomson :
To my mind the EFF is the biggest thing Mitch Kapor can be proud of in the tech arena , and considering the impact of Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 that 's saying something .
The EFF's web site is a treasure trove of useful stuff for anyone interested in staying private , which is probably why so many countries try to block it .
It contains software tools to help evade national firewalls to simple browser setting advice .
But it is the operation behind it that shines .
The EFF has proved a highly effective watchdog of the technology world and it keeps governments ( reasonably ) honest .
It mixes high profile investigations into illegal US government wire - tapping to more draw out legal battles .
If you are a technology user of almost any type then the EFF has got your back , and thankfully it 's very good at what it does .
7. Social media
Iain Thomson :
When the first plane hit the Twin Towers
On that day in September one camera recorded the first aircraft strike , that of a French documentary team filming new York firemen .
By contrast the vast bulk of the initial footage of the Haiti disaster has come from social media .
No - one can deny the instant coverage that social impact of social media .
The demonstrations in Iran , the Burmese monks and footage of the police in the US and UK have shown that the panopticon is swinging round from those that control the media to those that create and consume it .
On a personal note the moment this really kicked in was at last year 's G20 demonstrations in London , and the death of Ian Tomlinson .
Tomlinson was the only fatality of the demonstrations and at the time the police story was that he'd had a heart attack and medics tried to help him but were bottled off by protesters .
It was only after , ironically enough , a New York investment fund manager put the footage he had shot online , that the rest of the world saw his attack from behind by the police , while walking with his hands in his pockets .
London may have the highest concentration of CCTV cameras in the world but none of them caught this , but a bystander did .
Video recording technology is increasingly being embedded into many devices , and it is a very effective weapon against the ' official line . '
Add in the reach of YouTube , Twitter and Facebook and you have a powerful tool against oppression .
Shaun Nichols :
As we are now seeing , YouTube is n't just a place for goofy blooper videos and crackpot political rants , it is also a valuable way for people to share footage .
Increasingly , news services around the world are picking up on this and installing portals where users can upload and share their video of important events .
This is allowing users to capture and broadcast video of government , military and law - enforcement groups behaving badly and has in some cases also helped police bring violent criminals to justice .
As much as we like to malign their usefulness at times , social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter have also become tools for sharing information and campaigning for freedom and justice .
Not everyone has the time or interest to maintain a full blog , and few of us are able or willing to scroll through dozens of blogs a day .
The aggregator features of social networking sites allow multiple updates to be seen at once .
During a large and tumultuous event such as a protest or government crackdown , these sites do in fact become very useful tools for gathering information .
6 . Open source software
Shaun Nichols :
When people like Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds created the pillars of the open - source software movement , they did so with the fundamental belief that software and digital data should be open and accessible to all users .
This is , of course , quite conflicting with the basic tenants of tyrannical rule .
One of the great things about open - source software is that it can be opened up and tinkered with by just about anyone who wants to .
Additionally , open - source tools and applications can be more or less shared freely on the web .
This allows people who may otherwise not have access to the resources to both use the software and learn how to build and tinker with it themselves .
Tyranny is n't always apparent in the form of outright oppression , often it comes in the form of purposefully maintained ignorance .
Open source software can allow users to educate themselves , and is therefore a pretty handy tool for subversion in the grand scheme of things .
Iain Thomson :
It would be hard to argue with the use of open source as a security measure .
Firstly , as Shaun points out , a good knowledge of open source software is very handy , particularly if you can code your own applications and do n’t have to rely on questionable third parties to supply them .
Secondly much of the worlds core infrastructure is run on open source code , and a good knowledge of the systems can reap real benefits in terms of staying off the authorities radar and finding out what you need to know .
Open source may have flaws , as any code will have , but the flaws are few and the benefits are many .
5. Smart behaviour
Iain Thomson :
While operating under an oppressive regime the essence to staying hidden is to work under the radar .
If you 're living in a state that has access to potentially all your online activity then you need to be very smart in how you act .
Long internet sessions are bad security , instead limit activity to a minimum and leave the modem off for long periods to reset the IP address if possible .
Avoid your ISP , and never use the built - in search engine .
Chances are your ISP is state - sponsored and will happily , or at least quickly , hand your data over if requested .
Preserve your anonymity and give out nothing online that you would n't happily see in print the next day in your local newspaper .
Electronic traffic is open to revelation and the use of code is essential .
Nine times out of ten the police talk about the fatal flaw that catches the villain .
In fact there 's a lot more detective work that goes on and it 's usually stupidity that trips people up .
But the smart activist does n't give their enemy any clues if they can and eternal vigilance is the price of liberty .
Shaun Nichols :
While at lunch the other day , we were laughing at the idea that people still need to be told not to crack bomb jokes while in the airport .
But it raised an interesting point in the context of this list - if you want to keep a low profile while amidst a possibly oppressive group , it 's best not to attract too much attention to yourself .
There are many simple , commonsense ways for users to stay out of trouble .
As Iain mentioned , knowing where you are and who can see it is the main idea .
Additionally , not falling for scams and social engineering tricks is also important .
The recent malware infections at Google and Adobe were carried out through " spear phishing " attacks which were specially crafted for each individual user and intended to look like a genuine document from a co-worker .
It is always a good idea to take a close look at any email attachments and to be very weary of unsolicited messages , even those from friends .
This is doubly true if you 're in a country where oppressive authorities may be out to get you .
4. Encryption
Shaun Nichols :
It may be hard to these days , when everything from thumb drives to pizza orders is transmitted as encrypted data , but there was a time when computer encryption tools were considered to be a danger on par with rocket - propelled grenades and automatic weapons .
In World War II , governments learned the importance of cryptography to sending electronic messages and preventing enemies from intercepting them .
The practice of encoding and decoding messages was so important that Great Britain set up the Bletchley Park facility and developed what would later become some of the world 's first computers .
In the decades that followed , cryptography remained a closely - guarded practice that was tightly controlled by governments .
In fact , in the US it was considered illegal to transfer cryptography tools of any sort outside of the country as the technology was classified as " munitions and auxillary military technology . "
Only in 1995 was the ban officially lifted and citizens were allowed to take publically - available encryption tools outside US borders .
The use of encryption to keep governments or dictatorial regimes out is obvious : protect transmissions from being intercepted and prevent the recovery of seized storage drives .
But encryption tools can also be a useful way to keep criminals and data thieves from lifting your info .
Iain Thomson : I would have liked to see encryption higher up the list , of which more later , since it is fundamental to both private and security online activity .
In the 1930s the US all but shut down its encryption and code breaking facilities after US Secretary of State Henry Stimson declared “ gentlemen do n't read other gentlemen 's mail . ”
For the individual user encryption is a must have .
It ’s appalling that it has taken Google so long to encrypt its online apps and I am still gobsmacked by how many companies do n’t bother to encrypt either current data or backups .
Individual who want their email and other data to remain private must also get up and do something about it .
There are plenty of free encryption services out there and every internet user would be advised to make use of them .
3. Mobile phones
Iain Thomson : Mobile phones are both a blessing and a curse to the activist .
On the one hand they provide instant communication and , increasingly video evidence .
But on the other they are easily traceable , the encryption is probably cracked and they are amongst the first things seized by authorities .
Mobile phones are very useful in certain circumstances .
They can be used for instant person to person conversation and man of them come with cameras rivalling most of the handheld camera market .
Those pictures can then be uploaded around the world in seconds .
But there 's a downside .
Due to radio mast triangulation , and increasingly GPS coordinate hacking , mobile phones can actually help pinpoint so - called troublemakers .
Even if a mobile phone is switched off it is detectable and the only way to avoid this is to remove the battery altogether , something not possible for iPhone users .
Mobile communications are essential in a system to beat oppression .
The ability to act fast and be in constant contact cannot be underestimated .
But these useful tools come with responsibilities .
Shaun Nichols :
The next frontier of electronic activism and privacy protection is going to be the mobile phone .
In fact , it already is .
Many security developers and engineers are working on ways to encrypt phone data and ensure that attackers can not compromise the handset .
There is no doubt that mobile phones are incredibly valuable , particularly now that so many have embedded cameras and audio recorders .
However , allow me one small gripe : the provider .
Much like ISPs tend to roll over to government data requests , mobile phone service providers are often all - to - willing to hand over user information , even in cases where the user like poses little to no physical danger to anyone .
It ’s definitely foolish to think that anyone using a cell phone is anonymous these days .
Additionally , there 's the infrastructure issue .
As anyone who has tried to access the mobile broadband networks at a large convention such as CES or CeBit can tell you , when lots of people are gathering and uploading information , the networks can quickly become overwhelmed and the flow of data can slow to a crawl or stop altogether .
2. Blogs
Shaun Nichols : Perhaps it 's the journalist in me , or perhaps it 's the unruly new - world colonist in me , but I consider free speech to be hugely important and I fought long and hard to get this at or near the top of the list .
With the maturation of the web and the growth of site providers , the concept of the blog has exploded in the last decade and become a central element of the web as we know it .
In recent years , the blog has also proven itself as an invaluable tool for giving ordinary citizens a voice and allowing them to speak their minds .
Almost every week it seems we are finding critically important news from some part of the world that is only emerging through blogs .
With state agencies now tightly controlling the press in so many parts of the world , blogs are often the only way that the rest of the planet can find out what 's going on in a region and how the people are truly getting on .
So much effort now is being put into getting computers into remote and impoverished areas of the world .
I believe that shortly after those efforts are established , someone needs to offer a program which gives those same populations free hosting and access to self - publishing tools .
Iain Thomson : Shaun was indeed vociferous in his arguments on this one , but blogs really be this high one wonders .
On one level blogs really have become the new political pamphlet , but with a much wider scope .
If Thomas Paine had been alive today I suspect he would be turning the air blue with purple prose to stir up his readers .
One hopes he would n’t be tempted to add LOL to some of them as well .
The importance of the blogosphere in shaping national moods is growing , and restrictive states are clamping down on bloggers if they do n’t follow the party line .
One of China ’s leading bloggers has said he is giving up because of the constant worry that he might end up in prison for expressing his views .
Blogging is particularly effective in states that control the media .
Since the traditional forms of communication are compromised people automatically look outside at blogs for an alternative slant on what is going on .
They just have to find bloggers they trust .
Here in the West the media poses a different problem , since they are the ones outing anonymous bloggers .
A UK court recently ruled that there was no right to anonymity for bloggers , leading to the shutdown of an informative police blog .
1. Web Proxies
Iain Thomson :
In an age of internet communication anonymity is surely the best tool for those in the business of getting rid of oppression .
A project known as TOR , a military system developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory , was taken over by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and is now being used to shield internet users from repressive regimes around the world .
When the first internet protocols were formed there was little thought of the future that lay before the internet .
There are strong calls for a revision in the basic IP principles to identify users individually .
While this might make life easier to e-commerce they would be a death knell to internet users freedoms .
Anonymity is what makes the internet so much more subversive than Caxton 's press ever was .
In a minute 's post online millions more readers can obtain information than was ever possible under dead tree publishing .
But how people obtain that information has to be safe , and TOR is a valuable tool in being able to do that .
Information on it own is not enough , it has to be accessed freely .
Shaun Nichols : Again , it 's a fallacy for any user to believe that they are completely anonymous online .
When your computer connects to another system , it 's invariably going to leave a trail .
As any hacker worth their salt will tell you , the key is to make that trail as hard to follow as possible .
Going through protected connections and servers is one way to do so , bouncing your connection through numerous proxy systems , making the tracing process tedious and difficult .
The Onion Router , or TOR , uses both of these .
The general idea is that a user 's connection goes through a server which then processes the encrypted connection through a series of proxy servers .
The result is a virtual dead - end for anyone trying to analyse the path a user took .
The ramifications of this are obvious - users can surf the web without being tracked back to their home systems .
Unfortunately , there is also an easy way for oppressive regimes to prevent this : simply use a filter tool at the ISP level to block users from accessing the TOR service .

CALIFORNIA is America 's most populous state and , if independent , would boast the world 's eighth - biggest economy .
It is also often seen as a trailblazer , both within America and beyond .
So on August 31st , when California 's lawmakers approved a measure to cut emissions of the gases that cause global warming , the decision reverberated far beyond the state 's borders .
America has long been a laggard in the fight against global warming .
Soon after becoming president in 2001 , George Bush renounced the Kyoto Protocol , a treaty backed by the United Nations that aims to reduce emissions of the offending greenhouse gases .
Seven north - eastern states are setting up a system to cap and then reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , from power stations .
But before California 's move , no American state had a broad mandatory scheme , of the kind currently operating within the European Union .
Californians have plenty of reasons to fear global warming .
Already , snow is melting earlier in the year in its mountains , causing problems not only for skiers but also for the farmers who rely on steady supplies of melt - water to irrigate their crops .
Some scientists foresee more droughts and forest fires , and higher , stormier and more acidic seas along California 's long coastline .
The state 's voters are a green lot and their representatives have led the country in tightening restrictions on all manner of pollutants , including greenhouse gases .
In 2002 , for example , they passed a law that calls for a gradual reduction in carbon - dioxide emissions from vehicles .
The new law requires a similar phased reduction in emissions from big industrial polluters starting in 2012 .
Firms will have to cut their own emissions , or buy the rights to cuts made by other firms .
By 2020 emissions should be back to the level of 1990 — a less exacting target and timetable than that demanded by the Kyoto Protocol .
The politicians are leaving all the details , including who will do the cutting , how the trading mechanism will work and what the penalties for failure will be , up to the agency that enforces the state 's existing air - pollution standards .
Business lobbyists , who argue that the law will simply prompt gas - belching industries to relocate to more accommodating jurisdictions , and so cost the state jobs and tax revenue , will almost certainly challenge it in court — as they have the law on vehicles .
Even if the law succeeds in reducing emissions as planned , however , it will have little practical effect on global warming .
California , after all , only accounts for about 2 % of the world 's output of greenhouse gases .
The rest of America , and other big sources of emissions , such as China , will remain free to pollute as they please .
But the law 's supporters argue that other places will inevitably regulate greenhouse gases as global warming begins to bite and that Californian businesses will benefit from being in the vanguard of this trend .
California 's politicians certainly hope to benefit from being ahead of the crowd .
They rushed the law through ahead of November 's elections , doubtless in order to campaign on their green credentials .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's governor , who is up for re-election this year , backed the measure despite objections from his fellow Republicans , presumably in the hopes of appealing to the state 's largely Democratic electorate .
Meanwhile , Mr Bush , another embattled Republican , continues to insist that he opposes mandatory emissions - reduction schemes .
But pundits are beginning to wonder whether the same logic that appealed to Mr Schwarzenegger might also convince him .
How better to distract attention from other thornier issues and steal some of the Democrats ' thunder than by unveiling a big environmental initiative ?
