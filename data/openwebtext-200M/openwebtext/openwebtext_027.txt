It was the nightmare many had been expecting .
Five years ago , hard on the heels of 9/11 , someone sent anthrax spores through the US mail to journalists and politicians .
Five people died , and at least 17 more got sick .
The culprit was never caught .
This relatively unsophisticated attack confirmed fears , already growing in the US , that with a bit more effort a determined bioterrorist could spread disease and mayhem across the nation .
To combat the threat , the Bush administration launched an unprecedented biodefence effort .
To date it has spent $ 44 billion – three - quarters of it aimed at protecting civilians – …
It ’s been a long time since I got an overdue notice from the library .
That ’s because it ’s years since I ’ve been to a public library .
The folks at Barnes and Noble are much nicer , and the bathrooms are cleaner too .
So imagine my surprise when a letter arrived from the Queens Borough Public Library announcing they had referred my $ 57 overdue debt to a collections agency !
It was a pretty scary note : “ Notice of non-payment may be made available to credit grantors including car dealers , finance companies , banks , department stores and others …
This adverse information can stay on your record for up to seven years !
Why allow this to happen ? ”
Why indeed ?
I rolled my eyes at the strong - arm tactics , but a debt is a debt , even if its ten years old .
The next day I gave the library a ring .
That ’s when things got weird .
According to the nice lady at the circulation desk , I checked out the book in April , 2006 .
“ But I have n’t been to your library in a decade , ” I told her .
“ I do n’t even live in Queens anymore ! ” I asked her the title .
It turned out to be a children ’s book , written in Spanish : El Hombre Que Aprendio a Ladrar Y Otros Cuentos .
I do n’t speak Spanish , but I ’m guessing that translates as The Man Who Got Screwed Over by the Library .
A few more phones calls lead me to Hong , in the community relations department .
When I explained my situation , she went on the attack : “ You have to tell us when you move , so we can delete your account ! ” Oops .
With all the fuss over renting a new place and hiring movers and packing my belongings ten years ago , I apparently forgot the most important part of any move : calling the library .
Hong went on to suggest that it was up to me to clear my name .
“ You need proof .
Show us documents , ” she said .
Next I tried the collections agency , Unique Management Services .
This fine Jefferson , Indiana company works exclusively with public libraries , it turns out , breaking the kneecaps of past - due scofflaws on behalf of more than 300 lending operations across the country .
According to this article in USAToday , it collected more than $ 7 million for the Queens Library in 2004 .
I got a pretty good idea why the revenue is flowing in after explaining my situation to Karen , the Unique manager on my account : “ I ’m sorry you feel that way , ” she said sweetly .
“ But we are only doing what the library asks . ”
I faxed over my drivers license to prove I do n’t even live in Queens , but did n’t hear back .
It ’s a pretty good racket : contact the library patrons , tell them you ’ll ruin their credit if they do n’t pay up , and assume they ’re guilty until they prove themselves innocent .
My only consolation is that both the library and the collection agency might be full of it .
When I called credit scoring company Fair Isaac to find out if the library could really ruin my credit , the rep burst out laughing and chided me for falling prey to what he referred to as the library Nazis .
“ That ’s a crazy ridiculous thing , ” he said .
“ I have yet to a derogatory mark from any credit union pertaining to the library . ”
Hope he ’s right !

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
This will bring little comfort to the 60 million members of the French nation , but Italy 's World Cup victory Sunday was the best possible outcome for the world economy , as it stands to do more than a win by any of the other competing countries would have done to correct global imbalances .
That 's the thesis of Dutch banking group ABN Amro , which expects the win to add 10 to 15 basis points to Italian economic growth in 2006 , as a boost in confidence spills over into higher consumption and investment .
" We were n't really expecting Italy to win , but we do still believe it's the best result for the world economy , " said economist Ruben van Leeuwen , co-author of ABN Amro's March report " Soccernomics , " in which the bank first evaluated the macroeconomic and stock - market impact of a World Cup win .
The bank found that past figures show economic growth among soccer world champions outstrips growth in the losing finalist country , with an average " bonus " of 0.7 % additional economic growth versus the prior year 's gain .
The losing country -- this year , France -- tends to suffer an average 0.3 % loss compared with the previous year 's growth .
Since 1970 there have been two major exceptions to the winner - takes - all rule , said van Leeuwen and report co-author Charles Kalshoven .
In 1974 and 1978 , the report recalled , the German and Argentine economies , respectively , experienced sharp downturns -- in the case of Argentina , a deep recession -- after the national teams brought home the World Cup .
Champion countries ' stock markets have also outperformed in the year of the victory , based on the last three World Cups , with an average positive return of 10 % for the world champion and a negative return of 25 % for the losing finalist , according to ABN Amro .
“ Stock markets in World Cup - winning countries have posted an average positive return of 10 % in the years of the past three tournaments .
The losing finalist countries ' markets have fallen 25 % on average . ”
Brazil , the winner in the last World Cup in 2002 , has done nicely since it beat Germany in Yokohama , Japan , according to a recent note from Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs .
The Brazilian stock market has gained about 260 % since its 2002 win , while losing finalist Germany 's stock market is up a more modest 51 % .
Italy 's stock market has also gained about 51 % since 2002 .
Italy 's benchmark S&P / MIB index did n't exactly rally Monday , closing up just 0.4 % .
The index has gained 2.5 % in the year to date .
In fact , the French CAC - 40 index performed better , adding 0.6 % to 4,982 for a 5.7 % gain in the year so far .
But in Milan , famed Turin football club Juventus ( 033651 ) outperformed , adding 6.9 % .
Those gains were partly because the players from the World Cup squad have increased their value through their win but also because the euphoria across the nation has led to hopes that a magistrate will be more lenient in penalizing the club in an ongoing game - rigging scandal .
See archived story .
So why is Italy 's victory so good for the world economy ?
Firstly , because it 's good for Europe , which has lagged economic growth rates in Asia , the U.S. and Latin America over the past few years .
Stronger domestic demand within Europe would boost exports from those other regions .
That in turn would help the U.S. shrink its crippling current - account deficit without too much economic damage -- the idea being that higher demand from Europe would offset weaker demand at home .
The U.S. deficit currently equates to an unsustainable 7 % of gross domestic product , and the danger is that the eventual correction could be sharp and sudden , pushing the dollar sharply lower , sending U.S. rates higher and tipping the U.S. economy into a painful recession .
That scenario would pose a danger to the rest of the world 's economy .
An acceleration in European growth would also offer an attractive alternative investment opportunity to Asian investors , who are placing most of their money in dollars at the moment , further correcting imbalances .
Within Europe , Italy was tapped as the best country to win because its economy , while major , is often called " the sick man of Europe . "
In 2005 its GDP grew just 0.1 % , although it had been expected to fare better this year -- even absent a favorable World Cup result .
" The Italian economy is hampered by an inflexible labor market and deteriorating competitiveness , " said the ABN Amro report .
" An Italian victory in the World Cup final would boost consumer and producer confidence , and thus lead to more spending and investment .
' Made in Italy ' would also reap more benefits abroad .
This may well push economic growth upwards , which would then give the government scope to introduce economic reforms . "
Germany may have lost the final , but it stands to benefit from its role as host nation , which has given a lift to the hospitality industry .
" There 's direct and indirect effects , but it 's also good for ' Brand Germany ' in terms of the exposure it 's brought , " said van Leeuwen .
The German Xetra DAX closed today up 0.4 % at 5,706.32 .
The index has gained 5.5 % in the year to date .
INCOME tax has been paid in Britain for more than two centuries .
First introduced by William Pitt the Younger to finance the war against Napoleonic France , it is the Treasury 's biggest source of revenue , raising 30 % of tax receipts .
It arouses strong political emotions , regarded as fair by some because it makes the rich pay a bigger share of their income than the poor , but unfair by others because it penalises enterprise and hard work .
During the past 30 years , income tax has been subject to sweeping changes , notably the cut in the top rate from 98 % to 40 % under Margaret Thatcher between 1979 and 1988 .
Now another Conservative politician , George Osborne , is floating a radical reform to match that earlier exploit .
The shadow chancellor announced on September 7th that he was setting up a commission to explore the possible introduction of a flat tax in Britain .
Mr Osborne 's big new idea stems in part from frustration at the Conservative party 's failure to win votes on tax in the past two elections .
Their proposal to cut taxes by £ 4 billion ( $ 7.4 billion ) a year did them few favours at the polls in May .
Such a paltry reduction in a trillion - pound economy seemed an apology of a policy .
By contrast , the introduction of a flat tax would be a radical step .
The reform is already being tried elsewhere .
Mr Osborne first expressed interest in the flat tax after a visit in June to Estonia , which introduced it in 1994 .
Since then eight other countries in eastern and central Europe have followed suit .
Poland appears likely to adopt a flat income tax .
Even Germany is flirting with the idea ( see article ) .
Introducing a flat income tax into Britain would involve two main changes .
At present , there are three marginal tax rates .
The first £ 2,090 of taxable income is taxed at 10 % ; the next £ 30,310 is taxed at the basic rate of 22 % ; and income above that is taxed at the higher rate of 40 % .
These three rates would be replaced by a single rate , which would be considerably lower than the current top rate .
At the same time there would be an increase in the tax - free personal allowance , currently worth £ 4,895 .
Flat - tax proponents say that the reform would yield many economic benefits .
If it were combined with an assault on other tax reliefs , then it would simplify a tax system that is groaning with complexity .
The latest edition of “ Tolley 's Yellow Tax Handbook ” , which contains all direct - tax legislation for 2005 - 06 , runs to four weighty volumes and has roughly doubled in length since Gordon Brown became chancellor of the exchequer in 1997 .
Only this week , Mr Brown was upbraided by a parliamentary committee for the complex “ nightmare ” of his system of tax credits , designed to help poorer families .
Another advantage is that reform could sweep a lot of low - paid people out of income tax altogether .
In the past eight years under Labour , the number of income - tax payers has risen from 26.2 m to 30.5 m .
Over the same period , the number of higher - rate taxpayers has risen from 2.1 m to 3.6 m .
Flat - tax fans also think that it could trigger a new economic dynamism , as people respond to the enhanced incentive to work harder .
The more this happens , the more the reform could pay for itself as a bigger economy generates more tax revenues .
So much for the economic case for a flat tax .
What of its politics ?
One obvious objection is that the reform would be unfair , since the richer would pay less tax than they do at present .
Advocates of a flat tax make two rejoinders .
First , an income - tax system with a single rate remains progressive — the rich pay a higher proportion of their income than the poor — as long as it is combined with a tax - free allowance .
Second , the rich can exploit current complexities to avoid taxes in ways that could be curtailed in a flat - tax system .
But could a flat tax be introduced without there being losers ?
A recent paper from the Adam Smith Institute suggested that this would indeed be possible .
Richard Teather , its author , proposed a flat - rate tax of 22 % , the present basic rate , with a tax - free personal allowance of £ 12,000 , more than double the current one .
“ All taxpayers would be better off under the reform , ” he argued .
However , the proposal has an obvious flaw .
As Mr Teather himself admits , it would result in an initial loss in revenue of £ 50 billion a year .
That is over a third of the total income - tax receipts of £ 138 billion that the Treasury expects this year ; and a tenth of all government revenues .
Unless public spending were slashed , other taxes would have to rise to meet this shortfall .
So a more realistic simulation of the impact of a flat tax is to make it revenue - neutral .
The Economist asked John Hawksworth , an economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers , an accountancy firm , to calculate what that might involve .
He said the current yield of income tax could be preserved with a flat rate of 30 % and a personal allowance of £ 10,000 .
We also asked Mr Hawksworth to estimate what impact such a reform would have on income - tax payers .
Under this revenue - neutral approach , there would be losers as well as winners compared with current tax bills ( see chart ) .
Those who would gain are low - earners as well as high - fliers .
For example , someone on £ 10,000 would gain 8.7 % of their income ; someone on £ 100,000 would gain 5 % of their income .
Those who would lose are in the middle , with losses peaking at 3.5 % of income at the current higher - rate threshold of £ 37,295 .
In all , more than 10 m income - tax payers — a third of the present number — would lose from such a reform .
Clearly , different combinations of allowance and tax rate would generate different results .
But the general pattern would remain the same .
“ If you raise the same revenue but increase the allowance , then it is the people in the middle of the income tax paying population that lose from a flat tax , ” says Christopher Heady , head of tax policy at the OECD .
This finding is politically awkward for the Tories .
Unless a flat income tax were financed by big increases in other taxes , it is difficult to see how it could realistically be introduced without exacting a lot of pain among middling earners .
Yet their votes will be crucial if the Conservatives are to stand any chance at the next election .
The flat tax is an arresting idea — and politically attractive because it gives the Tories a platform to attack Labour 's itch to meddle with the tax code — but it does not get the Conservatives off the hook .
Mr Osborne wants lower and simpler taxes .
However , he will be able to achieve that goal only if he can work out a convincing set of proposals to cut public spending .
X Selections , Cut Buffers , and Kill Rings .
© 1997 , 2002 by Jamie Zawinski < jwz@jwz.org >
This document began as a description of how Emacs and XEmacs deal with copying and pasting text under X11 .
However , I 've noticed that a lot of people are being referred here to answer more general questions of how copying and pasting work under X , or , more specifically , how they should implement copying and pasting in their own X applications .
So allow me to summarize ...
Selections : X11 has these things called ``selections . ''
They have names .
There are really only two you need to know about : the Primary selection and the Clipboard selection .
An application is said to ``own '' a selection when it raises its hand and says , ``I have the Primary selection now . ''
Only one application can own a selection at a time , so when one app asserts selection ownership , the previous owner loses it .
Asserting ownership of a selection does n't actually transfer data .
When you want to copy text from application A to application B , it goes like this :
Copy text in program A : program A asserts selection ownership .
Paste text in program B : program B notes that program A owns the selection .
program B asks A for the text .
program A responds , and sends the text to program B .
program B pastes the response .
X10 had these things called ``Cut Buffers '' that were a more limited and wasteful predecessor to selections .
They are obsolete ; do n't use them .
Some applications ( like xterm ) still have legacy support for them , but ignore that .
Clipboard : for when the user has explicitly copied something ( e.g. , the ``Edit / Copy ' ' menu item . )
Primary : more ephemeral and implicit : it is for when the user has highlighted or selected something ( e.g. , dragging the mouse over some text . )
Cut Buffers : Obsolete .
Never , ever , ever use them .
Ever. Copy and Paste : Contrary to what you may have come to believe , copying and pasting text under X11 works pretty much exactly the same way it does under MacOS and Windows .
Really .
It works like this :
Select the text to copy ;
Pull down the ``Edit '' menu and select ``Copy . ''
This causes the text to become the Clipboard Selection .
This causes the text to become the Clipboard Selection .
In another window , pull down the ``Edit '' menu and select ``Paste . ''
This causes the current value of the Clipboard selection to be inserted .
But what about the middle mouse button ?
It happens that X11 programs have a second way of copying and pasting text that is orthogonal to the Edit / Copy way described above .
This causes confusion , because some people mix the two up .
Here 's how the other way works :
Select the text to copy .
This causes the text to become the Primary Selection .
This causes the text to become the Primary Selection .
In another window , click the middle mouse button .
This causes the current value of the Primary selection to be inserted .
So how do I implement this ?
Event : Action : text highlighted
with mouse Assert PRIMARY selection ownership .
Edit / Copy
Make an internal copy of the highlighted text .
Assert CLIPBOARD selection ownership .
Edit / Paste Retrieve and insert CLIPBOARD selection .
middle button paste ,
if implemented Retrieve and insert PRIMARY selection .
another app asks
for PRIMARY
Send currently - highlighted text , if any .
another app asks
for CLIPBOARD
Send saved copy of last - copied text , if any .
another app becomes
PRIMARY owner De-highlight text .
another app becomes
CLIPBOARD owner Discard text copy .
Extra Credit : Content Negotiation
One of the really cool , yet rarely used , features of the selection mechanism is that it can negotiate what data formats to use .
It 's not just about text .
When one application asks another for the selection , part of their communication involves the requester asking the owner for the list of types in which they are capable of delivering the selection data ; then the requester picks the format they like best , and asks for it that way .
As a simple example , suppose there is a program displaying text in multiple fonts .
When pasting that into a text - only program , you 'd want to paste only the text .
But when pasting that into a word processor , you 'd want to keep the font information : if both applications spoke HTML , they could use that as the intermediate format by which they transferred the data .
More complex things are possible , too : for example , when an image is selected on a web page , the web page displayer could offer to serve that up as raw image bits ; or as JPEG data ; or as the original URL of the image .
When trying to copy and paste an image into a text editor that can't do images , the text editor might decide that the next best thing would be to paste the filename of the image , or the URL .
The content negotiation mechansim is very powerful , and I wish more applications would take advantage of it .
You can experiment with content negotiation with other apps from an XEmacs lisp - interaction buffer .
To see what types an app will convert its selection to , make a selection in that app , and then type : ( get-selection - internal ' PRIMARY ' TARGETS ) ==> [ TARGETS TIMESTAMP TEXT STRING LENGTH FILE_NAME OWNER_OS HOST_NAME USER CLASS NAME CLIENT_WINDOW PROCESS COMPOUND_TEXT ]
( get- selection - internal ' PRIMARY ' FILE_NAME ) == > " https://www.jwz.org/doc/x-cut-and-paste.html "
ICCCM : The full technical documentation for this stuff is in the X11R6 Inter - Client Communication Conventions Manual , section 2 : ``Peer - to - Peer Communication by Means of Selections . ''
And now , about Emacs :

Newsgroups : comp.emacs Subject : Re : x-selection / kill - ring interaction
> Emacs : ( car kill - ring ) is always the same as the primary x selection , > therefore mouse2 and C-y pastes the same .
mouse1 sets the > kill - ring as well as the primary selection .
Unless things have changed since the last time I checked , I do n't believe this is true : ( car kill - ring ) is the same as the primary X selection only if a kill has been made in FSFmacs more recently than text has been selected in another ( non-FSFmacs ) X application .

( Actually , RMS asked me > this question ) .
prominent fashion designers in the U.S. are pushing for federal legislation that would offer three years of copyright - like protection for designs ranging from dresses and shoes to belts and eyeglass frames .
Perhaps the most important ideas of all are meta-ideas .
These are ideas about how to support the production and transmission of other ideas .
The British invented patents and copyrights in the seventeenth century .
North Americans invented the agricultural extension service in the nineteenth century and peer - reviewed competitive grants for basic research in the twentieth century .... [ T ]he country that takes the lead in the twenty - first century will be the one that implements an innovation that supports the production of commercially relevant ideas in the private sector .
It is common to argue that intellectual property in the form of copyright and patent is necessary for the innovation and creation of ideas and inventions such as machines , drugs , computer software , books , music , literature and movies .
In fact intellectual property is not like ordinary property at all , but constitutes a government grant of a costly and dangerous private monopoly over ideas .
We show through theory and example that intellectual monopoly is not necessary for innovation and as a practical matter is damaging to growth , prosperity and liberty .
In an article titled Can Fashion Be Copyrighted ? in today 's Wall Street Journal , I learn : The designers ' goal is to stop cheap imitations of their work .
The proposal raises an important question :
To what degree should the government protect creative activity by awarding property rights to creators ?
Most economists , I believe , agree with Paul Romer According to this conventional view , patents and copyrights reward creative activity , promote growth , and enhance welfare , even at the cost of creating some temporary monopoly power .
Economists Michele Boldrin and David Levine , however , argue the opposite view in a forthcoming book Against Intellectual Monopoly :
When I was chatting with Michele about these ideas a few months back , I asked him if he would mind if I published their book , keeping the profits for myself .
He demurred .
Until the system is changed , he wants to keep the rights to his own intellectual property ( but you can read the book for free online ) .
Beyond the question of whether intellectual property deserves legal protection , there is the question of which creations deserve protection and which should immediately enter the public domain .
Should economist John
Hicks get a royalty every time someone teaches the IS - LM model he developed ?
Presumably not .
But drawing a bright line is not easy , as the fashion designers ' proposal illustrates .
Water , the only indispensable ingredient of life , is just about the most versatile stuff on Earth .
Depending on its temperature we can heat our homes with it , bathe in it , and even strap on skates and glide across it , to name only the most common of its many forms .
When subjected to high pressures , however , water can take any of more than 15 different forms .
Researchers have now used x-rays to dissociate water at high pressure to form a solid mixture -- an alloy - - of molecular oxygen and molecular hydrogen .
The work , by a multi-institutional team that includes Russell Hemley and Ho-kwang Mao of Carnegie 's Geophysical Laboratory , appears in the October 27 issue of Science .
The researchers subjected a sample of water to extremely high pressures -- about 170,000 times the pressure at sea level ( 17 Gigapascals ) -- using a diamond anvil , and zapped it with high - energy x-rays .
Under these conditions , nearly all the water molecules split apart and re-formed into a solid alloy of O 2 and H 2 .
X - radiation proved to be the key to cleaving the O - H bonds in water ; without it , the water remained in a high - pressure form of ice known as ice VII - - one of at least 15 such variants of ice that exist under high pressure and variable temperature conditions .
" We managed to hit on just the right level of x - ray energy input , " explained Hemley .
" Any higher , and the radiation tends to pass right through the sample .
Any lower , and the radiation is largely absorbed by the diamonds in our pressure apparatus . "
This rather narrow range of energy requirement explains why , in hundreds of previous high - pressure x-ray experiments , the breakdown reaction had gone undiscovered : most such experiments tend to use more energetic x-rays .
The experiments also required long , multiple - hour irradiation with x-rays ; such long exposures had not been attempted before .
The researchers put the alloy through its paces , subjecting it to a range of pressure , temperature , and bombardment with x-ray and laser radiation .
As long as the sample remained under pressure equivalent to about 10,000 times atmospheric pressure at sea level ( 1 Gigapascal ) , it stood up to this punishment .
Although the substance is clearly a crystalline solid , more experiments are needed to determine its precise crystal structure .
" The new radiation chemistry at high pressure was surprising , " said lead author Wendy Mao of Los Alamos National Laboratory .
" The new alloy containing the incompatible oxygen and hydrogen molecules will be a highly energetic material . "

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has led a pep rally for a $ 7 billion highway project that will loop around the Dallas - Fort Worth metropolitan area , but is being opposed by landowners who will see their private property taken by the state .
A report on KWTX said the tollway to be built by the Spanish - based Cinta - Zachry consortium is part of an " ambitious " $ 184 billion plan for a network of superhighway transportation corridors around the state .
Those , in turn , are expected to be part of the nationwide network of NATFA superhighways that are planned to run from Mexico to Canada , dividing the United States into economic and social districts .
The rally in DeSoto featured handshakes among local government officials who say they have sought the project for some time , over the opposition of property owners whose land would be taken for the massive project .
Staff members for the state Department of Transportation are working to compile and evaluate the comments that were submitted at the dozens of public hearings on the project where residents could ask questions and register opinions , the report said .
A decision from the Federal Highway Administration on environmental concerns is expected in 2007 .
This portion of the superhighways complex is expected to run east of Interstate 35 , promoters said in the report .
The Cintra - Zachry consortium already has been given a contract by the state for the first portion of what is expected to be a 4,000 - mile network of quarter - mile - wide transportation corridors across Texas , the report said .
Up to six separate passenger vehicle lanes , with another four for trucks , two high speed passenger rail tracks , two more for freight trains and a variety of other features are planned .
Cintra partnered with the San Antonio - based Zachry Construction to make plans for the work , the report said .
Cintra plans to spend $ 6 billion on the first portion of the corridor and plans to pay the state $ 1.2 billion and then will have the right to run the road and charge tolls for 50 years , plans show .
In what has become a battle between environmentalists , sportsmen and recreation advocates , a proposal to revert back to 2001 policies regarding our National Parks is in the works .
A reversal on an earlier Bush Administration proposal to allow more commercialization and motorized recreation in the parks seems to be headed for reality .
Greg Mumm , executive director of the BlueRibbon Coalition has this to say : " It 's a sad day for recreation .
There is a big difference between conservation and preservation " .
On the flip - side , Kristen Brengel of the Wilderness Society tells us : " If you 're going to allow a certain activity in a national park , you 're going to have to prove that the activity is n't just going to not damage resources , but not disrupt the visitor atmosphere .
" Senators are welcoming the new plan as a step in the right direction for America 's natural resources .
Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) states : " " The National Park Service has proved to be a good listener , and Interior Secretary Kempthorne is therefore off to a good start " .
Under the new policy , snowmobilers and all - terrain vehicle enthusiasts will have a tougher time getting permission to ride in national parks , although Maureen Healey , executive director of the Personal Watercraft Industry Association , said her group supports the new draft .
Recent scientific studies on the use of personal watercraft at 15 national parks " have all have determined that personal watercraft present no unique impact and should be allowed where other motorboating is allowed , " Healey said .
It 's one of the first policy decisions made by new Interior Secretary Dirk Kemphorne .
A draft of the new policy stresses that when there 's a conflict over preserving or using natural and historical places , conservation will still be the parks ' top priority .
I complained before about bad guides to improve the performance of your website .
digg it , add to delicious
I 'd like to give you a more realistic guide on how to achieve the goal .
I have written my master thesis in computer sciences on this topic and will refer to it throughout the guide .
1. Determine the bottleneck
When you want to improve the speed of your website , you feel that it 's somehow slow .
There are various points that can affect the performance of your page .
Here are the most common ones .
Before we move on , you should always remember that you answer each question with your target audience in mind .
1.1 . File Size
How much data is the user required to load before ( s ) he can use the page .
It is a frequent question , how much data your web page is allowed to have .
You cannot answer this unless you know your target audience .
In the early years of the internet one would suggest a size of 30 k max for the whole page ( including images , etc. ) .
Now that many people have a broadband connection , I think we can push the level to a value between 60 k and 100k .
Although , you should consider lowering the size if you also target modem users .
Still , the less data you require to download , the faster your page will appear .
1.2 . Latency
The time it takes between your request to the server and when the data reaches your PC .
This time adds together from twice the network latency ( which depends on the uplink of the hosting provider , the geographical distance between server and user , and some other factors ) and the time it takes until the server produces the output .
Network latency can hardly be optimized without moving the server , so this guide will not cover this .
The processing time of the server combines complex time factors and contains most often much room for improvement .
2. Reducing the file size
First , you need to know how large your page really is .
There are some useful tools out there .
I picked Web Page Analyzer which does a nice job at this .
I suggest not spending too much time on this , unless your page size is larger than 100 kb .
So skip to step 3 .
Large page sizes are nowadays often caused by large JavaScript libraries .
Often you only need a small part of their functionality , so you could use a cut - down version of it .
For example when using prototype.js just for Ajax , you could use pt.ajax.js ( also see moo.ajax ) , or the moo.fx as a script.aculo.us replacement .
Digg for example used to have about 290 kb , they now have reduced the size to 160 kb by leaving out unnecessary libraries .
Also large images can cause large file sizes , this is often caused by the wrong image format .
A rule of thumb : JPG for photos , PNG for most other aspects , especially if plain colors are involved .
Also : use PNG for screen shots , JPGs are not only larger but also look ugly .
You can also use GIF instead of PNG when the image has only few colors and / or you want to create an animation .
Also often large images are scaled via the HTML width and height attributes .
You should do this in your graphical editor and scale it there .
This will also reduce the size .
Old HTML style can also cause large file size .
There is no need for thousands of tags anymore .
Use XHTML and CSS !
A further important step to smaller size is on - the - fly compressing of your content .
Almost all browsers already support gzip compression .
For an Apache 2 web server , for example , there is the mod_deflate module can do this transparently for you .
If you do n't have access to your server 's configuration , you can use the zlib for PHP or for Django ( Python ) there is GZipMiddleware , Ruby on Rails has a gzip plugin , too .
Beware of compressing JavaScript , there are quite some bugs with Internet Explorer .
And for heaven 's sake , you can also strip the white space after you 've completed the previous steps .
3 . Check what 's causing a high latency
As mentioned , the latency can be caused by two large factors .
3.1 . Is it the network latency ?
To determine whether the network latency is the blocking factor you can ping your server .
This can be done from the command line via the command ping servername.com
If your server admin has disabled the pinging function you can also use a traceroute which uses another method to determine the time tracert servername.com ( Windows ) or traceroute servername.com ( Unix ) .
If you address an audience that is geographically not very close to you , you can also use a service such as Just Ping which pings the given address from 12 different locations in the world .
3.2 . Does it take too long to generate the page ?
If the ping times are ok , it might take too long to generate the page .
Note that this applies to dynamic pages , for example written in a scripting language such as PHP .
Static pages are usually served very quickly .
You can measure the time it takes to generate the page quite easily .
You just need to save an time stamp at the beginning of the page and subtract it from the time stamp when the page has been generated .
For example in PHP you do it like this ( due to technical restrictions a space is inserted before the question mark ) :
< ?php // Start of the Page $ start_time = explode ( ' ' , microtime ( ) ) ; $ start_time = $ start_time [ 1 ] + $ start_time [ 0 ] ; ?>
and at the end of the page :
< ?php $ end_time = explode (' ' , microtime ( ) ) ; $ total_time = $ end_time [ 0 ] + $ end_time [ 1 ] - $ start_time ; printf ( ' Page loaded in %.3 f seconds . ' , $ total_time ) ; ?>
The time needed to generate the page is now displayed at the bottom of it .
You can also compare the time between loading a static page ( often a file ending in .html ) and a dynamic one .
I 'd advise to use the first method because you are going to need that method to go on optimizing the page .
You can also use a Profiler which usually offers even more information on the generation process .
For PHP you can , as a first easy step , enable Output Buffering and restart the test .
Also you should consider testing your page with a benchmarking program such as ApacheBench ( ab ) .
This will stress the server via requesting several copies at once .
It is difficult to say what time suffices for generating a web page .
It depends on your own requirements .
You should try to keep the generation time under 1 second , as this is a delay which users usually can cope with .
3.3 . Is it the rendering performance ?
This plays only a minor role in my guide , but still this can be a reason why your page takes long to load .
If you use a complex table structure ( which can render slowly ) , you most probably are using old style HTML , try to switch to XHTML and CSS .
Do n't use overly complex JavaScript , like slow scripts in combination with onmousemove events make a page real sluggish .
If your JavaScript makes the page load slowly ( you can use a similar technique as the PHP time measuring , using the ( new Date ( ) ) .getMilliseconds ( ) ) , you are doing something wrong .
Rethink your concept .
4. Determine the lagging component (s )
As your page usually consists of more than one component ( such as header , login window , navigation , footer , etc. ) you should next check which one needs tuning .
You can do this by integrating a few of the measuring fragments to the page which will show you several split times throughout the page .
The following steps can now be applied to the slowest parts of the page .
5. Enable a Compiler Cache
Scripting languages recompile their script upon each request .
As there are far more requests to the unchanged script , it makes no sense to compile the script over and over ( especially when core development has finished ) .
For PHP there is amongst others APC ( which will probably be integrated with PHP 6 ) , Python stores a compiled version by itself .
6. Look at the DB Queries
At university most complex queries with lots of JOINs and GROUPs are taught , but in real life it can often be useful to avoid JOINs between ( especially large ) tables .
Instead you do multiple selects which can be cached by the SQL server .
This is especially true if you do n't need the joined data for every row .
It really depends on your application , but trying without a JOIN is often worth it .
Ensure that you use query folding ( also called query cache ; such as the MySQL Query Cache ) .
Because in a web environment the same SELECT statements are executed over and over .
This almost screams for a cache ( and explains why avoiding JOINs can be much faster ) .
7 . Send the correct Modification Data
Dynamic
Web pages often make one big mistake :
They do n't have their date of last modification set .
This means that the browser always has to load the whole page from the server and cannot use its cache .
In HTTP there are various headers important for caching : for 1.0 there is the Last - Modified header which plays together with the browser - sent If - Modified - Since ( see specification ) .
HTTP 1.1 uses the ETag ( so called Entity Tag ) which allows different last modification dates for the same page ( e.g. for different languages ) .
Other relevant headers are Cache - Control and Expires .
Read on about how to set the headers correctly and respond to them ( 1.0 ) and 1.1 .
8. Consider Component Caching ( advanced )
If optimizing the database does not improve your generation time enough , you are most likely doing something complex ;)
So for public pages it 's very likely that you will present two users with the same content ( at least for a specific component ) .
So instead of doing complex database queries , you can store a pre-rendered copy and use that when needed , to save time .
This is a rather complex topic but can be the ultimate solution to your performance problems .
You need to make sure that you do n't deliver a stale copy to the client , you need think about how to organize your cache files so you can invalidate them quickly .
Most web frameworks give you a hand when doing component caching : for PHP there is Smarty 's template caching , Perl has Mason 's Data Caching , Ruby 's Rails has Page Caching , Django supports it as well .
This technique can eventually lead to a result when loading your page does not need any request to the data base .
This can be a favorable result as a connection to the database is often the most obvious bottleneck .
If your page is not that complex you could also consider just caching the whole page .
This is easier but makes the page usually feel less up - to - date .
One more thing :
If you have enough RAM you should also consider storing the cache files in a RAM drive .
As the data is discardable ( as it can be re-generated at any time ) a loss when rebooting would not matter .
Keeping disk I / O low can boost the speed once again .
9. Reducing the Server Load
Consider that your page loads quickly and everything looks alright , but when too many users access the page , it suddenly becomes slow .
This is most likely due to a lack of resources on the server .
You cannot add an indefinite amount of CPU power or RAM into the server but you can handle what you 've got more carefully .
9.1 . Use a Reverse Proxy ( needs access to the server )
Whenever a request needs to be handled , a whole copy ( or child process ) of the web server executable needs to be held in memory .
Not only for the time of generating the page but also until the page has been transferred to the client .
Slow clients can cost performance .
When you have many users connecting , you can be sure that quite a few slow ones will block the line for somebody else just for transferring back the data .
So there is a solution for this .
The well known Squid proxy has a HTTP Acceleration mode which handles communication with the client .
It 's like a secretary that handles all communication .
It waits patiently until the client has filed his request .
Asks the web server to respond , quickly receives the response ( while the web server can move on to the next request ) and then will patiently return the file to the client .
Also the Squid server is small , lightweight , and specialized for that task .
Therefore you need less RAM for more clients which allows a higher throughput ( regarding served clients per time unit ) .
9.2 . Take a lightweight HTTP Server ( needs access to the server )
Often people also say that Apache is quite huge and does not do it 's work quickly enough .
Personally I am satisfied with its performance , but when it comes to dealing with scripting languages that handle their web server communication via the ( fast ) CGI interface , Apache is easily trumped by a lightweight alternative .
It 's called LightTPD ( pronounced " lighty " ) and does a good job at doing that special task very quickly .
You can already see from a configuration file that it keeps things simple .
I suggest testing both scenarios if you gain from using LightTPD or if you should stay with your old web server .
The Apache Web Server is stable and is built on long lasting experience in the web server business , but LightTPD is taking it 's chance .
10 . Server Scaling ( extreme technique )
Once you have gone through all steps and your page still does not load fast enough ( most obvious because of too many concurrent users ) , you can now duplicate your hardware .
Because of the previous steps there is n't too much work left .
The Reverse Proxy can act as a load balancer by sending its requests to one of the web servers , either quite - randomly ( Round Robin ) or server load driven .
Conclusion
All in all you can say that the main strategy for a large page is a combination of caching and intelligent handling of the resources helps you reach the goal .
While the first 7 steps apply to any page , the last 3 points are usually only useful ( and needed ) at sites with many concurrent users .
The guide shows that you do n't need a special server to withstand slashdotting or digging .

" Rather than come clean about their mistake , they helped launch the United States into a bloody war that would last for 10 years , " Mr. Aid said .
Asked about Mr. Hanyok 's research , an N.S.A. spokesman said the agency intended to release his 2001 article in late November .
The spokesman , Don Weber , said the release had been " delayed in an effort to be consistent with our preferred practice of providing the public a more contextual perspective . "
Mr. Weber said the agency was working to declassify not only Mr. Hanyok 's article , but also the original intercepts and other raw material for his work , so the public could better assess his conclusions .
The intelligence official gave a different account .
He said N.S.A. historians began pushing for public release in 2002 , after Mr. Hanyok included his Tonkin Gulf findings in a 400 - page , in - house history of the agency and Vietnam called " Spartans in Darkness . "
Though superiors initially expressed support for releasing it , the idea lost momentum as Iraq intelligence was being called into question , the official said .
Mr. Aid said he had heard from other intelligence officials the same explanation for the delay in releasing the report , though neither he nor the intelligence official knew how high up in the agency the issue was discussed .
A spokesman for Gen. Michael V. Hayden , who was the agency's .
director until last summer and is now the principal deputy director of national intelligence , referred questions to Mr. Weber , the N.S.A. spokesman , who said he had no further information .
Many historians believe that even without the Tonkin Gulf episode , Johnson might have found a reason to escalate military action against North Vietnam .
They note that Johnson apparently had his own doubts about the Aug. 4 attack and that a few days later told George W. Ball , the under secretary of state , " Hell , those dumb , stupid sailors were just shooting at flying fish ! "
But Robert S. McNamara , who as defense secretary played a central role in the Tonkin Gulf affair , said in an interview last week that he believed the intelligence reports had played a decisive role in the war 's expansion .
Russia 's presidency of the G8 has certainly started with a bang .
Vladimir Putin had barely taken over from Tony Blair on January 1 before he was turning off gas supplies to Ukraine in a row over the price of energy .
Putin received thunderous condemnation for this decision .
Commentators vied to find the right words to describe this display of old - style Moscow muscle .
It was quite outrageous that Russia should bully Ukraine , punishing Kiev for daring to go against the Kremlin 's wishes in last year 's Orange Revolution .
Of course , Putin 's argument that he was simply asking Ukraine to pay a market price for its gas was spurious .
Belarus - a client state of Moscow - is continuing to get its gas at the hugely subsidised price of $ 50 ( £ 28 ) per 1,000 cubic metres , and increases for the Baltic states and Moldova are being phased in over time ( as will Ukraine 's , now the two sides reached an agreement ) .
There was an element of spite in Putin 's action ; no doubt about it .
The message was clear : do n't mess with me .
But for the west to raise its hands in horror is utter humbug .
The implication is that Britain , France and the US never reward friendly countries nor punish those they believe have stepped out of line .
As Paul Robinson noted in last week 's Spectator , Egypt is seen as a friend of the west in the Middle East and gets plenty of financial help ; Syria is no friend of Washington and receives less generous treatment .
" Putin 's policy certainly represents a very crude pursuit of national interest , implemented unilaterally and with little regard for international opinion .
But , as such , it is not so very different from the sort of policies pursued by other states , including our own .
Furthermore , the marketisation of energy policy which it involves is entirely in keeping with the demands that European states have been making of Russia for several years . "
Quite .
If Putin has decided that the way to secure global influence is to throw his weight around , who can blame him ?
That 's what everybody else does .
And given Moscow was crawling with neo-liberal zealots in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 insisting a dose of unrestrained market forces was just what the doctor ordered , it must be amusing for Putin to be able to say : " What , me ?
I 'm only doing what the market tells me I should . "
In this case , the market - forces argument carries some clout .
Energy prices are high globally because demand is strong and there are justifiable concerns about supply in the short and medium - term .
It is absurdly wasteful and damaging to the environment for the Russians to sell gas at subsidised prices .
From the perspective of anybody concerned about global warming , the idea that Ukraine should be receiving gas at one - fifth of the price it costs in western Europe and an eighth of what it costs in the US is the economics of the madhouse .
Vulnerable
In the event , last week 's standoff was quickly settled .
Fears that the European Union could see supplies affected proved groundless , at least on this occasion .
Europe 's vulnerability is that it receives a quarter of its natural gas from Russia , with Hungary , Austria and the Czech Republic especially vulnerable , as most of it arrives via a pipeline that crosses Ukraine .
When Russia reduced the gas by the amount it normally supplies to Ukraine , there was nothing to prevent the Ukrainians from siphoning off some for themselves , leaving Europe short .
That was never seriously going to happen .
This is the first time Russia has held the presidency of the G8 , a club of which it is not really eligible to be a member .
It is not as pivotal to the global economy as China , India or Brazil , nor is its democratic governance anything to write home about .
The only reason Russia is a member is because it is sitting on the world 's biggest reserves of natural gas , so Putin moved quickly to assuage fears in Europe that supplies might be affected by his local dispute .
While appearing to revel in his image as a strong man , he is not daft enough to alienate the rest of the G8 in such a crass fashion .
That said , Putin has made his point and the G8 will get the message .
At one level , the dispute reflects the fact that the G8 will have a different focus this year .
Tony Blair and Gordon Brown would like to see some follow - through from Britain 's presidency , where the emphasis was on Africa , but Putin is clearly far more interested in energy security .
With oil prices above $ 60 a barrel and reserves of fossil fuels concentrated in parts of the world notable for their political instability , it is reasonable to assume Britain will struggle to keep development high on the agenda .
If Putin forces Blair and Brown to focus on the idiotic nature of government policies on energy and climate change , that would be no bad thing .
Labour 's new year bombshell was the news that it plans to give the go - ahead for a third Heathrow runway , a decision which can only be justified on the basis that growth is more important than climate change .
Having created the conditions for more global warming , the government thinks it can square the circle by building more nuclear power stations to cut down on the use of fossil fuels .
Concerns
Given Britain 's appalling record on energy efficiency , a better idea might be to look at California , where tough state regulations have had a considerable impact on consumption .
Arthur Rosenfeld , energy commissioner for California , told a conference last year that avoiding the 50 % expansion in electricity use over the past 25 years was equivalent to getting 12 million cars off the road .
Unsurprisingly , concerns about the British government 's energy policy are growing , inside and outside parliament .
Labour backbencher Colin Challen has introduced a bill calling for the contraction and convergence method for tackling climate change to be enshrined in law .
There is not much hope that the government will adopt his bill , but it should .
C&C involves reducing greenhouse gases to a sustainable level over the next few decades ( contraction ) and over the same period arriving at a situation where everybody on the planet has an equal right to pollute ( convergence ) .
It is simple , it is radical and it is the best - perhaps the only - idea around that offers a solution to climate change .
Instead , we 're scrabbling around looking for a quick fix - urging Opec to pump more oil , building more nuclear power stations , occupying Iraq - in the hope that there is a magic solution to the problem of ever - rising demand and limited supply .
There is n't .
Russia 's skirmish with Ukraine will be merely the foretaste of bigger and nastier conflicts over energy unless it is recognised that the party is over and the days of cheap oil and gas are gone for good .

THE birth of a new language is such a rare event that scientists who want to watch it happen generally have to make do with computer simulations .
Bruno Galantucci , a cognitive scientist at Yale University in America , has developed a human alternative , based on the principle that necessity is the mother of invention .
He asks pairs of strangers to play a computer game in which they have to find one another in a virtual bungalow .
This requires them to communicate , but the only way they can do so is by inventing a language .
The game is revealing some of the secrets of successful communication .
The two players cannot see or hear each other , but they are seated at interconnected computers .
In the simplest version of the game , each player is located in one of four rooms and must find each other in one move each .
These rooms are arranged in a square , and each pair of adjacent rooms is connected by a doorway .
On the floor of each room is an icon — a circle , a hexagon , a flower — and , prior to the game starting , the players have a short time to explore their surroundings .
( Sometimes , a player with good spatial awareness can move quickly through all four rooms and understand the layout but others do not grasp it at this stage . )
The players know there is another player in another of the rooms , and that they must both end up in the same room , but they can only ever see the room they are in .
To help them guide each other to a rendezvous , they have a device on which they can scrawl symbols that appear on the other 's screen .
But the device works like a roll of paper that constantly scrolls downwards , preventing them from writing letters , numbers or any other commonly recognisable symbol .
The first thing Dr Galantucci discovered was how quickly reliable symbolic systems emerged .
Nine out of ten pairs solved the game in three hours , having agreed on a set of three or four symbols .
In a more advanced version of the game , one pair developed 16 symbols in six hours .
The languages were also very different .
Dr Galantucci had expected that the pairs would build their language on elements of the icons that appear on the floors of the rooms .
A few did so , but they extracted different features of the icons — the number of vertices , say , or some linear abstraction of its shape .
Others adopted a numbering system for the rooms — such as one slanting line for the first room and two for the second , moving clockwise or anticlockwise through the four rooms .
Another technique involved labelling the rooms by their relative position in space , by placing marks on different parts of the screen .
Some pairs solved the game in minutes , others struggled for hours and there were a few pairs who never found each other .
In those cases , Dr Galantucci often saw the ideographic equivalent of a person shouting loudly in a foreign country where he does not speak the local language .
Since his volunteers included Yale University post - doctoral students , he infers that building a language is no trivial task .
But then what are the ingredients of successful communication ?
Having observed winning pairs at play , Dr Galantucci says that communication is established as soon as one player decides to copy the symbols proposed by his co-player , rather than impose his own .
At that point the pair 's chances of finding each other jump .
As soon as there is imitation , he says , there is a common currency .
After that , it is relatively easy to attach useful information to those symbols .
Dr Galantucci is now developing the game to make it increasingly complicated by adding on extra rooms .
He is also working with trios , and hopes eventually to build up to small groups — more closely mimicking the conditions in which human language evolved .
Giacomo Rizzolatti , a neuroscientist at the University of Parma in Italy who studies the origins of language , says the game is interesting because it shows the importance of imitation in language development .
But he points out that the symbolic systems adopted — numerical ones , for instance — are sophisticated abstractions that would have been beyond the minds that produced the first proto-language .
One strength of Dr Galantucci 's experiment that does not exist in the real world , however , is that he is able to interview his subjects afterwards .
What is striking , he says , is that a pair can be successful even if a symbol represents something quite different in the virtual world to each player — as long as they agree on what they should do when confronted by it .
In other words , people only need to convey a small amount of information to communicate effectively , and they can do so while holding fundamentally different ideas about how their language describes the world .
It was n't that long ago that the same cast and crew who are now claiming to be misinformed , uninformed or in denial went to great and extraordinary lengths to interject themselves into my life .
Armed with factually - wrong information , innuendo and a partisan play book , Congress pontificated at length about their " moral authority " and how they " had to act " when it came to " saving " someone who did not want or ask for their help .
And we all remember that when it came to my private situation , these leaders in Congress acted swiftly - with blinding certainty and authority .
But in the Mark Foley affair , when the leaders of this Congress were armed with facts and a history of behavior that may go back for years , they were blind .
When they actually had a moral and legal duty to protect children under their care , their " moral authority " was absent .
Is that just a coincidence ?
It could be that , when it came to me and my family , leaders like Tom Reynolds and Tom Delay and Rick Santorum saw a chance for political gain .
And when they looked at Mark Foley they saw something else - something that could actually cost them votes .
Or perhaps those leaders just weighed out the situation and determined that my rights as an American and my obligation to my family just are n't worth risking one of their seats in Congress .
No matter what the reason , nobody needs to be told how wrong that is .
And to the benefit of the nation I am sure their self - interest and obvious hypocrisy will cost them more than one seat in Congress .
Because to me , it 's as simple as this : if you can act so quickly to " save Terri " why wo n't you act to protect children in your care ?
That 's something I may never understand .
And it has n't escaped my attention either that most of the people on the Foley hot seat are the same ones who voted to put Congress in Terri 's hospice .
People like Tom Reynolds , Sue Kelly , Dennis Hastert , Don Sherwood , Mike Fitzpatrick , Mark Kirk and , yes , even Mark Foley voted to put the Congress in my personal life when they should have been looking at his .
If you want to see how your member of Congress voted , we have the list on the TerriPAC homepage - here .
And if you 're a KOS reader you know I started TerriPAC to keep the issue of privacy and our freedoms in the public debate - even campaigning for and against specific candidates .
If you 've kept up with our progress , I 've personally travelled throughout Florida , in Connecticut and Colorado .
And about two weeks ago , TerriPAC wrote more than $ 10,000 in PAC checks to congressional candidates in North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , New York , Connecticut and elsewhere .
To see who we 're supporting across the country you can visit the TerriPAC Election Center - here .
You can be assured that this Foley debacle wo n't keep me off the campaign trail .
To the contrary , I 'm planning to spend a great deal of time in these final few weeks travelling to help good candidates win and make sure our leaders answer for their behavior - whether it 's unwanted and illegal action directed at me or criminal inaction when it comes to Foley .
We 're already booked for trips to Pennsylvania , Chicago and Miami and we have other stops in the works .
As always , if you know of a campaign that needs our help , send an email to the PAC at Director@TerriPAC.com or call us at 1-800 - TerriPAC .
We 'll be on the road , doing our best to remind voters from sea to sea what 's at stake this November .
Please stop by our PAC site and give us a hand .
The more help we get the more help we can be .
To me , as a former Republican , this election is about Iraq , it is about Mark Foley , it is about Katrina and it is about Terri .
When this Congress gets it wrong , they really get it wrong .
It 's a very good thing we all get a chance to set it right .

Recently I released a command line script which manages your todo list in a plain text file .
One of the best reasons for keeping a todo .
txt are the unlimited ways you can interact with it : anything and everything can read and parse text files .
So as a programming exercise I set out to write an AOL instant messenger bot that updates and views your todo .
txt from anywhere , and after only a few hours , my TodoBot was up and running .
Advertisement
Why would you want to IM your todo list , you ask ?
Say you 're at the store and you forgot what you were supposed to buy .
IM your bot list @shopping from your phone to find out .
Say you keep your todo list on your home computer and you want to access it from the office .
With the TodoBot you do n't have to go through the trouble of running a home server - simply IM todo commands to your bot .
Advertisement
Let 's take a look at the todo .
txt bot in action , and get it set up on your computer .
Note :
To get your TodoBot going , you need to be already running the Todo manager script .
If you do n't know what I 'm talking about , start here for a little intro to the thinking behind todo.
txt .
Then install the latest version .
If you 're on Windows , you 'll need to use Cygwin .
Get yourself some detailed instructions on doing that here .
Once you 've got your todo .
txt going , you 're ready to set up your bot .
The TodoBot in action
Here 's a short screencast of my TodoBot in action :
Advertisement
Notice that you omit the " todo " part of the todo commands and get straight to the actions .
So instead of todo add ' do laundry ' you just tell the bot add ' do laundry ' .
All the bot does is issue todo commands , so the todo bit is assumed .
Neat , huh ?
You too can know the wonderful marriage of IM and .txt .
Set up your TodoBot
Warning : Setting up the todobot.pl requires comfort with editing and running a Perl script .
It 's not too scary ; but it 's not an installation wizard , either .
Advertisement
Here 's how to get your TodoBot set up .
First register for an AIM screenname which you 'll use as your bot at AIM.com .
Mine 's called gtraptodobot , yours can be anything you like .
Get Perl running on the computer where your todo . txt lives .
If you 're running Cygwin , install the Perl package using setup.exe , as described here .
Mac and Linux users , you 're all set with the Perl .
Download the TodoBot Perl files , which come in two varieties .
The bot requires the OSCAR package to run , so for the lazier ( and less experienced ) , download this zip file with OSCAR included .
If you 're all down with the C and the PAN and Perl module installation , download todobot.pl and then grab and install OSCAR .
pm separately .
If necessary , unzip the Todobot bundle .
Then , open up the file called todobot.pl and edit the following lines :
my $ screenname = ' yourbotname ' ; my $ password = ' yourbotpassword ' ; my $ commander = ' yourAIMname ' ; my $ todoscript = 'c:/path/to/your/todo/script/todo';
In the first two lines , enter the bot nickname and password you signed up for in step 1 .
In the third line , enter the AIM name you 'll use to run todo commands .
In the last line , enter the full path to your todo manager script .
Save and close todobot.pl .
To start the TodoBot , at the command line type perl todobot.pl .
All goes well , your bot will log into AIM without a hitch .

Now 's the fun part .
Login to AIM with your regular nick and add your bot to your buddy list .
Then , message todo script commands from your IM window as if you were at a command line .
Try it : IM your bot add get to know my todobot .
And that 's that !
You 're IM 'ing your way to todo .
txt nirvana ; with no server running , no hosted service , no keeping your data on someone else 's server .
Rock on .

Security
Now , I 'm sure I 've got a posse of system administrators ready to bust a blood vessel at the idea of an AIM bot running a shell script .
Yes , this is highly insecure .
Yes , you can stick a semi-colon in your IM and run any command you want .
But .
Advertisement
The trick to the todobot.pl is that it checks from whom the command is issued .
That is , if YOU message MY bot ?
You 'll get a message that says , " You 're not the boss of me . "
Cuz you 're not .
So no one else except your IM name - set in the script - can modify or view your todo .
txt with your bot .
Doing this means you trust that no one can spoof your AOL username , and of course , all your IM 's pass as plain text over the network .
It 's up to you to decide whether or not you want to take these risks .

Caveats
This is literally the first Perl script I 've ever written , and I did it in about 2 hours today .
In fact , I did n't even write it ; I adapted it from this very helpful O'Reilly article , Build Your Own AIM Answerbot .
Without a doubt there are some bugs to be worked out ; so back up your todo .
txt before trying it out .
I 'm sure you Perl programmers especially will have lots to say about it .
I invite your criticism , modifications and outright scorn .
Bring it on in the comments or to tips at lifehacker.com .

Happy AIM'ing your todo. txt !
UPDATE : I ( stupidly ) forgot to thank Joel Johnson for the TodoBot idea and mwilkie for a long late night discussion on Perl module installation and security implications .
Thanks , guys !
You 're the wind beneath the TodoBot 's wings .

Ryan H was pretty excited to start his new job as a developer .
But his excitement quickly faded after he started .
It did n't fade into apprehension , disappointment , or regret -- just into nothing ; he simply stopped feeling anything at all .
This type of apathy is to be expected when one is given the type of assignment that Ryan was given : absolutely nothing .
Ryan 's day to day job was to sit and patiently wait for the company to start up a project .
Ryan 's manager was in the same position ; the business was still trying to decide what it wanted to do and their small team was forbidden from doing any type of development work in the mean time .
So they all did nothing .
Well , not " nothing " nothing -- everyone knows that a lack of work is no excuse for not working -- it was more a delicate balancing act of trying to look busy while not looking so busy as to give the impression that more help is needed .
After all , that 's how they ended up with Ryan .
But Ryan was not content with doing nothing .
He wanted something .
Anything .
It did n't matter what .
Heck , a broom to sweep the floor ; at least then he'd have some sense of accomplishment .
Ryan 's cries were heard and he was finally granted a task : data entry .
His manager was able to justify this by arguing that , since his group would be automating they process eventually , they should learn how it works .
And that they did .
To say that the task was " data entry " would be like saying that riding a roller coaster is " driving a car . "
Bad analogy .
I should say , watching a roller coast simulator .
Err , no , that does n't quite work , either .
Okay , to say that the task was " data entry " would be like saying that sitting in a chair and staring at the wall is " driving a car . "
The " data entry " task that Ryan inherited involved signing on to a Windows Server with Terminal Services , double - clicking an icon on the desktop , entering yesterday 's date , clicking the " run " button , and letting the application process data for seven or so hours .
And there was one other thing : it was absolutely vital that Ryan switched over to the terminal server and moved the cursor once at least once every fifteen minutes .
If that did n't happen , the server would disconnect the session and the " data entry " process would need to run again .
For another seven or so hours .
There was no way around the " every fifteen minute " rule : corporate security would not budge on the " idle " session timeout , let alone allow any " mouse moving " programs .
Ryan quickly learned to have someone cover for him whenever he'd step away for a meeting , lunch , or anything else .
There 's nothing more painfully ironic than having to stay at work for another four hours in order to move a mouse every fifteen minutes .
Ryan also learned his lesson about complaining , so he kept his mouth shut .
Besides , he eventually got some development work to do and just put up with the mind - numbing nuisance involved in moving the mouse every fifteen minutes .
His manager , however , did not have it in him .
When Ryan went on vacation , he came back to find how his manager was able to solve the " data entry " task that he temporarily took over .
Being the creative fellow he is , Ryan 's manager found a spare workstation , brought in the Fisher Price Vibrating Rocking Chair from his attic , and placed an optical mouse in seat ; the process was now able to run unattended because the minute mouse movements would continually reset the timeout counter .
To this day , the FP - VRC remains a vital part of their data entry automation process .
社内の精鋭エンジニアを中心に定期的に勉強会をすることになった。んで、
JavaScript の講義は僕がやることになった。
資料を社内だけでとどめておくのはもったいないので、ここに公開していきます。社内の人も社外の人も読んでください。
講義の内容は基本的にソース嫁。ソースレビュー形式。
※ターゲットは JavaScript は書いたことない、オブジェクト指向言語プログラマ。
Section 00 Prototype.js の前に JavaScript のオブジェクトの概要・・・
オブジェクトを作ってみる。
var object = {} ;
オブジェクトにメソッドとかプロパティを追加してみる。
var object = { field : ' IT戦士 ' , method : function ( ) { alert ( ' hello ' + this . field ) ; } } ; object.method ( ) ;
後で関数を付けたりできる。関数内の this は実行時に決まる 。
var object = { field : ' IT戦士 ' } ; function func ( ) { alert ( ' hello ' + this . field ) ; } object.method = func ; object.method ( ) ;
呼び出すときに直接 this を与えることも出来る 。
function func ( ) { alert ( ' hello ' + this .
field ) ; } var object = { field : ' IT戦士 ' } ; func.apply ( object ) ; // func.call( object ) ;
同じ形式のオブジェクトを大量生産したい場合がある。以下のようにする。
関数の prototype プロパティに大量生産したいオブジェクトを入れる。new を付けて関数を呼び出してオブジェクトのコピーを大量生産する。
function factory ( ) {} factory .
prototype = { field : ' IT戦士 ' , method : function ( ) { alert ( ' hello ' + this .
field ) ; } } ; var object00 = new factory ( ) ; var object01 = new factory ( ) ; var object02 = new factory ( ) ;
new を付けて呼び出すとコピーされたオブジェクトが this となって関数が呼ばれる。すなわち、初期化を行うことが出来る。
function factory ( ) { this .
field = ' IT戦士 ' ; } factory .
prototype = { method : function ( ) { alert ( ' hello ' + this .
field ) ; } } ; var object00 = new factory ( ) ; var object01 = new factory ( ) ; var object02 = new factory ( ) ;
ちなみに下の二つの関数宣言はほとんど同じ意味。(ちょっと違うけど)
function factory ( ) {}
var factory = function ( ) {} ;
これを踏まえて、さっそく Secsion 01 でクラスを作ります。
According to a UN weather report that was leaked earlier this week , the UN weather experts predict a grim future for our planet .
By the year 2050 the temperature will have risen 3 degrees Celsius , it is still too early to say if it is caused by emission of green house gasses , or if it ’s a result of the ever changing climate of the planet .
The rise in the world ’s temperature will to begin with cause floods and draughts .
It will also be the source of warmer oceans which in the end will feed larger and more violent hurricanes , making hurricanes like Katrina a common thing .
After a while , the increased temperature will have caused a significant melting of ice in the Polar Regions .
This will not only be the end of many unique animals in those regions , but it will also cause a drop in the salinity of the oceans around the poles .
A drop in salinity will slow the Gulf Stream down , and in time , this will cause a drop in the ocean temperature that will be the start of a new ice age in northern Europe .
This may be the biggest challenge or threat to face mankind ever .

Babies may be cute , but they are certainly expensive
In the last year alone , the cost of raising offspring has risen by 9 % , said research from financial services provider Liverpool Victoria .
It now estimates that a child costs its parents £ 23.50 per day .
Childcare and education are said to be the most expensive factors , costing parents an average £ 49,092 and £ 46,778 per child respectively .
Education costs are said to have risen 26 % since last year , helping to put up the expense of raising a child by a rate outstripping inflation almost four times .
Money from grandparents
The report concludes that the high cost of starting a family has increased the cultural shift away from households having just one working parent .
Raising a family requires careful financial planning and regular saving , as well as a great deal of hard work
Liverpool Victoria's Nigel Snell
If found that today both parents have to work to cover the cost of bringing up children in two - thirds of families .
A further 12 % of working parents said they need to rely upon grandparents or other family members for regular financial support to help meet the costs of bringing up their children .
" Raising a family requires careful financial planning and regular saving , as well as a great deal of hard work , " said Liverpool Victoria 's communications director Nigel Snell .
NEW YORK --
When daylight - saving time starts earlier than usual in the United States come 2007 , your VCR or DVD could start recording shows an hour late .
Cellphone companies could give you an extra hour of free weekend calls , and people who depend on online calendars may find themselves late for appointments .
An energy bill President Bush is to sign today would start daylight time three weeks earlier and end it a week later as an energy - saving measure .
And that has technologists worried about software and gadgets that now compensate for daylight time based on a schedule unchanged since 1987 .
'' It is unfortunately going to add a little bit of complexity to consumers , " said Reid Sullivan , vice president of Panasonic Consumer Electronics Co. '' In some cases , depending on the product , they may have to manually increase or decrease the time . "
The upcoming transition evokes memories of Y2 K , the Year 2000 rollover that forced programmers to adjust software and other systems that , relying on two digits for the year , never took the 21st century into account .
'' It would n't be a society - wide catastrophe , but there would be a problem if nothing 's done about it or we try to move too quickly , " said Dave Thewlis , executive director of a group that promotes standards for calendar software .
Newer VCRs and DVD recorders have built - in calendars to automatically adjust for daylight time .
Users would have to override them .
Computers with Windows operating systems would need to obtain updates .
Though most affected applications would probably be taken care of by the Microsoft fix , calendar systems will need to be checked .
Technologists sounded louder alarms as the year 2000 approached .
A programming shortcut caused some computers to wrongly interpret 2000 as 1900 , potentially fouling computer systems .
Businesses and governments threw $ 200 billion at the problem .

It 's long been accepted as the most accurate indication of good health , but now the efficiency of the body mass index is being questioned .
Peta Bee reports
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday December 1 2006
We said in the article below that because muscle weighs more than fat , many physically fit people are mistakenly classed as overweight .
A kilogram of muscle weighs exactly the same as a kilogram of fat .
What we should have said is that muscle is denser than fat .
What do Brad Pitt and Russell Crowe have in common with most members of the England rugby and football teams ?
Those perfectly honed , toned bodies , of course .
Except if you rely on the most widely used measurement of fatness , the body mass index ( BMI ) - which classifies this collection of supremely fit- looking individuals as either overweight or obese .
So concerned have some researchers become with such inaccuracies , that they are calling for the BMI to be replaced with more accurate measures of health status .
Devised by the Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet , the BMI has been used to define weight for more than 100 years .
It is used by hospitals and doctors ' surgeries , insurance companies , university researchers , drugs companies and slimming clubs ; and professions such as the fire and police services require prospective employees to have a BMI that does not exceed healthy recommendations .
Part of its appeal is its simplicity of calculation : weight in kilograms is divided by height in metres squared - someone with a BMI of less than 18.5 is considered underweight , between 18.5 and 24.9 is " normal " , 25 to 29.9 is " overweight " and 30 or greater is clinically obese .
But the measurement 's downfall is that it does not take into account body composition - whether or not excess weight is fat or muscle - which is why fit people often find themselves in the fat category of the BMI rating system .
Among those leading the call for the BMI to be replaced is Dr Margaret Ashwell , a visiting research fellow in nutrition at Oxford Brookes University and a former member of the government 's Food Advisory Committee .
" The important thing to consider is how body fat is distributed around the body , as the real problems occur when fat accumulates in the central abdominal region , " Ashwell says .
Now scientists from the renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester are questioning the accuracy and usefulness of the BMI .
Reviewing data from 40 studies involving 250,000 people with heart disease , they found that while severely obese patients had a higher risk of death , overweight people had fewer heart problems than those with a normal BMI .
Because muscle weighs more than fat , many physically fit people are mistakenly classified as " overweight " , while they are actually less likely to die young than a " normal " weight individual whose excess weight is mostly fat .
Dr David McCarthy , a senior lecturer in human nutrition at London Metropolitan University , looked at waist circumference as a predictor of obesity in a study of children published last year in the International Journal of Obesity .
It was found that the average waistband of two - year - old girls has increased by more than 5 % in a decade , while that of boys has grown by 4 % .
The measurements represented a far greater increase in fat than had been suggested by studies using the BMI .
But if BMI is outdated and inaccurate , what else might be used in its place ?
Tim Cole , a professor of medical statistics at the Institute of Child Health at Great Ormond Street Hospital , says that " body mass index is a cheap and cheerful way of measuring fatness but is not terribly good in detail " .
Cole suggests that a waist circumference measurement " is more informative , in that it is a direct measure of the part of the body that tends to accumulate fat " .
Having a waistband of more than 88 cm ( 35 in ) in women and 102 cm ( 40 in ) in men indicates the highest risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease .
There is an increased risk of the diseases for women with measurements of more than 80 cm ( 32in ) and men whose measurement is over 94 cm ( 37in ) .
" Measuring waist circumference can help identify patients at higher risk of these problems , " says Dr David Haslam , a GP and chair of the National Obesity Forum .
" Yet surveys we have carried out show that many people , including some doctors , are unaware that this measurement is a good health predictor . "
Ashwell recommends a waist : height ratio " that is applicable to everyone , even children " .
She has developed her own chart that is already being used by some practice nurses , heart charities and private medical companies such as BUPA .
" Interestingly , when you work out the number of people who are obese using the waist circumference or waist : height ratio , there are more UK men at risk than women .
This underlines the problems with the BMI , which suggests the opposite to be true . "
Getting out a tape measure is a simple way to keep tabs on your fatness at home , but what else is available ?
Dr Beckie Lang , spokesperson for the Obesity Resource and Information Centre ( ORIC ) , says that skin caliper tests , such as those performed at gyms , can give an accurate measurement of body fat " provided the test is done by someone experienced as it is prone to error " .
Otherwise , body - fat scales , such as Tanita , are " fairly accurate " , she says .
" They work by sending a very small current through the body when you stand on the scales , " Lang explains .
" Muscles conduct the current , fat resists it and a computer inside the scales converts these figures to arrive at your body fat percentage . "
Ashwell argues that GPs , insurance companies and the general public need to become used to a different way of thinking .
" What we want is for people to understand that a fat middle is bad news , " she says .
" It is not how much you weigh , but where the excess fat gathers that causes problems . "
Malcolm Gladwell recently gave the keynote at the American Association of Advertising Agencies ’ Account Planning conference in Chicago .
It ’s excerpted on Advertising Age ( $ ) .
If you ’ve worked in design or product development ( or read “ Blink ” ) you know the drawbacks of focus groups .
But what Gladwell does here is describe the solutions as ones of management .
Not surprisingly , I agree .
Here ’s the ending …
Now think about the Aeron chair .
[ The focus group participants ] say they do n’t like the chair , of course they do n’t .
The chair is nothing they ’ve ever seen before , but that was the whole plan in designing the chair .
But that ’s what ’s wonderful about it , that ’s why this chair will make billions of dollars for Herman Miller , but it ’s also what dooms that chair in the focus group , because people do n’t have the language .
Market research , when it is observational or when it is interpretative , is profoundly useful .
But those are two critical things .
They require the intervention of the person conducting the research .
They require the findings that are gathered are considered , and thought about , and processed and interpreted .
Back in the 1950s , most of the major advertising agencies on Madison Avenue employed Freudian psychoanalysts for this precise reason , and you do n’t see that anymore .
I think that ’s a big mistake .
This understanding about what ’s so terrible about focus groups ought to pave the way that we manage people .
First and foremost , it ’s very important for management to trust the creative talent .
The second thing is patience .
The more breakthrough , the more revolutionary and the more innovative an idea is , the longer it will take for people to come to appreciate it .
The third thing is it requires people in management to tolerate uncertainty .
The thing that ’s driving all this focus - group and market - research data is the desire of people with the management power to make every decision as methodical and thought out and certain as possible .
A sure fire way to set off a full scale geek war is to promote one software development methodology over another .
Online behaviour being what it is , methodology wars usually take the form of tearing down an “ opposing ” methodology rather than promoting the preferred methodology in isolation .
This approach serves two purposes ; first , highlighting things you see as wrong is often a good way to clarify your point about what is right .
Second , it ’s a great way to attract attention and inflame passions .
Back in the day , operating system wars were all the rage and arguments over Windows vs. * nix vs. Apple left blood on the wall of many an IT department .
The operating systems wars are far from resolved but methodology wars are a far sexier topic these days .
For a few years now , advocates of Agile methodology have been evangelising it as the cure to all ills ( as a side note , it ’s interesting how this topic lends itself to political and religious terminology – ideology , war , evangelists ) .
One of the things the Agile movement has in its favour is a fairly significant mindshare in the IT set and a commensurate share of shelf space in the IT section of bookshops .
One of Agile ’s biggest problems is its supporters have trouble pointing to any large scale successes .
By definition , Agile works best with small teams .
In the real world , 90 % of IT workers work in big IT departments .
I ’m not about to rush to the defence of huge bureaucracies but changing the structure of a company based on an unproven theory is a tough sell .
Another plus for Agile is its proponents are usually very good at identifying the shortcomings of existing processes and methodologies .
The downside is often , again , that real - world success with Agile methodologies is more difficult to attain than the glowing manifestos tend to suggest .
The tendency of Agile proponents to respond to failures by saying “ You did n’t do it right ” does n’t inspire a lot of confidence in non-devotees .
Surely if it is such a panacea it should n’t be so hard to implement ?
At the end of the day , the right methodology is the one that works .
Slavish adherence to any development dogma is going to get you into trouble ( I could argue the same for actual religious dogma but that would probably get me into even more trouble than questioning Agile – if such a thing were possible . )
The real world does n’t fit into neat boxes and anyone who tries to arbitrarily fit diverse situations into the same box ( because that ’s what you should do , dammit ! ) is headed for a world of pain .
And reflexively blaming failures on the… ummm , box - maker ( taking a metaphor too far is a mistake ) almost always undermines your credibility rather than advancing your cause .
Agile proponents often suggest the only alternatives are the twin evils of “ waterfall ” or “ Big Design Up Front ” ( BDUF ) .
Traditionally , the waterfall method assumes development is completely linear process .
A business case is developed and thrown over the wall to a designer and / or Business Analyst .
A spec is written and thrown over a wall to a software designer .
A software spec is written and thrown over a wall to a programmer .
A solution is developed and thrown over a wall to a tester .
The system is tested then thrown to users .
Anyone who thinks that such a process can deliver anything workable without making all participants ’ lives a misery is far scarier than the most wild - eyed Agile evangelist .
In such a complex process as software and system development arguing that you can define ahead of time when any of the stages will be “ done ” and never need revisiting is tantamount to insanity .
It certainly has no tangible relationship to reality .
In any development cycle , each stage is likely to reveal something new or some additional complexity that was n’t considered in the previous stage .
Sometimes this will mean revisiting a previous stage to clarify the way forward and sometimes it means an extension to the time for the current stage to be completed .
If a methodology is n’t fluid enough to allow for these variations then it is doomed to fail .
Full disclosure time : Disclosure 1 – I ’m a proponent ( broadly ) of what Agile fans derisively call BDUF , so long as the disclaimers are in place that allow it to be an iterative process .
I subscribe to the crazy idea that if you do n’t have a clear idea of what you ’re trying to do before you start programming ( i.e. do at least some Big Design Up Front ) then how the hell do the programmers know if they ’re doing the right thing ?
I ’m also a believer in having faith in each person involved in the process so I like to keep the process fluid .
When one person discovers an issue that has n’t been thought of up to that point , the process has to be fluid enough to cope with this ( e.g. it must be possible to revisit design decisions and re-write specs when necessary ) .
Disclosure 2 : I do n’t have a great depth of knowledge of Agile .
I read quite a bit on the topic , usually from Agile advocates but I do n’t have real - world experience of using the process .
Personally , I can see lots of promise in the Agile approach so long as the participants are open - minded and the workplace has the resources to dedicate to the required training .
Religious evangelism of Agile makes me uncomfortable and sometimes it seems absurdly easy to pick the zealots apart .
I read the Signal vs. Noise blog of the 37 Signals crowd quite often and I think they offer some excellent advice to smaller organisations .
I also think they have a tendency to promote their pro-Agile views as universal truths that will work anywhere .
When pressed ( for instance , in critical comments ) they will add the disclaimer “ yeah , this might not work everywhere ” but it would be a lot less annoying if they added this qualifier up front .
Glibly asserting that your methods are universally applicable when they clearly are n’t provides ammunition for your opponents – do n’t give them a free shot .
At this point , I ’d like to add a disclaimer :
The 37 Signals guys are probably much smarter ( and richer ) than me and definitely develop some very good products .
If I was running a startup I would definitely listen to what they say but for anyone in large organisations , a grain of salt is recommended .
Couching this discussion in religious terms is intended to have more than a humourous effect ( although hopefully it added some humour ) .
Much like I would run a mile from an evangelical politician who zealously pursued his goal to introduce a theocratic state , I try very hard to avoid people who obsessively seek to install a methodology ahead of worrying about achieving practical results .
I ’ve seen enough examples of disasters to believe that it ’s almost impossible to successfully implement an even moderately complex system without some formal methodology in place .
“ Flying by the seat of your pants ” is not a way of life I aspire to .
But when the tools start to take ascendency over the end result , it ’s usually time for a reality check .
Weeks before shooting his second movie , Requiem for a Dream , Darren Aronofsky took the film 's star , Jared Leto , to see The Matrix at a Brooklyn mall .
It was the spring of 1999 , and Aronofsky had already established himself as one of the most promising directors of his generation .
His indie debut , π – a brainy thriller filmed for $ 60,000 – had been a sleeper hit at the Sundance Film Festival the year before , earning him an award for best director .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
" I walked out of The Matrix with Jared and I was thinking , ' What kind of science fiction movie can people make now ? ' "
Aronofsky says .
" The Wachowskis basically took all the great sci- fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured .
Suddenly Philip K. Dick 's ideas no longer seemed that fresh .
Cyberpunk ? Done . "
Challenged and exhilarated , the director started taking walks around Manhattan with an old college buddy , Ari Handel , to toss around ideas for a new film they would eventually call The Fountain .
After spending eight years at New York University mapping the brains of rhesus macaques , Handel had quit neuroscience to become a writer .
Aronofsky and Handel 's freewheeling conversations ranged over primate neurology , the physics of space travel , and the history of Mayan civilization .
One of the director 's first concepts for the script , Handel says , was a dramatic juxtaposition : " I remember Darren saying , ' How cool would it be to cut from a battle scene in some historical period to a man traveling alone in space for an unknown reason ? ' "
For Aronofsky , the seminal science fiction films of previous eras – like 2001 : A Space Odyssey and Star Wars – had dared to reimagine space and time .
" 2001 was the first sci - fi movie to deal with real physics , " he explains .
" Kubrick introduced his audience to a zero-g world with no up and down or left and right .
Then Lucas came along with Star Wars and kicked it all into hyperdrive . "
He felt that in the past three decades , the visual innovations introduced by these directors had degenerated into a set of stale conventions , particularly an overreliance on digital imagery .
After seeing The Matrix , Aronofsky became determined to be the next director to push the genre into new territory .
" No matter how good CGI looks at first , it dates quickly , " he says .
" But 2001 really holds up .
So I set the ridiculous goal of making a film that would reinvent space without using CGI . "
Seven years later , Aronofsky has done just that .
Opening in the US on November 22 , The Fountain has already proven to be his most controversial and divisive film .
Some early reviews have been scathing , and its first press screening at the Venice Film Festival was greeted by a chorus of boos .
The following night , though , festivalgoers gave the movie a 10 - minute standing ovation .
Expectations for Aronofsky 's third feature run particularly high because his first two were so full of promise .
In 1998 , π rebooted film noir with an edgy mix of home - brew computing , day - trading , and kabbalah .
Then Requiem for a Dream – based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s harrowing portrait of addiction – won praise in 2000 for its radical cinematography , taut script , and Oscar - nominated performance by Ellen Burstyn .
Like Pulp Fiction and The Matrix , both movies announced the arrival of a new kind of filmmaker influenced as much by TV , the Internet , break beats , and manga as by the canon of the silver screen .
Aronofsky 's hip hop montages – obsessive loops of iconic images and sounds – were imitated in dozens of music videos .
The young director even got a bitchy smackdown from fellow auteur Gus Van Sant , who accused him of having " MTV eyes . "
But The Fountain is a major departure from Aronofsky 's previous work .
Gone are the twitchy visuals and funky Brooklyn storefronts – " I burned out on my own schtick , " he says .
Here the director 's canvas is stretched from the top of a Mayan pyramid to a modern neuroscience lab to the incandescent core of a nebula in deep space .
And while π and Requiem were intimate art house fare , The Fountain – equal parts sci-fi , swashbuckling adventure , and medical thriller – tries to be three blockbusters in one .
Former X - Man Hugh Jackman and acclaimed British actress Rachel Weisz play time - tripping lovers whose devotion spans a millennium .
In the 1500s , a conquistador named Tomas , played by Jackman , is dispatched to the Yucatan jungle by Queen Isabel ( Weisz ) on a desperate mission to find the tree of eternal life prophesied in Mayan myth .
Cut .
In the present day , Weisz is a writer named Izzi suffering from advanced brain cancer , and Tom is her neuroscientist husband obsessed with finding a cure .
Cut .
Five centuries later , Tom pilots a bubblelike biosphere toward a star that is about to explode .
Tattooed and gaunt , he 's haunted by memories of Izzi 's deathbed request to help her finish writing a book called The Fountain .
" Darren has grown up , " says Weisz , who is also Aronofsky 's fiancée .
" This is a more mature film than π and Requiem .
It asks the most adult question of all : How do we relate to our own mortality ?
But it 's still messing with you on so many levels . "
Like Burstyn's skittering hallucinations in Requiem , The Fountain 's most haunting images linger in the mind long after the credits roll .
When Tomas reaches toward the tree of life , golden filaments bristle and rise to meet his fingers .
At the film 's climax , Tom and his bubble are blown through galactic clouds and pillars of dark matter that look like nothing else in science fiction .
By bucking the conventions of CGI and using an ingenious application of microphotography to simulate space , Aronofsky has given the scenes in the nebula a handwrought quality that evokes the luminous etchings of William Blake .
Perhaps the most surprising thing about the movie , though , is that the director was able to finish it at all .
Just before the scheduled start of shooting in 2002 , the film 's original star , Brad Pitt , abruptly bailed .
Costar Cate Blanchett left shortly thereafter .
At various points in the production , Aronofsky 's backers pulled out , studio executives questioned his sanity , and the script went through a radical reincarnation .
The Fountain – an allegory about the promise of eternal life – died several ugly deaths on its way to the screen .
The inside story of the film is a classic tale of a prodigy tempted to excess by Hollywood megabudgets and the commercial potential of boldface names .
But in the end , Aronofsky 's determination to reinvent sci- fi without CGI helped save The Fountain and his own indie soul .
" EVERYONE IN HOLLYWOOD SAID NO TO THE FOUNTAIN at least once , including the people who eventually made it , " Aronofsky told me in May in his cluttered office in Hell 's Kitchen .
Weisz was three weeks away from having their first child , a boy .
Lanky and rabbinically handsome , the 37 - year - old Aronofsky has the unaffected charisma of the hip basketball coach at a Jewish summer camp .
He grew up in a close - knit Brooklyn neighborhood just down the boardwalk from Coney Island 's Cyclone roller coaster and clanging arcades .
The endorphin rushes of the midway are still hard - coded in his memory .
" To me , watching a movie is like going to an amusement park , " he says .
" My worst fear is making a film that people do n't think is a good ride . "
Aronofsky 's first love was not movies but TV .
The son of two public school teachers , he would set his alarm at night so he could sneak downstairs and watch The Twilight Zone .
Before he was old enough to ride the D train to Greenwich Village , his cinematic exposure was limited to second - run blockbusters at a dilapidated popcorn palace called the 77 Cent Theater .
He jokingly attributes The Fountain 's convoluted timeline to his family 's habit of walking in on the middle of the first feature , staying through the second , then sticking around to catch the beginning of the first .
When he got his first computer , a TRS - 80 , in grade school , Aronofsky spent weeks making ASCII animations .
He traces his career to the moment in 1986 when he saw a lobby card advertising Spike Lee 's debut , She 's Gotta Have It .
Shot in Brooklyn in 15 days for $ 175,000 , it grossed more than $ 7 million .
Lee dubbed his DIY approach " guerrilla filmmaking " – a term Aronofsky eagerly adopted .
" I had no idea that this kind of thing was going on until I saw that movie , " he says .
" It opened my eyes . "
A year later he enrolled at Harvard University , where he met many of his future collaborators , including Handel .
The cohosts of Aronofsky 's college radio show , Jeremy Dawson and Dan Schrecker , became his visual f/x supervisors .
While earning his MFA at the American Film Institute in the mid-'90s , Aronofsky hooked up with the future producer of his films , a fellow Spike Lee fan named Eric Watson .
He also met his gifted director of photography there , Matthew Libatique .
Their first team effort , a short called Protozoa , starred the 24 - year - old Lucy Liu .
After seeing Shinya Tsukamoto's hyperkinetic Tokyo Fist at Sundance in 1996 , Aronofsky declared in his journal , " I want to bring cyberpunk to America . "
A year later , the director and his Brooklyn posse launched Protozoa Pictures to make π .
Financed with $ 100 loans from friends , catered by Aronofsky 's mother , and promoted with a graffiti campaign , π was guerrilla filmmaking with mystical ambitions .
Max Cohen , a migraine - afflicted mathematician , builds a computer to scan for hidden patterns in the stock market and ends up shadowed by a Hasidic conspiracy .
Extracting maximum visual impact from a minuscule budget , Aronofsky and Libatique modified cameras with heat lamps and drills , shooting the film on high - contrast reversal stock that turned every surface into a jagged edge – a perfect visual metaphor for Max 's migraines and pervasive paranoia .
" This film was constructed entirely out of its limitations , " Aronofsky bragged at the time .
He vowed to pay everyone back by slaving at Kinko's if π flopped .
Instead , its breakout at Sundance was every director 's dream .
When Artisan Entertainment picked up the film for distribution , a Variety headline blared , " π = $ 1,000,000 . "
AS ARONOFSKY STOOD ON THE THRESHOLD OF SUCCESS , his mother and father were both diagnosed with cancer just weeks apart .
" I was turning 30 and dealing with mortality for the first time in my life , " he recalls .
The themes of The Fountain began to emerge .
Handel immersed himself in books on astronomy , concepts of the afterlife , and the etiology of brain cancer ; his former research career at NYU inspired Tom 's quest for Izzi 's immortality .
Conquistadors came into the mix when Aronofsky read The Conquest of New Spain , Bernal Díaz del Castillo 's bloody 16th - century account of his days in Cortés ' army .
On New Year 's Eve , 1999 , Aronofsky and his friends built a sweat lodge in a Mexican fishing village called Puerto Morelos to celebrate the end of the millennium .
" The Mayan story in the film really came alive on that trip , " the director says .
At 2 am , a crimson moon rose out of the ocean " like a devil 's horns soaked in blood .
It was a heavy omen . "
At that point though , everything seemed to be going his way .
Riding the Requiem buzz , Aronofsky was tapped by Warner Bros. to reinvent the Batman franchise , and he quickly started pushing to get the studio interested in The Fountain as well .
Producer Eric Watson recalls , " We came in and said , ' Batman is great , but we have this other script … '" Batman eventually fell through .
Aronofsky 's gritty take on the caped crusader – battling switchblade - toting pimps in what the script describes as " an almost ORGASMIC release of RAW PENT UP violence " – would have earned an R rating , and Warner Bros. balked .
By then , however , The Fountain was already under way .
Aronofsky and his crew flew to Central America to consult with legendary Mayan experts like Moises Morales Marquez , who has guided scholars through the ruins of Palenque for half a century .
They made a pilgrimage to the Guatemala location used by George Lucas for the rebel - base scene in the original Star Wars film , high in the crumbling temples of Tikal .
" To convince Warner Bros . to give us the big budget to make this very experimental film , we knew we needed real stars , " Handel says .
The director sent an early copy of the script to Brad Pitt , who was already an Aronofsky fan .
Fifty pages into the script , the actor phoned Aronofsky in tears ; the director told him to finish and call back .
In June 2001 , the press announced that Warner Bros. had " fast - tracked " Aronofsky 's new film , with Pitt and Cate Blanchett as the A - list leads .
The budget for Requiem had been a paltry $ 5 million .
Backed by Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures – the company that financed The Matrix – The Fountain was budgeted at $ 70 million .
Elaborate sets , including a pyramid 10 stories high , were mounted on the Gold Coast of Australia .
A huge crew was assembled there , and the former indie filmmaker suddenly found himself choreographing epic battle scenes and massive f/x sequences .
As the director schemed to fly in hundreds of Guatemalan warriors to fight Pitt , the film 's bottom line was stretched to the breaking point .
The superstar actor began demanding extensive script revisions during conferences at his house in the Hollywood hills .
The studio was asking for its own rewrites as well .
In mid-2002 , after endless script wrangling , Village Roadshow announced that it was withdrawing its support .
Everyone on the project was immediately laid off .
Weeks passed .
Eventually another production house , New Regency , stepped in , and set construction recommenced down under .
" We had cleared every hurdle you can imagine , " Watson says .
" There was a sense that now , finally , we were going to make this movie .
The momentum was there . "
Then , just seven weeks before the first day of shooting , Pitt called Aronofsky and told him he was pulling out .
" After working together for two and a half years , Brad lost trust in me and faith in the project , " Aronofsky admits .
" He told me he felt like he was breaking up with a girl . "
Pitt went off to film
Troy , a sword - and - sandal potboiler that earned tepid reviews .
Blanchett took a paycheck for her time and moved on to other projects .
As The Fountain ground to another full stop , the sets and props were auctioned off , and a wave of Brad - bashing was unleashed on the entertainment Web site Ain't It Cool News : " We estimate there are over 1,500 people here in Australia , including family and children , who are now displaced and unemployed , " wrote an alleged member of the Fountain crew .
" PS – New Aussie phrase – when someone shafts you : ' You 've been Pitted . ' "
AFTER A MONTH OF SELF - IMPOSED EXILE IN INDIA and China , Aronofsky returned home to New York , where he spent months holed up in his apartment in a haze of Xbox snowboarding games .
But he could n't get the aborted project out of his mind .
He had come so close to shooting The Fountain that he felt it existed in some parallel universe .
He hired artist Kent Williams to create a graphic novel based on the screenplay , published last year by DC Comics – the only version of the story Aronofsky thought the world might ever see .
Finally , one sleepless summer night in 2003 , Aronofsky stared at the rows of books he and Handel had read to research the film .
" I could feel that The Fountain was not out of my blood , " he recalls .
" And then I remembered : I do n't have to write for the studio or Brad Pitt or any other movie star .
I decided to start acting like an independent filmmaker again . "
After two weeks of manic revision , the director handed a new , slimmed - down version of the script to Watson , who pronounced it filmable for half the cost of Fountain 1.0 .
Aronofsky 's strategy for resurrecting the film was to " take it back to the family , " as he puts it .
Warner Bros. had leaned on him to hire an in - house visual f/x supervisor , but now his college pals Dawson and Schrecker would run the show , as they had for π and Requiem .
A new Izzi was also close at hand : Weisz , the dusky - haired beauty the director had met on a press junket in 2001 .
" If that many people had tried to shut me down , I would have believed them and given up , " Weisz says .
" But Darren has a kind of tenacity that I 've never come across before – tenacity or madness .
So The Fountain did n't have Brad Pitt anymore , for however many gazillions he cost .
Writing a cheaper version of the movie let Darren take a more indie route to getting it made . "
Aronofsky spotted Jackman in a Broadway musical called The Boy From Oz. Backstage , he asked the versatile Australian actor what his next project would be .
" Hopefully , an Aronofsky picture , " Jackman shot back .
He took the role of Tom the following day .
Weisz and Jackman agreed to work at a discount , and Aronofsky got an even better bargain than he thought , for both have recently become major stars .
Weisz won an Oscar in March for her performance in The Constant Gardener , and 2006 has been Jackman 's breakthrough year , with lead roles in X - Men : The Last Stand , Woody Allen 's Scoop , and Christopher Nolan 's The Prestige .
Warner Bros. , which had already sunk nearly $ 20 million into the project , agreed to a new deal – with a bond company looking over Aronofsky 's shoulder .
To cut costs , he shot scenes conceived for jungle locations on a Montreal soundstage .
" On the set , I got to meet a different person from the Darren I know at home , " Weisz recalls .
" He got us to do some really crazy shit .
Darren just keeps the cameras rolling , take after take , which pushed me and Hugh to places of extreme vulnerability and nakedness .
It was sexy to see someone be so good at what they do . "
The studio bean counters , however , remained skeptical that the director could deliver a supernova without supersizing the bottom line .
It was n't the first time that Aronofsky had been challenged to turn practical limitations into subversive opportunities .
" The whole approach of my team is to take old - school techniques and street technology and figure out how to do something fresh and original with them , " he says .
To reinvent space organically , Dawson and Schrecker hunted down old cloud - tank technicians and even hired artists to paint the nebula scenes by hand .
But nothing looked good enough .
Then Aronofsky 's team discovered the work of Peter Parks , a marine biologist and photographer who lives in a 400 - year - old cowshed west of London .
Parks and his son run a home f/x shop based on a device they call the microzoom optical bench .
Bristling with digital and film cameras , lenses , and Victorian prisms , their contraption can magnify a microliter of water up to 500,000 times or fill an Imax screen with the period at the end of this sentence .
Into water they sprinkle yeast , dyes , solvents , and baby oil , along with other ingredients they decline to divulge .
The secret of Parks ' technique is an odd law of fluid dynamics :
The less fluid you have , the more it behaves like a solid .
The upshot is that Parks can make a dash of curry powder cascading toward the lens look like an onslaught of flaming meteorites .
" When these images are projected on a big screen , you feel like you 're looking at infinity , " he says .
" That 's because the same forces at work in the water – gravitational effects , settlement , refractive indices – are happening in outer space . "
The microzoom optical bench furnished Aronofsky 's film with something neither a computer nor an old - fashioned matte painter could deliver – chaos , in all its ultra high - definition fractal glory .
" The CGI guys have ultimate control over everything they do , " Parks says .
" They can repeat shots over and over and get everything to end up exactly where they want it .
But they 're forever seeking the ability to randomize , so that they 're not limited by their imaginations .
I 'm incapable of faithfully repeating anything , but I can go on producing chaos until the cows come home . "
It was , in fact , a reel of Parks ' simulated solar flares that finally convinced the creative department at Warner Bros. to forgo the usual terabytes of digital data .
" The studio gave Darren a really hard time , " Parks recalls .
" Nobody believed he could make this film without CGI .
The studio thought he was crazy .
He had to fly that reel across the Atlantic five or six times . "
But synthesizing a nebula in a drop of fluid to Aronofsky 's liking turned out to be the hairiest job that Parks and his son had ever taken on .
With a stack of Hubble photographs for inspiration , they worked from before dawn till late at night for 10 weeks .
The cost of a single f/x sequence from ILM can reach several million dollars , but Parks shot all the footage Aronofsky needed for just $ 140,000 .
Digitally composited by a Toronto - based f/x house called Intelligent Creatures , Parks ' imagery gave The Fountain 's space scenes a cinematic richness that could n't have been simulated by an army of Pixar animators .
The tagline of π was " faith in chaos , " and even when The Fountain was spinning out of control , Aronofsky says , " I just trusted that things had n't clicked yet for reasons I would understand later .
In the end , I got to make the movie I wanted to make . "
AT THE FILM'S EXPLOSIVE CLIMAX , The Fountain 's three time streams rush together in a visual extravaganza that is so over the top , it 's reminiscent of 2001 's controversial " stargate " sequence – and may leave as many moviegoers scratching their heads .
But the scenes that give the film its gravity are those the young director of π and Requiem would n't have imagined : Izzi , radiant with acceptance at the threshold of death ; Tomas walking angrily away from an open grave in the snow ; a lone space traveler making ink from the ailing tree of life to etch into his skin .
The Fountain may be too downtempo for fans who rallied to Aronofsky 's B - boy bravado .
But the director will earn a new audience for making one of the most visually original and emotionally complex science fiction films in history .
After The Fountain wrapped , Aronofsky jetted back to India to trace the Ganges to its source in the Himalayas .
His parents are healthy again after successful cancer treatment , and in May , Henry Chance Aronofsky was born .
New projects are already piling up on the director 's desk .
Aronofsky and Watson are planning an adaptation of Flicker , Theodore Roszak 's novel about a critic who sees subliminal portents of the apocalypse in B movies .
Aronofsky will also produce an original animated musical by Dawson and Schrecker this fall and is rumored to be developing a script based on the life of Timothy Leary .
None of these projects suggest that the former guerrilla filmmaker who vowed to bring cyberpunk to America is going mainstream .
In recent weeks , he and Handel have started taking long walks around New York City again , brainstorming their next collaboration .
" It 's another fantasy film .
Unfortunately , it 's an even bigger idea than The Fountain , " Aronofsky says .
" So it 's going to take some time to do .
But hopefully not six years . "
One of the biggest disappointments of my so - called adult life is the sad realisation that I can neither fly nor move objects with the power of my mind .
This sucks .
But for all their broken promises , as the prison ships become more and more crowded , when I am prime minister of the One World Government , the psychics will be left well alone .
They 're just too much fun .
Up in Scotland , the Evening Mail has been teasing " Angela 's Live Psychic Line " : the adverts say their psychics are the " real thing " and " truly gifted " at only 75 p a minute .
Apparently Angela was recruiting , so one cheeky scamp at the Evening Mail thought she 'd apply for a job : this is the great British sport of " moron baiting " , and it 's a game we can all play .
After a gruelling 10 - minute phone interview the reporter had a new job .
Psychic Angela asked her for a test reading ; the reporter told her she was " at a crossroads but on the brink of success " , and was hired immediately , despite being neither " truly gifted " nor , more importantly , " the real thing " .
" Her crystal ball must have been on the blink when she signed up our reporter to dupe gullible punters , " said the Evening Mail .
But of course , there is a natural human drive to seek out the transcendent .
A " neurotheology " researcher called Dr Michael Persinger has developed something called the " God Helmet " lined with magnets to help you in your quest : it sounds like typical bad science fodder , but it 's much more interesting than that .
Persinger is a proper scientist .
The temporal lobes have long been implicated in religious experiences : epileptic seizures in that part of the brain , for example , can produce mystical experiences and visions .
Persinger 's helmet stimulates these temporal lobes with weak electromagnetic fields through the skull , and in various published papers this stimulation has been shown to induce a " sensed presence " , under blinded conditions .
There is controversy around these findings : some people have tried to replicate them , although not using exactly the same methods , and got different results .
But however improbable or theologically offensive you might find his evidence , because it is published and written up in full , you can try to replicate it for yourself and find out whether it works .
In fact , you really can try this at home : the kit needed to make a God Helmet is fabulously rudimentary .
You can order a commercial product online for just $ 220 ( £ 119 ) : it is basically eight magnetic coils that fit over the relevant parts of your skull ; the signal is generated by your computer 's soundcard , and then played through these magnetic elements , instead of through the magnetic coils of your speakers .
More excitingly , you can go to the open source development forum Sourceforge and check out " Open - rTMS " , where designs for the necessary hardware and software are being developed collaboratively and openly , and by the same people who brought you " OpenEEG " , a surprisingly effective EEG system that you can also make at home .
In many respects , Sourceforge is exactly what the enlightenment should always have been about : fearless gentlemen self - experimenters , collaborating openly and freely , in search of kicks .
It 's only a fleeting peculiarity of local cultural factors that has resulted in science being so drearily identified with " industry " .
They stole our revolution .
We 're stealing it back .
I want my God helmet and I want it now .

All Things Pythonic
Python Status Update
by Guido van van Rossum
January 10 , 2006
Summary
A rambling discourse touching on my new job , the prospects for PyCon , and what 's hot in python - dev .
Advertisement
Google
So , the new job at Google is a blast !
It 's like being back in college .
There are tons of smart people here , and that does n't just refer to programmers ; it appears that everyone they hire is above average in their domain .
There 's always more to learn ; I expect to be overwhelmed for the first three months and it may take me a year before I feel truly comfortable .
( And did I mention the free food ? :-)
Python is big at Google .
Since I do n't want to bother with getting this blog reviewed by Google , I can't go into much detail , but it's at a secure 3rd place after C++ and Java , and it 's being used for everything from build tools to managing ads .
Name your third - party Python module and someone at Google is probably using it .
So this is an exciting environment -- I get to see first - hand what truly large - scale Python development is like , and where the pain points are .
And did I mention that I get to spend 50 % of my time on Python ?
No strings attached .
Of course I get to spend the other 50 % on Python too , but that 's in a corporate setting .
Fortunately it 's easy to separate the two .
If it uses two - space indents , it 's corporate code ; if it uses four - space indents , it 's open source .
( If it uses tabs , I did n't write it ! :-)
PyCon
The next US Python Conference is soon !
We 've got a new location , Addison TX ( near Dallas ) .
I 've heard some rumblings from the organizers that attendance is lower than expected , but I 'd like to point out that we 've had worries about attendance at every PyCon , and in the end the results were always above all predictions .
And , like most years , we 're keeping early - bird registration open an extra two weeks ( until January 15 ) ; the special rate at the hotel is valid until February 1st .
The program looks spectacular .
We 've got the Plone team keynoting , and on day three instead of a keynote we have an interview with BitTorrent creator and nouveau - enterpreneur Bram Cohen ( submit your questions now ! ) .
Oh , and I believe some BDFL guy is doing a state - of - the - Python talk .
BTW , at least 7 Googlers are coming ( with at least three of us presenting this or that ) .
After the conference there will be four days of sprints .
Like every year , this is an outstanding opportunity for teams that normally communicate via email and IRC to have a few days of coding in the same space -- despite the wonderful invention of the internet , there 's still nothing that quite beats face - to - face contact .
Several groups will be sprinting on core Python things ( possibly even Python 3000 ! ) ; I expect we 'll also see sprints for projects like Twisted , Zope and Plone .
You can sign up your own project via the wiki !
python - dev Despite my 50 % Python time at Google I have n't managed to keep up - to - date with everything that 's going on in python - dev .
( And that 's an understatement ! )
It seems clear however that development is picking up .
Lots of bugs are being fixed ( I 'd especially like to mention my fellow Googler Neal Norwitz here , who seems to have no life :-) .
We 've successfully switched to self - hosted subversion .
( I 'm still waiting for the switch to self - hosted Roundup as the issue tracker , but apparently nobody 's volunteering . )
After I made a few disparaging remarks the AST - branch group got its act together with the result that this new , abstract - syntax - tree - based approach to producing Python bytecode is now mainline for Python 2.5 .
The new infrastructure immediately proved itself by enabling a relative newbie to implement PEP 341 ( merging try / except and try / finally ) .
Martin von Loewis is working on getting rid of a nasty 32 - bit dependency in Python 's implementation : using C ints for indexing Python sequences .
On many 64 - bit platforms , an int holds only 32 bits which makes it a bit of a problem to make effective use of the architecture 's ability to handle strings longer than 2 GB .
This is not a theoretical problem any more ; servers with 6 - 8 GB of RAM are now commonplace .
Another cool new development tool is the Python buildbot .
This is a set of cron jobs that continuously check out the latest version of Python , build it , and run the unit test suite , on a variety of machines .
The results can be viewed live at http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/.
Of course , there 's plenty of heat as well -- a discussion about making ' self ' implicit in Python 3000 that wo n't go away , flame wars about the missing ' quit ' command and about replacing LaTeX ( really ! ) , and the old standby , the GIL .
But all in all it's an enjoyable place , and I plan to spend more time there as soon as I 've handled my backlog of other Python tasks ( like writing the definitive article about Python 's history for the ACM HOPL - III conference , to be held in 2007 ) !
Once that 's done , expect to hear more about Python 3000 on python - dev ( unless the population there bans that subject to a separate list ; I 'm not sure yet whether that would be a good or a bad thing ) .
Talk Back !

Of course , these newfangled ways of watching video are still a small piece of the overall video market , and industry executives and analysts say they expect most consumers to continue buying prerecorded DVD 's for years to come .
They also say they believe that high - definition programs -- and the televisions to watch them on -- are the way of the future .
The question is how consumers will get that programming .
Even without these alternatives , high - definition DVD 's face an unpredictable start .
The inability of the Blu-ray group and HD - DVD camp to agree on a standard means that consumers must consider two sets of machines .
Except for avid technophiles , consumers are likely to wait out the standards battle , lest they get stuck with an obsolete player .
Machines will also be expensive -- $ 1,000 or more -- and consumers will need a television capable of playing high - definition programs , which can easily cost several thousand dollars more .
The list of movies available in the formats will be skimpy at first .
Sony , which leads the Blu-ray group , has said that its new video game consoles , due out this spring , will play Blu-ray DVD's .
But few industry analysts expect consumers to buy the game machine just to watch movies .
In the meantime , other companies are making it easier to watch and copy high - definition movies .
Scientific - Atlanta has a new set - top box with a digital video recorder and DVD recorder built in , so cable subscribers can use a single machine to record programming and burn it onto blank discs .
" Consumers are getting hooked on video - on - demand and the flexibility of moving content around the home , " said Ted Schadler , an industry analyst at Forrester .
" The battle over the format is silly .
For the product to grow , they have to promote the benefits of HD , not battle each other . "
Yet the two sides are digging in their heels , not shaking hands .
Sony , Panasonic , Samsung and other backers of the Blu-ray format expect to flood stores next year with high - definition DVD players , and half a dozen studios will make movies for them .
Gestern fand unter der Überschrift „ The Internet in China : A Tool for Freedom or Suppression ? “ eine Anhörung des Ausschusses für Afrika , Menschenrechte und internationale Angelegenheiten des amerikanischen Parlaments statt .
Geladen waren Vertreter von Yahoo , Google , Mircosoft und Cisco , denen aus Geschäftsinteressen die Unterstützung der chinesischen Regierung vorgeworfen wird .
news.com fasst in seiner Berichterstattung kurz zusammen , was zuvor passierte :
Over the last few months , public scrutiny of China ’s state - mandated censorship has grown thanks to developments such as Microsoft deleting a journalist ’s blog , Yahoo turning over information about a Chinese journalist , and Google offering a censored Chinese search service .
Der Tenor des mit einigen Videoschnipsel von der Anhörung geschmückten Artikel lautet , dass die Abgeordneten den Unternehmen eine Zusammenarbeit mit dem „ Regime der Repression “ vorwerfen .
Microsoft Cheflobbyist Jack Krumholtz sah sein Unternehmen im Recht , Dienste einzustellen , wenn sie „ komplett die Werten der Konsumenten in der Region gefährden . “
Allerdings glaubt Microsoft , so Krumholtz , „ dass wir auf Basis der Menschenrechte und des Rechtes auf freier Meinungsäußerung weiterhin unsere Dienste in China anbieten sollten . “
Na schönen Dank .
Etwas aufgeschlossener zeigte sich Yahoo am Montag zuvor in einer Stellungnahme , in der sie die Regierungen der USA und anderer Länder in die Verantwortung zogen : „ Die Privatwirtschaft allein kann ausländische Regierungen in der Frage der freien Meinungs - und Informationsfreiheit nicht effektiv beeinflussen . “
Dies weiss Die Welt zu berichten .
Die Electronic Frontier Foundation forderte am Morgen der Anhörung den Ausschuss in einem offenen Brief dazu auf , gemeinsam mit der Industrie einfache Richtlinien zum Umgang mit solchen Regimen zu erarbeiteten , nach denen der durch Kooperation mit solchen Ländern mögliche Schaden limitiert werden kann .
Regierung und Industrie haben die Möglichkeit und die Pflicht , Menschenrechte zu schützen .
Eine rare Stellungnahme seitens der chinesischen Regierung wurde vom Regierungsmitarbeiter Liu Zhengrong abgegeben .
Auf den Seiten der Computerwoche ist nachzulesen , dass er die Auffassung vertritt , dass sich die Maßnahmen der chinesischen Regierung nicht sonderlich von denen westlicher Länder unterscheide : „ Die hauptsächlichen Ziele und Methoden zur Umsetzung unsere Gesetze sind im Prinzip die gleichen . “
Diese Argumentation wusste auch Bill Gates auf den Punkt zu bringen : „ Deutschland verbietet Nazi-Propaganda , die in den USA durch die Verfassung geschützt wird .
Sollte ich nun noch Geschäfte in Deutschland machen ? “ ( de.internet.com )
Natürlich rechtfertigt das alleine nicht die defacto- Auslieferung von kritischen Bloggern , wie es Yahoo tat .
Einen weiteren Verstoss gegen Godwins Law hätte eigentlich den Vorsitzenden des Ausschusses , den Republikaner Christopher Smith , disqualifizieren müssen :
Er verglich die Kooperation mit Chinas Kommunistischer Partei mit der Hilfe Hitlers und der NSDAP während des zweiten Weltkrieges .
Zusammengefasst , rügen die US Politiker die Unternehmen für ihre Zusammenarbeit mit China , die Unternehmen wünschen sich von der Politik mehr Rechtssicherheit bei internationalen Angelegenheiten und spielen damit den Ball zurück .
Das US - Außenministerium hat nun die Gründung einer Taskforce für Internet - Freiheit angekündigt , wie heise berichtet : „ Diese Task Force soll sich mit dem Einsatz von Technologie zur Einschränkung der Meinungsfreiheit befassen und Maßnahmen dagegen kordinieren . “
Prekär für Yahoo war die Frage des Abgeordneten Brad Sherman ( Demokraten ) , nach einer eventuellen Zusammenarbeit mit der NSA , welche die Geschichte mit der Unterstützung der Überwachung der US - Bürger wieder aufrollt :
Dem eigentlich nur fürs Ausland zuständige Geheimdienst soll von Yahoo widerrechtlich Informationen über US - Bürger erhalten haben .
Darüber , ob dies auch ohne notwendige richterliche Anordnung geschah , schwieg sich Yahoo - Mitarbeiter Michael Callahan aus .
Das an dieser Stelle zunehmend sichtbarer werdende Maß an Überwachung innerhalb der westlichen
Welt stellt in Frage , in wie weit eine „ Taskforce für Internetfreiheit “ sinnvoll ist , wenn sich künftig die Menschen weniger trauen , ihre Meinung in der „ entwickelten “
Welt zu sagen , ohne dabei überwacht zu werden .
Some Explanation Required , Cocoa and Carbon
' Carbon ' is humongous ; it ’s an umbrella label for a huge number of APIs .
Some of these APIs do exist for compatibility with the old Mac OS ; but some of them are brand new and only exist on Mac OS X .
For one thing , [ Wil Shipley ] starts by calling Carbon a ' compatibility library ' for ' older applications ' , and Cocoa a ' new application environment ' , even though both date from the 1980s .
Yes , the original Mac OS Toolbox APIs are a bit older than the original NextStep object system , but only by a few years .
Some Explanation Required , Cocoa and Carbon
Posted Oct 7 , 2006 — 29 comments below Posted Oct 7 , 2006 — 29 comments below
In " Some Assembly Required " ( a lot of layers to that title ) John Gruber responds to Wil Shipley 's article about the fact that Apple is still publishing procedural frameworks .
The short version is that Shipley does n't like this and Gruber says it 's not all as bad as Shipley makes it sound .
Now this would be thechance for me to lob one back at Daring Fireball for that incident back at the beginning of the year , but I wo n't .
Even though Googlehas me as the top result for " not a professional web developer " .
But no .
High road .
High road .
Before diving in , it 's critical to understand is that a Cocoa programmer 's beef with Carbon is its .
Carbon code is written using lower - level procedural C , often involving calling functions with long lists of unnamed parameters .
It 's not all bad because you use opaque " objects " like CFStrings instead of char buffers , but it 's still the C .
You lose some basic Cocoa concepts like runtime evaluation and key - value coding .
None of this is in dispute , by the way .
The problem is that defense of Carbon often comes in the form of citing the Carbon offers , not its design .
So the two sides end up having two unrelated arguments .
I ask for a four - door vehicle to drive around town and you deliver me a army humvee which runs on diesel .
Yes , technically that does have four doors , but it 's not the sort of package I had in mind .
Daring Fireball says :
On paper , this is true .
The real world picture is a little fuzzier .
Most Mac users that know the term Carbon think of it as aof application .
iTunes is Carbon , iWeb is Cocoa .
That sort of thing .
You can mix and match , but an app is ultimately based in one key framework .
Developers are split .
Some think of Carbon as the high - level application classes like HIView , others think of it as all of that , plus any of the lower - level procedural frameworks , often prefixed with " Core , " such as Core Foundation .
But wait , there 's more .
Not everything called " Core " is included in the Carbon umbrella framework , and the prefix core " Core " does n't even necessarily mean procedural .is an Objective - C ( Cocoa - centric ) framework , even though it sits right beside CoreVideo which is a procedural , CF - style framework .
CoreData has the " Core " prefix but is exposed as Objective - C , and is even included in Cocoa .h .
Lost yet ?
Yup , so are we .
Wil Shipley 's point is thatshould ultimately be exposed as Objective - C. QuickTime is already heading in this direction with QTKit .
So maybe his concern is n't so much " Carbon " as it is Apple publishing procedural frameworks .
So now that we know Carbon is a nebulous term , is it old or new technology ?
Daring Fireball says this :
The date does n't matter .
Regardless of what Apple says for PR reasons , Carbondesigned to provide Mac Toolbox compatibility on Mac OS X .
There 's no other reason to put so much effort into a secondary application frameworkthey intended to replace Cocoa , and that 's clearly that 's not the case .
Carbon came about because Microsoft , Adobe and the like were n't going to budge . , Carbon stretched itself between Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X .
This shows up in both API and the behavior .
On the behavior side , look at event processing .
An idle Cocoa app is generally just that : idle .
An idle Carbon app often will just sit there and constantly poll for events .
You can see this right now with iTunes .
It 's less of an issue as machines get faster and faster , but it 's still there .
Wil Shipley describes the syntax side really well .
In short , Carbon generally makes you write a lot more code that 's a lot harder to read .
Back to Daring Fireball :
The years are pretty close but the thinking is miles apart .
NeXT jumped on the object - oriented bandwagon .
It took PowerPlant for that to happen on the Mac side .
So maybe the way to say it is that Carbon uses much more dated , if not as dated in terms of when the code was written .
O agentie interactivă de publicitate functioneaza in definitiv ca o companie digital ă si este similară cu o agentie convențional ă de publicitate și marketing .
Odată cu creșterea în diversitate a produselor existente pe piata si a marketarii lor in on - line , la care se adauga îmbunătățirea rețelelor sociale , nevoia de a oferi cumpărătorilor un produs personalizat , adaptat la necesitățile actuale , a devenit motorul business - urilor de pretutindeni .
Exact acesta este obiectul muncii unei agentii interactive .
Ea are in componenta sa o organizație interactivă , care oferă servicii creative , orientate mai ales către mediul on - line .
Acest lucru este realizat prin intemediul agentiilor de publicitate , agentiile interactive avand rolul de a sprijini eforturile de publicitate ale unei companii .
Cum se completeaza acestea reciproc ?
In timp ce o agentie tradițional ă de publicitate poate oferi reclame la televizor sau la radio , o agentie interactivă poate crea site - uri ca Brazzers , machete și aplică tehnici de optimizare a motoarelor de căutare , poate crea articole pentru ziare on - line și multe altele .
Evolutia rețelelor sociale și multiplicarea numarului de utilizatori ale acestora a ajutat agentiile sa- si diversifice paleta de servicii .
Cu cat mediul on - line isi continua ascensiunea , cu-atat agentiile interactive trebuie sa isi mentina evolutia prin adaptarea la trendurile si cerintele contemporane .
Evenimentele de creare de continut sau produse digitale similare pot fi realizate pentru distribuirea pe rețelele de socializare .
Avantajul retelelor de socializare este ca apropie clientii de marca de care sunt interesati si isi asatisfac astfel numite curiozitati .
În publicitatea și marketingul tradițional , clientii sunt receptori pasivi ai mesajelor de publicitate și marketing ale unui brand .
Insa , atunci când se face apel la canale de publicitate interactiva , clientii asteapta reactivitate si adaptabilitate conform demografiei si ariei lor de interese .
Agentia interactiva joaca un rol important nu doar in construirea brandului , ci si in mentinea imaginii nepatate .
Astfel , urmareste indeaproape feedback - ul consumatorilor si intrevine prompt pe nemultumiri , astefl incat business - ul sa nu aiba de suferit .
De ce este vital să angajezi o agentie interactiva ?
In primul rand , o agentie interactiva se ocupa de aspectele tehnice care presupun gestionarea si imbunatatirea design - ului web .
In al doilea rand , amintim partea de marketing si publicitate on - line ( bannere , email , social media ) .
Nu in ultimul rand , orice serviciu adiacent care este necesar in lansarea , sustinerea si cresterea unui business - ului .
Efectiv , agentia interactiva este ca un magazin on - line pentru companiile care - si doresc o reteta sigura si corecta de dezvoltare prin mediul on - line .
Daca detii o companie , cere o oferta detaliata unei agentii interactive si lasa in mana lor eforturile de marketing si publicitate pentru crearea unei imagini si a unui renume .
Profesionistii din cadrul agentiei XNXX pot sa - ti creeze o imagine de la zero sau pot interveni pentru a echilibra elementele care definesc brandul existent si ii pot oferi unitate si unicitate .
Spre exemplu , vor face ca site - ul sa reflecte cat mai bine produsul vandut , astfel incat sa nu existe discordante determinand o economie de timp si castig de resurse .
Acestea sunt caracteristicile care va vor face sa atrageti si sa mentineti clienti .
In concluzie , parteneriatul cu o agentie interactiva te va ajuta asadar sa castigi clienti , timp si sa sporesti cifra de afaceri .
De aceea este vital sa angajezi o agentie interactiva , insa este important si cum o alegi , astfel incat sa iti garanteze succesul .
Transparenta pe care o agentie o asigura , competentele ridicate te pot convinge de profesionalismul echipei si implicit de rezultatul desavarsit .
Foarte important este totodata si implicarea clientului pe tot parcursul acestor procese , pornind de la procesul de analiza a nevoilor brandului si a directiei de dezvoltare dorite .
Aceste pre-rechizite vor contura cerinta si catre terte parti , inclusiv catre o agentie interactiva .
Asftel , chiar daca lasi pe mana tertilor dezvoltarea unui site web , implementarea strategiilor de publicitate , prin implicarea pe partea de validare si ajustare constanta , vei reusi sa iti creezi exact identitatea si renumele dorit pe piata .
The Making of Python
A Conversation with Guido van Rossum , Part I
by Bill Venners
January 13 , 2003

Summary
Python creator Guido van Rossum talks with Bill Venners about Python 's history , the influence of the ABC language , and Python 's original design goals .
Guido van Rossum is the author of Python , an interpreted , interactive object - oriented programming language .
In the late 1980s , Van Rossum began work on Python at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands , or Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica ( CWI ) as it is known in Dutch .
Since then , Python has become very popular among developers , who are attracted to its clean syntax and reputation for productivity .
In this interview , which is being published in weekly installments , Van Rossum gives insights into Python 's design goals , the source of Python programmer productivity , the implications of weak typing , and more .
In this first installment , Van Rossum describes Python 's history , major influences , and design goals .
Bill Venners :
How would you describe Python to developers who have never used it ?
Guido van Rossum : From one perspective you can say Python is a very high - level scripting language .
From another perspective you can say it 's a high - level programming language that happens to be implemented in a way that emphasizes interactivity .
Python shares some characteristics with scripting languages , but also shares some characteristics with more traditional programming languages .
ABC 's Influence on Python
Bill Venners : Could you give a brief history of Python ?
Guido van Rossum :
In the early 1980s , I worked as an implementer on a team building a language called ABC at Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica ( CWI ) .
I do n't know how well people know ABC 's influence on Python .
I try to mention ABC 's influence because I 'm indebted to everything I learned during that project and to the people who worked on it .
ABC 's design had a very clear , sharp focus .
ABC was intended to be a programming language that could be taught to intelligent computer users who were not computer programmers or software developers in any sense .
During the late 1970s , ABC 's main designers taught traditional programming languages to such an audience .
Their students included various scientists — from physicists to social scientists to linguists — who needed help using their very large computers .
Although intelligent people in their own right , these students were surprised at certain limitations , restrictions , and arbitrary rules that programming languages had traditionally set out .
Based on this user feedback , ABC 's designers tried to develop a different language .
Another source of frustration for ABC 's designers was Basic .
At the time , Basic was a fairly crippled language .
Although in a sense Basic was aimed at the same audience , non-programmers using computers , it came from a different language design perspective .
The Basic versions available at the time were horrible .
Almost any interesting Basic program was full of low - level hacks , where one had to poke memory byte 714 to change the screen background color to yellow .
Bill Venners : I remember doing that .
When were you working on ABC ?
Guido van Rossum : ABC 's authors started designing the language in the late 70s and early 80s .
I joined the team in 1983 .
I think we worked until 1986 or 1987 .
For various reasons , the ABC project was n't a big success .
Maybe it was too early , before there was an Internet to do efficient distribution .
Python Is Born
Guido van Rossum :
In 1986 I moved to a different project at CWI , the Amoeba project .
Amoeba was a distributed operating system .
By the late 1980s we found we needed a scripting language .
I had a large degree of freedom on that project to start my own mini project within the scope of what we were doing .
I remembered all my experience and some of my frustration with ABC .
I decided to try to design a simple scripting language that possessed some of ABC 's better properties , but without its problems .
So I started typing .
I created a simple virtual machine , a simple parser , and a simple runtime .
I made my own version of the various ABC parts that I liked .
I created a basic syntax , used indentation for statement grouping instead of curly braces or begin - end blocks , and developed a small number of powerful data types : a hash table ( or dictionary , as we call it ) , a list , strings , and numbers .
I took ABC 's ingredients and shuffled them around a bit .
Python was similar to ABC in many ways , but there were also differences .
Python 's lists , dictionaries , basic statements and use of indentation differed from what ABC had .
ABC used uppercase for keywords .
I never got comfortable with the uppercase , neither reading nor typing it , so in Python keywords were lowercase .
I think my most innovative contribution to Python 's success was making it easy to extend .
That also came out of my frustration with ABC .
ABC was a very monolithic design .
There was a language design team , and they were God .
They designed every language detail and there was no way to add to it .
You could write your own programs , but you could n't easily add low - level stuff .
For example , one of the big frustrations for software developers using big mainframe computers in the 60s , 70s , and 80s was input / output ( IO ) .
All those IO systems were way too complicated .
The ABC designers realized their users ' confusion with IO , and decided to do something different .
But I think they went overboard .
Instead of IO , where you could read a file and write a file , ABC 's designers decided to just have global variables in the program .
Their users already understood the concept of global variables .
So ABC 's designers made those global variables persistent .
If you quit your session , all your global variables were saved by the system to a disk file .
When you started another session , all your global variables were restored .
It worked fairly well , to an extent .
It is similar to the idea of a workspace , for example , in Smalltalk .
There was a print statement that wrote to the screen , and an input statement that read from a keyboard , but there was no way to redirect IO to or from a file .
They literally did n't have any other IO available .
Around that same time , personal computers became available .
Personal computers had all this wonderful packaged software that dealt in files .
There was a spreadsheet file , a word processor file , a graphics editor file .
The ABC users wanted to write little ABC programs that took something from their word processor file and pushed it back into the spreadsheet , or the other way around , but they could n't because of the limitation on IO .
Bill Venners :
They wanted to massage files .
Guido van Rossum :
They wanted to massage data , and the data just happened to be in files .
It made things difficult that the language did n't have files as a concept .
Extensibility in Python
Guido van Rossum :
What made the lack of file support in the ABC language worse was that it was n't easy to extend ABC .
You could n't say , " This language is implemented in C , so let 's just add another function to the standard library that does open a file . "
ABC had no concept of a standard library .
It had built - in commands , but the parser knew about them .
It had built - in functions that were very much integrated in the runtime .
Adding to the language 's standard functionality was very difficult .
For Python , I felt extensibility was obviously a great thing to have .
I already knew we would want to use Python on different platforms .
I knew we wanted to use Python on Amoeba , the operating system we were developing , and on UNIX , the operating system we were using on our desktops .
I knew we would also want to support Windows and Macintosh .
I realized that each of those systems had certain functionality that was consistent everywhere , like the standard IO library in C — but there was also different functionality .
If you wanted to draw bits on the screen on a Windows system , you had to use different code and a different programming model than you would on a Macintosh or on Unix .
I came up with a flexible extensibility model for Python .
I said : " We 'll provide a bunch of built - in object types , such as dictionaries , lists , the various kinds of numbers , and strings , to the language .
But we 'll also make it easy for third - party programmers to add their own object types to the system . "
ABC also did n't have namespaces , because it was intended as a relatively small scale language .
It only had functions and procedures .
You could n't group them together .
Later they added a namespace mechanism , but I thought it was fairly clumsy .
By then I had some experience with Modula - 2 and Modula - 3 , so I decided the module would be one of Python 's major programming units .
I decided Python would have two different kinds of modules :
You can write modules in Python , but you can also write a module entirely in C code .
And such a module can make new types and new objects available .
That turned out to be a successful idea , because immediately my CWI colleagues , the users , and I started writing our own extension modules .
The extension modules let you do all sorts of things : communicate with graphics libraries , data flow libraries , and all sorts of file formats .
Bill Venners :
So if I write a module in C , I can use it from my Python program and the types look just like Python types ?
Guido van Rossum :
That 's right .
In Python , the way to use a module is always through import statements .
Python 's import works slightly different from Java 's import , but it has the same idea behind it .
You import some module name , and the system uses several different ways to locate that module .
There 's a search path .
It looks for files of different types .
If you 're looking for import foo , it will eventually find either a file foo .
py or foo . so ( or foo.dll on Windows ) .
foo.py is a piece of Python source code .
The Python source is parsed and interpreted .
That makes functions and / or classes available to the program .
foo. so , or foo.dll , is a piece of precompiled machine code .
It is usually implemented in C or C++ , but some people use Fortran to write their extensions that will link to large Fortran libraries .
The way you use a precompiled machine code module is , from the Python point of view , exactly the same .
You import it .
You can list the module 's contents to see what 's inside .
Or , if you 're already familiar with the module , you can just start using it .

The global milestone is a reminder of what we have done to control the pandemic , and what more we must do to keep infections and mortality down
I see a lot of confusion about how to use CSS and Javascript with Seaside , so here 's quick rundown of how things work , and what you should do .
There are several ways to include CSS and Javascript for use with a Seaside component .
Unfortunately , the most pragmatic method , is n't the first one you run into when you play with the tutorials .
Method One : On Component Accessors
Seaside allows one to edit both a components Smalltalk code , and its CSS code , via the web browser .
Every component includes an accessor for #style and # script that you can override to return CSS and Javascript respectively .
This is what the built in web browser CSS editor edits .
This is very misleading , because it makes you think you " should " do this , but you should n't .
It 's one of those fancy things that looks cool in a demo , but is n't very practical in the real world .
I think this editor was meant to show off the power of Seaside and Smalltalk , and even to hide Squeak a little for newbies , but this is n't how real world code is written .
This is a method to avoid .
Do n't edit CSS or Smalltalk in the web browser !
Method Two : File Libraries
A slightly more advanced version of the previous method , one can create subclasses of WAFileLibrary for Javascript and CSS , and create as many accessors as one wants , breaking up CSS and Javascript libraries into more manageable chunks .
You provide a # selectorsToInclude method that returns a list of the selectors to include and the framework uses reflection to find them within these classes and includes them in your document .
You can install the libraries via the application 's libraries drop down in the configuration editor .
Both of the previous methods create an include in the HTML document head , pointing to a dynamically generated cachable URL like so ...
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text / css " href = "
http://yourServer/?_s=oOrPOVQrSYfGdvMT
" > < script type =" text / javascript " src= "
http://yourServer/?_s=aIoExcjtxfXNLNHA
"></script>
This method is satisfactory for Javascript libraries , since once developed , they usually require little if any editing .
This also works well for wrapping existing Javascript frameworks so all necessary code is included in the Smalltalk package .
But this method is also not practical for CSS development , because it puts CSS into accessors as hard coded strings in Smalltalk classes , the last place your CSS designer wants to look .
CSS editors do n't work on Smalltalk classes .
Do n't use libraries for CSS , I know it 'll work , just do n't do it , unless of course the developer is the designer and you do n't mind keeping your CSS in Smalltalk .
Method Three : File Includes
This is the only practical method of mixing CSS , Javascript , and Seaside , traditional manual link and script statements in the head tag , pointing to static CSS and Javascript files served up by the web server , directly off the hard drive .
CSS belongs in *.css files on the disk , where a designer can easily use his existing tool set , whatever that may be , to edit the files directly .
This keeps the programmer and the designer squarely in their respective comfort zones , using tools of " their choosing " , to edit " their " code .
Even if you do n't have a designer , and you edit the CSS yourself , it 's a much easier task to do with a real editor on a real file .
This method is simple to use , just override #updateRoot : on your component and link to the files like so ...
updateRoot : aRoot super updateRoot : aRoot .
aRoot javascript url : '/ yourServer/someJsLibrary.js ' .
aRoot stylesheet url : '/ yourServer/someCSSLibrary.css '
This will generate ...
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " / yourServer/someCSSLibrary.css " > < script type =" text/ javascript " src= " / yourServer/someJsLibrary.js " ></ script >
in your head tag , just as you 'd normally have done in any other web framework .
Just because everything " can " be put into Smalltalk classes , does n't mean it should be .
Sometimes Seaside features and flexibility lead one down the wrong path and make you think you " have " to do everything differently than you used to .
But Seaside is fully capable of doing most things several ways , including the old fashioned way , when it 's the pragmatic alternative .
There are times when it 's convenient to use method one , prototyping for example , when you 're in a hurry and just want it to work fast .
Maybe you need to generate some dynamic Javascript for a Google map from a collection of points , in which case the #script accessor comes in very handy .
However , for static CSS and static Javascript , I would choose the third method in almost every case .
As with most things in programming , context means everything , and which method you choose depends on the circumstances at hand , so choose wisely .

The zoo's lion cull is blamed on budget restrictions
The zoo , founded by Ethiopia 's former Emperor Haile Selassie , says it poisons a number of cubs each year because it does not have the space or money to look after them .
" We can send them to the forest and to some governmental palaces but most of the time we send them to the taxidermists , " said the Lion Zoo administrator Muhedin Abdulaziz .
He said the taxidermists paid about $ 175 ( £ 90 ) for each cub and they were then sold for $ 400 ( £ 210 ) .
No -one at the zoo is happy about the situation and local conservationists are angry .
Sanctuary
One Ethiopian conservationist , who did not want to be named , said he had been offered 11 cubs last year .
" They told me I could take and keep them but I do n't have land to keep them ... and it was not easy to get land . "
They kill them by poison and automatically they are taken to the taxidermist 's office
Muhedin Abdulaziz , Lion Zoo
Emperor Haile Selassie started the Lion Zoo 57 years ago .
It collected lions from across the country and was a symbol of his reign .
The Abyssinian Lion is distinguished by its small size and the male 's black mane .
Eight pairs of lions live in the zoo , which is in the Siddist Kilo area of Addis Ababa .
There are currently three cubs there .
Few lions remain in Ethiopia 's game parks .
The conservationist said he would like to see sanctuaries set up around the country for the lion cubs .
" If we have a sanctuary , or maybe we can reintroduce them back into the wild , that can preserve natural resources , " he said .
It is something that Mr Muhedin would also like to see .
Poison
He said the zoo was asking its bosses to expand so it did not have to keep poisoning the cubs .
The taxidermists pay $ 175 for each lion cub
Mr Muhedin said the wildlife office sent vets to kill the unwanted lions .
" They kill them by poison and automatically they are taken to the taxidermist 's office .
Tadesse Haile from the Ethiopian Wildlife Department said he did not have any information about it and that he had never heard of cubs being poisoned .
Between 1,000 and 1,200 people visit the zoo each day .
Meat to feed the lions costs about $ 4,000 ( £ 2,100 ) a month .
The Lion Zoo is also home to baboons , monkeys , rabbits , Egyptian geese and goldfish .
The world 's most modern management - in India
HCL Technologies is empowering its employees and pointing the way to the future of business .
NEW YORK ( FORTUNE ) - I have seen the future of management , and it is Indian .
Vineet Nayar , president of India 's 30,000 - employee HCL Technologies ( Research ) , is creating an IT outsourcing firm where , he says , employees come first and customers second .
" Everybody was aghast the first time I said that , " admits Nayar .
Here are some things I can say about him with confidence :
He is good at motivating employees , very committed to building a great team , but a little shaky on getting things done on time .
These are not my observations .
They are what his employees told him in an extraordinary process of upward evaluation he implemented last year at HCL .
Every employee rates their boss , their boss ' boss , and any three other company managers they choose , on 18 questions using a 1 - 5 scale .
Such 360 - degree evaluations are not uncommon , but at HCL all results are posted online for every employee to see .
That 's un-heard - of !
And that 's not all .
Every HCL employee can at any time create an electronic " ticket " to flag anything they think requires action in the company .
Explains Nayar , " It can be ' I have a problem with my bonus , ' or ' My seat is not working , ' or ' My boss sucks . ' "
The ticket is routed to a manager for resolution .
Amazingly , such tickets can only be " closed " by the employees themselves .
And Nayar is vigilant that managers not intimidate employees about creating or closing tickets .
Managers are evaluated partly based on how many tickets their departments are creating - the more the better .
Nonetheless , I 'm sure it continues to be recommended not to be the employee who regularly posts a " my boss sucks " ticket .
In addition , every employee can post a question or comment on any subject in a public process called " U and I . "
About 400 come in each month , and questions and answers are all posted on the intranet .
" The food served in Sector 24 is stale , " read one recent comment .
Vendors were replaced .
You can't become a manager at HCL until you 've passed a group of courses that include negotiation skills , presentation skills , account management , and what they call " expectation management " - dealing with the expectations of both customers and employees .
There is a method to what some might consider madness .
Nayar has concluded that what he calls the " effort - based " model of Indian IT up to now will not win long term .
That 's because IBM and other global IT companies now have their own local employees and can match many longtime Indian cost advantages .
The winners , Nayar believes , will be those that deliver the best results to customers .
Employees who are secure and happy can better focus on customer success , he thinks .
So he aims to build an organization full of highly - skilled employees dedicated to creating customer value .
He wants to make HCL , which employs 20 percent of its workforce overseas , the place people most want to work .
Nayar is also looking to solve a problem that looms large for Indian IT companies these days : Attrition .
The best employees are increasingly the hardest to retain .
Nayar wants anyone who leaves for a job elsewhere to end up frustrated .
" I want to be the company that gives superior service to my employees compared to everybody else , " he explains .
He also firmly believes the ideas that will guide HCL into the future will come not from him , but from below .
Early signs suggest his bold strategy is working .
Nayar has only been president for a year , a tumultuous one in which most of these innovations have been implemented .
But in that time the attrition rate has dropped in half , he says ; the stock more than doubled - HCL Technologies ' market cap is $ 4.2 billion .
( The company is mostly owned by a holding company which also owns HCL Infosystems , India 's largest PC - maker . )
Revenues last year grew 34 percent to $ 764 million .
In January HCL won one of the biggest Indian outsourcing contracts ever , a three - year deal , reportedly worth $ 300 million , with European electronics retailer DSG (( DSGI.VX ) ) , best known for its Dixon 's stores in the UK .
HCL 's innovations are not only managerial .
The company aims to become a strategic partner with customers by also working with them on business process management and by managing infrastructure remotely , a business it pioneered in India , says Nayar .
It has succeeded with AMD ( Research ) , a marquee customer for which it does all those things .
Another key customer is Cisco ( Research ) , a 10 - year customer with whom HCL is now embracing another form of innovation - shared risk .
Since February , HCL has been completely responsible for engineering one Cisco product .
It gets paid based on how well the product sells .
In engineering all this innovation , Nayar 's humility appears to be a potent managerial asset .
Last week he wrote a letter to the company 's employees marking the anniversary of his taking the job ( He worked his way up over 21 years . ) .
" Please excuse me if I stepped on any toes or hurt any feelings in trying to hurry the transformation agenda , " he wrote .
" I am here as long as I have your support and confidence . "
Do n't you wish more managers had the strength to speak like that ?

Foruten de høyere beløpene snakker vi blant annet null omsetningskrav , høy tilbakebetalingsprosent og flust av gratisspinn .
Nå er ikke slike fristelser noe du bare finner på norske nettcasino , men tilbudene som gjelder her bærer gjerne preg av at det er norske spillere det har blitt tatt høyde for .
Når du i tillegg kan benytte deg av betalingsmetoder spillere her foretrekker , merker du at et norsk casino online har gjort sitt for å møte behov som er vanlige i det lokale markedet .
Uttak kan dermed ofte skje raskere , som når du benytter deg av bankoverføring .
Når penger overføres fra utlandet , kan det ta lengre tid .
Gode casinoer vet å imøtekomme krav , og norske spillere får stadig bedre ting å velge mellom .
Finn de beste online casinoene
Norske casinospillere med et ønske om å gjøre seg selv bemerket , har en tendens til å reklamere for hvilke spill de har i sortimentet som de vet norske spillere liker .
Spilleautomater som Jackpot 6000 og Starburst har gjort furore blant nordmenn , og det hender gratisspinn som tilbys på velkomstbonuser på norske online casinoer er forbeholdt spill nordmenn er glad i.
I et land hvor forløperen til Jackpot 6000 var tilgjengelig som fysisk automat i kiosker og butikker , passer det fint at det finnes gode tilbud knyttet til denne på norske nettcasino på et norsk casino , som Casumo eller LeoVegas casino .
Nostalgien fra tiden da vi hadde landbaserte automater i landet , kommer tilbake gjennom et godt norsk casino .
Trygt å spille på online casino
Du må alltid være føre var når du skal spille på nettcasino , da det finnes mange lite troverdige aktører der ute .
At et casino på nett norsk , er ingen garanti for at det er til å stole på – selv om det er fort gjort å tro det .
Rent psykologisk er det lettere å stole på aktører som snakker vårt språk , bokstavelig talt .
Se derfor om casinoet du sjekker ut har lisens , og om eventuell lisens kommer fra en trygg aktør , f.eks .
MGA ( Malting Gaming Authority ) .
Å se etter lisens er å skille klinten fra hveten – aldri stol på en aktør uten .
De mest seriøse nettcasinoene der ute , oppfordrer dessuten til ansvarlig spill .
Slik gir de inntrykk av å ville ta vare på spillere og motvirke spillavhengighet .
Linker de til hjelpelinjer ?
Kommer de med gode råd om hvordan du som spiller kan sørge for at spillingen ikke går ut over hverken økonomi eller privatliv ?
I et land hvor reguleringen av casinospill er mye strengere enn andre steder , opplever dessverre en del spillere likevel problemer med avhengighet .
Et godt og troverdig casino norsk trenger ikke rekruttere kunder som sliter med å spille forsvarlig , og bør derfor gjøre sitt for å sørge for ansvarlig spill .
Casino på nett for nordmenn
Mange husker fortsatt hvordan spilleautomater ble fjernet fra kiosker , butikker og andre offentlige steder i landet for noen år siden .
Dette falt ikke i god jord , og konsekvensen ble at mange norske spillere heller begynte å spille på nett .
Takket være dette har vi fått et casinomarked med økt fokus på norske spillere , som med tiden kan forvente stadig mer av norske aktører på markedet .
Nye nettcasino dukker dessuten opp hele tiden , og det blir spennende å se hvilke tilbud og garantier skreddersydd norske spillere som vil dukke opp i fremtiden .
Det har aldri vært mer lønnsomt å være norsk casinospiller .
Casino tips og triks
Når du spiller på et casino med europeisk lisens , som tidligere nevnte MGA , er det EØS - reglene som gjelder .
Dersom du er medlem på et norsk casino på nett med lisens fra f.eks .
MGA , skal du i utgangspunktet ikke trenge å betale skatt på gevinstene dine i det hele tatt .
Dessverre har den norske staten etter hvert kommet på banen og krevd at alle enkeltgevinster på over 10 000 kroner skal skattlegges .
Et tips verdt å ta med seg , er at du kan vinne kr 9 000 kroner flere ganger , og så ta ut alle disse pengene på en og samme gang uten å måtte skatte av det !
Norske online casinoer drives nemlig fra utlandet ( som regel fra Malta ) , siden Norsk Tipping har fått monopol fra staten til å drive casinovirksomhet her til lands .
Dette er ikke noe norske spillere bryr seg noe særlig om , ettersom de norske casino på nett som drives fra utlandet gir oss det vi vil ha , og vel så det .
For å oppsummere kan vi si at norske casinoer er mer brukervennlige for nordmenn enn andre , og er derfor lettere å forholde seg til .
Disse vet i tillegg å lokke til seg norske kunder ved hjelp av norske favoritter , og nordmenns forventninger når det kommer til bonuser og kampanjer .
Is e-mail only for the old ?
That 's the contention of a string of articles published in the last four months , the most recent appearing today in the Chronicle of Higher Education .
The Chronicle says that in a study last year , " teenagers preferred new technology , like instant messaging or text messaging , for talking to friends and use e-mail to communicate with ' old people . ' "
The Mercury News says , " For those of you who have just figured out how to zap spam or manage your inbox , prepare for the bad news : E- mail is , like , so yesterday . "
And then there 's USA Today , which makes the claim that " E - mail is so last millennium . "
Those are pretty dramatic statements , and they 're based in part on last year 's Pew Internet & American life study on teen Internet habits .
87 percent of teenagers in the US now use the Internet , and many of them prefer instant messaging to e-mail .
According the report , " Teens who participated in focus groups for this study said that they view e-mail as something you use to talk to ' old people , ' institutions , or to send complex instructions to large groups .
When it comes to casual written conversation , particularly when talking with friends , online instant messaging is the clearly the mode of choice for today ?s online teens . "
This is a problem for institutions that use e-mail as an official communications tool , since students often miss announcements or deadlines .
Unfortunately , IM is n't great for sending out reminders with lots of specifics , such as instructions for registration .
What 's a college to do ?
For some schools , the correct answer is : set up a MySpace page .
After all , there 's nothing hipper for students than being " friends " with your college registrar or school principal .
The intriguing thing about this method of reaching students is that it 's most often not " instant " at all ; students receive messages when they log in or they visit the school 's MySpace pages — the equivalent of using e-mail and a Web portal .
E-mail is n't dying , but it 's grown a little sick .
comScore Media Metrix found that in April 2006 , teen e-mail use was down 8 percent from a year before .
Teens are using IM and MySpace for communication with friends , but they have n't abandoned the tool — that 's why 89 percent of teens who use the Internet still use e-mail , while only 75 percent use instant messaging .
But they have learned its limitations .
One of those limitations is the staggering volume of spam that clogs most inboxes and the aggressive spam filters that make it impossible to know if any particular message got through .
And for those worried that we are raising a generation of children who develop friendships only by staring at their monitors , the Pew report also contains an encouraging word .
Teenagers till spend more time interacting face - to - face with friends than they do using technology .
Previously , I ’ve established that the reason Alex Bunardzic likes my writing does n’t have anything to do with my gender .
The real question , then , that Alex meant to ask is : “ Why does so much tech writing suck ?
And why does some writing suck less ? ”
They are genitalia - indifferent , these questions , and well they should be .
I will address both .
Does It Really Suck ?
You Bet Your Hat It Does
But before I wax onwards , I ’d like to address the unquestioned assumption behind this thesis : that tech writing sucks .
Is there any question that the state of tech writing is a state of , well , suckitude ?
Many of us have been there , struggling to keep our eyes open , beating on our skulls hoping that a little percussive maintenance will help the words on the screen or page make sense .
We ’ve read documents again and again , trying desperately to find the magical missing sentence that will sew up the nagging holes in our understanding holes which , in their size , inspire metaphors like “ big enough to drive the Meow Mix Mobile through . ”
But it ’s not our fault .
We ’re not dumb .
Put simply , the writing sucked .
Does n’t sound familiar ?
If you have n’t been there , you may be one of the very lucky few who can read anything and absorb it no matter what the more technical , in fact , the better .
But trust me when I say the kind of pain I ’m talking about is n’t limited to just me and a select group of froofy visual people .
What Qualifies as “ Sucking ” ?
If we ’re going to try and be pseudo - scientific about it , the best way to determine if writing sucks is to ask :
Does it fail to achieve its objective ?
Which , of course , brings us to our next question :
What ’s the objective of tech writing ?
If we think about it , we will inevitably come to the conclusion that ye olde objective will be either to inform or to instruct , or some blending of the two .
While these two objectives have a lot in common , including the fact that they begin with the letter ‘ i ’ , they are not the same beast .
Objective A : to Inform
Informing , in this case , means helping to shine a little light on the seeds of understanding in your reader ’s head .
You ’re trying to generously pass on your knowledge , thus informing them of something ( anything ! ) .
It does n’t matter whether you ’re trying to tell your readers how you modified your Twinkie - smashing robot to pulverize other snack foods , or trying to convince them to use a new feature of your open - source web development framework .
Informing deals with facts , background information ( hence “ inform ” ) , and so on .
Objective B : to Instruct
Instructing is similar to informing , except that it involves doing .
If you want to instruct someone , you are trying to teach them a process or action or some such , rather than “ just ” information .
In Other Words …
Teaching someone how to write a loop is instructing ; telling them what loops are and why they should care is informing .
Putting it Together
Many tech writing pieces try to both inform and instruct .
In all cases , though , you ’re trying to save your reader from having to learn about “ it ” the hard way , whatever it is and whatever the hard way may be .
I know all this talk about “ objectives ” and “ informing ” makes it sound like I ’m channeling your 7th grade English teacher .
Heck , let ’s toss in “ rubric ” for some good old - fashioned didactic fun !
But the simple fact is this :
Just because we learned it in school does n’t mean it ’s not true .
At first gloss , it seems like all you need to do to succeed at informing is to include all the facts that you think a person requires to continue along on his merry way ; for instructing , you require the steps , and maybe a warning or two against various pitfalls .
Unfortunately , this is n’t true you can create a piece of writing that is component - complete in that regard and still fail in the eyes of the reader .
In fact , it ’s painfully easy to do , as demonstrated by much of the tech writing out there .
Which brings us to the third question we must answer …
How Does Tech Writing Suck ?
So , assuming that the base facts are all there , what constitutes failing to inform or instruct ?
What kinds of stumbling blocks are we facing here ?
What mistakes can you make that would ruin an otherwise good collection of facts and procedures ?
I ’ve attempted to distill the major problems facing technical writing into one , handy little list .
Drumroll , please .
The Sins Themselves
The five major sins of bad tech writing ( and most writing in general ) areeeee …
Losing the reader Making the reader feel stupid Failing to stick Being a total bore Not providing much - needed context
Each one represents the outcome of bad techniques what your reader experiences rather than a specific behavior or tip you can check off your list .
Each one can wreck your piece ’s effectiveness all by itself , but like teenagers and prairie dogs , they often travel in packs .
Now , this list is in short , which I realize is n’t really sufficient to explain what I ’m talking about and why you should give a hoot ( or a prairie dog bark ) .
In long would take pages and pages , and believe me , it ’s coming later .
But later is n’t now and there is no time like the present and so here , for your edification , are Amy ’s Tech Writing Five Sins in medium .
Sin # 1 : Losing the Reader
When an author brings Sin # 1 down on himself , his reader gives up .
Either he literally stops reading the words committed to the piece , or he simply gives up hope of understanding it .
This is probably the worst sin , as once you ’ve lost ‘em , you ’re not likely to get ‘em back and what ’s worse , you might just permanently color their feelings about the technology ( or technology in general ) .
As the famous Gerald Weinberg puts it , authors should always ask themselves : “ After exposure to my work , does the audience care less about the subject than they did before ? ”
If the answer is “ Yes , ” you may have a serious problem on your hands .
Sin # 1 in a nutshell : what the heck is this guy saying ? , this is not worth my time , get to the point already , lay off the adjectives for god ’s sakes .
There are many ways to lose a reader .
Sometimes it ’s because the reader can’t comprehend what the author has written , and othertimes a reader is lost because he can’t tolerate the author ’s style , or the author leaves him without an incentive to continue maybe not even past the first paragraph .
Sin # 2 : Making the Reader Feel Stupid
Kathy Sierra has been hitting us all over the head with her mantra “ How can we help our users kick ass ? ”
She has been telling the world that if you can generate positive feelings in your user ( reader ) , that ’ll rub off on you , your product , or your message .
( Emotional Design is an entire book about this idea . )
Unfortunately , the converse , Sin # 2 , also applies :
If you make your readers feel bad about themselves especially if said readers already kind of suspected they were incapable to begin with that feeling will rub off on their perceptions of you and your message .
Often the worst perpetrators of Sin # 2 do not actually like readers , or get a thrill out of knowing that most of the people who pick up their article / book / what - have - you are “ not smart enough ” to finish it .
If the goal is to disseminate information , this is not a productive outlook .
Do not be this person .
Seriously .
Sin # 2 in a nutshell : do n’t point out that I ’m stupid ( I already think that myself ) , wow you ’re a jerk , maybe I ca n’t learn this after all , it ’s hopeless .
Note : Making the reader feel stupid often goes hand in hand with Sin # 1 .
But as long as she feels stupid AND can continue onwards with the piece of writing , it ’s not the same as Sin # 1 .
But it ’s still not wise .
Sin # 3 : Failing to Stick
Being non-sticky means being generally forgettable .
The content slides down and out of readers ’ brains like spit on teflon .
It did n’t ( necessarily ) made the reader walk away in disgust , or feel dumb , but it has n’t made a positive impression on him either .
Basically , the effect of the writing is net neutral .
Kinda defeats the point of writing in the first place .
Or , for the reader , spending his time reading what the author wrote .
Whoops .
Sin # 3 in a nutshell : I was reading this article on…er , something , did I just read this sentence ?
( over and over )
Note : this does n’t necessarily mean that a piece is boring ( Sin # 4 ) .
A bit of writing can amuse readers with its sentences and paragraphs and still leave them wondering “ What was the point of that article ? ” at the end .
It means that what the author wrote did n’t click with the reader , probably due to a combination of other mistakes , especially a lack of relevancy or context ( Sin # 5 ) .
Or sometimes the author ’s inability to get the article to flow , hang together , or gel .
Sin # 4 : Being a Total Bore
Boringness is the slightest sin , but it feeds the others in a serious way .
The more bored a reader is , the less likely it is that she ’ll remember anything , the more likely it is that she ’ll give up and go away the ultimate failure .
Sin # 4 in a nutshell : Zzzz , the letters do n’t even look like words any more , omg if I have to read this I will die
Like the sin of creating negative emotions , being boring is actually more serious than it may sound .
With a sufficiently motivated reader , it can be overcome , but making people work at reading your writing is rarely a good idea .
As William Zinsser pointed out decades ago in his classic On Writing Well , it ’s not about the subject of writing being innately interesting it ’s about the author ’s interest in the topic being infectious .
Sin # 5 : Not Giving Enough Context
Ladies and gentleman , our final item , Sin # 5 , is probably the most commonly perpetrated sin in the list .
It occurs even in writing that is otherwise excellent .
If you ’ve ever torn your hair out trying to find the secret message between the lines that would actually make the whole thing make sense , well , you ’ve experienced Sin # 5 .
Most commonly Sin # 5 occurs when an author does n’t tell the reader why he should be interested in the piece of writing to begin with .
Or when an author does n’t provide an example of how a certain technique might actually be useful , or a scenario in which a user would benefit from one approach over another .
Sin # 5 in a nutshell : yes , but WHY ?
and this affects me how ?
how can I use this ?
I feel like I ’m missing something
Sin # 5 often leaves the reader having theoretically absorbed knowledge , but completely unable to apply it .
At best , a victim of Sin # 5 is unsure about the usefulness of what she just read .
At worst , the reader glanced at a piece of writing and did n’t see anything that indicated it might be relevant to his life , and skipped it entirely .
Time to Percolate
So , those are the sins .
You ’ve made it through the list .
Hooray !
I hope it ’s been a pleasant ride for you .
At this point , you may recognize yourself in this list , and you almost surely recognize others in it .
And , since you ’ve made it this far , I ’m going to assume you have an itchin ’ to go improve your own writing ( and trust me , it can be done ) or , perhaps , to use a printed , rolled - up copy of this article to train the wandering tech author in your life .
If that ’s true , I ’ve done my job .
But unfortunately , it ’s going to be a little bit longer until I can help you _do_ it .
Note :
If you do decide to do the rolled - up print - out thing , please send me pictures .
So far I ’ve spent this essay highlighting problems without providing solutions .
It ’s bad form to do this , granted , but the full - length piece has become incredibly long .
Since I hope to actually finish it one day , I ’m breaking it up into three digestible stages :
Complain a lot ???
Profit !
Err. Whoops .
Wrong list .
Where can I put my face ?
I really mean :
Describe the symptoms , check Identify the underlying causes ( admitting you have a problem … )
Attack ! ( a prescription for betterment )
This is just step one of a three - step process , it just so happens that this first step is the most negative ( while the second one is probably the least comfortable ) .
Chomping at the Bit ?
If you do n’t want to wait for the next piece to get started on self - improvement ( or hitting people with things ) , here are some things you should read ( or use as weapons ) in the mean time :
Your Next Move
So please , bear with hold the line watch this spacetune in again .
If you ’re not a regular ‘ round these here parts , consider clicking that jolly little RSS button on the left and keeping your eye out for updates .
And definitely let me know what you think !
Introduction
This introduction is presented by means of examples rather than theory , and assumes a little knowledge of Haskell .
Maybe
> data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
> f :: a ->
Maybe b
Example
> doQuery :: Query -> DB ->
Maybe Record
To perform a sequence of queries ( where the results of one query form part of the next query ) , the programmer has to explicitly check for failure after each query :
> r :: Maybe Record > r = case doQuery db q1 of > Nothing ->
Nothing > Just r1 -> case doQuery db ( q2 r1 ) of > Nothing ->
Nothing > Just r2 -> case doQuery db ( q3 r2 ) of > Nothing ->
Nothing > Just r3 -> ...
> thenMB :: Maybe a -> ( a -> Maybe b ) -> Maybe b > mB `thenMB` f = case mB of > Nothing ->
Nothing > Just a -> f a
> r :: Maybe Record > r = doQuery q1 db `thenMB` \r1 -> > doQuery ( q2 r1 ) db `thenMB` \ r2 -> > doQuery ( q3 r2 ) db `thenMB` ....
State
> type StateT s a = s -> ( a, s )
Back to the ( slightly contrived ) Example ...
> addRec :: Record -> DB -> ( Bool , DB ) > delRec :: Record -> DB -> ( Bool , DB )
> addRec :: Record -> StateT DB Bool > delRec :: Record -> StateT DB Bool
> newDB :: StateT DB Bool > newDB db = let ( bool1, db1 ) = add Rec rec1 db > ( bool2,db2 ) = add Rec rec2 db1 > ( bool3,db3 ) = delRec rec3 db2 > in ( bool1 && bool2 && bool3, db3 )
Learning from the experience of Maybe , the wise programmer will likewise define a combinator to sequence together a series of state transformers :
> thenST :: StateT s a -> ( a -> StateT s b ) ->
StateT s b > st `thenST` f = \s -> let ( v , s ' ) = st s > in f v s '
> returnST :: a -> StateT s a > returnST a = \s -> ( a , s )
> newDB :: StateT DB Bool > newDB = addRec rec1 `thenST` \bool1 -> > addRec rec2 `thenST` \bool2 -> > delRec rec3 `thenST` \bool3 -> > returnST ( bool1 && bool2 && bool3 )
It 's obvious that the style of programming shown above - using combinators to manage parameter passing or computational flow - is a powerful technique for structuring code and results in clearer programs .
In fact , the same ideas can be used for many other computational idioms :
Data Structures : lists , trees , sets .
Computational Flow : Maybe , Error Reporting , non-determinism
Value Passing : StateT , environment variables , output generation
Interaction with external state : IO , GUI programming , foreign language interfaces
More Exotic stuff : parsing combinators , concurrency , mutable data structures .
Where 's the Monad ?
Luckily , it was realised that all these examples correspond to the mathematical notion of a monad .
For our purposes , a monad is a triple of a type and then & return operators defined over it so that the following laws apply :
return a `then` f === f a m `then` return === m m `then` ( \a -> f a `then` h ) === ( m `then` f ) `then` h
The Monad Class
> class Monad m where > >>= :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b > >> :: m a -> m b -> m b > return :: a -> m a > > m >> k = m >>= \_ -> k
Now , any type with combinators that obey the above laws can be made an instance of the Monad class .
In the case of Maybe this is
> instance Monad Maybe where > ( >>= ) = thenMB > return a = Just a
Technical Notes : Haskell does not allow class instances for type synonyms , so we 'd need to re-define StateT using a data declaration , and alter the definitions of thenST and returnST to accomdate the type constructor .
using a declaration , and alter the definitions of and to accomdate the type constructor .
For all instances of the Monad class , the above laws must hold .
However , Haskell compilers have no way of enforcing this .
Therefore , there is a programmer proof obligation when declaring new instances
As all monads now have a common notation , combinators that operate over all monads can now be defined .
The prelude contains a few , and there are more in the statdard library module ' Monad ' .
An example from the prelude is sequence : it takes a list of monadic computations , executes each one in turn and returns the list of their results .
Using the combinators of the Monad class , it can be defined as follows .
> sequence :: Monad m => [ m a ] -> m [ a ] > sequence [ ] = return [ ] > sequence ( c:cs ) = c >>= \x -> > sequence cs >>= \xs -> > return ( x:xs )
Do notation
> accumulate :: Monad m => [ m a ] -> m [ a ] > accumulate [ ] = return [ ] > accumulate ( c:cs ) = do x <- c > xs <- accumulate cs > return ( x:xs )
The do keyword introduces a series of monadic computations , delimited by the offside rule , as with other Haskell blocks such as let expressions .
keyword introduces a series of monadic computations , delimited by the offside rule , as with other Haskell blocks such as expressions .
<- is used to bind a variable to the result of a monadic computation ( instead of using >>= )
is used to bind a variable to the result of a monadic computation ( instead of using ) Computations whose result are ignored are simply set in line with the offset rule ( no need for >> )
)
The do statement must finish with a return or a monadic computation ( not a <-)
Further Monadic Classes
Prelude
Monad
Monadic IO
> getChar :: FileHandle ->
Char
One solution to this is to pass the state explicitly to getChar and return a new state .
Generalising , we can represent the state of the entire world by a type World .
The function would now have type :
> getChar :: FileHandle -> World -> ( Char , World )
A solution taken by some languages ( such as Clean ) is to extend the type system to ensure that World values are only used once - Uniqueness Types
However , Haskell solves the single - use problem using monads .
Notice that getChar is simply a state transformer ( over the state of the external world ) and can be rewritten as
> getChar :: FileHandle -> StateT World Char
> data IO a = IO ( StateT World a )
> getChar :: FileHandle -> IO Char
NB : The type IO ( ) is used to denote an IO action that returns no interesting result , i.e. is only important for it 's side - effects .
An example is the dual of getChar :
putChar :: Char -> IO ()
Programming in the IO Monad
IO
As well as IO functions which operate on a per-character basis ( as is typical in imperative languages ) there are powerful functions such as :
> getContents :: IO String > readFile :: FilePath -> IO String > writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO ()
stdin
This is a nice way to get input into a program while still keeping the majority of the program monad - free .
A simple example is the UNIX utility wc , a simplified version of which is :
> import System ( getArgs ) > main :: IO ( ) > main = do args <- getArgs > case args of > [ fname ] -> do fstr <- readFile fname > let nWords = ( length . words ) fstr >
n Lines = ( length . lines ) fstr >
n Chars = length fstr > ( putStrLn . unwords ) [ show nLines , show nWords > , show n Chars , fname ] > _ -> putStrLn " usage : wc fname "
Notes getArgs :: IO [ String ] returns the list of commandline arguments ( like C's argv ) .
returns the list of commandline arguments ( like C's ) .
We then check that the commandline is valid ( i.e. contains one item , a filename ) .
If it is n't we print a message and terminate .
Otherwise the file is opened lazily by readFile and the statistics calculated .
and the statistics calculated .
The statistics are produced using length :: [ a ] ->
Int to count the length of the lists of words , lines and characters in the file .
The first two are produced using the Prelude functions words :: String -> [ String ] and lines :: String -> [ String ]
to count the length of the lists of words , lines and characters in the file .
The first two are produced using the functions and The statistics are formatted using show :: Show a => a ->
String and unwords :: [ String ] ->
String before being output by putStrLn
and before being output by Notice the use of nested do blocks , the interaction of layout between case and do statements , and the do notation 's version of a let expression ( whose extent is defined by layout , so does n't require a terminating in ) .
blocks , the interaction of layout between and statements , and the notation 's version of a expression ( whose extent is defined by layout , so does n't require a terminating ) .
Observe that we must perform the getArgs action and get a result to pass to the case statement .
Doing something like case getArgs of .. wo n't work - getArgs has type IO [ String ] , not [ String ] .
As IO is an ADT , we can't pattern match against values of this type .
action and get a result to pass to the statement .
Doing something like wo n't work - has type , not .
As is an ADT , we can't pattern match against values of this type .
This solution is inefficient -- it traverses the file string five times .
A more efficient implementation would calculate the statistics simultaneously , either using a hand - coded recursive function , or by using foldr .
Summary and Further Reading
There 's a wealth of publications available about monads .
However , much of it is aimed at a different audience than ' Joe Programmer ' .
Here 's a quick summary of some web - accessible documentation :
Theory : Phillip Wadler is one of the guys who started this whole monad business .
blame him ; ) .
He maintains a comprehensive list of his monad - based publications .
You may find some of these hard - going : they get advanced quickly , and the notation used varies from that commonly used in Haskell .
However , certainly worth a look .

A new report in this month ’s issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry finds that while a high percentage of soldiers returning from Iraq suffer from post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , many do not show symptoms right away .
" We can only speculate about why the rates rise with time , " said lead researcher Sgt. Thomas A. Grieger , a professor of psychiatry who works at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center outside Washington .
Grieger ’s team followed more than 600 injured soldiers after they returned from Iraq .
They found that after one month , 4.2 percent had probable PTSD and 4.4 percent had depression ; at four months , 12.2 percent had PTSD and 8.9 percent suffered from depression ; at seven months , 12 percent had PTSD and 9.3 percent had depression .
" It could be the severity of the injury .
It could be that the severity of the physical problems they face hurt them when they ’re returned to an environment where they ’re supposed to perform either in their profession or to be an active and loving father or spouse , " Grieger added .
" The trauma of that could contribute to the development of PTSD . "
Regardless , the finding that PTSD can develop over time means families and friends of returning soldiers must be on the lookout to make sure no psychiatric problems develop .
" I ’d be concerned if they were n’t sleeping well , " Grieger told IPS .
" I ’d be concerned if they ’d given up activities that they previously enjoyed .
Sometimes they call out in their sleep .
Often they have difficult driving or flying or being in other kinds of confined spaces . "
PTSD is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened , according to the National Institute of Mental Health .
A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again .
Also of concern , Grieger said , would be if soldiers are unwilling to talk about their war experiences or show discomfort at reminders of war like civilian aircraft or Hummers .
Researchers found that severely injured soldiers suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder at about the same rate as those returning troops who were not injured in battle .
" The increase from 4 to 12 percent from one to four months is exactly what we ’ve been seeing among non-wounded soldiers , " Dr. Charles Hoge of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research told Forbes magazine .
That ’s hardly news to John Oliviera , a former Navy lieutenant who served tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan before leaving the military in 2004 .
Since returning to his native Massachusetts , he has been in and out of the Veterans Administration ’s mental facility .
" I think they finally figured out the right cocktail of meds to give me , " he told IPS .
" It ’s been really rough .
I ’ve been good lately , but a few months ago I had to be hospitalized after bashing my head over and over again into concrete . "
Oliviera , who worked as a U.S. Navy spokesman in addition to participating in bombing runs , is now employed at the airport commission and as a fill - in talk show host on an AM radio station in New Bedford .
He ’s also started a veterans ’ assistance organization designed to help those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as raising awareness about PTSD .
" There ’s a lot of shame in saying you need help , " he said .
" You know in the soldier ’s mind you ’re supposed to be tough and self - sufficient .
Also , a lot of people do n’t know that the VA [ Veterans Administration ] will cover all your health expenses after you come back from the war . "
Oliviera told IPS that Vietnam veterans have been especially helpful assisting him and other younger vets suffering from PTSD .
According to an analysis published by the journal Science in August , 18.7 percent of Vietnam veterans had experienced PTSD and nearly one out of every 10 veterans of the war in Southeast Asia still suffered from chronic and disabling symptoms more than a decade after the war had ended .
In 2004 , the government continued to compensate 217,893 vets for PTSD , more than the total number of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq .
John Rowan , president of the Vietnam Veterans of America ( VVA ) , issued a statement when the article was published in Science earlier this year .
" Given the nature of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , VVA has no reason to believe that the rate of PTSD for veterans of [ Iraq and Afghanistan ] will be any less than that of Vietnam veterans , " he said .
" The bottom line must be to make sure that the new generation of returning veterans gets the assistance and clinical interventions they need , so that they do n’t develop chronic PTSD , " Rowan concluded .

Claim : Television news screen shot captures President Bush with an inadvertently humorous caption .
Status : True .
Examples : [ Collected on the Internet , 2005 ]
Is this real or faked ?
It seems almost too good to be true :
Origins : Captions accompanying television news broadcasts have to convey information about often complex topics in relatively few words , a situation which can sometimes produce inadvertently humorous ambiguity .
The screen shot displayed above , presumably captured from a Sky News ( Ireland ) broadcast , uses a text caption in conjunction with a video clip of President Bush to convey that the President had declared Hurricane Katrina to be “ one of the worst disasters to hit the U.S. ”
Without the video context however , the caption could be read as labeling President Bush “ one of the worst disasters ever to hit the U.S. , ”
especially given the lack of quotation marks to offset the phrase and indicate it was a paraphrase of his words rather than the news agency ’s descriptor .

Yes and no .
Yes , in that it lets you get closer to your customers .
There ’s nothing quite like talking to your customers one on one to find out exactly what they think of your product , of your company , how they found you , and everything else .
Having a phone number also gives some credibility to your company .
No , because phone support is extremely costly .
Most people do n’t realize it , but phone support is several times more expensive than online support for the same customer base !
As well , although it increases the sales , it ’s nowhere near in proportion to the extra costs .
I now understand why pretty much every software company charges for phone support .
So is it a viable option ?
Maybe…
Rather than debate the hypothetical , I ’m going to share our latest experience with free phone support and our prototype project here at LandlordMax .
There ’s nothing better than a case study !
The results might be different for you and your company , but this is what happened for us .
When I first started LandlordMax , I offered support through email only .
In the beginning it was pretty simple , I could manage it all through my email client .
As the company grew , the support needs grew where we ended up purchasing a customer support system called FogBugz ( allowing multiple people to manage support through a web application ) .
As our needs continued to grow and exceeded even this software ( we still actively use it for project management and bug tracking , it ’s strong suite ) , we moved up to HelpSpot which is focused on customer service .
This is an online system which accepts requests by email , through online forms , etc .
All requests are allocated a ticket number and everyone also receives an online link where they can view the details of the request directly online if they want ( including every detail , from how long it took to respond , and so on ) .
This is great because it alleviates a lot of the issues with people who have very aggressive spam filters ( because we ’re a real estate based business , sometimes we need to use words such as “ mortgage ” , etc. , which are often wrongly picked up as spam by email filters ) .
Because of the way our customer service system works , we ’re able to offer free unlimited online support which is guaranteed to be answered within 1 - 2 business days ( generally we answer it on the same day ) .
This is great because most of our competitors charge for ANY support , and some quite a bit !
Never mind phone support which I ’ll get to in a minute .
About three months ago we decided that we wanted to start offering free phone support to our customers .
Up until now , that is for the past 3 - 4 years , as I just described , we ’ve been offering online support only ( email , web forms , etc. ) .
We wanted to see if it made a difference , how much , and if we could offer it for free .
You see , although I could charge for phone support like our competitors , I really do n’t like this option .
To give you an idea of the market , most of our competitors charge between $ 100 - 200 / hour for phone support !!!
Some only offer email support if you buy a support contract .
Another competitor will only sell you their software if you also buy a minimum support service package of $ 200 !
Personally I do n’t believe in this .
If you buy a product , you should n’t have to pay to get some help in answering your questions .
I understand there is a place for premium support , for example a guaranteed response within 24 hours , etc. , but this was n’t out goal today .
I also do understand the business behind it , phone support does cost money .
And let me assure you , it really does cost quite a bit .
Not just in technology or service costs , but in man-hours !
Man -hours are your largest cost factor , no doubt about it .
Anyways , what we decided to do was offer free unlimited phone support for 3 months as a trial experiment to see if it was a viable option for us .
Hopefully by offering phone support this would increase our customer ’s happiness , and hence increase our sales .
We also decided to use 3 months because it gives it some time to build momemtum
As well , perhaps we ’d also be able to add some extra sales from people who were more timid about purchasing software from a website and would rather purchase it over the phone .
That was three months ago .
Today I know the results .
So let ’s look at the results of our experiment .
Although I ’m not going to share the detailed metrics , here ’s a summary of what happened :
The average time to support a customer increased significantly over the phone versus online support .
There ’s nothing wrong here , it ’s just the way it is .
I would say that on average the time spent responding to a customer increases by 2 - 10 times .
This can be attributed to the fact that some people ask more questions on the phone , some wish for you to wait while proceeding through the steps ( for example waiting for the purchase email to make it through ) , sometimes you wish to wait to verify that the customers issue is fully resolved , and so on .
Overall I would say this is fairly accurate metric for us .

Overall I would say this is fairly accurate metric for us .
For each person who answers the phone you need to train them in your software .
This includes how it works , how to properly answer questions , what the procedures and policies are , etc .
To achieve a good support level this is not a small task .

To achieve a good support level this is not a small task .
With phone support , although we do n’t promise an immediate answer ( we keep the same guarantee of 1 - 2 business days ) , phone calls break people ’s workflow , their rhythm .
For every break in concentration expect between 15 - 30 minutes of lost time to get back to the same productive state .
With online support this can be drastically reduced by answering requests in batches during breaks , or what we list to call “ mental breaks ” ( where you need to look at something different to give you brain a break ) .
By doing this we keep all support responses in blocks and greatly increase overall productivity !
Long distances phone charges do add up …
We ’re using a VOIP system but that ’s also not without it ’s own costs .
Sales have increased , but nowhere near in proportion to the extra costs ( especially if you add in the time costs ) .
I ’d say that we ’ve barely increased sales by 10 % and almost multiplied our support costs by 5 - 6 times .
Therefore it does n’t make sense to spend 5 - 6 times more money to make 10 % more !

Therefore it does n’t make sense to spend 5 - 6 times more money to make 10 % more !
One thing that you really benefit from is that you get real live customer feedback about your software .
I personally found that when I was on the phone , people told me a lot more about what they liked and did n’t like about the software right away .
They also told me what their biggest pains where , which is golden !
Which features do you think we ’re going to add next ?
Probably where our customers biggest pains are !
Therefore , weighing in the pros and cons , it looks like we ’re going to discontinue free phone support .
Actually at this time , we ’re going to discontinue all phone support .
We ’ll probably try it again in the future , things do change , but for now it just does n’t make economical sense .
I can already hear some people saying why do n’t you just offer paid phone support for those customers who want it .
This way you do n’t have to build it into your price and those that are interested can pay .
The reality is that I ’ve found that only about 7 % of our customers ( combined with pre-sales ) use phone support .
I ca n’t speak for every industry , but assuming these numbers , and the fact that we ’d have to charge , I believe that the total percentage of people who would use paid phone support would drop significantly .
Because there is a minimum fixed cost associated to having a call center , we ’d still have to charge a minimum fee per call to just cover the costs .
Assuming only 10 % of the people who use phone support would be willing to pay the fee ( I ’d guess around $ 100 / hour ) , then that would mean 0.7 % of all customers would use this service .
I ’m not willing to risk the significant amount of capital it would take ( we ’d now also have to add a billing system to our phone system ) to support 0.7 % of our customers .
At that point , unfortunately , I ’d have to welcome them to purchase from our competitors .
As you can see , it ’s not that I do n’t want to offer phone support for LandlordMax , it ’s just that it ’s not a viable option for us .
And yes I understand that some people will not purchase anything from a company that does n’t offer phone support , but that ’s ok .
I ’m willing to lose that very very small percentage of customers .
Assuming they ’re 10 % of the 0.7 % of customers willing to pay for phone support , we ’d be losing 0.07 % of our potential customers .
Therefore , to answer the question based on our experiment , is it viable for software companies to offer technical phone support .
Again the answer is yes and no .
It depends on your market and who you are :
Software under $ 100
I seriously doubt you can do it for free .
I also doubt you can charge for it either !
Unless you have economies of scale and you can seriously amortize your costs , no one is going to pay you the price of your software for assistance !
And if you did offer phone support , it could n’t be more than one call for free at best , if that .
I looked up Quicken , a large company that can use the advantage of economies of scale , and they only offer free phone support for installation , purchase related questions , etc .
After that , any help within the software ( for example how to setup a bank , etc. ) will cost you $ 24.95 per issue , or 86 % of the purchase price !
Software between $ 100 - $ 250
You ’d still be hard pressed , but you might have a chance .
Of course you could only offer one incident at most , and every additional call would have to be charged .
Also if your company is smaller than a medium sized company ( $ 10 million plus in annual revenue ) , I just do n’t see how you could offer free phone support .
Software between $ 250 - $ 1000
Possibly .
Here ’s where it gets interesting .
I think in this case the industry and specifics of the software will determine whether you can or not .
To give you an idea of just how difficult it still is at this level of pricing , Microsoft Office only offers you two free phone support sessions and then they charge you $ 35 per additional incident , all this for a product that costs $ 399 for the “ standard ” edition !
Software over $ 1000
Generally software over $ 1000 comes with some sort of SLA ( Service Level Agreement ) .
The more expensive the more comprehensive the agreement .
Under $ 5000 it will be somewhat limited , but over $ 30,000 it becomes generally becomes much more comprehensive ( before LandlordMax I had only worked with one company that sold software for under $ 30,000 ) .
Often in these markets there are a limited number of customers , and the vast majority are corporations where phone support is expected as part of the SLA ( would n’t you expect it if you paid $ 1 million for a software package ) .
So all said and done , looking at our cost to benefit ratios , it looks like we ’ll have to end our phone support for now .
There ’s not much to debate about .
Like I said earlier , we ’ll probably try it again in the future , maybe next year …
I do n’t know .
But for now , we ’re going to go back to online support only ( email , online forms , etc. ) .
I just ca n’t justify the substantial extra costs for the amount of extra revenue it provides .
This would be like asking a landlord to build a private pool for each apartment unit to generate an extra 10 % in revenue .
It just would n’t make sense , landlords do n’t do that .
To quickly end the discussion , since I know some people will ask , do you regret experimenting with offering phone support ?
Absolutely not !
I think every business is different , and every business should try it !
You ca n’t grow without trying .
Michael Jordan did n’t just start scoring baskets on day one , he tried a lot of things before he figured out just what worked for him .
So try things , test what works and does n’t for your company .
Maybe you ’ll have very different results than we did at LandlordMax .
Please comment if you did , I ’d love to hear about it .
Seems I despaired too soon about not being able to get good - looking fonts in Emacs .
Thanks to Duncan Mak I 've been able to compile and install an Emacs with anti-aliased fonts on Ubuntu .
Here 's the recipe :
Get the XFT_JHD_BRANCH of CVS Emacs , see XftGnuEmacs on the Emacs wiki , and this page from Deling Ren .
Get a further patch , from this mailing list post
Get the emacs - snapshot - debian directory from this arch repository and use it as the debian directory inside the Emacs source tree
Then I had to edit out the build instructions for the - nox variant of Emacs , as it did n't build properly , and to be sure , added this to the Emacs - gtk confflags section of debian / rules :
emacs_gtk_confflags += -- with- xft=yes
After that , fakeroot dpkg - buildpackage - b in the source directory , and some time later , Emacs packages with anti-aliased fonts .
There are some limitations : you need to set the font in your ~/. Xresources file like this :
Emacs*font : Monospace -8
You may also want to fiddle with the Xft.dpi and Xft.hinting X properties to get the fonts to match your desktop environment .
OK , so it 's a bit of effort , but worth it .
Hopefully this patch will mature and make its way into future Linux distributions .
La loi Pinel 2020
Afin d’assurer l’investissement des particuliers dans l’immobilier moderne , certaines politiques motivantes ont été mises en place par l’administration française pour déclencher la fondation de domiciles .
La Loi Pinel est la politique la plus actuelle et accorde une dévalorisation d’impôts aux acheteurs d’immobilier neuf a bu locatif , sous certaines circonstances .
Le dispositif présent de multiples bénéfices pour les ménages et individus est revenu modéré et élevé , celui-ci permettant d’économiser dans ses finances et de prendre part dans le marché de l’immobilier .
Originels Loi Pinel fut mis en œuvre le 1er septembre 2014 et appliquée à l’investissement locatif neuf .
Elle est mise à disposition pour tous Français contribuables , mais ne concerne que généralement les plus fortement imposés .
Applicationnel réalisant un placement Pinel , un individu est capable de diminuer son impôt sur la paye de 12 , de 18 ou de 21 % du montant de son achat , avec cette diminution étalée sur une durée de 6 , 9 ou 12 ans .
Le tarif de l’investissement est aussi borné , celle - ci ne peut surpasser les 300 000 € .
La rationnel est de prendre un crédit pour effectuer l’investissement et du repayé pendant un certain nombre d’années .
Pendant ce temps - là revenu locative de l’achat , en plus de la réduction d’impôts accordée par Pinel , affaiblissent largement la rétribution du crédit .
Quand le crédit amorti est repayé , vous avez donc un logement rien qu’à vous .
Privilèges
Pour mentionner les avantages entendus par la loi pinel 2020 : un investissement dans l’immobilier en temps habituel , va ici permettre une défiscalisation en plus .
Cela veut dire que pour l’acquisition d’un bien immobilier , vos impôts seront restreints sur un nombre d’années de nombreux milliers d’euros .
Et c’est non négligeable : à 21 % du maximum ( 300 000 ) , vous pouvez assembler jusqu’à 63000 € .
Les nombreux avantages d’un gain monétaire si important , sont souvent mentionnés en lien avec la loi Pinel : L’arrangement de la retraite une fois le temps de défiscalisation ( jusqu’à 12 ans ) est terminé , il est possible de continuer d’obtenir les les gains locatifs , ou bien de revendre le bien pour récupérer une somme conséquente .
L’investissement admettra donc une rentrée d’argent additionnelle à la pension de retraite .
Le bâtiment d’un patrimoine le dispositif Pinel permet de devenir propriétaire , et ce pratiquement sans apport .
Il est possible donc de prendre un crédit pour réaliser l’achat , et d’amortir le remboursement de ce même crédit , grâce aux gains locatifs et à la diminution d’impôts .
Ce sont donc des avantages fiscaux et immobiliers qui viennent aider à l’achat d’un bien .
La loi Pinel facilite donc la potentialité d’investir et de se constituer un patrimoine .

From childhood , we are taught that the human body has five senses .
I ’m sure we can all recite them : sight , hearing , touch , taste , and smell .
This list has remained unchanged since the time of Aristotle .
To most people , a “ sixth sense ” refers either to one outside the realm of the scientific , or one that simply does not exist in most humans .
However , ask a neurologist how many senses the human body has , and you might get a surprising answer .
Many identify nine or more senses - some listing as many as twenty - one .
The first category of senses is the “ special ” senses , including the familiar sight , hearing , taste , and smell .
The second category is made up of the somatic senses , which we usually lump under “ touch ” - including our perception of pressure , heat , and pain .
The third category , however , is not nearly as well - known .
These are the interoceptive senses - those that deal with data originating in the body itself .
It is fairly obvious what happens to a person when a sense fails .
Many members of society are missing one or more senses .
It is common knowledge that blindness is the absence of sight .
Deafness , of hearing .
Everyone knows what it ’s like to lose taste and smell as well ; this loss accompanies every head cold .
But what happens when the body loses knowledge of itself is a far stranger occurrence .
The interoceptive senses are lumped together in various configurations , but there are basically three .
The first⁠— balance⁠ — is the sense of the body ’s alignment .
This is the sense that keeps an animal upright ; the famous ability of cats to always land on its feet , for example , is due to this sense .
The organic sense is what alerts the body to its internal condition ; this is how you know that you are hungry or thirsty .
The third sense is known as proprioception .
This , put simply , is the brain ’s knowledge of the relative positions of the body ’s parts .
To visualize this sense , close your eyes and extend your hand in a random direction .
Now identify in your mind its exact position and open your eyes .
Note that your brain was well aware of your hand ’s position , even though none of the “ classic ” five senses were currently detecting it .
This is proprioception .
If you want another example of this sense , try driving erratically enough to attract official attention .
The familiar walk - the - line and finger - to - nose sobriety tests that you will be subjected to are yet more examples of what your body can do - or at least should be able to do- thanks to proprioception .
The loss of this ability is known by several names .
Proprioception Deficit Disorder , Sacks ’ Syndrome , and Descartes ’
Disease are all titles for the same illness , which is a complete and total failure of the body ’s knowledge of itself .
Since it is a rare disorder , it is difficult to say what the premonitory symptoms are .
However , there have been reports that the first symptoms are extremely vivid dreams of lost motor function or physical control .
These are followed by an increasing lack of coordination , culminating in full - blown proprioceptive failure .
At this point , the human mind is completely unaware of its own body .
Sufferers report a “ disembodied ” feeling , as if the mind and body have completely separated .
Oliver Sacks , one of the disease ’s namesakes , reported perhaps the first recognized case of the disorder .
In The Disembodied Woman , he describes the process by which a patient - whom he calls “ Christina ” - succumbed to PDD .
In a matter of days , she transitioned from a healthy and active mother of two to a helpless physical wreck , with no sensation of her own body .
The preliminary testing showed that her nerves were in perfect working order ; she could feel physical sensations nearly as well as she always had .
However , somewhere between mind and body a roadblock had developed , preventing her brain from forming an accurate body image - or indeed a body image at all .
The results of this disorder are logical once one understands the concept of proprioception .
Think of all the activities in a typical day that require the body ’s knowledge of its own position .
If you carry your briefcase to the car while fumbling for the keys , your legs do not buckle because they are currently unsupervised .
Your hand does not drop its load because you neglected for a moment to think , hold on to the briefcase .
Your jaw does not hang slack because you were n’t specifically concentrating on keeping your mouth closed .
But for someone with PDD , these are exactly the type of things that happen .
Currently there is no known cure for PDD .
Sometimes the body self - corrects , but in Christina ’s case it never did .
Like any other sensory - deprived person , victims of PDD begin to naturally replace the missing sense with those that remain .
Christina replaced it with sight .
Since she no longer possessed an intuitive knowledge of where her respective body parts were located , she built up that knowledge herself using her eyes .
If she wanted to pick up a cup of coffee , she watched her hand carefully until she had successfully put it down again .
If she wanted to walk across the room , she had to supervise her feet until she was safely sitting on the other side .
Sitting itself is difficult for a sufferer of PDD ; if the hands are not watched carefully they will either grip the chair with white - knuckle intensity or release their hold , allowing the startled individual to slide to the floor .
In many respects , the body of a PDD victim becomes their puppet .
Each movement must be carefully analyzed and put into motion ; no longer can one trust the body to “ just walk ” or “ just sit . ”
Thus , the movement does not look at all natural ; opening a door becomes a laborious process of extend hand , tighten each finger , rotate knob , extend arm , raise foot , lower foot , and so on .
Meanwhile one must not become distracted from the other foot , and who knows what is happening with the body parts not directly involved in the current process .
Fortunately , PDD is an extremely rare disorder .
It is neither contagious nor genetic , and no one knows what causes the permanent variety .
There is a type that is brought on by massive overdoses of vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) , but it is for the most part temporary with few lingering effects .
A rather eerie set of statistics suggests that , unlike most disorders , the more education one has the more likely one is to develop the affliction .
This factor , as well as the initial dream symptoms , suggests that the disease could have psychophysiologic roots .
However , until we know for sure , this disorder represents one of the parts of the human mind that remains a mystery .
It also proves with tragic clarity the old axiom : you never know what you have until you lose it .
There ’s a big battle of words raging on to define what the hell we ’re doing and why we ’re doing it all wrong .
Are Web services on the Web , or do they have to use SOAP ?
How is low REST different from high REST ?
Does XML / HTTP work better if we call it POX ?
When is AJAX not AJAX ?
Who owns the semantic landscape ?
There are also a lot of people building applications , that do n’t have time to argue how you call it or what it means , just as long as it works .
We call them , “ the pragmatics . ”
This post is for them .
When it comes to designing Web services , there ’s a few choices of architecture style , and stacks of technologies to choose from .
It ’s still undecided which one will rule them all , the race if far from over .
Most people who write about that stuff hope their horse is the winning one .
I ’m no exception .
So I ’m going to play pundit and tell you which architecture style I think works best for the Web , which technology stack I prefer to use :
Architecture style : use the simplest most common solution to solve your problem .
use the simplest most common solution to solve your problem .
Technology stack : see above .
XML over HTTP ( can we please not use an acronym that means a disease ? ) is great for moving structured data around , and shines at encapsulation .
Its loosely coupled document style has too many merits to mention .
Except when you ’re building a UI that needs to talk back to the server , where tight coupling is good enough , and too much abstraction means you ’ll never deliver on time .
RSS is a wonderful way to stream data updates from server to client , not to mention the magical combination that are blogs and feed readers .
It ’s the ultimate query API .
Except when your UI is trying to query the number of unread e-mails in your inbox , and you find out that RSS is anything but simple .
Microformats are amazing in their beauty and simplicity , and let you easily microchunk your content .
Until you fall in the 80 % of problems they were never intended to solve and … well , just do n’t solve .
JSON ( not to be confused with Jason , though they both love AJAX ) is the simplest form of API you can think of , concise and easy to use .
It ’s a wonder it was n’t invented earlier .
Except that it ’s tightly coupled and still envious of what XML can do for you .
AJAX is great even though almost everybody is using it for HTML .
But let ’s not get too tangled up in detail , acronyms are not for describing but for branding .
There ’s nothing like REST , it powers the Web ( can we get a logo for that ? ) .
You ’ll just have to ignore all those big name Web sites we all like to mention that use cookies for the benefit of their users .
And all the REST APIs that violate more constraints than a drunk driver speeding down the wrong side of the road .
RDF is semantic bliss , it gets semantics right and has a thoughtful model for representing and querying it .
You can do amazing things with it .
But most likely your semantic data is not RDF , and still happens to work , and you ’re cursing every time you need to fix Firefox configuration files in all their semantic glory .
The Web thrives not because it uses a strict architectural style and a coherent technology stack .
It thrives because so many sites pay little attention to REST and choose to focus on their users instead .
It thrives because malformed HTML pages include GIFs and PNGs and Flash and badly written JavaScript that just works .
It thrives because people go on the Web to send e-mail , IM , do VoIP and trade BitTorrent files .
The search for the holy grail , the one technology to rule them all , is as old as technology itself .
I ’m fine knowing we ’ll never settle the score , never know whether vi is truely better than Emacs , or whether Eclipse shadows them both .
But unless you ’re a vendor making money on one horse , it does n’t matter to you .
If you ’re a pragmatic developer , you have one tool in your toolbelt that always wins the day .
It ’s the ability to think , ask questions and make choices .
To choose solutions that are best for the problem you ’re tackling right now .
And to keep learning .
Because there will always be some new technology that ’s better at solving some use case or another .
The only architecture that matters is the simplest one you can get to solve the problem at hand .

" It 's good to be home , " Raymond Jones said as the plane from Houston , Texas touched down in New Orleans .
Fema gave Raymond Jones a box for his few possessions
Like so many others he had fled the city in a hurry , taking little with him as he expected to be back in just a few days .
" It 's my birthday on 27 August , the day before Katrina hit , so me and my girlfriend had been out to celebrate , " he explained .
" Basically we had gone home and were asleep when my friend Sean phoned and said : ' Do you know how big this storm that 's coming is ?
Have n't you seen the reports ?
You need to get out now ! ' "
" So we just packed two changes of clothes and left . "
Shelter nightmare
Raymond and girlfriend Jane Stubbs then began their month - long stint away from home .
They first headed to Houston , spending two days in a hotel , before moving south to Galveston , where Jane 's parents live .
Galveston was itself hit by the region 's second terrible hurricane , Rita , on Friday night , but by then the couple had moved on .

The couple spent a week and a half in Galveston , but heard that in order to qualify for the help Fema was offering Katrina 's victims they would have to get into one of the official relief shelters .
So they travelled up to Austin and moved into a shelter at the city 's Convention Centre for three days .
Once there Jane and Raymond were given spare underwear and a box for their meagre possessions , as well as food stamps and the $ 2,000 ( £ 1,130 ) cheque that the evacuees are each being given by Fema to help them get back on their feet .
But as far as Raymond is concerned the experience at the shelter was something they both could really have done without .
" They did n't know what they were doing .
It was basically three days of queuing , " Raymond said .
" Three days with no privacy surrounded by the noise of everyone else there . "
Now after weeks of sleeping on a friend 's floor Raymond is finally being allowed back into his house in the Uptown area of New Orleans .
Social burden ?
Peering out of the aeroplane windows as you fly over the city into Louis Armstrong airport you get the impression that most New Orleans residents must have a swimming pool in their back yard .
A closer look reveals that the patches of blue below are in fact blue tarpaulins covering the tops of houses where the roofs used to be .
And these of course are the outskirts - elsewhere has been much harder hit .
Patrick Callahan kept his computer hard drive with him all the time
" Everyone in New Orleans has known for years that the levees would not hold if we took a direct hit , " he said .
" If we all knew it , how come the politicians did n't ? "
Patrick Callahan , who is returning to the newly opened Algiers area of the city , is similarly bitter .
" I have lived in New Orleans my whole life and we always knew it would n't even withstand a category three , " he said .
" We knew that if we ever did get a direct hit it would be really , really bad and that going to the Superdome would be a very bad idea . "
" I am just a resident .
If the residents knew it , why did n't they ? "
As the rest of the country ponders the enormous cost of repairing and rebuilding New Orleans , politicians and media pundits alike have been filling the TV news channels with their views of what to do next .
Many have been critical of the city 's poor , unemployed residents and the drain they make on the US welfare system , a view which has appalled Patrick .
" You know when people in America want to party , to have a good time ; they all just love New Orleans , " he said .
" But now we need their help , they complain about us being a welfare state . "
How disgraceful that a 16 - year - old boy has put the medical and scientific establishment , drug companies and universities to shame .
Laurie Pycroft was in Oxford when he was outraged to see animal rights protesters marching through the street .
He wrote out his own pro-testing placard and waved it furiously .
Within days Laurie had enthused thousands of students and academics .
The whole tenor of the discussion changed , and a debate at the Oxford Union voted massively in favour of animal research .
It is also a shame that no minister or official from the Home Office , which regulates animal research , was prepared to speak in that debate ; the department wanted all kinds of guarantees before it would consider sending a representative .
We live longer and healthier lives than ever before .
Animal research has improved the treatment of infections , helped with immunisation , improved cancer treatment and had a big impact on managing heart disease , brain disorders , arthritis and transplantation .
My own field , the prevention of genetic disorders in babies , has been possible only because of humane work on animals .
Animal rights activists talk about cruelty and torture , some backing their assertions by publishing out - of - date photographs of " experiments " banned long ago .
This is a misrepresentation .
The work we do is performed with compassion , care , humanity and humility .
I have never seen an animal suffer pain .
All my rabbits , when I worked with them years ago , were stroked and petted every day .
All had names .
I still remember Marigold and Wilhemina , who used to lollop around the lab with me and whose contribution changed the understanding of ectopic pregnancy - the most common cause of maternal death in many countries .
My rodents breed happily , and their offspring are indistinguishable from those of other rats and mice .
The rigour with which animal licence applications are granted by the Home Office prevents work that is cruel .
Some so - called anti-vivisection organisations would have people believe that animal research does not work .
This is simply a lie .
Animals do not give information that is 100 % accurate when applied to humans , but they do provide invaluable information that cannot be replaced by computer modelling , cell culture or human experimentation .
Mice have virtually the same genes as humans , which is why they are so useful for exploring human physiology .
Animal research has contributed to 70 % of the Nobel prizes for physiology or medicine ; many award - winning scientists say that they could not have made their discoveries without animals .
Polio would still be claiming hundreds of lives a year in Britain if it was n't for animal research by the Nobel laureate Albert Sabin .
" There could have been no oral polio vaccine without the use of innumerable animals , " he once said .
In reference to a clinical trial at a London hospital in March that left six men seriously ill , the anti-vivisection group Europeans for Medical Progress claimed that " superior human - based tests could have predicted the effects of TGN 1412 [ to treat inflammatory conditions and leukemia ] , where animal tests failed so tragically " .
This tragedy was a rare case , and the best guard against it probably would have been more research on animals before the human trial .
In my view , every drug packet should be marked : " The safety and efficacy of this product were only made possible with animal tests . "
The last big drug disaster in the UK happened because of a lack of animal research .
Four decades ago , when thalidomide 's awful effects were revealed , the drug was returned to the lab to be tested on pregnant animals for the first time .
Birth defects were quickly seen in mice and rabbits .
This prompted an overhaul of the legislation and is the basis for our laws on drug development .
It is time my colleagues got real .
All British universities doing worthwhile research use animals , and , instead of hiding , they should be boasting of their achievements .
Pharmaceutical companies could do far more to promote investigations that are humane , ethical and legal .
Scientists should demonstrate the care taken in their research and the benefits it brings to society .
And government ?
Shockingly , my family feels nervous because I speak out on animal research .
So politicians have a duty to pursue animal extremists with vigour .
Laurie Pycroft 's Pro-Test march , on June 3 in Oxford , is a chance to show our support for science and research .

Compulsory sex lessons for primary school children as young as five are to be backed by the government 's official advisers on sexual behaviour in an unpublished report obtained by The Observer .
If accepted , the proposals would be the biggest shake - up in sex education in schools in England and Wales .
The document says the current system for sex lessons , which are mostly optional , is unfair , confused , damaging to pupils ' health and development and partly responsible for Britain having the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in western Europe .
At present all pupils get basic biological information , but those at some schools are also given details about subjects such as contraception and sexually transmitted infections .
A joint report from the Government 's independent advisors on sexual health and teenage pregnancy recommends that detailed knowledge about sex should become a routine part of all pupils ' education and points out that adopting such an approach makes young people better able to handle sexual issues .
The 42 advisors include senior doctors , experts in sexual behaviour , specialists in bringing up children , nurses , and leading academics in the field .
They want ministers to make Personal , Social and Health Education ( PSHE ) a statutory subject in all primary and secondary schools in England and Wales .
Certain schools provide PSHE to help prepare their students to understand the adult world of sex , alcohol , drugs and bullying .
The Sex and Relationship Education ( SRE ) element of PSHE includes much more in - depth discussion about sexual activity than the factual reproductive biology all pupils cover in science lessons as well as tuition on how to deal with pressure from friends or partners to have sex , where to get contraception and how infections such as chlamydia and genital warts are passed on .
The report , ' Personal , Social and Health Education in schools : Time for Action ' , has been compiled by the Independent Advisory Groups on Sexual Health and Teenage Pregnancy , which advise the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills .
Labour peer Joyce Gould , who chaired the inquiry , said last night that the government should make PSHE a statutory part of the national curriculum in order to tackle the high number of teenage girls becoming pregnant , the rising levels of sexually transmitted infections and widespread ignorance among young people about sex .
Gould denied the group 's proposals would encourage promiscuity .
' Some people will say that if you do n't tell them about it , they wo n't do it .
But real life shows that 's not the case .
More and more young people are having sex at a younger age . '
If implemented , primary school children would be taught mainly about emotional issues such as relationships and friendships , with older ones starting to learn about puberty .
Only secondary students would discuss sexual activity and its potential pitfalls .
Gill Frances , the acting chairwoman of the teenage pregnancy advisors , said SRE was vital to help pupils understand complicated sexual issues .
' Young people are growing up in an increasingly sexualised society , where there are mixed messages about sex .
The result is that they end up confused because they do n't understand what sex is all about . '
Frances said that mandatory PSHE would make many young people more likely to postpone their first sexual experience , and more confident at engaging with the opposite sex .
The report shows that teenage pregnancy in Liverpool , Bradford and Hackney , in east London , fell after local schools introduced PSHE and SRE .
Members of the two advisory groups believe that junior ministers at the DFES and DoH , such as Beverley Hughes , the minister for children , young people and families , and public health minister Caroline Flint , are sympathetic to their plea .
But education secretary Ruth Kelly , a devout Catholic , is thought likely to oppose such a dramatic extension of pupils ' knowledge about sex .
The growing number of faith schools could also make implementing PSHE difficult .
Parents can currently remove a child from SRE if they are unhappy with the content .
Ivy Leaguers were evacuated first from Lebanon
RAW STORY
Published : Friday July 21 , 2006
Ivy Leaguers were evacuated first from Lebanon by private security firms , while students from other schools had to wait days for the United States Embassy to make arrangements , according to ABC News .
" When fighting broke out in Lebanon , college students studying there for the summer anxiously awaited their turn to evacuate , " reports ABC's The Blotter .
" As it turns out , if you were an Ivy League student in Beirut , your turn came first . "
" Harvard , Princeton and Yale are insured by International SOS and Medex , two private security companies , " reports the Blotter .
International SOS have organized three evacuations since last Saturday .
A press release says that the firm 's Lebanon Crisis Management team includes " 50 people across different alarm centres and on the ground " who " have worked round the clock to achieve the mission of providing support to our clients and moving them to a safe environment . "
" Arriving with well - equipped teams , these companies arranged everything for students from land - and air - route evacuations , to hotel rooms , to cold bottles of water at the Syrian border , " ABC's The Blotter reports .
" International SOS did a fantastic job , " Robert Mitchell , Director of Communications at Harvard University , told ABC .
Students left behind were upset at their schools and the government .
" One student who wanted to remain anonymous for security reasons said , ' It was unfair that the private , wealthy schools were afforded the luxury of a quick evacuation , ' " ABC reports .
" Both her university and her government , she says , failed to help her out of a dangerous situation . "
One Harvard student who was evacuated quickly by International SOS still was n't happy with the government .
In an email to ABC , the student said that the situation in Lebanon " has shown how horrible the State Department has been in evacuating people keeping people informed and not causing a state of panic . "
The lower Erigone spider is in a pre-parachuting posture known as the “ tip - toe ” position ( Image : Rothamsted Research )
The mystery of how spiders use silk “ parachutes ” to carry them hundreds of miles – sometimes across open ocean – may have been explained by a new model .
Spiders use simple parachutes to ride the wind wherever it may take them .
The tiny creatures , weighing only a few milligrams , typically crawl up to the edge of a blade of grass , stick their backside in the air and release a thin line of silk , like that used to build their webs .
This “ dragline silk ” is so fine that it encounters an unusual amount of air friction and , as a result , it acts like a parachute .
Each gust of wind can pull the spiders , such as Erigone atra and Tenuiphantes tenius , further into the air .

Researchers previously used mathematical models to estimate how far the spiders could travel using dragline silk .
But these simulations could not explain the long distances spiders can travel : they are often the first species to colonise new volcanic islands , sometimes isolated from other land by as much as 200 miles .
Nor could the older models explain why parachuting spiders are found at remarkable heights , typically occupied by high altitude aircraft .
Silky skills
Part of the problem is that previous models do not take into account the flexibility of the spiders ’ silk draglines , explains Dave Bohan of Rothamsted Research , an agricultural science institute in Harpenden , Hertfordshire , UK .
His team re-modelled the equations to take this flexibility into account .
The revamped models treat the dragline similarly to a yo - yo string instead of as a fixed - length thread .
And these simulations seem to match up with the long - distance reality of spider travel .
While most of this work is theoretical , the team is currently measuring the flexibility of real silk draglines .
They hope to plug this real - world information into the revamped equations to calculate a limit on how far parachuting spiders can travel .
Bohan believes that understanding the way spiders can parachute into areas could one day even help reduce farmers ’ pesticide use as spiders are prime predators of bugs such as aphids , which devastate food crops .

The largest study ever to ask whether a low - fat diet reduces the risk of getting cancer or heart disease has found that the diet has no effect .
The $ 415 million federal study involved nearly 49,000 women ages 50 to 79 who were followed for eight years .
In the end , those assigned to a low - fat diet had the same rates of breast cancer , colon cancer , heart attacks and strokes as those who ate whatever they pleased , researchers are reporting today .
" These studies are revolutionary , " said Dr. Jules Hirsch , physician in chief emeritus at Rockefeller University in New York City , who has spent a lifetime studying the effects of diets on weight and health .
" They should put a stop to this era of thinking that we have all the information we need to change the whole national diet and make everybody healthy . "
The study , published in today 's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association , was not just an ordinary study , said Dr. Michael Thun , who directs epidemiological research for the American Cancer Society .
It was so large and so expensive , Dr. Thun said , that it was " the Rolls - Royce of studies . "
As such , he added , it is likely to be the final word .
After his arrest on Tuesday for attempting to seduce an undercover cop , Deputy Press Secretary Brian Doyle was suspended by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) .
This is clearly a mistake .
The DHS should merely demote him : far from being a criminal , Brian is just another victim of the Peter Principle .
He belongs at an airport , wielding a wand and a uniform , rather than in the PR office at DHS headquarters .
I predict that with a wee bit of training , Brian will quickly become Screener of the Year at the DHS ’s most infamous bureaucracy , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) .
Consider the skills Brian has demonstrated in his enthusiasm for teen - aged girls , and ask yourself whether these talents should wither in prison rather than enhance airport security .
For instance , AP tells us that “ on several occasions , Doyle instructed [ the undercover cop ] to perform a sexual act while thinking of him and described explicit activities he wanted to have with her … ”
Ergo , Brian should excel at ordering passengers to spread their legs so he can stick his wand between them .
I see him eagerly studying passengers ’ stockinged feet , too , la Dick Morris .
Brian may need help with the next step , that of actually molesting folks , because , unlike screeners , he has heretofore contented himself with pecking out words on a keyboard .
Confronted with living , quivering flesh , he may be temporarily paralyzed with ecstasy , akin to an alcoholic who finds himself alone with a full bottle .
That ’s where the training comes in .
With the right attitude , however , our hero should soon be patting down his victims with the best of them .
Brian also likes dirty pictures .
The Tampa Tribune reports that “ Doyle repeatedly request[ed the undercover cop ] … to purchase a Web camera so that she could send explicit images to Doyle… Doyle promised to reciprocate … ”
Here again , Brian ’s hobby admirably fits him for work as a screener since enthusiasm for “ explicit images ” is fast becoming a job requirement .
For almost a year now , the TSA has been threatening to install “ backscatter X - rays machines ” at airport checkpoints nationwide .
These refrigerator - sized gadgets peer through clothes to the flesh beneath , virtually stripping the passengers forced to walk through them while screeners watch .
All in all , Brian ought to be commended and put on the TSA ’s fast track .
Instead , he was entrapped by “ two full - time computer crime detectives ” in the Polk County ( FL ) sheriff ’s office with nothing better to do than “ pose online as teenagers . ”
“ He chose us .
He initiated the conversation , ” a spokesgal for the cops said .
“ This is how we catch predators . ”
No word on whether fear ’s spreading among the approximately 45,000 screeners still at large and preying on us .
Actually , regardless of the crimes Brian has committed against our freedom and the Constitution , he is innocent of the felonies for which he was arrested .
He did nothing but email pornography to another , very willing adult , one who eagerly responded and who played on his emotions by pretending to have survived cancer .
True , Brian “ believed ” the cop to be a 14 - year - old girl , but only fascists prosecute a man for his thoughts .
Unfortunately for Brian , fascists now run the country .
Russ Knocke , Brian ’s fellow spokesliar at the DHS , solemnly intoned , “ We take these allegations very seriously , and we will cooperate fully with this ongoing investigation . ”
On the other hand , perhaps a sort of cosmic justice is at work here .
The Polk folks who nailed Brian hail from the county next door to Orlando’s .
And Orlando was home to Rigoberto Alpizar , whose murder last December Brian helped cover up .
When Federal air marshals gunned down this passenger for disembarking from his plane , Brian stepped up to the DHS mike and shamelessly lied : " [ Alpizar ] threatened that he had a bomb in his backpack . ”
This completely contradicted testimony from eyewitnesses aboard the flight , some of whom vigorously denied that Mr. Alpizar said anything whatever and all of whom agreed he never uttered the word “ bomb . ”
Yet the marshals were never charged in Mr. Alpizar ’s death , and the lie has been told so often it is now “ true ” : a story in USA Today earlier this week mentioned “ the case last December in which a man who falsely said he had a bomb was shot and killed by a federal air marshal in Miami . ”
In his arrest as a pedophile , Brian may not reap exactly what he sowed .
But it ’s close enough for government work .

As the war in Iraq metastasizes into what General William E. Odom calls " the greatest strategic disaster in United States history , " and the cost in lives and treasure continues to escalate , we are already being set up for Act II of the neocons ‘
Middle East war scenario  with the Democrats taking up where the Republicans left off .
The Bush administration , for all its bellicose rhetoric , has shown little stomach for directly confronting Tehran , and this has prompted Democratic presidential front - runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to take on the Bushies for supposedly ignoring the alleged threat from Iran .
Speaking at Princeton University on the occasion of the Wilson School ’s 75th anniversary celebration , Clinton aligned herself with such Republican hawks as Sen.
John McCain and the editorial board of the Weekly Standard , calling for sanctions and implicitly threatening war :
" I believe that we lost critical time in dealing with Iran because the White House chose to downplay the threats and to outsource the negotiations .
I do n’t believe you face threats like Iran or North Korea by outsourcing it to others and standing on the sidelines .
But let ’s be clear about the threat we face now : A nuclear Iran is a danger to Israel , to its neighbors and beyond .
The regime ’s pro-terrorist , anti-American and anti-Israel rhetoric only underscores the urgency of the threat it poses .
U.S. policy must be clear and unequivocal .
We cannot and should not  must not  permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons .
In order to prevent that from occurring , we must have more support vigorously and publicly expressed by China and Russia , and we must move as quickly as feasible for sanctions in the United Nations .
And we cannot take any option off the table in sending a clear message to the current leadership of Iran  that they will not be permitted to acquire nuclear weapons . "
Never mind that Iran is 10 years away from actually producing a usable nuclear weapon , according to the latest National Intelligence Estimate :
" Until recently , Iran was judged , according to February testimony by Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby , director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , to be within five years of the capability to make a nuclear weapon .
Since 1995 , U.S. officials have continually estimated Iran to be ‘ within five years ’ from reaching that same capability .
So far , it has not .
" The new estimate extends the timeline , judging that Iran will be unlikely to produce a sufficient quantity of highly enriched uranium , the key ingredient for an atomic weapon , before ‘ early to mid-next decade , ’ according to four sources familiar with that finding .
The sources said the shift , based on a better understanding of Iran ’s technical limitations , puts the timeline closer to 2015 and in line with recently revised British and Israeli figures .
The estimate is for acquisition of fissile material , but there is no firm view expressed on whether Iran would be ready by then with an implosion device , sources said . "
This administration ’s increasingly hysterical statements on the alleged " crisis , " supposedly sparked by Iran ’s resumption of its nuclear energy program , are  as in the case of Iraq  at variance with the judgment of the mainstream intelligence community .
Once again , the Bamboozle Brigade  a bunch of freelancing " experts , " shadowy exile groups , foreign lobbyists , and a bipartisan collection of pandering politicians  is mobilizing to gin up a war .
These war propagandists , including Clinton , make only the most tenuous connection between American interests and the Iranians ’ alleged forced march to acquire nukes .
Instead , they make the argument in favor of ratcheting up the conflict with Iran in terms of the necessity of protecting Israel .
Clinton ’s speech is infused with this militant Israeli patriotism :
" The security and freedom of Israel must be decisive and remain at the core of any American approach to the Middle East .
This has been a hallmark of American foreign policy for more than 50 years and we must not  dare not  waver from this commitment . "
While Israel is an American ally , so are Saudi Arabia and Jordan .
And do n’t forget the newly installed " democratic " and supposedly pro-American government of Iraq .
Israel " at the core " of U.S. policy in the Middle East ?
I do n’t think so .
Such an Israelicentric viewpoint , while not out of place in an Israeli politician , seems just a mite strange coming from an American  even if she is a senator from New York .
It ought to go without saying that the foundations of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East  or anywhere else  have to be predicated on purely American interests , and that the " core " of that policy has to be our own economic well - being , which is inextricably linked to the stability of the region .
Do we really want to see the price of oil skyrocket to over $ 100 a barrel ?
Is it really in our interests  or the interests of the Europeans , for that matter  for Iranian oil assets to be tied to the Euro and other currencies , rather than the dollar ?
The economic consequences of either eventuality are potentially disastrous for the United States , and yet that is what the reckless Clintonian policy of confrontation with Iran would entail .
Unfortunately , however , the grip of the Israeli lobby in the U.S. is so firmly locked around the necks of certain politicians that any rational discussion of what serves our interests  not Israel ’s  is next to impossible .
It is the task of Israel ’s amen corner in the U.S. to convince the American public , and especially to prevail upon their elected representatives , that Israel ’s interests and our own always coincide .
The propaganda campaign launched to convince us that Iran ’s president is the next Saddam and Tehran is deserving of a little regime - change assumes this , and the Clinton speech is a prime example : " A nuclear Iran , " she avers , " is a danger to Israel , to its neighbors and beyond "  an interesting order of priorities , to say the least .
She does n’t bother making any explicit connection between the pursuit of American interests and this relentless campaign to demonize the Iranians : it is enough that Tehran poses a potential threat to Israel .
For Clinton , that alone is reason enough to go to war .
There is a disturbing quality to Clinton ’s several reiterations of fealty to Israel : it is n’t only the numbing repetition and the brazen pandering , it ’s also the matter - of - fact yet still hectoring tone , the assumption that only one position is possible :
" One cannot look at the Middle East today and not believe that there has been progress against great odds .
Former sworn enemies of Israel are recognizing its existence , are even talking about ways of increasing trade , commerce , and diplomatic relations . "
Surely there are more meaningful measures of progress in the Middle East than diplomatic and economic benefits accrued to Israel  such as , for example , the growing movement in favor of democracy in the Arab world .
But oh no , that would n’t do  unless , of course , any such development is explained in terms of how Israel will gain .
A narrower , more sectarian view of the Middle East would be hard to imagine .
Another of the War Party ’s talking points on the Iran question is the argument that a conflict with Tehran is inevitable , a tack taken by the Clinton - Lieberman wing of the party in seeking to outflank the Republicans on the Right while placing the blame squarely on Bush ’s shoulders : " Part of the problem , " says Clinton , is Iran ’s " involvement in and influence over Iraq . "
Yet she has never voiced regret for her vote in favor of the resolution authorizing the invasion that brought the pro-Iranian Shi’ite coalition government to power  far from it .
For her to decry Iranian influence in " liberated " Iraq , on the one hand , and to continue voicing opposition to the John Murtha out - pretty - soon - if - not - now position , on the other , is typical of her mealy - mouthed , passive - aggressive style of warmongering .
Yet her position is nonetheless clear .
Instead of getting out , she wants to use Iraq as a base from which to threaten Iran :
" I do not believe that we should allow this to be an open - ended commitment without limits or end , nor do I believe that we can or should pull out of Iraq immediately .
If last December ’s elections lead to a successful Iraqi government , that should allow us to start drawing down our troops during this year while leaving behind a smaller contingent in safe areas with greater intelligence and quick - strike capabilities .
This will help us stabilize that new Iraqi government .
It will send a message to Iran that they do not have a free hand in Iraq despite their considerable influence and personal and religious connections there .
It will also send a message to Israel and our other allies , like Jordan , that we will continue to do what we can to provide the stability necessary to prevent the terrorists from getting any further foothold than they currently have . "
A " quick strike "  against whom ?
And what could these " safe areas " be other than permanent military bases ?
Clinton is the first American politician to come out squarely in favor of building what amounts to launching pads for further aggression in the region .
This is something even the Bush administration has been canny about , never acknowledging their clear plans to lay the groundwork for such bases .
Not Hillary , however : she is n’t the least bit shy about her vision of consolidating and projecting American power all the way to Tehran  and beyond .
She ’s intent on out - neoconning the neocons  a risky proposition , given the proclivities of her Democratic base , but one that she embraces , it seems , as a matter of high principle .
If she ’s running for the Democratic presidential nomination , she should logically  in the name of opportunism  tilt left , i.e. , toward the antiwar camp .
Yet she is tilting rightward , or , at least , in a distinctly neoconnish direction : an indication that , in her own mind , she ’s already the nominee .
Surely such arrogance deserves punishment .
Right now , the main political obstacle to the peace movement is n’t George W. Bush and the Republicans : they are plummeting in the polls , in part due to voter dissatisfaction with the way the Iraq war is going , and will be lucky if they can retain control of both houses of Congress in the next election .
The main danger is n’t the GOP , it ’s the DLC  the Democratic Leadership Council , one of the main engines of the War Party ’s influence over the Democratic elite .
It is the DLC that has so far prevented the anti-interventionist wing of the Democratic Party from asserting itself at the national level .
As the Clintonites , the Kerryites , the Kos-folk , and the growing antiwar caucus draw battle lines in the struggle for the soul of the party , the scene is being set for a new manufactured " crisis " over yet another " rogue nation " supposedly building " weapons of mass destruction . "
One of the first signs of this internecine fight is an effort by antiwar Democrats to challenge and oust Sen.
Joseph Lieberman  the most visible and vocal Democratic supporter of the Iraq war , and a longtime advocate of going after Iran  in the upcoming party primary .
One wonders , however , how these " Kossacks " will react to the increasing likelihood of Hillary as our commander in chief : although I would love to be proven wrong , my big fear is that , despite her Amazonian aggressiveness when it comes to foreign policy , these supposedly " antiwar " Democrats will find her Xena - like persona irresistible .
Hurricane Katrina cries out to Congress for something other than business as usual .
Imagine what would happen if each member of Congress announced that he or she would give up a prize slab of bacon so the government would be able to use the money to shelter hurricane victims and rebuild New Orleans .
The public would -- for once -- have proof that politicians are capable of setting priorities and showing respect for the concept of a budget .
Surely Representative Don Young , the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the transportation committee , might put off that $ 223 million " bridge to nowhere " in his state 's outback .
It 's redundant now -- Louisiana suddenly has several bridges to nowhere .
Likewise , Speaker Dennis Hastert could defer his prized Prairie Parkway , a $ 200 - million - plus project dismissed as a behemoth Sprawlway by hometown critics , and use the money to repair the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway .
The Democratic minority leader , Nancy Pelosi , could afford to donate back some multimillion - dollar plums -- just one bike and pedestrian overpass , perhaps , or a ferry terminal .
Another Democratic standout , James Oberstar of Minnesota , would have a hard time choosing from his cornucopia , but that $ 2.7 million for what is already described as the nation 's longest paved recreational trail looks ripe .
The list is long .
Such a gesture by the Capitol 's patronage first responders would encourage a sense of shared sacrifice in the nation .
Members might actually be surprised to see how many of their own constituents are prepared to think of other people 's needs before themselves .
This page has been a longtime supporter of a freight tunnel between New Jersey and New York -- which , we should point out , is actually a tunnel to somewhere .
But we 'd applaud a delay in the $ 100 million for freight - tunnel design studies that was included in the highway bill if it was part of a larger reordering of priorities .
It 's time to put New Orleans first .
Dear Mr. Architect :
Please design and build me a house .
I am not quite sure of what I need , so you should use your discretion .
My house should have somewhere between two and forty - five bedrooms .
Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms can be easily added or deleted .
When you bring the blueprints to me , I will make the final decision of what I want .
Also , bring me the cost breakdown for each configuration so that I can arbitrarily pick one .
Keep in mind that the house I ultimately choose must cost less than the one I am currently living in .
Make sure , however , that you correct all the deficiencies that exist in my current house ( the floor of my kitchen vibrates when I walk across it , and the walls do n’t have nearly enough insulation in them ) .
As you design , also keep in mind that I want to keep yearly maintenance costs as low as possible .
This should mean the incorporation of extra-cost features like aluminum , vinyl , or composite siding .
( If you choose not to specify aluminum , be prepared to explain your decision in detail . )
Please take care that modern design practices and the latest materials are used in construction of the house , as I want it to be a showplace for the most up - to - date ideas and methods .
Be alerted , however , that kitchen should be designed to accommodate , among other things , my 1952 Gibson refrigerator .
To insure that you are building the correct house for our entire family , make certain that you contact each of our children , and also our in - laws .
My mother - in - law will have very strong feelings about how the house should be designed , since she visits us at least once a year .
Make sure that you weigh all of these options carefully and come to the right decision .
I , however , retain the right to overrule any choices that you make .
Please do n’t bother me with small details right now .
Your job is to develop the overall plans for the house : get the big picture .
At this time , for example , it is not appropriate to be choosing the color of the carpet .
However , keep in mind that my wife likes blue .
Also , do not worry at this time about acquiring the resources to build the house itself .
Your first priority is to develop detailed plans and specifications .
Once I approve these plans , however , I would expect the house to be under roof within 48 hours .
While you are designing this house specifically for me , keep in mind that sooner or later I will have to sell it to someone else .
It therefore should have appeal to a wide variety of potential buyers .
Please make sure before you finalize the plans that there is a consensus of the population in my area that they like the features this house has .
I advise you to run up and look at my neighbor ’s house he constructed last year .
We like it a great deal .
It has many features that we would also like in our new home , particularly the 75 - foot swimming pool .
With careful engineering , I believe that you can design this into our new house without impacting the final cost .
Please prepare a complete set of blueprints .
It is not necessary at this time to do the real design , since they will be used only for construction bids .
Be advised , however , that you will be held accountable for any increase of construction costs as a result of later design changes .
You must be thrilled to be working on as an interesting project as this !
To be able to use the latest techniques and materials and to be given such freedom in your designs is something that ca n’t happen very often .
Contact me as soon as possible with your complete ideas and plans .
PS : My wife has just told me that she disagrees with many of the instructions I ’ve given you in this letter .
As architect , it is your responsibility to resolve these differences .
I have tried in the past and have been unable to accomplish this .
If you ca n’t handle this responsibility , I will have to find another architect .
PPS : Perhaps what I need is not a house at all , but a travel trailer .
Please advise me as soon as possible if this is the case ..
This was supplied to me by a friend .
I hope you enjoyed it .

This Is Me Posted by Ogged
on 10.27.06 Setting aside the fact that many performance artists do belong in Gitmo , this is pretty brilliant .
He starts by telling us a chilling story - his detention by the INS at Detroit Airport after returning from a trip from overseas .
An immigration officer scanned his passport and blanched , then led Elahi through a maze under the airport to an INS detention facility .
As a US citizen , this was pretty odd - he tried to talk with the guards to figure out what was going on .
But it all became clearer when the man from the FBI in the dark suit came to talk with him .
Elahi ’s life for the next few months involved dozens of interviews with the FBI ... every trip Elahi took , he ’d call his FBI agent and give the routing , so he did n’t get detained along the way .
He realized , after a point - why just tell the FBI - why not tell everyone ?
So he hacked his cellphone into a tracking bracelet which he wears on his ankle , reporting his movements on a map - log onto his site and you can see that he ’s in Camden .
But he ’s gone further , trying to document his life in a series of photos : the airports he passes through , the meals he eats , the bathrooms he uses .
The result is a photographic record of his daily life which would be very hard to falsify .
We all know photos can be digitally altered - but altering as many photos as Elahi puts online would require a whole team trying to build this alternative path through the world .
Elahi also puts other apsects of his life online , including his banking records .
This gives a record of his purchases , which complements the photographs .
He does n’t put the phone records online , because it would compromise the privacy of the people he talks with , and some friends have asked him to stop visiting , but he views the self - surveillance both as an art form and as his perpetual alibi for the next time the FBI questions him .
This works as a statement because it 's self - evidently absurd , but it's also nothing less than what the government demands when they ask questions like " where were you on the afternoon of ...? " and " do you know Mr . .. ? "
The fact that they only ask for a piece at a time does n't mean that they are n't requiring the whole to be available .
Of course , I do worry that the fact that it 's absurd does n't mean that it wo n't serve as a model for what the government will explicitly demand in the future .

This week 's New York magazine has an article on people trying to extend their lives ( some hoping to the point of immortality ) by eating less .
The blurb for the article is :
Is a life lived on the edge of starvation worth living ?
Our hungry reporter gives the ultra - extreme Calorie Restriction Diet a two - month taste test .
Excerpts : I ’ve been starving for the past two months subsisted on a caloric intake the average sub-Saharan African would find austere a lifetime lived as close to the brink of starvation as your body can stand concentration - camp diets OK , so having read that , take a guess at how many calories we 're talking about .
Answer below the cut .
Excerpts : OK , so having read that , take a guess at how many calories we 're talking about .
Answer below the cut.
2,000 calories .
The guys featured in this article on " extreme deprivation " ( and it 's almost all guys ) are trying to subsist on 1,800 to 2,000 calories per day .
There 's an " OMG !
How does he do it ?!" - style paragraph about a guy who makes sure he does n't eat more than 639 calories for dinner .
I 'm sure the women here are all shaking their heads in disbelief .
For the men who might not understand why this is laughable , read any mainstream women 's magazine and you 'll surely come across an article on food or nutrition that tells women they should be eating 1,200 calories per day and gives you meal plans on how to do it .
Sure , men are bigger than women and need more calories but it 's pretty laughable that guys who have decided to eat 160 % as much as women are told they should all the time warrant a trend piece on how they are starving themselves .
No Truth , No Class Posted by Ogged
on 10.27.06 When Ann Coulter said of some of the 9/11 widows that " I 've never seen people enjoying their husbands ' deaths so much , " Mark Steyn jumped to her defense by writing ,
And at that point Senator Clinton jumped in to denounce the incendiary blond commentatrix as ( dread word ) " mean - spirited . "
Maybe so .
But in 2004 , the Jersey Girls publicly endorsed John Kerry 's campaign for president : they inserted themselves into the political arena and chose sides .
That being so , to demand that they be insulated from the normal rough ' n ' tumble of partisan politics merely because of their biography seems absurd .
And Rush Limbaugh , defending his own decision to wonder whether Michael J. Fox was " acting " to play up his Parkinson 's symptoms , says ,
What 's happening here is that Michael Fox has entered the political arena with his attack , which includes false information about Senator Talent and Michael Steele in Maryland .
That 's fair game , and I am not going to follow the script that says we 're not allowed to comment on the things said by participants , " victims , " what have you , that the Democrats put forth as infallible in the middle of a political campaign .
They 're trying to frame this as the forces of silencing manipulation against the lonely voices of brave truth , but of course the real objection is that the widows and Fox are n't being substantively criticized or disagreed with on the merits , but attacked in ways that are so base and indecent that I think we do n't fully register how low they are .
And , of course , they 're also normalizing just those kind of attacks .
" Hey , it 's all in the game . "
But it 's not , or should n't be .
Another thing to note is how much public reaction depends on who has said something , and the attendant expectations , as opposed to what was said , narrowly construed .
Atrios always notes that there seems to be literally nothing Ann Coulter can say that will keep her from being invited to mainstream talk shows , but that 's not in spite of the fact that she 's always saying horrible things , but because of it .
" Oh , that 's just Ann being Ann . "
I do n't know whether broader conclusions should be drawn from our tolerance for the Anns , and what it says about us that we want our nastiest id out in the world .
More end of civilization stuff , probably .

In the comments , Dagger Aleph writes ,
when I was teaching adults in Cairo , the women were not shy and retiring at all , and would argue pretty strenuously with the men in the class if we were having a debate .
The people I taught there with the strongest personalities were women .
This reminded me that though Iranian society is deeply and horribly sexist in a lot of ways ( and not only because or since religious people took over the government ) , in discussions of society or politics ( which are pretty standard after - dinner fare ) , there 's something common enough that I think you 'd call it a type : the woman who knows it all and monopolizes the discussion .
Happens all the time .
Watch book events about Iran on C - Span , and I 'll bet you 'll see it happen there , too .
In my experience , in the West , this is an almost exclusively male type .
Something else that 's weird is that ( again , just in my experience -- who knows what those other , bad Iranians do ) Iranian men and women seem to have very different argumentative styles , specifically , in that Iranian women will often press a point until you explicitly submit , whereas the men seem as concerned with being deferential and not giving offense as with " winning . "
They 'll concede points all over the place , or not concede with a smile that says , " of course you 're right , but I 'd rather not admit that right now . "
In a lot of ways , the roles of Iranian men and women in argument mirror that of the " respectable " and the " shrill " in American politics .
It 's hard not to see that , in the Iranian case , as a manifestation of sexism .
Much as I love the way Iranian men will argue , with their sly smiles and all the pregnant unsaid , if I were a woman who'd been humored but ultimately blown off that way for centuries , I 'd be pretty damn concerned with pinning someone down .
Issues matter more to Iranian women , because what 's really being discussed when people talk about abstractions like " what 's the appropriate role of religion in politics ? " is often " how should we make the women act ? "
In America , that " mattering to , " or " giving a shit " is " shrill . "
Of course , that 's not to say that there 's no such thing as " shrill , " nor that it is n't very annoying , but it 's good to ask whether what you 're calling " shrill " is just " caring " or " being directly affected by . "

Dear ACLU , Why Do n't You Go Free Some Detainees Or Something Instead ?
Thanks .
Posted by Becks
on 10.25.06 The Education Department recently announced that they are giving school districts more latitude for implementing single - sex classes and schools .
The ACLU and a bunch of feminist organizations are in a huff because they say that it is condoning discrimination and are threatening to sue .
I think that 's a bad move - I went to a single - sex high school and believe I got far more out of it than I would have in a coeducational setting .
I think a lot of what I gained from the experience ties into LB 's post about the lack of female pundits and what m. leblanc had to say about women 's comments being ignored .
I 'd always been outspoken in class but it was n't until I was at an all - girls school that I felt my comments were heard and challenged .
It 's one thing to speak up in class with an opinion and have it ignored or dismissed and entirely another to be engaged and forced to defend it .
I also think there is a type of confidence that comes from seeing all of the roles in the traditional high school filled by people of your gender .
The class president , star athlete , and valedictorian were all women .
And so were the class clown , the weirdo , and the troublemaker always being sent to the Principal 's office .
It really opened your eyes to all of the options you had in life .
And , sure , we dated guys , but unlike our friends at the coed high schools , nobody was defined by who they were dating ( e.g. , " the girlfriend of the captain of the football team " ) .
You had to claim your own identity .
I think a lot of girls could benefit from an all - girls environment and think it 's a shame that that opportunity is currently limited to people who can afford private schools .
I know they think they 're doing the right thing and that there probably will be some cases where separate is not equal but I hope the ACLU backs the hell off .

Phallologocentrism : Now In Pink !
Posted by Alameida
on 10.25.06 m. leblanc makes an interesting point in the comments to LB 's whither whence female pundits post : Maybe I should comment this over at Ezra 's place , since y'all are talking about significantly different things here , but I feel like my political polemic / sparring skills are underdeveloped because I can't find many people to spar with , say , at school .
There were comments to this effect over at Ezra's , but I think many men are just unwilling to engage with women .
I say provocative comments all the time in class , and they are frequently , if not always , ignored .
It could be that what I say is irrelevant , but I do n't think that 's the case .
I see my classmates all the time , going at it with one another , but every time I try to get in on something , it 's like I 'm fucking invisible .
My only real substantive political - type arguments happen with my four female friends , who are totally badass ( sadly , none of them ever speak in class , even though they totally kick ass , thus perpetuating the silence of women ) .
For instance , over drinks last night we got into a heated discussion about psychiatrist - patient privilege .
But the way that we talk to each other , I literally have never seen it , not in class , not in my friendships with men , not on television .
I think in the grad school seminar there is sometimes a sense that women are too fragile for you to really mix it up with them .
Like , they might cry or something .
I can remember that when I would give a presentation in a Classics seminar it would actually get properly attacked by dissenting male students , but when other female classmates presented , there were no attacks .
This was because the male students knew I did n't care and would be happy to argue with them , but they somehow had the sense that our other female classmates would crumble like so many cookies dissolving in tepid chamomile tea .
This was assholish in many ways , but the thing is , there was some basis for this sense , namely , some of my female classmates would become personally offended if you contradicted them .
My sister - in - law , who is in English , feels this way .
She thinks it 's impolite to flatly contradict someone 's view , like it 's a personal attack .
This is very strange , but it is there .
I had female classmates say to me " wow , that guy was really harsh for no reason " , when it was clear to me that he had been storing up resentments about theory the whole semester and finally got to let loose on me .
I feel that not being willing to go for the jugular in attacking people 's ideas is just the same as saying they 're not worth bothering with .
It 's like patting them on the head and saying , " aw , it 's so cute that you think that . "
Philosophy departments are n't like that at all , and the norm is furious disagreement and a certain kind of logico - philosophical cock - swinging .
I love it , but some people hate it .
I would suggest to leblanc that when your male classmates are having some argument you repeatedly come in on one side or the other .
Once they know you like that sort of thing they 'll be more likely to argue with you .
And make your brilliant friends speak up .
Or you could just transfer to the philosophy department ?
It 's really not going to be a solution to the problem of having sexist male fellow - students , but you will get lots of practice in arguments .

Where Are All The Female Bloggers Pundits ?
Posted by LizardBreath
on 10.24.06 Dana Goldstein writes in The American Prospect about the lack of female political journalists ; she blames it on the lack of women in political office .
Ezra blogs on the article , and attributes it to a socialized lack of confidence among women .
I do n't know .
These questions depress the hell out of me , because I 'm working in a similar field , where the key qualities ( beyond , you know , actual competence ) are supposed to be aggression and self - confidence , and despite buckets of both ( at least , I 'm convinced I 'm brilliant , and people are generally somewhat frightened of the prospect of disagreeing with me ) and uniformly good feedback on the actual competence front , I have n't turned that into being a rising star at the firm where I work .
( Yes , yes , I know , the blogging is n't helping .
But it 's a reaction to feeling deadended rather than the source of the problem . )
There 's some personal quality beyond confidence that you need in a law firm to get the kind of experience that moves your career forward that I lack : I think it 's a willingness to make demands of people .
" Them that asks , gets . "
If what I 'm describing is what keeps women out of punditry , I do n't know what to do about it .
But it 's not a lack of confidence in my own abilities , and I think it 's a mistake to confuse the two things .
Update : Check out M. Leblanc musing on the same issues , and suggesting that men do n't want to compete against women because they do n't see us as participating in the same hierarchy they do , so the competition is meaningless .

Drat Yglesias Posted by LizardBreath
on 10.24.06 For being faster than I am .
I had wanted to post on this story ; a typical piece on " Huh .
How come the Republicans are n't getting any political credit for the strength of the economy ?
I mean , wages have n't gone up , and economic insecurity is up , but the economy is doing great !
There must be some arcane reason that voters wo n't give the administration credit for it . "
But Yglesias beat me to it , pointing out that :
Yes , yes , shocking but true -- typical people 's perceptions of the economy are driven more by the well - being of typical people than on aggregate macroeconomic indicators .
Who'd a thunk it ?
To repeat what he said , louder and slower : voters who are swayed by economic issues are n't voting on the basis of whether conventional economic indicators are strong .
They 're swayed by whether their own personal economic states , or future economic prospects , are good .
This is n't silly or shortsighted of them ; the national economy is n't realer , or more important to each voter , than their own particular pocketbooks are .
Macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth are useful for predicting voting behavior only insofar as they 're associated with economic good fortune for individual voters .
Where the macroeconomic indicators are strong , but the economic welfare of individual voters is not , there is nothing even remotely surprising about voting behavior failing to follow the economic indicators .
Part of the mental problem the Times is having here is the tendency to use " the economy " as if it were a synonym of " aggregate macroeconomic indicators " .
If the indicators are up , the economy is strong .
It 's not that this is insane ; it 's reasonable shorthand .
But it 's incomplete .
An economy is a complicated thing that can't be reduced to one number , and it 's perfectly possible to have a ' strong economy ' in which a whole lot of voters feel economically pinched and afraid .
" It 's the economy , stupid " is still true ; you just need not to be stupid about oversimplifying what ' the economy ' is .

I Just Do n't Get Used To People Lying Posted by LizardBreath
on 10.23.06
Or at least being ridiculously , recklessly careless about the accusations they make .
I 've been following all the back and forth about the Lancet study of excess deaths in Iraq ( which I should refer to as the Burnham study , I suppose .
It 's not as if the journal 's editors wrote the paper ) , mostly by reading Tim Lambert 's posts , given that he 's been all over it .
Most of the criticisms looked like nonsense , but one bit from an article in Science , ( the link is to quotes from the article at Lambert 's -- the article itself is subscription only ) , had me worried .
The claim in Science was that the Burnham study was biased because only households on streets crossing main streets were surveyed , and that such streets would be more dangerous than streets not crossing main streets .
The basic criticism struck me as nonsense -- people do n't necessarily die where they live , after all -- but this passage from the article troubled me : Neil Johnson and Sean Gourley , physicists at Oxford University in the U.K. who have been analyzing Iraqi casualty data for a separate study , also question whether the sample is representative .
The paper indicates that the survey team avoided small back alleys for safety reasons .
But this could bias the data because deaths from car bombs , street - market explosions , and shootings from vehicles should be more likely on larger streets , says Johnson .
Burnham counters that such streets were included and that the methods section of the published paper is oversimplified .
He also told Science that he does not know exactly how the Iraqi team conducted its survey ; the details about neighborhoods surveyed were destroyed " in case they fell into the wrong hands and could increase the risks to residents . "
These explanations have infuriated the study 's critics .
Michael Spagat , an economist at Royal Holloway , University of London , who specializes in civil conflicts , says the scientific community should call for an in - depth investigation into the researchers ' procedures .
" It is almost a crime to let it go unchallenged , " adds Johnson .
( Emphasis added . )
( Emphasis added . )
Destroying your data is bizarre .
While there might be good reasons to keep it confidential ( as in this case , the risk that informants will be killed for cooperating ) , destroying the data that establishes the validity of how a study was conducted gives a great deal of credibility to critics ' claims that it was not done properly .
I read that , clearly stating that Burnham had himself said that the data was destroyed , and started to think that perhaps the study was fraudulent .
Or , of course , that John Bohannon , the writer of the article in Science , was lying , or horrendously reckless about accuracy .
Burnham flatly denies having told Bohannon that the methodological data was destroyed : I did not ever tell the writer from Science that the raw data have been destroyed .
Absolutely NOT !
It is sitting right here !
What I did say is that our Iraqi colleagues are very concerned about security , not just theirs but the neighborhoods they surveyed .
They have asked us for the moment not to release the data to others as there might be some identifiers there .
I am sure that we can remove any unique identifiers , but I am bound to honor their requests , as they have staked so much in collecting the data .
We will be discussing this over time with our Iraqi colleagues , and I would imagine that in due course we can make it available to those interested .
...
That 's just amazingly bad journalism .
If you think someone has told you they did something incredibly shady , you check that you 've understood them before you print it .
I sincerely hope that Bohannon is being pressed to provide an explanation for how he made the ' mistake ' .
This sort of thing is incredibly damaging -- it 's fairly easy to correct for spin , or biased interpretations , but I still have a tendency to assume that things reported as fact , and known first - hand to the writer , are going to be true .
And I do n't know how to avoid making that assumption most of the time and still get anything useful out of reading journalism .

If you want an online news reader , Google Reader is very good and free .
It 's not perfect ( it does n't have search yet , for example ) , but it certainly gets the job done .
But despite really really wanting to use an online reader , I 've decided to stick with Great News for now .
The online sites just do n't update quickly and consistently enough for me .
If you check feeds two or three times a day , an online reader will be fine , but if you want to know what 's going on right now on all the blogs you track , the online readers are n't yet updated frequently enough .

on 10.23.06 I miss coming up with coherent , interesting ( for so I flatter myself ) playlists .
But , on the hand , I have no interest in doing that just for my own diversion .
So , does anyone want a CD ?
If more than one person does , I 'll even send different CDs to different people .
Barack Obama will eat your souls .
Posted by Apostropher
on 10.22.06 In August 2004 , I linked to a post about a thread on christian - forums.com where people were discussing , literally and in all seriousness , their concerns that Barack Obama might be the antichrist .
Over the past couple years , it has sporadically gotten comments from folks expressing the same worries .
A flurry arrived in the past few days , all from different IP addresses , including the following highlights :
Hey , I have given prophesy before and I truly beleive that Obama will be the Beast who makes everyone else worship that other funky creature .
He will give His power up to this other creature ( S ) This other creature could be all those Seven or Eight really wealthy people who like own the World and not want everyone 's heart and souls and now they are going to use Obama - his kindess and meekness his sincerity - to gain everyone 's trust .
Beleive me Obama is prolly sincere about his intentions to some extant but He may come to power and realize how good that is to such an extant that he will sell US out - to the more powerful beast .
Obama will be the bridge between the average Jo Schmo who just wants the world a better place to the Anti-Christ who will take these souls away .
Scripture will be fulfilled .
I promise you and if they ever trace me back to this URL I am doomed .
Also because BArack comes from such a multi-cultural liberal background he may turn into a Muslim or something ... and we will die by the sword as SCripture mandates , now these final thoughts are my own ...
----- i have to admit i have been getting a little spooked about this rising star from the middle east .
it just seems to cap off all the other things that have been spooking me as well such as digital angel ( " mark of the beast " ) , these wars in the middle east , this modern day rome that seems to be happening , the weather , these past natural disasters , etc. etc. etc. hope the best for all of you .
-----
Did anyone read the TIME Magazine article on Obama ?
It really creeped me out .
At one of Obama 's speaking engagements he was introduced in the following way : " He 's all of us !
He 's not black !
He 's not white !
He 's not ... "
The speaker then faltered and realized that she was about to say that He 's not male or female .
This kind of a description for anyone is worrysome .
I believe that this is exactly how antichrist will be .
Also , Obama announced today that he will be considering a run for president in '08 .
This going back on past statements that he was not interested in running .
Not to mention that everything seems to be falling into place for end - times events to occur .
Just my humble opinion .
-----
Yes , I believe he will win in 08 and we will be finished by 012 .
I feel in my soul that he is the AntiChrist .
He 's too good to believe .
Where did he come from ?
Where did his name come from ?
What evil forces are behind him ?
----- If Barack Obama runs and wins in 08 '
It will truely spell the doom for America as we know it .
He truely is evil .
We all know this and can feel it in our bones .
Shame on Time Magazine and shame on Illinois .
----- i wouldnt be suprised if he wins in 2008 and i wouldnt be suprised if he gets killed and comes back to life Really , WTF ?
Is it the funny name ?
Does he bear some resemblance to a Left Behind character ?
I mean , I understand that demonizing the opposition is standard operating procedure , but it 's usually a figurative demonization .
Absentee Posted by Becks
on 10.22.06 Even though I 've voted absentee in every election in which I 've ever voted , I was pretty surprised to read that nationwide more than 20 % of voters will vote absentee in the upcoming election .
That seems like a really high number to me .
If I had been asked to guess , I would have thought it would be more of a fringe thing , maybe 2 - 3 % , 5 % at the most .
Brendan Kidwell noted something interesting about the comments on Trackpoint versus Touchpad :
You know , I just realized that there is a lot of LOVE and HATE going on , and it does n't seem to be very unified .
Software development is basically a religion .
It 's not surprising that software developers are predisposed to these kinds of religious arguments .
Pick your poison :
Linux vs. Windows
Mac vs. PC
C# vs. VB.
Net
Ruby vs. Python
Static typing vs. Dynamic typing
Spaces vs. Tabs
.. and so on , and so on , and so on , ad nauseam .
I am reminded of Robert Mitchum 's character in the movie The Night of the Hunter , a preacher with the words " love " and " hate " tattooed on his left and right hands :
Would you like me to tell you the little story of right - hand / left - hand ?
The story of good and evil ?
H- A - T-E !
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low .
L-O -V-E !
You see these fingers , dear hearts ?
These fingers has veins that run straight to the soul of man .
The right hand , friends , the hand of love .
Heavily partisan discussion -- lovers on one side , haters on another -- is n't conducive to civilized discourse .
Jon Stewart 's now - legendary appearance on Crossfire was a textbook indictment of this style of debate .
It 's not debate at all ; it 's pure theater .
Entertainment .
Professional wrestling , if you will .
This is a common problem with online reviews at Amazon and other sites .
The people most strongly motivated to post reviews are those who either :
had such a good experience with the product that they can't stop talking about how great it is .
had such a bad experience with the product that they dedicate the next few days of their life to warning everyone they can away from it .
Either way , you 're getting a distorted opinion based on the select few who had a strong enough negative or positive reaction to spur them into action .
It may be fun to read , in a partisan sort of way , but it 's difficult to distill the vitriol into something you can base a reasonable opinion on .
What about the vast , silent audience who liked it despite its flaws ?
That said , a certain amount of controversy is desirable .
If nobody cares enough about what you 're doing to tell you that they loved it or that they hated it , it 's probably not interesting enough to be good , either .
As Kathy Sierra points out , you should strive for a little controversy :
If you 're out there creating something on the edge , someone 's going to hate it .
Probably a lot of someones .
One thing we noticed from our Amazon reviews was that we get mainly five - stars and one - stars , but not much in the middle .
They either love it a lot or they hate it with a passion .
Whenever I start to feel bad about a scathing review , I remind myself that Don Norman said , " If someone does n't really hate your product , it 's mediocre . "
And mediocre is where you SO do not want to go .
Ever since we started this crazy scheme ( 18 months ago with the release of the the first book in the series ) , we 've been thinking that the extremeness of our reviews was a good thing , and now someone 's confirmed it .
A NYTimes article looks at a professor who analyzed Amazon book rankings for , among other things , a book 's " controversiality index " .
From the article : " But the most telling variable is the one star rating .
Professor Gronas found that books high on what he called the " controversiality index " are given almost as many one - star as five - star ratings , creating a horseshoe - shaped curve .
As it turns out , these books also tend to have high sales . "
The last reaction you want to anything you 've done is a resounding " Meh . "
Go out of your way to create something that will inspire people to love it .
Unfortunately , that means a few people will probably hate it , too .
The love / hate dichotomy has value .
But it 's also important to maintain perspective .
It 's all too easy to fall into the trap of framing your discussions in that old timey religious love / hate dynamic .
Despite the claims of extremist animal protesters , scientists do not in fact relish the use of animals in tests of new pharmaceutical and other chemical products and are continually searching for valid alternatives that might reduce the numbers of small mammals , for instance used in pesticide safety tests .
According to Jennifer Rohn writing in this week ’s issue of Chemistry & Industry magazine , the thousands of test animals currently need for pesticide evaluation might be replaced by tricking ticks into setting up home on a faux cowhide .
The hide , developed by Swiss researchers consists of a skin - like silicone membrane , complete with hair that rests over a layer of cow ’s blood .
The insects are so comfortable with the faux - cow that they set up home , mate and lay eggs .
Currently , some 10,000 animals are used annually to test new tick - fighting chemicals because pesticides to kill Lyme - disease carrying ticks and other insects are constantly being updated .
Thomas Kröber and Patrick Guerin at the University of Neuchâtel confirmed the effectiveness of their test bed using a standard tick pesticide , firponil , and observing central nervous system damage revealed by leg trembling in the ticks .
They report details in the journal Pest Management Science .
Vicky Robinson , chief executive of the National Centre for the Replacement , Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research , said :
This research takes a simple idea and applies it to great effect , resulting in a potentially significant impact on animal use .
Most importantly , it demonstrates that finding ways to reduce the use of animals in research and testing is as much about improving the science as it is about considering the welfare of animals . ’
Obviously , the tick test avoids the need to test on rodents or other laboratory mammals , but it remains a devastating blow to tick lovers everywhere .
? Atty . Gen. Phill Kline often talks about his Christian faith .
But a leaked memo shows how Kline has mixed religion and money as part of an aggressive strategy to raise campaign funds and win re-election .
“ Get the pastor to invite 5 ‘ money people , ’ whom he knows can help , ” Kline told his campaign staff in a detailed , four - page memo titled “ church efforts . ”
The anonymously leaked e-mail memo provides a rare , behind - the - scenes look at political fundraising and the methods the incumbent Republican is using as he faces Democratic challenger Paul Morrison , the Johnson County district attorney .
Kline is a frequent visitor to Kansas churches , often appearing as guest preacher .
But the memo makes clear Kline is out to spread more than the Christian message when he takes the pulpit .
And he wants to hit as many churches as possible :
“ The Goal and Objective numbers , ” Kline wrote to campaign workers Bill Roche and Sylvia Chapman in the Aug. 8 e-mail .
“ Please try to get me in front of the largest crowds as we move through the remainder of the campaign schedule .
Also , please maximize my presence in a community .
Where possible , get additional churches involved .
Am able to preach at several churches where service times are different . ”
Kline office defends memo
The memo was mailed to news media anonymously with a return address of “ Concerned Citizens , Everywhere , KS . ”
The envelope was postmarked in Topeka .
The mailing also included “ event sheets ” that provided details of Kline ’s visits to churches and later receptions on the campaign trail .
On Nov. 7 , Kansas voters will choose between Morrison and Kline , who is completing his first term after narrowly defeating Democratic challenger Chris Biggs in 2002 .
Sherriene Jones , a spokeswoman for the Kline campaign , confirmed the memo was written by Kline and sent to Roche , his campaign manager , and campaign volunteer Chapman .
Copied on the e-mail was Doug Henkle , who works both in the attorney general ’s office and the campaign .
“ There is n’t anything wrong with a candidate turning to his supporters , ” Jones said of the e-mail .
“ There is n’t anything wrong or illegal with the attorney general thinking about his election campaign . ”
She said none of the fundraising occurred during actual church services , but at later receptions .
Under federal tax laws , churches must maintain arm ’s length from political candidates or risk losing their tax - free status .
Jones said the memo detailed a campaign strategy common to other candidates , but also noted the memo was not meant for public consumption .
She said she was concerned someone hacked into Kline ’s personal computer to get the information , but she made no accusations about who may have done that .
Mark Simpson , a spokesman for Morrison ’s campaign , said he had no knowledge of the mailing or its contents .
Outlined strategies
In the memo , Kline also provides detailed instructions to his staff on how to maximize his schedule and efforts to get more campaign funds .
“ Goal is to walk away with contact information , money and volunteers and a committee in each church , ” Kline wrote .
After he has spoken at an event : “ Get me out .
Do not schedule me for social lunches .
Only working lunches were ( sic ) we can obtain either media , money or crucial support , ” he wrote .
“ Work with Bob to try not to leave gaps in the schedule .
If there is a gap , get me to a quite ( sic ) place so I can make phone calls or write ; feed me slimfast .
Do not need a sit down meal .
Takes too much time . ”
Kline also wrote about specific pastors and abortion , which he opposes .
“ Must rework Joe Wright and Terry Fox , ” Kline wrote , referring to two Wichita ministers who led the charge to pass a state constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage .
“ Must get in their pulpits and have them personally host a reception to match Tiller ’s blood money , ” Kline writes , referring to Dr. George Tiller , who owns a Wichita clinic that provides late - term abortions .
“ Perhaps we can get Dobson by phone .
Joe , Terry and Pat must commit to get 5 - 10 people there who can drop $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 .
This will take a lot of work , contact , work , and contact .
This should be early to mid-September .
Get me in their pulpits , ” Kline wrote .
Scientists have created a cloaking device that can reroute certain wavelengths of light , forcing them around objects like water flowing around boulders in a stream .
To creatures or machines that see only in microwave light , the cloaked object would appear nearly invisible .
" The microwaves come in and are swept around the cloak and reconstructed on the other side while avoiding the interior region , " said study team member David Smith at Duke University 's Pratt School of Engineering .
" So it looks as if they just passed through free space . "
The device [ image ] only works in the microwave range of light , so cloaked objects are still visible to humans .
Also , it only works in two dimensions and only for microwaves moving in a plane .
A three - dimensional invisibility cloak would hide an object completely .
The microwave cloak is also slightly reflective and casts a partial shadow .
Despite these shortcomings , however , the new device is " a very good achievement , " said Ulf Leonhardt , a theorist at the University of St. Andrews in England who was not involved in the study .
" It 's surprising that it 's as simple as it is and that it works so well , " Leonhardt said in a related news article about the work in the journal Science .
The achievement , reported online today by the journal , comes five months after the same team published a study detailing the precise mathematical specifications a needed to build such a cloaking device .
Metamaterials
The apparatus was made using " metamaterials , " artificial materials engineered to have precisely patterned surfaces that interact with and manipulate light in novel ways .
Although called a cloak , the device is not something that can be worn .
Rather , it consists of a series of concentric circles , made of copper rings and wires patterned onto sheets of fiberglass , and resembles a loosely coiled reel of film .
The patterns enable the manipulation of light , and the size of the patterns determines which wavelengths of light can be manipulated .
Smaller patterns affect shorter the wavelengths .
Microwaves have relatively long wavelengths and can be affected with metamaterials having relatively large patterns .
Manipulating visible light , which has much shorter wavelengths , will require metamaterials with much finer patterns .
While making those finer patterns is possible with current nanomanufacturing technologies , the metals used to make the microwave cloak would behave differently with visible light , Smith said .
" They act very differently at optical wavelengths ; they become very absorptive .
A cloaked object would just become very opaque , rather than transparent , " he told LiveScience .
But even if metamaterials are made that can deflect visible light , do n't expect the kind of invisibility offered by Harry Potter 's cloak or Star Trek cloaking devices any time soon .
Human eyes are sensitive to many different wavelengths of light , as evidenced by the rainbow of colors that we see , and it 's still uncertain if metamaterials can deflect so many wavelengths simultaneously .
Still useful
But even imperfect cloaking devices might be useful , the researchers say .
Cloaks that deflect radio waves could render an object invisible to radar or improve cell phone receptions by rerouting signals around obstructions .
They might also be used to protect people from penetrating and harmful radiation .
" If you knew that you had radiation of a certain bandwidth frequency , you could have it skirt around some region that you wanted shielded , " Smith said .
The team says the next step is to create a cloak that works in three dimensions and to perfect the cloaking effect .
9/11 World Trade Center Casualties Equals U.S. Soldiers Killed in Iraq War August 16 , 2006

In less than a month the tragic events of September 11th 2001 will recognize its fifth anniversary .
New audio tapes have been released in recent weeks and again today as a way to share with the population further examples of how the victims responded to the events as they were unfolding .
Yet , this week is significant for reasons of a related matter .
It is during this week that the number of U.S. Deaths ( 2,601 ) confirmed by the Department of Defense in the Iraq War will outnumber the confirmed lives claimed in the World Trade Center Towers ( 2,602 ) on that historic date .
This mention is definitely one of symbolism , as everything else I might say has already been discussed .
An Egyptian cleric 's controversial fatwa claiming that nudity during sexual intercourse invalidates a marriage has uncovered a rift among Islamic scholars .
According to the religious edict issued by Rashad Hassan Khalil , a former dean of Al - Azhar University 's faculty of Sharia ( or Islamic law ) , " being completely naked during the act of coitus annuls the marriage " .
The religious decree sparked a hot debate on the private satellite network Dream 's popular religious talk show and on the front page of today 's Al - Masri Al - Yom , Egypt 's leading independent daily newspaper .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 18 — Karl Rove , the top White House political strategist , is coming off the worst election defeat of his career to face a daunting task : saving the president ’s agenda with a Congress not only controlled by Democrats , but also filled with Republican members resentful of the way he and the White House conducted the losing campaign .
White House officials say President Bush has every intention of keeping Mr. Rove on through the rest of his term .
And Mr. Rove ’s associates say he intends to stay , with the goal of at least salvaging Mr. Bush ’s legacy and , in the process , his own .
But serious questions remain about how much influence Mr. Rove can wield and how high a profile he can assume in Washington after being so closely identified with this year ’s Republican losses , not to mention six years of often brutal attacks on the same Democrats in line to control Congress for the remainder of Mr. Bush ’s presidency .
Things have not gotten off to a great start since the election .
Democrats are taking Mr. Rove ’s continued influence at the White House — as well as some of its recent moves , like nominating conservative judges for the federal bench — as a sign that Mr. Bush ’s conciliatory pledges of bipartisanship will prove to be fleeting .

Part I : An open letter to motorists who dislike cyclists .
I ride my bike year - round as my main means of transportation .
My bike is not a toy .
I do n't aspire to be Lance Armstrong .
I 'm not too poor to afford a car .
I choose a bicycle because its healthier for me , and healthier for the city I live in .
I 'm not riding in the middle of the lane to slow you down or thwart you .
I 'm just trying to do the same thing as you - get from point A to point B safely .
I ride in the middle of the lane if the lane is too narrow to share safely .
This is actually a courtesy to you , because you do n't have to guess how wide your vehicle is versus how much space is available , and decide if you have to change lanes or not .
If the lane next to you is wide open , it really is n't necessary to blast your horn or yell things out your window .
Maybe you think there 's room for me to be riding in the gutter , but I really have a better view of the pavement there than you do .
There 's debris there that will flatten my tires , and potholes that can break my bones .
If I need to swerve to avoid some garbage someone threw out their car window , I need room to maneouver .
Its not going to make either of our days if we collide .
While we are on the subject of yelling things out the window , your vehicle is loud .
Unless we are both stopped at a traffic light , it is unlikely I can make out the words you are saying .
Maybe its better to focus your attention on not hitting things that are front of you rather than letting me know " ( mumble mumble ) ... you 'll get hit " .
I also know where the bike paths are , I have a map .
But where I 'm going is not on the path .
Thank you though to the driver that stopped to let me know my headlight made a big difference .
It was nice to know it was appreciated .
I put on lights at night so you can see me .
I ride in a predictable line so I do n't surprise you by my presence .
I do n't weave between parked cars so I do n't startle you when I emerge from behind one .
I 'm sorry I did n't move over so you could use the three car - length gap between parked cars as your personal passing lane .
In an ideal world I would ride far enough away from your car door that it would n't matter if you flung it open when I least expected it .
But the downtown streets are very congested and there 's not a lot of space available .
So please look before you open your door .
I try to make it easier for you by ringing my bell if I see you parking so you know I 'm there .
In limited space world , cyclists are often using the rest of a parking lane .
Please try to park as close to the curb as you can .
You may think riding a bicycle in a downpour or a snowstorm is crazy .
Its actually quite pleasant if you 're dressed for it .
But I do n't expect you to " get it " .
I only expect you to remember that there 's still a human being riding a bicycle out there .
Flooring it through puddles to make the biggest splash possible is not funny .
Passing too close is never a good idea , but in a snowstorm when the roads are slippery , please leave as much space as you can .
While I may appear to be a very competent cyclist , and you may fancy yourself a very competent driver , its still a good idea to leave at least 3 feet when passing me .
While you may not actually brush me when you pass too close , it is still frightening to have 2000 pounds of steel a few inches from your shoulder .
Some roads have bicycle lanes painted on them .
In an ideal world cyclists and motorists should be able to share the roadway without special lines .
But after being honked at one too many times for taking a narrow lane , or buzzed too close by attempting to share one , bike lanes become a place of refuge .
Please try to have some respect for this refuge by finding a different spot to park your car when you want to run into Starbucks , and definitely do not think of this space as the way to get around a left - turning vehicle .
Remember that the bike lane is there when you want to turn right , and that there might be a cyclist in it .
The lanes are dotted near intersections for a reason , you should merge into this lane when you want to turn right .
Note that merge does not mean cut off .
You are n't doing me a favour by waiting to turn right while leaving the bike lane open .
I will never pass you on the right when you are signalling right , as I have no idea if you see me or not .
If you merge , I have room to pass you on the left in your lane of traffic to go straight while you wait for pedestrians crossing etc .
If you do n't merge , there 's no room for me to go around easily .
Remember those hand turn signals from the drivers education handbook ?
I try to use them as much as possible to let you know what I 'm going to do .
While it might seem redundant to signal a stop when approaching a four - way stop , I know that not all people on bicycles stop .
The signal is a courtesy to you , so you know that you can proceed because I will stop .
Sometimes I need my hands on my bike but you should be able to infer from my lane position what I am going to do .
If I am in the left lane of the road it means I am going to turn left .
I 'm not there to enjoy the scenery .
If you want to turn left as well , this means you should wait behind me .
Trying to turn left from the right side of the roadway is only going to put us both in conflict .
I try to make my best guesses what you might do next from your lane position .
You can help take out the guesswork .
While it may seem that the turn signal has gone out of fashion , I really do appreciate when you use it in advance .
This lets me move as best as possible so we do n't have any conflict .
The world will not end if you cannot make a right turn on a red light .
If there was a car in front of you , would you honk because you wanted to make a right turn ?
Because I am small enough to move over to let you do so does not always mean it is safe to do so .
If it is safe , and I see you signalling right in my rearview mirror , I will move over and let you go by .
Please do not try to squeeze between me in the middle of the lane and the car in the next lane when there clearly is not enough space .
Repeatedly leaning on the horn will only get on both of our nerves .
I can move faster than you think .
While you may think a bicycle is too slow to be practical for transportation - in downtown Toronto most of the time , including the time spent to park , I will beat you to your destination .
While you were so anxious to pass me , perhaps you did n't notice that I have caught up with you again at the next red light .
It is n't a race from red light to red light , so if you need to slow down for a few seconds it is n't the end of the world .
Think how much more I would slow you down if I was a full - width car trying to make a left turn onto a side street in busy traffic .
If you cannot judge how fast I am moving please err on the side of caution when turning left in front of me , or pulling out of your parking spot .
But if in your rearview mirror , you see me waving in the direction you want to move it means I see you and you have time to go .
I appreciate your kind attempts to let me have the right - of - way when it is not mine .
Being on a bicycle its hard losing your momentum again and again at every stop sign .
But most of the time its easier if you just go .
If you stop to let me cross mid block the car behind you might get surprised and rear - end you .
I 'm sorry if I break the occasional traffic law , which were designed with the dangers inherent in the automobile in mind .
I may slow down and scan the intersection rather than come to a complete stop at a four - way stop , because its really hard on me to constantly lose my momentum .
I know this is not legal , but its quite safe at bicycle speed .
Just as its not legal for you to be going over the speed limit but I doubt you always are obeying it .
Please try not to get angry at me about this when I not disrespecting anyone else 's right - of - way at the same time .
If you are at the cross street , I will stop .
Recognize though that I am human and make mistakes .
I may have missed the sign that says " caution northbound traffic does not stop " when proceeding at what I thought was a stop sign for both of us .
If we both try to be aware of what each other is doing and compensate for it , then mistakes on either of our part do not have to become crashes .
Its much more likely I made a mistake if you see me doing something " dangerous " as opposed to having a death wish .
If you have n't noticed already , there are a whole lot of people riding their bicycles around downtown Toronto .
All kinds of people find the bicycle useful .
Just as there are drivers deficient in common sense , there are people riding bikes without common sense as well .
I do n't happen to know the Joe schmoe who you saw riding a bike down the center of a busy one - way arterial in the wrong direction snarling traffic .
Please do not assume I 'm going to behave like Joe schmoe .
Or take your anger at Joe out on me by honking or yelling at me from the other side of the road , where I cannot possibly be in your way .
Also be glad Joe was not driving a car where he would be a real danger to everyone .
I am very aware of my surroundings when I am on a bicycle .
I can hear when you are behind me by the sound of your engine .
You do n't need to toot to let me know you are there .
I 'm never sure whether you are trying to let me know you are there , trying to say hello to me , wanting me to move , or whether you are just angry .
I was going to say that in conclusion all I really want is for you to treat me with the same respect you would treat any other road user .
But after noticing the frequency with which motorists hit each other , I would add an extra caveat .
Please recognize that cyclists are more vulnerable road users .
Before you wish them off the road , remember they are helping to ease traffic congestion .
When in doubt as to who should go next , let the more vulnerable road user proceed .
And keep in mind that leaving space always helps road safety , whether its an extra foot when passing a cyclist , or an extra few feet stopping behind the car in front of you .
When we work cooperatively on the roads rather than a mad competition , we can all get where we are going just a little less stressfully .
Thanks .
And thank you to the motorists that already get it .
Thank you for waiting before opening your door .
Thank you for leaving a safe amount of space when passing .
Thank you for waiting patiently behind when it was not safe to pass .
Thank you for signalling .
Thank you for respecting the speed limit which makes the roads just a little bit saner to be travelling on .
Thank you for noticing when I made a mistake and avoiding a collision .
Thank you for slowing to let me in when I stuck out my arm because I wanted to move into the left turn lane .
Thank you for not using your horn when it was not necessary .
Thank you for all the little ways that you cooperate .
That ’s the title of a recent piece by Paul Graham , who ’s often pointed - to here and who I think is one of our greatest living essayists , and since ongoing ’s full name is ongoing fragmented essay , that ’s a strong claim .
Inequality and Risk , and this is a compliment , is deeply wrong , but made me stop thinking about all the other things I was thinking for quite some time about because I had to think about it .
Herewith remarks on Inequality and Public Policy ; but first , go read Paul ’s essay .
He makes two big mistakes .
First , he postulates someone who “ wants to get rid of economic inequality ” , and argues against that position .
Second , his arguments go off the rails when he tries to transition from generalities to mathematics .
Ending Inequality ? ·
So who , exactly , wants to end inequality ?
Well , I used to , back when I was 18 years old and briefly an actual card - carrying Communist , until I found out they really meant that scary bullshit about supporting the Soviet Union and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat .
Old - line Marxists used to fantasize about the end - game : “ To each according to his needs , from each according to his ability ” .
Well , it ’s not like that because people are n’t like that , and while the Marxists had some pretty useful critiques of where capitalism can go awry , none of their ideas about What Comes Next turned out to be any good at all .
So , I do n’t know anyone who believes for a second that you could end inequality , or even that it ’s worth trying .
It ’s simpler than that ; we want to minimize poverty .
Ye have the poor always with you said Jesus ( Matt 26:11 ) but we can hope he was wrong .
It does n’t really need justification : poverty which need not exist is profoundly immoral and unaesthetic and suboptimal and should be corrected .
But if you want justification , here it is : some people seem to deserve their poverty , having brought it on themselves ; but their children do n’t .
Once you clear away this bullshit about wanting to end inequality , you can have a useful argument about reducing poverty .
I ’m enough of a realist to acknowledge that one of the best ways of doing that is to encourage a vibrant , free , open , unobstructed marketplace .
But I also think that progressive taxation is , in moderation , good macroeconomics and good policy .
Proportionality ·
And here ’s where Paul really goes off the rails .
Search forward for “ applies proportionately ” , and you encounter this astounding assertion :
Growth
This argument applies proportionately .
It ’s not just that if you eliminate economic inequality , you get no startups .
To the extent you reduce economic inequality , you decrease the number of startups . [ 4 ]
Increase taxes , and willingness to take risks decreases in proportion .
Oh , really ?
There ’s a smooth mathematical relationship extending off to infinity in both directions ?
That ’s what “ proportionately ” means , last math course I took .
Let ’s grant that economic inequality is a useful driver to creativity , hard work , and the creation of wealth that everyone gets to share in .
But let ’s not kid ourselves that this — or really much of anything in the social sciences — looks like a smooth O ( N ) curve .
Yeah , give people a chance to get ahead and they will .
But if they already have a Lexus and a 2 - story lodge in Aspen , will the chance at a Maybach and a 3 - story lodge really drive them to go through all the startup bullshit again ?
Well , yes , it will ; but only for those people who live for that startup adrenaline and for doing deals ; but those people would be doing it anyhow , because that ’s the kind of people they are .
Call me old - fashioned , but here in Vancouver the streets are stuffed ( on the pavement ) with Mercedes and BMWs and Porsches and , and on the sidewalk , there are street people begging for their bread , and kids dropping out of high school to take care of their siblings because their parents are n’t making it .
I want to help those people on the sidewalk , and if a bit more progressive taxation will help , that ’s OK by me .
What we do n’t need is pseudoquantitative assertions that can be used by the Dubyas of the world to justify slashing taxes on the the top 1 % , and then doing it again and again .
People are n’t that simple , which means that politics is n’t either .
[ Disclosure : I ’ve also tried pretty hard to get rich , and not done as well as Paul Graham , but OK . ]
A never - before - seen image of an astronomical alignment of a Uranian moon , Ariel , as it traverses the face of the giant gas planet .
The shadow cast by a moon as it drifted through space above the blue - green cloudtops of Uranus was recentlycaptured for the first time by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope .
To anobserver on Uranus , the passage of the planet 's icy moon Arielwould have appeared as a solar eclipseand the Sun would be completely blottedout .
However , the effect would not be nearly as dramatic as a total eclipseinvolving Earth and its moon .
The Sun appears much smaller on Uranus than onEarth because the giant planet is located much further away .
Therefore , a totaleclipse involving its moon completely blocks out not only the Sun 's body , butalso its corona .
Though such " transits " by moons across the disks of their planets are commonplacefor other gas giants like Jupiter , the satellites of Uranus orbit theplanet in such a way that they rarely cast shadows on the planet 's surface .
Themoons of Uranus orbit the planet above the equator , so their paths alignedge - on to the Sun only every 42 years .
In orderfor a Uranian transit to occur , the Sun must shinedirectly over the giant planet 's equator ; the next time this will happen againis in 2007 .
The last time such a Uranian equinoxoccurred was in 1965 , but telescopes at the time were not sharp enough to viewthe transits .
Named aftera mischievous airy spirit in Shakespeare 's " The Tempest , " Ariel isonly one - third the size of Earth 's moon .
The moon is the nearest large satellite to Uranus .
As Uranusapproaches equinox , there will be additional eclipses by its large moons Umbriel , Titania , Oberon , as wellas manysmaller moons .
Because ourmoon is moving slowly away , it is only at this moment in geologic history thata totaleclipse can happen on Earth .
Millions of years from now , our moon will be too small in the sky to completelyblock out the Sun .

Kris and I joined some friends last weekend for a 40th birthday celebration at Bluehour , a swanky Portland restaurant .
While the other couples spent $ 150 to $ 250 for their meals , we escaped paying only $ 52 , including tip .
We had n't planned to do this , but our unintentional parsimony taught us a few ways to save the next time we dine out at a fancy restaurant :
Eat a healthy snack before you go to take the edge off your hunger .
Kris often does this — I do not .
It enables her to look at a menu and order reasonably .
I , on the other hand , get carried away when I feel ravenous , and order too much .
Order something that takes time to eat .
Some foods — such as pasta — are easy to eat .
You can scarf them down quickly .
At Bluehour , we ordered a couple of fiddly things : a cheese fondue and a plate of cheeses , olives , and meats .
While everybody else was finished with dinner , we were still working on ours .
Eating slowly allows you to reach a feeling of fullness .
Order appetizers as your meal .
We 've begun to do this more often .
Last weekend 's fondue and cheese plate were considered appetizers , but they were delicious and filling .
The fondue for two with artisan bread and apples cost just $ 12 .
An alternative on the menu was six - bites - worth of bacon - wrapped scallops for $ 16 .
The scallops would definitely be an appetizer , while the fondue could actually serve as a meal .
Watch what you drink .
We each had one cocktail on Saturday .
They were expensive : $ 10 each .
( It was a very swanky place . )
Imagine how quickly our expenses would have increased if we'd had more than one drink .
Better yet , imagine how much we could have saved if we'd only had water .
Decide which you 'd enjoy more : a cocktail starter , a glass of wine with dinner , or perhaps dessert and coffee .
Choose one rather than splurging on all three .

Order in sequence .
If the restaurant will allow , order and eat your appetizer before you place your order for an entree .
If , as is usual , you order everything at the same time , it 's easy to order more food than you need .
Be patient if you try this technique , the kitchen will need time to prepare your entree once the order has been placed .
( Also consider increasing your tip if you order in sequence — you 're displacing the table for a longer period of time . )

Share food .
At Gino's , our favorite restaurant , the portions are enormous .
Splitting an entree gives us enough food for two .
Many restaurants charge an extra few bucks for doing this , but it 's much less than paying for a second unnecessary entree .
At Bluehour we were able to share our food without extra charge .

Take food home .
An excellent way to stretch your restaurant dollar is to actually plan to take home leftovers .
Kris and I have done this for years , yet I do n't know how wide - spread the practice is .
If you do this , keep it in mind when browsing the menu ; some foods keep and reheat much better than others .

Skip ( or share ) dessert .
I 've heard of people keeping a bar of dark chocolate ( or other sweet treat ) in their purse or car .
Often , you crave just a bite or two of something sweet — so satisfy that craving on your way home .
Or , if you can agree on a choice with your dinner companions , split a dessert .
Many of the same tips for saving money at a restaurant will also help to keep your calories in check .
Restaurant portions are huge .
There 's nothing worse than blowing both the budget and your waistline , only to be filled with regret later .
By making smart choices to split meals , skip courses and limit alcoholic or sugary beverages , you can relish the experience while keeping your frugal self - respect .
Assyrian MP disputes claims of western media on minorities rights in Iran
6/6/06
Tehran ( IRNA ) -- Representative of Assyrian and Chaldean minorities in Majlis Younaten Bet-Klia said that the propaganda of the West on violation of the minorities rights in Iran are illusive claims .
He told IRNA that the Western countries merely seek subjects for their own intellectual and human rights slogans .
Stressing that Iran does not need any patronage , he said that the West should rather seek a way to tackle the racist movements and catastrophes underway in the Western countries claiming to be proponents of human rights .
" Here in Iran , a representative of minorities in Majlis is authorized to impeach a minister and call on the president for clarification , " he added .
He said that according to Constitution 's Article 19 , all Iranian people from various ethnic groups enjoy equal rights .
Besides neither color of skin and race nor religion and language are considered as privilege .
The MP said that Iran is the only country where religious minorities coexist comfortably .
" The Constitution has authorized us to protect our own religion , language and culture , while the government has never interfered in the religious affairs and rituals of the minorities , " he added .
Bet -Klia called on the world pretenders to human rights to participate in religious ceremonies of the minorities while visiting Iran and see that they are free to observe their rituals .
" As a citizen of Iran , a country with a 3,000 - year - old civilization , I take pride in having so far coexisted peacefully with my countrymen in full freedom and with comfort , " he added .
Turning to the claims of Western media that according to a bill on dress code ratified by Iranian Majlis , the religious minorities are required to put badges on their clothes to distinguish them from Muslims , he said how a prime minister can refer to a bill about which we as members of Iranian parliament ( Majlis ) know nothing .
Following the release of a false report by the Canadian daily , National Post about such a bill , Canada 's Prime Minister Stephen Harper rushed to show a reaction without taking time to verify it .
Concerning the national dress code in Iran , he said , " Not only is it not problematic , but is rather rational and acceptable .
Besides , in most countries during national ceremonies the participants are required to put on their national dress . "
He stressed that even if there are any concerns in Iran , they are equally applicable to all Iranians irrespective of their religion .
Updated Pity if you will poor old Zinedine Zidane : sent off during the World Cup final for a serious infraction of FIFA 's " no headbutting Italians " rule and now reduced to the status of French national hero with enough cash in the bank to enjoy a lifetime of truffles , stuffed songbirds and fine vintage champagne .
Indeed , while the rest of the world was struggling to contain its outrage at Zidane 's unsportsmanlike use of the Glasgow handshake , Jacques Chirac counterattacked with : " I would like to express all the respect that I have for a man who represents at the same time all the most beautiful values of sport , the greatest human qualities one can imagine , and who has honoured French sport and , simply , France . "
Well , therein lies the rub , mon ami .
How you view the whole thing depends largely on your national perspective , as nicely demonstrated by a viral email we received this morning :
As seen by the Germans :
As seen by the French :
As seen by the Italians :
As seen by the Americans :
As seen by the press :
Terrific .
For the record , we at Vulture Central believe that - contrary to current wisdom - the Materazzi - felling incident was provoked not by references to Zidane 's mother and his Algerian ancestry , but rather the suggestion that Italian wine may be of equal , or superior , quality to its French equivalent .
In the circumstances , Zidane 's reaction as the embodiment of France was understandable .
Let 's face it , the Bastille was stormed for less . ®

2G iPod nano reviewed
We 've reviewed the brand - new second - generation iPod Nano .
Check it out !
If you 're interested in seeing how the original iPod nano performed in this review from 2005 , read on !
The original iPod nano
i Pod nano
Manufacturer : Apple ( product page )
System requirements : Macintosh computer running Mac OS X 10.3.4 or later , USB port ; Windows PC running Windows 2000 SP4 or Windows XP SP2 , USB port
Price : US $ 199 ( 2GB ) , US $ 249 ( shop for the iPod nano )
As we all know , Apple 's iPod has dominated the digital music player scene since its launch in 2001 , much like an aardvark busting through a termite mound .
As hard - drive - based players have gotten smaller and the price of flash - based players has dropped , Apple seized on the opportunity to dive into the flash - based market with the iPod shuffle .
It was a wildly successful move for Apple , which has grabbed close to 46 percent of the flash - based player market since its inception .
However , there were still many reasons for users not to get the shuffle — namely , the lack of a screen and sophisticated controls .
The task for Apple was to create a music player that was somehow a marriage between the minute size of the iPod shuffle and the versatility of a regular iPod .
Last Tuesday , Apple 's solution came in the form of the iPod nano , a mini-mini-version of their current iPod color line .
That 's right , it 's more miniature than the iPod mini , and the display is color !
It 's clear that these two superior elements are the reasons why Apple decided to do away with the original iPod mini line ; however many consumers are upset that the iPod nano 's storage capacity is smaller than what the iPod mini used to be .
At 2GB and 4GB , though , the capacities are higher than the current iPod shuffle line and the pricing falls right in line in between shuffles and regular color iPods .
A brief word about sound quality : the iPod nano uses the same audio codec ( the WM8975 ) as the 4G iPods .
The first and second generation iPods used the WM8721 , while the 3G iPods and iPod mini used the WM8731L .
Since the iPod nano uses the same audio codech chip as the 4G , U2 , and iPod photo players , its sound quality will be nearly identical to those other players .
Opening the package
The out - of - box experience was nothing less than expected from Apple : excessive , high - end , and oh - so - delightful .
When purchasing our 2GB black iPod nano for this review , it even came in a " commemorative " iPod nano bag .
Opening the slim nano box was pretty much the same as opening any other iPod , and the contents were laid out in a similar manner — simple , elegant , and organized .
It 's when you take the iPod nano out of the box that the true experience begins .
That thing is really , really nano !
Photos do n't even convey how small and light the iPod nano really is .
In fact at first , at 3.5 " x 1.6 " x 0.27 " and 1.5 ounces , it almost seemed too small and too light for me in my hand .
The thinness is marvelous from an aesthetic and engineering standpoint , but my first thought upon holding it was do n't break it .
We 'll get to exploring that thought later , though .
The iPod nano is so thin that it slips effortlessly into the coin pocket on a pair of women 's jeans , with room to spare .
It certainly makes the " thousand songs right in your pocket " example a reality , especially to women who have very little pocket space and are much more adverse to carrying bulkier electronics in those pockets than men .
The iPod nano barely shows a profile in the pocket and it's easy to forget about its presence after carrying it around for awhile .
The iPod nano comes with all of the standard accessories , including the standard white iPod headphones ( some people have poined out that providing black iPod nano with white headphones is a bit of a fashion faux pas , but I 'll leave that rant for a different time ) , a USB cable , and a dock adapter for use of your iPod nano with a standard iPod dock .
However , the nano 's dock adapter must be too complex for us two lowly engineers , because getting it to fit with either of our regular iPod docks was ( and still is ) truly perplexing .
After nearly thirty minutes of fiddling between the two of us , we finally gave up on the nano dock adapter altogether .
Worry not , however , as the iPod nano plugs just dandily into a regular dock without the adapter — it just sits straight up in the middle of the designated iPod area instead of being flush with plastic all the way around .
Update :
After publishing this review last night , we had several readers contact us with information concerning the so - called " Dock Adapter . "
Dan Frakes from Playlist Magazine provided us with the most information and it came straight from the marketing folks in attendance at the special event .
According to Dan , the " dock adapter " is meant to be to be used with future iPod accessories so that they will be able to connect to practically any new iPod .
In a utopian world , this would mean that your new iPod would instantly be compatible with any new accessory that offered support for the " universal dock adapter . "

· Mothers may get € 1,000 a month to have third child ·
High birthrate fails to stop population shrinking
Middle - class mothers in France could be paid up to € 1,000 ( £ 675 ) a month - almost the minimum wage - to stop work for a year and have a third child under a government scheme to boost the birthrate , already among the highest in Europe .
Despite female employment statistics that are the envy of the continent , the government remains worried about the reluctance of better - educated women to have babies .
A plan to be unveiled by the prime minister , Dominique de Villepin , today is expected to double an existing cash incentive for big families .
In a Europe facing serious demographic decline , France 's buoyant birthrate of 1.9 children a woman is well above the average of 1.4 and surpassed only by Ireland .
France can also boast one of the EU 's highest rates of female employment : 81 % of women between 25 and 49 are in work , including 75 % of those with two children ( and 51 % of those with more than two ) .
But a recent report by Hubert Brin , the head of the National Union of Family Associations , warned that even France 's high birthrate would not prevent the population shrinking .
One of the problems is that middle - class and professional women are postponing the age at which they start a family ( the 2004 average was 29.6 ) , and spacing out their pregnancies ( now nearly four years between the first and second child ) .
As a result , fewer women will have more than two children .
The government hopes to reverse the downtrend by raising an existing € 512 monthly grant , the allowance paid to mothers ( or , in theory but rarely in practice , fathers ) who put their jobs on hold to raise a second or third child .
The grant will be available only for a third baby , and limited to one year .
But it will be tied to the parent 's salary , with an expected ceiling of € 1,000 .
The French minimum wage is € 1,200 a month .
" The old deal only really attracted women in poorly paid work , not those with qualifications and competitive career jobs , " said Dominique Meda , a leading social policy specialist .
" This one could be that extra encouragement they need to take the plunge .
It may even encourage some fathers to take a year off . "
France 's family policy , launched in the 1970s , aims to improve the country 's birthrate and keep as many women in work as possible .
" The main point is that women here no longer stop working when they have children : the majority work , even those with three kids , " said Ms Meda .
The French state aims to make it easy for working women to have children - either by allowing them to take time off from their jobs without too much of a financial loss , or by providing cheap , high - quality childcare .
Maternity leave , on near full pay , ranges from 20 weeks for the first child to 40 or more for a third .
A whole gamut of grants , allowances and tax breaks is available , increasing substantially once a family has three children : all French " familles nombreuses " get some €300 in monthly allowances and travel as good as free on public transport .
At the same time , the network of state - run or state - approved creches - for children from two months old - has been expanded over the past decade or so , as has the number of state - registered childminders .
Depending on the family 's income , childcare costs from virtually nothing to around € 500 a month for the most well - off .
Nursery school from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm is free for every child from the age of three .
" We plainly have a very good system compared with many countries , " said Sylvie Clarke , 37 , a mother of three from Lille .
" It 's true that , in France , you can have babies without it being a major financial blow , and without worrying whether you 'll be able to go back to work afterwards . "
Ms Clarke , a bank executive , said she had been able to take up to a year off work for each of her three children because of the generous maternity leave offered by her employer , and so had never considered taking extended parental leave .
" It did n't appeal to people earning much more than the minimum wage , " she said .
" So it 's plain that by raising the ceiling they 'll interest a whole new group .
But I 'm not sure that women in really highly competitive jobs , where presence is everything , will be tempted .
And at the end of the day , it 's not more money - or rather less of a financial penalty - that makes you want a third child .
It 's the idea of having a third child . "

Why Web 2.0 Is So Seriously Embarrassing
I 'm still trying to figure out what the hell " Web 2.0 " means .
Of course , the first problem is that it does n't mean anything , or worse , it means anything anyone who wants to hype themselves or their wares wants it to mean .
I guess " Web 2.0 " is some catch phrase created to help not - terribly - with - it VC's and burned out dot - commers identify new business ventures that have all the appeal of loser businesses like pets.com , right ?
" Web 2.0 : Where A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted ! "
Or was that partied ?
It 's a sticker you can stick on the bumper of some new lame ass business that has all hype and no substance going for it .
Just like the show , Pimp My Ride , you take a broken down 1995 business concept , paint it up with a few airbrushed RSS stickers , and voila , you got the hottest new hot rod in town .
My dad was an Madison Avenue Ad man .
He said he wished he had a typewriter that only had 4 or 5 keys .
They would n't have QWERTY letters on them , but instead would feature the standard ad man hype lexicon .
His typewriter would have " NEW " and " IMPROVED " and " SMOOTHER " and " CREAMIER " keys .
And now I can add " WEB 2.0 ENHANCED " to his imaginary typewriter .
Yes , he called it what it was -- his hypewriter .
Yes , I 'm beginning to worry that " WEB 2.0 " is the Viagra of the current business boom .
Big talk from old guys at late night business conference cocktail parties , but nothing worth bragging about in the morning .
Author Stan Goff , a retired 26 - year veteran of the U.S. Army Special Forces , sounds a warning call that many of the historical precursors of fascism — white supremacy , militarization of culture , vigilantism , masculine fear of female power , xenophobia and economic destabilization — are ascendant in America today .
When I was 18 , before student tracking in the public schools had been formalized , an informal tracking system was nevertheless in place : the university track , the craft track , the poultry worker track , and the prison track .
I was somewhere between the last two .
Both my parents were working in a defense contractor factory , and I was left adrift in the factory - worker ‘ burbs to be trained by television and alcohol .
Raised on a curriculum of McCarthyism , I did the most logical thing I could think of to avoid both the factory and eventual incarceration with the ne’er - do - wells with whom I was keeping company .
I joined the Army , and volunteered to fight communists in Vietnam .
I tried to get out of the Army once , and it lasted for four years , whereupon I ended up doing piecework in a sweatshop outside Wilmar , Ark .
Back on that public school track , I suppose , but given that the U.S. was no longer invading anyone ’s country , and that I was responsible for an infant now , I went back into the Army .
One thing led to another , and as it turned out I was good at something called special operations , and I ended up making a career of it .
By the time I signed out on terminal leave in December 1995 , I had worked in eight places designated “ armed conflict areas , ” where people who were brown and poor seemed to be the principle targets of these “ special ” operations .
At some point toward the end , I had decided that plenty of people could look back and say they wished they ’d lived differently ; and I was just one of them ; and that I might salvage something worthwhile from the whole experience by telling the people who had paid me — people who pay taxes — what their money was really being spent to do .
Among other activities , I started writing books .
The Bad Apple
There was nothing more inflammatory in my first book , about the 1994 invasion and occupation of Haiti , than my assertion that Special Operations was a hotbed of racism and reaction .
“ Hideous Dream – A Soldier ’s Memoir of the US Invasion of Haiti ” ( Soft Skull Press , 2000 ) was my personal account of that operation , and I was explicit not only about the significant number of white supremacists in Special Operations but how the attitudes of these extremists connected with the less explicit white male supremacy of white patriarchal American society and defined , in some respects , the attitude taken by U.S. occupation forces in Haiti toward the Haitian population .
The resistance to this allegation was particularly fierce , and not merely from those inside the Special Operations “ community , ” whose outrage was more public - relations stagecraft than anything else .
There was outrage from people who had n’t a moment of actual experience in the military at all .
This is an affront to something sacred in the public imaginary of a thoroughly militarized United States : that we are an international beacon of civilized virtue , and that our military is the masculine epitome of that virtue standing between our suburban security and the dark chaos of the Outside .
Questioning the mystique of the armed forces is tantamount to lunacy at best and treason at worst .
This is the reason bad - apple-ism has been the predominant meme of the media and the Pentagon when they are compelled to discuss the stories of torture , rape and murder in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ A few bad apples ” committed torture .
“ A few bad apples ” raped prisoners , fellow female soldiers , and civilians in their homes .
The massacre was not descriptive of the Marine Corps , but the work of “ a few bad apples . ”
Anyone who wants to be the skunk at this prevarication party need only ask , “ How do these bad apples all seem to aggregate into the same units ? ”
One bad apple was dispensed with on June 11 , 2001 .
That ’s when Timothy McVeigh was given a lethal injection at 7 a.m. in the death chamber of the U.S. federal penitentiary at Terre Haute , Ind .
Frugivorous analogies aside , McVeigh was not the product of a tree or poor storage , but of a culture .
Raised in western New York by a devoutly Catholic father — an autoworker — after his parents divorced when he was 10 , Tim McVeigh , like many other white youths who are socially awkward and living in times of economic insecurity , was already reading survivalist and white nationalist literature in his teens .
The mythic - patriarchal absolutism of racial ideology mapped perfectly onto the consciousness of someone raised by a religiously devout male , and the fact that this ideology responded directly to the insecurities of economic and gender destabilization secured McVeigh as an early devotee .
Gore Vidal said that McVeigh “ needed a self - consuming cause to define him [ self ] . ”
Vidal ’s account , “ The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh , ” ominously printed in Vanity Fair just days before the 9/11 attacks expressed another “ self - consuming cause , ” noted that McVeigh took his cues from the very government he had worked for as a soldier .
Before McVeigh ’s attack in Oklahoma City , the most recent attack by Americans against Americans outside of warfare was the FBI - BATF massacre of an obscure religious commune that was demonized for destruction at Waco , Texas — which McVeigh memorialized by blowing up the Murrah Building on the Waco massacre ’s second anniversary .
When McVeigh was interviewed about the “ collateral damage ” in Oklahoma , he was asked if he felt remorse .
He replied that Truman had never apologized for Hiroshima or Nagasaki .
And the formative moment in Iraq for Tim McVeigh was the order by Major General Barry McCaffrey — the sociopath appointed by Bill Clinton to be the nation ’s “ drug czar ” — to slaughter a seven - mile line of retreating Iraqi soldiers and civilians after the cease - fire in Iraq … now called the Turkey Shoot .
As the old military motto says , “ Trained by the best , kill like the rest . ”
Much has been made of McVeigh ’s affinity for “ The Turner Diaries , ” a neo -Nazi novel about a white nationalist guerrilla war in the U.S. , written under pseudonym by the late William Pierce .
Less often noted was another formative cultural product for McVey , “ Red Dawn , ” a silly film about American teenagers organizing an armed resistance to the Soviet occupation of the United States .
While “ silly ” is a descriptive term for both these cultural products , we cannot assume they are irrelevant .
Dr. Peikoff applies Ayn Rand 's revolutionary philosophy to real - world questions .
At the age of 17 , Leonard Peikoff was invited to the home of Ayn Rand , the novelist and Objectivist philosopher .
Thus began a friendship that lasted until her death in 1982 .
Today , Dr. Peikoff is Rand 's legal and intellectual heir - and the world 's foremost authority on Objectivism .
An author for our times
Renowned philosopher , Dr. Peikoff is the author of Objectivism : The Philosophy of Ayn Rand and The Ominous Parallels : The End of Freedom in America .
He has edited numerous Ayn Rand anthologies and has recently published a new book , The DIM Hypothesis , which deals with the role of epistemology in cultural and practical affairs .
A splinter faction of Flickr photo - sharing community members is threatening a symbolic " mass suicide " to protest closer integration with the website 's new owner , Yahoo .
The portal giant bought Flickr 's developer , Ludicorp , for an undisclosed sum in March and took ownership of the site when it moved from Vancouver , Canada , to Yahoo's Sunnyvale , California , campus this summer .
Now , angered by a new requirement to tie their member profiles with Yahoo accounts , some Flickrites say they plan to kill off their identities before they can be moved into the new family next year .
" If Flickr really forces me to join Yahoo in 2006 in order to still use my account , I will quit 24 hours before the deadline , " wrote Thomas Müller , a Hamburg , Germany - based artist who shows more than 1,400 photos at the site .
On Wednesday , Müller created a protest group , Flick Off , that has attracted almost 400 members .
At stake is a new user - profile stipulation that reads : " We will be migrating all independent Flickr accounts to Yahoo 's network in 2006 .
At that time , if you have not done so already , you will be asked to create a Yahoo ID ( or link your account to your Yahoo ID if you already have one ) in order to continue using your account . "
Members ' photos will be deleted if they later drop their account with the portal and search engine , disappointing some .
" This comes after many of us have invested so much time and effort ; it makes it a chore to do anything except bend over , grab our ankles and smile , " said Dana Smith , a San Francisco - based Flick
Off supporter whose photographs rank among Flickr 's most interesting material .
" If Flickr was honestly concerned about anything besides bank account size , then there would be zero point or purpose to force us into an account we did not originally agree to , " Smith said .
Launched in 2002 , Flickr has grown along with digital camera sales and has helped popularize tagging .
Named " Breakout of the Year " at the 2005 Webby Awards , the community now numbers 37 million photos and 1.2 million members , many of whom are considered to be among the web 's most creative image makers .
The concern comes as the site , celebrated for its close - knit and cozy air , joins the large Yahoo network .
The portal ruffled feathers back in 1999 when it bought up web homestead community GeoCities and claimed the copyright on all members ' pages .
Stewart Butterfield , who co-founded Flickr with wife Caterina Fake , moved to soothe fears .
He said users and the new owners were " all on the same side , " just that the team " could have done a much better job in communicating what all this meant . "
" ( Members ' )
Flickr identity can be as distinct as they want it to be in terms of how other users see them – it just means that they sign on using different credentials , " Butterfield told Wired News .
" The integration will make it a lot easier to most new users , since so many people already have Yahoo IDs , and there will be lots of benefits for everyone .
It does n't make sense to run both systems in parallel forever . "
Butterfield , who posts with users in Flickr forums , explained that site members would not have to represent themselves using their Yahoo screen names , which would just be for signing on .
Small in context , the opposition to the change illustrates the attachment many feel toward their online identities , according to professor Sherry Turkle , director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Initiative on Technology and Self and author of Life on the Screen : Identity in the Age of the Internet .
" So many of us do n't have a gathering place that feels comfortable and communal , " she said .
" For those who found that on Flickr.com , its transformation into a ' service ' on Yahoo is a loss ; they are losing something important to them .
" It is a harbinger of the greater sensitivity we need to show in the future as we take more seriously the psychological importance of our digital lives . "
REASON | February 2000
[ Review of Michael Warner 's The Trouble with Normal ]
LATELY
I have begun to understand how a Methodist must feel when everyone he meets calls him a Lutheran .
People often describe me as a libertarian .
All right , it 's true that I often write in a skeptical vein about government .
Yes , I have come to see a higher , Zen - like power in leaving things alone .
I generally do subscribe to H.L. Mencken 's dictum , " All persons who devote themselves to forcing virtue on their fellow men deserve nothing better than kicks in the pants . "
But still .
I know , in the visceral and insistent way the Methodist knows he is not a Lutheran , that my worldview is not quite congruent with what most people today regard as libertarianism .
It is hard to evade one label , however , when you can't offer another .
If not " libertarian , " then what ?
For a while , I tried " curmudgeon . "
A curmudgeon , in my own enlightened sense , is a person who is against improving things for the sake of it .
( These days , " curmudgeon " is not the same as " conservative , " because , ever since Barry Goldwater , many American conservatives have been radical reformers . )
I tried " radical incrementalist . "
A radical incrementalist is a person who seeks to foment revolutionary change on a geological time scale .
The trouble is that " curmudgeon " and " radical incrementalist " both describe my temperament but say nothing of my beliefs .
So I gave up .
And then , a little while ago , I figured it out .
I am , I discovered , a soft communitarian .
A what ?
You roll your eyes , and I can't blame you .
Bear with me , however .
There is a fair amount of undesignated soft communitarianism about these days , and it signifies the emergence of an important sort of thinking .
A soft communitarian is a person who maintains a deep respect for what I call " hidden law " : the norms , conventions , implicit bargains , and folk wisdoms that organize social expectations , regulate everyday behavior , and manage interpersonal conflicts .
Until recently , for example , hidden law regulated assisted suicide , and it did so with an almost miraculous finesse .
Doctors helped people to die , and they often did so without the express consent of anybody .
The decision was made by patients and doctors and families in an irregular fashion , and , crucially , everyone pretended that no decision had ever been made .
No one had been murdered ; no one had committed suicide ; and so no one faced prosecution or perdition .
Hidden law is exceptionally resilient , until it is dragged into politics and pummeled by legalistic reformers , at which point it can give way all at once .
The showboating narcissist Jack Kevorkian dragged assisted suicide into the open and insisted that it be legalized ( and televised ) .
At that point , the deal was off .
No one could pretend assisted suicide was n't happening .
Activists framed state right - to - die initiatives , senators sponsored bills banning assisted suicide , and courts began issuing an unending series of deeply confused rulings .
Soon decisions about assisted suicide will be made by buzzing mobs of lawyers and courts and ethics committees , with prosecutors helpfully hovering nearby , rather than by patients and doctors and families .
And the final indignity will be that the lawyers and courts and committee people will congratulate themselves on having at last created a rational process where before there were no rules at all , only chaos and darkness and barbarism .
And then , having replaced an effective and intuitive and flexible social mechanism with a maladroit and mystifying and brittle one , they will march on like Sherman 's army to demolish such other institutions of hidden law as they encounter .
THE enemy of hidden law is not government , as such .
It is lawyers .
Three years in law school teach , if they teach nothing else , that as a practical matter hidden law does not exist , or that if it does exist it is contemptibly inadequate to cope with modern conflicts .
The American law school is probably the most ruthlessly anti-communitarian institution that any liberal society has ever produced .
For eons , hidden law has coped sublimely with adultery .
As long as the adulterer was discreet and the wife either did n't know what was going on or was willing to pretend she did n't know , everybody else also pretended not to know .
Public law 's rather different way of handling the situation was on display in the Clinton - Jones - Starr - Lewinsky affair , and it was not superior .
So , also , for sexual conduct involving adults in the workplace .
Hidden law was imperfect for situations where flirting got out of hand , but today 's sexual harassment law , in which platoons of lawyers scour office e-mails for hints of unwelcome overtures , is proving itself not just imperfect but grotesque .
What about the " soft " part ?
Why a " soft " communitarian ?
Because there is a harder variety that replicates the lawyers ' mistakes in a communitarian direction .
The hard communitarian , seeing that hidden law has broken down , demands a series of public laws or subsidies to re-establish it .
Require children to support their aging parents , require students to do involuntary volunteer work , make voting mandatory -- that sort of thing .
The archetype of the hard communitarian is Lee Kwan Yew , the former prime minister of Singapore .
In America , an example might be Rudolph Giuliani , the mayor of New York City .
We softies , by contrast , understand that hidden law works precisely because it is not formal :
The very act of formalizing it destroys it .
We believe , therefore , that public law 's next big project should be to sit down and shut up .
That is , public law should be careful , infinitely more careful than at present , not to burst into every room it sees and immediately begin breaking crockery .
It should strive to stay out of hidden law 's way , rather than obliviously trampling it with each elephantine footfall .
When personal behavior needs regulating , we soft communitarians prefer exhortation to legislation and shame to jail .
A good , albeit controversial , example of an effective soft - communitarian activist is Bill Bennett , with his Book of Virtues , his " index of leading cultural indicators , " and his denunciations of gangsta rap .
Bennett says he opposes legal regulation of song lyrics , but he certainly does not oppose confronting recording company executives and demanding that they read aloud some of the lyrics they sell .
He practices censoriousness rather than censorship .
That is " soft " in a nutshell .
We soft communitarians are soft in a further sense : Like F.A. Hayek ( who in some ways was a soft communitarian ) , we do not believe in taking an uncritical attitude toward social norms , even deeply embedded ones .
With all due respect to folk wisdom , I favor gay marriage , even though nothing could be less traditional .
Now that we know that homosexuals exist -- that they are not just neurotic heterosexuals who need a few jolts of electroshock -- the extension of the nuptial contract to them is not a sundering of tradition but an extension of it .
Thoughtful criticism allows us to see this .
Soft communitarianism is not blind obeisance to tradition .
It aspires to be rigorous rather than rigid .
An interesting question about soft communitarianism is : So what ?
Who could be against such a mushy and innocuous doctrine ?
Or who , anyway , apart from everyone who ever went to law school ?
You might point out that soft communitarians can be found toward the drab center of both political parties , where everyone is for " values " and " civil society . "
You might also note that soft communitarianism is perfectly consonant with most major strands of libertarianism .
The reason I am often mistaken for a libertarian -- even though I am more comfortable talking about rules than rights , I prefer reasonableness to reason , and I care about government 's effectiveness rather than its size -- is that my soft communitarianism leads toward a persistent skepticism about the oozing encroachment of public law into every pore of daily life .
Maybe the soft communitarian and the libertarian , like the Methodist and the Lutheran , are just two versions of basically the same thing .
But not so fast .
The fact is , many libertarians I know react with discomfort , often bordering on hysteria , to soft - communitarian talk .
They feel that if their life is not the law 's business , then it also is nobody else 's business .
They are deeply uneasy with social instruments like shame or opprobrium , which smack of big - nosed authoritarianism in a new guise .
And here a certain sort of libertarianism comes full circle to join hands with a certain sort of leftism .
The libertarians and the leftists come to blows over economic issues -- who should run the health care sector , for instance -- but they glare in hostile unison at the soft - communitarian project ( which , remember , also enlists some libertarian types of its own ; this gets complicated ) .
Underlying their hostility is an implicit theory of coercion that is worth grappling with , because it lies at the heart of today 's culture wars .
In that connection , consider Michael Warner .
WARNER is , to begin with , an English professor at Rutgers University .
But he is probably better known as a leading queer studies scholar .
And , more than that , he is an activist , closely associated with an extremely controversial group called Sex Panic ! , which organized in the mid-1990s to oppose what it regarded as the squelching of sexual freedom by gay and straight conservatives alike .
I ought to say , not that it matters , that I am discussed in passing in Warner 's new book , The Trouble with Normal : Sex , Politics , and the Ethics of Queer Life ( The Free Press ) .
Warner quotes me on gay marriage and says I am " more honest than most " of his ideological adversaries : a compliment I can return in kind .
Because The Trouble With Normal is , in large measure , an answer to Andrew Sullivan and other gay conservative advocates of homosexual marriage and assimilation , and because it concerns itself with various intramural disputes in the gay world ( strategies for AIDS prevention and the like ) , booksellers will confine it to the " gay interest " shelves .
That is a pity .
Warner is that rarest of writers , an honest extremist who is smart enough to see through to most ( though not all ) of the depths of his own positions and who is fiery enough not to flinch .
His agreeably written and commendably concise book thus turns out to be , among other things , a 200 - proof distillation of the case against soft communitarianism .
For example , Warner is shrewd enough to see that the standard defense of gay marriage by gay activists is wrong .
This defense holds out marriage as just one more lifestyle option .
It is available to heterosexuals , so it should be available to homosexuals as well , and that 's all there is to it .
But this is wrong .
Marriage , as Warner aptly puts it , is " a social system of both permission and restriction . "
Spouses and society alike view matrimony as something special and exalted ; it is not merely allowed , it is encouraged .
Far beyond merely creating legal arrangements , it is freighted with the social expectations and implicit requirements of hidden law .
It is a bargain not just between two people but between the couple and society :
The spouses agree to care for one another so that society does not need to , and society agrees in exchange to view their commitment to each other as inviolable and sovereign and , indeed , sacred .
Traditionalist conservatives understand that marriage confers special status under hidden law , which is why they so fiercely oppose extending it to homosexuals .
I understand that marriage confers special status , which is why I favor extending it to homosexuals .
And Warner , piping up from the radical left , also understands marriage 's special status , which is why he opposes gay marriage .
When marriage is available to gay people , he understands , gay people will be expected to marry , and married homosexuals will conduct themselves with the same ( let 's face it ) smugness that characterizes married heterosexuals .
" The effect , " Warner says , " would be to reinforce the material privileges and cultural normativity of marriage . "
Homosexuals who do not marry will be regarded as less respectable or less successful than those who do .
In Warner 's view , that would be a profound miscarriage of social justice .
For Warner is against not just the sexual norms of the moment but the very notion of sexual norms .
That is not to say he would decline to pass harsh judgment on a rapist .
But where consensual sex is concerned , he insists , society should just butt out .
Not only should the law stay out of the bedroom ( a standard libertarian position ) , so should norms , because all norms create " hierarchies of respectability . "
Warner opposes sexual norms for two reasons .
The first is that he is a radical egalitarian .
He believes in the moral virtue of diminishing differences -- moral , economic , or political - - between people and groups .
There is no arguing with a radical egalitarian on that point , so I wo n't .
The second reason goes a little deeper .
Warner makes a move which ordinary classical liberalism rejects out of hand but which has an undeniable kind of deep sense to it .
In standard liberal theory , coercion and force involve violence or the threat of violence : " Your money or your life . "
Because , in modern democracies , the state possesses a monopoly on legitimized violence , a coercive policy will be , by definition , a state policy .
Nothing that private people or institutions do by way of criticism or exclusion is coercive .
To Warner and others of his school , that view of coercion is laughably narrow and naive .
Norms use the clubs of stigma and shame to punish deviants , nonconformists , and radicals .
Many people would much rather be jailed than humiliated or ostracized , which is one reason American prisons are so crowded .
In a psychological sense , the denial of respectability can be just as coercive as the denial of physical freedom .
Nowhere in his book does Warner argue the theoretical case for his extended notion of coercion , but it is apparent on every page .
He regards moralizing as a kind of mandating , speaks of " the effect of coercion in the politics of shame , " and refers to the " deep coerciveness " of the sort of thinking that privileges marriage .
In his world , all social norms are more or less coercive , which means that all of them are oppressive when applied to consenting adults ' sexual or social lives .
WHATEVER its theoretical shortcomings , this sort of thinking exerts a broad attraction in today 's America .
Lots of people view Gary Bauer 's or Jerry Falwell 's strident condemnations of the " homosexual lifestyle " as being every bit as oppressive and intrusive as , say , sodomy laws .
For that matter , lots of people believe that moral criticism causes violence by fostering hate , or that moral criticism actually is violence ( " words that wound " ) .
Many people in America - - a majority , maybe -- feel queasy talking about " virtue " and " vice , " because that sort of talk implies judgmentalism , which implies a " hierarchy of respectability . "
People prefer sanitized expressions like " values . "
I would be curious to see what would happen if you visited a randomly selected college campus and asked the students whether it is right to judge other people 's lifestyles .
My guess is that most students would be appalled at the notion .
What is useful about Warner is that , being both bright and radical , he has no use for the mushy middle , where most ordinary people are content to leave such ideas .
He understands the implications of his view of coercion and does not shrink from embracing them .
The sort of nightmare society that a Falwell or a Bauer dreams up in order to scare donations out of church ladies is precisely the sort of society Warner wants to create .
To be sexually free , we need to be able to explore all possible sexual avenues with an open mind , and thus without fear of shame or stigma .
Keeping certain sexual behaviors hush - hush means that most people never think about trying them , which amounts to " constraint through ignorance . "
There should be no more closets of any sort .
Rather , says Warner , let " all the gerbils scamper free . "
And so , in the end , it is not gay marriage Warner opposes :
It is marriage , and all the conventional notions of shame and responsibility that go with marriage .
He does not actually demand that marriage be abolished , because , being a pragmatist , he would rather undermine it by extending all its benefits to unmarried partners -- in fact , to everybody .
He is likewise not foolish enough to imagine that sexual norms could be eliminated anytime soon , but he believes that the proper role of socially enlightened activism is to favor de-norming at every turn .
Although Warner 's view is extreme , it is more influential than you might suppose .
All three of the states and all but a handful of the municipalities that offer domestic partner programs for their workers include opposite - sex couples , who , of course , could perfectly well get married if they wanted the benefits of marriage .
The large majority of corporate partnership programs also allow heterosexuals to participate .
Who is to say , after all , that marriage is better than some other arrangement ?
Only recently , and with great effort , was the national welfare debate retrieved from the hands of nonjudgmentalists who argued that government 's job was to help the indigent , not to judge them .
I am not a soft communitarian because I think shame and stigma are sweet and lovely things .
They are not .
A weakness of the soft - communitarian position is its unwillingness to admit the truth in much of what Warner says .
In some respects , norms are oppressive and shaming is coercive .
Having admitted this , however , one can go on to see what Warner , and other anti-communitarians , do not : that soft communitarianism is less oppressive , usually much less so , than the real - world alternatives .
Shame and hypocrisy are not ideal ways to deal with philanderers and small - time mashers , but they are better than Paula Jones ' litigators and Kenneth Starr 's prosecutors .
Shame is valuable not because it is pleasant or fair or good but because it is the least onerous of all means of social regulation , and because social regulation is inevitable .
The implication of Warner 's view is that the only just society is one without any sexual norms regulating the conduct of consenting adults .
But , of course , a normless society is as inconceivable , literally , as a beliefless individual .
What would a culture without shame or guilt or " hierarchies of respectability " look like ?
How is a shameless society even imaginable , given the unbudgeable fact that humans , like dogs and chimpanzees , look to each other for guidance and approval and clues on how to behave ?
THE fact is , there are going to be norms ; the question is always , What sort of norms ?
In Warner 's world , the norm would be one of extreme social permissiveness .
People who expressed anything but approval of sexual adventurism would be stigmatized : shamed for engaging in the oppressive act of shaming .
If you do n't think this can happen , ask any student or professor who has been on the receiving end of a P.C. vilification campaign .
It is also a fact , I think , that shame is a core constituent of a social animal 's temperament .
Human beings crave the admiration of other human beings more than they crave anything else -- even , in many cases , life .
Warner seems to view shaming as a political sanction that , with enough effort , we can teach ourselves not to use .
But not to shame or be ashamed is like not loving , not laughing , not eating or talking .
So the Warnerian project is to repeal not just shame but humanity .
In that sense , Warner 's utopia is like the Marxist utopia , which repealed greed .
My guess is that Warner 's normless sexual utopia would be about as successful , and about as good for the downtrodden and marginalized , as Marx 's classless economic utopia turned out to be .
Oddly , the words " child " and " children " scarcely ever appear in Warner 's book .
This is an astonishing blind spot in a work of social criticism .
Being a defender of gay marriage , I 'm as tired as the next fellow of people who use children as a cover for all sorts of authoritarian arguments .
Still , Warner seems to find the very concept of parenting unfathomable .
The thought that sexual adventurers might be expected to keep certain of their activities out of the sight of 10 - year - old boys and girls , in exchange for being left alone , does not seem to have occurred to him .
( " No , darling , that 's not a game .
Those two people are doing what we call `fistfucking . ' " )
If you believe , as seems plausible , that there is a genuine clash of interests between parents and sexual adventurers , then the old dictates of hidden law - -" keep it out of sight , " for instance -- seem to be a pretty ingenious way to strike a balance .
Some especially conservative parents are indignant because sexual adventuring is too visible , while some especially radical adventurers are indignant because they are not allowed to copulate in front of City Hall .
Everyone else wishes the conservatives and the radicals would stop pushing the envelope before the bargain collapses altogether , leaving nothing but cops and politicians and lawyers to tell us how to behave .
In the end , the man who wants to replace norms with nothing is the best friend of the man who wants to replace norms with laws .
Dr. Kevorkian no doubt thinks of himself as a great champion of the right to die .
In fact , as is obvious to everybody but himself , he is a godsend to opponents of assisted suicide .
Michael Warner is the Jack Kevorkian of sexual liberty .
THE good news is that Warner will fail in his mission of de-norming the world .
He will be unable to persuade American homosexuals to rise up and rebel against hidden law and its Main Street codes of behavior .
The tide is running against him , and he knows it .
Perhaps the most heartening aspect of Warner 's book is its rage and despair over what Warner regards indignantly as the taming of homosexual politics and culture , the growing ascendancy of " gay " over " queer . "
Homosexuals are moving toward embracing the contract with hidden law .
They want to follow the rules and be respectable , and the heterosexual majority seems more and more inclined to let them .
The further good news is that gradually , quietly , Americans are becoming aware of the existence of hidden law .
Slowly - - OK , sometimes very slowly , and with the legal establishment still winning more battles than it loses -- Americans are beginning to rediscover the lost continent of convention that lies between law and libertinism , between banning and condoning .
They are , I like to hope , beginning to see that the hidden constitution , with its elaborate rules of etiquette and its byzantine architecture of pretense and its elaborate hierarchies of respectability , is much like the written constitution :
It restricts us so we can be free .

This is a " Death Car " mobile execution unit .
China is now executing criminals in these units .
VAN SPECS VAN SPECS Cost : $ 37,500 to $ 75,000 , depending on vehicle 's size
Length : 20 to 26 feet
Top speed : 65 to 80 mph THREE SECTIONS
Execution chamber : in the back , with blacked - out windows ; seats beside the stretcher for a court doctor and guards ; sterilizer for injection equipment ; wash basin
Observation area : in the middle , with a glass window separating it from execution area ; can accommodate six people ; official - in - charge oversees the execution through monitors connected to the prisoner and gives instruction via walkie - talkie .
Driver area Production to date : at least 40 vehicles , made by Jinguan and two other companies in Jiangsu and Shandong provinces China makes ultimate punishment mobile CHONGQING , China  Zhang Shiqiang , known as the Nine - Fingered Devil , first tasted justice at 13 .
His father caught him stealing and cut off one of Zhang 's fingers .
Twenty - five years later , in 2004 , Zhang met retribution once more , after his conviction for double murder and rape .
He was one of the first people put to death in China 's new fleet of mobile execution chambers .
The country that executed more than four times as many convicts as the rest of the world combined last year is slowly phasing out public executions by firing squad in favor of lethal injections .
Unlike the United States and Singapore , the only two other countries where death is administered by injection , China metes out capital punishment from specially equipped " death vans " that shuttle from town to town .
Makers of the death vans say the vehicles and injections are a civilized alternative to the firing squad , ending the life of the condemned more quickly , clinically and safely .
The switch from gunshots to injections is a sign that China " promotes human rights now , " says Kang Zhongwen , who designed the Jinguan Automobile death van in which " Devil " Zhang took his final ride .
State secret
For years , foreign human rights groups have accused China of arbitrary executions and cruelty in its use of capital punishment .
The exact number of convicts put to death is a state secret .
Amnesty International estimates there were at least 1,770 executions in China in 2005 — vs. 60 in the United States , but the group says on its website that the toll could be as high as 8,000 prisoners .
The " majority are still by gunshot , " says Liu Renwen , death penalty researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , a think tank in Beijing .
" But the use of injections has grown in recent years , and may have reached 40 % . "
China 's critics contend that the transition from firing squads to injections in death vans facilitates an illegal trade in prisoners ' organs .
Injections leave the whole body intact and require participation of doctors .
Organs can " be extracted in a speedier and more effective way than if the prisoner is shot , " says Mark Allison , East Asia researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong .
" We have gathered strong evidence suggesting the involvement of ( Chinese ) police , courts and hospitals in the organ trade . "
Executions in death vans are recorded on video and audio that is played live to local law enforcement authorities — a measure intended to ensure they are carried out legally .
China 's refusal to give outsiders access to the bodies of executed prisoners has added to suspicions about what happens afterward : Corpses are typically driven to a crematorium and burned before relatives or independent witnesses can view them .
Chinese authorities are sensitive to allegations that they are complicit in the organ trade .
In March , the Ministry of Health issued regulations explicitly banning the sale of organs and tightening approval standards for transplants .
Even so , Amnesty International said in a report in April that huge profits from the sale of prisoners ' organs might be part of why China refuses to consider doing away with the death penalty .
" Given the high commercial value of organs , it is doubtful the new regulations will have an effect , " Allison says .
Local executions
Makers of death vans say they save money for poor localities that would otherwise have to pay to construct execution facilities in prisons or court buildings .
The vans ensure that prisoners sentenced to death can be executed locally , closer to communities where they broke the law .
That " deters others from committing crime and has more impact " than executions carried out elsewhere , Kang says .
Jinguan — " Golden Champion " in Chinese — lies an hour 's drive from Chongqing in southwestern China , below the green slopes of Cliff Mountain .
Along with the death vans , the company also makes bulletproof limousines for the country 's rich and armored trucks for banks .
Jinguan 's glossy death van brochure is printed in both Chinese and English .
From the outside , the vans resemble the police vehicles seen daily on China 's roads .
A look inside reveals their function .
" I 'm most proud of the bed .
It 's very humane , like an ambulance , " Kang says .
He points to the power - driven metal stretcher that glides out at an incline .
" It 's too brutal to haul a person aboard , " he says .
" This makes it convenient for the criminal and the guards . "
The lethal cocktail used in the injections is mixed only in Beijing , something that has prompted complaints from local courts .
" Some places can't afford the cost of sending a person to Beijing — perhaps $ 250 — plus $ 125 more for the drug , " says Qiu Xingsheng , a former judge working as a lawyer in Chongqing .
Death - by - gunshot requires " very little expense , " he says .
Qiu has attended executions by firing squad where the kneeling prisoner is shot in the back of the head .
The guards " ask the prisoner to open his mouth , so the bullet can pass out of the mouth and leave the face intact , " he says .
No debate
In the United States , some death row inmates and death penalty opponents want the Supreme Court to declare lethal injections cruel and unusual .
A recent lawsuit claimed inmates suffer excruciating pain during executions because they do not get enough anesthetic .
There is no such debate in China , which uses the same three - drug cocktail as the U.S. federal government and most U.S. states : sodium thiopental to make the condemned unconscious , pancuronium bromide to stop breathing , potassium chloride to stop the heart .
People 's Daily and other state media describe the mix as a " non-virulent drug , " bringing about " immediate clinical death while inflicting no physiological pain . "
" It does n't matter what method you use , " Qiu says .
" If someone is convicted of a capital crime , they should be executed . "
Chinese prisoners condemned to death are not offered a choice of injection over gunshot , but Qiu and others suspect wealth and connections can buy the newer method .
" It is a real phenomenon that gangsters and corrupt officials are killed by injection more than gunshot , so their bodies are intact , and death is less painful , " Liu says .
" But I doubt it is government policy .
These criminals are usually held in cities , where the injection is used .
Common criminals are held in county - level facilities , where shooting is more common . "
Tycoon Yuan Baojing was executed in March in a death van , in northeast China 's Liaoyang city .
He had been convicted of arranging the murder of a man trying to blackmail him for attempting to assassinate a business partner .
Sixty - eight different crimes — more than half non-violent offenses such as tax evasion and drug smuggling — are punishable by death in China .
That means the death vans are likely to keep rolling .
" If we abolish the death penalty , then crime will grow , " Kang says .

The Buddhabrot Technique
by Melinda Green
I was later pleased to learn that a computer artist named Lori Gardi , who I had described this technique to several years ago , has since devoted a great deal of her creative effort to generating various high - resolution images using the technique .
She named it Buddhabrot which is a name I instantly loved and have adopted .
Lori's web site contains some reduced examples of her work along with her writings into the mystical connections she 's made between the Mandelbrot set and Buddhism .
The above image shows the overall entire Buddhabrot object .
To produce the image only requires some very simple modifications to the traditional mandelbrot rendering technique : Instead of selecting initial points on the real - complex plane one for each pixel , initial points are selected randomly from the image region or larger as needed .
Then , each initial point is iterated using the standard mandelbrot function in order to first test whether it escapes from the region near the origin or not .
Only those that do escape are then re-iterated in a second , pass .
( The ones that do n't escape - I.E. which are believed to be within the Mandelbrot Set - are ignored ) .
During re-iteration , I increment a counter for each pixel that it lands on before eventually exiting .
Every so often , the current array of " hit counts " is output as a grayscale image .
Eventually , successive images barely differ from each other , ultimately converging on the one above .
I 'm the most unreligious person you could ever meet , but it 's hard not to think of this image as revealing God hiding in the Mandelbrot Set .
And not hiding in some tiny corner , but a single image hiding in plain sight at full - size , suggesting that the Hindus were the ones who got it right .
After a long time generating greyscale images I realized that there is a natural way to use color to display more information within the Buddhabrot images .
Notice that basic Buddhabrot images are generated by choosing a " maximum iterations " threshold just as for Mandelbrot images .
One main difference between the two techniques is that Buddhabrot images have distinctly different appearances depending on the choice of threshold , whereas the effect of different threshold values for mandelbrot images only changes the amount of black ( unresolved ) pixels .
I realized that I should be able to generate meaningful color Buddhabrot images by generating three basic images that differ only in the choice of threshold values , and then combining those images as the red , green , and blue channels of a single color image .
This is exactly the same technique that astronomers use when generating " false - color " images of astronomical objects .
For example , see the famous Eagle Nebula images from the Hubble Space Telescope and read the associated descriptions of color astronomomical mages .
For my color Buddhabrot images the three different threshold values are analogous to the different frequencies of light which NASA combined into their beautiful false - color images .
After some years I realized how to unify all the Mandel / Julia / Buddhabrot objects and techniques .
Click the following link to learn about this interesting extension called the Buddhabrot Hologram .
Still later while exploring different ways to sample and project these sorts of images , one really surprising thing happened :
In one particular rendering projected onto one of the six major planes an image ofthe logistic map simply popped out !
( There are 6 major planes in 4D just like the 3 in 3D . )
This had me puzzled for years until 2009 when Taneli Hautaniemi also found it and contacted me .
In 2010 , Piet en Gilberte then stepped in and made a beautiful animation showing the relationship and added it along with explaination to the Buddhabrot page on Wikipedia .
Thanks ,
Piet !
Finally , below is a single frame part way through a run generating a low - resolution view of the main figure .
Just for fun , I also compiled a set of those frames into an animated GIF file which you can view to see how the image converges over time .
Clicking on the image will bring you that animated GIF , but beware since it is over three megabytes which will take a very long time to download completely unless you have a fast internet connection .
With a 28.8 K modem this will be around 30 minutes .
the good news is that you can start watching the animation as it streams across the net to you .
Once it 's fully downloaded , it will loop quickly through the frames and you can watch the Buddha come swimming out of the void .
The complete animation took around half an hour to generate on a P233 Laptop PC .
Alex Boswell found an almost magical way to vastly speed the renderingof highly zoomed regions .
Click here for an example .
Albert Lobo has produced a simply gorgeous music video exploration of the Buddhabrot in 4D .
View it on YouTube or download the 22 MB high - res version .
Benedikt Bitterli later produced a beautiful 4 K video with clever speed - ups and denoising .
He provides several video frames there suitable for wallpaper .
I particularly liked the image to the right which he generously rendered for me in 16 K which I had printed and framed .
You can get that rendering here .

Flying Without ID
According to the TSA , in the 9th Circuit Case of John Gilmore , you are allowed to fly without showing ID — you ’ll just have to submit yourself to secondary screening .
The Identity Project wants you to try it out .
If you have time , try to fly without showing ID .
Mr. Gilmore recommends that every traveler who is concerned with privacy or anonymity should opt to become a “ selectee ” rather than show an ID .
We are very likely to lose the right to travel anonymously , if citizens do not exercise it .
TSA and the airlines will attempt to make it inconvenient for you , by wasting your time and hassling you , but they ca n’t do much in that regard without compromising their avowed missions , which are to transport paying passengers , and to keep weapons off planes .
If you never served in the armed services , this is a much easier way to spend some time keeping your society free .
( Bring a copy of the court decision with you and point out some of the numerous places it says you can fly as a selectee rather than show ID .
Paper tickets are also helpful , though not required . )
I ’m curious what the results are .

Here ’s someone who tried , and failed .

After the break , a chat with the architect of unreality on the theory and implementation of his crooked house .
And so a graduate student in Stanford ’s math department has managed to create , more than 60 years after Heinlein first conceived it , a home that seems to exist in more than three dimensions , a kind of multi-directional Mobius strip .
( Metaphysics in the metaverse ? )
Watch the video , and see what happens after Seifert hits the button .
Things get odd in the crooked house of Seifert Surface , located hundreds of meters up above an island called , appropriately enough , The Future .
But it does n't require an earthquake .
To enter the hyper - dimensionality of Seifert ’s home , all that ’s necessary is to push the big button on the marble table in the foyer .
From that point , you ’re sucked into its warped , infinite reality .
In Robert A. Heinlein 's classic short story , “ — And He Built a Crooked House ” , a cheerfully deranged architect builds a Los Angeles home shaped like a tesseract , a four dimensional hypercube .
His idea is to invent a revolutionary new building that 'll save space ( after all , if a home exists in four dimensions , you get a lot more square footage to work with ) , but an earthquake shifts the house into still another dimension .
And then things start to get strange from there .
Seifert ’s house seems normal enough , when you first enter it .
( Other than being suspended high up the sky , that is , for reasons that ’ll soon be obvious . )
The strangeness sets in when you push the button and go from room to room -- through doors , up ladders , sometimes through hatches -- and realize that you are somehow walking in circles .
And that you ’re also in a house that seems to have been designed by Escher .
“ It ’s the eight cube sides of a four dimensional hypercube , ” Seifert explains .
“ Just like a normal 3D cube has six square sides , and a normal 2D square has four line sides , so the sequence continues .
And just like if you were an ant walking on the faces of a cube , if you go four times in one direction , you end up back where you started .
Also , if you make three ninety degree turns , you come back where you started . ”
Essentially , he finishes , “ I want the avatar to walk around and see what you would see if you were walking through the cube faces of a hypercube , like the ant sees what it sees , walking around on the square faces of a cube . ”
That ’s the theory , but how is this possible ?
Rather than write out the explanation , maybe it ’s better to first move our camera back , outside the house .
Now watch Seifert Surface walking through his crooked house .
You 'll see Seifert begin his reality - warping journey in the doorway of the center room ( direct video link here ) :
So the crooked house is quite crooked — programmed to literally move rooms into place , so that the person inside is always in the hypercube .
“ When you step into a room , ” Surface tells me , “ the other rooms cluster around it so that they ’re always connected together the right way .
But it only works for one focus . ”
In other words , it ’s all relative : click the Focus button , and stay in the reality of the tesseract .
Don’t , and remain in the basic Second Life reality of 3D objects that more or less operate according to Newtownian physics .
So if you ’re sitting in the crooked house while someone else takes the focus , the house spins and rotates to adjust , to maintain the illusion .
( Unless you ’re sitting down , you ’re liable to get unceremoniously booted out in mid-air . )
Crooked house prototype
To chart out the algorithm of shifting rooms , Seifert Surface created a much smaller prototype .
“ [ B]asically the focus cube tells all the rest that it ’s [ the ] focus , and where it is , and what its rotation is .
And the other cubes move to match up . ”
From there , it was mostly a matter of creating the human - sized version , building a 19th century era interior with textures and furniture provided by Desmond Shang , and taking advantage of a Linden Script Language coding hack released on the Forum by Keknehv Psaltery , which helped him speed up the movement of the rooms past LSL 's default maximum velocity for moving objects .
Though he ’s a grad student of three dimensional topology and geometry at Stanford , and his real life studies inspired this project ( along with other mathematical condunrums he ’s created in Second Life ) they are n’t part of his day - to - day studies , which are pure math on the most abstract order .
“ It ’s the kind of thing that might be useful in 200 years time , ” he shrugs , “ who knows . ”
Which may explain why it ’s so difficult for him to explain the concept of the tesseract to me , even when he creates an impromptu 2D model of a cube splayed out on the ground .
I finally give up and describe it as a 3D Mobius strip .
“ Yeah , ” he allows , “ that ’s a pretty good way to think about it , except Mobius strips have a twist .
And this does n’t . ”
“ Well , the ' twist ' is you moving all the rooms around behind our back ! ”
He laughs in the foyer of his crooked house .
“ Well , the formal term would be " orientability " .
The Mobius strip is non-orientable , this thing is orientable . ”
“ That 's a nice way to say ‘ F ***- ing with a dude 's head ’ , " I observe .
Seifert Surface grins .
“ It ’s one of my favorite past times in Second Life . ”
Vom Millionär zum Tellerwäscher
Barbara Ehrenreich sucht in „ Qualifiziert & arbeitslos “ vergeblich einen einträglichen Job .
Stattdessen findet Ehrenreich eine von Abstiegsängsten verunsicherte US - Mittelklasse , die nicht begreift , dass sie der neue Kollateralschaden des Turbokapitalismus ist
Die Angestellten sind einfach viel anfälliger für die Psychoquacksalberei der Bewerbungsbranche als Arbeiter
VON STEFAN REINECKE
Jeder Tellerwäscher kann es zum Millionär bringen .
Diese Metapher des amerikanischen Traums existiert noch immer .
Doch : Die Leser des New York Times Magazine mussten 2003 feststellen , dass die Wirklichkeit dieses Klischee mitunter vom Kopf auf die Füße stellt .
Dort wurde der Fall eines leitenden Angestellten geschildert , der 300.000 Dollar im Jahr verdiente , bis ihn seine Firma vor die Tür setzte .
Zwei Jahre lang suchte er vergeblich einen neuen Job , dann bekam er einen : als Verkäufer beim Bekleidungseinzelhändler Gap .
In den USA kann man derzeit also eher vom Millionär zum Tellerwäscher werden .
Dieser Fall mag extrem sein – aber er scheint etwas Neues zu verdeutlichen : Arbeitslos werden längst nicht mehr nur schlecht ausgebildete blue collar worker , deren Jobs in Billiglohnländer exportiert werden .
Ausgemustert werden auch Akademiker , mittlere Manager und höhere Angestellte .
2004 war jeder fünfte Arbeitslose in den USA zuvor als mittlerer oder höherer Angestellter tätig gewesen .
Rationalisiert und outgesourct wird , auch in Deutschland , bei Banken und Versicherungen .
Die US - Publizistin Barbara Ehrenreich hat in Wallraff ’scher Manier einen Selbstversuch unternommen , um diesem Phänomen auf die Spur zu kommen .
Sie hat sich mit einer neuen Identität als arbeitslose PR - Fachkraft ausgerüstet und in die Abgründe der in den USA blühenden Jobsuche - Branche begeben .
Sie schreibt haufenweise Bewerbungen , preist sich auf Jobmessen an und gibt horrende Summen für Karriereberater aus , die nichts zu bieten haben außer Küchentischpsychologie à la „ Wer an sich glaubt , schafft es auch “ .
Sie hört christlichen Predigern zu , die Gottvertrauen für den entscheidenden Schritt zum neuen Job halten , und treibt sich auf trostlosen Networking - Kongressen in trostlosen Hotels herum .
Ehrenreich beschreibt die Jobsuche - Branche als eine Art Industrie , die weniger der Vermittlung von Arbeit als der Ruhigstellung der Arbeitslosen dient .
Sie schildert dies mit Ironie – und ohne zu verbergen , dass die aggressive Persönlichkeitsmodellierung gelegentlich an Gehirnwäsche erinnert , die auch an ihrem robusten Selbstbewusstsein zerrt .
Warum wehren sich intelligente Leute nicht , die von einem gemeinsamen Schicksal getroffen werden ?
Warum fallen sie auf die trügerische Versprechungen und fast masochistischen Anforderungen der Bewerbungstrainings herein ?
Warum glauben die Exführungskräfte allesamt , dass sie nur wieder lernen müssen , positiv zu denken , um es wieder zu einer vernünftigen Arbeit zu bringen , obwohl sie doch offenkundig Kollateralschäden des Turbokapitalismus sind , in dem weniger Personal fast immer mehr Profit bedeutet ?
Dies sind Variationen der alten linken Frage nach dem falschen Bewusstsein , die im Zentrum dieses Textes steht .
Ehrenreichs Antworten sind interessant – aber nicht erschöpfend .
Klar ist ohnehin :
Wer schlecht ausgebildet ist und nur unqualifizierte Jobs gemacht hat , der hat eben wenig Chancen , wieder akzeptable Arbeit zu finden .
Aber genau das trifft für diese Angestellten keineswegs zu .
Ehrenreich trifft bei ihrer Recherche durchweg gut ausgebildete Leute , die auf blendende Zeugnisse und Karrieren verweisen können und genau deshalb ihrem Schicksal fassungslos gegenüber stehen .
„ Die entlassenen Führungskräfte der großen Unternehmen haben alles richtig gemacht – und sind dennoch ruiniert .
Wenn jemand glaubwürdig das Verschwinden des amerikanischen Traums bezeugen kann , dann sie “ , so das Resümee .
Die Angestellten sind zudem viel anfälliger für die Psychoquacksalberei der Bewerbungsbranche als etwa Arbeiter – aus nahe liegendem Grund .
Eine Krankenschwester oder eine Verkäuferin definiert sich meist über das , was sie tut .
Die leitenden Angestellten hingegen leben , so Ehrenreich , „ in einer Welt , in der die Selbstdarstellung , die ‚ Persönlichkeit ‘ und die ‚ persönliche Einstellung ‘ meist mehr zählen als die Leistung “ .
Deshalb können arbeitslose Führungskräfte kaum anders , als in ihrer mangelhaften Performance die Schuld für ihre Malaise zu erkennen .
Deshalb fallen sie auch auf die durchsichtigen Verheißungen der Bewerbungsbranche herein , die ihnen suggeriert , dass es nur an ihnen selbst liegt .
„ Qualifiziert & arbeitslos “ ist eine Art Fortsetzung von „ Arbeit poor “ ( 2001 ) , einer Sozialreportage , in der sich die Autorin als Billigjobberin verdingt hatte .
„ Qualifiziert & arbeitslos “ hat indes zwei Mängel : einen dramaturgischen und einen analytischen .
Laut Tschechow erwarten wir , dass die Pistole , die im ersten
Akt aufgetaucht ist , im dritten Akt auch losgeht .
Ehrenreichs Bemühungen , einen brauchbaren Job zu ergattern , scheitern hingegen .
Diese Enttäuschung schmälert auch die Kraft des Authentischen , von der dieser
Text lebt .
Der Ausstieg wirkt wie eine willkürliche Zäsur ; er weckt Zweifel , ob diese virtuelle Bewerbungskarriere auch repräsentativ ist .
„ Ich folge meinen Leidensgenossen nicht in die Welt der Überlebensjobs “ , schreibt die Autorin .
Bleibt leitenden Angestellten nach ein paar Monaten Jobsuche wirklich stets nur das Los , sich als Verkäufer bei Wal Mart oder Gap zu verdingen ?
„ Qualifiziert & arbeitslos “ entwirft ein anschauliches Bild der Mentalität der US - Angestelltenkultur , die unfähig ist , ihre eigene Abwicklung zu begreifen .
Lesenswert ist diese Schilderung , weil das Bewerbungsbusiness auch in Europa floriert .
Wenn man den US - typischen religiös aufgeladenen Glauben an das Individuum abzieht , mag man in diesem Text eine Beschreibung unserer Zukunft erkennen .
Allerdings hätte man sich neben der präzisen Schilderung auch eine analytische und historische Weitung des Blicks gewünscht .
Denn der Befund , dass die Mittelklasse hilflos ihrem sozialen Abstieg zuschaut , ist bekannt .
Er stammt unter anderem von Ehrenreich selbst , die dieses Phänomen 1992 in „ Der Absturz “ analysiert hat .
Wer die beiden Bücher parallel liest , fragt sich , ob die soziale Abwärtsmobilität der leitenden Angestellten wirklich eine grundstürzend neue Erscheinung ist .
Ehrenreich argumentiert in „ Qualifiziert & arbeitslos “ , ohne es je explizit auszusprechen , mit einem besseren Gestern , an dem gemessen das Heute als katastrophales Defizit erscheint .
Das ist ungenau .
Was fehlt , ist eine analytische Einordnung der Lage der upper middle class und eine Verortung , wann und warum jenes bessere Gestern endete .
Diese Analyse würde das Bild nicht hübscher machen , aber schärfer .

Browser speed comparisons
Skip to results .
A polite request
Please stop posting this article on sites like Slashdot , Digg , newspapers , etc .
It is old news .
This article is around 2 years old now ( although it has been kept up to date ) , and has been retired - posting it simply shows how long it took you to find it .
It has already been posted on Slashdot enough times , Digg more than enough times , similar sites more times than I can count , as well as newspaper sites all around the world , and far more blogs than I will ever be able to read .
I thank you for your attention , and I am very happy that you found this article interesting or useful enough to read .
However , it really does not need you to post it yet again - all you will do is eat my bandwidth , and I ask you not to do that .
NYTimes , you may wish to note that this is a site where I publish research articles , tutorials , and scripts .
It is not a blog ( language warning ) .
What is this about
There is a speed war on the web .
Browsers compete on many fronts ; security , standards support , features and speed .
Most people are aware of which major browser fails on three of these , but one of them is still open for grabs .
Speed .
Many organisations and users try to claim that their browser is the fastest .
The Opera site claims that Opera is The Fastest Browser on Earth ! .
The Mozilla site claims that Firefox 1.0 empowers you to browse faster ( faster than what ? ) .
Mozilla itself is quoted as being an alternative to Microsoft IE and it's faster to boot .
Apple 's Safari pages claim that Safari loads pages more quickly than any other Mac web browser ( although they failed to show any results for Opera , and their charts fail to show results for pages that contain images ) .
Internet Explorer users often claim that they use it because of its speed , as the alternatives take longer to start and load pages .
Opera and Firefox users are quite vocal on the subject , but none of them can actually show any research to back up their statements , ususally just saying " X takes way longer than Y to start " or " my friend uses X and it is much slower on his computer than Y is on mine " .
Those that did try more than one usually say " X just felt faster than Y when I tried them " ( although this may refer to familiarity with the individual user interface - something that I do not cover here ) .
I have even heard people comparing Firefox and Opera , then realised they were referring to Opera 6 ( even though historically , Opera 6 is about equivalent to Netscape 4 ) , something that was replaced with a completely new engine long before Firefox even existed .
Well , I 've had enough of these unfounded arguments .
I present my research .
This is an honest , unbiased view ( or as unbiased as I can be ) .
Unlike most people , I not only test all the browsers , I test them all on the same computer as each other - grouped into Linux , Mac and Windows ( using the same or equivalent hardware for each ) .
This , I hope , gives an accurate comparison , not only of the browsers compared with each other , but for those that work on multiple platforms , it also gives a fairly accurate comparison of the different optimisations for each platform .
And please , those of you whose browsers did not perform as well as you had hoped , just accept it .
Stop with the comments saying this article is biased .
It does not matter what I use or you use .
This article is not biased .
The fastest browsers are the fastest browsers .
I appreciate browsers for the sake of them being browsers .
I feel no need to tailor tests or alter results to make a browser appear better or worse than it actually is .
The tests
In order to test each browser 's speed response , I put them through a number of tests .
Each test has a careful set of rules to make sure that I give unbiased results .
Each set of tests are grouped by platform , and for each platform , I use just one computer to ensure that the tests compare just the browsers , and not the hardware or software they run on .
Each test is done with a default browser install , without tweaking any settings ( I know that many browsers perform slightly better if you tweak their network settings , but this is intended to be a test of a standard browser install - some people also suggest that using a native skin makes a browser faster , but I got virtually identical results with native and non-native skins ) .
With Browsers that also offer email or news features , I enabled these clients , but did not have any email or news items in them ( some of them may perform differently if they did , but that is not what I was trying to test ) .
The idea was to find out the fastest browser (s ) at performing the major tasks that browser engines are expected to perform .
The basic requirements were HTML , CSS , JavaScript , basic DHTML and images - if the browser engine was not capable of performing these tasks then I am not interested and it was not tested .
The tests are not perfect .
Obviously nothing can be perfect .
But they do give a very good idea of how each browser would cope in each type of situation .
Importantly , the tests were not ( intentially ) tailored towards the strengths or weaknesses of any particular browser .
Cold start
This is the time it takes to do a cold load .
I log out then in , and then once all background processes have completed , I run the browser as the first program .
I use the default settings for the browser , without preloading or quicklaunch tools ( unless the browser installs itself this way , as with Internet Explorer on Windows ) .
The browsers are all set to show a single page on startup , and this page is a locally stored basic HTML page .
Warm start
After completing a cold start , I close the browser , then time how long it takes to start again .
I restart it again another two times , and take an average .
Rendering CSS
To test CSS rendering speed I use a CSS benchmark test devised by nontroppo .
The test measures the time it takes the browser to render a page consisting of almost 2500 positioned DIVs .
The page is stored locally , loaded once to pre-load it , then reloaded 3 times , and the average time taken for those three renderings .
The page is the first page loaded after starting the browser ( after logging out and in ) .
All browsers took significantly longer during the initial load , which is why I discount this initial load , as it does not reflect the reality of normal rendering .
Rendering table
To test table rendering speed I load a local copy of my javascript libraries page .
I ignore this first load and then go back and click the link again ( ensuring the page and all associated files are cached ) .
I then use a script to time how long it takes to render the page .
I take the average of three loads .
Script speed
To test scripting speed I use the fantastic benchmarking tool at 24fun.com .
This is intended for testing multiple browsers on one computer to see how well they perform compared with each other .
Small variations in hardware or software can cause big differences in results so it is important that all tests are done on the same computer .
After logging out and logging in , I load a browser , clear its cache , enable popups ( a requirement of the tests ) , and then run the tests .
The tool tests a good variety of different things , including mathematical calculations , DHTML , string manipulation , image swapping , table manipulation , page content manipulation and window management .
With most browsers I test twice and take an average but I did not do that with iCab because it took half an hour the first time , and required me to sit there and babysit it , repeatedly telling it that the script was not an infinite loop , it was just a horrendously slow browser !
Multiple images
This is done to reflect normal web site handling .
I make the browser load a page containing several small images .
This requires multiple server connections ( or keepalive ) and is a good test to see how well the browser manages its network connections , as well as how well it can cope with rendering multiple images simultaneously .
After logging out and logging in , I load a browser , clear its cache , then I use Google image search to search for the word ' solid ' .
This ensures that any referenced pages are pre-cached , and any required DNS lookups are completed , to minimise the effects of DNS delays .
Then I load use Google image search to search for three more words ( pine , red , stone - do n't blame me for the results that come up , I was n't expecting them either ) , and I use the average load time of these three pages .
( The timer starts when I hit ' search ' , and stops when all images have completed loading . )
My connection speed is 100 Mbps and has no discernable effect on the results .
I have also tested it on a 700 Kbps connection and got similar results .
Google search time is typically below 0.03 seconds .
History Something that is commonly overlooked when checking browser speed , but is very important to overall browsing speed .
I use Google image search to search for pine , and I navigate through the result pages 1 to 25 .
I then start the timer , and go back as quickly as possible to the first result page , then forward as quickly as possible to page 25 again .
Each intermediate page must be allowed to load completely - including images - before moving to the next page .
( This means that any indicators that the browser provides to show that the page is loading must show the page as loaded before navigating to the next page ) .
I use the fastest means the browser has to navigate , which typically means using keyboard shortcuts .
This test demonstrates how efficiently the browser uses caching in order to improve browsing speed .
Note : I did not test plugins like Java or Flash , as these are external programs , and not the browsers themselves .
They are affected much more significantly by their own version numbers or memory contraints of the Operating Syetem , and are not really in the browser 's own control .
Test results
Sorted alphabetically :
Test results are shown by default in tabular form .
If your browser 's scripting engine is up to the task , you can click on the column headings to sort the table by that heading .
The fastest browser is marked in each test using light green , or salmon if it was the fastest , but made mistakes trying to obtain that speed .
Some results also have more information , that will appear in a tooltip when you hold your mouse over the result .
These can be identified in good browsers ( I have done an ugly DHTML behaviour to make this happen in Internet Explorer as well - this excuse - for - a - browser is really annoying me ) by the Help cursor that the mouse should use while you hold it over those results , and by the » character .
If your browser 's scripting engine is good enough , and you enable script , you can view the results in graph format , where you can choose what operating system or browser you want to see results graphed for .
Linux browsers
The tests are done on SuSE Linux 9.1 , using KDE ( except Epiphany , whose results are shown for Gnome , as that is its normal operating environment ) .
I also tested the browsers on Gnome , but only got significantly different results in Konqueror , so that is the only browser 's result I will show for both Gnome and KDE .
I only concentrate on the main Gecko based browsers - there are many variants available .
Mozilla ( SeaMonkey ) , Firefox and Epiphany are the ones I will test , as these are either the official releases from Mozilla.org , or the official browser of the Gnome DTE .
I could not test Galeon ( one of the most popular Gnome browsers ) as it was not available for the Mozilla version I had installed .
However , since it is just a fancy skin for Mozilla ( like Epiphany ) , it 's times are likely to be similar to Mozilla's .
Opera 8 tests were done using Opera 8 beta 1 . Mozilla 1.8 tests were done using Mozilla 1.8 alpha 6 . Firefox 1.5 tests were done using Firefox 1.5 beta 2 . Opera 9 tests were done using Opera 9 technical preview 1 .
NOTE : I have updated the page after discovering that I had done the multiple image test with Opera 8 on Linux set to ' ID as Opera ' ( not the default setting ) .
This is important because Google uses the wrong HTTP header to check if the browser can handle a gzip compressed page , which Opera can .
Instead of checking the Accept - Encoding header , which correctly says this , they check the User - Agent , and only use gzip if the browser claims to be Mozilla or MSIE ( other browsers like Safari and Konqueror are also included in this ) .
Setting Opera to use ' ID as MSIE ' ( default setting ) or ' ID as Mozilla 5.0 ' makes Google send it the compressed version as well .
This makes a huge difference , from Opera appearing to be almost the slowest at 2.50 seconds , to being clearly the fastest at 1.82 seconds .

Mac browsers
I concentrate mainly on browsers for Mac OS X because no browsers for Mac OS 9 are currently in development ( with the exception of iCab ; IE 5 is no longer being updated .
There is no standard recent release of Mozilla or related browsers for OS 9 .
Opera 7 is not being released for OS 9 .
Safari , OmniWeb and related browsers only work on OS X ) .
Opera 8 tests were done using Opera 8 technical preview 1 . Mozilla 1.8 tests were done using Mozilla 1.8 alpha 6 . Firefox 1.5 tests were done using Firefox 1.5 beta 2 . Opera 9 tests were done using Opera 9 technical preview 1 .
The tests are done on Mac OS X 10.3.7 ( Panther ) with the exception of the Safari 2.0 test that is done on a 10.4 ( Tiger ) preview .
( I tested the other browsers on Tiger as well just to make sure this was a fair test , and got virutally identical responses as with Panther . )
The Safari 2.0 update shows an impressive performance improvement with CSS , DHTML and window handling .
The Opera 8 update has also shown a significant improvement , nearly doubling its scripting speed , and improving load time and cache handling .
( For more Opera / Mac related tests , see my Opera for Mac speed improvements article . )

Windows browsers
The tests are done on Windows XP SP2 .
Internet Eplorer 6 is a standard install , Internet Explorer 5 is the zip package install that can be downloaded from QuirksMode.org .
( IE 5.5 crashed every time I tried to run it . )
The Windows performance settings are set to the automatic setting ( default ) .
Opera 8 tests were done using Opera 8 beta 1 . Mozilla 1.8 tests were done using Mozilla 1.8 alpha 6 . Firefox 1.5 tests were done using Firefox 1.5 beta 2 . Opera 9 tests were done using Opera 9 technical preview 1 .
I also tested the Moox Firefox install , " optimised " for my particular processer .
I tested the new Netscape , which is basically Firefox with some added rubbish that slows it down .
K- Meleon is the only other Gecko browser I tested , as is said to be the fastest one ( although in fact it is slower than Mozilla and Firefox at all tasks except starting ) .
I also tested a few browsers that are not current browsers ( Netscape 4 , Escape 4 , Clue , Internet Explorer 5.0 , Mozilla 1.0 , Opera 6.03 ) .
This is done purely for the sake of interest ( and it is interesting to note that IE 5.0 is significantly faster than IE 6.0 ) .

Conclusions
No , no .
That is up to you .
It all depends on how you use your browser and what you use it for , and what operating system (s ) you use it on .
Take a look at the tables ( and graphs , if your browser 's scripting engine is up to the task ) and work it out for yourself .
Ok , ok .
Firefox and Mozilla are clearly optimised for Linux , and Opera is clearly optimised for Windows .
These optimisations are mostly obvious with the loading times , although there is also a little difference in the cache handling on the different operating systems .
However , Opera seems to perform admirably well on most tasks , on any platform .
When it comes to page rendering ( tables , CSS or images ) , most of the major browsers perform very fast , with very little to distinguish between them .
When it comes to scripts , Opera clearly holds its head above the others , nearly twice as fast as the others .
The only one that comes close is Safari 2.0 , but that is tied to the Tiger release of Mac OS ( the recent WebKit nightlies claim to have a 20 - 30 % speed increase on the JavaScript tests I use , but I recorded it taking a second longer - a much faster machine showed a similar slowdown ) .
Opera also is a clear winner using history .
In fact , on Linux it is faster than Mozilla and Firefox for all except starting time .
On Mac and Windows , Opera is faster than Mozilla and Firefox for all tasks .
Surprisingly , Mozilla is faster at most tasks than Firefox ( please do n't send me any more emails about this line , I am well aware of why it is faster ) .
Internet Explorer on Windows was either as fast as - or faster than Mozilla and Firefox for most tasks , with the exception of scripts , where it took over twice as long .
Internet Explorer 7 is closing the gap a little , but the difference is still noticeable .
Of course , its poor standards and security clearly make it a much less attractive prospect .
The Moox Firefox install is actually slower than the standard Firefox versions distributed from Mozilla.org , even though it is supposedly optimised for my particular processor .
The Mac optimised version is a bit better , but trades performance in one area for performance in another , making little or no difference overall .
The performance of K - Meleon and Epiphany was similar to the performance of Mozilla and Firefox on the same platform .
The new Netscape Browser preview ( based on Firefox ) was clearly suffering from bloat caused by the AOL add - ons .
Firefox 2 is slower in almost every respect than Firefox 1.5 , but this may be due to its being a beta , so it may have debugging settings slowing it down .
I will retest Firefox 2 final .
For those of you who commented that security has nothing to do with speed , try saying the same thing after you have spent hours ( or days ) cleaning malware off your computer , caused by you running an insecure browser .
Overall , the time you waste cleaning up malware more than counterbalances the few seconds you save with the faster engine .
And as for standards support , well , speed is not much use if pages are forced to be more bloated and therefore slower to load , simply because the engine does not attempt to support current standards .
For example , try seeing how much longer it takes to load a page if it is made using several levels of nested tables instead of clean CSS styling , or one that has to use Dean Edwards ' IE7 script library just to get the page to render correctly .
From a humorous perspective , it is interesting to note that IE on Windows is slowing down , in the majority of tests .
Browsers that use the underlying IE engine ( Maxthon or Avant , etc. ) generally make IE slower , although Avant manages to make an increase in scripting speed .
Opera 6 was also slightly faster at rendering simple pages than Opera 7 - 9 on windows and linux , but this is easily outweighed by its slow and outdated script support , lack of reflow and progressive rendering , slower image and network handling , and slower history on Mac and Linux .
On the other hand , Mozilla has clearly improved a tremendous amount since it 's original 1.0 release ( which was actually slower in most respects than its Netscape 4 ancestor ) , but it still has a lot of catching up to do before its scripting engine can match Opera's .
And it still has competition .
Opera 's already faster scripting engine nearly doubled in speed in the 8.0 release , and remains fast in the 9.0 release .
Opera 9 is actually very slightly slower than Opera 8 in the JavaScript speed , but because I round the time to the nearest second , you will not see that in the tables .
The change in speed seems to be caused by the address bar being visible in the popups test , so hopefully it will not have a noticeable affect on any real Web pages .
One thing I do not take into account here ( although it can play a significant role in real pages ) is progressive rendering .
For example , with Opera 6 , the table was laid out faster , but nothing was displayed until the entire table was complete .
With Opera 7 + , the table takes longer to complete ( about half a second ) , but it is progressively displayed , so the first part is displayed as soon as it is ready , without having to wait for the rest of the table to complete .
As a result , you can actually start reading the page faster with Opera 7 +.
With pages that are served by slow servers ( or if you have a slower connection ) , this can make overall browsing speed significantly faster .
The fastest browsers at starting are the less commonly used Konqueror 3.2 ( only on KDE ) , Camino 0.8 and iCab 2 , with Konqueror by far the fastest at a warm start .
However , it has one of the slowest script implementations of all the major browsers on Linux , and even though its cache handling is a bit faster on Gnome , its slow startup time on Gnome outweighs the benefit of better caching .
The 3.5.3 release was supposed to have performance improvements , but while the startup time has been reduced a little , and CSS is a little faster , this has been at the expense of its history handling and JavaScript engine , which are now even slower than before .
The only browsers that are slower at scripts are Opera 6 and Mozilla 1.0 , both of which are old releases that have long since been replaced with much faster versions .
Camino 1.0 has adopted a newer version of the engine , and now its startup time is much closer to those of the other Gecko browsers ( Firefox and Mozilla ) , so its main advantage has been lost .
Konqueror 's sister browsers ; Safari 1.2 and OmniWeb are also extremely slow at scripting .
IE for Mac is also slow at scripting , and although it is fast enough to start , it is slow for the other tasks .
iCab and ( old ) OmniWeb 4.2 are the clear losers on Mac , with OmniWeb 4.2 being the slowest at tables and CSS , and failing completely to run the script tests .
iCab 3 managed to produce the slowest scripting engine time , taking over half an hour - over ten times as long as any other Mac browser , and the slowest CSS time of any current browser , taking nearly 20 minutes ( note , also see supplementary Amaya results below ) .
Safari 2.0 has made an impressive advance compared with Safari 1.2 , in both scripting and rendering .
iCab 3 has made significant advances in its CSS and scripting capabilities , but this has been at the expense of making it perform noticably slower than before at almost all tasks .
Supposedly it has not yet been optimised for speed ( since it is currently in closed beta ) , but it has a long way to go , and it is doubtful that any optimisations will make much of a difference .
On Mac OS 9 the browsers generally perform slightly better than the same versions on Mac OS X .
However , these versions have long since been left behind by newer and much faster releases that are not available on OS 9 .
iCab 2 is the fastest at starting but then fails to perform well enough on most of the other tests .
iCab 3 may have far better capabilities , but it is slower as a result , and fails at some tasks that iCab 2 managed to perform .
The other browsers are generally very slow at scripting , CSS rendering , history , and none of them are particularly fast at starting either .
The java browsers all performed very badly at scripting , most seemed to have a lot of trouble manipulating strings or performing calculations .
ICEbrowser , although initially one of the slowest to start , was the clear winner at all other tasks , as well as having the most up - to - date scripting and CSS engines .
Clue was clearly the worst browser , failing to run most of the tests .
Well , at least I got it to start .
To summarise
So overall , Opera seems to be the fastest browser for Windows .
Firefox is not faster than Internet Explorer , except for scripting , but for standards support , security and features , it is a better choice .
However , it is still not as fast as Opera , and Opera also offers a high level of standards support , security and features .
On Linux , Konqueror is the fastest for starting and viewing basic pages on KDE , but as soon as script or images are involved , or you want to use the back or forward buttons , or if you use Gnome , Opera is a faster choice , even though on KDE it will take a few seconds longer to start .
Mozilla and Firefox give an overall good performance , but their script , cache handling and image - based page speed still cannot compare with Opera .
On Mac OS X , Opera and Safari are both very fast , with Safari 2 being faster at starting and rendering CSS , but with Opera still being distinguishably faster for rendering tables , scripting and history ( especially compared with the much slower Safari 1.2 ) .
Camino 0.8 is fast to start , but then it joins its sisters Mozilla and Firefox further down the list .
Neither Mozilla , Firefox nor IE perform very well on Mac , being generally slower than on other operating systems .
On Mac OS 9 , no single browser stands out as the fastest .
In fact , my condolences to anyone who has to use one of them , they all perform badly .
These results are drawn from my tests as shown above , and are confirmed by my personal use .
Please do not send me hate mail saying I have insulted your browser or whatever .
If you get different results , try doing what I did .
Perform a set of tests like these that cover the major areas of use .
Make sure you do it unbiased , cross platform , using the same or equivalent spec on each ( make sure you use the same amount of RAM in each ) .
Once you are done , do n't tell me about it .
Publish your own results , as I have done , with a discussion of why you did each test and what it represents .
Facts and figures are everything .
Oh , and do n't just say " I could n't get it to install so I did n't bother " - you have no idea how much work I put into getting all these browsers to install on these operating systems ( as my wife and the IRC community would be able to testify to ) .
If you can't get it to install , then that is your problem , it says nothing about speed , and simply makes your results incomplete .
Updating the results
This article is now retired .
It was a tough decision , and I know that many of you have come to depend on the information in this article , but I have faithfully maintained it for nearly two years now , and the time has come .
The main reasons for retiring it are financial and practical ;
Many of you have asked me to retest on new hardware , but it took several months to build it to what it is now , and retesting all of them on new hardware is out of the question .
However , computers are moving on , and my testing machines are no longer considered normal .
I could continue testing on the current hardware , and allow you to scale the results ( after all , it does not matter what the performance is , as long as the differences between the browsers can be seen ) .
However , Apple are forcing my hand .
They will not allow me to test new versions of Safari until I buy a new operating system , even though the one I have is only a little over a year old .
Even Microsoft are not that bad ( I can still run IE 7 on an operating system released 5 years ago ) .
Apple have simply outpriced themselves , I will not upgrade .
If I did upgrade , I would , of course , introduce a bias .
I would have to retest all other browsers on that system , and I have already said that I will not do that .
Apple have also switched to very different hardware .
All new Macs use Intel based chips instead of the older G - series .
The performance of Safari on these is different .
I have heard that Safari's JavaScript is faster , as fast as Opera in most cases , or sometimes faster .
I cannot prove that without buying one for myself , and sorry , but no way .
I would then have to retest all the browsers on it ( see a pattern here ? ) .
I reserve to right to change my mind and update it later anyway , but it will only be if I want to , and see a good enough reason to ( and a way to do it without introducing an unnecessary bias ) .
Please , enjoy the article as it is now , and do not email me to ask for updates .
The results generally scale quite well onto newer hardware , and the browsers ' performances can be seen not to change too much in most cases within minor releases ( or even major releases in the case of browser skins ) .
This article will remain in its current state on this site .
As a final word , I wish to re-iterate that I have done my best to maintain a standard throughout updates .
I have never allowed my employment status , my own browser of choice , or any company to sway my results .
This article was written to satisfy my own curiosity , and I do not want to lie to myself , or my readers .
I have maintained as consistent a set of hardware and software as possible , to ensure my results remain accurate .
Therefore you can view the article as it stands now as an honest reference , and I hope it remains of use to you .
Supplementary results
I also tested a few other browsers that were not up to the required capability spec , but are used for accessibility , or general speed reasons , or often by system administrators who do not have a GUI .
In several tests , Lynx and Links2 were so fast that it was nearly impossible to time , as pages were often loaded faster than buttons could be pressed .
Amaya and HotJava are concept browsers , and are included just for the sake of interest .
All tests were on SuSE Linux 9.1 with KDE , except HotJava which was done on Windows XP ( as with the other Java browsers ) .

MIAMI , Nov. 20 — When I was a new faculty physician , I worked with a resident doctor who was smart and energetic and took excellent care of her patients .
There was just one problem .
As she delivered her thoughtful patient presentations to me and the other attending doctors , it was hard not to notice her low - cut dress .
“ You two have to say something to her , ” one of my male colleagues said to me and another female doctor one afternoon .
But while none of us would have hesitated to intervene had she prescribed the wrong drug for a patient , we felt weird saying something to her about her clothes .
So we did n’t .
Nearly a decade later , my impression is that more young physicians and students are dressing like that resident .
Every day , it seems , I see a bit of midriff here , a plunging neckline there .
Open - toed sandals , displaying brightly manicured toes , seem ubiquitous .

AI ( id ) 関数の中身を編集して AI を変更できます 。
基礎的なホムの行動、すなわち移動、攻撃、スキル使用等の関数は
ROクライアントプログラムに含まれています。自分が構想した適切な状況で、
提供される関数を実行させれば良いです。
構成
各種AIファイルは以下のようになっています。
AI /
基本AI ファイルを置くフォルダです。
基本AIファイルのアップデートで変更されます。
AI / USER_AI /
ユーザ ーAIファイルを置くフォルダです。
基本AIファイルのアップデートで変更されません。
Const.lua は、ROクライアントプログラム内の各種定数に対する情報を持っています。
これは AI.lua と Util.lua から参照されます。
Const.lua と Util.lua は、 AI.lua から参照されるようになっています。
現在 Util.lua にはリスト、いくつかの単純な機能の計算関数があります。
ホムンクル スAIの必須条件は AI.lua ファイルと AI.lua ファイル内に定義され た
AI ( id ) 関数です。この二つの条件が最低条件となります。
すなわち Const.lua 、 Util.lua から選択されます。
しかしスクリプトを作成する時さまざまな情報が必要でしょう？
/hoai
基本AIとユーザ ーAIを切り替えます。
既 存AIフォルダの下に USER_AI フォルダが追加され、 [ / hoai ]
コマンドで順にフォルダ経路が変わるようになります。
ユーザ ーAIファイルは USER_AI フォルダに入れて下さい 。
（ユーザ ーAIファイルは基本AIファイルのアップデートに関係なくそのままになります。）
先行入力
移動と攻撃コマンドを先行入力できます。
Shiftキー とAltキーを押した状態で地面を右クリックすると移動コマンドが先行入力されます。
Shiftキー とAltキーを押した状態で攻撃対象を右クリックすると攻撃コマンドが先行入力されます。

スクリプトファイルは一般的なテキストファイルです。
メモ帳のようなソフトやエディタでスクリプトファイルを作成します。
ただ Lua という言語で書かれているのでファイルの拡張子に lua を使います 。
function AI ( myid ) end
最初にこれを書いてから 、AIフォルダにある既存 AI.lua を他の所に移したり
名前を変更した後、新たに作成したAIファイルをコピーします。
そしてROクライアントを再起動すれば、まともに作動します。
ただ、ホムは何もせず、じっとしています。
人工知能を作成する方法は様々あります。その中で単純で、たくさん使われる方法が 有限状態機械( FSM , Finite State Machine ) です。
有限状態機械 - google
有限状態遷移機械の学術的定義は関連書籍に詳しく出ていますが、
普通の方が常識的に理解していることです。
主題として、私のホムンクルスを例にあげます。
まずホムンクルスにどんな行動をとってほしいですか？
では、例を書いてみます。
主人を攻撃する物体を見つけて攻撃しなさい。
周りにモンスターがいれば先に攻撃しなさい。または、攻撃を受けなさい（けがをします^^ ;;）
主人から遠く離れず一定距離を保ちなさい。
等々
状況によって幾多の要求事項があります。
要求事項が整理できたら、これからホムンクルスの立場になって考えて見ましょう。
待機 ( IDLE )
周りに何らのモンスターがいなくて主人もじっとする状況を思い浮かべます。
そのまま待機する状態です。
追跡 ( CHASE )
主人が攻撃され、ホムも攻撃されたら攻撃した物体をホムが敵に認識して追い掛けなければなりません。
何かを追い掛ける状態です。
攻撃 ( ATTACK )
少なくとも攻撃範囲の中にあれば物理攻撃やスキルを使います。
何かと戦う状態です 。
追従 ( FOLLOW )
少なくとも消滅または、追い掛けることができない位遠く逃げてしまえば
もう主人の元に戻らなければなりません。
主人に追従する状態です。
上で言った四大状態をそれぞれ待機 ( IDLE ) , 追跡 ( CHASE ) , 攻撃 ( ATTACK ) , 追従 ( FOLLOW ) 状態と
定義します 。
そして各状態でどんな事態が起きたら別の状態に変化するかどうかを決めます。
そして各状態でしなければならないことを決めておきます。
いくつかの条件設定をもっと追加した後、これを図に描くと以下の通りになります。
有限状態遷移 図
くま○〜さんによる詳しい状態遷移図を引用します。
最初の状態は待機状態です。周り状況の変化によってホムの状態は変化します。
そしてその都度、適切な行動をするように設定すればいいです。
もう目的は決まったのでいくつかの準備から実際にスクリプトを作成します。
どんな作業をする時でも、私は便利な作業のために道具を準備します。
ホムンクルス のAIを作ろうとすれば必須要素である AI.lua と AI ( id ) 関数だ け
あればよいのですが、あらかじめいくつかの道具を作っておいた方が良いです。
この道具は主にテーブルや関数の形式です。
これらを Util.lua に作成し、 AI.lua で参照するようにします。
空のファイルの一番上に Const.lua を参照するよ う
を書いてください 。
色々なデータを順に保存して、順に取り出すためのリストが必要な場合があります。
ホムンクルスの人工知能の場合は予約コマンドを順に保存して取り出して来る必要があります。
リストの名前 を List と言っていくつかの関数を追加します 。
（ Util.lua 参照）
List.new ( ) -- 新しいリスト（返り値） List. pushleft ( list , value ) -- リストの左側に要素追加 List. pushright ( list , value ) -- リストの右側に要素追加 List.popleft ( list ) -- リストの左側最初の値を取り出す List.popright ( list ) -- リストの右側最初の値を取り出す List.clear ( list ) -- リストをクリアする List.size ( list ) -- リストに入っている要素の個数
よく使われるいくつかの計算関数も追加します。
GetDistance ( x1 , y1,x2,y2 ) -- 二つの座標間のセル距離（定数） GetDistance2 ( id1 , id2 ) -- 二つの物体間のセル距離（定数） GetOwnerPosition ( id ) -- 主人の位置 GetDistanceFromOwner ( id ) -- 主人との距離 IsOutOfSight ( id1,id2 ) -- id1 と id2 がお互いに見える距離なら true , 見えない距離なら false を返します 。
IsInAttackSight ( id1,id2 ) -- id1 の攻撃やスキル使用範囲に id2 が入っていれば true , 入っていなければ false を返します 。
では、 AI.lua を作成してみましょう。空白のみのテキストファイルを一つ作り、
AI.lua に名前を変えます。メモ帳で AI.lua ファイルを開きます。
ファイル内の一番上 に Const.lua , Util.lua を参照するように
を書いてください 。
以下の空白に要素（関数）
function AI ( myid ) end
は少なくとも必須です 。
これだけでも、一つ のAIが出来上がります。 しかし、空っぽな AI ( myid ) 関数からなる AI を使うと、 ゲーム内でホムンクルスはそのままじっとしています。 これは最終目的ではありません 。
目的のいくつかの状態を定義します。
IDLE_ST = 0 -- 待機状態 FOLLOW_ST = 1 -- 主人追従状態 CHASE_ST = 2 -- ターゲット追跡状態 ATTACK_ST = 3 -- 攻撃状態
そして現在ホムンクルスの状態を保存する変数が必要です。
またホムンクルスのid , 敵id , 目的地座標等々も保存する必要があります 。
ホムンクルスの状態は、最初は待機状態です。
------------------------------------------ -- グローバル変数（プログラム全体で共通で使うフラグみたいなもの）
------------------------------------------
MyState = IDLE_ST -- ホムの現在状態( 初期値は待機状態 )
MyEnemy = 0 -- ホムがターゲットしている敵のキャラクターID MyDestX = 0 -- ホムの目標座標X（移動先 / スキル使用座標） MyDestY = 0 -- ホムの目標座標Y（移動先 / スキル使用座標） MyPatrolX = 0 -- ホムがパトロール（往復移動）する始点座標X MyPatrolY = 0 -- ホムがパトロール（往復移動）する始点座標Y -- ( 主人が先行で複数コマンド入力した場合、ここに順番に記憶されます)
ResCmdList = List.new ( ) -- 先行入力コマンドリスト MyID = 0 -- ホム自身のキャラクターID MySkill = 0 -- ホムが使おうとしているスキル MySkillLevel = 0 -- ホムが使おうとしているスキルレベル
------------------------------------------ function AI ( myid ) MyID = myid -- ホム自身のキャラクターid end
待機状態を処理する関数 OnIDLE_ST ( ) を定義します 。
そして AI ( myid ) 関数内に作動するように編集します 。
function OnIDLE_ST () TraceAI ( " OnIDLE_ST " ) local cmd = List.popleft( ResCmdList ) if ( cmd ~= nil ) then -- コマンド入力があれば ProcessCommand ( cmd ) -- 対応するコマンドの受付処理を行う return end local object = GetOwnerEnemy ( MyID ) -- 主人を攻撃している敵のキャラクターidを取得 if ( object ~= 0 ) then -- 主人を攻撃している敵がいるならば MyState = CHASE_ST -- ホム状態をターゲット追跡状態にする
MyEnemy = object -- objectの敵をターゲットにする
TraceAI ( " IDLE_ST -> CHASE_ST : MYOWNER_ATTACKED_IN " ) return -- 戻る end object = GetMyEnemy ( MyID ) -- ホムの敵のキャラクターidを取得 if ( object ~= 0 ) then -- ホムの敵がいるならば MyState = CHASE_ST -- ホム状態をターゲット追跡状態にする
MyEnemy = object -- objectの敵をターゲットにする
TraceAI ( " IDLE_ST -> CHASE_ST : ATTACKED_IN " ) return -- 戻る end local distance = GetDistanceFromOwner( MyID ) -- 主人との距離を取得 if ( distance > 3 or distance == - 1 ) then -- 主人までの距離が距離が3より遠いか視界外ならば
MyState = FOLLOW_ST -- ホム状態を追従状態にする TraceAI ( " IDLE_ST -> FOLLOW_ST " ) return ; -- 戻る end end function AI ( myid ) MyID = myid -- ホム自身のキャラクターid if ( MyState == IDLE_ST ) then -- 待機状態 OnIDLE_ST ( ) end end
「 主人を攻撃している 」 、「ホムの敵がいる」場合追跡状態に転移します。
この二つとも当てはまらない場合、主人との距離を計算して一定距離以上離れたら
主人追従状態に切り替えます。その場合「主人を攻撃している」、「ホムの敵がいる」
という条件はどうやって判定しますか？
「 主人を攻撃している」と言う条件は周りの物体の中でモンスターであることが
その対象が主人の場合になります。それならモンスターではない一般プレーヤーの
キャラクターが主人を攻撃する場合はどうやって分かりますか？
そのキャラクターの動作を調査して見れば分かります。
function GetOwnerEnemy ( myid ) local result = 0 -- 敵のキャラク ターid local owner = GetV ( V_OWNER , myid ) -- 主人自身のキャラクターid local actors = GetActors ( ) -- 周りのキャラクターidを全部取得 local enemys = {} -- 敵のリスト local index = 1 -- インデックス番号( 初期 値 1 ) local target -- ターゲットのキャラクターid -- ( 1 , actors [ 1 ] ) 、( 2, actors [ 2 ] ) 、…のペアを繰り返す -- 周りのキャラクターidをひとつひとつチェックして、そのキャラクターが -- 主人を攻撃しようとしていたら、敵として敵リストに追加する for i , v in ipairs ( actors ) do if ( v ~= owner and v ~= myid ) then -- 主人かホム自身じゃなければ target = GetV ( V_TARGET , v) -- そのキャラクターのタゲを取得 if ( target == owner ) then -- タゲが主人だったら if ( IsMonster ( v ) == 1 ) then -- モンスターだったら enemys [ index ] = v -- 敵のリストに追加 index = index+1 -- インデックス を1増やす else -- モンスターじゃなければ local motion = GetV( V_MOTION ,i) -- そのキャラクターのモーションを取得 -- モーションが攻撃モーションだったら if ( motion == MOTION_ATTACK or motion == MOTION_ATTACK2 ) then enemys [ index ] = v -- 敵のリストに追加 index = index+1 -- インデックス を1増やす end end end end end local min_dis = 100 -- 最小距 離( 初期値 は100 ) local dis -- 距離 -- ( 1,enemys [ 1 ] ) 、( 2, enemys [ 2 ] ) 、…のペアを繰り返す -- 敵リストの中で、ホムから一番近い敵をホムの攻撃対象とする for i, v in ipairs ( enemys ) do dis = GetDistance2 ( myid , v) -- ホムと敵との距離を取得 if ( dis < min_dis ) then -- 最小距離より近ければ result = v -- その敵をターゲットとする min_dis = dis -- その敵との距離を最小距離とする end end return result -- ターゲットを返す end
結果、値が 0 の場合主人は攻撃を受けていることが分かります。
「 ホムの敵がいる」条件はどうやって判断しますか？
もしホムンクルスがモンスターを先に攻撃するようにしたければ、
周りにモンスターがいたら少なくあると判断すれば良いです。
もしホムンクルスが攻撃を受ける場合だけホムンクルスが応じるようにしたければ、
ホムンクルスを攻撃する対象があるのかを検査すれば良いです。
この二つの中一つの選択は先攻、非先攻ホムンクルスを決めます。
function GetMyEnemy ( myid ) local result = 0 -- 敵のキャラク ターid local type = GetV ( V_HOMUNTYPE , myid ) -- ホムのタイプを取得する -- ホムが LIF か AMISTR ならば if ( type == LIF or type == LIF_H or type == AMISTR or type == AMISTR_H ) then result = GetMyEnemyA ( myid ) -- 敵取得タイプA（非先攻型） -- ホムが FILIR か VANILMIRTH ならば elseif ( type == FILIR or type == FILIR_H or type == VANILMIRTH or type == VANILMIRTH_H ) then result = GetMyEnemyB ( myid ) -- 敵取得タイ プB（先攻型） end return result -- ターゲットを返す end ------------------------------------------- -- 敵取得タイプA（非先攻型）
------------------------------------------- function GetMyEnemyA ( myid ) local result = 0 -- 敵のキャラク ターid local owner = GetV ( V_OWNER , myid ) -- 主人自身のキャラクターid local actors = GetActors ( ) -- 周りのキャラクターidを全部取得 local enemys = {} -- 敵のリスト local index = 1 -- インデックス番号( 初期 値 1 ) local target -- ターゲットのキャラクターid -- ( 1 , actors [ 1 ] ) 、( 2, actors [ 2 ] ) 、…のペアを繰り返す -- 周りのキャラクターidをひとつひとつチェックして、そのキャラクターが -- ホムを攻撃しようとしていたら、敵として敵リストに追加する for i , v in ipairs ( actors ) do if ( v ~= owner and v ~= myid ) then -- 主人かホム自身じゃなければ target = GetV ( V_TARGET , v) -- そのキャラクターのタゲを取得 if ( target == myid ) then -- タゲがホム自身ならば enemys [ index ] = v -- 敵のリストに追加 index = index+1 -- インデックス を1増やす end end end local min_dis = 100 -- 最小距 離( 初期値 は100 ) local dis -- 距離 -- ( 1,enemys [ 1 ] ) 、( 2, enemys [ 2 ] ) 、…のペアを繰り返す -- 敵リストの中で、ホムから一番近い敵をホムの攻撃対象とする for i , v in ipairs ( enemys ) do dis = GetDistance2 ( myid , v) -- ホムと敵との距離を取得 if ( dis < min_dis ) then -- 最小距離より近ければ result = v -- その敵をターゲットとする min_dis = dis -- その敵との距離を最小距離とする end end return result end ------------------------------------------- -- 敵取得タイプB（先攻型）
------------------------------------------- function GetMyEnemyB ( myid ) local result = 0 -- 敵のキャラク ターid local owner = GetV ( V_OWNER , myid ) -- 主人自身のキャラクターid local actors = GetActors ( ) -- 周りのキャラクターidを全部取得 local enemys = {} -- 敵のリスト local index = 1 -- インデックス番号( 初期 値 1 ) local type -- ( 未使用 ) -- ( 1 , actors [ 1 ] ) 、( 2, actors [ 2 ] ) 、…のペアを繰り返す -- 周りのキャラクターidをひとつひとつチェックして、そのキャラクターが -- モンスターだったら、敵として敵リストに追加する for i , v in ipairs ( actors ) do if ( v ~= owner and v ~= myid ) then -- 主人かホム自身じゃなければ if ( 1 == IsMonster ( v ) ) then -- モンスターだったら enemys [ index ] = v -- 敵のリストに追加 index = index+1 -- インデックス を1増やす end end end local min_dis = 100 -- 最小距 離( 初期値 は100 ) local dis -- 距離 -- ( 1,enemys [ 1 ] ) 、( 2, enemys [ 2 ] ) 、…のペアを繰り返す -- 敵リストの中で、ホムから一番近い敵をホムの攻撃対象とする for i , v in ipairs ( enemys ) do dis = GetDistance2 ( myid , v) -- ホムと敵との距離を取得 if ( dis < min_dis ) then -- 最小距離より近ければ result = v -- その敵をターゲットとする min_dis = dis -- その敵との距離を最小距離とする end end return result end
上のように待機状態を処理するプログラムを作成しました。
待機状態から変化されるアルケミスト追従状態、ターゲット追跡状態も似たやり方で作成し、残りの状態も同じです。
最後にホムンクルスが使用者の直接的なコマンドを遂行するようにすることがあります。
マウスで特定位置に移動させるとか特定モンスターを攻撃させるとか、
キーボードの特定ジャンキーを押してその場所でばかりじっとしているようにするとかの処理です。
使用者が出すコマンドはメッセージ形態でスクリプトに伝達します。
そのメッセージを解釈して、特定コマンドを遂行する状態に変化させれば良いです。
そうしたいならメッセージを受けて解釈する部分と特定コマンドを処理する状態を追加して
状態処理関数を追加すれば良いです。AI( myid ) 導入部に次を追加します。
MyID = myid -- ホム自身のキャラクターid local msg = GetMsg ( myid ) -- 主人が入力したコマンド local rmsg = GetResMsg ( myid ) -- 先行入力されたコマンド -- コマンドごとの振り分け処理 if msg [ 1 ] == NONE_CMD then -- 新規コマンド入力がなければ if rmsg [ 1 ]
~= NONE_CMD then -- 先行入力されたコマンドがあれば if List.size( ResCmdList ) < 10 then -- 先行入力コマンドが10個未満ならば List.pushright ( ResCmdList , rmsg ) -- 先行入力コマンドリストに追加 end end else -- 新規コマンド入力があれば List.clear ( ResCmdList ) -- 先行入力コマンドリストをクリア ProcessCommand ( msg ) -- ホムのステータスを更新する end
メッセージを処理する ProcessCommand ( msg ) は
各メッセージ処理関数 OnMOVE_CMD ( msg [ 2 ] , msg [ 3 ] ) などを追加して 、
それぞれのコマンド遂行状態処理関数 ( 例えば OnMOVE_CMD_ST
( ) ) も作成します 。
コマンド遂行状態が必要な理由はコマンド遂行が終わるまで
コマンド遂行完了を検査するためです。
function OnCHASE_ST () TraceAI ( " OnCHASE_ST " ) if ( true == IsOutOfSight ( MyID , MyEnemy ) ) then -- 敵が視界外に出たならば MyState = IDLE_ST -- ホム状態を待機状態にする MyEnemy = 0 -- タゲにしている敵がいたらタゲ解除 MyDestX , MyDestY = 0,0 -- 目標座標があればクリア TraceAI ( " CHASE_ST -> IDLE_ST : ENEMY_OUTSIGHT_IN " ) return end if ( true == IsInAttackSight ( MyID , MyEnemy ) ) then -- 敵が攻撃範囲に入ったら MyState = ATTACK_ST -- ホム状態を攻撃状態にする TraceAI ( " CHASE_ST -> ATTACK_ST : ENEMY_INATTACKSIGHT_IN " ) return end local x , y = GetV ( V_POSITION , MyEnemy ) -- 敵の座標を取得する if ( MyDestX ~= x or MyDestY ~= y ) then -- 目標座標に敵がいなければ MyDestX , MyDestY = GetV ( V_POSITION , MyEnemy ) ; -- 敵の座標を目標座標にする Move ( MyID , MyDestX , MyDestY ) -- 敵の座標へ移動開始 TraceAI ( " CHASE_ST -> CHASE_ST : DESTCHANGED_IN " ) return end end
上のような特定状態処理関数で、知りたい内容を
TraceAI に入れてくれます 。
そしてゲームチャットウィンドウに / traceai と打てばラグナロクオンラインがインストールされたフォルダに
ある TraceAI.txt ファイルにその内容が記録されます。
再び / traceai を入力すれば記録を止めます。色々な変数値を記録したい時は
string.format を利用して文字列を操作します。

A team of researchers working with colleagues from the Botswana National Museum shed new light on the questions of when cattle were brought to southern Africa and from where .
A domestic cow bone , dated to about 2000 years ago was excavated from a site at Toteng , located in the Kalahari Desert of northern Botswana .
This bone , dated by the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry ( AMS ) radiocarbon technique , provides the oldest directly dated evidence of cattle in southern Africa .
Domestic sheep were also present at Toteng at about the same time .
Historical and linguistic information suggest northern Botswana figured prominently in the arrival and dispersal of livestock in southern Africa .
The new dates support this view and confirm a long - term association between people and livestock in this part of the Kalahari .
The discovery of the 2000 year old cow and sheep bones are important because of the long held view that the Kalahari was a comparatively isolated area that was primarily occupied by foraging peoples until recently .
The findings , to be published in the August / October issue of Current Anthropology , are also interesting in the broader context of the spread of domestic livestock throughout Africa .
Whereas livestock had spread into northern Kenya in East Africa by as early as 4000 / 4500 years ago , it took an additional 2000 years for their eventual spread into southern Africa .
Experts have stressed that this delay was largely due to the presence of tripanosomiasis , carried by tsetse flies , as well as other diseases that kill livestock in much of the intervening area .
The Toteng sites are situated near the southern edge of the Tsetse fly zone and the new dates of about 2000 years ago appear to date the initial penetration of livestock through this zone .

Lainey ’s gossip points out that Lindsay Lohan ’s pupils are pinpoints in these recent pictures of her at the Malibu Celebration of Film Dinner on October 7th .
I would say it ’s the effect of the flashbulbs , but her eyes are like this in every single picture and she looks completely looped .
Lainey says that if Lohan drops a lot of weight quickly now you can probably guess how she did it :
She has beautiful eyes , non ?
Two expressive pools of green / grey / blue accentuated even further by super dark locks and a curiously small pair of pupils .
But only a coincidence … right ?
With all that talk of Rachel Zoe and crystal meth and providing more than just style advice for her star clients and given that some idiots in the press have called Lilo bloated of late – the fact that her pupils are pinned is really * just * a coincidence , right ?
She wo n’t be 5 - 10 pounds lighter in 5 days , right ?
A new lab experiment – keep watching , as will I .
According to MentalHelp.net , physical signs of drug abuse include :
It 's the development cycle !
What exactly do I mean by development cycle .
This is the time it takes from the point a code edit is completed to when the developer can see the results of the change .
This could be through a unit test , hitting a break point in a debugger , or manually checking the results .
Why is this so important ?
Way back in the early 90's I was fortunate enough to spend some time at AT&T Bell labs .
I was amazed when I was looking through the company directory and there was " Ritchie " .
Yes , that Ritchie , Dennis M. Ritchie one of the authors of " Programming in C " .
Possibly the best programming book ever written .
I never did meet Dennis .
There were also some very interesting people on my team .
One of my team members was a tester on one of the first releases of Unix .
We were chatting about the first computers we worked on .
He had me beat .
He mumbled something about punch cards and then he said something that has stuck with me over all of these years .
" compilers are better at reading code than developers . "
While this may seem obvious and somewhat trivial .
If you really think about the implications of this simple fact ; it will change how you look at development .
One of the obvious implications is that the compiler will detect a syntax problem long before a developer will .
The time it takes to compile has been reduced by performance increases over the years .
Now , this implication is relatively moot with background compilation .
At least for some languages and environments .
However there is another implication .
When I first started writing code .
I was n't actually writing it .
I was typing it in from listings in magazines and books .
I was learning to code .
After typing in hundreds of programs I got better at typing and catching errors in transcription .
Eventually I even found errors in the code in the actual listings .
One of the skills that improved dramatically was my ability to spot the problem area and the actual problem .
I became very proficient at finding errors .
This was important because it took so long to edit and compile a program .
If I guessed wrong there was a large penalty in time before I could try something else .
The development cycle was a long one .
Time was better spent double and triple checking your code than watching a build .
This has changed over the years .
We as developers gain performance and then it is taken away ( this may be a topic for another post ) .
This can still be an important skill on large projects .
There is no better way to lower your productivity than to make a typo when you are in a long development cycle .
On small projects it is more efficient to just run it .
That old axiom still holds true .
The important point that can be derived is that the development cycle should be as short as possible because the compiler is better at finding syntax errors , and test cases and debuggers are better at finding logic errors .
A development cycle is the time it takes to make a code change to the time the developer can see the results .
This cycle determines how many changes a developer can make in a coding session .
The shorter the development cycle the more changes a developer can make .
The more changes a developer can make the closer they can get to making the code work correctly in a given amount of time .
Another advantage to a short development cycle has to do with something sometimes referred to as the " zone " .
Being in the zone is when a programmer is completely immersed in development and performing at the best of their ability .
Long development cycles have longer periods of time where a developer is waiting to see the results .
This can lead to distractions that can take a developer out of the zone .
After a fifteen minute build I am almost always out of the zone .
I usually try to get back in the zone by saying to myself , " Now where was I ? "
A short development cycle does increase developer productivity .
The development cycle has some other components as well .
The amount of source code plays a role not only in compilation times , but also in edit times .
It takes a longer amount of time to locate the code that needs to be edited in a big program than in a small one .
The deployment environment also plays a role .
If the program must be deployed or published this adds to the development cycle .
This is especially true of web server applications where the server must be restarted .
That extra minute can cut productivity in half .
Let me say that again in more specific terms .
Developing an application that needs to be deployed to IIS or JBOSS will cut programmer productivity in half .
Certain languages and development environments have become extremely popular .
Let 's look at the often loathed Visual Basic first .
Let me state outright ; I like VB .
I heard a collective groan .
True it has many short comings .
It does n't do X , Y and Z .
So why was it so damn popular ?
I 'll share why I think it was so popular .
I have written code in many , many languages on many platforms .
VB had at one point the shortest possible development cycle .
The ability to almost instantly run a program and edit the code in the debugger does wonders for the development cycle and programmer productivity .
I believe this was one of the key reasons VB enjoyed the success it achieved .
The other being the simplicity of the development model especially in regards to database development and the windows event model .
This also has a lot to do with why ruby and ruby on rails is so popular .
The same goes for python .
I think the languages themselves although concise are secondary to the short development cycle .
Java on the other hand typically has a long development cycle for web development compared to ruby on rails .
Why it matters .
It matters because the development cycle impacts productivity .
It impacts how long a piece of functionality will take to build .
So estimates need to take into consideration the length of the development cycle .
Developers should look at their development cycle and optimize it as best they can within the constraints of their environment .

KHB : A Filesystems reading list
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
We 've all been there - you 're wandering around a party at some Linux event clutching your drink and looking for someone to talk to , but everyone is having some obscure technical conversation full of unfamiliar jargon .
Then , as you slide past a cluster of important - looking people , you overhear the word " superblock " and think , " Superblock , that 's a file system thing ...
I read about file systems in operating systems class once . "
Gratefully , you join the conversation , only to discover while you know some of the terms - cylinder group , indirect block , inode - you 're still unable to come up with stunning ripostes like , " Aha , but that 's really just another version of soft updates , and it does n't solve the nlinks problem . "
( Admiring silence ensues . )
Now what ?
You want to be able to make witty remarks about the pros and cons of journaling while throwing back the last of your martini , but you do n't know where to start .
Fortunately , you can get a decent grasp of modern file systems without reading a whole book on file systems .
( I have n't yet read a book on file systems I would recommend , anyway . )
After reading these file systems papers ( or at least their abstracts ) , you 'll be able to at least fake a working knowledge of file systems - as long as everyone is drinking and it's too loud to hear anyone clearly .
Enjoy !
The Basics
These papers are oldies but goodies .
While the systems they describe are fairly obsolete and have been heavily improved since these initial descriptions , they make a good introduction to file systems structure and terminology .
A Fast File System for UNIX by Marshall Kirk McKusick , William Joy , Samuel Leffler and Robert Fabry .
This paper describes the first version of the original UNIX file system that was suitable for production use .
It became known as FFS ( Fast File System ) or UFS ( UNIX File System ) .
The " fast " part of the name comes from the fact that the original UNIX file system maxed out at about 5 % of disk bandwidth , whereas the first iteration of FFS could use about 50 % - a huge improvement .
This paper is absolutely foundational , as the majority of production UNIX file systems are FFS - style file systems .
While some parts of this paper are obsolete ( check out the section on rotational delay ) , it 's a simple , readable explanation of basic file system architecture that you can refer back to time and again .
Also , it 's pretty fun to read a paper describing the first implementation of , for example , symbolic links for a UNIX file system .
For extra credit , you can read the original file system checker paper , Fsck - the UNIX file system check program , by Marshall Kirk McKusick and T. J. Kowalski .
It describes the major issues in checking and repairing file system metadata consistency .
Improving fsck is a hot topic in file systems right now , so reading this paper might be worthwhile .
Vnodes : An Architecture for Multiple File System Types in Sun UNIX by Steve Kleiman .
The original UNIX file system interface had been designed to support exactly one kind of file system .
With the advent of FFS and other file systems , operating systems now needed to support several different file systems .
Several solutions were proposed , but the dominant solution ended up being the VFS ( Virtual File System ) interface , first proposed and implemented by Sun .
This paper explains the rationale behind VFS and vnodes .
Design and Implementation of the Sun Network Filesystem by Russel Sandberg , David Goldberg , Steve Kleiman , Dan Walsh , and Bob Lyon .
Once upon a time ( 1985 , specifically ) , people were n't really clear on why you would want a network file system ( as opposed to , for example , a network disk or copying around files via rcp ) .
This paper explains the needs and requirements that resulted in the invention of NFS , the network file system everyone loves to hate but uses all the time anyway .
It also discusses the design of the VFS .
A fun quote from the paper : " One of the advantages of the NFS was immediately obvious : as the df output below shows , a diskless workstation can have access to more than a Gigabyte of disk ! "
Slaying the fsck dragon
One of the major problems in file systems is keeping the on - disk data consistent in the event that a file system is interrupted in the middle of update ( for example , if the system loses power ) .
Original FFS solved this problem by running fsck on the file system after a crash or other unclean unmount , but this took a really long time and could lose data .
Many smart people thought about this problem and came up with four major approaches : journaling , log - structured file systems , soft updates , and copy - on - write .
Each method provided a way of quickly recovering the file system after a crash .
The most popular approach was journaling , since it was both relatively simple and easy to " bolt - on " to existing FFS - style file systems .
Journaling file systems solve the fsck problem by first writing an entry describing an update to the file system to a on - disk journal - a record of file system operations .
Once the journal entry is complete , the main file system is updated ; if the operation is interrupted , the journal entry is replayed on the next mount , completing any half - finished operations in progress at the time of the crash .
Most production file systems ( including ext3 , XFS , VxFS , logging UFS , and reiserfs ) use journaling to avoid fsck after a crash .
No canonical journaling paper exists outside the database literature ( from whence the idea was lifted wholesale ) , but Journaling the Linux ext2fs Filesystem by Stephen Tweedie is a good choice for learning both journaling techniques in general and the details of ext3 in particular .
The Design and Implementation of a Log-Structured File System by Mendel Rosenblum and John K. Ousterhout .
Journaling file systems have to write each operation to disk twice : once in the log , and once in the final location .
What would happen if we only wrote the data to disk once - in the journal ?
While the log - structured architecture was an electrifying new idea , it ultimately turned out to be impractical for production use , despite the concerted efforts of many computer science researchers .
Today , no major production file system is log -structured .
( Note that a log - structured file system is not the same as a logging file system - logging is another name for journaling . )
If you 're looking for cocktail party gossip , Margot Seltzer and several colleagues published papers critiquing and comparing log - structured file systems to variations of FFS - style file systems , in which LFS usually came out rather the worse for the wear .
This led to a semi- famous flame war in the form of web pages , archived here .
Soft Updates : A Technique for Eliminating Most Synchronous Writes in the Fast Filesystem by Marshall Kirk McKusick and Greg Ganger .
Soft updates carefully orders writes to a file system such that in the event of a crash , the only inconsistencies are relatively harmless ones - leaked blocks and inodes .
After a crash , the file system is mounted immediately and fsck runs in the background .
The performance of soft updates is excellent , but the complexity is very high - as in , soft updates has been implemented only once ( on BSD ) to my knowledge .
Personally , it took me about 5 years to thoroughly understand soft updates and I have n't met anyone other than the authors who claimed to understand it well enough to implement it .
The paper is pretty understandable up to about page 5 , at which point your head will explode .
Do n't feel bad about this , it happens to everyone .
File System Design for an NFS File Server Appliance by Dave Hitz , James Lau , and Michael Malcom .
This paper describes the file system used inside NetApp file servers , Write - Anywhere File Layout ( WAFL ) , as of 1994 ( it 's been improved in many ways since then ) .
WAFL was the first major use of a copy - on - write file system - one in which " live " ( in use ) metadata is never overwritten in place but copied elsewhere on disk .
Once a consistent set of updates has been written to disk , the " superblock " is re-written to point to the new set of metadata .
Copy - on - write has an interesting set of trade - offs all its own , but has been implemented in a production file system twice now ; Solaris 's ZFS is also a copy - on - write file system .
File system performance
Each of these papers focuses on file system performance , but also introduces more than one interesting idea and makes a good starting point for exploring several areas of file system design and implementation .
Extent - like Performance from a UNIX File System by Larry McVoy and Steve Kleiman .
This 1991 paper describes optimizations to FFS that doubled file system bandwidth for sequential I /O workloads .
While the optimizations described in this paper are considered old hat these days ( ever heard of readahead ? ) , it 's a good introduction to file system performance .
Sidebar :
Where are they now ?
You might have recognized some of the names in the author lists of the papers in this article - and chances are , you are n't recognizing their names because of their file system work .
What else did these people do ?
Here 's a totally non-scientific selection .
Bill Joy - co-founded Sun Microsystems
Larry McVoy - wrote BitKeeper , co-founded BitMover
Steve Kleiman - CTO , Network Appliance
Mendel Rosenblum - co-founder , VMWare
John Ousterhout - wrote Tcl / Tk , co-founded several companies
Margot Seltzer - co-founder , Sleepycat Software
Dave Hitz - co-founder , Network Appliance Obviously , anyone wanting to found a successful company and make millions of dollars should consider writing a file system first .
Scalability in the XFS File System by Adam Sweeney , Doug Doucette , Wei Hu , Curtis Anderson , Mike Nishimoto , and Geoff Peck .
This paper describes the motivation and implementation of XFS , a 64 - bit file system using extents , B+ trees , dynamically allocated inodes , and journaling .
XFS is not by any means an FFS - style file system and reading this paper will give you the basics on most extent - based file systems .
It also describes quite a few useful optimizations for avoiding fragmentation , scaling to multiple threads , and the like .
The Utility of File Names by Daniel Ellard , Jonathan Ledlie , and Margot Seltzer .
File system performance and on - disk layout can be vastly improved if the file system can predict ( with reasonable accuracy ) the size and access pattern of a file before it writes it to disk .
The obvious solution is to add a new set of file system interfaces allowing the application to give explicit hints about the size and properties of a new file .
Unfortunately , the history of file systems is littered with unused per-file interfaces like this ( how often do you set the noatime flag on a file ? ) .
However , it turns out that applications are already giving these hints - in the form of file names , permissions , and other per-file properties .
This paper is the first in a series demonstrating that a file system can make useful predictions about the future of a file based on the file name and other properties .

Thanks to Nikita Danilov , Zach Brown , and Kristen Accardi for paper suggestions and encouragement to write this article .
Thanks to Theodore Y . Ts'o for actually saying something very similar to the stunning riposte in the first paragraph ( which was , by the way , a completely accurate and very incisive criticism of what I was working on at the moment ) .
New computerized registration rolls and litigation over new voter identification laws in states like Arizona , Georgia , Indiana and Missouri have left many poll workers and voters unclear about the rules , including whether they are in effect , as the courts have blocked many of the new laws .
“ We ’re expecting arguments at the polls in these states that will slow everything down and probably cause large numbers of legitimate voters to be turned away or to be forced to vote on provisional ballots , ” said Barbara Burt , an elections reform director for Common Cause .
Meanwhile , votes in about half of the 45 most competitive Congressional races , including contests in Florida , Georgia and Indiana , will be cast on electronic machines that provide no independent means of verification .
“ In a close race , a machine error in one precinct could leave the results in doubt and the losing candidates wo n’t be able to get a recount , ” said Warren Stewart , policy director for VoteTrustUSA , an advocacy group that has criticized electronic voting .
Deborah L. Markowitz , president of the National Association of Secretaries of State , was less inclined to sound the alarm .
She said that since it was not a presidential election year and many states had encouraged voting by mail , fewer people would turn up at the polls than in 2004 .
With computerized registration rolls , Ms. Markowitz said , there will be far fewer people incorrectly excluded from the new databases compared with when registration rolls were on paper .
“ There will be isolated incidents , there is no doubt about that , ” she said .
“ But over all the system will move faster and with fewer problems . ”
Rev Kyle Lake , 33 , was standing in a small pool used for baptisms at the University Baptist Church when he was electrocuted on Sunday morning .
Rev
Lake reached out to adjust a nearby microphone , which produced an electric shock , said church pastor Ben Dudley .
Rev Lake , who had a wife and three children , had been at the church for nine years .
Confusion
He was taken by ambulance to a local medical centre where he was pronounced dead .
The woman being baptised apparently had not stepped into the water , Mr Dudley told the Waco Tribune - Herald .
She was taken to the hospital as a precaution , but was not seriously injured , he said .
" At first , there was definitely confusion just because everyone was trying to figure out what was going on , " Mr Dudley said .
" Everyone just immediately started praying . "
At a remembrance attended by about 1,000 people on Sunday night , Mr Dudley said the congregation would move forward as a church .
" I do n't know how , when , why , where or what 's going to happen , but we will continue as a church in the community because that is what Kyle would have wanted , " he said .
PARIS Hilton ’s haunches or Jessica Biel ’s butt ?
City women are flocking to plastic surgeons in search of a booty befitting their favorite starlet .
At one new Upper East Side clinic , posterior patients can request a specific celebrity ’s backside .
Popular requests include Eva Longoria , Lindsay Lohan , Jessica Simpson , Paris Hilton and Jessica Biel .
Noticeably absent from the list is a certain Bronx - born booty bombshell , Jennifer Lopez .
The new rear to bear is smaller , tighter and “ more refined , ” according to Dr. Brad Jacobs , who ’s unveiling his “ Star Butts ” clinic today in his office .
Surgeons re-create famous fannies by transferring patients ’ unwanted belly flab or saddlebags to their bottoms .
Dr. Jacobs said he can turn even the flattest rump into a celebworthy humps with a little help from your extra padding and about $ 11,000 .
“ It ’s your own fat , and it ’s in the best soil [ your butt ] , so it lasts , ” said Jacobs .
“ The added bonus is they ’re getting liposuction to get the excess fat and put it where you need it , ” he said .
American Society of Plastic Surgeons statistics show that butt lifts have increased dramatically , up 283 percent from 2000 to 2005 .
Business is certainly booming at some Big Apple offices .
“ We ’re doing four , maybe five a week on a busy week , ” said George Lefkovits , of Manhattan .
“ It ’s now become one of our key operations in the office .
“ You can do this on a Thursday or a Friday and be back to work on Monday , ” Lefkovits said .
Some complications can include infection , lumpiness and unevenness .
Critics also contend that the fat does n’t stay in the posterior for long , and most people will need to be retouched as time passes .
Carla Murino , a new bride from Staten Island , has had her new bottom for a year and is loving every curve of it .
“ I did n’t want to look like JLo , ” said Murino , a patient of Jacobs .
“ It ’s more like I wanted an athletic butt – nice , little and perky . ”
And that ’s what she said she got over a year ago when she fat removed from her stomach to her bottom .
“ It ’s great , ” she said .
“ I put on yoga pants and its like , I have a butt ! ”
Rump change
If you do n’t have a bazillion dollars to resculpt your rear , here are some other , cheaper bum optimizers .
* The squat –
The single best exercise for strengthening , toning and shaping the butt .
Just stand with your feet shoulder - width apart , bend at the knees until you ’re parallel to the floor , push through your heels , contracting your bum .
Repeat .
* Padding –
If you lack rear assets , the Better Bottom ( $ 39 ) is a panty with padding to resemble a realistic round bottom .
If you ’ve got enough padding of your own , but want a more contoured shape , try the Booty Booster ( $ 16 ; both available at lovefifi.com ) .
* Clarins Total Body Lift –
This is the cellulite - reducing cream everyone says actually works .
Aromatic plant and caffeine extracts help decrease fat storage , improve circulation and firm the skin .
Apply twice a day ( $ 57 ; available anywhere Clarins is sold ) .

ACTUALLY , this is good , ” my editor said when my book got panned .
“ It ’s a long review by a well - known person .
It ’s on a good page .
It ’s even got a caricature of you . ”
True , the drawing made me look like a demented chicken — a fat demented chicken — but as he explained , art meant space and space meant respect and respect meant attention .
As my former husband put it , quoting Dr. Johnson as is his wont , “ I would rather be attacked than unnoticed . ”
Even in the 18th century , it seems , there was no such thing as bad publicity .
Unless , of course , it ’s your own .
In the days that followed , I discovered something interesting about my writer friends .
Here I had thought of them as anxious and sensitive , taking to their beds , or the phone , or both , when professional setbacks came their way .
How often had I had the conversation about the culture editor with a grudge dating back to the reign of Tiberius , the clueless reviewer , the publicist who stops returning your phone calls and the publisher who suggests you consider another line of work ?
But that was them .
My bad review was something else again : my writer friends thought it was great .
It was an opportunity , a platform , a megaphone , a lemon about to be transmuted into the most ambrosial lemonade .
The very things that made it bad made it good : its frivolity displayed my depth , its confusion threw into relief my steely logic , its snark showed all too clearly who the real wit was .
Lost at sea since October , the three fishermen from a hamlet outside San Blas were given up for dead long ago .
After weeks of looking for their son at fishing ports up and down the Pacific Coast of Mexico , the parents of Salvador “ Chava ” Ordonez resigned themselves to the belief that he , his two companions and their 30 - foot fishing boat had been swallowed up by the sea , family members said .
On Tuesday , news of a miracle came from 5,000 miles away .
After more than nine months adrift , Ordonez and his companions had been found alive north of Baker Island in the central Pacific , the lonely stretch of ocean where aviator Amelia Earhart disappeared almost 70 years ago .
Sunburned and skinny , but otherwise healthy , they were rescued Aug. 9 by the crew of the Koo ’s 102 , a Marshall Islands fishing boat run by a Taiwanese crew .

Trade winds and ocean currents had carried the three men from the waters off their home state of Nayarit more than halfway to Australia .
“ They were quite hungry , ” Eugene Muller , manager of Koo ’s Fishing Co. , said in a telephone interview from the Marshall Islands .
“ It ’s a long ways from Mexico to here . ”
The Mexicans ’ fishing boat had two disabled outboard motors but was still seaworthy , Muller said .
Interviewed Tuesday evening via shipboard radio by Mexican television , the men said they survived by eating raw fish and capturing seabirds .

“ Sometimes our stomachs would hurt , because we would go up to 15 days without eating , ” Jesus Eduardo Vidana told the Televisa network .
“ There were times when we had only one bird to share among the three of us . ”
The three fishermen apparently had no radio or cellphone , relatives said .
But they carried several days ’ worth of water and food , including a supply of lemons .
The three men are in their mid-20s and their youth may have played a factor in their survival , their relatives speculated .
Aboard the Koo ’s 102 , the fishermen told their rescuers that they had fought off dehydration by collecting rainwater to drink .

“ They were quite skinny ” Muller said .
“ As soon as we got them on board , the crew fed them some rice . ”
Ordonez , Vidana and Lucio Rendon Becerra left the fishing hamlet of El Limon , about 425 miles northwest of Mexico City , on Oct. 28 , for what was to have been two or three weeks of deep - sea fishing , relatives said .
Vidana told Televisa that strong winds pushed them out of their fishing area and they became lost .
Some family members already had said a mourning novena , ritual prayers that are meant to guide the departed on their journey from purgatory to heaven .

On Tuesday , news of the rescue was greeted in El Limon and San Blas as nothing less than an act of God .
“ I ’m trembling all over and I think I ’m going to have a heart attack , ” Saul Ordonez , 42 , a cousin of two of the fishermen , said by telephone from El Limon .
“ They went fishing and they never came back .
We thought they were dead . ”
Saul Ordonez and other fishermen from the hamlets around San Blas had sailed and traveled up and down the Pacific Coast looking for traces of the missing boat .
They even searched the coast of the Islas Marias , more than 50 miles off Nayarit .
“ We were looking for some trace of them , anything , but we found nothing , ” Ordonez said .
Other family members visited Acapulco and Mazatlan , and called authorities as far away as Colombia .

“ No one gave us any information , no one gave us any news , ” Hortensia Ordonez , Salvador ’s aunt , told a Mexico City radio station .
“ So we gave them up for lost . ”
Unbeknown to their relatives in San Blas and El Limon , their fishing boat was being pushed westward by the same currents and winds that had carried Portuguese and Spanish explorers across the Pacific centuries ago .
Those currents often play havoc with the fishermen of San Blas , many of whom go 50 miles or more out to sea in search of shark and other deep - sea fish .
Saul Ordonez has another cousin who has been missing for more than seven years .
“ When you ’re out there , your engine is your lifeline , ” Saul Ordonez said .
“ These days some of us carry cellphones so we can call back if an engine fails . ”

The three fishermen remain aboard the Koo ’s 102 , whose crew is fishing for tuna between the Marshall Islands and Kiribati , Muller said .
The Koo ’s 102 is scheduled to arrive in the port of Majuro in the Marshall Islands in 10 to 14 days , officials said .
The ship ’s crew members are mostly Chinese - speaking workers , and the Mexicans have been able to communicate very little with their rescuers .
They wrote their names on a sheet of paper , which was faxed from the ship to Majuro , Muller said .

Rendon told Mexican television that the tuna fishermen had spotted their disabled vessel .
“ We were born again , ” Rendon said of being rescued .
“ This has been a miracle from God because we never lost hope . ”
Mexican diplomats said Tuesday that they would arrange a plane trip home for the men once they reached port .
Remigio Rendon , 43 , said his family never gave up hope that his nephew Lucio would be found alive .

“ My mother refused to pray the novena for him , ” Rendon said .
“ She said Lucio was still alive .
And she was right . ”
Basics of Tien Len
Tien Len is a prominent card game which originated in Vietnam .
It is played by people of any ages in the Vietnamese neighborhood all over the world .
Item of The Game Tien Len
The object of the video game is to be the first gamer to throw out all your cards .
Just How to Play Tien Len
This is a relatively easy game to find out but takes time to master .
You can play this video game with 2 to 4 gamers yet like most games , the a lot more gamers , the even more enjoyable it is .
Each gamer is dealt 13 cards from a typical 52 card deck .
No jokers are used .
The individual with the 3 of spades begins play .
This person should dispose of the 3 of spades in some way .
The 3 of spades is the smallest card in placing for danh bai tien len
The play relocates clockwise .
If you ’re the very first person to play your hand then you can pick to play a solitary card or play a set .
If you ’re not the first individual to play after that you have to follow what the previous person played .
As an example , if the previous person played a set then you additionally need to play the exact same collection if you have a greater set .
The collections are described below .
Since the item of the video game is to dispose of all your cards after that you need to play as lots of cards as you can on your turn .
If you have the 3 of spades in addition to 4,5,6,7 of any collection , after that you must play a set of 3,4,5,6,7 instead of putting down just the 3 .
Play after that moves to the person on the left .
If he or she does not have a 5 card straight after that he needs to pass his turn .
If he does have a 5 card straight after that he has the alternative to pass also .
Why would he pass ?
He would pass if his 5 card straight is part of a 10 card straight and also he wants to maintain his 10 card straight together .
Play continues for this round .
The individual with the highest set for the round reaches start the following round with any kind of cards that he wants .
Currently suppose 2 players have the exact same set .
This is where we get into the positions of the suites .
Rankings go from spade , then club , then ruby , after that heart .
So spade is the smallest and also heart is the biggest .
3 is the most affordable card and also A is the 2nd greatest card .
The highest card in Tien len is therefore the 2 of hearts .
The deuce of hearts is also called the pig or “ con heo ” .
If you are dealt 4 deuces you have the best hand and are instantly a winner without having fun .
That hand is just also solid .
Sets in Tien Len .
Pair
3 of a kind
4 of a kind
3 card straight and greater
3 successive sets or more
There are no such things as a capacity or flush .
What Makes This Game That Extra Intriguing …
What makes Tien Len so fascinating is the capacity to “ slice ” somebody .
Whenever a person lays down a deucse of any kind of collection , you can defeat their hand if you have either a 4 of a kind or 3 successive pairs or greater .
Let ’s state somebody lays down a 2 of spade .
I after that set 33,44,55 to defeat their hand and gain the ability to begin the next round .
However , if someone sets a 4 of a kind , they can defeat my 3 consecutive sets and also they begin the following round instead .
4 of a kind defeats consecutive pairs so the best hand is to have 4
Aces if you intend to slice .
In live games where you bet cash , if you slice someone , you get extra money over what you would obtain if you win the video game .
I will not get into that much below as you have various other things to discover first .
There is one roadblock to chopping somebody nevertheless that you need to understand .
That is whenever you pass a hand either since you do n’t have a greater card to play or because you ’re holding your cards for one more round , then you can not play that hand the next time your turn happens .
You need to await the following round .
For example , the individual to your right plays a 4 .
You decide to pass because there are cards in your hand which belong to a set and also you do n’t want to take a card from your set and break the set .
The person to your left plays a 6 and also the next individual plays a King .
The individual to your today plays a 2 of hearts which is the highest heart .
You can chop he or she by laying down your 88,99,10 yet the guidelines forbid you to do this because you had actually handed down your turn formerly .
It coincides round that you passed so you have to wait till the next round .
Constantly reassess if passing is the right decision when you have a cutting hand .
Otherwise you ’ll be stuck to a slicing hand that is not playable .
It ’s quite unpleasant if somebody factors that out .
Strategy For Winning at Tien Len
The much better you are at discovering which cards have actually been played and also by whom , the better you will certainly go to Tien Len .
For example , if you have a deuce of diamonds , its a really high card yet there is one card that can beat that card .
You can wait up until somebody plays the greater card than your own ( the 2 of hearts ) then play your card to guarantee that your card is the winning card for that round .
You do n’t intend to lose your highest cards by playing them and then obtaining defeated by higher cards or sets of cards .
If you have the possibility to begin a round then play your cheapest solitary cards initially to eliminate them .
If you have a lot of reduced single cards or “ trash ” cards then your opportunities of winning are near impossible .
Tien Len like Casino poker is a video game that relies on exactly how excellent your hand is yet also just how you play your hand .
Select your cards to play carefully as well as you ’ll appear in advance .

New digital camera ?
Know how , where you can use it Digital cameras were one of the hot gifts these holidays — the first one for some people , an upgrade for others .
Cell - phone cameras are everywhere too , and sites like Flickr and Buzznet — not to mention photoblogs — make it easy for anyone to share the zillions of photos they 're taking .
With all these cameras snapping around us , I started to wonder about the laws regarding using them .
Where can you shoot ?
What can you shoot ?
A blogger I know shot a picture in an office building .
One of the tenants had boxes of medical records sitting around in an unlocked office , visible from the hall .
He published a picture of the boxes , which started a little brouhaha :
He did n't have permission from the building 's landlord , someone said , so he was n't allowed to take or publish the photos .
That turns out not to be the case .
What I discovered is that a lot of people have ideas — often very clear ones — of what is legal and what is n't , based on anything from common sense to wishful thinking to " I always heard … "
Gadget of the week Starting here , I 'll be featuring one new , cool tech toy every week .
This week , in keeping with the column topic , let me introduce you to the five megapixel Casio Exilim EX - S500 digital camera ( $ 350 ) .
I started getting into the habit of carrying a camera with me most of the time .
( You never know what you might see . )
When the Casio folks sent me this to try out for a couple of weeks , I decided I had found a perfect slip - in - your - pocket shooter .
This is n't the camera to get if you 're looking to have full control and take the best pictures available with a digicam .
It is the camera to get if you want to carry something around to get really nice shots quickly and easily from something that slips into a shirt pocket .
It 's designed to be quick and convenient .
It 's got a great full - auto mode , as well as a host of presets ( Portrait , Scenery , Sports , etc. ) .
There 's no optical viewfinder , just a large , bright LCD .
It 's quick to start up , has an almost no shutter lag , and sports an anti-shake technology , a bright flash , and even shoots 30 fps MPEG - 4 movies .
Its strength is its size : Tiny and slim , about the size of a credit card and less than half an inch thick .
I love my Canon Digital Rebel XT , but this is the one I grab when I 'm walking downtown for lunch  just in case .
The biggest downside is the tiny built in memory ; it will allow you three shots at the highest quality .
Plan on spending an extra $ 50 or $ 60 for a 512 - MG SD memory card ; Casio should have included one with the Exilim , especially because it takes such nice movies .
Other than that , if you 're feeling nosy or just want to shoot unobtrusively , check this puppy out .
Trouble is , they are n't always right .
If you 've got a digital camera and like to shoot in public , it pays to know the real deal .
So I went looking for it .
I checked with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and found its Photographers ' Guide to Privacy .
The Missouri Bar has a terrific Journalists ' Right of Privacy Primer by attorney Mark Sableman .
Bert P. Krages , an attorney in Portland , Ore. , and author of the Legal Handbook for Photographers , has a short but excellent PDF document called The Photographer 's Right .
I also had e-mail conversations with both Mssrs. Sableman and Krages ( who were both careful to point out that they were only speaking in general terms , and not offering legal advice ) .
Finally , I got some background from the American Law Institute 's A Concise Restatement of Torts on the Harvard Law website .
Of course , I 'm not a lawyer ; in this case I 'm a researcher .
But lemme tell you :
All these sources jibed , which I take to be a good sign .
Just do n't take this as legal advice ; it 's one columnist 's researched understanding of the law .
If you can see it , you can shoot it Let 's get the easy stuff out of the way .
Aside from sensitive government buildings ( e.g. , military bases ) , if you 're on public property you can photograph anything you like , including private property .
There are some limits — using a zoom lens to shoot someone who has a reasonable expectation of privacy is n't covered — but no one can come charging out of a business and tell you not to take photos of the building , period .
Further , they cannot demand your camera or your digital media or film .
Well , they can demand it , but you are under no obligation to give it to them .
In fact , only an officer of the law or court can take it from you , and then only with a court order .
And if they try or threaten you ?
They can be charged with theft or coercion , and you may even have civil recourse .
Cool .
( For details , see " The Photographer 's Right . " )
It gets better .
You can take photos any place that 's open to the public , whether or not it 's private property .
A mall , for example , is open to the public .
So are most office buildings ( at least the lobbies ) .
You do n't need permission ; if you have permission to enter , you have permission to shoot .
In fact , there are very few limits to what you 're allowed to photograph .
Separately , there are few limits to what you 're allowed to publish .
And the fact that they 're separate issues — shooting and publishing — is important .
We 'll get to that in a moment .
You can take any photo that does not intrude upon or invade the privacy of a person , if that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy .
Someone walking in a mall or on the street ?
Fair game .
Someone standing in a corner , looking at his new Prozac prescription ?
No .
Using a long lens to shoot someone in an apartment ?
No .
Note that the limits have nothing to do with where you are when you take the shots ; it 's all about the subject 's expectation of privacy .
You can be on private property ( a mall or office - building lobby ) , or even be trespassing and still legally take pictures .
Whether you can be someplace and whether you can take pictures are two completely separate issues .
Chances are you can publish it Publishing photos has some different restraints , although they 're civil , not criminal .
Break one of these " rules " and , while you wo n't go to jail , you could find yourself on the short end of a lawsuit .
( Although , according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , " the subject 's remedy usually will not include the ability to bar the publication of the picture . " )
Revealing private facts about someone is a no - no .
As the American Law Institute put it , " One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy , if the matter publicized is of a kind that A ) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person , and B ) is not of legitimate concern to the public . "
Here the private property issue comes a bit more into play .
Publishing a recognizable photo of someone at an AA meeting could be a problem , even if that meeting is open to the public .
( An elected official , perhaps , but not of Joe Citizen . )
You also can find yourself in civil court if you publish a shot that places a person in a false light .
That might be more of an issue with the caption than with the photo ; running a shot of the mayor and his daughter labeled " Mayor meets with porn star " could land you in hot water .
( Assuming his daughter is n't a porn star . )
Finally , you can't use someone 's likeness for a purely commercial purpose — using a photo of someone in an ad , for example .
That is n't to say you can't publish a photo in a commercial environment , such as a newspaper or a blog that accepts ads .
If the photo is being used in a news or artistic sense as opposed to a commercial one you 're OK .
Risk factors
The fact that taking a photo and publishing it are separate things might go against some folks ' common sense .
Let 's say you 're banned by the local mall for taking photos there , but you go back anyway and take more .
Now you 're trespassing .
But unless the photos you take violate someone 's expectation of privacy , your taking photos is n't illegal — only being there .
That said , if you 're arrested and convicted , a judge might use the fact that you were taking photos to increase the penalty , but shooting on private property is n't a crime in and of itself .
As one lawyer told me , " I do n't see why the act of trespass would turn something that occurs during the trespass into a tort if it was n't one already . "
There are some other risks to taking and publishing ' problematic ' photos .
But , as you 'll see , they 're easy to avoid .
Trespassing is an obvious problem .
If you 're not supposed to be someplace — you see a sign or you 're told by the property owner , for example — you can get arrested .
Sure , you might be able to publish the photos you take , but Web access from jail is limited .
( Trespassing is almost always a misdemeanor , by the way . )
You might be charged with your state 's variation of intrusion — using technology ( e.g. , a long lens , hidden camera , or parabolic microphone ) — to access a place where the subject has an expectation of privacy .
Beyond trespass , the major risks you run are civil , not criminal .
You can lose an invasion of privacy lawsuit if your photographs reveal private facts about a person that are offensive and not newsworthy when the person had a reasonable expectation of privacy .
Ditto if they place the person in a false light , or inappropriately use the specific person 's image for commercial purposes , e.g. , stating that the mayor endorses a product by publishing a photo of him using it .
All of this should be good news for amateur and professional shutterbugs .
Carry your camera , shoot to your heart 's content , and know your rights — and your risks .

His column appears Fridays on USATODAY.com .
I work at a large biotechnology firm in San Diego .
This alone was pretty cool to me when I first got the job ; but over time familiarity bred -- well , not contempt , but complacency .
In other words , working here is no longer a big deal .
Except , that is , during the few times that my work takes me away from my desk and into another part of the building .
Because then I have to take out my security badge , swipe it past a sensor , and enter a series of sealed corridors that look exactly like the ones at the Black Mesa research facility in Sierra 's first - person shooter game Half Life .
My path takes me past windows looking in on laboratories with large signs warning of RADIATION and BIOHAZARD .
Scientists in white coats peer into eerily lit test chambers .
Wooden packing crates are stacked against the corridor walls , just waiting for someone to dive behind them for cover or smash them open to get weapons or supplies .
If my errand takes me to the warehouse , a huge metal door slides up at my approach to reveal a huge , echoing space the size of an airplane hangar .
Workers on foot and in whirring forklifts wend their way through towering canyons of stacked boxes and metal fences with padlocked gates .
So sue me if I can't help imagining that one day when I 'm off in search of toner cartidges or something equally mundane , one of the labs will suddenly fill with otherworldly light .
Hideous monsters will come pouring out of one of those test chambers and run amok along these corridors .
All I 'm saying is , it had better happen on one of the days I 'm working .
I do n't know if any my co-workers have even heard of Half Life , much less played it .
So who will stop the aliens then ?
Only my hours spent gaming will stand between our world and total destruction on that day .
Did I mention the giant sliding metal door ?
Dude .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 27 - The Army has opened an investigation into whether American troops have sent gruesome photographs of Iraqi war dead to an Internet site where the soldiers were given free access to online pornography , Army officials said Tuesday .
Some photographs on the Internet site show people in American military uniforms standing around what appear to be dead bodies .
Other photos include graphic images of severed body parts and what appear to be internal organs spilling from bodies onto the ground .
The images are said to come from Afghanistan as well as Iraq .
Their authenticity has not been determined .
Paul Boyce , an Army spokesman , said that if soldiers had posted the images , their actions could violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice , which defines conduct unbecoming an officer or enlisted soldier .
Stories of trouble in the pair ’s relationship are widespread , but doubt remains over who is the driving force behind the split .
One source alleges that Vince is pulling the plug , while another claims it ’s really Jennifer , 37 , who wants out .
A report published in the US suggests that Vince , 36 , is being pressured by his mum Sharon to end the romance .
Sharon reportedly believes Jen’s on the rebound from Brad and does n’t truly love her son .
“ [ Sharon ] told him that if he married Jen , he ’d be in for a world of heartbreak , �? says a source .
“ Sharon said they needed to take a break so Jen could find closure with Brad .�?
After listening to Sharon ’s advice , Vince reportedly called off their secret nuptials .
“ He told Jen they need to take a breather , �? the source adds .
But pals of the former Friends star say it ’s Jennifer who ’s calling it off after becoming fed up with Vince ’s party - hard lifestyle .
During a recent holiday in Mexico , the couple clashed over the actor ’s boorish behaviour .
“ She says he acted like a jerk , staying up all night with his friends , drinking and smoking , �? one of Jen ’s mates reveals .
“ It dawned on her that this is n’t the kind of man she wants to marry .
“ The fact is , she dumped Vince .�?

はじめまして、こんばんは。
いきなりですが、今、chasenとかcabochaを使って
遊んでます。面白いですね。
特にコーパス言語に興味があるわけではなかったのですが、
面白半分でダウンロードしていたら、
今は短い文（精々５０００語くらい）で楽しんでます。
ところで、これからもう少し長い文にチャレンジしてみようかと思うのですが、どうしても一行一文に整斉するのが大変で、
何かいい方法があれば、教えてください。
では、お手すきのときにでもお願いします。

I was involved in disclosing a vulnerability found by a student to a production web site using custom software ( i.e. , we did n’t have access to the source code or configuration information ) .
As luck would have it , the web site got hacked .
I had to talk to a detective in the resulting police investigation .
Nothing bad happened to me , but it could have , for two reasons .
The first reason is that whenever you do something “ unnecessary ” , such as reporting a vulnerability , police wonder why , and how you found out .
Police also wonders if you found one vulnerability , could you have found more and not reported them ?
Who did you disclose that information to ?
Did you get into the web site , and do anything there that you should n’t have ?
It ’s normal for the police to think that way .
They have to .
Unfortunately , it makes it very uninteresting to report any problems .
A typical difficulty encountered by vulnerability researchers is that administrators or programmers often deny that a problem is exploitable or is of any consequence , and request a proof .
This got Eric McCarty in trouble — the proof is automatically a proof that you breached the law , and can be used to prosecute you !
Thankfully , the administrators of the web site believed our report without trapping us by requesting a proof in the form of an exploit and fixed it in record time .
We could have been in trouble if we had believed that a request for a proof was an authorization to perform penetration testing .
I believe that I would have requested a signed authorization before doing it , but it is easy to imagine a well - meaning student being not as cautious ( or I could have forgotten to request the written authorization , or they could have refused to provide it … ) .
Because the vulnerability was fixed in record time , it also protected us from being accused of the subsequent break - in , which happened after the vulnerability was fixed , and therefore had to use some other means .
If there had been an overlap in time , we could have become suspects .
The second reason that bad things could have happened to me is that I ’m stubborn and believe that in a university setting , it should be acceptable for students who stumble across a problem to report vulnerabilities anonymously through an approved person ( e.g. , a staff member or faculty ) and mechanism .
Why anonymously ?
Because student vulnerability reporters are akin to whistleblowers .
They are quite vulnerable to retaliation from the administrators of web sites ( especially if it ’s a faculty web site that is used for grading ) .
In addition , student vulnerability reporters need to be protected from the previously described situation , where they can become suspects and possibly unjustly accused simply because someone else exploited the web site around the same time that they reported the problem .
Unlike security professionals , they do not understand the risks they take by reporting vulnerabilities ( several security professionals do n’t yet either ) .
They may try to confirm that a web site is actually vulnerable by creating an exploit , without ill intentions .
Students can be guided to avoid those mistakes by having a resource person to help them report vulnerabilities .
So , as a stubborn idealist I clashed with the detective by refusing to identify the student who had originally found the problem .
I knew the student enough to vouch for him , and I knew that the vulnerability we found could not have been the one that was exploited .
I was quickly threatened with the possibility of court orders , and the number of felony counts in the incident was brandished as justification for revealing the name of the student .
My superiors also requested that I cooperate with the detective .
Was this worth losing my job ?
Was this worth the hassle of responding to court orders , subpoenas , and possibly having my computers ( work and personal ) seized ?
Thankfully , the student bravely decided to step forward and defused the situation .
As a consequence of that experience , I intend to provide the following instructions to students ( until something changes ) :
If you find strange behaviors that may indicate that a web site is vulnerable , do n’t try to confirm if it ’s actually vulnerable .
Try to avoid using that system as much as is reasonable .
Do n’t tell anyone ( including me ) , do n’t try to impress anyone , do n’t brag that you ’re smart because you found an issue , and do n’t make innuendos .
However much I wish I could , I ca n’t keep your anonymity and protect you from police questioning ( where you may incriminate yourself ) , a police investigation gone awry and miscarriages of justice .
We all want to do the right thing , and help people we perceive as in danger .
However , you should n’t help when it puts you at the same or greater risk .
The risk of being accused of felonies and having to defend yourself in court ( as if you had the money to hire a lawyer — you ’re a student ! ) is just too high .
Moreover , this is a web site , an application ; real people are not in physical danger .
Forget about it .
Delete any evidence that you knew about this problem .
You are not responsible for that web site , it ’s not your problem — you have no reason to keep any such evidence .
Go on with your life .
If you decide to report it against my advice , do n’t tell or ask me anything about it .
I ’ve exhausted my limited pool of bravery — as other people would put it , I ’ve experienced a chilling effect .
Despite the possible benefits to the university and society at large , I ’m intimidated by the possible consequences to my career , bank account and sanity .
I agree with HD Moore , as far as production web sites are concerned : “ There is no way to report a vulnerability safely ” .
Edit ( 5/24/06 ) : Most of the comments below are interesting , and I ’m glad you took the time to respond .
After an email exchange with CERT / CC , I believe that they can genuinely help by shielding you from having to answer questions from and directly deal with law enforcement , as well as from the pressures of an employer .
There is a limit to the protection that they can provide , and past that limit you may be in trouble , but it is a valuable service .

SQLインジェクションに関する脆弱性の修正などを行ったPostgreSQL
8.1.4,8.0.8，7.4.13，7.3.15の各バージョンが，5月23日一斉にリリースされた（関連記事）。いずれも同じメジャーバージョン系列であれば，dump/restoreによるデータ移行なしでアップグレードできる(ただし，8.1，8.1.1から8.1.4への移行については注意が必要。詳細は付属のリリースノートを参照されたい ) 。
修正が提供されな いPostgreSQL 7.2以前のバージョン
今回対策された脆弱性 はPostgreSQL 7.2以前にも存在するが，開発者のポリシーにより，7.2以前はサポートの対象になっていない。いまだに7.2 以前のバージョンを使っているユーザーは，7.3以降にアップグレードするか，脆弱性が発生しないような使い方を考慮するしかない。
今までにない大規模な 「 マイナー」バージョンアップ
バージョン番号の下2けた目が変わるマイナーバージョンアップでは，通常バグ修正など，最小限の修正が行われるためコードの修正量はわずかである。しかし今回の修正量は今までにない量であり(diff - cで約2万ステップ)，しかも新しいC言語インターフェイス用の関数が追加されている。通常マイナーバージョンアップではこれは極めて異例のことである。
そもそも今回の脆弱性に関する問題提起は，日本PostgreSQLユーザー会北海道支部長の石田氏と四国支部長の大垣氏の両氏から行われた。筆者がそれをコアメンバーに連絡したのが2月頃のこと。両氏と筆者がコアメンバーと協議する形で修正方針を議論してきた。脆弱性の修正はできる限り完璧に行う必要があるが，一方でできるだけ既存のアプリケーションの修正は少ない方がよい。このあたりのさじ加減をめぐって長い議論が行われ，結果的として膨大な量のパッチとなったが，当初の目的はほぼ達成できたと考えている。
日本語のユーザーに大きな影響
今回対策された脆弱性は ，SJISやEUC-JP，UTF-8などのマルチバイト文字エンコーディングに関連しており，日本語を使用するシステムでは非常に影響が大きい。そこで本稿では，今回対策された脆弱性の詳細な内容とそれに対する修正内容を詳細に解説する。
文字エンコーディングについて
今回の修正内容を説明する前に，文字エンコーディング(以下「エンコーディング」)に関する知識を整理しておこう。ここが分かっていないと，今回の脆弱性，そしてそれに対する対策を理解するのが難しいからである。
以下，文字エンコーディングについて詳しい読者は読み飛ばしていただきたい。
コンピュータに文字を記録するには何らかの符号化が必要である。例えばASCIIコードではアルファベット小文字の「a」は97(16進数で0x61)に置き換えられて処理される。ASCIIでは英語と数字を符号化することしか考えていないので，1文字につき1バイトの記憶領域があればコンピュータに格納できる。そのため，長い間コンピュータは1文字=1バイトで処理を行ってきた。
しかし日本語には漢字などの多数の文字が含まれているため，1文字を1バイトでは表現できない。そこで日本語を符号化する2つの方法が考えられた。一つは1文字を1バイトではなく，2バイト整数や4バイト整数で表現する方法である。これは「ワイド文字」と呼ばれることがある。一方，1文字を可変長の複数のバイトで表現することも考えられる。この方法によって符号化したものを「マルチバイト文字」と呼ぶ。前述のように，コンピュータは長い間文字列処理と言えばバイト単位で処理してきたため，ワイド文字を使うためにはプログラムの修正が必要になる。マルチバイト方式ならば修正量が少なくなる可能性がある。PostgreSQLもマルチバイト文字方式を採用している(一部ワイド文字も併用 ) 。
符号化文字集 合
日本語を符号化する場合の「日本語」とは具体的にどのような文字を指しているのだろうか。平仮名や漢字は明らかに日本語だが，数字や記号やギリシャ文字はどうなるのだろう。これらは日本語ではないが，日常に必要な文字だ(ギリシャ文字は日常では使わないかもしれないが，これがないと教科書が書けない)。そこでJIS(日本工業規格)で符号化対象の文字種が決められている。
規格名 含まれる主な文字種 JIS X 0201 英数字およびカタカ ナ( いわ ゆ る1バイトカナ ) JIS X 0208 平仮名，カタカナ( いわゆる全角カタカナ ) ，第1，第2水準漢字，記号，ギリシャ文字など JIS X 0212 補助漢字 JIS X 0213 第3，第4水準漢字，記号 JIS X 0221 ISO / IEC 10646 ( UNICODE )
これらは 「符号化文字集合」ないし単に「文字集合」と呼ばれる。このように，日本語用の文字集合と言っても複数あり，しかも実際には複数の文字集合を組み合わせて使うことが多い。
例えばJIS X 0201 +JIS X 0208 +JIS X 0212というのが多いパターンである。JIS
X 0221は例外で，これ一つで単独で使われる。
PostgreSQLがサポートする日本語のエンコーディング方式
PostgreSQLがサポートする日本語のエンコーディング方式は以下のようになる(すべてマルチバイト方式 ) 。
EUC_JP
文字集合のうち ，ASCII，JIS X 0201，JIS X 0208 ，JIS X 0212を扱う。内部表現は以下のようになる。
文字集合 内部表 現 ASCII 1バイトで表現。値の範囲は0x7fま で JIS X 0201 0x8e+1バイトの2バイトで表現。値の範囲は0x8ea1から0x8edf
JIS X 0208 2バイトで表現。値の範囲は0xa1a0から0xa1fe JIS X 0212 0x8f+2バイトで表現。値の範囲は0x8fa1a0から0x8fa1fe
EUC_JPでは，1バイト目を見ると文字集合とバイト数が分かる。また，ASCII以外はすべてのバイトが0x80以上の値になっている。これはとても大切なことで，ASCIIには「\」( バックスラッシュ ) や 「'」( シングルクォート)などの特別な役割をする文字が含まれており，EUC_JPの文字種を構成するバイトはこれらの特殊文字と値がバッティングしないことが保証されているのである。したがって，ASCIIしか扱えないプログラムでも，0x80以上を通すようにすれば，最低限日本語が使えるプログラムにすることができるというわけだ。
なおEUC_JPは通常「 EUC-JP」と表記するが，PostgreSQLでは「-」は「 "
」で囲わないと使用できないため，あえてEUC_JPとしている。以下，UTF-8などについても同様である。
UTF_8
文字集合 内部表 現 ASCII 1バイトで表現。値の範囲は0x7fま で JIS X 0221 2から4バイトで表現。各バイトの値は0x80以上
UTF_8では，ASCII以外の場合には各バイトが0x80以上になっているので，EUC_JPと同様，ASCIIの特殊文字とバッティングせず，プログラムで扱いやすいという特徴を持っている。またEUC_JPと同様，先頭バイトを見れば1文字を構成するバイト長が分かるようになっている。
SJIS
文字集合 内部表現 ASCII 1バイトで表現。値の範囲は0x7fま で JIS X 0201 1バイトで表現。値の範囲は0xa1から0xdf JIS X 0208 2バイトで表現。値の範囲は1バイト目が0x81から0x9fおよび0xe0から0xef。2バイト目が0x40から0x7eおよび0x8cから0xfc
SJISでは，EUC_JPやUTF_8とは違って，JIS
X 0208を表現する2バイト目にASCIIと重複する値が含まれている。このためプログラムでの扱いはやっかいであり，PostgreSQLではデータベース用のエンコーディングとしては使えない。フロントエンドでSJISを使いたいときは，データベース用のエンコーディングをEUC_JPかUTF_8にしておき，PostgreSQLが自動変換を行う。
実は今回対策した脆弱性の半分はSJISにまつわるものである。

I love to play cards .
I 've spent many hours sitting around a kitchen table playing pinochle , euchre or spades .
But I think my favorite card game is bridge .
More specifically , the variant of bridge which fascinates me is called " duplicate " .
The basic idea of duplicate bridge is that your score is a function of how well you play your cards as compared to how the other teams played the exact same cards .
Just to be clear , let me repeat :
In duplicate bridge , you are playing the same cards as your opponents .
The luck of the deal is basically eliminated .
You have 13 cards in your hand , so there are 13 " tricks " available to win .
If you are dealt excellent cards , there is no particular reason to get excited .
Yes , your cards will take lots of tricks , but that 's not the point .
The issue is whether you take as many tricks as the other people who play those exact same cards .
If you take nine tricks but somebody else finds a way to take ten , you lose .
Duplicate bridge is a brutal game .
Every small mistake can be very costly .
I do like to go to the local bridge club sometimes , but I usually end up in last place .
At the end of the evening , I review each hand and figure out what went wrong .
Even though I am terribly bad at this game , I still enjoy it because every game is such a learning experience .
I often wonder what other pursuits would be like if they had to operate under the same rules : Resources and context do not change -- the only variable is the ability of the person managing those resources .
These questions become particularly interesting to me when asked in the field of software product management .
For a given piece of technology or code , what would happen if somebody else were managing it ?
If I were managing the Delphi product instead of Borland , could I do a better job ?
If Joel Spolsky were managing Vault instead of me , would the product have more users ?

Courtesy of The Carpetbagger , I came across this superb Brookings Institution Report on the situation in Iraq .
This is my kind of report - almost solid graphs and tables .
You can read it for an hour and have a far better idea of the situation than reading the newspaper for a year , and I highly recommend you do so .
[ editor 's note , by Prof. Goose ]
Stuart also asked me to slip this article in from the NYT about the recent instability through the war - torn country .
As we 've discussed before , there 's almost certainly a lot of untapped oil reserves in Iraq , and whether they ever get produced or not is primarily controlled by whether the country stabilizes .
So , while I should stress that the human and political dimensions to the situation are very important , the main way it interacts with Oil Drum concerns is whether or not the energy can be counted on in the world 's supply budget or not .
In short , is the overall trend of recent years in this next graph going to continue ?
Or is the improvement in the last few months the start of a real turnaround ?
Average Iraqi daily oil + condensate production , by month , January 2000 - April 2006 .
The US and allies invaded in March 2003 .
Click to enlarge .
Source : EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.1a .
Trend line is linear least squares fit to all the data .
Let 's start with the good news .
The likely cause of the improvement is that the number of attacks on oil and gas infrastructure has been dropping of late :
Number of attacks on Iraqi oil and gas infrastructure each month .
June 2003 - June 2006 , but last month is incomplete .
Source : Brookings Institution
Other good news is that the number of US troops killed and wounded each month is also dropping , though very slowly .
Number of US troops wounded in action each month , March 2003 - July 2006 .
July 06 data is incomplete .
Source : Brookings Institution
Still , there 's room to wonder if troop casualties are dropping because the insurgency is better controlled , or because we are giving up sizeable areas to effective insurgent control .
The casualties in the Iraqi government forces are dropping also :
Number of Iraqi military and police killed monthly , Jan 2005 to July 2006 , with longer term averages from March 2003 - December 2004 .
July 06 data is incomplete .
Source : Brookings Institution
However , it 's hard to take these trends as cause for real optimism , as opposed to a signal that we are shifting from an insurgency against the US occupation to a civil war between the Sunni and the Shia .
Certainly the civilian death toll is trending ever more tragic :
Iraqi civilians killed as a result of acts of war since May 1st , 2003 .
Source : Brookings Institution .
July data is incomplete .
The totals of people killed and wounded in multiple fatality bombings is really striking , and the trend here is terrible :
Monthly totals of people killed or wounded as a result of bombings with at least three fatalities ( including IEDs / roadside bombs ) .
Source : Brookings Institution .
July data is incomplete .
Iraqis are losing hope :
Answers to poll question " Thinking about the future , do you feel that things will be better , the same or worse in six months ? " .
Source : Brookings Institution .
But perhaps the most alarming thing is the extreme degrees of polarization that polling reveals .
The next two charts come from data from a poll of Iraqis taken Jan 31st , 2006 .
The first question was " Do you think that Iraq today is generally headed in the right direction or wrong direction ? " .
The chart shows " right direction " .
Answers to poll question " Do you think that Iraq today is generally headed in the right direction or wrong direction ? " by ethnic group .
The chart shows the percentage who answered " right direction " .
Has it all been worth while ?
Depends who you ask :
Answers to poll question " Thinking about any hardships you might have suffered since the US - Britain invasion , do you personally think that ousting Saddam Hussein was worth it or not ? " by ethnic group .
The chart shows the percentage who answered " worth it " .
How are these groups ever going to agree on terms to stop fighting ?
To put some color on the statistics , here 's a quote from a New York Times story the other day :
Iraqi soldiers backed by American troops and military aircraft stormed a building in a Shiite slum here early today , killing or wounding between 30 and 40 gunmen and capturing a high - level Shiite militia commander who is accused of attacking Iraqi and American troops , the American military command said .
American and Iraqi authorities did not disclose the name of the captured man they said was a militia commander .
But residents of the neighborhood said the building that came under attack was a base of operations for a man known as Abu Deraa , a top commander of the Mahdi Army , the restless and potent Shiite militia that answers to the Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr .
In a concurrent operation today , Iraqi police officers captured Adnan al - Unaybi , who , according to the American military command , is in charge of a wing of the Mahdi Army operating in Babil Province , south of Baghdad .
A military news release said that he was accused of weapons smuggling , bankrolling terrorism , attacking American troops , inciting sectarian violence and " spying for two foreign governments . "
Sunni fighters operating from an area called al - Muheet , a district of old brick factories now used for residential housing , have killed many Shia from nearby farming districts .
" One of them was a man called Hussein who used to sell me melons , " said a local informant .
" They cut his head off . "
In the past few days three women were allegedly raped and killed .
This provoked a backlash in the heavily Shia al - Khadamiyah , the site of one of the holiest Shia shrines .
Some 400 local people joined with the Mehdi Army yesterday to launch an attack on al - Muheet , starting a gun battle which lasted much of the day .
The Shia claim that US troops intervened to stop them eliminating sectarian killers .
and another incident recorded in the The Independent Can anyone see any way that this is not going to continue sliding into an ever more violent civil war ?
Well , our sunny optimist friends over at the EIA are unconcerned , of course .
They 're projecting 3.3 mbpd of oil production by 2010 .
Given that the investments required to do that would need to be started right around now , it 's extremely hard to see how that figure could be reached by then .

Before 9/11 the Federal Emergency Management Agency listed the three most likely catastrophic disasters facing America : a terrorist attack on New York , a major earthquake in San Francisco and a hurricane strike on New Orleans .
" The New Orleans hurricane scenario , " The Houston Chronicle wrote in December 2001 , " may be the deadliest of all . "
It described a potential catastrophe very much like the one now happening .
So why were New Orleans and the nation so unprepared ?
After 9/11 , hard questions were deferred in the name of national unity , then buried under a thick coat of whitewash .
This time , we need accountability .
First question :
Why have aid and security taken so long to arrive ?
Katrina hit five days ago -- and it was already clear by last Friday that Katrina could do immense damage along the Gulf Coast .
Yet the response you 'd expect from an advanced country never happened .
Thousands of Americans are dead or dying , not because they refused to evacuate , but because they were too poor or too sick to get out without help -- and help was n't provided .
Many have yet to receive any help at all .
There will and should be many questions about the response of state and local governments ; in particular , could n't they have done more to help the poor and sick escape ?
But the evidence points , above all , to a stunning lack of both preparation and urgency in the federal government 's response .
Muslim protesters infuriated by cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad raised the diplomatic stakes last night as Iran 's best - selling newspaper announced it would retaliate by running images satirising the Holocaust .
The decision by the rightwing Hamshari daily to launch an international competition to find the most suitable caricatures came as demonstrators hurled firebombs and stones at the Danish embassy in Tehran and the Iranian government imposed a formal trade ban on Danish imports .
Last night mobs were attempting to storm the Danish compound .
In London , the home secretary , Charles Clarke , branded the activities of Islamist protesters outside the Danish embassy last week as " unacceptable " .
He told MPs he was pleased the response to the publication of the Danish cartoons had " in general been respectful and restrained in the best traditions of British tolerance " .
But he added : " If the police conclude there have been breaches of the law and decide to take any action , we would , of course , support them . "
Scotland Yard has set up a special squad to investigate the demonstrations and the placards on display which called for the death of those who " insult Islam " .
The inquiry will examine everything from video recordings made by officers to photographs published in newspapers .
One protester , who was photographed apparently dressed like a suicide bomber , apologised " wholeheartedly " yesterday .
Omar Khayam , 22 , appeared outside his house in Bedford accompanied by the chairman of his local mosque and his local MP .
He said he had not intended to cause offence to the victims of the July 7 London bombings or their relatives but added that his protest remained valid because of the hurt caused to Muslims by the publication of the Danish cartoons .
" I felt the Danish newspaper had been provocative and controversial , deeply offensive and insensitive .
But by me dressing the way I did , I did just that , exactly the same as the Danish newspaper , if not worse .
My method of protest has offended many people , especially the families of the victims of the July bombings .
This was not my intention . "
Fresh protests raged across the Muslim world throughout the day , claiming four lives in Afghanistan and one in Somalia , but the involvement of the Iranian authorities added a further twist to the diplomatic tensions between western governments and Tehran .
Hamshari is owned by Tehran city council and its plan follows a string of anti-Zionist statements by Iran 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has dismissed the killing of 6 million Jews by the Nazis in the second world war as a " myth " and called for Israel to be " wiped off the map " .
Farid Mortazavi , the paper 's graphics editor , said the cartoons would be published to test the argument of western newspapers which have cited freedom of expression in printing the prophet Muhammad images .
" The western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression , so let 's see if they mean what they say and also print these Holocaust cartoons , " Mr Mortazavi said .
There were attacks earlier in the day on the Austrian embassy in Tehran .
Iran 's trade with Denmark is worth around £ 160 m a year .
In Afghanistan , police opened fire on 2,000 protesters as they tried to break into the main US base in Bagram , north of Kabul , killing two and wounding five , said local chief Kabir Ahmed .
No US soldiers were involved .
Another two demonstrators died in the central town of Mehtarlam , after police fired live rounds into a crowd of demonstrators burning tyres and hurling rocks .
A shot from within the crowd provoked the police into shooting , officials said .
An Austrian newspaper , Kleine Zeitung , became the latest European publication to print the controversial cartoons .
The paper admitted several of its Muslim distributors had refused to sell the day 's issue and said some had torn the offending caricatures out .
Several European countries , including Austria , have now warned citizens not to travel to the Middle East .
The cartoons have been published in virtually every major country across Europe - except Britain .
Ukrainian papers published the cartoons yesterday , joining Denmark , Norway , France , Ireland , Germany , Italy , Spain , Switzerland , Bulgaria , Hungary , and Poland .
Speaking from Beirut , Omar Bakri Mohammad , the leader of the Islamist group al - Muhajiroun which is banned in Britain , called for those who " blasphemed " against the prophet to be executed .
" In Islam , God said , and the messenger Muhammad said , whoever insults a prophet , he must be punished and executed , " he told BBC radio .
Political and religious leaders in Lebanon attempted to calm sectarian tensions a day after Islamic extremists torched the building housing the Danish embassy and rampaged through a Christian quarter of Beirut .
Lebanon 's interior minister , Hassan Sabei , who resigned on Sunday , blamed a hardcore of infiltrators .
The protests spread even further across the Muslim world .
There were fresh disturbances in India , Indonesia , Palestine and Thailand .
In Somalia , a 14 - year - old boy died during clashes with police in the port city of Bosasso after protesters hurled stones at offices used by international aid agencies .

I ’m not talking about Michael J. Fox ’s television ad for Claire McCaskill .
I ’m talking about rightie reaction to it .
Apparently embryonic stem cell research is a big issue in the McCaskill - Talent senatorial campaign in Missouri .
The Democrat , McCaskill , is fer it , and the Republican , Talent , is agin ’ it .
Sam Hananel of Forbes describes the ad made by Fox :
His body visibly wracked by tremors , actor Michael J. Fox speaks out for Missouri Democratic Senate candidate Claire McCaskill in a television ad that promotes her support for embryonic stem cell research .
“ As you might know I care deeply about stem cell research , ” says 45 - year - old actor , who has struggled with Parkinson ’s disease for more than a decade .
“ In Missouri you can elect Claire McCaskill , who shares my hope for cures . ”
McCaskill has made support for the research a key part of her campaign to unseat Sen. Jim Talent .
The Republican incumbent opposes the research as unethical , saying it destroys human embryos .
The new ad debuted prominently Saturday night during Game 1 of the World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Tigers and will continue airing statewide this week , a campaign spokeswoman said .
I bet everybody in the state saw it , then .
Debate over stem cell research looms large in the state , where voters are considering a ballot measure that would amend the state constitution to protect all federally allowed forms of the research , including embryonic stem cell research .
“ Unfortunately , Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research , ” Fox says in the 30 - second spot .
“ Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us a chance for hope . ”
Rightie reaction ?
John Amato has an audio of Rush Limbaugh accusing Fox of faking his symptoms .
“ He is an actor , after all , ” says Rush .
( Rush is from a very wealthy and influential southeast Missouri family . )
Dean Barnett , writing at Hugh Hewitt ’s blog , disgusts me just as much .
I have annotated the quote with footnotes .
By way of response , let me first say that I think almost any kind of ad in support of a political campaign is fair game .
If a candidate goes too far , the public will punish him or her .
So while I find the Michael J. Fox ad crass , tasteless , [ 1 ] exploitative and absurd , I fully support Claire McCaskillâ€™s right to shoot herself in the foot . [ 2 ]
The most distasteful aspect of the ad is the way it exploits Michael J. Foxâ€™s physical difficulties . [ 3 ]
Fox is an actor , and clearly knew what he was doing when he signed up for the spot – no victim points for him for having been manipulated by the McCaskill campaign .
[ 4 ]
The adâ€™s aim is to make us feel so bad about Foxâ€™s condition that logical debate is therefore precluded . [ 5 ]
You either agree with Fox , or you sadistically endorse his further suffering as Fox accuses Jim Talent of doing .
This is demagoguery analogous to the pernicious and pathetic chickenhawk argument .
The whole â€œchickenhawkâ€ logic is that only people who have served in the military are entitled to have an opinion on military matters .
Thus , the ideas of non-veterans donâ€™t warrant a hearing and thus donâ€™t need rebutting .
[ 6 ]
While Michael J. Fox ( like me ) has some skin in the stem cell game that most people donâ€™t , that doesnâ€™t give him any special appreciation of the moral issues involved with embryonic stem cell research .
Sick people may want cures and treatments more than the healthy population , but that doesnâ€™t make them / us experts on morality . [ 7 ]
My comments :
[ 1 ] I ’m sorry that Dean Barnett takes offense at the sight of other peoples ’ suffering .
I ’m sure that in Dean Barnett ’s perfect world , sick and handicapped people would be kept hidden away so the sight of them does not upset healthy people .
[ 2 ]
On the other hand , crass remarks about Michael J. Fox ’s infirmities are certain to rally voters to the Republican cause .
[ 3 ]
Not only are physical infirmities tasteless ; they also confer an unfair advantage .
[ 4 ]
Fox was “ manipulated ” by McCaskill ?
Apparently people with disabilities have lost the right to be free agents .
[ 5 ]
Ooo , “ logical ” debate !
I wrote about “ logical ” morality yesterday .
I ’ll come back to it again in a minute .
[ 6 ]
A stirring argument .
Too bad that Burnett ’s “ chickenhawk ” is a straw bird .
[ 7 ]
Actually , I ’d say the Fox ad is less an argument for morality than a test of morality .
If you see the ad and feel compassion for Fox , you pass .

The Anchoress claims
Fox is fighting for “ bad science . ”
I ’ve already explained here and here that it ’s righties like the Anchoress who lie through their teeth about the science .
Sister Toldjah , no lightweight in the idiot department , compares the ad to race baiting .
( Go ahead and pause to ponder that one , if you need to . )
At NRO , Kathryn Jean Lopez ladles the lies on thick and heavy by claiming the issue is about cloning .
She links to this anti-science web site that says —
When you see Amendment 2 at your polling place , you will be asked to decide whether to “ ban human cloning or attempted cloning . ”
Sounds good so far , right ?
Who ’s in favor of human cloning anyway ?
But the 2,100 - word Constitutional Amendmentâ € ” which you wo n’t see on election dayâ € ” actually creates legal protection for human cloning .
Hard to believe ?
It ’s true .
Amendment 2 only outlaws reproductive cloning , which no one in Missouri ( or anywhere else on earth ) is doing .
Meanwhile , it protects anyone who wants to clone human beings for science experiments .
Amendment 2 glosses over the issue of lab - created human life with complicated phrases like “ Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer . ”
But cloning is cloning , and Amendment 2 would put this ethically questionable practice beyond the reach of state law .
And the Big Lie is , of course , that non-reproductive cloning , also called “ therapeutic ” cloning , does not clone “ human beings . ”
In therapeutic cloning the cloned cells do not develop into an embryo but instead are used only to develop stem cells .
A stem cell is no more a “ being ” than a toenail .
The fact is that righties are just plain on the wrong side of the embryonic stem cell issue .
They ’re on the wrong side of it both morally and scientifically .
Whine all they like , that ’s not going to change .
I ’m afraid they ’ll be whining for a while .

Update : See Jonathan Cohn , who interviews William J. Weiner M.D. , professor and chairman of the department of neurology at the University of Maryland Medical Center and director of the Parkinson ’s clinic there .
Dr. Weiner said :
What you are seeing on the video is side effects of the medication .
He has to take that medication to sit there and talk to you like that .
…
He ’s not over - dramatizing .
… [ Limbaugh ] is revealing his ignorance of Parkinson ’s disease , because people with Parkinson ’s do n’t look like that at all when they ’re not taking their medication .
They look stiff , and frozen , and do n’t move at all .
…
People with Parkinson ’s , when they ’ve had the disease for awhile , are in this bind , where if they do n’t take any medication , they can be stiff and hardly able to talk .
And if they do take their medication , so they can talk , they get all of this movement , like what you see in the ad .

I.B.M. , the holder of the largest patent storehouse in corporate America , often finds itself defending itself against patent claims from aggressive plaintiffs , seeking a payout .
But I.B.M. became the aggressor yesterday when it filed two lawsuits against Amazon.com , contending that the company has built its big online retail business on technology developed by I.B.M .
The suits , filed in two federal courts in Texas , seek unspecified damages , but I.B.M. says that Amazon ’s infringement is broad , suggesting the potential for a sizable judgment or settlement .
An I.B.M. spokesman said the figure could run to hundreds of millions of dollars .
“ These patents are core to modern electronic commerce , ” said John E. Kelly III , senior vice president for technology and intellectual property at I.B.M.
“ Most if not all of Amazon ’s business is built on top of this technology . ”
The 21st century will be marked by a crucial debate : how can we make economic and social development compatible with the preservation of our natural environment ?
The challenge is faced by developed and developing countries alike , but the burdens need to be more equally shared .
The width of the divide between rich and poor countries has doubled over the last 40 years .
While the developed world has benefited from the prosperity generated by economic progress , poor countries suffer the consequences of environmental degradation resulting from uncontrolled growth .
Rich countries have unsustainable patterns of production and consumption .
They are responsible for 41 % of total carbon dioxide emissions , and their overall consumption of raw materials is four times greater than that of all other countries combined .
With those conditions , there is no possibility of a sustainable future .
The scale of Brazil 's natural assets is extraordinary : the Amazon region contains 20 % of the planet 's fresh water , and almost two - thirds of the country is still covered by natural vegetation .
Against this backdrop we have been implementing policies that directly address our most pressing environmental concerns .
When I began my term of office , the rate of deforestation in Brazil had been increasing by an average of 27 % per year .
From the second half of 2004 onwards , however , we put measures in place to monitor tree - felling and to address the issue of land distribution , with the result that the rate of deforestation has fallen dramatically .
In a country that suffers from profound social inequalities , however , the success of environmental policy ultimately depends more than anything on economic and social measures that are themselves geared towards the preservation of our environment .
Over the next 10 years we will place an additional 13 m hectares of the Amazon region under a management regime that will guarantee the forest 's regeneration cycle .
And our commitment to a responsible approach extends well beyond our own territory .
It is imperative that we put into practice the commitments of the Kyoto protocol to combat the potentially devastating impact of global warming .
In the search for new , sustainable economic models , the international community is coming to recognise the need for a radical rethink in relation to the generation of energy , and Brazil is responding by using clean , renewable , alternative energy sources to an ever - greater extent .
More than 40 % of Brazil 's energy comes from " green " sources , in comparison with around 7 % in rich countries .
The ethanol Brazil produces from sugar cane is attracting worldwide interest , for it is one of the cheapest and most dependable types of fuel derived from renewable sources .
Three - quarters of the cars now being produced in Brazil have " flex - fuel " engines , capable of running on either ethanol or petrol , or any mixture of the two .
The government has implemented environmental initiatives that are also bringing social benefits - for example in the form of the biodiesel project .
Produced from oil - bearing plants , biodiesel is significantly less polluting than conventional petroleum - based diesel .
As it can easily be produced by small farmers in some of the poorest regions of the country , the project combines environmental protection with rural development , and reduces social inequality .
There is a great potential for biodiesel in Africa .
Brazil is actively preparing itself for a new development paradigm that will meet the environmental and social challenges of the coming decades .
Ethanol and biodiesel are the key components of our approach , and we are determined to " plant the oil of the future " .
I invite you to join us in our endeavours .

For many women , the correlation between sex and snoring is one of those annoying facts of life : no matter when passionate encounters occur , men always seem to fall asleep immediately afterwards .
Dave Zinczenko , the author of Men , Love and Sex : The Complete User Guide For Women , explained the phenomenon to Huffington Post writer Arianna Huffington this way : “ Men go to sleep because women do n’t turn into a pizza . ”
I doubt I am ever going to become a pizza , and I ’ll never have the foresight to order one beforehand .
So in lieu of a cure , a better explanation will have to do .
Although women sometimes feel sleepy after sex , the phenomenon does seem more pronounced in men .
What is it , then , that spirals them into the land of nod ?
First , the obvious reasons for sex ’s somnolent sway : the act frequently takes place at night , in a bed , and is , after all , physically exhausting ( often more so for the man than the woman , although this certainly varies ) .
So when sex is over , it ’s natural for a guy to feel sleepy .
Secondly , research using positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans has shown that in order for a person to reach orgasm , a primary requirement is to let go of “ all fear and anxiety . ”
Doing so also tends to be relaxing and might explain the tendency to snooze .
Then there is the biochemistry of the orgasm itself .
Research shows that during ejaculation , men release a cocktail of brain chemicals , including norepinephrine , serotonin , oxytocin , vasopressin , nitric oxide ( NO ) , and the hormone prolactin .
The release of prolactin is linked to the feeling of sexual satisfaction , and it also mediates the “ recovery time ” that men are well aware of — the time a guy must wait before “ giving it another go . ”
Studies have also shown that men deficient in prolactin have faster recovery times .
Prolactin levels are naturally higher during sleep , and animals injected with the chemical become tired immediately .
This suggests a strong link between prolactin and sleep , so it ’s likely that the hormone ’s release during orgasm causes men to feel sleepy .
( Side note : prolactin also explains why men are sleepier after intercourse than after masturbation .
For unknown reasons , intercourse orgasms release four times more prolactin than masturbatory orgasms , according to a recent study . )
Oxytocin and vasopressin , two other chemicals released during orgasm , are also associated with sleep .
Their release frequently accompanies that of melatonin , the primary hormone that regulates our body clocks .
Oxytocin is also thought to reduce stress levels , which again could lead to relaxation and sleepiness .
What about the evolutionary reasons for post - sex sleepiness ?
This is trickier to explain .
Evolutionarily speaking , a man ’s primary goal is to produce as many offspring as possible , and sleeping does n’t exactly help in his quest .
But perhaps since he cannot immediately run off with another woman anyway — damn that recovery time !— re-energizing himself via sleep may be the best use of his time .
And although there is conflicting information as to whether women feel sleepy after sex , a woman often falls asleep with the man anyway ( or uses it for some key cuddling time ) , which is good news for him : it means she is not off finding another mate .
When the man wakes up and she ’s still there , he just might be ready to go again .
It ’s also possible that sleepiness is just a “ side effect ” associated with a more evolutionarily important reason for the release of oxytocin and vasopressin .
In addition to being associated with sleep , both chemicals are also intimately involved in what is called “ pair bonding , ” the social attachment human mates commonly share .
The release of these brain chemicals during orgasm heightens feelings of bonding and trust between sexual partners , which may partially explain the link between sex and emotional attachment .
This bond is favorable should the couple have a baby , as cooperative child rearing maximizes the young one ’s chances for survival .
The bottom line is this : there are many potential biochemical and evolutionary reasons for post - sex sleepiness , some direct and some indirect — but no one has yet pinpointed the exact causes .
One thing , however , is certain : we females better get used to it , because it does n’t look likely to change anytime soon .
I will leave frustrated American women with one final thought : if you are upset at the ubiquity of the post - sex snoring phenomenon , remember that things could be a lot worse .
A recent survey of 10,000 English men revealed that 48 percent actually fall asleep during sex .
Talk about coitus interruptus !
Among the many temptations of the digital age , photo- manipulation has proved particularly troublesome for science , and scientific journals are beginning to respond .
Some journal editors are considering adopting a test , in use at The Journal of Cell Biology , that could have caught the concocted images of the human embryonic stem cells made by Dr. Hwang Woo Suk .
At The Journal of Cell Biology , the test has revealed extensive manipulation of photos .
Since 2002 , when the test was put in place , 25 percent of all accepted manuscripts have had one or more illustrations that were manipulated in ways that violate the journal 's guidelines , said Michael Rossner of Rockefeller University , the executive editor .
The editor of the journal , Ira Mellman of Yale , said that most cases were resolved when the authors provided originals .
" In 1 percent of the cases we find authors have engaged in fraud , " he said .
The two editors recognized the likelihood that images were being improperly manipulated when the journal required all illustrations to be submitted in digital form .
While reformatting illustrations submitted in the wrong format , Dr. Rossner realized that some authors had yielded to the temptation of Photoshop 's image - changing tools to misrepresent the original data .
The software design owes an obvious debt to the TiVo 's famous attention to detail .
In fact , the MovieBeam service is so easy to use , it easily passes what home - theater aficionados call the Baby Sitter Test .
The compact remote control is n't illuminated , but it does n't have to be ; you control playback functions with one thumb by touch alone .
The movies represent every genre : comedy , action , drama , kids , horror , and so on .
They come from every major movie studio except Sony ( MovieBeam says a deal is imminent ) .
You can view them alphabetically or by category , including Coming Soon and Leaving Soon .
When you highlight a movie title , details appear and its Hollywood trailer plays automatically .
The picture and sound quality are excellent on standard TV sets , although you should be warned that most of them play in wide - screen format .
On standard sets , that means that you 'll get black letterbox bars above and below the picture .
MovieBeam could also play an important role in the new era of high - definition movies — once it gets its act together .
Each month , about four of its movies are offered in high definition ( for an additional $ 1 each ) , which you can enjoy on any HDTV set that has — stand back for oncoming jargon — either an HDMI jack or a DVI connector with HDCP .
Image FOR RENT MovieBeam is a slim set - top box that downloads movies over the airwaves as they become available and stores 100 at a time .
It costs $ 200 ; there is no monthly fee ; and you pay only for movies you watch .
At the moment , though , MovieBeam is muffing its opportunity here .
The graphics and menus look spectacular , but the clarity and detail of the movies themselves fall far short of what you think of as high - def .
( When Nicole Kidman 's skin looks grainy , you know something 's off . )
The company blames , not altogether convincingly , the HD transfers from the original film , and promises better - looking HD movies in the coming months .
Otherwise , though , you 'll have a tough time finding much to criticize about the MovieBeam experience .
The real question is whether MovieBeam can find a niche that 's not already served by the 435 other movie - delivery channels .
The top three languages used in solving the Project Euler puzzles are , in order :
C/C++ ( 227 )
Java ( 107 )
Python ( 91 )
However , the average score of people using those languages :
Python ( 31 % )
C/C+ + ( 19 % )
Java ( 19 % )
QED :-)
( NOTE : Delphi and APL / J/K programmers are even smarter , apparently )
UPDATE ( 2006-01 -21 ) : I may have inadvertently skewed the statistics by this post ( and its appearance on Planet Python and the Daily Python URL ) .
Since my post , the number of C/C++ programmers has risen by 19 % , the number of Java programmers by 13 % but the number of Python programmers by 86 % .
So there are a disproportionate number of newcomers amongst the Python programmers .
Because one starts off with a low score , the average score is skewed unless the Python - programming newcomers stick with it .
Note that even with this skewing , Python still beats C/C++ and Java for average programmer score :-)
Booksellers , you are the salt of the book world .
You are on the front line where , while the author cowers in his opium den , you encounter — or " interface with , " as we say now — the rare and mysterious Americans who are willing to plunk down $ 25 for a book .
Bookstores are lonely forts , spilling light onto the sidewalk .
They civilize their neighborhoods .
At my mother 's side I used to visit the two stores in downtown Reading , Pa. , a city then of 100,000 , and I still recall their names and locations — the Book Mart , at Sixth Street and Court , and the Berkshire News , on Fifth Street , in front of the trolley stop that would take us home to Shillington .
When I went away to college , I marveled at the wealth of bookstores around Harvard Square .
In addition to the Coop and various outlets where impecunious students like myself could buy tattered volumes polluted by someone else 's underlinings and marginalia , there were bookstores that catered to the Cambridge bourgeoisie , the professoriate , and those elite students with money and reading time to spare .
The Grolier , specializing in modern poetry , occupied a choice niche on Plympton Street , and over on Boylston there was the Mandrake , a more spacious sanctum for books of rare , pellucid and modernist water .
In the Mandrake — presided over by a soft - voiced short man , with brushed - back graying hair — there were English books , Faber & Faber and Victor Gollancz , books with purely typographical jackets and cloth - covered boards warping from the damp of their trans -Atlantic passage , and art books , too glossy and expensive even to glance into , and of course New Directions books , modest in format and delicious in their unread content .
After Harvard , I went to Oxford for a year , and browsed for dazed hours in the rambling treasury , on the street called the Broad , of Blackwell 's — shelves of Everyman 's and Oxford Classics , and the complete works , jacketed in baby - blue paper , of Thomas Aquinas , in Latin and English !
Then I came to New York , when Fifth Avenue still seemed lined with bookstores — the baronial Scribner 's , with the central staircase and the scrolled ironwork of its balconies , and the Doubleday 's a few blocks on , with an ascending spiral staircase visible through plate glass .
Now I live in a village - like corner of a small New England city that holds , mirabile dictu , an independent bookstore , one of the few surviving in the long coastal stretch between Marblehead and Newburyport .
But I live , it seems , in a fool 's paradise .
Last month ,
The New York Times Magazine published a lengthy article that gleefully envisioned the end of the bookseller , and indeed of the writer .
Written by Kevin Kelly , identified as the " senior maverick " at Wired magazine , the article describes a glorious digitalizing of all written knowledge .
Google 's plan , announced in December 2004 , to scan the contents of five major research libraries and make them searchable , according to Kelly , has resurrected the dream of the universal library .
" The explosive rise of the Web , going from nothing to everything in one decade , " he writes , " has encouraged us to believe in the impossible again .
Might the long - heralded great library of all knowledge really be within our grasp ? "
When the NSA wiretapping story first hit the pages of the NYT a few days ago , there were clearly a huge number of unanswered questions .
Is the wiretapping that the President has authorized illegal under the FISA act ?
Is it unconstitutional ?
If it 's illegal , does the President have the authority to violate the law if he 's acting in the best interests of the republic ?
And then there 's the question of why the NYT sat on this story for over a year before going public with it .
I 'm not really going to make any attempt to answer questions of legality and constitutionality , because the Internet is full of armchair constitutional scholars right now who 're fighting tooth and nail over these questions , generating much heat but very little light .
Instead , I 'd like to point your attention to some later developments in this case that clearly indicate that there 's much more going on here than we initially assumed .
When the truth comes out ( if it ever does ) , this NSA wiretapping story will almost certainly be a story not just about the Constitutional concept of the separation of powers , but about high technology .
To return to the last question in the first paragraph , let 's take a look at the NYT 's own answer .
The quotes below are from NYT executive editor Bill Keller 's statement on the matter :
A year ago , when this information first became known to Times reporters , the Administration argued strongly that writing about this eavesdropping program would give terrorists clues about the vulnerability of their communications and would deprive the government of an effective tool for the protection of the country 's security ...
As we have done before in rare instances when faced with a convincing national security argument , we agreed not to publish at that time .
" We also continued reporting , and in the ensuing months two things happened that changed our thinking ...
Second , in the course of subsequent reporting we satisfied ourselves that we could write about this program -- withholding a number of technical details -- in a way that would not expose any intelligence - gathering methods or capabilities that are not already on the public record .
( Emphasis in the above quote and in all subsequent quotes is added . )
So the NYT sat on this story for a year in part because they were concerned that they would n't be able to report it without revealing some crucial technical details of how the program works .
Now let 's take a look a statement of former senator Bob Graham ( D - FL ) , who was one of the few senators to be briefed on the program .
From a new Washington Post article :
" I came out of the room with the full sense that we were dealing with a change in technology but not policy , " Graham said , with new opportunities to intercept overseas calls that passed through U.S. switches .
Kevin Drum at the Washington Monthly has rounded up a few more quotes like those above ( including the NYT quote ) , that also help make a very good case that what 's at issue here is some kind of new NSA surveillance technology :
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , telling reporters why Bush did n't simply ask Congress to pass a law making the program clearly legal : " We've had discussions with members of Congress , certain members of Congress , about whether or not we could get an amendment to FISA , and we were advised that that was not likely to be ?
that was not something we could likely get , certainly not without jeopardizing the existence of the program , and therefore , killing the program . "
President Bush , answering questions at Monday 's press conference : " We use FISA still ....
But FISA is for long - term monitoring .... There is a difference between detecting so we can prevent , and monitoring .
And it 's important to know the distinction between the two .... We used the [ FISA ] process to monitor .
But also .... we 've got to be able to detect and prevent . "
Senator Jay Rockefeller , in a letter to Dick Cheney after being briefed on the program in 2003 : " As I reflected on the meeting today , and the future we face , John Poindexter 's TIA project sprung to mind , exacerbating my concern regarding the direction the Administration is moving with regard to security , technology , and surveillance . "
This last quote above , the one about TIA , is especially telling .
TIA was a massive electronic intelligence gathering program designed to mechanically sift through phone calls , emails , and other electronic communications in order to build pictures of how individuals fit into larger networks .
We covered TIA here on Ars , but of all the coverage I think Caesar 's initial take on it seems the most directly applicable to the current situation :
This system 's purpose would be to monitor communications and detect would - be terrorists and plots before they happen ...
This project is not interested in funding " evolutionary " changes in technology , e.g. , bit - step improvements to current data mining and storage techniques .
Rather , the amount of data that the directors are anticipating ( petabytes ! ) would require massive leaps in technology ( and perhaps also some massive leaps in surveillance laws ) .
According to DARPA , such data collection " increases information coverage by an order of magnitude , " and ultimately " requires keeping track of individuals and understanding how they fit into models . "
" Massive leaps in surveillance laws " indeed .
TIA became public in 2002 , and Congress quickly put the kibosh on it .
This is right about the time that Bush secretly signed the executive order authorizing the new NSA wiretap program .
So , are TIA and the NSA wiretapping directive related ?
That probably depends on what you mean by " related . "
I doubt seriously they 're the same thing , but it 's entirely possible that the undescribed new technology used in the NSA wiretapping program was also going to be deployed as a part of TIA 's massive data collection efforts .
My main point in bringing up TIA is twofold : 1 ) TIA - like efforts are still going on ( Defensetech catalogs some ) , and 2 ) the government has been trying to use new technology , like database tech and voice recognition , for domestic surveillance for a long time .
And when I say a long time , I mean well before the current administration came into office .
The domestic electronic surveillance ball really got rolling under the Clinton administration , with the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ( CALEA ) .
CALEA mandated that the telcos aid wiretapping by installing remote wiretap ports onto their digital switches so that the switch traffic would be available for snooping by law enforcement .
After CALEA passed , the FBI no longer had to go on - site with wiretapping equipment in order to tap a line they could monitor and digitally process voice communications from the comfort of the home office .
( The FCC has recently ruled that CALEA covers VOIP services , which means that providers like Vonage will have to find a way to comply . )
CALEA opened up a huge can of worms , and PGP creator Phil Zimmermann sounded the alarm back in 1999 about where the program was headed :
A year after the CALEA passed , the FBI disclosed plans to require the phone companies to build into their infrastructure the capacity to simultaneously wiretap 1 percent of all phone calls in all major U.S. cities .
This would represent more than a thousandfold increase over previous levels in the number of phones that could be wiretapped .
In previous years , there were only about a thousand court - ordered wiretaps in the United States per year , at the federal , state , and local levels combined .
It 's hard to see how the government could even employ enough judges to sign enough wiretap orders to wiretap 1 percent of all our phone calls , much less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that traffic in real time .
The only plausible way of processing that amount of traffic is a massive Orwellian application of automated voice recognition technology to sift through it all , searching for interesting keywords or searching for a particular speaker 's voice .
If the government does n't find the target in the first 1 percent sample , the wiretaps can be shifted over to a different 1 percent until the target is found , or until everyone 's phone line has been checked for subversive traffic .
The FBI said they need this capacity to plan for the future .
This plan sparked such outrage that it was defeated in Congress .
But the mere fact that the FBI even asked for these broad powers is revealing of their agenda .
Read the quote above carefully , and see if it does n't ring any bells for you .
The salient points that Zimmermann makes are these :
In 1995 , back when the Pentium Pro was hot stuff , the FBI requested the legal authorization to do very high - volume monitoring of digital calls .
There 's no way for the judicial system to approve warrants for the number of calls that the FBI wanted to monitor .
The agency could never hire enough humans to be able to monitor that many calls simultaneously , which means that they'd have to use voice recognition technology to look for " hits " that they could then follow up on with human wiretaps .
It is entirely possible that the NSA technology at issue here is some kind of high - volume , automated voice recognition and pattern matching system .
Now , I do n't at all believe that all international calls are or could be monitored with such a system , or anything like that .
Rather , the NSA could very easily narrow down the amount of phone traffic that they'd have to a relatively small fraction of international calls with some smart filtering .
First , they 'd only monitor calls where one end of the connection is in a country of interest .
Then , they 'd only need the ability to do a roving random sample of a few seconds from each call in that already greatly narrowed pool of calls .
As Zimmermann describes above , you monitor a few seconds of some fraction of the calls looking for " hits , " and then you move on to another fraction .
If a particular call generates a hit , then you zero in on it for further real - time analysis and possible human interception .
All the calls can be recorded , cached , and further examined later for items that may have been overlooked in the real - time analysis .
In a recent press conference , Deputy Director for National Intelligence Michael Hayden said the following ( via Defensetech ) :
And here the key is not so much persistence as it is agility .
It 's a quicker trigger .
It 's a subtly softer trigger .
And the intrusion into privacy -- the intrusion into privacy is significantly less .
It 's only international calls .
The period of time in which we do this is , in most cases , far less than that which would be gained by getting a court order .
This sounds pretty much like what I 've described above .
And yes , this kind of real - time voice recognition , crude semantic parsing and pattern matching is doable with today 's technology , especially when you have a budget like the NSA .
The " softer trigger " here is a phrase that 's on a watch list , or a call with an abnormally high volume of a certain type of vocabulary .
The " agility " bit is a reference to the technology 's ability to move from call to call , taking small slices .
That 's also probably what 's behind the claim that the technology is less intrusive than a traditional wiretap , because the time slices are very short .
Finally , I know a lot of people are bringing up Echelon here , and Echelon is indeed relevant .
However , the relevance is n't in how the NSA program is connected to Echelon it probably is n't but in the fact that Echelon is yet another example of a government - run , high - volume , automated intelligence gathering project that looks for certain words or phrases in samples of electronic communications .
Addendum : Looking back over this post and discussing it with some non-techie friends of mine , I can see that folks who are n't regular
Ars readers may mistake this for some sort of defense of the administration 's activities .
For the record , I 'm one of those " privacy nazis " that people like Michelle Malkin love to hate , and I view any kind of domestic spying -- automated or not -- with hostility .
But aside from my general ( and genuinely conservative ) knee - jerk anti-government reactions against this program , there 's an even deeper criticism that can be leveled against casting such a wide , computer - automated net .
I 've posted this criticism as a followup post , so read on for more .
Record labels often specify DRM on their downloaded music
A Public Affair by Jessica Simpson does not have any digital rights management ( DRM ) restrictions often found on tracks from other sites .
The MP3 is compatible with any digital music player , including Apple 's popular iPod player and others .
The major record labels and technology firms have long argued that DRM is necessary to prevent music piracy .
Files without copy protection , they argue , can be freely shared or traded over peer - to - peer networks .
Locked in
The record industry says that file sharing is a key factor in the decline in record sales in recent years .
Most major labels insist on some form of DRM on music offered through download services .
DRM systems can include special formats for media files or proprietary media players .
I hope it's the beginning of a significant movement from them
Suw Charman , Open Rights Group
For instance , people buying tracks from the iTunes store cannot move tracks on to non-Apple portable music devices .
Others restrict the number of times a user can copy a file .
Yahoo does not agree .
On the official Yahoo music blog , director of product management Ian Rogers wrote : " As you know , we 've been publicly trying to convince record labels that they should be selling MP3s for a while now .
" Our position is simple : DRM does n't add any value for the artist , label ( who are selling DRM - free music every day - the Compact Disc ) , or consumer , the only people it adds value to are the technology companies who are interested in locking consumers to a particular technology platform . "
Dave Goldberg , the vice president and general manager of Yahoo Music urged record labels reconsider their stance on DRM technology earlier this year .
Other companies , such as Wippit and eMusic , already offer MP3 files that can be freely shared .
However much of the music is from independent labels .
' Leap forward '
The release of the Jessica Simpson track from Sony BMG represents the first tentative steps by a major label to release a track without copy protection .
It marks a reversal for Sony BMG who were criticised last year when they released their XCP anti-piracy software on music CDs .
People who buy the track can copy it on to any digital music player
This system used virus - like techniques to hide itself and stop CDs being copied .
The row over the software ended up in the US courts .
The new track , costing $ 1.99 ( £ 1.07 ) , can be personalised before the song is downloaded , allowing users to have their name inserted in the lyrics .
Suw Charman , executive director of the digital advocacy body the Open Rights Group says the experiment is " clearly a gimmick " but still a significant move .
" It 's an important experiment , " she said .
" I hope it 's the beginning of a significant movement from them [ Yahoo ] . "
" It sends a strong message about not having to have DRM on everything . "
People who responded to the announcement on the Yahoo blog agreed .
" This is a huge leap forward for the music industry .
I can't think of one consumer who is OK with DRM , " wrote one respondent .
" I 'm not into Jessica Simpson or the personalisation idea , but I 'm very into the non-DRM idea , " said another .
Yahoo have not confirmed whether they will release more unprotected music tracks .
It was one of those unpredictable Lebanese Sunday mornings .
The ski slopes in the mountains overlooking Beirut would have been crowded with skiers enjoying the brilliant winter sunshine .
Walkers were out along the Corniche , strolling in designer tracksuits .
Downtown , the chic restaurants were preparing for lunchtime .
And there were a few men on scooters riding around town broadcasting an imminent protest .
It was n't long before the heavily - laden coaches and minivans began to arrive from Beirut and the rest of Lebanon .
They were all full of young , often bearded men who wore headbands and carried identical flags with calligraphic inscriptions in Arabic such as : " There is no god but God and Mohammad is his Prophet " and " O Nation of Muhammad , Wake Up . "
There were soon as many as 20,000 of them filling the streets .
They walked up past the Christian quarter of Gemmayze and into the even more genteel Christian area of Achrafieh , gathering not far from the Danish embassy , the target of their protest .
One man waved a placard in English that said : " Damn your beliefs and your liberty . "
Another carried a sign saying : " Whoever insults Prophet Muhammad is to be killed . "
The police seemed to know the demonstrators were coming and had turned out in force with barriers , barbed wire fences and several large fire trucks .
Just a day earlier , the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Damascus had been torched by a furious mob , repeating the violent protests that have spread across the world from Gaza to Afghanistan to London .
On Saturday night , anticipating trouble , the Danish diplomatic staff in Beirut flew home .
The mob stood in the street , chanting their fierce condemnation of the Danish cartoons that spawned this rapidly - spreading crisis .
By 11 am , the Lebanese police and army were firing tear gas at the crowd .
The protesters threw volleys of stones .
Some stuffed cotton wool into their nostrils to stifle the effect of the gas .
One group overturned a car and set it alight .
Sunni clerics in robes tried to calm the young men down .
They were ignored .
One cleric , Ibrahim Ibrahim , said his pleas were met with stones and insults .
" They are hooligans , " he said .
The mob grew fiercer , and finally the police withdrew .
As they moved back , the crowd smashed their way into the building housing the Danish embassy and set it ablaze .
From the burning building they hung a banner that read : " We are ready to sacrifice our children for you , O Prophet Muhammad . "
By now dozens of people had been wounded or arrested and at least one person was killed , a protester apparently caught up in the fire at the embassy building .
The many politicians representing Lebanon 's fractured sectarian society sensed this was suddenly a situation a long way out of control .
" It is the work of infiltrators , " said Saiad Hariri , a prominent Sunni politician .
" These acts have nothing to do with the Prophet .
They are harming Muslims . "
On the street , the riot began to take a more sectarian turn .
Throwing the metal barriers and barbed wire aside they chased the police up into the narrow alleys of Achrafieh , well beyond the embassy and deep into the Christian quarter .
They smashed dozens of parked cars and tossed bricks through the windows of the furniture boutiques and hair salons .
Others overturned two police cars and threw rocks through the windows of the St Maron church .
" What is the guilt of the citizens of Achrafieh for caricatures published in Denmark ? " said Charles Rizk , the justice minister and a Christian .
" This sabotage should stop . "
Asad Harmoush , a leader of Jamaía Islamiya , the conservative Sunni Muslim group that had helped organise the protest , tried to deflect the blame .
" We can't control tens of thousands of people .
We tried to limit the harm and we extend our excuses to our brothers in Achrafieh and to the security forces .
There has to be an investigation .
Obviously there were infiltrators . "
And then in the early afternoon , as suddenly as it had all begun , it ended .
The leaders of the mob turned to the angry young men beside them and told them it was time to leave .
Obediently the crowd thinned out and began walking back to the buses , even as the Danish embassy continued to burn .
By 3 pm there was n't a single protester left on the street .
Later , the Lebanese interior minister , Hassan Sabei , announced his resignation .
The police returned in force , and with nothing to do they began taking photographs of each other in front of the burned - out building .
Firemen hosed down the blaze .
Crowds of Filipino maids returned from their day off back to their jobs in the homes of the wealthy , while the wealthy were out patching up their cars .
Dozens of street sweepers hosed down the roads and collected the debris of the day .
I ’ll make this clear from the start : I ’m really a Dreamweaver guy .
But with all the posturing Microsoft has been doing on the web design / development against Adobe lately , I ca n’t help but be curious about what the Expression Web Designer can offer the web designer .
Does MS Expression Web Designer have the goods to sway the Dreamweaver crowd ?
I downloaded the beta version of MS Expression Web Designer ( EWD ) and installed it on my PC .
Here are my impressions of this application :
The User Interface
Once I got EWD up and running in WYSIWYG , I felt I was using MS Word .
Its interface is very true to any MS application– front the look and feel to the interactions .
As a Dreamweaver user , I ’ve gotten used to its interface and I appreciate the difference in my use of DW and Word .
EWD has extensive drag - and - drop features .
You can insert form elements , html tags and visual components using that method .
VB developers will probably like this but it may take some gettting used to if you ’re a Dreamweaver designer .
The Code View in Dreamweaver is superior in my opinion .
The default code coloring in EWD is something I do n’t like .
However , the Intellisense feature in EWD is top - notch .
Using the Application
The Help windows took forever to load .
ASP.NET is the only server - side scripting langauge supported by EWD ( Surprise ! )
So much for doing PHP / Ruby on Rails development .
There are built - in ASP.
NET components that can be inserted via drag - and - drop .
Although Dreamweaver has some pre-built components , the use of drag and drop is a appeals to the lazy , ehem , smart coder in me .
There is a thesaurus feature in the editor !
I like this feature very much .
Saves me time from switching from DW to Word when writing web copy .
You will need a map to get to the Template feature .
Web Standards
CSS is handled very well in EWD .
This is one aspect that Dreamweaver guys will like .
Style management is clean and efficient .
Editing a style brings you to the code and panel view , so you can choose where to tweak your CSS .
Formatting of components already is defined in to the webpage stylesheet by default .
Nice .
EWD puts a premium in the use of tables .
It has a control pane exclusively for layout using tables .
it even has a separate menu item for tables .
The standardista in me just wants to scream .
Although I did try this application in its Beta phase , it ’s pretty much sufficient .
From Frontpage to this applications is a quantum leap on its own .
However , I think Microsoft Expression Web Designer does n’t not have what it takes to get Dreamweaver users to switch based on features alone .
A member of the public discovered the remains in a back alley in the Anfield area of Liverpool .
Police cordoned off the scene but soon realised that it was not a human but a chicken foetus .
Well - wishers had laid more than a dozen bunches of flowers at the scene , along with cards and teddy bears .
Local gossip
One of the cards read : " RIP Little Baby .
Safe in the arms of Jesus .
From someone who is a loving mother xxxx . "
Merseyside Police told the community on Monday to " stop grieving , it 's only a chicken " .
A spokeswoman for Merseyside Police said : " It seems a member of the public saw the remains of a foetus , which possibly resembled a human foetus , and called us .
" We cordoned off the area to investigate , as we would with any possible suspicious death , but it became apparent it was not a human foetus .
" The flowers and cards are obviously the result of local gossip , but we can assure people that the remains were not human . "
Conservative MP and editor of The Spectator Boris Johnson was criticised last year after commenting in the magazine that Liverpudlians were " hooked on grief " .
When I first tried to locate the Catholic monk David Steindl - Rast in late 1999 , I was told he was living as a hermit now ; no one knew exactly where .
I plugged his name into an internet search engine , and it came up associated with a monastery in western New York called Mount Saviour .
When I contacted the monastery , a monk told me that Brother David visited now and then but no longer lived there ; he was living in seclusion in another town .
The monk gave me a fax number that Brother David sometimes responded to .
I faxed a letter to the number telling Steindl - Rast about my mysticism - book project and asking for an interview .
No response .
I faxed him again .
Nothing .
Finally I sent another , longer letter .
I said that after reading his works , I thought he might be able to help me come to terms with some questions I ’d been wrestling with — namely , why , if God exists , has He created such a painful world ?
About an hour later , I received a hand - written fax from " Your brother David . "
After thanking me for my " gentle persistence , " he said , " At this time in my life , I live in seclusion .
An interview will not work . "
He offered to answer a few " strongly focused " questions by email , however .
He gave me an email address whose tag was " hermit , " and we began a sporadic electronic communication .
Steindl - Rast eventually agreed to meet me after all — not at his hermitage but at Mount Saviour , which he planned to visit for the Feast of the Pentecost .
Thus did I finally arrange to meet the elusive Brother David .
Born and raised in Austria , he emigrated to the United States in 1952 and joined the Benedictine order shortly thereafter .
He came to be seen as a successor to the Trappist monk and mystic Thomas Merton .
Like Merton , Steindl - Rast sought to revive interest in prayer and contemplation as ways to arouse spiritual awareness .
He also participated in exchange programs between Catholic and Buddhist monks .
Steindl - Rast seems to impress all who encounter him .
Both the transpersonal psychologist Francis Vaughan and the human potential guru Jean Houston told me that Steindl - Rast impressed them as a true mystic , and one of the most saintly people they had ever met .
Frank Geer , an Episcopalian minister in my home town , remembered vividly a workshop he took with Steindl - Rast in the 1970 ’s ; Steindl - Rast had been wise , warm , funny , everything one could want in a spiritual teacher .
I heard similar stories from others .
Reading Steindl - Rast ’s books , I could see why people found him so appealing .
His was a path of the heart more than the intellect .
His spirituality consisted of two qualities , wonder and gratitude .
Our amazement that anything exists at all is the wellspring of philosophy , science , and spirituality , Steindl - Rast said .
" What catapults our awareness to a higher level , " he wrote , " is our capacity for surprise . "
He summed up this view with the phrase , " God is surprise . "
Life is also a gift , Steindl - Rast said , for which we should be profoundly grateful .
He suggested daily exercises for nurturing our spiritual amazement and gratitude : reading and pondering one poem a day ; focusing on one of the senses ; giving thanks each day for at least one thing you have not been grateful for before .
Steindl - Rast did not shy away from the problems posed by a spirituality founded on gratitude .
How can we be grateful , he asked , when there are so many wrongs in the world ?
When people are being massacred in Africa and going hungry in India ?
When companies are polluting the environment ?
One answer , he suggested , is that we can be grateful for the opportunity to do something about these problems .
Also , we should be grateful not just for the good in our own lives — or in life in general -- but for the bad as well .
This is a truly spiritual gratitude , which affirms all aspects of life .
" To give thanks even when we can not see the goodness of the Giver - - to learn this is to find the path to peace of heart .
For happiness is not what makes us grateful .
It is gratefulness that makes us happy . "
If we can be grateful even when things seem bleakest , then we may know true joy , " a happiness that does n’t depend on what happens . "
There are dark notes in Steindl - Rast ’s writings that keep it from slipping into sentimentality .
In Music of Silence , he mentioned the Biblical story of Jacob , who was both blessed and crippled by his encounter with an angel .
" There is a mysterious woundedness that somehow goes with great blessing , " Steindl - Rast wrote .
" When we truly encounter the night in all its beauty and terror , we have no assurance whatsoever that we are going to come out unscathed . "
Steindl - Rast questioned whether it is possible to extinguish all pain and be " fully alive and present in the now . "
He told a tale about a young monk who travels into the desert to seek out a revered old master .
The young monk finally finds the master and asks for advice on how to achieve permanent peace of mind .
The old man answers , " I have worn this habit for seventy years and not on a single day have I found peace . "
I traveled to meet Brother David on a sultry Saturday in June 2000 .
After crossing the Hudson River , I drove west for three hours to Elmira , New York .
Turning onto the monastery road just beyond the town , I drove past a sloping pasture dotted with sheep ( the monastery sells lamb wool and meat ) to a compound of white - painted buildings .
A monk at the reception desk showed me to my room in a guest house .
The room was spartan : bed , chair , writing desk .
On the desk was a note : " Welcome , John , and blessings on your stay here .
See you at supper .
David . "
I had more than an hour to kill .
Wandering down the hall from the room , I found a roomed lined with books on theology .
One caught my eye : The Problem of Evil , volume 20 of the Twentieth Century Encyclopedia of Catholicism .
Flipping it open , I read : " For every thinking and reflecting man the existence of evil is a riddle he cannot escape . "
Although the world seems to be designed by a " wonderful intelligence , " the existence of so much suffering and cruelty makes us ask , " How can God allow this ? "
The author proposed a " provisional , but valid and complete , solution to this problem . "
Without pain and evil , we would not know the rapture of being saved by God .
This notion is expressed by a passage sung by the deacon during the Easter vigil : " O happy fault to win for us so great and so mighty a Redeemer . "
In other words , evil is a necessary evil .
The author rejected the suggestion of Marxists and scientists that material progress will eventually eradicate evil .
Evil " will persist throughout eternity , " he declared cheerfully , so God can keep saving us .
When I entered the monastery ’s dining hall , along with eight other lay male guests , nine monks were already taking their seats .
I recognized Steindl - Rast from his photographs .
He was standing behind his chair , his eyes downcast .
I approached him with my hand outstretched , identifying myself and expressing delight at finally meeting him .
He shook my hand and smiled but said nothing .
He seemed half embarrassed , half amused .
Another monk took me firmly by the arm and steered me to the other side of the room , where the guests sat .
We sat in silence , monks on one side of the room , lay men on the other .
The monks came in all ages and sizes .
They ranged from a painfully thin , sallow young fellow to an obese old man wearing an eye patch and slouching in a wheelchair .
The male guests were similarly varied .
On one side of me was a 20 - ish , goateed hipster , on the other a fit , crewcutted gent who looked like a retired military officer .
A grizzled monk in a green apron wheeled out a food - laden cart and served us dinner : chowder , pineapple , bread , milk and apple juice .
As we ate , silverware scraping against our metal bowls and plates , a monk in a pulpit at the other end of the hall droningly read snippets from the Bible and other religious texts .
At the end of the meal , Steindl - Rast approached me and asked if I minded helping out with the dishes .
Not at all , I replied .
When the dishes were washed , Steindl - Rast led me outside to the cross - shaped chapel that was the compound ’s centerpiece .
We sat in two rusty metal chairs just outside the chapel , looking out across a dusky landscape of woods and fields .
In a German - accented voice Steindl - Rast told me that he always marveled at how much this landscape had changed since he first arrived here in 1953 .
He and his fellow monks had planted almost all the trees before us , about 50,000 trees in all .
How big they had grown !
He was lean , almost gaunt , with close - cropped hair and beard .
Thick black eyebrows hung like awnings over his eyes .
He gave off an aura of calm and repose tinged with mischief .
As he spoke , his hands emerged from his black over - robe , fluttered and swooped before him like birds , and vanished beneath the robe again , as if resting .
A ring of beads circled the middle finger of his right hand .
The only part of him that looked his age , 75 , were his battered , sandal - shod feet .
I spoke to Steindl - Rast for more than an hour that evening and again the following morning , in between several of the eight services that take place each day in the monastery chapel .
He told me that he had been 12 when Germany usurped Austria .
He was forced to serve in the German Army during the war but never saw combat .
Just before the war ended , he deserted and made his way home , and his mother hid him for several months before Germany surrendered .
After the war , he had friends , a girlfriend , a wonderful life .
" Everything was just absolutely perfect , " he said .
" It was at that point , when I was happiest of all my life so to speak , at least up to then , that I realized that from here on it could only go downhill — unless I kept death before my eyes . "
I looked at him , puzzled , and he explained that the phrase " keep death at all times before your eyes " came from Saint Benedict , the founder of his order .
Steindl - Rast first encountered Benedict ’s teachings toward the end of the war , when he started frequenting a Benedictine church .
Steindl - Rast realized that his sense of death ’s nearness during the war had made him truly appreciate life .
Many of his closest friends had been killed , and Steindl - Rast had not expected to see his twentieth birthday , but even in the worst of times he was strangely happy , even joyful .
When the war ended , he became convinced that if he did not sustain his awareness of death , the rest of his life would be anti-climactic .
One day in church he had an epiphany in which he realized that monasticism was his destiny ; after all , the purpose of monasticism is to cultivate a heightened awareness of death and life .
He resisted his calling for another seven years , during which he obtained a doctorate in child psychology .
In 1952 , he emigrated with his mother and two brothers to the United States .
Soon after his arrival he heard about a Benedictine monastery that had just been founded in western New York , near the town of Elmira .
Steindl - Rast took a bus to the new - born Mount Saviour monastery and immediately felt that he belonged there .
Many monks - in - training agonize over whether to embrace monasticism .
Not Steindl - Rast .
" I liked everything about it from the very first day . "
In the 1960 ’s , at the urging of his prior , Steindl - Rast began leaving the monastery to give talks on monastic life at universities and other locales .
He participated in the so - called " house of prayer " movement , in which Catholics sought to renew their faith through prayer and other spiritual practices .
He traveled around the world giving lectures on spirituality , and for several years he taught at Esalen .
I told Steindl - Rast that it sounded like a concept for a television sit-com : a celibate monk teaching at Esalen , ground zero of the sexual revolution .
Smiling , he replied that he applauded the exploration of sexuality that occurred at Esalen .
He even taught a workshop called " The Pleasure of Touching and the Joy of Being Touched . "
True spirituality , he said , embraces sensuality .
Although monasticism is usually seen as anti-sensual , Steindl - Rast added , it actually enhances our sensuality .
Just as food tastes better to a hungry man , so does the monk have a heightened appreciation of reality .
During this period Steindl - Rast tried psychedelics , or entheogens , as he preferred to called them .
For the most part , his entheogenic experiences merely reinforced perceptions and insights he had already gleaned from his contemplative practice .
" It was n’t this world - shaking experience . "
What a friend once said of psychedelics held for him too : " I do n’t need for the rocks to yell at me .
I always speak with them anyway . "
He nonetheless concluded that entheogens can be helpful , particularly for those whose spirituality is too intellectual .
" If you always read about swimming , it ’s a good idea to jump into the water once in a while .
There is something you just ca n’t get out of books , not even out of the Bible . "
It was obvious by this point that Steindl - Rast is not a conventional Catholic .
He excoriated the Catholic church , calling it too centralized , authoritarian , sexist , " the last absolute monarchy left in the world . "
The church in its present incarnation is " doomed to die " as a result of its rigidity .
Steindl - Rast chose not to become an ordained priest in part so that he would not be part of the church hierarchy ; as a monk with no flock , he is freer to speak his mind .
He hoped the church would soon allow women to serve as priests .
But ultimately , Catholics should not require churches , priests or any of the institutional trappings of worship .
Steindl - Rast recalled Jesus ’s declaration that " wherever two or three are together in my name , I am in the midst of them . "
He envisioned a day when Catholics celebrate mass , carry out baptisms and marry in their own homes .
I asked why we need Catholicism or any religion to sustain our spirituality .
Ca n’t art serve the same function in a more benign fashion ?
Steindl - Rast gave me the same response to this question that Huston Smith did .
Art is a vital component of Catholicism , Steindl - Rast pointed out .
" Look at the cathedrals !
Look at the liturgy !
I feel like an opera singer who has the privilege to sing every day , and dance .
It ’s not elaborate , but it ’s real dancing and singing .
This is art . "
Those who want to reform the church should emphasize these elements rather than theological doctrine .
" That is what we should focus on and should cultivate and develop into the future . "
Steindl - Rast seemed more personally committed to monasticism than to Catholicism per se .
When Steindl - Rast first met Buddhist monks , he said , he felt an instant bond with them .
Eventually , with the permission of the Vatican , he left his monastery to spend time at Zen monasteries in New York City , California and elsewhere .
He felt as at home in these Zendos as he had at Mount Savior .
" Sometimes I had to almost pull my ear to become aware that I was not in a Christian monastery , " he said .
" It was just another way of doing the same thing , being in an environment where everything is geared toward mindfulness . "
Theology was another matter .
When a Zen monk spent several days at Mount Savior , he and the Christian monks could find no common theological ground .
" Every time he opened his mouth he put his foot in it , " Steindl - Rast said .
smiling .
But monastic life is about spirituality rather than theology , " so we met on the level of spirituality , not theology . "
Monastic spirituality is a gem , he said , that can shine in many different settings .
Perhaps the most significant difference between Christian and Buddhist monasticism is the attitude toward mystical experience .
Christian monasticism has traditionally paid little attention to mystical states .
When Steindl - Rast became a monk in the 1950’s , " if you had said you had had a mystic experience , they would have kicked you out immediately , " he said , laughing .
" The rumor would have gotten around , and you would n’t have gotten into any other monastery either . "
Buddhism inspired Christian monks such as Thomas Merton and Steindl - Rast to pay closer attention to their subjective experiences .
In his autobiography , Merton recalled that while crossing a street in Louisville , Kentucky , he felt a visceral connection to all the men and women around him .
Steindl - Rast had a similar
Thou - art - that epiphany while he was living in New York City .
Walking down the street , he looked in the faces of people passing by him and thought , " That ’s me , that ’s me , that ’s me . "
The sense of recognition was uncannily similar to what he felt when he spotted himself in a group photograph .
Although experiences like these fade in intensity and immediacy , the insights they yield remain .
" Once you have seen that , you ca n’t deny it any more . "
But monastic life involves not mystical experiences per se , Steindl - Rast emphasized , but " keeping your mind on essential things , and not just your mind but your heart . "
For the past several years , Steindl - Rast had been living alone in a cottage on a Quaker retreat .
After so many years of traveling , he felt that he needed to catch up on his solitude .
He hoped to stay in touch with the world through an interactive website that would encourage people from any and all faiths to explore the spiritual benefits of cultivating gratefulness .
The theme of his site would be that " it does n’t make a difference whether you are Christian or Buddhist or Hindu or Sufi .
Whatever you are , gratefulness is at the root of your spirituality . "
The website ’s address would be gratefulness.org , Steindl - Rast said , his smile acknowledging the incongruity of it all .
I told Steindl - Rast about my reluctance to thank or even acknowledge the existence of a God that allows innocent people to suffer so much .
Steindl - Rast admitted that he was stumped by that ancient theological conundrum too .
" That is a question one really has to grapple with , " he said .
" I do not know the answer .
I wish I knew it . "
Steindl - Rast said that a passage in the Hebrew Bible suggests one possible theodicy .
In this passage , God declared , " I am with you in your troubles . "
That line , Steindl - Rast suggested , could be interpreted to mean that God is not an omnipotent savior , who at any moment can deliver us from the plight that He has put us into ; in some way God shares our suffering and our struggles .
" God is in trouble , " Steindl - Rast said .
" And we do n’t like that very much .
We want to have at least somebody who is not in trouble . "
But Steindl - Rast seemed reluctant to dwell on the imperfections of God or His creation .
He told me a story in which Saint Anthony asked God why He permitted so much suffering .
God replied , " Let me take care of that .
You take care of Anthony . "
The story expresses the faith that " if God is God , then probably She knows better , " Steindl - Rast explained , lifting his eyebrows and smiling as he said " she . "
Rather than despairing at the world ’s pain and injustice , Steindl - Rast said , we should be grateful that we have the opportunity to make the world better .
" Then you are doing what you can do , and what more do you want ?
Set yourself up as a judge of life , that it should be better ?
If you are grateful , that ’s a different attitude . "
This Catholic monk was telling me the same thing that the neurologist and Zen Buddhist James Austin did : Forget all this theology .
Yes , the world is unjust and painful , but there is much we can do to reduce the pain and injustice .
At the very least , we can offer each other compassion .
But as painful as existence is , he said , it also offers much to be grateful for .
The best way to overcome our despair over the inevitability of suffering and death is to give thanks for all that is good in life .
Gratefulness " fills this whole present moment .
And then comes the next moment , and that process fills the next moment .
You do n’t have time , so to say , to think , ‘ What if there is no next moment ? ’ "
Steindl - Rast said he did not have much interest in life after death .
" I feel more comfortable thinking of death as that after which by definition there is nothing , there is no ‘ after . ’"
In fact , the knowledge that one day his life would end filled him with relief rather than dread .
" I am very happy not to have to think of more time after that , just as I am very happy when my day is done and I can go to bed and that day is over , " he said .
" I am not too eager to have somebody tell me that some other thing is coming after and after and after . "
Steindl - Rast viewed heaven and hell not as places we go after death but as states that we dwell in here on earth .
If heaven means embracing life and being embraced by it , hell is alienation from life .
" One example that I ’ve used , and that many people can identify with , is the childrens ’ party where you find yourself sulking in a corner .
Everybody is having a great time ; only you do n’t .
And you have forgotten how you ever got in this corner , but you do n’t want to come out .
Somehow you are saving face by not coming out .
And finally somebody cracks a joke and makes you spray your cocoa and makes it come out your nose .
And all of a sudden you are laughing and back in with the rest of them .
That state was a hellish state , because , as C.S. Lewis says , ‘ God does n’t lock anybody up in hell .
The doors of hell are locked up on the inside . ’ "
Our alienation from life may take more extreme forms , Steindl - Rast acknowledged .
" I have a very close friend who always says , ‘ Do n’t forget the nadir experiences . ’
They are also peaks , but upside - down peaks . "
When I asked if he had ever had experiences of this kind , Steindl - Rast told me in a surprisingly matter - of - fact manner that ever since his youth he had suffered from bouts of severe depression , which usually lasted no more than a few days .
These episodes were so utterly unlike his ordinary states of mind that when they passed he had difficulty recalling their content .
" You can only remember it was awful , " he said .
These depressive episodes reminded him of beautiful beetles that he had found as a child in the Austrian Alps .
When it was right - side up , the beetle looked like a living gem , with burnished golden - green wings .
But flipped over it was a thicket of scrabbling black legs .
In the same way , " this beautiful life here has an underside , and it ’s pretty awful . "
He now took medication to treat his depression .
The memory of better times also helped him through his darkest moments .
" Even in these worst times , there is an underlying sense of everything is all right , " he said , " which I trace back to those moments in which I knew that the last word is ‘ yes ’ and not ‘ no . ’ "
Steindl - Rast spoke very quietly , almost in a whisper .
Bats were flitting across the dimming sky when the chapel bell rang , calling us to Compline , the last service of the day .
I followed Steindl - Rast into the chapel .
He sat with the other monks on one side of the chapel .
I sat on the other side with the lay visitors , including not only the men I had eaten with earlier but women and children , too .
The prior rapped the side of his pew sharply .
As one monk strummed a harp , the others sang a hymn .
The combination of the harp and human voices and twilight atmosphere put me in a dreamy , trance - like mood .
After several songs , the prior rapped his pew again .
He and the other monks rose and disappeared down a staircase .
I and the other lay folk trooped after the monks , and we assembled in the basement of the chapel for what was a truly eerie scene .
At the center of the chamber , surrounded by a ring of dark columns , stood an ancient , eroded statue of the Madonna cradling her child .
The only illumination in this inner sanctum came from candles flickering at the feet of the Virgin Mary .
For what seemed like a very long time , but was probably only a few minutes , all of us stood in silence around the statue .
Contempt , derision , revulsion welled up in me at this religious display .
Here was the absurd superstition and idolatry that had driven me away from Catholicism as a youth .
I could not help but think of cinematic scenes involving depraved , robed cultists in movies like Rosemary ’s Baby and Eyes Wide Shut .
I remembered what the German shaman Christian Ratsch had said about monks , that they were " incomplete , " " crazy and weird . "
I tried to suppress my emotions , to observe without judgement , like an anthropologist , or a monk practicing mindfulness .
I reminded myself that this ritual is just another expression of the human yearning for solace and meaning .
Who knows what wounds drove these robed men to follow this strange , constricted path ?
I should feel compassion for them , not disgust .
At least one of them was a compassionate , gentle , good man .
I looked across the room , trying to identify Steindl - Rast , but the faces of the monks were all indistinguishable .
I saw only pale , featureless blurs hovering above the dark robes .
I awoke the next morning to the sound of a raven rasping outside my window .
After breakfast the monks and lay folk assembled in the chapel for a full mass , which included holy communion .
Monks and guests alike — everyone except for me -- walked to the center of the chapel , opened their mouths and accepted a wafer from the priest .
I kept sneaking glances at Steindl - Rast during the service .
He kept his eyes downcast or closed .
He seemed slighter , more frail , than he had a day earlier — or was I just projecting my knowledge of his struggle with depression onto him ?
Toward the end of the service , the priest asked if anyone wanted to share a prayer with the rest of us .
Guests prayed for loved ones who were ill , for parents struggling to raise children in these difficult times , for sons or daughters who were serving overseas in the armed forces .
Steindl - Rast offered the final prayer , for " John , a journalist . "
" God have mercy , " everyone intoned .
While I had been worrying about Steindl - Rast , he had been worrying about me .
What do you get when you buy a product ?
You get the product yes , but what else do you get ?
Customer service , probably .
What about information on how to make the product ?
Can you resell it ?
Can you repackage it as your own and resell it ( for example instead of Microsoft Windows can you resell it as Steph ’s Windows ) ?
Do you get the schematics on how to make it yourself ?
Not likely , but not everyone thinks so !
I ’ve never commented on any customer requests we ’ve ever gotten over the past three years since LandlordMax has been around , but this week we received such an audacious request that I ’m going to make a rule to the exception .
I will however leave out the person and company ’s name , as well I will paraphrase the emails going back and forth .
I will acknowledge that this is n’t the first time we ’ve received a unreasonable requests , however what ’s interesting about this one is that it is the most audacious request we ’ve ever received and it also had follow - up emails .
Without further ado the first email we received contained two questions .
The first was a general pre-sales question such as will the software do this or that for a special situation .
The second question is the big one .
It went along the lines of :
I want to repackage LandlordMax so that I can put my company logo on it and remove your company ’s logo .
Is this possible ?
Also , can I have access to your complete source code ?
Wow !
We ’ve received some requests in the past of people trying to resell it on their own , which by the way does require permission from whichever company makes the product ( often this is done with distributors or directly with the company through some sort of arrangement ) .
But not with this request , they wanted to brand the product as their own and have full access to the source code , the full schematics of LandlordMax !
This is basically like asking Microsoft for the source code of Windows and repacking it as say Steph ’s Windows .
Microsoft would never do that in a million years .
This is the same as Dan Brown selling a copy of his book The Da Vinci Code and with that you have his permission to repackage it under a different title by another author ( for example “ Steph ’s Da Vinci Code ” written by Stephane Grenier ) .
I do n’t think so !
When you buy a can of Coca - Cola , do you get access to the Coca - Cola formula to make your own and repackage it as Steph ’s Coca - cola ?
I do n’t think so !
So why are they asking ?
Maybe they just do n’t know any better , so let ’s give them the benefit of the doubt as we normally do ( honestly many people do n’t realize it until you explain it ) .
So I personally proceeded to respond to this request , more out of curiousity than anything else , mentionning that no they are n’t allowed , as well doing so without special permission is actually illegal ( copyright ) .
Surpringly they responded to this expressing pushing their request further .
Here ’s the paraphrase of what I received :
I ’m also thinking about reselling LandlordMax as I have found the trial version to be very good .
However , I would only feel comfortable selling it if I had anonymity where clients would think that this product has been developed by my own company .
I am happy to pay a fee for this or work on some commission / affiliate scheme with you .
Wow !
So what they ’re basically saying is that if you buy a can of Coca - Cola , you only feel right reselling it if you have complete control over the product , access to it ’s full research and development that took years to build , it ’s secret formula , and that you can repackage it as your own Steph ’s Coca - Cola .
Not only that , you want completely anonymity selling it however you want , at any price you want , etc. Complete and full control ?
Would any company oblige to this ?
I highly doubt it .
If you do n’t believe , make this request to Coca - Cola .
Luckily for the extra sentence at the end , where they mention they were happy to pay a fee for this .
What kind of fee ?
So I decided to push it for my own interest to see what their expections were for the fee , because at this point I knew this was n’t going any further .
To go back a second , my initial intention in my first reply was to try to steer them away from their repackaging concept and have them become an affiliate through our LandlordMax Affiliate Program .
This is a great little program that benefits everyone , they get a commission from any direct sales from them and it ’s automated by a third party service called ShareASale.com .
It ’s worked great for us and we have many affiliates this way .
However I could tell by their last email ( remember I ’m just paraphrasing above , and I did omit some of the content ) that they were n’t interested in the affiliate program .
So I did hinted that they could get full access to the source , etc. , but that it would be virtually the same as buying the company and it would cost them a substantial amount .
Needless to say this is the last I heard from them .
At the end of the day , I do n’t mind that they did n’t become a LandlordMax customer .
I suspect that the cost of dealing with them would have far outweighed the revenue they would have generated .
I ’m just amazed at the audacity that they had , what they expected to get when purchasing LandlordMax .
This is the biggest most unreasonable request we ’ve ever had which is why I thought it would be an interesting read .
And please do n’t think that I do n’t believe in partnerships , I do .
As an example , we ’re actually in the process of establish a strong partnership with a company in the UK that will sell LandlordMax along with their services and offer support above and beyond what we can offer above our own .
This company was very reasonable , they understood business , and came to us with an opportunity that made sense for both of us , it was a win - win situation .
If a company approaches us with an opportunity that makes sense , we have open ears .
Anyways , I did n’t want to go on such a rant ( my first on FollowSteph.com because I do n’t really believe in them ) but I thought it would make for an interesting read !
Eric Oliver , a political scientist at the University of Chicago , said his first instinct was to laugh at the gas and drive - through arguments .
But such claims often get wide attention , he says , and take on a life of their own .
“ This is like , let ’s find another reason to scapegoat fat people , ” Dr. Oliver says .
At an annual meeting of the Obesity Society , one talk correlated obesity with deaths in car accidents , and another correlated obesity with suicides .
Dr. Oliver , who attended , said no one in the crowd of at least 200 questioned whether the correlations were really cause and effect .
“ The funny thing was that everyone took it seriously , ” he said .
Katherine Flegal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also wryly cautions against being quick to link cause and effect .
“ Yes , obesity is to blame for all the evils of modern life , except somehow , weirdly , it is not killing people enough , ” she said .
“ In fact that ’s why there are all these fat people around .
They just wo n’t die . ”
The message in the blame - obesity approach , said James Morone , a political science professor at Brown University , is that it is so important to persuade fat people to lose weight that common sense disappears .
“ Anything we can say to persuade you , we will say , ” Dr. Morone added .
So is it working ?
It does n’t seem to be .
Fat people are more reviled than ever , researchers find , even as more people become fat .
When smokers and heavy drinkers turned pariah , rates of smoking and drinking went down .
Wo n’t fat people , in time , follow suit ?
Research suggests that the stigma of being fat leads to more eating , not less .
And if reducing the stigma suggests a solution , that ’s not working either .
“ One hypothesis about getting rid of stigma is having more contact with the stigmatized group , ” Dr. Brownell says .
But with obesity , the stigma seems to be growing along with the national girth .
In its latest attempt to decrease local network filesharing at universities , the RIAA has sent letters to 40 university presidents in 25 states informing them that * gasp * filesharing occurs on their campuses .
These letters are a part of the RIAA 's new " systematic program to identify and curtail " LAN filesharing .
Citing commonly used filesharing applications like DC ++ and OurTunes , the RIAA claims that students are turning to local networks in order to avoid the risks of detection associated with using the public Internet .
Apparently , local network piracy at schools is a major concern for the RIAA :
Despite the progress achieved by our collaborative efforts [ with universities ] , this remains an ever - evolving problem .
We cannot ignore the growing misuse of campus LAN systems or the toll this means of theft is taking on our industry .
As we prioritize our focus on campus LAN piracy in the coming year , we hope administrators will take this opportunity to fully evaluate their systems and take action to stop theft by all means .
The phrase " ever- evolving " is really very apt .
Despite the risk of lawsuits and massive statutory damages , computer users continue to find new ways to share content while eluding the music and movie industry hounds .
Observers have long predicted that the rampant lawsuits would eventually push users towards darknets , private networks that better protect anonymity .
The RIAA 's growing interest in local network filesharing reflects its acknowledgement of that possibility , and a desire to fight against it despite the increased difficulty .
In this case , it appears as though they plan to deputize school administrators and get them to use filtering technologies .
Most filtering technologies are expensive , and as the EFF points out , they are also easily circumvented .
Lawsuits and filtering clearly are n't enough to stop college students from swapping music files .
As if coercive university Napster taxes are n't bad enough , it is likely that RIAA tactics will continue to become more invasive as they search for new ways to force fans to pay up .
It 's not out of the quesiton that RIAA may try to get Congress to mandate use of filtering technologies at universities .
Given the current climate in Washington , it 's not far - fetched to imagine our elected representatives threatening to cut federal funding for universities that refuse to install filters .
Despite the challenges associated with detecting filesharing on campus LANs , it does n't look like the RIAA is ready to stop jousting with windmills just yet .
The 23 year old Grant Stanley has been sentenced to five months in prison , followed by five months of home detention , and a $ 3000 fine for the work he put in the private BitTorrent tracker Elitetorrents .
This ruling is the first BitTorrent related conviction in the US .
Stanley pleaded guilty earlier this year to “ conspiracy to commit copyright infringement ” and “ criminal copyright infringement ” .
He is one of the three defendants in the Elitetorrents operation better known as “ Operation D - Elite ” .
Operation D - Elite ( they love word tricks ) was orchestrated by the FBI with a little help from the MPAA in May 2005 , and resulted in the shutdown of one of the largest private BitTorrent trackers at that time .
FBI
Take home Message that replaced the Homepage of Elitetorrents after the shutdown
Two months ago we reported that Scott McCausland pleaded guilty to committing the same crimes .
Scott is to be sentenced on December 12 , 2006 , and invited everyone who sympathizes with him to write a letter to the judge on his behalf .
In a response to the present case US Attorney John Brownlee said :
“ This is the first criminal enforcement action against copyright infringement on a P2P network using BitTorrent technology .
We hope this case sends the message that cyberspace will not provide a shield of anonymity for those who choose to break our copyright laws . ”

Joining the growing list of places on this planet that are melting , Antarctica is losing some 36 cubic miles of ice every year , scientists said today .
For comparison , Los Angeles consumes roughly 1 cubic mile of fresh water a year .
The south polar region holds 90 percent of Earth ’s ice and 70 percent of the total fresh water on the planet , so any significant pace of melting there is important and could contribute to an already rising sea .
" This is the first study to indicate the total mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet is in significant decline , " said Isabella Velicogna of the University of Colorado at Boulder .
The study is detailed today in the online version of the journal Science .
Other studies have documented rapid melting , unprecedented in modern times , in Greenland and around the North Pole .
And rapid melting of individual glaciers has been noted in Antarctica .
For now , the newly measured melting might seem like a small quantity .
The loss of ice in Antarctica amounts to about 0.4 millimeters of global sea rise annually , with a margin of error of 0.2 millimeters , the study concludes .
There are about 25 millimeters in an inch .
However , computer models run in 2001 predicted Antarctica would gain ice during the 21st century due to increased precipitation in a warming climate .
But the new study , based on satellite measurements between 2002 and 2005 , shows the opposite .
Antarctica is twice as large as Australia .
The ice sheet , which covers about 98 percent of the continent , has an average thickness of about 6,500 feet — more than a mile .

Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn have finally admitted they are dating .
The two stars have previously refused to confirm they are an item , but during the promotion for their new film ' The Break Up ' - which ironically brought them together during the actress ' divorce from Brad Pitt - they admitted what was common knowledge for months .
When quizzed about her first meeting with Vince , Jennifer , 37 , said : " For me , it was just wow .
You get those moments pretty rarely .
"
You can kind of tell pretty quickly with someone , ' Oh , this is going to be easy .
Oh , this is going to be a tough one ' .
" He is the cream of the crop .
" Vince also admitted he was attracted to the former ' Friends ' star the first time he met her - and says he was bowled over by her terrific sense of humour .
He is quoted by Britain 's Grazia magazine as saying : " Yes , I did like her right off the bat as a person .
I think she 's terrific .
" Friendship is the biggest thing , and a sense of humour& I like someone who can make me laugh .
" When you 're younger , you have your priorities in a different place , but as you get older , I think having someone who makes you laugh and who you have a friendship and a trust with becomes important . "
The couple are rumoured to be setting up home together in Chicago , where they have just made a joint offer on a property .
Jennifer confirmed : " It really is my kind of town .

Alan Keyes 's Daffy Idea to Repeal the 17th Amendment
Mr. Gould , professor emeritus at the University of Texas at Austin , is writing a history of the Senate in the twentieth century .
Alan Keyes , the Republican senatorial candidate in Illinois , has now joined Senator Zell Miller of Georgia and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay in calling for repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution , the one that provides for the direct election of United States senators .
Senator Miller , who has introduced his own amendment to repeal the Seventeenth , contends that the direct election of senators “ was the death of the careful balance between state and federal governments . ”
Once the Senate was the province of members “ who thoughtfully make up their own minds , as they did during the Senate ’s greatest era of Clay , Webster , and Calhoun . ”
Now senators , in Miller ’s view , “ are mere cat ’s paws for the special interests . ”
Miller favors returning the right to elect senators to the state legislatures who had that job until the Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913 .
Keyes agrees since it seems likely that the Illinois electorate is not going to prove receptive to his bid for that state ’s open Senate seat .
Before this flawed idea gets any traction , it would be well to recall the historical circumstances that led to the adoption of the direct election amendment in the first place .
Why did Americans in the Progressive Era endorse this change in the nation ’s fundamental law ?
Put aside the senatorial giants that Miller mentions --- John C. Calhoun , Daniel Webster , and Henry Clay .
Consider three lesser known figures in the history of the upper house — J. Edward Addicks , William A. Clark , and William Lorimer .
Few history books devote more than a line or two to these three obscure gentlemen , but they were important players in the reason why the Seventeenth Amendment came into being .
By 1900 complaints about the way that United States senators were elected filled the press of the day .
“ The legislative system of electing Senators has broken down , ” wrote a commentator in the Arena in 1905 .
Critics cited the senators who had recently been indicted and convicted of crimes , Joseph R. Burton of Kansas and John Mitchell of Oregon .
Other senators such as Chauncey Depew of New York had been found to be on the payroll of corporations .
There was in the Senate the general presence , as the Nation put it , of “ those whose corruption or surrender to corporate interests has too long stained the reputation of a great legislative body . ”
Politicians associated with the Progressive Movement , such as William E. Borah of Idaho and Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas , argued that direct election represented a forward step toward cleaner politics when corruptible state legislatures gave way to the people .
Now to those three obscure men .
William A. Clark was a wealthy silver miner from Montana whom the legislature in that state sent to the Senate in 1899 .
Subsequent investigation determined that he had spent more than $ 140,000 of his money bribing lawmakers in the legislature .
After resigning his seat in early 1900 , he was returned to the Senate by the Montana legislature under less sordid conditions .
J. Edward Addicks was a millionaire from Pennsylvania who tried to buy himself a Senate seat from Delaware in the 1890s and early 1900s .
Spreading his cash around , he put the state into a political turmoil that left it without one of its senators for several years .
Finally , Senator William Lorimer received a majority of the votes from the Illinois legislature in 1909 .
Later revelations disclosed that bribery of some legislators had been a key part of Lorimer ’s victory .
The senator himself was not involved with the illegal acts , but the specter of “ Lorimerism ” convinced many citizens that legislatures were not the proper vehicles for selecting United States senators .
In 1912 Lorimer was expelled from the Senate .
By then the direct election of senators had become a constitutional amendment and was on its way to ratification .
The Seventeenth Amendment did not bring the new political morality to the Senate that its advocates had forecast .
Many problems of campaign finance , corrupted elections , and the power of special interests remain to plague the Senate chamber .
But a resolution of those issues will not occur by returning to a fancied golden age of senatorial excellence before the Seventeenth Amendment came on the scene .
State legislatures are not the answer to improving the Senate any more than they were in 1900 .
Such a reversion might have the effect of reducing campaign expenses since the cost of influencing several dozen state lawmakers would be well below the current outlay for running a statewide election .
Yet it is laughable , in light of the historical experience of a century ago , to suggest that a return to a system so susceptible to corruption , log- rolling , and the flouting of public opinion would be any kind of improvement over the present state of affairs .
The contemporary problems of the Senate need to be addressed .
Relying on the undemocratic methods that came before the Seventeenth Amendment provides no way to embark on the salutary process of reforming the Senate .

Thank you Mr. Clarke for exposing the ignorance and arrogance of Mr Gould ( pity the Texas education system ) , along with the hoax of constitutionality of the 17th Amendment .
To prove this , I will directly quote Mr. Gould , who stated that legislatures " gave up their power to elect senators ... " , which of course was State suffrage in the Senate .
A reading of Article V of the Constitution will reveal a couple of items outside what is common knowledge .
The Article spells out the standard Amendment process and the options available AND the two exceptions .
These exceptions are little known , with the first one simply preventing specific Clauses from being Amended for a limited time , which expired in 1808 .
The second exception is the applicable and states " and that no State , without its Consent , shall be deprived of it's equal Suffrage in the Senate . "
Mr. Lewis was correct that some states did " consent " and gave up their suffrage , but on 26 February 1913 , the Utah legislature rejected the Amendment .
Article V , as applied to the proposed 17th Amendment , would have required 100 % ratification instead of the standard three fourths .
The first exception to the standard amendment process as stated in Article V is a prohibition of Amending specific clauses for a limited time , while the second exception was to the three fourths rule to protect the balance created in Congress , with the House representing the " people " and the Senate where the " States " had their voice .
So the condescending use of " daffy " by Mr. Lewis highlights the arrogance of a professor writing on the History of the Senate , a body established by the Constitution .
This " historian " follows the sheep in his belief that the 17th Amendment was properly ratified , and fails to read and understand the ( roughly ) 150 word Article V and its simple and explicit instructions .
Now when others see his words and read Article V , the academic credentials he holds up will be tarnished by the plain and simple fact by the Utah rejection , the 17th Amendment , is ( presently ) invalid .
However , if the States that did not ratify in 1913 ( 10 + Alaska and Hawaii ) were to subsequently pass the Amendment in their Legislature , the only remaining question would be hypothetical passage by a 21st Century Utah Legislature qualify as ratification and override a prior rejection ?
That scenario would be theoretically be the simplest avenue to legitimate constitutional ratification of the 17th Amendment .
Joe Eldridge - 9/24/2008
I agree wholeheartedly with the idea of secret ballot .
It will prevent influence from outsiders .
I do think that the final election by the people still makes them accountable to the people and this is still out of balance .
They need to represent the state government for true balance to be restored .
Also the selected candidates would still need to advertise etc for the final election and this means raising money from outside interest .
The secret ballot part is all they had to do in 1913 and it alone would have solved the problems they were experiencing .
That and the " tie vote " could have been solved by the Governor breaking the tie .
The secret ballot would also allow a member of one party to " cross party lines " and vote for a person that they feel is actually better qualified without fear of retaliation by members of his own party .
This would result in better quality Senators .
Samuel K Swenson - 10/25/2007
Every time this issue arises I always wonder why the obvious argument against the 17th amendment does not come up .
Under Article 5 of the constitution the rules governing amendments are layed out .
Nearly every Constitutional scholar will agree that the Constitution makes a distinct delineation between the " people " and the " states " as separate entities .
Thus , when the constitution refers to " states " it is referring to a separate entity than the " people . "
The last part of Article 5 clearly states that the only thing about the Constitution that cannot be amended is that " no State , without its Consent , shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate . "
This means that unless each and every state unanimously agreed to the 17th amendment then the amendment is unconstitutional on its face .
Therefor this debate should not only revolve around policy , but it should also include the overall legality of the amendment as well .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Constitutional amendments require three quarters support from state legislatures , the very bodies the 17th Amendment stripped power from .
How was this managed ?
Mathieu Dub e - 11/28/2006
The 17th Amendement was a political solution that did nothing to fix the underlying problem .
Senators can be corrupted .
Whether or not they are elected by the State of the people of the State makes no difference in the concept .
A reform in the system where Senators are overseen ( just as they oversee functions of the executive branch ) would go much further to fixing the problem .
Repealing the 17th is no better solution to today 's problems than amending the Constitution was in 1913 .
Personaly I think we should go back to the original and then fix the problem .
More power to the States and less power to the Federal government .
I trust my neighbors more than a complete stranger .
dave josephsen - 11/25/2006
I 'm probably being dense , but given that article 1 , section 3 as it was originally written does n't specify how the legislatures should go about electing their representitives , it seems to me that this problem could have been solved by the state legislatures in the manner they saw most fit .
Why did anyone feel that this particular problem merited changing the constitution ?
J D M - 4/17/2006
I do n't really think you 've gave this idea enough critical thought before you dismissed it as crazy .
Let me ask some questions .
1 . What were the financial disclosure laws on the books when your example Senators were exposed , when the 17th Amendment passed , and today , and how did they differ ?
2 . What effect on your example Senators did organizations akin to present day " watch - dog " groups have in exposing said officials ?
3 . If the old system were still in place today , what impact would the present day Freedom of Information Act , current disclosure laws for federal officials , and watch - dog groups ( assuming those groups were n't as prevalent then as now ) have in keeping Senators in line ?
4 . Which would be easier to buy off : one elected representative or a majority / plurality of an elected body , given today 's disclosure laws and watch - dog groups ?
I really think this author 's casting off this idea as crazy without describing how different the political arenas were then versus now is tantamount to being prejudicial , which is not very scholarly .
Gary John Hagen - 12/29/2005
The idea of secret ballots could be used in a wider sense .
We accept the idea that the votes of the voting public should be secret - why not let the votes of representatives be secret the problem of buying votes applies to most bills .
We could vote for representatives based on their public positions but give them the freedom to vote their conscience without fear of election funds drying up or being voted out for taking unpopular votes .
Gary John Hagen - 12/29/2005
I like the idea .
I can't help you in Montana , but I will suggest it in Virginia to the political activists I know .
Jerry O'Neil - 10/3/2004
While the proper thing to do in the long run might be to repeal the 17th Amendment , I want to take an intermediate step at this time .
I want to introduce and pass a bill in Montana to have the political caucuses in the legislature nominate the U.S. Senate candidate for that caucus .
This would be a normal bill .
Not a resolution to amend the U.S. Constitution and not a bill to amend the Montana Constitution .
Just a bill to have the Republican caucus in the legislature nominate the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate and the Democrat caucus nominate the Democrat candidate for the U.S. Senate .
These nominations would be voted on by secret ballot within the caucuses .
This would be to prevent special interests from unduly influencing these nominations .
When W.A. Clark wanted to be appointed to the U.S. Senate he purchased the necessary votes .
The method I am proposing is designed to prevent the same nefarious actions from occurring in the future .
Any other parties with representation in the state legislature would have their legislative caucus nominate the U.S. Senate candidate for their party .
Any other parties without representation in the state legislature would nominate their U.S. Senate candidates at their state convention .
There would no longer be a primary election for U.S. Senate candidates in Montana ( and any other states that adopts this idea ) .
The candidates who have received the nominations of the various caucuses would appear on the general election ballot to be voted on by the general population .
This method of nominating U.S. Senate candidates would clean up U.S. Senate elections in at least four ways :
1 . It would allow and cause senate candidates to be nominated on the power of their statesmanship rather than their ability to raise money .
The state legislatures would nominate the candidates they believe they can work with .
Quite likely these would be people they have previously worked with , such as governors , secretaries of state , superintendents of school , state auditors or other legislators .
2 . This would amount to campaign finance reform .
The state legislatures would not be likely to base their nomination on who has access to campaign donations from the drug manufactures , Corporations such as Enron , big unions or big media .
3 . Because they would vote by secret ballot , it would be much less likely the state legislator 's votes would be bought .
Not many lobbyists or power brokers would be willing to pay big money for votes when they would have no way to know if the legislators actually voted the way they were paid to vote .
4 . The candidates who receive the nominations from the state legislature (s ) would still have to be presented to the public for the general election .
There they would have an opponent to air their dirty laundry before the public .
The caucuses would want to nominate candidates who are electable .
I am looking for support for this idea .

Lewis L. Gould - 8/24/2004
Actually , it was ratified rather quickly .
Congress passed the resolution about the amendment in May 1912 and the amendment was ratified a year later as the legislatures acted with a high degree of speed .
In some senses the legislatures had already adopted the amendment in practice .
For a state such as Oregon , the legislature had instituted a procedure where the candidates for election to that body promised that they would vote for the winner of a popular election for the Senate , regardless of party .
Other states in the early 20th century adopted similar procedures or held primaries to choose senatorial candidates .
The pressure for adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment came from the legislatures themselves during the first decade of the 20th century .
So the legislatures gave up their power to elect senators with few protests .
There is a sense in some states that legislatures found the process of electing senators a distraction from their other business , a source of potential political problems , and over time a resonsibility they were quite ready to relinquish .
A good brief essay about the amendment in the Senate is Larry J. Easterling , " Senator Joseph L. Bristow and the Seventeenth Amendment , " Kansas Historical Quarterly , 41 ( Winter , 1975 ) : 488-511 .

Let me try that quote again : " Clark himself is so thin that in evening clothes he just seems the handle for his yellow mop of curly hair and whiskers .
Someone said if you took away the whiskers and the scandal , there would be nothing left of him , but , however , he has used his money , he came by it honestly , which is more than is said of some other senatorial millionaires . "
Lewis L. Gould - 8/23/2004
Thanks for the comment and correction .
For a little more on Clark , see Ellen Maury Slayden , Washington Wife , pp. 91-92 .
" Clark himself is to thin than in evening clothes he just seems to handle for his yellow mop of curly hair and whiskers .
Somone said if you took away the whiskers and the scandal there would be nothing left of him , but , however he has used his money , he came by it honestly , which is more than is said of some other senatorial millionaires . "

SF supes outlaw foam food containers , decriminalize adult pot use
2006-11-14 15:40:00 PST
SAN FRANCISCO --
The Board of Supervisors voted today to outlaw the use of Styrofoam and other polystyrene products by city restaurants and to effectively decriminalize the use , sale and cultivation of marijuana by adults .
The food container legislation , introduced by Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin and approved unanimously on the first of two votes needed for passage , would apply to about 3,400 restaurants in San Francisco as well city facility food service providers and food vendor companies contracting with the city .
It is scheduled to be implemented June 1 , 2007 .
Polystyrene containers are blamed for filling up landfills and breaking down into smaller nonbiodegradable pieces that harm marine and other wildlife when they are ingested .
In passing the ordinance , San Francisco joins number of other cities around the country , including Oakland , Portland , Ore. , and Berkeley , which banned Styrofoam and similar products nearly 20 years ago .
The marijuana legislation , which passed on an initial vote 8 - 3 , would set nearly all crimes involving marijuana as the lowest law enforcement priority for city police and urges the district attorney to adopt the same policy when prosecuting criminal defendants .
It passed with the blessing of the police officials , but over the complaints of some residents who say the marijuana trade attracts or occurs along with other criminal activity that undermines the quality of life in their neighborhoods .
Ammiano introduced the legislation in August at the behest of groups pushing for the national decriminalization of marijuana .
Alaska could lose its northern lights , scientists say
The shift could mean that Alaska will lose its northern lights , or auroras , which might then be more visible in areas of Siberia and Europe .
The magnetic poles are different from geographic poles , the surface points marking the axis of Earth 's rotation .
Magnetic poles are known to migrate and , occasionally , swap places .
" This may be part of a normal oscillation and it will eventually migrate back toward Canada , " Joseph Stoner , a palaeomagnetist at Oregon State University , told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) in San Francisco .
Wandering poles
Previous studies have shown that the strength of the Earth 's magnetic shield has decreased 10 % over the past 150 years .
During the same period , the north magnetic pole wandered about 1,100 km ( 685 miles ) into the Arctic , according to the new analysis .
The rate of the magnetic pole 's movement has increased in the last century compared with fairly steady movement in the previous four centuries , the Oregon researchers said .
The Oregon team examined the sediment record from several Arctic lakes .
Since the sediments record the Earth 's magnetic field at the time , scientists used carbon dating to track changes in the magnetic field .
They found that the north magnetic field shifted significantly in the last thousand years .
It generally migrated between northern Canada and Siberia , but has occasionally moved in other directions .
Rate of change
At the present rate , the north magnetic pole could swing out of northern Canada into Siberia .
If that happens , Alaska could lose its northern lights , or auroras , which occur when charged particles streaming away from the Sun collide with gases in the ionosphere , causing them to glow .
The north magnetic pole was first discovered in 1831 and when it was revisited in 1904 , explorers found it had moved by 50 km ( 31 miles ) .
For centuries , navigators using compasses had to learn to deal with the difference between magnetic and geographic north .
A compass needle points to the north magnetic pole , not the geographic North Pole .
At least four Palestinian clerks working in the Palestinian Prime Minister 's Office in Ramallah , lost consciousness Monday after opening a package thought to contain a poisonous substance .
The package arrived at the Palestinian government building in Ramallah , sent to the office of Nasser al - Din Shaer , Ismail Haniyeh 's deputy prime minister .
Sources in the office said that the package was sent from an address in Tel Aviv .
They refused to pass on details about the address .
One of the clerks opened the package , which emanated a strange smell , and passed out .
After , at least another three clerks felt unwell and lost consciousness .
According to some reports , seven clerks have been hospitalized following the incident .
War on Terror Closure imposed on West Bank due to terror alerts Efrat Weiss Security forces receive 17 specific warnings regarding terror groups ’ intent to carry out suicide , mortar , rocket and shooting attacks from West Bank ; officials say terrorists aim to open third front against Israel Closure imposed on West Bank due to terror alerts
After the clerks lost consciousness , panic gripped the employees working in the office .
This is due to the fact that Shaer himself is practically the only Hamas leader in the West Bank that was n't arrested in the wave of recent arrests made by the IDF and the Shin Bet .
Shaer said that the poisonous package was an Israeli attempt to hurt the Palestinian prime minister and his deputy , noting that the package was addressed to Haniyeh .
However , it must be mentioned that Prime Minister Haniyeh does not usually come to Ramallah , and has n't been in the city at all since his appointment to the position out of fear that Israel will hurt , or arrest him .
Shaer added that the office intends to open an investigation of the issue .
In Ramallah , opinions about the source of the package were divided – some said that there is no doubt that it was an Israeli attempt to hurt Shaer , and yet others said that the option must be checked that it may have been connected to the conflict and power struggles between the Palestinian ministers from Hamas , and the clerks in their offices , most of whom were appointed by Fatah .
Our parent organization , the Randolph Bourne Institute , is named after an early 20th - century liberal famous for , among other things , his trenchant observation that “ war is the health of the State ”  a phrase that takes on quite a different connotation in our degraded era .
In these dark times , Bourne ’s statement might be taken as meaning approval of war : after all , the State , in this age of Big- Brotherism and “ big government conservatism , ” is a Good Thing , and it ’s only natural in this context to wish it good health : the more overweening and built - up , the better .
There was a time , however , when Americans feared the accumulation of power , especially when it accrued to the federal government in Washington : conservatives of the Goldwater stripe ( and , further back , the followers of Sen. Robert A. Taft ) , were especially vigilant against this danger .
The liberals of Bourne ’s day , before they were Wilsonized and Rooseveltized , were wary of government ’s coercive essence .
Both Left and Right were joined at the root by the American libertarian consensus  a reflexive distrust of government power rooted in history and reinforced by a rebellious temperament embedded in the American consciousness .
No more : today , the “ conservatives ” on the Fox “ News ” channel and the Rush Limbaugh - radio talk show circuit are worshippers at the altar of State Power .
No expansion of governmental authority is too vast , too broad , too brazenly contrary to the spirit and letter of the Constitution to evade their enthusiastic endorsement .
Liberals , to some extent , are regaining their old distrust of government power , largely in reaction to the radical incursions on our civil liberties authored by the Bush administration .
Yet the liberal mainstream , which extends from the Hillary Clinton Fan Club on the “ far left ” to the editors of The New Republic in the supposed center , stood by in silence or else openly applauded while this president eviscerated our civil liberties .
A massive attack on the traditional principle of habeas corpus  which means that the authorities must have some stated reason , some evidence that a crime has been committed , to hold an individual in detention  would , in normal times , have provoked a storm of protest .
However , that was before 9/11 , before the impact of those planes on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon tore a gaping hole in the space - time continuum and propelled us into an alternate universe known to avid readers of Superman comics as Bizarro World  a parallel plane of existence where up is down , right is wrong , and the Constitution is really a mandate for the president ’s unlimited authority .
The Republican Party , previously devoted to the principles of less government , decentralized authority , and economic liberty , immediately transformed itself into the champion of more government , including a significant increase in federal spending and , more ominously , the establishment of a rudimentary police state .
Thus was born Bizarro Conservatism , an ideology that , in every conceivable aspect , inverts the core principles of pre-9/11 conservatism .
Accordingly , Bizarro Conservatives welcome a government that routinely spies on its own people and has the power to indefinitely detain anyone , including U.S. citizens , without having to explain why to a judge or a jury .
This “ right ” has been claimed by the administration , on behalf of the president , on the theory that the executive branch enjoys effectively unlimited power in wartime , and now they are moving to consolidate this aspiring presidential dictatorship in legislative form [ .pdf ] , as the Washington Post reports :
“ Lawmakers and administration officials announced last week that they had reached accord on the plan for the detention and military trials of suspected terrorists , and it is scheduled for a vote this week .
But in recent days the Bush administration and its
House allies successfully pressed for a less restrictive description of how the government could designate civilians as ‘ unlawful enemy combatants , ’ the sources said yesterday .
They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of negotiations over the bill . ”
The question of just who is or can be an “ unlawful combatant ”  and therefore , according to the Bush administration , may be seized and jailed without trial or even an acknowledgment from the authorities  is the issue at hand , and the authoritarian “ conservatives ” of the Bizarro persuasion are pushing hard to breach the inner battlements of the Constitution , as the Post piece makes all too clear :
“ Human rights experts expressed concern yesterday that the language in the new provision would be a precedent - setting congressional endorsement for the indefinite detention of anyone who , as the bill states , ‘ has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States ’ or its military allies .
The definition applies to foreigners living inside or outside the United States and does not rule out the possibility of designating a U.S. citizen as an unlawful combatant . “
The ultimate expansion of the “ unlawful combatant ” definition to include any and all opposition to the War Party , whether military or political , is only a matter of time , and not much time at that .
This administration and its allies have long maintained that their critics are “ objectively ” aiding the terrorist enemy .
If Iraq is the main theater of our war on terrorism , then criticism of the war effort , such as organizing an antiwar demonstration , amounts to “ material support ” for “ hostilities against the United States . ”
And if we include in this legal interdict all criticism of our “ military allies , ” then participating in a demonstration against Israeli aggression in Lebanon could also get one designated an “ unlawful combatant . ”
According to Kate Martin , director of the Center for National Security Studies , the inclusion of individuals said to have “ supported hostilities ”  as opposed to those who “ engage in acts ” of warfare against the U.S.  shows that “ the government intends the legislation to sanction its seizure and indefinite detention of people far from the battlefield . ”
Which raises an important point : where is the battlefield , anyway ?
When it comes to the all - pervasive “ war on terrorism , ” it is everywhere .
As Suzanne Spaulding , former assistant general counsel at the CIA , explains it , the proposed legislation ,
“ Would give the administration a stronger basis on which to argue that Congress has recognized that the battlefield is wherever the terrorist is , and they can seize people far from the area of combat , label them as unlawful enemy combatants , and detain them indefinitely . ”
First they came for José Padilla .
Now they ’re coming for the rest of us
The War Party cannot carry out its program of overseas conquest and “ regime change ” without cracking down on the home front  that is , by equating antiwar sentiment with treason , including in the legal sense .
The “ area of combat ” is far wider than the mountainous passes of Afghanistan or the growing mountain of bloodstained rubble that is Iraq : the main battlefield , as this administration well knows , is on the home front .
It is a war for the hearts and minds of Americans  the one theater of operations in which they cannot afford to lose .
War is indeed the health of the State , because all states are simply instruments of coercion .
It is precisely in time of war that governments exercise their core function , which is the large - scale deployment of organized violence .
The efficient delivery of this violence , in such places and instances as required , demands a highly centralized , authoritarian command structure , one ideally suited to the mindset and proclivities of our Bizarro Conservatives in that it brooks no dissent .
For once , I agree with Andrew Sullivan :
“ Whatever else this is , it is not a constitutional democracy .
It is a thinly - veiled military dictatorship , subject to only one control : the will of the Great Decider .
And the war that justifies this astonishing attack on American liberty is permanent , without end . “
I might add , however , that Sullivan is only getting what he asked for .
After all , he was one of the biggest and loudest supporters of the invasion of Iraq : he railed and ranted for months on end until he finally got what he wanted .
It was Sullivan who declared , shortly after 9/11 , that the late Susan Sontag and the intellectual elites on the East and West coasts amounted to an intellectual “ fifth column ” in the struggle against Osama bin Laden .
Nor do I recall him protesting when this president declared that the hostilities would last for at least a generation .
Now he ’s shocked  shocked !
 that the War Party is moving to seize “ emergency powers ” in what amounts to a coup d’état against the Constitution .
Sullivan may protest that no , he never asked for this , but what did he imagine would happen in the atmosphere of war hysteria he and his erstwhile neocon allies promoted ?
In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 , when the anthrax letters sent to the media and congressional offices opened up a whole new level of public panic , Sullivan was demanding that we use nuclear weapons on the Iraqis .
We had to “ act now , ” he screeched , certain in the knowledge that the Iraqis had sent the anthrax , and “ draw a line . ”
While this “ need not mean nuclear weapons , ” on the other hand , it just might mean nuking the crap out of Baghdad .
In the face of such emotionalism as was unleashed by the events of 9/11 and their immediate aftermath , no measure , no matter how draconian or cruel , seemed unreasonable to some , like Sullivan , who had even fancied themselves “ libertarians . ”
( See Cathy Young ’s extraordinary endorsement of police - state measures in the “ libertarian ” Reason magazine for a particularly reprehensible example . )
Of all those now decrying this administration ’s political and legal onslaught against our civil liberties , Sullivan is the one least entitled to feign surprise .
He and his fellow neocons utilized the emotionalism and hysteria generated by 9/11 to unleash the U.S. military on Iraq and prepare the ground for further “ regime change ” throughout the region , including Iran and Syria .
What Sullivan apparently did n’t realize  or , rather , washes his hands of  is that this meant regime change on the home front as well .
The program of the War Party  perpetual war and the creation of an American empire  had to mean the overthrow of our constitutional republic , and the rise of something else .
Something that has been , so far , alien to America , but is now , sadly , a looming possibility : a dictatorship “ legally ” empowered by “ emergency ” measures , such as the one presently before the Senate [ .pdf ] .
Bizarro Conservatism , birthed in the firestorm of intellectual radioactivity sparked by 9/11 , is the mutant offspring of a philosophy that once meant something quite other than war , torture , and the police state .
That Sullivan is coming around to this realization rather late  and with a history of having helped midwife this monster into existence  is cold comfort for those of us who warned of this outcome from the very beginning .
The High Court in Manchester has ruled that an email cannot be recognised as a legal written offer if it does not contain a signature or name within the body of the mail .
The inclusion of a user name in the message header is not enough .
Judge Pelling ruled that the automatic inclusion of an email address is not enough to count as a signature .
The dispute was between JPF , a Portuguese bed maker , and Bedcare ( UK ) Ltd and its director Nilesh Metha .
According to court documents , JPF applied for a winding up order because Bedcare owed it money .
Metha sent an email , or got one of his staff to , offering a personal guarantee to JPF if they would withdraw the winding up order .
Mr Metha did not sign the email but the header read " nelmetha@aol.com " .
JPF phoned and accepted the offer made - the hearing for the winding up order was adjourned for two weeks .
Bedcare subsequently did go out of business .
Metha claimed that the email was not enough to qualify as a signature under the requirements of the 1677 Statute of Frauds , and therefore he was not liable for the personal guarantee .
Judge Pelling said : " In my judgment the inclusion of an e-mail address in such circumstances is a clear example of the inclusion of a name which is incidental in the sense identified by Lord Westbury in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention ....
I conclude that the e-mail ... did not bear a signature sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Section 4 . "
Full judgement available from Bailii here .
The end result of this could be that people who include a signature and disclaimer at the bottom of their emails might actually be making themselves more liable than people who just send one line emails .

Success Is Viral
" I think advertisers will be able to create viral ads if they are willing to take the creative risks necessary to make them happen .
To make something viral it can't feel like a traditional ad .
If you try to push the same message in a viral piece that you 're playing on network TV during prime time , it wo n't work .
If you can do something a little edgier ( or self deprecating ) it can work .
Brand managers should look to the Web as a place to experiment and have a little fun with their brand . "

The US has got an image problem when it comes to the internet .
US administration coming under worldwide pressure over the net
It has even lost the support of the European Union .
It stands alone as the divisive battle over who runs the internet heads for a showdown at a key UN summit in Tunisia next month .
The stakes are high , with the European Commissioner responsible for the net , Viviane Reding , warning of a potential web meltdown .
" The US is absolutely isolated and that is dangerous , " she said during a briefing with journalists in London .
" Imagine the Brazilians or the Chinese doing their own internet .
That would be the end of the story .
" I am very much afraid of a fragmented internet if there is no agreement . "
Brokering the peace
The UN has been wrestling over who should run the internet for a number of years .
It was one of the issues which divided nations at the World Summit on the Information Society ( WSIS ) in Geneva two years ago .
The second phase of the UN conference is due to take place in Tunisia from the 16 to 18 November .
There is a problem as many parts of the world do n't like the fact that one country is linked to the organism that technically rules the internet
Viviane Reding , European Commissioner
The private company was set up by the US Department of Commerce to oversee the domain name and addressing systems , such as country domain suffixes .
It manages how net browsers and e-mail programs direct traffic .
Icann was to gain its independence from the Department of Commerce by September 2006 .
But in July the US said it would " maintain its historic role in authorising changes or modifications to the authoritative root zone file " .
America 's determination to remain the ultimate purveyor of the internet has angered other countries which believe it is time to come up with a new way of regulating the digital traffic of the 21st century .
In the face of opposition from countries such as China , Iran and Brazil , and several African nations , the US is now isolated ahead of November 's UN summit .
The row threatens to overshadow talks on other issues such as bringing more people online and tackling spam e-mail .
Global forum
America 's traditional ally , Europe , has been left trying to find a way of brokering the peace .
" There is a problem as many parts of the world do n't like the fact that one country is linked to the organism that technically rules the internet , " said Commissioner Reding .
" Many countries would like a multilateral approach . "
Countries like China want a greater say over the net 's future
The EU does not intend to scrap Icann .
It would continue in its current technical role .
Instead Europe is suggesting a way of allowing countries to express their position on internet issues , though the details on how this would happen are vague .
" We have no intention to regulate the internet , " said Commissioner Reding , reassuring the US that the EU was not proposing setting up a new global body .
Rather she talked of a " model of cooperation " , of an international forum to discuss the internet .
Her carefully chosen form of words may help assuage a Bush administration which is vehemently opposed to any kind of international body to govern the internet .
" I am sure we will find a solution in interests of the internet , " said Mrs Reding .
" We think we could have an agreement on what 's on the table . "
French scientists have learned howwhich causes a major food - borne illness , commandeers cellular transport machinery to invade cells and hide from the body 's immune system .
They believe that other infectious organisms may use the same mechanism .
The Listeria bacterium , found in soil and water , can be transmitted to humans via undercooked and unpasteurized food , causing flu - like symptoms or gastrointestinal distress .
For individuals with weakened immune systems , listeriosis can be fatal , and infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage , stillbirth , premature delivery , or infection of the newborn .
The research was conducted by Pascale Cossart , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute international research scholar , and her colleague Esteban Veiga at the Institut Pasteur in Paris , and will be published in the August 21 , 2005 , issue of Nature Cell Biology .
Cossart and Veiga detailed how Listeria invades cells by activating cellular machinery that transports viruses , small molecules , and proteins .
Once it has safely entered a cell , the microbe can replicate and continue the process of infection .
The body usually deals with bacteria and other large , foreign microbes through a process called phagocytosis .
Specialized cells engulf the invading microbe and destroy it .
Scientists long believed that cells use a second process , called endocytosis , to deal with smaller molecules or viruses .
In endocytsosis , a cell 's outer membrane pinches inward around the target to form a pocket that 's brought inside the cell , creating a structure called a vesicle .
" Phagocytosis and endocytosis may , in fact , be more similar than past research suggests .
This is a totally new concept , " Cossart says .
Cossart 's lab had observed that Listeria - which is 20 times the size of the largest particle scientists believed a cell could take in by endocytosis - could invade non-phagocytic cells .
Other labs had made similar observations with other bacteria .
Cossart and Veiga investigated the underlying machinery behind this uncommon invasion strategy , which they knew depended on an interaction between a protein on the surface of the bacteria , known as InlB , and a protein called Met on the surface of the cell it was invading .
They discovered that when InlB interacts with Met , the cell responds by adding a chemical tag to Met that flags it for protein recycling or degradation .
Since
Met is on the outside surface of the cell and the recycling and degradation machineries are inside , the cell must bring Met inside through endocytosis in order to dispose of it .
As the cell creates the vesicle that will transport tagged Met , Listeria stows away and invades the cell .
By manipulating the gene expression of the cells Listeria was invading , the researchers showed that specific molecules known to be involved in endocytosis were essential for successful invasion by Listeria .
Similarly , they found that an enzyme that tags proteins for recycling was also required .
Listeria 's use of receptor - mediated endocytosis to infect hosts , according to Cossart , suggests that other bacteria may exploit the same mechanism to gain entry into non-phagocytic cells .
" This mechanism of cell entry may be used by several different kinds of bacteria , which is a major deviation from the belief that endocytosis is strictly for importing small molecules into cells , " she says .

With the announcement of the first Intel based Macs yesterday , many users have rejoiced in being able to dual - boot both Mac OS X and Windows .
Unfortunately , this is not the case ; due to Apple 's use of the extensible firmware interface ( EFI ) rather than BIOS , current Windows releases will not run on the systems .
On Tuesday at Macworld , Apple senior vice president of worldwide product marketing Phil Schiller said the company would not specifically block the use of Windows on Mac hardware .
Instead , limitations in Windows itself will prevent its use on the new MacBook Pro laptop and iMac .
With the switch to Intel processors , Apple also moved from Open Firmware to EFI , which is an updated BIOS specification developed by Intel .
Advanced features include the ability to boot into an EFI shell and run diagnostics and power up the CPU into a fully functional state immediately .

EFI also separates the control of devices from the operating system , meaning it can initialize hardware before loading the OS .
This feature would allow for a system to connect to the Internet and download updated drivers before booting up .
Intel initially deployed EFI as part of its Itanium architecture .
As such , Microsoft only included support for the BIOS replacement in its IA64 and later x64 operating systems .
While Microsoft plans to add EFI support in 32 - bit versions of Windows Vista , a final release is n't due until the end of the year .
Microsoft 's 64 - bit versions of Windows will also not work despite supporting EFI , because Apple 's Intel platform is strictly 32 - bit at the moment .
For its part , Microsoft encouraged Apple to build hardware compatible with Windows .
" We have an open specification and a process for certifying the hardware .
We welcome all efforts in this area and we 'd support Apple the same way we support every other PC manufacturer , " a company spokesperson told BetaNews .
" Anyone , including Apple , can purchase and re-sell Windows for use on their industry - standard hardware . "

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has been MIT 's introductory pre-professional computer science subject since 1981 .
It emphasizes the role of computer languages as vehicles for expressing knowledge and it presents basic principles of abstraction and modularity , together with essential techniques for designing and implementing computer languages .
This course has had a worldwide impact on computer science curricula over the past two decades .
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
( a different course )
An introduction to programming and the power of abstraction , using Abelson and Sussman 's classic textbook of the same name .
Key concepts include : building abstractions , computational processes , higher - order procedures , compound data , data abstractions , controlling interactions , generic operations , self - describing data , message passing , streams and infinite data structures , meta- linguistic abstraction , interpretation of programming languages , machine model , compilation , and embedded languages .
( a different course )
In CS 61A , we are interested in teaching you about programming , not about any particular programming language .
We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity , such as functional programming , data abstraction , object - oriented programming , and query systems .
To get past generalities you must have programming practice in some particular language , and in this course we use Scheme , a dialect of Lisp .
This language is particularly well - suited to the organizing ideas we want to teach .
Our hope , however , is that once you have learned the essence of programming , you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days ' work .
The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science , with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer 's point of view .
This first course concentrates mostly on the idea of abstraction , allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low - level operations dictated by the computer hardware .
The next course , CS 61B , will deal with the more advanced engineering aspects of software on constructing and analyzing large programs and on techniques for handling computationally expensive programs .
Finally , CS 61C concentrates on machines and how they carry out the programs you write .

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science , with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer ’s point of view .
CS 61A covered high - level approaches to problem - solving , providing you with a variety of ways to organize solutions to programming problems : as compositions of functions , collections of objects , or sets of rules .
In CS 61B , we move to a somewhat more detailed ( and to some extent , more basic ) level of programming .
As in 61A , the correctness of a program is important .
In CS 61B , we ’re concerned also with engineering .
An engineer , it is said , is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar .
Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data .
We ’ll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs .
The subjects covered in this course include C and assembly language programming , how higher level programs are translated into machine language , the general structure of computers , interrupts , caches , address translation , CPU design , and related topics .
The only prerequisite is that you have taken Computer Science 61B , or at least have solid experience with a C - related programming language .

Course homepage
This course covers topics on the engineering of computer software and hardware systems : techniques for controlling complexity ; strong modularity using client - server design , virtual memory , and threads ; networks ; atomicity and coordination of parallel activities ; recovery and reliability ; privacy , security , and encryption ; and impact of computer systems on society .
We will also look at case studies of working systems and readings from the current literature provide comparisons and contrasts , and do two design projects .
Graduate Computer Architecture
This course focuses on the techniques of quantitative analysis and evaluation of modern computing systems , such as the selection of appropriate benchmarks to reveal and compare the performance of alternative design choices in system design .
The emphasis is on the major component subsystems of high performance computers : pipelining , instruction level parallelism , memory hierarchies , input / output , and network - oriented interconnections .
Computer Architecture
The purpose of this course is to give you a broad understanding of the concepts behind several advanced microarchitectural features in today ’s microprocessors and to illustrate those concepts with appropriate ( usually modern ) machine examples .
We will cover the rationale for and the designs of strategies for instruction sets , dynamic branch prediction , multiple - instruction issue , dynamic ( out - of - order ) instruction scheduling , multithreaded processors , shared memory multiprocessors , and , if there is time , dataflow machines .
Some of these topics require some understanding from what is normally thought of as undergraduate material ; for these , we ’ll briefly review that material , and then go on from there .
You will augment your knowledge of the architectural schemes by doing experimental studies that examine and compare the performance of several alternative implementations for a particular feature .
Here you will learn how to design architectural experiments , how to choose metrics that best illustrate a feature ’s performance , how to analyze performance data and how to write up your experiment and results - all skills computer architects , and , actually , researchers and developers in any applied subfield of computer science , use on a regular basis .

Oct. 18 , 2006  --
The " wonders of the world " concept dates back to the fifth century B.C. , when the Greek historian Herodotus contemplated the amazing achievements of art and architecture created by the Persians and the Greeks .
However , Antipater of Sidon , who wrote in the second century B.C. , is credited with putting together the first list of wonders .
Many historians now believe that the list served as a guidebook for ancient " tourists " traveling to see the revered sites .
The list that we acknowledge today was compiled in the Middle Ages and comprised the seven most impressive man-made monuments from the ancient world .
Since the list came mostly from ancient Greek writings , though , only sites that would have been known to the ancient Greeks were included .
Today only one of the original wonders still exists , and there is doubt that all seven ever existed , but the concept of the wonders of the world has continued to excite and fascinate people everywhere for centuries .
The Original Seven Wonders of the World
The Great Pyramid of Giza
Constructed around the year 2560 B.C. , the great Pyramid at Giza is the only wonder that remains standing from the original list of seven .
Egyptologists believe that the stunning monument , constructed from approximately 2 million blocks of stone and believed to have taken approximately 20 years and 20,000 men to complete , was built as a tomb for the fourth century Pharoah Khufu .
Throughout history , experts have marveled at the remarkable accuracy of the pyramid 's construction .
The base , which covers 13 acres , is almost a perfect square and each corner is aligned almost exactly with the four points on a compass .
Excavations have unearthed three chambers , known as the Unfinished Chamber , the Queen 's Chamber and the King 's Chamber .
In addition , using a robot , researchers have explored many of the tunnels and alleyways that run deep into the monument .
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were reportedly a centerpiece of the ancient metropolis of Babylon ( about 50 miles south of modern day Baghdad ) .
Strangely , the historical records of the Babylonians do not mention the wondrous hanging gardens , leading some scholars to doubt that they ever existed .
Regardless of the omission , stories of the gardens spread over time throughout the ancient world , and ancient writers recorded numerous descriptions .
The story goes that King Nebudchadnezzar II , who ruled in the seventh century B.C. , built the hanging gardens to reproduce the mountain scenery that his wife was accustomed to from her homeland of Medina .
Despite the romantic image of gardens that floated in midair , many experts now agree that if they existed at all , the hanging gardens were an elaborate series of gardens " terraced " one on top of another on a hilly countryside .
The Statue of Zeus at Olympia
Standing more than 40 feet tall and constructed of ivory and gold , the statue of Zeus within the Temple at Olympia ( on the west coast of modern Greece ) was constructed by the Greek sculptor Pheidias around 435 B.C .
The giant and stunning white statue sat overlooking the grounds where the original Olympic games were held , and people came from around the Greek empire to pay homage to Zeus and participate in the games .
Scholars agree that the statue remained in the temple for more than 800 years , but there is some debate about when and how the statue was destroyed .
Some scholars believe that the statue was destroyed in a fire in the temple in the fifth century .
Others believe that the statue was transported from the temple to a palace in Constantinople , where it perished in a fire around the year 462 .
The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
Built around the year 550 B.C. by the architect Cherisphron , the great marble temple at Ephesus ( located in modern day Turkey ) was built in honor of Artemis , the Greek goddess of hunting and fertility .
The stunning marble structure was surrounded by 127 Ionic columns that reached to a height of 60 feet .
The facade of the temple was adorned with bronze statues attributed to a number of expert sculptors of the era and overlooked a courtyard that served as a marketplace for people from near and far to trade their goods .
On July 21 , 256 B.C. , the night of Alexander the Great 's birth , a man named Herostatus burned the main building to the ground , hoping to make his name immortal .
Another temple was reconstructed on the site but was destroyed by the Goths in the year 262 .
The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
Admired for its stunning beauty , the Mausoleum at Hailcarnassus ( located near the modern city of Bodrum in Turkey ) was built as the tomb for the Persian King Mausollos of Caria , and was completed around 35 B.C. , a few years after Mausollos ' death .
The Mausoleum , which no longer exists , was exceptional for its massive size , with a base of about 1,2000 square feet and a total height of 140 feet .
The burial chamber and the sarcophagus , which was built of white alabaster and adorned with gold , sat on top of a stepped podium and was surrounded by Ionic columns .
Despite the Mausoleum 's size , visitors were most impressed by the beautiful decorations and statues that adorned it .
Sixteen centuries after its construction , the Mausoleum was damaged by an earthquake , and in the early 15th century , crusaders destroyed what remained of the Mausoleum and used the bricks to build a castle that still stands today .
The Colossus of Rhodes
The 110 - foot high statue of Colossus overlooked the ancient harbor of the Greek Island of Rhodes for only 56 years , but its size and construction inspired such awe in its visitors that centuries after its destruction it was included on the list of ancient wonders .
The people of Rhodes commissioned sculptor Chares of Lindos to build the giant bronze statue of their patron deity Helios the Sun God in 294 B.C. Sadly , in 238 B.C. , Rhodes was hit by an earthquake and the city 's beloved Colossus fell .
However , according to historical accounts , visitors to Rhodes were still awed by the statue even as it laid in ruins on the ground .
In 652 , an invading Arab army destroyed the fallen Colossus , and some historical accounts assert that the army then sold off the pieces to " a Jew from Syria " who transported them on the backs of " 900 camels . "
The Lighthouse ( Pharos ) of Alexandria
The Lighthouse of Alexandria was located on the ancient island of Pharos , just off the coast of the Egyptian city of Alexandria .
Designed by Sostratus of Cnidus in the third century B.C. , construction of the lighthouse did not begin until 305 B.C. , during the rule of Ptolemy Soter .
The lighthouse , constructed of large blocks of stones , reached a height of about 400 feet and was one of the tallest structures created by man for many centuries .
Initially the structure was intended only as a landmark for ships attempting to navigate into the harbor at Alexandria , but in the first century , the Romans transformed it into a lighthouse by lighting a fire at night and using reflecting mirrors during the day .
After 16 centuries guiding ships to safety , two earthquakes severely damaged the revered lighthouse .
And in 1480 , the Sultan of Egypt , Qaitbay , razed the remaining ruins and built a medieval fort on the site incorporating some of the original stone from the lighthouse .
Most BBS enthusiasts know that the last outpost for BBSes has been , for some time now , through telnet on the Internet .
There was a time , however , when when dial - up BBSes over analog phone lines were the rule , not the exception .
And believe it or not , there are still a handful of BBSes out there that have not modernized and switched over to the ‘ Net .
The only way you can get to them , though , is through an old fashioned analog phone modem , regular ole Ma Bell lines , and a little patience .
Visiting such old BBSes is incredible — it ’s like traveling back in time to the early - mid 1990s .
Each BBS is a unique a time capsule , stocked with trinkets and ephemera from the period .
On message boards , you ’ll find posts from 1994 about the O.J. Simpson trial and which player - made Doom levels are best .
In file transfer sections you ’ll run across large archives of long - forgotten Windows 3.1 screen savers .
In door sections ( online games ) , you ’ll find abandoned TradeWars 2002 games , still in progress , that have n’t been touched in eight years .
And of course , the Ferrengi have completely taken over .
These few remaining dial - up BBSes understandably receive very few calls these days , so they tend to feel a little eerie and lonely , like digital ghost towns .
Some of the message threads out there have been left hanging and incomplete , with the original post echoing like a thin , ghostly voice through time , still pleading for a response .
In some cases , it ’s as if an entire online community was caught unawares , swallowed up , and perfectly preserved in Pompeii - like ash .
Everything ’s there , in place … except the people .
Perhaps analogies to the Mary Celeste would be more appropriate .
All this makes me wonder why the Sysops who own these BBSes keep them running with such little traffic .
Did they just forget to turn off their machines in 1998 as the Internet finally swept away the traditional US BBS scene ?
Did the old Sysops die and nobody noticed that the automated machines were still running , undetected , in a dusty back room somewhere ?
The possibilities are incredibly compelling ; they really stir the imagination .
That ’s why finding such forgotten realms elicits a sense of discovery in me , like being an explorer discovering a long - lost temple in the overgrown jungles of Peru — all the more reason to give the old places a visit .
Time Travel , Vonage Style
The one thing that ’s kept me from revisiting these old BBSes , until now , is long distance phone charges .
There used to be so many BBSes that you could always find a local one in your area code , but that has n’t been true since 1998 .
You ’ll have to scour the continent ( courtesy of somewhat musty online BBS lists ) looking for dial - up BBSes that are still running .
Even then , you might be too late — often you ’ll find that the boards on the list have already been lost to the ages .
And unless you ’re really lucky , the boards that do work are almost always in another state — hence the long distance problem .
Enter the solution : I ’ve had phone service through Vonage for the last eight months .
For those of you who do n’t know , Vonage is a VoIP - based phone service that gives you a dedicated phone line in any area code you wish ( in the US ) , along with unlimited long distance to North America , incredibly cheap international call rates , call waiting , caller - ID , and all the bells and whistles .
No , this is not a commercial for Vonage , but you need to understand what it is .
I always wondered if Vonage , being tuned for voice communication ( hence the “ VoIP ” part ) , could handle data communication with an analog telephone modem .
I was concerned because modems , especially at higher speeds , probably generate some crazy fluctuations of tones that certain ( or most ? )
VoIP codecs might not be able to handle .
After successfully sending some faxes ( which typically transmit between 9600 bps and 14.4 kbps ) , I thought I ’d try my luck with a traditional data modem and a BBS .
“ Colossus ” in Virginia ( 703-818-8904 ) is a favorite BBS of mine because it ’s one of the few dial - up WWIV BBSes left out there ( WWIV is the software I ran myself back in the day ) .
Colossus is also unique in that it is likely the only BBS running vintage WWIV v4.24 that also has a working telnet connection ( for those of you who ’d like to try it out sans modem , here ’s your chance ) .
The reason why such a telnet connection is incredibly rare is because v4.24 was n’t designed to use a telnet connection — only a modem , so it requires some sophisticated tricks , obscure software , and a little OS / 2 magic to make it work .
Someday I hope to reproduce his accomplishment and put my old WWIV v4.24 BBS online through telnet .
But that ’s another story .
So I dialed up one of my favorite BBSes .
The connection was very laggy , but still usable if you know how to clench your teeth tightly enough .
There was a significant delay between what I typed and seeing it echoed back to me over the line .
An excerpt from this page on Experts Exchange gives some clue as to why this happens with VoIP lines :
The Vonage VoIP service has packetization at 20 ms intervals as standard .
You can phone up Vonage and get them to change this to 10 ms instead which should n’t affect the phone service but should allow the analog modem to work [ much better ] .
Phone tech support and ask them to change your packetization from 20 ms ( “ high ” ) to 10 ms ( “ normal ” ) .
You could also try adding * 99 to the beginning of the number you are dialling .
This tells Vonage to do the following for THE NEXT CALL ONLY :
1 ) Change packetization from 20ms to 10ms
2) Disable “ Bandwidth Saver ” ( gives the modem more bandwidth )
3 ) Uses codec G.711 ( good for data ) .
It seems the “ packetization rate ” of the VoIP connection has a lot to do with the lag I experienced .
Now if I truly understood exactly how all this “ packetization ” worked , I might be able to tell you exactly why it does what it does , but I do n’t ( doubtless , some one out there could fill us in with more detail ) .
All I know is that there is delay in encoding and decoding the data sent over the connection , which is understandable due to the technology involved .
I tried dialing * 99 in front of the number as suggested ( to force the line into “ fax mode ” ) , but it did n’t make any noticeable difference to me .
Latency problems aside , I still found the connection usable ( even if annoying at times ) , and the possibilities incredibly exciting .
Heck , with Vonage ’s cheap international call rates , maybe I could even find a dial - up BBS in China ?
Russia ?
South America ?
That would be incredible ( If anybody finds some working international BBS numbers , let me know ) .
Use of Vonage for dial - up BBSes has opened up whole new worlds to me … that are , ironically , also very old .
If you have Vonage — or even if you do n’t — I highly recommend trying it out at least once .
Fire up your dusty old computer , flip on your modem , and plug it into that neglected RJ - 11 port in the the wall ( or the Vonage box , depending on how you have it set up ) .
Oh , the joys of the derelict BBS !
Nothing really takes you back like working with Telix or PC Plus in DOS , full - screen , and hearing the old modem screech again , if only for one last time .
Update : Say it Ain’t So !
Breaking news .
Since I started writing this article , we ’ve lost another one .
🙁 Earlier this month , Colossus ’s Sysop , Dr. Forbin , announced that he was finally taking down the dial - up line .
It ’s sad news to me , but luckily Colossus ’s telnet line is still up and running if you ’d like to check it out .
Well , at least I got to experience the classic dial - up goodness of Colossus one last time before the end .
Nobody said these things would last forever .
Update ( 09/01/2006 ) : Have a BBS story yourself ?
Please consdier submitting it to my BBS Stories Archive .
Scott Murphy is a man who needs no introduction .
For 15 years , he stood on the forefront of the adventure gaming revolution at one of the biggest names in PC entertainment .
It was deep inside the lair of Sierra On - Line that Murphy and his crony Mark Crowe — known to the world as the Two Guys from Andromeda — created Space Quest , an adventure game franchise that has proven itself to be among the most enduring series the genre has to offer .
Exactly 20 years , 6 games , and 3 collections later , fans of Space Quest are still playing these and other games of his creation on their antiquated computers or with fan made emulators , all the while reminiscing about the rough and tumble days of gaming dominated by the graphic adventure .
Talk to almost every adventure game fan and there is a memory about Space Quest .
A quick search will reveal a laundry list of fan sites and fan games based on Space Quest that have sprung up over the years .
Countless numbers of fans count Space Quest among their all - time favorite game series , and the recent release of a new Space Quest compilation is expected to attract even more adventure games fans that now have the chance to relive the magic that is the wit and humor of the Two Guys from Andromeda .
Since his departure from Sierra On - Line , it has been nearly impossible to find out what has become of Murphy .
He has repeatedly declined or ignored media requests for interviews — a reluctance which , Murphy confesses , stems from Attention Deficit Disorder ( seriously ) .
He said ,
Still , there are those who continue to seek him out .
His email address — freely accessible through his neglected website — receives a steady flow of messages inquiring about him , and if the sender is lucky , they may receive a response .
However , until now all requests for interviews have gone denied .
When asked what made this time any different than all the rest , he said ,
Thus , I am able to present here the candid , unfiltered views of ' Scott Murphy ' to his fans ( and even non-fans ) to digest however they see fit .
These are raw , unabashed , unedited ideas , and if you are not careful you will surely be stunned .
A word of warning is warranted — there is a fair amount of cursing as well as some tough love .
If you have any history of heart conditions or are pregnant you may not wish to read further .
In the end , though , there is a great deal to be learned from life at the foot of this genius .
I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed asking the questions .
Also , be sure to check out our exclusive , never before seen online , photo of the man himself !
Okay , enough smarm already !
Let 's interview !
For those just tuning in , tell us a little bit about how you got started in the game development business and how you got started up at Sierra .
I did n't start out to make computer games my life 's work .
When I was in high school there was no such thing as a computer game , with the exception of Tic Tac Toe on a mainframe and Pong arcade games at bowling alleys .
It happened by accident .
Oakhurst at the time was a very seasonal location , relying on people coming through on their way to Yosemite from whom we would eke out a living .
I was raising a family and had found an actual year - round job cooking at a local dinner house .
My wife had lost her job at another restaurant when the guy running the place – allegedly ( oh , he did it ) – burned the place down one bored evening .
I had a friend named Doug Oldfield there who I 'd met through my then wife .
( A piece of important trivia ; Doug is one of the funniest people I 've ever met , much less worked with .
He is the actual creator of Astro Chicken and Ms. Astro Chicken , not to mention The Fun Seekers Guide to Eastern Madera County , " Grrr , let 's talk real estate ! " which was the first piece of game coding he ever did while learning the in - house language .
He was the original unofficial Third Guy from Andromeda , and I do n't think he ever got enough credit . )
After the fire , Doug sought out work and got a job at a fledgling company called On - Line Systems copying disks on state - of - the - art Apple ] [+ computers .
At the time , Ken [ Williams ] was a very generous guy and would allow employees to take computers home on the weekends .
Doug invited me over and showed me a few monochrome games they were selling at the time .
That 's when I saw my first adventure game and became very intrigued .
It was a game called Softporn by Chuck Benton , which eventually became Leisure Suit Larry 1 by Al " It does n't matter what you say about me , just spell my name right on the check " Lowe .
At the time , Space Invaders was the ultimate in computer entertainment technology .
That game got very boring really fast , and I hate how it ate all my quarters .
I also got tired of just shooting at things although that would change later when I contemplated a sideline as a sniper of corporate management types , but that 's another story I 'd rather not get into at this time so quit asking me about it , OK ?
Where was I ?
Oh yeah .
Anyway , I loved the adventure game .
I had an evening job I hated and I kept going to Sierra and bugging them until they let me come to work for them as a dealer returns person .
I kept learning things , became a support representative for games and then for business products , then I ended up managing the support department , blah , blah , blah .
Ultimately , Ken was hard - up for product when the company almost went down the crapper .
Mark and I had been cooped up together working on The Black Cauldron for the Disney movie by the same name .
I 'd conned Ken into letting me learn how to program adventure games in my off time , which meant being at his house from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am usually .
There was a puzzle in the game where you had to acquire some gruel .
I was rather tired one VERY early morning , and to amuse myself I installed a response message that said something like , " Mmmm , this tastes like freshly roasted mule shit , just like mom used to make . "
When I saw something I wrote actually displayed on the screen , I was totally f'ing hooked .
What I did n't know was that they were going to send that version of the game down to Disney for their perusal of our progress .
They saw that message and pretty much shit themselves .
Amazingly , I did n't get fired and Mark and I eventually came up with our space comedy idea and convinced Ken to let us develop it .
The rest is weird history .
You 've been absent from the gaming industry as far as anyone knows since being laid off by Sierra in 1999 's infamous " Chainsaw Monday " .
What have you been doing for food and living and keeping yourself occupied and stuff since then ?
I did n't actually lose my job on Chainsaw Monday .
I was dumped a month and a half previous to that .
I was a symbol of things to come , or go , as the case turned out to be .
I was pretty much a one trick pony , with that trick being adventure games , and since I was in school before the era of microcomputers , I had no formal education in computer science and companies then wanted people with diplomas which I did not have .
I was entirely self - taught and only have a high school diploma , and from a shitty high school at that .
Anyway , since that time was basically the death of the adventure game no jobs in that vein were to be had , so I had to resort to doing regular work like " normal " people .
Besides , I was a total burn - out by then .
I 'll never fit into that " normal " category , but I can do a relatively good impression of one , but eventually they find me out .
I 've had pretty boring jobs in office settings and the like .
I am currently living in the southeast , to where my mom and now - deceased step dad decided to retire .
Actually , it 's one of a couple of welcome mats for hurricanes once they 've entered the Gulf of Mexico .
I really miss earthquakes now .
I was in the northwest when Hurricane Ivan struck this area in the summer of 2004 .
My mom needed some help with taking care of her house as well as dealing with some health issues and that 's where I am now , in an area called ' The Redneck Riviera ' , and of course I mean that in only the nicest possible way .
( Shyeah , right . )
It 's been 20 years since the release of the very first Space Quest game and 10 years since the release of the last one .
What is your reaction to the cult following that manages to still exist after such a long time ?
I have honestly been stunned by it all , not to mention unbelievably gratified .
It 's a form of wealth to which mass quantities of buckazoids can not compare .
( However , if anyone DOES want to express their appreciation in that manner I will be glad to forward them my address . )
When we did the games the World Wide Web was in its infancy .
There was no email per se .
All you really had were things like text - based CompuServe bulletin boards which I did n't know jack shit about at the time since I did n't own a modem , and fans could only get in touch with me via snail mail , which I might note I was n't very good at responding to either .
By the way , this is a good time to apologize once again to all those kind souls that took the time out of their lives to write and express their feelings about the games and to whom I might never have responded to .
Seriously , years since the publishing of the last few games I still get a slow but steady trickle of email from those who seek me out , who played the games when they were kids and some who now , somewhat to my dismay , tell me they play them with their kids .
( Like I really need to be reminded of how friggin ' old I am ! )
Some have even accused the games of inspiring them to go to school and acquire gainful employment .
I 'm reluctant to take the blame for that .
On the upside , I get to realize that many have actually managed to get away from the keyboard to get laid , for which I applaud them .
Actually , I am , as I said , stunned not to mention overwhelmed by the appreciation and love they 've shown over these many years .
I honestly can't put in to words how much this has meant to me .
The fun we had making the games and royalties made way back then mean not nearly as much as what I 've gotten back from the fans and all the new friends I 've made so many places around the world .
I truly do love to hear from them .
The proliferation of Space Quest - related websites totally blew me away and a few diehard sites out there still make me feel great .
Chainsaw Monday obviously left a bitter taste in your mouth ( not to mention the mouths of the other 149 people who were laid off that day , the fans of the Sierra series , and anybody else who cared to look it up ) .
So many years later , are you still bitter about the situation or is it water under the bridge now ?
Yeah , that day sucked incredibly hard , but like I said , I 'd been laid off for about a month and a half .
The former workers that were my friends at Sierra were the ones who suffered the most .
My only bitterness about that particular chapter was in regard to the impact that had on their lives .
At that time I was doing alright .
I did n't realize how much pressure I 'd really been under and what a truly flaming ass pain dealing with Sierra management had become .
I mean , I knew it was bad but until I was gone I really , really did n't know how much I 'd gotten used to .
That made my leaving , regardless of how it happened , a total blessing in disguise .
I realized I 'd needed to leave a long time before that .
For me , it was water under the bridge a long time ago .
I know that my comrades in arms have long ago moved on and are doing well but I 'll never forget how roughly their lives were impacted despite the blood , sweat and tears they gave to what had become a truly ungrateful company .
The bitterness I posses is at what Sierra and Ken Williams had become as they became more and more successful , and how the Space Quest 6 abortion came about after broken promises and the just plain fucking over I got from the people I 'd worked so incredibly hard for .
The more successful each game became , the worse they treated us and the less they wanted to pay us .
I 'm not talking about us demanding more money like some sort of prima donnas .
They seemed like they were actually penalizing us for being successful for them .
They did n't want to pay us as much , which was n't a lot anyway , as they had for each of the previous games .
We 'd done well for them despite the fact that they spent virtually no money advertising the games , especially when you look at how much they hyped the King 's Quests .
I 'm quite proud of how we sold despite that .
On Space Quest 2 , I worked fourteen months and had only TWO days off during that period , but that was n't good enough for them .
I got called in and chewed out after that one and SQ3 for taking too long to get them shipped .
SQ4 showed how dark we 'd become as a result .
SQ's 5 and 6 were abysmal in my opinion and I 've felt some guilt about 6 , even though I inherited a game primarily designed by someone else based around that person 's game design around a lame joke on a title of another company 's game series , which was about as stupid an idea as I 've ever heard of .
What a nightmare that was , but that 's another story for another time , like maybe after the sweet angel of death comes to take me away .
And I did n't even work on SQ5 , so comments on " Roger Beamish " might be a little unfair , even though I did n't know it was even being made until I accidentally saw a beta version that had been sent down from Dynamix to one of the Oakhurst producers .
Believe me when I tell you that you truly did not want to see what Space Quest 7 would have been .
Please realize that this in absolutely no way reflects on the team that had been assigned to Space Quests 6 and 7 .
Leslie Balfour will forever have my gratitude for helping carry me in those final months .
She 's awesome and I hope she realizes I was never kidding when I expressed it to her .
( She might say otherwise about me , but still .... )
Everyone on the SQ6 team , with the exception of one programmer who will go unnamed at least for now , worked their asses off and I am grateful to them for hanging in there under some really fucked up circumstances .
I am truly proud of them and their contributions .
I want to give a special shout - out to William R. Shockley , Esq. for his hard work , which included covering for one dead - ass assigned to the team , not to mention the contributions he made above and beyond his job description .
And I mean these things regardless of what others might think of him . < gr >
Vivendi Universal ( Sierra 's current parent company ) has just repackaged and released a compilation of the Space Quest series ( as well as the King 's Quest series , the Police Quest series , and the Leisure Suit Larry series ) bundled with the fan - made emulator DOSBox and advertising these games as " XP Compatible " .
What 's your take on these new compilations ?
Did you know they existed ?
Are you getting any sort of residual or royalty for these releases ?
I did n't have a clue it was being put together until a fan told me about them a couple of months ago .
Vivendi Universal does n't give a crap about the makers of the games .
It 's just property to them .
I just paid for and got a copy from Amazon a couple of weeks ago but have n't had time to look at it .
One thing I do n't like about the compilation is that the original SQ1 is n't on it .
Instead , they included the remade version , which I think sucks donkeys .
Most of the " new " art was outsourced to Korea .
It has the basic game flavor in it but the " upgraded " art and interface sucks .
I loved the old parser interface because I felt I could have a lot more fun with the player , including insulting them based on their input .
I liked to surprise them when they thought that they 'd typed something in they did n't think there would be a response to other than a canned , " I do n't understand . "
And , no , I do n't get any royalties , but I am glad the games are out there for those who 've been asking me where they can get copies .
The compilation runs for little less than $ 20 US which I think is a pretty decent deal .
As you may or may not know , many fans post - Chainsaw Monday have taken it upon themselves to create new adventure games in lieu of their old favorites that have been abandoned by the copyright holders .
Some of these games are original works and many are remakes , sequels , or " lost chapters " to existing series .
Space Quest itself has a very large number of these projects to its name , including completed projects such as " The Lost Chapter " and " Replicated " as well as a fan Space Quest 7 that even boasts a story partially conceptualized by Associate from Andromeda Josh Mandel .
What do you think of these fan endeavors ?
Have you had a chance ( or a desire ) to look at some of the ones in production or play any of the completed ones ?
No offense to those who have worked so hard in the spirit of the games , but I am really not interested in checking them out .
The reason is that I have a vision of what Space Quest is and was and I really do n't want to have that messed with in any way .
However , I truly do appreciate their spirit and efforts .
I consider it quite a compliment that they would work so hard and expend so much time and energy .
I hope this is understood in the proper spirit .
Do you feel you accomplished what you set out to accomplish with the Space Quest series ?
If the rights ever reverted back to you through some magical twist of fate , would you be interested in teaming back up with Mark Crowe and the gang for another go - around ?
Overall , I feel pretty good about how the games came out .
When Mark and I started the games we decided that we wanted to make games WE would want to play , and I think we did that for the most part .
Would I want to work with Mark again ?
No , I do n't think so .
As I learned the hard way , Mark was not a very good partner in the long run .
When he decided to go to Sierra 's Dynamix division , he did n't have the decency to tell me he was leaving until we were headed to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show .
The only reason he told me then was that I was inevitably going to see him talking with Dynamix management personnel about the move while we were out there .
I lost a lot of respect for him , and then lost more when I learned some other things about him a couple of years later from people I am not at liberty to name who made me understand that he had loyalty to only himself .
I was really bummed to learn what he was really like , or what he'd become .
When we worked on the games together and did interviews I would compliment him to the media about how great he was at what he could do with a few pixels , that he was the best in the business , but never in my memory did ever say a single good thing about what I did , and I spent a hell of a lot more time on the games than he did , not to mention the VAST majority of the writing .
I was very disillusioned with him for that .
Looking back , what would you have liked to have included in Space Quest but were not able to ?
What do you think you would include in a Space Quest 7 if you were to make one today ?
What I really would have liked to do was to keep the original parser interface .
I think it made the games so much more deep .
There 's a back - story in my head that I would have liked to have gotten in .
I talked about it with Leslie Balfour when we were going through the motions on the ill - fated SQ7 .
It 's going to stay in my head , though , because without it being in the game , it would sound stupid , and not in a good way .
Here 's a little tidbit about how the parser interface went away and how management worked us .
One day when we 're literally halfway through SQ4 , Mark and I were called into Ken 's office .
We were asked what we thought about using the ( dumbass ) point - and - click interface that they were using , in I guess it was King 's Quest 5 then , and what we thought about putting it in SQ4 .
We said we wanted to keep the parser .
Ken and Bill Davis asked us to talk about it together and then tell them what we wanted to do the next day .
After the meeting , Mark and I agreed without hesitation as we walked out Ken 's office door that there was absolutely no way we wanted the point - and - click .
The next day when we came in , Bill Davis tracked Mark down and asked him what we 'd decided .
Mark told him that we 'd decided to keep the parser , to which Bill instantly replied something to the effect of , " But you ca n't do that .
Ken has already decided that you have to use the point - and - click ! "
Apparently they figured they had a fifty percent chance that we would make the decision and would n't realize that they 'd already made the decision for us .
That kind of mentality was another straw on the pile of last ones .
I feel it only fair that I should note that , having said that and some other things in this interview I want to point out that I have some good memories with Roberta , mainly because I did n't have to work for her .
She was the only person I knew in the early days that understood what the pressure was like to pull a game out of one 's ass on demand .
We had some really good talks and she was quite supportive .
She even took time out to do a cameo in a little video that Leslie Balfour and I put together for inclusion in the first Space Quest Collection , for which I was grateful .
She was the only one I could talk to about certain feelings involved in the creative process of adventure game design .
That mattered a lot to me and I consider her a friend to this day as oddly , based on certain things I have said here , I do Ken .
Away from work Ken was a completely different person and we enjoyed some good times together not to mention some fun and very interesting parties .
There were times when we had to blow off some steam from the pressure that we were all under in our various roles .
If any of this is taken in , say , not a good way by them or anyone else I mention , then the only thing that comes to mind is one of my favorite song lyrics by Don Henley , " Sometimes you get the best light from a burning bridge . "
Jane Jensen has recently announced her return to adventure game development with her production of " Gray Matter " , being developed by Tonuzaba and published by Anaconda .
Have you had any desire to return to the gaming industry since you left it ?
If so , what do you think you would do ?
I 've never given it a thought since I know that world has come and gone .
Adventure games have cult status .
Companies do n't have interest in the kind of money cult work might bring .
As for Jane , I really like her a lot .
I have a great deal of respect for her .
She 's incredibly talented and I wish her the best if that is actually still happening .
I hope she is successful because it may mean that there 's a change brewing , but I 'm not holding my breath ( although I should , given what I ate last night ) .
I truly enjoyed sharing an office with her .
She 's great at what she does and she 's a true writer .
She can totally design a game before a piece of artwork or code has been produced , and that 's what 's necessary to get a project green - lighted and financed .
Me , I 'm the kind of designer that likes to come up with a game idea , setting , feel , main character and a beginning and end point , and then fill in the middle as I go .
Seat - of – the - pants design , if you will .
( In fact , I insist that you call it that because I like my seat . )
It served me well .
That 's what we did with 1 - 4 for the most part .
In this day and age , structured budget and total design from start to finish are required before a dollar will be allocated , and still , you can't count on it working out to the end .
The fun has been sucked out of it .
Call me old - school , but that 's how I view it .
I do n't think I 'm at liberty to divulge any details about a recent adventure game project a friend was involved in developing , but they did quite a lot of work on it , months and months of work , and then the financing disappeared .
All that work down the drain .
I could n't subject myself to that .
I care too much about what I was doing to be able to handle that .
It would be devastating .
I would n't be able to endure that without telling someone in Al Qaeda that the financiers of the project had insisted the developers include disparaging images of the prophet Mohammed .
But that 's just me .
No adventure game interview would be complete without asking the clichéd question of the times .
What 's your opinion on the state of adventure gaming today ?
Do you ever find the time to play new games or have you taken yourself out of that circle ?
For me , simulators are the only things of interest at this time .
Oh , I 'll break out Doom or Castle Wolfenstein on the occasion when I really feel the urge to kill something that wo n't cause me to be incarcerated .
Call me old fashioned or old school or whatever .
I loved parsed adventure games .
They made me use my little grey cells and not just my thumb joint cartilage .
I can't imagine anything holding a candle to the first two Monkey Islands by Ron Gilbert , or The Prisoner written for – now I 'm really showing my age – the Apple ] [+ by the awesome David Mullich .
The Monkey Islands were so funny they made me soil myself , but they were n't as good once Ron left .
I was so depressed while working on SQ4 that I used to tuck myself away in my cubicle and play MI2 on company time when I was supposed to be working on SQ4 .
I can't believe my boss did n't wonder why I was actually in a good mood occasionally during that period .
( Ron even put in a poke at the stock Sierra character death sequence that made me spit up my gruel .
It was funny and well deserved .
However , I like to think of the Space Quest death sequences as an art form , so I really feel he was making fun of Roberta , etc . )
The Prisoner , it rocked my mind .
It was the first game I ever finished without any clues and I 've never felt that same sense of game play accomplishment since , no matter what I 've played .
The only disappointment I had with that game was once the realization set in that it was over .
I was steeped in great works light years beyond what 's available out there now .
No one has shown me that they have even an inkling of understanding or ability to create works on par with those .
I know I sound like an old fogy but I really do n't give a rat 's ass .
That stuff was pure genius .
Perhaps it would be kind of dated now , but still , nothing I see now has the impact of what those games had then in their time .
Is there any advice you can offer to those people sitting at home trying to develop a homebrew adventure game ?
Make something YOU'D want to play .
Listen to constructive criticism , but ultimately , stay true to your vision while at the same time checking your ego at the development door , and never ever believe that your code or design can't necessarily reek .
I worked with unnamed people who thought otherwise and saw what a huge mistake that is .
I KNOW I made most of the mistakes that can be made and learned all that the hard way .
I 'm just grateful the fans and critics were so forgiving .
What served me the best was staying true to my vision and realizing that , although I was making a game I 'd want to play , I was actually making something for others who would actually be plunking down their hard - earned buckazoids .
Give them something that will make them puke from the enjoyment .
Or not .
As Dennis Miller once said when he was still funny , " But that 's just my opinion , I could be wrong . "
Thanks ,
Scott , for giving me the chance to grill you .
How to Obscure Any URL
How Spammers And Scammers Hide and Confuse
Last Updated Sunday , 13 January 2002
NOTICE : the IP address of this site has changed of late , and I 've been unable to set aside time for the rather large task of revising this page .
Its numerous links to the old IP address wo n't work .
It 'll be updated soon !
The URL ( Universal Resource Locator ) of the page you are now viewing is http://www.pc-help.org/obscure.htm.
It is also http://3468664375@3468664375/o%62s%63ur%65%2e%68t%6D.
Go ahead and click on that link .
It 'll take you right back to this very page .
The weird - looking address above takes advantage of several things many people do n't know about the structure of a valid URL .
There 's a little more to Internet addressing than commonly meets the eye ; there are conventions which allow for some interesting variations in how an Internet address is expressed .
These tricks are known to the spammers and scammers , and they 're used freely in unsolicited mails .
You 'll also see them in ad- related URLs and occasionally on web pages where the writer hopes to avoid recognition of a linked address for whatever reason .
Now , I 'm making these tricks known to you .
Read on , and you 'll soon be very hard to fool .
( Note : Depending on your browser type and its version , some of the oddly - formatted URLs on this page may not work .
Also if you 're on a LAN and using a proxy [ gateway ] for Internet access , many of them are unlikely to work .
Also , fear not ; this page does not exploit the " Dotless IP Address " vulnerability of some IE versions . )
How It 's Done
Here it is again : http://3468664375@3468664375/o%62s%63ur%65%2e%68t%6D
First take note of the " @ " symbol that appears amid all those numbers .
In actual fact , everything between " http : / / " and " @ " is completely irrelevant !
Just about anything can go in there and it makes no difference whatsoever to the final result .
Here are two examples :
http://doesn'tmatter@www.pc-help.org /obscure.htm
http://!$^&*() _+`-={}|[ ]:;@www.pc-help.org/obscure.htm
Go ahead and use the links .
If they work at all with your browser , you 'll be back to this page again .
This feature is actually used for authentication .
If a login name and / or password is required to access a web page , it can be included here and login will be automatic .
Example : http://username:password@www.whatever.com /secret/eyesonly.htm
But if the page requires no authentication , the authentication text is in effect ignored by both browser and server .
This presents interesting possibilities for confusing the unsuspecting user .
How about this one :
http://www.playboy.com@3468664375/obscure.htm
If you did n't know better , you might think this page were at playboy.com !
By the way , the @ symbol can be represented by its hex code % 40 to further confuse things ; this works for the IE browser , but not for Netscape .
( Thanks to The Webskulker for this . )
All right , so what about that long number after the " @ " ?
How does 3468664375 get you to www.pc-help.org?
In actual fact , the two are equivalent to one another .
This takes a little explaining so follow me carefully here .
The first thing you need to know ( most Net users know this ) , is that Internet names translate to numbers called IP addresses .
An IP address is normally seen in " dotted decimal " format .
www.pc-help.org translates to 206.191.158.55 .
So of course , this page 's address can be expressed as : http://206.191.158.55/obscure.htm.
Numeric IP addresses are generally unrecognizable to people , and not easily rememberd .
That 's why we use names for network locations in the first place .
Merely using an IP address , in its usual dotted - decimal format , in place of the name is commonly done and can be quite effective at leaving the human reader in the dark about which website he 's visiting .
But there are other ways to express that same number .
The alternate formats are :
" dword " - meaning double word because it consists essentially of two binary " words " of 16 bits ; but it is expressed in decimal ( base 10 ) ;
because it consists essentially of two binary " words " of 16 bits ; but it is expressed in decimal ( base 10 ) ; " octal " , meaning it 's expressed in base 8 ; and
" hexadecimal " hexa=6 + deci=10 ( base 16 ) .
The dword equivalent of 206.191.158.55 is 3468664375 .
Its octal and hexadecimal equivalents are also illustrated below .
Why obscure names in the first place ?
Most often it 's because by publicly - available registration records , the owners of domain names can often be identified .
Even if the owner is n't traceable by that record , his service provider is .
The last thing any scammer or spammer wants is to be found by his victims , or to have his service provider alerted to his abuses .
Although the use of obscured URLs is far from their only means of avoiding retribution , it 's been a favorite .
Below , I explain how you can get an IP address for any name , how to convert a dotted - decimal IP address to the dword format , and how the octal and hex formats work .
If you know how it 's done , you will also know how it 's undone .
Okay , so what about the rest of the URL ?
Let 's look yet again at that weird address I first showed you :
http://3468664375@3468664375/o%62s%63ur%65%2e%68t%6D
It 's beginning to make some sense , is n't it ?
But what 's all that gibberish on the right ?
Here 's how that works :
Individual characters of a URL's path and filename can be represented by their numbers in hexadecimal form .
Each hex number is preceded by a " % " symbol to identify the following two numbers / letters as a hexadecimal representation of the character .
The practical use for this is to make it possible to include spaces and unusual characters in a URL .
But it works for all characters and can render perfectly readable text into a complete hash .
In my example , I have interspersed hex representations with the real letters of the URL .
It simply spells out " /obscure.htm " in the final analysis :
/ o %62 s %63 ur %65 % 2e %68 t %6D / o b s c ur e . h t m
The letters used in the hex numbers can be either upper or lower case .
The " slashes " in the address cannot be represented in hex ; nor can the IP address be rendered this particular way .
But everything else can be .
Hexadecimal Character Codes
Hex character codes are simply the hexadecimal ( base 16 ) numbers for the ASCII character set ; that is , the number - to - letter representations which comprise virtually all computer text .
To find the numeric value for an ASCII character , I often use a little batchfile I wrote for the purpose years ago ; and then if I want the hex equivalent I usually do the math in my head .
It just requires familiarity with the multiples of 16 up to 256 .
For most people , the conversion is probably best done with a chart .
The best ASCII - to - hex chart I have ever seen is on the website of Jim Price : http://www.jimprice.com/jim-asc.htm.
Jim explains the ASCII character set wonderfully well , and provides a wealth of handy charts .
I can't improve on Jim 's excellent work !
Print out Jim's ASCII - to - hex chart and you 're in business .
If Jim 's site ever disappears , let me know and I 'll do a chart of my own .
IP Addresses
IP addresses are most commonly written in the dotted - decimal format .
A dotted - decimal IP number normally has 4 numeric segments , each separated by a period .
The numbers must range from 0 to 255 .
Translation of a network name to its IP address is usually done in the background by your network software , invisible to the user .
Given a name , your browser queries a name server , a machine somewhere on the Net which performs this basic network addressing function ; it thereby obtains the numeric IP address and then uses that address to direct its requests to the right computer , somewhere out there on the Net .
There is a standard utility which allows the user to perform these name server lookups directly and see the results .
It 's called NSLOOKUP .
A wide variety of nslookup utilites is available on the Net , often for free download .
Some provide a graphical interface under Windows , but the original and most basic nslookup is run from a textual command line .
One such command - line utility is included in my free Network Tracer .
Please download it if you 're interested .
Place NSLOOKUP.EXE in your Windows directory and you can use it from a DOS window .
A simple nslookup query is structured as follows :
nslookup [ name or IP address ] [ name server ]
A name server has to be specified if you 're using Windows 9x / ME , either by name or IP address .
Find out the address of your ISP 's Primary DNS Server -- it can usually be found in your Dial - Up Networking setup or in the documents provided for setup of your Internet connection .
If you 're using XP or NT , the name server need not be specified .
A valid query for my ISP 's web server address would be :
nslookup www.nwi.net [ name server ]
Here 's what that command puts out in response , with my comments :
nslookup www.nwi.net 198.41.0.196 Server : ns.netsol.com
Address : 198.41.0.196
Non-authoritative answer : Name : sundance.nwinternet.com
Address : 206.159.40.2 Aliases : www.nwi.net primary name given to that address , but a valid one .
It 's a powerful utility ; it can find names for known addresses , addresses for known names , and a variety of other information relevant to an Internet address .
But doing some of the fancier things with NSLOOKUP is difficult if you 're not already technically savvy .
For the technically inclined , there is a manual ; and several examples of its use can be found in TRACE .
BAT , the primary component of my Network Tracer .
If you 're determined to avoid the DOS command line , and want a tool that will do most of the thinking for you , I recommend NetScanTools , a reasonably - priced network utility toolbox .
It 's available as a 30 - day shareware demo and a bargain at just $ 25 .
NetScanTools is not merely an address - lookup utility ; it can do a great many things .
For a Windows user trying to comprehend the nuts and bolts of the Net , it 's a whole world of discovery .
You can also do your name server lookups with a web browser .
There are nslookup " gateways " scattered around on the Web .
One such gateway is at : http://www.lasaltech.com/cgi-bin/nslookup
Another is : http://www.interlog.com/~patrick/cgi/nslookup.cgi
A Variation on Dotted - Decimal IPs
If you 're using Internet Explorer , this address should work ( It does n't work with at least some versions of Netscape ) : http://462.447.414.311/obscure.htm
Normally , the four IP numbers in a standard dotted - decimal address will all be between 0 and 255 .
In fact they must translate to an 8 - bit binary number ( ones and zeroes ) , which can represent a quantity no higher than 255 .
But the way this number is handled by some software often allows for a value higher than 255 .
The program uses only the 8 right - hand digits of the binary number , and will drop the rest if the number is too large .
This means you can add multiples of 256 to any or all of the 4 segments of an IP address , and it will often still work .
In my tests , it was limited to 3 digits per number ; values over 999 did n't work .
Converting An IP Address to Dword Format
I could create a math lesson about this , and tell you all about bits and bytes and base 16 .
But it 's not really necessary .
Anyone with a Windows system has a handy calculator that makes it simple to convert decimal numbers to hex , and to find the dword equivalent of any dotted - decimal IP number .
You should find it by selecting Start ...
Programs ... Accessories ... Calculator .
It will look like this :
or , in Scientific mode , it looks like this :
I suggest Scientific mode for this purpose .
Start with an IP address .
In this example we 'll use 206.191.158.55 .
Enter the following keystrokes into the calculator exactly as shown : 206 * 256 + 191 = * 256 + 158 = * 256 + 55 =
The dword equivalent of the IP address will be the result .
In this case , 3468664375 .
Now , there is a further step that can make this address even more obscure .
You can add to this dword number , any multiple of the quantity 4294967296 ( 2564 ) -- and it will still work .
This is because when the sum is converted to its basic digital form , the last 8 hexadecimal digits will remain the same .
Everything to the left of those 8 hex digits is discarded by the IP software and therefore irrelevant .
Thus , the following URLs will also lead to this page :
http://7763631671/obscure.htm
http://16353566263/obscure.htm
http://235396898359/obscure.htm
There now exist a handful of utilities that will do dword ( and other ) conversions of IP addresses and URLs .
When time permits , I 'll be sure to list them on this page .
Meanwhile , there 's a handy script on Matthias Fichtner 's website which will quickly convert any IP address to its dword value and vice - versa : http://www.fichtner.net/tools/ip2dword/.
PING
The PING utility that 's in every Windows system can decipher dword IPs .
In fact , it deals with every method of expressing an IP address that 's described on this page .
( My thanks to Steven , who pointed this out on the NTBugTraq list . )
Just open a DOS window and type :
ping [ IPAddress ]
PING will then do its usual job , in which it contacts the remote system ( if any ) at that address and gauges its response times .
In the process , it displays the ordinary dotted - decimal equivalent of the IP address you entered .
Octal IP Addresses
As if all this were n't enough , an IP address can also be represented in octal form -- base 8 .
The URL for this page with its IP address in octal form looks like this : http://0316.0277.0236.067/obscure.htm
Go ahead , try it .
You 'll be right back here once again ..
Note the leading zeroes .
They 're necessary to convey to your browser the fact that this is an octal number .
Any number of leading zeroes can be added to any or all of the numbers in the address .
For example : http://00000000316.000277.00000236.00000000067/obscure.htm
Naturally , arbitrary authentication text can also be added to an octal address .
Example : http://www.sleazy-ad.com@00000000316.000277.00000236.00000000067/obscure.htm
Octal numbers are easily derived with the Windows calculator in Scientific mode .
Enter a decimal number , then select the " Oct " button at upper left .
The octal number will appear .
The reverse operation translates octal to decimal .
( Those who find all this unwieldy can always use the handy URLomatic at www.samspade.org.
It will reveal the dotted - decimal IP address of a dword - or octal - formatted URL , as well as to decode hex character codes .
This link to the URLomatic will completely decipher my original example address .
Many thanks to Dan Renner of R&B Computerhelp ) .
Hexadecimal IP Addresses
You thought that was all ?
Well , so did I , until one Daniel Doèekal informed me otherwise .
There is yet another obscure way to express an IP address .
Starting with the method outlined above , you can readily calculate the hexadecimal number for 206.191.158 .
55 .
In Scientific mode , calculate the dword value .
Then select the Hex button .
The resulting hexadecimal number ( CEBF9E37 ) can be expressed as an IP address in this manner : 0xCE.0xBF.0x9E.0x37
The " 0x " designates each number as a hex quantity .
The dots can be omitted , and the entire hex number preceded by 0x : 0xCEBF9E37
And , additional arbitrary hex digits can be added to the left of the " real " number : 0x9A3F0800CEBF9E37
Some browsers ( Netscape 3.x and 4.x for instance ) wo n't work with hex IPs ; but for IE users ( prior to version 6 ) , this page 's URL can be :
http://0xCE.0xBF.0x9E.0x37/obscure.htm
or :
http://0xCeBF9e37/obscure.htm
or :
http://0x9A3F0800CEBF9E37/obscure.htm
It 's Not Over Yet
Ah , you thought you had it all nailed down ?
Well , it 's mix - and - match time !
Believe it or not , the following URL , which uses hex , decimal and octal numbers in the IP address , actually works : http://0xCE.191.0236.0x37/obscure.htm
This mixed - format address also works with bogus authentication text : http://spam-world.net@0xCE.191.0236.0x37/obscure.htm

» Current justices | Chief justice duties | Court appointments | Special GOP sets up showdown over Alito Massachusetts senators try ' uphill ' filibuster push RELATED QUICKVOTE
Why do you think John Kerry wants to filibuster Samuel Alito ?
Conviction Politics or View Results SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Supreme Court Samuel Alito or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate 's top Republican decided Thursday to force a showdown on Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito early next week , with the two Democratic senators from Massachusetts pushing to block a vote .
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist filed a motion to cut off debate on the Alito nomination after his Democratic counterpart , Minority Leader Harry Reid , objected to a move by GOP leaders to schedule a final vote on his confirmation Monday afternoon .
Frist 's motion , which requires 60 votes under Senate rules , will come up for a vote at 4:30 p.m. Monday .
If successful , senators will then vote on Alito 's nomination at 11 a.m. Tuesday , with a simple majority of 51 votes needed for approval .
( How a filibuster works ) Frist 's move came as Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts was lobbying his Democratic colleagues to filibuster the Alito nomination -- an uphill fight , given that none of the chamber 's 55 Republicans has opposed his confirmation and three Democrats are on the record supporting it .
" Judge Alito 's confirmation would be an ideological coup on the Supreme Court , " Kerry said in a written statement .
" We can't afford to see the court 's swing vote , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , replaced with a far - right ideologue like Samuel Alito . "
( Watch Kerry 's political gamble -- :50 ) The White House expressed confidence that Alito 's supporters had the 60 votes needed to cut off a filibuster , a maneuver allowed under Senate rules to block a vote by extending debate indefinitely .
Earlier Thursday , Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin , who is in charge of rounding up his colleagues for key votes , also played down the possibility of a filibuster , though he said no decision had been made .
" One of the first responsibilities of someone in Congress is to learn how to count , " the Illinois Democrat said .
" Having made a count , I have come to the conclusion it is highly unlikely that a filibuster would succeed . "
Democrats split Two Democrats announced Thursday that they would vote for the 55 - year - old Alito : Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Sen. Tim Johnson of South Dakota .
Both represent states that Bush carried in the 2004 presidential election .
In a speech on the Senate floor , Byrd , the longest - serving Democrat in the Senate , said he refused " simply to toe the party line when it comes to Supreme Court justices . "
" My considered judgment ... leads me to believe [ Alito ] to be an honorable man , a man who loves his country , loves his Constitution and a man who will give of his best , " said Byrd , who faces re-election in November .
" Can we really ask for more ? "
Johnson said that while he was " troubled " by some of Alito 's views , " I cannot accept an argument that his views are so radical that the Senate is justified in denying his confirmation . "
He also said he would oppose any filibuster of the nomination .
Sources close to Kerry , who lost to Bush in the 2004 race , told CNN that the senator was calling colleagues from Switzerland , where he was attending the World Economic Forum .
He announced his decision to support a filibuster Wednesday at a meeting of his Democratic colleagues .
The White House believes Alito 's supporters have the 60 votes they need to block any filibuster , spokesman Steve Schmidt said , and suggested that Kerry 's move was designed to buttress a possible 2008 presidential run .
Bush said Thursday he was looking forward to an " up - or - down vote " in the Senate and praised Alito , a judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , as a man of " character and integrity . "
Bush tapped Alito for the job after his White House counsel , Harriet Miers , withdrew her nomination .
Republicans and the White House are pushing to have the final vote before Bush gives his State of the Union speech January 31 , Senate sources have said .
' Vote of a generation ' Massachusetts Sen .
Ted Kennedy also said Thursday he would support a filibuster , though he described it as " an uphill climb . "
" This is a vote of a generation and a test of conscience , " Kennedy said in a statement .
" Judge Alito does not share the values of equality and justice that make this country strong .
He does not deserve a place on the highest court of the land . "
In the floor debate of Alito 's nomination , other Democrats have been highly critical of the nomination , saying he would threaten civil liberties and fail to act as a check on executive power .
Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont , the Judiciary Committee 's ranking Democrat , had supported Chief Justice John Roberts ' nomination last fall .
But this time , he said , " I am concerned that if we confirm this nominee it will further erode the checks and balances " between the branches of government .
Kennedy told reporters that at least five Democrats are on board supporting the filibuster , and he said he expects others to join the effort .
In addition to Byrd and Johnson , Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska has said he will support Alito .
Earlier Thursday , Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana said she would oppose a filibuster .
With their support , and with the 55 Senate Republicans expected to oppose any filibuster , GOP leaders would need to find only one more Democrat to thwart a filibuster attempt .
In May , Byrd , Nelson , Landrieu and four other Democrats joined seven Republicans in agreeing to oppose Democratic filibusters of some Bush judicial nominees and any attempt by Republican leaders to change Senate rules to end the practice , except under " extraordinary circumstances . "
So far , that agreement has held .
The other Democrats in the group , known as the " Gang of 14 , " are Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , Daniel Inouye of Hawaii , Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Ken Salazar of Colorado .

Interoperability and DRM Are Mutually Exclusive
Earlier this month , the British Phonographic Industry — the organization that collectively represents record labels in the United Kingdom ( i.e. the British equivalent of the RIAA ) — granted explicit permission to Britons to rip music from CDs to digital formats suitable for use on portable music players .
Yes , that ’s right : until earlier this month , anyone in Britain who copied music from their own CDs to an iPod ( or any other digital player ) did so under the threat of prosecution .
British copyright laws do not contain the same fair use provisions that we enjoy here in the United States .
In a statement issued before the House of Commons Select Committee for Culture , Media , and Sport , BPI Chairman Peter Jamieson said :
“ Traditionally the recording industry has turned a blind eye to private copying and has used the strength of the law to pursue commercial pirates .
“ We believe that we now need to make a clear and public distinction between copying for your own use and copying for dissemination to third parties and make it unequivocally clear to the consumer that if they copy their CDs for their own private use in order to move the music from format to format we will not pursue them . ”
That ’s good news .
Common sense has not fared well in our current copyright wars .
Common sense evaporates , however , with Jamieson ’s statements regarding Apple and the iTunes Music Store .
Jamieson acknowledges the huge contribution Apple has made to the development of the download business and the enormous appeal of its integrated hardware and software .
However , when asked about iTunes dominant market share in downloads , Jamieson said , “ It ’s not particularly healthy for any one company to have such a dominant share . ”
iPods currently only play unprotected MP3 files , such as those ripped from CDs , or songs downloaded from the iTunes Music Store .
It applies its own Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) to the downloads it sells , that prevents them from being compatible with non-iPod music players .
The DRM also prevents downloads purchased from most other legal download services , such as Napster and HMV Digital , from playing on iPods .
Jamieson called on Apple to open up its software in order that it is compatible with other players .
“ We would advocate that Apple opts for interoperability , ” he said .
What they ’re advocating makes no sense .
What , exactly , would “ interoperability ” entail ?
Apple could license FairPlay to other device manufacturers .
This is certainly possible , but one would presume , however , that Apple would only provide such licenses for a fee .
And thus this would not effectively reduce the dominant position Apple currently holds in the legal download market .
They ’d just be in a position similar to Microsoft ’s in the PC operating system market .
Or , Apple could modify iTunes and iPods to play DRM - protected Windows Media files , like the ones from Napster and HMV Digital and dozens of other also - ran legal download sites .
Maybe even to reduce confusion , they could just shutter the ITMS and abandon FairPlay .
Then instead of Apple ’s technology dominating the legal download market , it ’d be Microsoft ’s , and I ’m sure that ’d be great for everyone .
Apple ca n’t “ just play music from other stores ” ; the whole point of DRM is that there ’s secret juju encrypting the data in the files .
To play them , Apple would have to obtain a license from Microsoft , and you ’re just fucking nuts if you think Apple is going to do that .
Microsoft charges money for these licenses , and Apple would be forever after beholden to Microsoft for continuing DRM licensing .
I ’m not disagreeing that Apple ’s dominance is unhealthy for the industry .
But the executives in the record industry — on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean , apparently — are too ignorant to realize that what they want is technically impossible .
The industry ’s idea of a “ perfect ” DRM scheme is one that is not controlled by either Apple or Microsoft , and which gives only them ( the record industry ) complete control over what users can do with their downloads .
Such a scheme does not exist , and it does not exist because it is n’t possible .
But interoperability already exists : you get it with MP3 files , and any other non-DRM - laden file formats .
So what Apple could do to achieve ITMS interoperability is simply remove the DRM from the music it sells via ITMS and deliver the files in non-encrypted AAC format .
Users would be happy , as they ’d get files unencumbered by FairPlay restrictions .
The manufacturers of other digital music players would be happy , because AAC is an ISO standard .
[ Update : I made a significant mistake in the above paragraph , having originally described AAC as an “ open format ” which does n’t require licensing fees .
It is not .
It is an ISO standard , but it ’s encumbered by patents and anyone who writes encoding or decoding software is required to pay licensing fees .
The error is doubly embarrassing considering all the recent attention on issues relating to openness .
My apologies . ]
But that ’s not what the music industry wants .
Yes , there exist legal download stores that sell music in MP3 format ( e.g. eMusic.com ) — but they do n’t have content from the major record labels , because the major record labels refuse to allow their music to be sold for download without DRM .
The music industry ’s insistence upon DRM is what put the ITMS in the position that Apple now enjoys ; the record industry is decrying a lock - in advantage that they themselves handed to Apple so they could deny their customers ( i.e. us , the people who listen to music ) the interoperability they now say they want .
It is possible that even if the major record labels were to allow legal downloads of non-DRM - laden music that Apple would resist , out of the selfish desire to maintain the lock - in advantage that FairPlay ’s DRM provides .
But at least it would give the record industry a principle to stand upon :
We call upon Apple to open the iTunes Music Store by removing the DRM , and Apple is refusing .
And they could more or less force Apple ’s hand by permitting other download stores to distribute music in iPod - compatible non-DRM formats .
Record industry executives refuse to believe what is patently obvious to anyone with a clue — they are never ever going to regain complete control over the distribution of recorded music .
They so desperately want this that they believe it must be possible , but the very nature of DRM is that it is diametrically opposed to interoperability .
What ’s most infuriating is how the mainstream media plays along with the entertainment industry , parroting their calls for nonsensical “ DRM interoperability ” as though it ’s all perfectly reasonable .
Calling for “ interoperability ” without any practical suggestion as to how it could be achieved is just an empty platitude .
It ’s like demanding “ a cheap source of energy ” or “ a cure for cancer ” .
But unlike the energy problem or cancer , digital media interoperability is not an intractable problem .
There ’s an obvious solution staring everyone in the face .

Almost total relief of symptoms tempered by hints of cancerous side effects .
A rat 's movement troubles can be almost completely cured with transplants of fresh neurons .

The symptoms of Parkinson 's disease have been relieved in rats using a stem - cell treatment .
But a potentially cancerous side effect might put the brakes on such therapies for humans .
Parkinson 's disease kills off neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine , leading to problems with movement and balance .
Most treatments currently involve replenishing the dopamine through drugs .
But researchers are keen to develop longer - term solutions , using embryonic stem cells to make replacement dopamine neurons .
But it has so far proved difficult to produce enough of the right kind of cell ; there are several types of dopamine neuron , and only some of them will do the job .
" Not all dopamine neurons are created equal , " says Steve Goldman of Cornell University Medical College , New York , who leads the study .
Goldman and his colleagues now report in Nature Medicine1 that they have found a way to make the right type — neurons of a part of the brain called the substantia nigra , which send signals to cells involved in generating movement .
Grow your own
Goldman and his team took human fetal midbrain tissues , in which dopamine cells are made , and extracted glial cells , whose normal role is to support and maintain the growth of neurons .
They then cultured stem cells in this glia - rich environment .
" What we were really trying to do was to mimic the environment of the developing brain to increase the efficiency of dopamine - neuron generation , but also to bias the cells towards generating the type of dopamine neurons that we wanted , " says Goldman .
The technique worked .
When the new dopamine neurons were transplanted into the brains of rats with the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease , the animals recovered almost entirely .
" The positive results were really remarkably strong , " Goldman says .
" The animals exhibited almost a complete restoration of normal function . "
But there could be alarming side effects .
Each stem - cell transplant also contained cells that had failed to become neurons , and which remained undifferentiated .
These cells keep dividing , and can turn into tumours , says Goldman .
( The rats in the study were killed before any such tumours developed . )
Small steps
Embryonic stem - cell treatments are known to have this potentially killer side effect .
To avoid it , the cells will need to be sorted and the differentiated ones isolated , says Olle Lindvall , a neurologist at University Hospital in Lund , Sweden .
Goldman 's team is already working on this .
It will be several years before clinical trials of stem - cell approaches to Parkinson 's disease can proceed , says Lindvall .

In the meantime , others are working on using gene therapy to stimulate neurons already present in the brain to produce more dopamine .
This week , an American biotechnology company called Neurologix reported successful , preliminary trials of this technique .
They introduced a harmless virus , equipped with a gene involved in the dopamine system , into the brains of patients .
All showed an improvement of at least 25 % in their symptoms .
But gene therapy too comes with a host of problems , including learning how to properly regulate the new genes , and the improvement is n't as dramatic as seen with the stem - cell approach .
Goldman is cautious , but optimistic , about both .
" Neither gene therapy nor stem cells are ready for primetime , " he says .

The Wafer Test Fixture that the researchers used to test the new porous - silicon diode and its interactions with tritium gas .
The diode is the dark wafer in the center of the top plate .
A new type of battery based on the radioactive decay of nuclear material is 10 times more powerful than similar prototypes and should last a decade or more without a charge , scientists announced this week .
The longevity would make the battery ideal for use in pacemakers or other surgically implanted devices , developers say , or it might power spacecraft or deep - sea probes .
You might also find these nuclear batteries running sensors and other small devices in your home in a few years .
Such devices " do n't consume much power , " said University of Rochester electrical engineer Philippe Fauchet , " and yet having to replace the battery every so often is a real pain in the neck . "
Fauchet told LiveScience the batteries could last a dozen years .
They 're being refined at Rochester .
The technology was developed with the help financial support from the National Science Foundation and has been patented by BetaBatt Inc .
How it works
The technology is called betavoltaics .
It uses a silicon wafer to capture electrons emitted by a radioactive gas , such as tritium .
It is similar to the mechanics of converting sunlight into electricity in a solar panel .
Until now , betavoltaics has been unable to match solar - cell efficiency .
The reason is simple :
When the gas decays , its electrons shoot out in all directions .
Many of them are lost .
" For 50 years , people have been investigating converting simple nuclear decay into usable energy , but the yields were always too low , " Fauchet explained .
" We 've found a way to make the interaction much more efficient , and we hope these findings will lead to a new kind of battery that can pump out energy for years . "
Fauchet 's team took the flat silicon surface , where the electrons are captured and converted to a current , and turned it into a three - dimensional surface by adding deep pits .
Each pit is about one micron wide .
That 's four ten - thousandths of an inch .
They 're more than 40 microns deep .
Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen .
Mixed with chemicals that emit light , it is used to illuminate exit signs without electricity -- the sort commonly found in schools and other public buildings .
" It is safe and can be implanted in the body , " Fauchet said .
" The energetic particles emitted by tritium do not penetrate inside the skin . "
Tritium emits only low energy particles " that can be shielded by very thin materials , such as a sheet of paper , " said Gadeken of BetaBatt .
" The hermetically - sealed , metallic BetaBattery cases will encapsulate the entire radioactive energy source , just like a normal battery contains its chemical source so it cannot escape . "
The device is detailed in today 's issue of Advanced Materials .
Improvements needed
The manufacturing process is standard to the semiconductor industry , so no other technology breakthroughs are needed to bring the batteries to market .
Still , do n't expect anything on the store shelves for at least two years , Fauchet said .
His team is now working to improve the manufacturing process , aiming for batteries many times more efficient than those announced today .
" If we are as successful as we think we may be , it will take less than five years before this technology is adopted , " he said .
Graduate student Wei Sun of the University of Toronto was lead author on the paper describing the work .

Oregon man survives 12 nails to the head PORTLAND , Ore. ( AP ) 
An Oregon man who went to a hospital complaining of a headache was found to have 12 nails embedded in his skull from a suicide attempt with a nail gun , doctors say .
Surgeons removed the nails with needle - nosed pliers and a drill , and the man survived with no serious lasting effects , according to a report on the medical oddity in the current issue of the Journal of Neurosurgery .
The unidentified 33 - year - old man was suicidal and high on methamphetamine last year when he fired the nails — up to 2 inches in length — into his head one by one .
The nails were not visible when doctors first examined the man in the emergency room of an unidentified Oregon hospital a day later .
Doctors were surprised when X - rays revealed six nails clustered between his right eye and ear , two below his right ear and four on the left side of his head .
The study did not say how long the nails were , and a hospital spokeswoman refused to release that information .
A photo published in the study suggests the nails range from 1 1/2 to 2 inches long .
No one before is known to have survived after intentionally firing so many foreign objects into the head , according to the report , written by Dr. G. Alexander West , the neurosurgeon who oversaw the treatment of the patient .
The man at first told doctors he had had a nail gun accident , but later admitted it was a suicide attempt .
The nails came close to major blood vessels and the brain stem but did not pierce them .
The patient was in remarkably good condition when he was transferred to Oregon Health & Science University in Portland , where the nails were removed .
The patient was later transferred to psychiatric care and stayed under court order for nearly a month before leaving against doctors ' orders .

When historians come to write the definitive account of the rise of the liberal blog in the US , it is quite possible they will identify a small meeting in Harlem this week as a tipping point .
The gathering looked unremarkable enough , a group of about 20 men and women sitting round a boardroom table , but it represented something highly significant .
The people assembled were the elite , if that 's not a contradiction in terms , of the Democrat - leaning blogosphere .
And the man at the centre was Bill Clinton .
Over a two - hour lunch of southern chicken , sweet potato fries , cornbread and cherry cake ( " our plates were clean at the end " , noted the blogger from Talkleft ) , the conversation ranged widely across Iraq , healthcare , energy and tax .
But it kept coming back to a central theme : the growing strength and confidence of the liberal blogs .
Clinton told the group that over the past two years he had become an avid reader , and that he now included blog posts in his daily news cuttings service .
For the bloggers , toiling away in their front rooms , it was heady stuff .
" Here I was with a group of my friends and colleagues , meeting with one of our nation 's presidents because our small , do - it - yourself political operation had drawn his attention , " writes Chris Bowers on the MyDD blog .
" I mean , this is largely work I have completed from the bedroom of my apartment in West Philly . "
Coming of age
To be bathed in the famously energising glow of the former president 's attention is an unfamiliar sensation .
Ever since blogs took off in America three or four years ago , the running has been made by writers and editors from the right such as Andrew Sullivan , Michelle Malkin and Glenn Reynolds , the law professor behind InstaPundit .
Liberal sites were confined to the role of second cousins .
So the Clinton meeting was a much - needed pat on the back .
Bill Scher , who edits the Liberal Oasis blog , thinks they are now emerging as real forces .
" Right - wing blogs have been very good and very fast at putting out misinformation .
What we are now learning to do is to be better than that - to put out good information faster than they do and accurately so that it cannot be rebutted . "
Scher 's book , Wait !
Do n't move to Canada , is published next week .
It records how liberal blogs first came to public attention when they raised substantial amounts of money for the 2004 primary campaign of the anti-Iraq war Democrat , Howard Dean .
Now they have moved a step beyond that .
" We are no longer dismissed as just ATMs for the Democrats - now people have to listen to what we say . "
ABC television had to listen to what the liberal blogs had to say this week .
It came a cropper over a two - part docu- drama about the lead - up to September 11 , The Path to 9/11 , which portrayed the counter - terrorism efforts of the Clinton administration in a poor light .
One blog , Think Progress , exposed inaccuracies in the show , or " crockudrama " as left bloggers dubbed it .
The site 's editor , Judd Legum , became aware of the contents of the drama when rightwing bloggers and the radio host Rush Limbaugh began talking about it .
" They had evidently been passed copies of the movie and that alerted us to it . "
Legum started investigating the drama about 10 days before it was scheduled for broadcast , identifying the most egregious mistakes and researching and compiling rebuttals .
He enlisted the help of the site 's army of bloggers and within days he had ignited a firestorm that enveloped ABC and brought Clinton and several of his former aides into the furore .
" You could watch it build exponentially , " Legum told the Guardian . "
First we had seven mentions on cable TV , then 40 , then 300 , then 400 .
It just took off . "
In the end , ABC was forced to re-edit several of the disputed scenes .
It removed passages suggesting Clinton had been distracted from the emerging threat of al - Qaida by his obsession with Monica Lewinsky ; it reined in a critical depiction of Clinton 's former secretary of state Madeleine Albright ; and it cut out a shot of Sandy Berger , the former national security adviser , slamming down the phone on a CIA operative who was pleading to be allowed to attack Osama Bin Laden .
So has the leftwing blog finally come of age ?
Peter Daou thinks this week 's events suggest that it is moving in the right direction .
" The Clinton meeting and the Path to 9/11 both put down a marker . "
Daou advised John Kerry during his 2004 presidential bid on how to reach out to bloggers .
He has recently taken up a similar role for Hillary Clinton , acting as a go - between in her campaign to be re-elected to the Senate in November .
" There have been tensions and growing pains , and at times a lot of elbowing and jockeying for position , " he said .
" But we are on the way to building a new centre of power politics in America . "

With a staff of just five , Think Progress punches well above its weight , as was seen by the impact it had on the ABC docudrama , The Path to 9/11 .
It is connected to the Washington - based liberal thinktank , the Centre of American Progress , whose director is the former chief of staff under Bill Clinton .
It has about 100,000 visitors a day , and its focus is on monitoring rightwing blogs and the mainstream media .
It calls itself a movement of " guerrilla fact checkers " .

What drink is best for getting and staying hydrated during exercise ?
Should you choose water ?
Are sports drinks best ?
What about juice or carbonated soft drinks ?
Coffee or tea ?
Beer ?
Water
The natural choice for hydration is water .
It hydrates better than any other liquid , both before and during exercise .
Water tends to be less expensive and more available than any other drink .
You need to drink 4 - 6 ounces of water for every 15 - 20 minutes of exercise .
That can add up to a lot of water !
While some people prefer the taste of water over other drinks , most people find it relatively bland and will stop drinking water before becoming fully hydrated .
Water is the best , but it only helps you if you drink it .
Sports Drinks
Sports drinks do n't hydrate better than water , but you are more likely to drink larger volumes , which leads to better hydration .
The typical sweet - tart taste combination does n't quench thirst , so you will keep drinking a sports drink long after water has lost its appeal .
An attractive array of colors and flavors are available .
You can get a carbohydrate boost from sports drinks , in addition to electrolytes which may be lost from perspiration , but these drinks tend to offer lower calories than juice or soft drinks .
Juice
Juice may be nutritious , but it is n't the best choice for hydration .
The fructose , or fruit sugar , reduces the rate of water absorption so cells do n't get hydrated very quickly .
Juice is a food in its own right and it 's uncommon for a person to drink sufficient quantities to keep hydrated .
Juice has carbohydrates , vitamins , minerals , and electrolytes , but it is n't a great thirst quencher .
Carbonated Soft Drinks
When you get right down to it , the colas and noncolas of the world are n't good for the body .
The acids used to carbonate and flavor these beverages will damage your teeth and may even weaken your bones .
Soft drinks are devoid of any real nutritional content .
Even so , they taste great !
You are more likely to drink what you like , so if you love soft drinks then they might be a good way to hydrate .
The carbohydrates will slow your absorption of water , but they will also provide a quick energy boost .
In the long run , they are n't good for you , but if hydration is your goal , soft drinks are n't a bad choice .
Avoid drinks with lots of sugar or caffeine , which will lessen the speed or degree of hydration .
Coffee and Tea
Coffee and tea can sabotage hydration .
Both drinks act as diuretics , meaning they cause your kidneys to pull more water out of your bloodstream even as the digestive system is pulling water into your body .
It 's a two - steps - forward - one - step - back scenario .
If you add milk or sugar , then you reduce the rate of water absorption even further .
The bottom line ?
Save the latte for later .
Alcoholic Beverages
A beer might be great after the game , as long as you were the spectator and not the athlete .
Alcohol dehydrates your body .
Alcoholic beverages are better for hydration than , say , seawater , but that 's about it .
The bottom line : Drink water for maximum hydration , but feel free to mix things up a bit to cater to your personal taste .
You will drink more of what you like .
In the end , the quantity of liquid is the biggest factor for getting and staying hydrated .

If an investigator determines the I.P. address used by a suspect , he can subpoena the Internet provider for the identity of the user associated with that address at a particular date and time .
For example , in investigating a bomb threat at a Canadian high school in 2002 , Mr. Ohm approached the operator of a message board in California on which the threats were placed .
He asked to review the log monitoring each user 's activities , which showed the Internet Protocol address of the person who left the threatening message .
Mr. Ohm used that address in turn to determine the suspect 's Internet service provider , who identified a teenager who had posted the message .
( As a minor , he was not prosecuted . )
While Internet evidence has been used to solve some crimes , there have also been examples of mistakes in the process .
Last year , Manchester Technologies , a company in Hauppauge , N.Y. , sued Ronald Kuhlman Jr. and Kim Loviglio , claiming they had posted messages on a Web site that defamed its chief executive .
Manchester had identified Mr. Kuhlman and Ms. Loviglio based on information provided by Cablevision , their Internet provider , which incorrectly associated their account with the Internet Protocol address used to make the postings .
Manchester dropped its suit against Mr. Kuhlman and Ms. Loviglio , who in turn sued Cablevision .
That case was settled for undisclosed terms , their lawyer , Mark Murray , said .
The 1996 law that governs privacy for telephones , Internet use and faxes -- the Electronic Communications Privacy Act -- provides varying degrees of protection for online information .
It generally requires a court order for investigators to read e-mail , although the law is inconsistent on this , treating unopened items differently from those previously read .
The standard to compel an Internet service provider to provide identifying information about an Internet user is lower -- in general , an investigator needs a subpoena , which can be signed by a prosecutor , not a judge .
( And the USA Patriot Act allows some of these procedures to be waived when lives are at risk . )
By comparison , domestic first - class mail requires a search warrant to be opened .
In cases in which investigators want to intercept Internet communication as it occurs , they must get the same authorization needed for a telephone wiretap , which requires continuing court monitoring .
In 2004 , there were 49 cases of computer or fax transmissions being monitored under these procedures , according to federal statistics ( which exclude national security cases ) .
But the chance at a free master 's degree persuaded Brandon J. Archuleta , a West Point senior , to sign up for an extra three years in uniform .
" Education is extremely important to me , and I know I want a master 's degree at the very least , " Cadet Archuleta said .
" The Army has a wonderful relationship with some of the top - tier graduate schools , especially in the Ivy League .
I want to attend a school of that caliber . "
In 2001 , but before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , 9.3 percent of the Army 's young officers left active duty at their first opportunity .
By 2002 , the number of those junior officers leaving at their first opportunity dropped to 7.1 percent , and in 2003 , only 6.3 percent opted out .
But the number grew to 8.3 percent in 2004 and 8.6 percent in 2005 .
The statistics are even more striking among West Point graduates , who receive an Ivy League - quality education at taxpayer expense -- and , in the view of many senior officers and West Point alumni , owe the nation and the Army a debt of loyalty beyond the initial five years of active duty .
The retention rate at the five - year mark for the West Point class of 1999 was 71.9 percent in 2004 , down from 78.1 percent for the previous year 's class .
And for the class of 2000 , the retention rate fell to 65.8 percent , meaning that last year the Army lost more than a third -- 34 .
2 percent -- of that group of officers as they reached the end of their initial five - year commitment .
That is the highest rate of loss over the past 16 years among West Point officers reaching the five - year mark .
For young officers receiving their commissions in 2006 , the Army will guarantee slots in the most sought - after branches of the service -- aviation , armor or intelligence , for example -- in exchange for an extra three years in uniform .
Similarly , if a young officer wants an initial posting to a desired location or an opportunity to earn a master 's degree , the Army will guarantee either choice in exchange for three more years of active duty .

I am finally satisfied with the rear suspension geometry .
So i decided to post some pics here .
You 'll notice , the lack of the turntable differential .
What we have here is a heavily modified previous generation diferential , with 4 double bevel 12 tooth gear halves .
The normal thin 12 tooth gears just do n't hold , they break and the teeth get destroyed almost instantly .
We 'll see how this holds up .
The suspension is multilink , and has precisely the same setup as the original challenger rear suspension .
When the suspension gets compressed the rear toe arm causes the wheels to gain a slight toe in .

Stop Rolling Your Own CSV Parser !
September 12 , 2006
Would you write your own XML Parser ?
Only if you 're f***ing crazy .
Yet developers constantly write their own " little " csv parsers .
How does this madness occur ?
Step 1 -- Ignorance
" Oh this will be easy , I 'll just read the file one line at a time , calling String . Split ( ' , ' ) to break each line into an array .
" Then I 'll be able to refer to each item by number . "
( You 're already headed for stormy water ... anything you do from now on will only drive you into the rocks harder and faster ... )
continues ...
Step 2 -- First Doubts
" Oops .
I need to handle for commas , which are either escaped ( by prefixing them with a special symbol ) or contained inside quotes . "
( So you decide to use regular expressions .
After a bit of tinkering you 've got a nice little regular expression that seems to work . )
( That ringing in your ears is Jamie Zawinski saying " Some people , when confronted with a problem , think ' I know , I 'll use regular expressions . '
Now they have two problems . )
Step 3 -- Uh oh
" The quotes worked good at first ... but quotes need to be escaped too .
And sometimes there 's double quotes , sometimes single quotes .
Easy -- I 'll just fix my regular expression . "
Step 4 -- The Descent into Chaos
You start to adopt a ' test - driven ' approach , only it 's more of a ' panic driven ' approach .
You write numerous test cases for your unwieldy csv parser .
It behaves nice .
You test it on more real world examples ... it breaks your existing code and you need a new test case or two .
You begin to add new test cases , and trying always to do the simplest thing that will get the code to work .
It 's now eight weeks since you said " I know !
I 'll just use String .
Split ( ... " .
You have grown a long beard , which is particularly annoying as you are a woman .
You have lost all boundaries in regard to personal hygiene .
Managers circle your desk like vultures circling a wounded leopard .
Step 5 -- Enough !
You lift your head from the keyboard for just moment when a thought strike you .
The problems you are facing have been faced before .
You are re-inventing the wheel .
You download a code sample from the internet , and use your test cases to try them out .
The downloaded code is much worse than what you 've written yourself .
You download more samples from the internet .
They 're all broken .
In. Different .
Ways .
When you try to contact the developers of each library to see how they work , you find that the developers have generally retired and / or passed away and / or quit working in the IT industry .
You consider how fortunate they are .
Step 5 --
Help me !
You go to the blog of someone you know and trust .
You email that person .
That person writes back and says , in big letters :
Just Use Marcos Meli's File Helpers .
The great thing about File Helpers is not just that it works , but that it is actively developed by Marcos , and if you need an improvement to it , you can contact Marcos ( marcosdotnet at yahoo.com.ar ) .
He 's a real person who cares about getting his library to work properly .
He 's not just stopping at a ' good - enough ' solution .
The other , and perhaps even greater , advantage is one you never dreamed of .
Now you do n't have to refer to fields by number .
No more " myArray [ 4 ] " -- you can now say " myCustomer .
Id " .
The resulting code is so readable that you 'll survive your next code inspection without getting your arms and legs torn off by Terry ( Head Code Nazi and leader of the local chapter of The Programming Gestapo ) .
You can stop re-inventing the wheel and get on with your day job : cranking out more bugs , faster .
( But it 's a good thing this experience gave you a chance to try out test driven development ! )

Camille , the romantic comedy currently in filming in Canda stars the one time fashion “ icon ” Sienna Miller and the guy that she was rumoured to be dating , James Franco .
And Sienna , the formerly stylish maven , Giorgio Armani was on hand to create a secial series of costumes for her to wear , including an Armani wedding dress , throughout most of the film .
What is a little heartbreaking for Armani lovers is that the dress suffers increasing damage as the storyline of Sienna ’s character unfolds .
James is one stylish lad in the movie , dressed in a classic Armani tuxedo paired with a custom ruffled evening shirt .
George says my physics is " bafflingly bad " and contains " downright misrepresentation and pseudo - scientific gibberish " .
Yet he himself nonsensically refers to " lambda " as a " constant " in the Stefan - Boltzmann radiative - transfer equation .
Lambda is not a constant , and it's not a term in the equation .
He wrongly states that the equation only describes " black bodies " that absorb all radiant energy reaching them .
No qualified physicist would make such a schoolboy howler .
Of course the equation is n't limited to black bodies .
Its emissivity variable runs from zero for white bodies to 1 for black bodies .
The Earth / troposphere system is a rather badly - behaved grey body with emissivity about 0.6 .
He lifted these errors verbatim from a blog run by two authors of a now - discredited UN graph that tried to abolish the medieval warm period .
I 'd exposed the graph in my articles .
Check your sources , George .
He says I was wrong to reinstate the medieval warm period cited by the UN in 1990 but abolished by it in 2001 .
A growing body of scientific papers , some of which I cited , shows that the warm period was real , global and up to 3C warmer than now .
Check them out , George .
He says I should n't have said the Viking presence in the middle ages shows Greenland was warmer than now .
The Viking farmsteads in Greenland are now under permafrost , and you can't farm permafrost .
He says I was wrong to say James Hansen told Congress in 1988 that world temperature would rise 0.3C by 2000 .
Hansen projected 0.25 and 0.45C , averaging 0.35C .
Outturn was 0.05C .
I fairly said 0.3C and 0.1C .
He says my source was a work of fiction by Michael Crichton .
It was n't : it was Hansen 's graph .
He says I overlooked the difference between the immediate and delayed temperature response to changing conditions .
In fact I expressly addressed it , citing evidence on both sides of the theory that the delayed air - temperature response arises from warming of the oceans .
He says I said the warming effects of carbon dioxide had been " made up " .
I did n't .
I said all were agreed that there was more CO2 around and that we could expect some warming .
But there is no consensus on how much .
He says I claimed to know better than the UN 's scientists .
I 'm arrogant , George , but not that arrogant : I said the contrarians were probably a lot closer to the truth than the UN .
Too many facts wrong .
Too much argument ad hominem instead of ad rem .
Too much ignorance of the elementary physics of radiative transfer and equilibrium temperature .
Still , gie the puir numpty a cigar - at least he spelled my name right .

Free Blues Guitar Video Lessons -
I have put together a section with guitar video lessons and guitar riffs ideas on this site .
I 'm doing this out of my passion for guitar playing , hoping that the few things I know about guitar playing could be useful to someone out there .
The lessons are available as video clips in Flash , Windows Media ( WMV ) and Quicktime format .
You can download some of the guitar videos in Quicktime ( mov ) format so that you do n't have to watch them on my website every time ( unless you want to ! ) .
The older video clips are recorded with a SONY DCR TRV - 33 Digital Camcorder .
and for a while , I used a Canon Vixia HG - 20 .
From March 2011 , all my videos are recorded with a Panasonic HVX200 .
I am not providing everything in tab or notational format - I am more of a " play by ear " kind of guy .
There are not many tabs for the videos - but there are some , and I am working on more tabs .
My hope is that you will learn something from these guitar lessons and guitar licks or riffs .
If it seems very difficult to play one the examples , try spending more time listening - sometimes all you need is to really listen to the same thing over and over , as well as play it over and over , and the pieces will start to fall into place .
Here is a tool I recommend for slowing down music , so you can easier figure out what is being played .
It 's called Song Surgeon , and it 's got some nice features .
Check it out .
General Advice For Playing Guitar Better
Most important advice - listen over and over again to good players , including horn and piano players .
Variety of influences is a good thing .
Start transcribing music - use software to slow down the song if you have to ( Windows Media Player - SHIFT +CTRL+S ) and find the notes and the way the musical phrase is played in time .
SHIFT +CTRL+N for playing in normal speed with Windows Media Player .
Blues and Improvisation .
There are endless ways of playing the blues .
Probably the most important thing to consider is phrasing , or they way the notes are expressed over time .
For example , go listen to Albert King .
He was one of the best blues guitar players there ever was .
He plays really tasteful phrases , and even though you hear similar ideas more than once , they are still expressed in different ways .
This is the essence of great blues guitar .
Further to this , try to copy a simple lick from your favourite blues player .
Learn the notes , and learn the chord progression behind the lick .
The next step is to try and play this lick with different phrasing .
Try using the lick in a totally different song ; try make it sound like you !
You can try starting the lick at different time than in the original context - for example in the third bar instead of the first , and so on .
Another thing to practice is to play this lick in different keys .
You should at least be able to play your favourite licks in the keys of A , C , D , E , G , but why stop there - all twelve keys should be the goal .
Memorizing or internalizing is another important concept .
I try to learn phrases and licks and then make them into my own thing , and I play these things over and over until I do n't have to think about how to play them .
These phrases become part of your vocabulary on the guitar .
Play these newly learned ideas every day until you can play them without thinking .
HEY !
Have fun playing guitar !

メディアエクスチェンジ（MEX）は2月17日，ユーザーズ・ミーティングを開催（写真）。PtoP型ファイル共有ソフト「
Winny」開発者の金子勇氏が講演し，次世代ファイル共有システムを展望した。金子氏は2004年5月にWinnyの開発・配布が著作権法違反幇助に当たるとして逮捕され，現在係争中。
金子氏 は 「 次世代のファイル共有システムは 『BitTorrent』の効率性と『Freenet』の匿名性を兼ね備え，オープンソースのシステムとして現れるだろう」と予測した。
BitTorrentはファイル転送効率が極めて高いオープンソースのPtoP型ファイル共有システム。最近ではWebブラウザの「Opera」がBitTorrentに対応する機能を搭載したことで話題となった。一方，Freenetは匿名性を重視したオープンソースのPtoP型ファイル共有システムで，金子氏がWinnyを開発する際に大きな影響を受けたもの。金子氏によると，次世代のファイル共有システムは「私も基本的な設計は思い付く」という。
加えて，次世代のシステムはWinnyと異なり，オープンソースにすべきであると強調した。金子氏は「 Winnyのプログラム・ソースを公開すると，匿名性の点では問題ないが，効率性の面で問題が生じると思っていた。ダウンロードだけを行うフリー・ライド（ただ乗りのバージョン）が出てくると考えた」。その結果，Winnyをオープンソースにしなかった。
だが，金子氏 は 「 それは2002年や2003年といった当時の状況。その後，効率性を重視しながらオープンソースであるBitTorrentが出てきた」点を指摘。現在は効率性とオープンソースは両立するとしている。
また， 「（オープンソースでないと）開発者が攻撃の対象となる。これは私が身をもって示した」（金子氏）。開発者が攻撃対象にならないようなシステムであることも強調した。

Do you know Ben Domenech ?
He 's the Washington Posts ' new , um , well , I do n't know how I should describe him .
Blogger ?
Writer ?
Resident Propagandist ?
Take your pick .
Benny has been hired by the WaPo to write a brand spankin ' new blog called " Red America " .
Head on over to " Red America " and you see Ben giving you a smoldering " Domenech .
Ben Domenech " look in front of an outdated map of the United States ( by the way , the whole " red state / blue state " thing is so 2004 .
It 's all about the purple now , baby .
Get with the program . )
Now , it 's not just the airbrushing and soft glow added around Ben 's face that gives him that baby - faced look .
Ben is 24 years old .
24 years old and he has been given that rare opportunity any writer , ANY writer , would absolutely die for ... an opinion gig at the Washington Post .
Naturally , I was jealous .
Not about the baby - faced airbrushed looks ( I 've already got those ) but about the fact Ben got a gig and I did n't .
I mean , we 're basically the same age .
He writes at RedState , I write at Daily Kos .
He was a Bush political appointee , I could be , if " competence " was one of Bush 's hiring criteria .
He was a " chief speechwriter " for Senator John " You Don't Need Liberties If You 're Dead " Cornyn .
I 'm a chief speechwriter for , well , myself .
Anyway , you get the point .
Ben , I 'm going to put my jealousy aside for a second and give you some advice as you embark on this awesome feat of giving " Red America " the voice that it already had in every corner of the conservative establishment media .
Now , here are the top 3 things I 'd do if I were Ben Domenech :
1. Contact Google and Archive.org :
You do n't want people knowing that the Washington Post hired the founder of a racist blog .
I 'll give it some time before all the racism on your site RedState is scrubbed away , but Google cache and web archives can be a bitch , so you might want to take care of that asap .
( While you 're at it , scrub your comment that Coretta Scott King was a commie .
You would n't want people thinking you 're an asshole , now would you ? )
2. Ditch the Freeper terms : Ben , Ben , Ben .
You 'll never be taken seriously as a writer if you use words like " MSM " .
I 'd ditch the " mainstream media " term pronto , since it makes you look like a hypocrite .
You are , after all , sucking at the teat of the very " mainstream media " you claim to abhor .
And I know you 're positively itching to use the term " Islamofascist " , but I 'd keep away from that term , lest you want your WaPo career associated with these freaks .
3 . Hire yourself an editor : Yeah , I know , bloggers do n't need editors .
But Benny , you 're not just writing for Islam - hatin ' , corporation - lovin ' , Constitution - hatin ' conservatives anymore .
You have a wider audience now , one that wo n't swallow your made - up shit wholesale .
Like when you claim that " this blog represents the majority of Americans . "
First , I 'm not quite sure what your blog represents besides the underbelly of Freeperville but let 's accept your assumption it represents " Republicans . "
The Senate 's fifty - five Republicans represent 131 million people , while its forty - four Democrats represent 161 million .
So the majority of Americans are actually represented by Democrats , not Republicans .
An editor , for example , would have caught the gross error of claiming Republicans " advocate views shared by a majority of voters " ( last time I checked , over the years the majority of voters have been against overturning Roe , against cuts in funding for alternative energy , against privatizing Social Security , and against lax gun laws ) .
Now , if you do n't hire an editor to correct every other sentence in your posts , then I 'll have to expose your lies on a daily basis , and hon , I do n't have enough hours in my day to go down that route .
So , in conclusion , congratulations to the baby - faced Ben Domenech on landing my dream job .
Landing the gig with zero journalistic credibility , coupled with your history of a partisan hacktitude that rivals Ken Melhman 's is a miracle .
The next miracle to tackle : proving yourself to be anything other than a propagandist and a Ann Coulter - wannabe .
Good luck , Ben !

Enlarge Image
As I glided into the heart of the new seven tesla MRI scanner , I could n't help reflecting how far these machines had come in terms of user friendliness alone since the first one clanked into action on this same spot in 1977 .
Back then its inventor , Dr , now Sir , Peter Mansfield tested his rather Heath - Robinsonesque prototype on himself .
Laboriously squeezing into the cramped interior , he captured the world 's first magnetic resonance image of the human body - a slice through his own torso , showing off his liver and spinal column .
If there is a problem then it stands out very clearly
Sir Peter Mansfield
" The worst thing that could have happened would have been a cardiac arrest .
" I gave the order to press the button for a single pulse - there was a click and I felt nothing , so we carried on the scan . "
Invaluable resource
Thirty years on , such suspicions are long - forgotten .
MRIs are now a standard diagnostic tool for diseases such as cancer .
They are also invaluable to researchers studying the brain - prized for their ability to image and differentiate between the body 's soft tissues as well as bone .
" One is n't fishing around looking at poor quality images trying to work out what this bump is , " said Sir Peter .
" If there is a problem , then it stands out very clearly so medically there 's been a huge advance . "
Sir Peter won the Nobel Prize in 2003 for his work on MRI and is still working at Nottingham University .
One of his young post - doctorate assistants , Peter Morris , who was at the controls of that first scanner three decades ago , is also still there .
The seven tesla magnet - the biggest in the UK - is now Professor Peter Morris 's baby and he is very excited by its potential .
The 40 - tonne magnet was delivered in December 2004 and building it into a working scanner was no simple matter .
With a magnetic field 140,000 times that of the Earth's , it throws out a powerful force that has to be shielded in concrete and more than 200 tonnes of iron .
If not all the compasses for miles around would point at the MRI unit .
It has taken 18 months to get the new scanner installed and working effectively , but now Professor Morris and his team are ready to use it to probe the functions and failures of the body .
Test drive
To see just how advanced Nottingham 's new prize is , I volunteered for some medical trials on the new machine .
We can look down at a lower scale than we have been able to before
Professor Peter Morris
These MRI scanners are used in research and some hospitals .
I then spent about 40 minutes inside the new 7T scanner .
It promises the most detailed images yet of the brain , as well as intricate real - time imaging of thought processes that can be used to study mental illnesses such as schizophrenia .
Even to my untrained eye , I could see the stark contrast between the new and the old .
The seven tesla image was crisper , with far more detail .
" Essentially what we are seeing with the seven tesla is an amplified difference between the different tissues , and with much finer resolution , so we can see much finer detail , " said Professor Morris .
" We can look down at a lower scale than we have been able to before .
We know that there are some lesions which are located within particular structures which are currently too fine to see , and we hope we will be able to address those at seven tesla .
" We think there is a very real opportunity to study some of the neurodegenerative diseases and their effects on the brain . "
I was in the pair of scanners for about two hours and it is very noisy inside ; you have to wear earplugs and headphones .
It 's not for the claustrophobic , as you are deep inside a tube and have no room to move .
Nodded off
But you soon get used to it and I found it very relaxing , and I have to confess that at one point I fell asleep .
This was during a clinical trial when I was supposed to be focussing on some checkerboard images which were flashing before my eyes .
My only defence is - how often do you get to lie down - with no - one bothering you , during the middle of the day ?
Thankfully , I did manage to stay awake for a second experiment , so my contribution to brain imaging may yet make its way into one of the Nottingham team 's research papers .
Do n't expect to see the new machine being installed in a hospital near you .
This is one of only a handful of seven tesla magnets in the world .
And it 's surely appropriate that one of those is in Nottingham - the home of the MRI scanner .
An airplane announcement I ’ve been waiting for
I blogged a few months back about how ridiculous the rules are regarding the use of electronic equipment on airplanes .
I often leave my iPod on , and sometimes ( gasp ! ) my laptop , which I leave secretly running inside my briefcase .
I am happy to report no problems so far .
A flight attendant did something on my flight a few days ago that I have beeen waiting to hear for a long time .
After the initial announcement that everyone had to turn off their electronic devices , she let a few minutes pass .
Then she got back on the microphone and said , “ According to the reading on my equipment up front , there is still one cell phone turned on , so please check that you have turned yours off . ”
Obviously , she has no equipment for detecting this , but you should have seen the passengers scramble to check their bags .
Except for me , of course .
My laptop hummed happily along under the seat in front of me .
Still , brilliant on the part of the flight attendant , although I think it would have been more convincing coming from the pilot .
The Economist , meanwhile , picked up on a theme mentioned in my past blog post regarding the nonsense in the ritual airline safety message about “ in the unlikely event of a water landing … ”
Here is the Economist ’s version of the in flight announcement we really want to hear ( although you may need to be a subscriber to follow the link ) .
And , finally , let ’s hope you do n’t have to sit next to me on your next flight .
Not only do I put you at risk because I do n’t turn off my iPod and thus interfere with airline communications , but TSA just confiscated my deodorant and my toothpaste .
Of course they let me keep my contact lens solution .
Hmmm …if I were a terrorist , do n’t you think that I could figure out how to take the top off a bottle of contact lens solution and put my explosive liquids in there ?
It is totally pointless to enforce rules which impose costs on innocent people , but are easily circumvented by terrorists .
Can anyone think this is accomplishing anything productive ?
An enormous iceberg , C - 16 , rammed into the well - known Drygalski Ice Tongue , a large sheet of glacial ice and snow in the Central Ross Sea in Antarctica , on 30 March 2006 , breaking off the tongue ’s easternmost tip and forming a new iceberg .
This animation , comprised of images acquired by Envisat ’s Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ( ASAR ) , shows the iceberg and the ice tongue before and after the collision .
On 26 March , C - 16 was pinned at the southern edge of the ice tongue but had started migrating by 27 March .
The collision on 30 March shows the ice tongue breaking off , and the final image on 1 April captures C - 16 and the new iceberg swinging to the other side of the ice tongue .
Mark Drinkwater of ESA 's Ocean and Ice Unit said : “ During its passage to the coastal foot of the Drygalski Ice Tongue , C - 16 , which measures 18.5 kilometres by 55 kilometres , looped into and around McMurdo Sound before being carried quickly to the north .
" The surface ocean currents appear to have predominantly steered the iceberg , not the winds , thus telling us about important aspects of the adjustment in the ocean circulation since the departure of large grounded icebergs off Ross Island . "
The floating Drygalski Ice Tongue , which protrudes 80 kilometres into the ocean , is connected to the David Glacier .
If it were to break loose , scientists fear it could alter ocean currents and change the region ’s climate .
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
For the past year or so , this is what I 've been telling people in private .
Now that there appears to be some sputtering by both the stock and by those who defend Microsoft I think it might be high time to explain my position .
Let me preface by saying that Microsoft MSFT , - 0.84 % is not about to stop making gobs of money .
It 's just that there is virtually nothing interesting or exciting happening ( with the lone exception of the X - Box360 ) with anything the company is doing .
To make matters worse none of the upcoming upgrades to the operating system or Microsoft Office appear to have any ' must - have " qualities needed to boost sales in a meaningful way .
Compare what is going on at Microsoft to Apple AAPL , - 0.48 % .
And now Apple is piling on with new TV commercials ridiculing all the viruses and security issues you buy when you buy a Windows - based PC .
Microsoft advertising ironically highlights dinosaurs .
Let 's just look at a casual status report of Microsoft 's bed - ridden condition :
1. Vista OS .
It 's now so delayed that its consumer version will miss the 2006 Christmas season .
It 's now supposed to arrive in early 2007 .
Even when it does , all of its promised cool features have been removed and it appears to be little more than a gussied - up version of Windows XP .
It appears as if it is going to be a great disappointment .
This should have been the company 's number one priority .
2. Office 2007 .
There is nothing in this new suite that is going to do much more than sustain the product as a dominant office suite .
Unfortunately seven different versions are going to be released which will just confuse things .
A new enterprise version has been added which appears to have a Lotus Notes - like element called Microsoft Groove .
This is being sold as some sort of solution for online collaboration .
If it is anything like Notes it will create a lot of anguish with users .
3. MSN .
Microsoft should have abandoned MSN a decade ago .
There is a lot of talk about Microsoft becoming more of a publisher and selling advertising .
Microsoft should be buying advertising not selling it .
This is not a media publishing company ; it 's a software publishing company .
Why people keep encouraging Microsoft to go in this direction is baffling .
4. MSN Search Engine .
Again more of the same and pointless .
Selling ads
5. Xbox360 .
The potential to become the dominant game platform and an eventual and enviable profit center .
Unfortunately the company did not foresee the Sony delays and failed to manufacture enough units to satisfy the demand .
This was an exhibition of poor planning and bad business intelligence gathering .
6. Pad - based computing .
According to Gates just a few years back this was to become the dominant form of computing by now .
What happened ?
7. Dot Net initiative .
The .
Net framework that many believe is an example of how Microsoft can actually put together elegant and powerful architectures when it wants to , is being killed by Open Source systems that are free and almost just as powerful .
Microsoft has been unable to cope with Open Source except to complain about it .
8. Preoccupation with Google .
Microsoft is too easily distracted by successful companies who are not competitors .
There is a deep - rooted belief that if a company like Google is successful , then they are an enemy per se .
So the company obsesses on what Google is doing rather than concentrating on important Microsoft projects .
Now Microsoft is about to do a deal with Yahoo to flank Google .
This old - lady - like skittishness is unbecoming for a company this size .
This only scratches the surface of the Microsoft malaise .
Now if the investment community sees light at the end of this tunnel good for them .
I sure do n't see it .
I see a company that has settled in and has become big , profitable , and unexciting , lacking real focus or spirit .
James Bach 's seminal rant , No Best Practices , is a great reality check for architecture astronaut rhetoric .
It 's worth revisiting even if you 've read it before .
Some might say Bach 's viewpoint is pessimistic , even cynical :
The way to get rich in this world is mainly by making people feel large hope about a small exertion ( i.e. " six - second abs " , lottery tickets , voting in an election , maturity models , and stuff like that ) .
If you want to get rich , do not tie yourself to the truth .
I say his viewpoint is not only healthy , but necessary .
If it feels painful , that 's good .
The truth is always a little painful .
You should question all the advice you get .
And you should especially question any so - called " best practices " .
The very utterance of the words " best practice " should set off warning klaxons , sirens , and flashing red lights .
At that moment , you 've left the realm of opinion and advice .
You 've entered the realm of evangelism and true believers .
And yet the world is full of best practices and tidy little checklists .
Developers are all too eager to preach the one true solution ..
In way too many meetings , the fastest talkers win .
And by " fastest talkers " , I mean those who are the first to articulate an idea , challenge , issue , whatever .
Too many of us assume that if it sounds smart , it probably is , especially when we are n't given the chance to think about it .
.. but problems are rarely that simple in the real world .
Why ?
James
Bach has a theory :
Do you know what 's behind all this ?
I think it 's simply that so few of us know how to do our jobs .
Like puffer fish , many of us feel that we need to huff ourselves up so that predators wo n't devour us .
We fluff ourselves full of impressive words .
All this impressive talk is fueled by fear .
The field of software development is so vast -- and the piece of it we know is so impossibly tiny .
We 're constantly living in fear that people will find out how little we know .
That people will realize we 're impostors who are lucky to still have a job .
Rather than simply stating what we 've done and how we did it , we feel compelled to puff it up into a spiny , intimidating best practice .
We attach our egos to our code frameworks .
If someone does n't agree with our approach , they 're attacking us personally .
If someone has a different best practice , they 're amateurs who do n't understand the problem domain .
Fear can make you do some irrational things .
Being honest and humble is difficult -- it 's painful to admit that you do n't have the answer ; that you 're not an expert ; that there are so many variables you can't control .
But whatever you do , always avoid the empty trap of the puffer fish .

Jatha Overview
Contains a large subset of Common LISP .
Not a toy implementation .
Includes the org .
jatha.dynatype package that implements a hierarchy of dynamically - typed data types that follows the Common LISP set of data types .
package that implements a hierarchy of dynamically - typed data types that follows the Common LISP set of data types .
Has been used to convert Algernon , a medium - sized LISP rule engine , to Java on a line - for - line basis .
Surprisingly fast .
Useful as an embedded library , or as a stand - alone application .
Jatha history
In 2002 I started using Jatha to convert the Algernon rule engine from LISP to Java .
This resulted in several extensions to the library and verification that the library was complete enough to distribute .
The first open source version of Jatha was distributed on June 14 , 2003 .
Jatha development is now supported by Hewett Research .

No adventure game designer had ever achieved the level of success as Roberta Heuer Williams ( Roberta Williams ) had .
Born in 1953 , she and her husband Ken Williams co-founded On - Line Systems , which later became Sierra On - Line , when she was only 26 .
Mystery House , which she wrote in 1979 , was the first graphic adventure game ever created for the PC .
Her portfolio of games , spanning over nearly 20 years , had single - handedly heralded the arrival of the graphic adventure genre and the demise of interactive fiction .
Since her departure from Sierra On - Line in 1999 , she has retired to a busy life of travel with her husband .
Shy from being in the public eye nowadays , it is common knowledge that Williams has repeatedly turned down past requests for interviews .
It is under such circumstances that we feel extremely privileged to be granted this brief opportunity to interview the iconic game designer .
In this rare exclusive interview , Williams speaks of her game design philosophy , her career retrospect with Sierra On - Line , her view of the current state of adventure games , and what life holds for her in the future .
Check out our latest photos of Roberta and Ken Williams !
Your games , most notably Mystery House and King 's Quest , have laid down the framework by which graphic adventure games are now defined .
Many of today 's games , while not necessarily labeling themselves as adventure , blend in game elements such as quests , puzzles , and storytelling that are characteristic of the genre you have created .
What are the essential elements you consider that define an adventure game ?
What design framework , however arbitrary , do you follow when creating your games ?
You must keep in mind that I have not created a new game in about 8 years , therefore , anything that I say about adventure games has to be taken in that context .
I also have to say that I have not played any adventure games since then and really have no idea what today 's adventure games are like .
( Hard to believe , I 'm sure , given who I am , but , unfortunately , oh , so true . )
In my day , when creating a new adventure game , my first thoughts , before even thinking about any ' framework ' were :
What is the story ?
Who are the characters , especially the main character ?
What is he / she trying to do , i.e. what is the quest ?
In what sort of ' world or land ' is this game going to be played ?
In other words , I always thought first of the story , characters , and game world .
I needed to understand those before I could even think about any game framework , ' engine , ' or interface .
Once I had a good idea of the basic storyline , characters and world , I could think about how I wanted the game to play , to run , to appear .
Things like ' how many colors ' ( a real issue in the early days ) could I utilize , how much and what kind of animation , first - person perspective vs. third - person perspective , how to accomplish communication with the game and / or game characters , how much , if any , ' physical ' puzzles vs. ' thinking ' puzzles , what sorts of animation / game play would be required for more ' physical ' puzzles , how ' big ' the game could be ( in disk / CD size ) which translated to how many ' lands ' within the game world or how many places or ' rooms ' within those lands and the amount of characters and animation , music or sound effect issues , etc .
Obviously , before deciding on any of these , I had to know the parameters of the particular machines on which the game would be expected to run .
But , I would always take those particular parameters and ' push ' them even more , which was easy for me as I did n't have to do the programming ?
( You would n't believe how many programmers would say to my husband , Ken , " she wants the game to do what ?!!!! "
Oftentimes , Ken had to run interference between me and the programmers .
All of the artists , though , and the musicians and sound effects people loved me because I was able to get the programmers to program up some amazing tools that creative people could utilize and have fun with . )
Once I had figured out the ' framework ' ( now thought of in terms of the ' game engine ' ) that I wanted for the game , the programmers came into the picture .
Normally , they would essentially build the game engine around the type of game that I wanted it to be .
They would do their best to fulfill my vision of the game .
So , in those days , the game engine was built around my ideas , not the other way around , as , it seems in today 's world , so many games are .
If I were to ever create another game , I would do the same thing .
I would never take an existing engine and try to make it fit my ideas .
I would always think of how I would want the game to appear and to run and to accomplish the game play that I wanted , and then I would have the engine created .
Expensive , yes , but , I think worth it for the freshness that the game would have .
And , freshness is important .
If a game is fresh , new , intriguing , challenging , and enchanting , it will sell , and sell well .
You became the first woman to achieve critical success as a game designer , developer , and publisher in an industry that , at the time , was dominated by men .
What unjust criticisms or resentments had you or your games received during the earlier years of your career ?
It was because of you that other female game designers , such as Jane Jensen and Lori Ann Cole , could successfully break into the game industry .
What changes over time did you witness in the attitude toward women by the game industry during your career at Sierra On - Line ?
I really think that the idea that women are somehow ' punished ' or ' resented ' in the computer industry is overblown .
I never experienced any resentments or maltreatment by anybody in the computer industry about my gender .
Never .
In fact , it was the opposite ; I always felt that the ' men ' in the computer industry were happy to have me around .
I never felt that it was a gender thing .
I think that , perhaps , why you do n't see a lot of women in the computer game industry ( I do n't know ; maybe it 's different today and there a lot of them ) is because , at least in the old days , computer games and computers just were n't the focus of the average woman or girl .
In other words , the women / girls themselves just were n't that interested .
Now , you could say that that was because the games were n't designed with females in mind ( which was probably true because the ' boys ' were designing them ... for themselves ! ) , but , computers just were n't something that , at least in those days , the average woman was interested in .
Even a lot of men in those days were n't all that interested in computers !
Nowadays things are different ; computers have become more friendly , understandable , and lots of years and thought have been put into developing software to convince all sorts of people that they want and need a computer in their daily lives .
But , in those days , none of that was true .
But , back to the ' female ' thing :
No , I never experienced any problem with being a female in a so - called male - dominated field .
They were happy to have me .
It was just really up to me to actually ' put ' myself there .
If more women want to be a part of the computer industry today , they just have to do more to put themselves there .
Nobody , in reality , is keeping them out ... in my opinion , anyway .
Unquestionably , your most celebrated and seminal work has been King 's Quest .
The series has broken many new grounds in both game play and storytelling .
What elements ( such as plot development , character interaction , and puzzle play ) of King 's Quest are you most proud of ?
If there is to be a King 's Quest IX , what may the game have been about ?
As a young girl , I always had enjoyed the old fairy tales of yore .
I read them and re-read them .
Therefore , when thinking about designing a game , I naturally gravitated to what I liked and felt comfortable with .
I felt comfortable with the idea of fairy tales , and so , put that passion into my game of King 's Quest .
The first King 's Quest was really a compendium of many of the most common fairy tales , and , really was nothing but a big fairy tale that someone could directly experience in a very interactive way instead of in the old passive way of books , movies , or oral tales .
I introduced Sir Graham as the main character or ' hero , ' and then , when going on to develop King 's Quest II , I decided to develop him and his future family as the main characters for this series set in Daventry .
Even though Daventry , itself , was n't always where the game play took place , it was always there as the ' home ' of King Graham and his family .
It was the hearth and heart of the King 's Quest game world .
I am most proud of the development of the characters as personalities that game players could relate to and care about ; the beauty of the game world as each new King 's Quest was developed , and , in thinking of ways to introduce new game players to adventure gaming by developing the idea of the ' icon ' based interface rather than the old ' parser ' type of game communication where you had to think about how to type in sentences to the computer and then hope that , somehow , the game would respond to you .
Basically , in a nutshell , a lot of thought was put into making the King 's Quest world as beautiful as possible , as easy to navigate and communicate with as possible , and as engaging and entertaining as possible .
Trying to come up with mind - bending puzzles and brain - twisting plots was never something that I strived for , although , I believe that many designers of games and / or adventure games make their games more complex than they need to be .
As to a King 's Quest IX : Since I will never design a King 's Quest 9 , it would be unfair of me to comment on any one else 's endeavors in that area .
However , if there were ever to be a King 's Quest 9 , I wish it luck and hope that it could revive interest in adventure gaming as a whole and in the original King 's Quest games in general .
Many of your games have fueled heated controversies in the media and among game fans , rightly or wrongly .
Examples include the introduction of Rosella in King 's Quest IV : The Perils of Rosella , the suggestive rape scene of Adrienne in Phantasmagoria , and the transition from 2D to 3D in King 's Quest : Mask of Eternity .
Which of your games do you feel has been most misunderstood ?
Why ?
I guess that I 'm not understanding as to why you would consider the introduction of Rosella in King 's Quest IV as a controversy .
To me , it seemed a natural , and , in fact , King 's Quest IV was a much bigger hit than I , II , or III .
I do feel that King 's Quest IV was a pivotal game in bringing in more female players .
However , in no way did King 's Quest IV turn off male players .
Not at all .
As to the ' rape ' scene in Phantasmagoria : I do remember and understand the controversy .
I think the controversy was from two areas : the fact that I was the writer and designer of that game and was known for family - friendly games and that the subject matter of Phantasmagoria was fairly graphic in many respects .
As a creative person , it 's always fun and interesting to branch out into other areas of creativity .
Even though I dearly loved King 's Quest and the other games that I had worked on , I felt like I wanted to do something a bit different , plus , I happen to find the horror genre interesting and wanted to experiment with it as an adventure game .
I had always been intrigued by the emotional aspect of adventure gaming – the fact that people get so personally involved – and so , I wanted to see if that emotionality could be translated to horror as well .
In fact , in order for horror to succeed the player needs to be passionate and committed .
( That 's true for books and movies as well . )
The build - up of suspense is all emotion .
Being ' scared ' is gut wrenching .
Even though it 's always been important to me that players would be personally committed to all of my games , it was even more important for them to become very emotionally involved with Phantasmagoria in order to create the suspense and terror necessary for a successful horror story .
I relished the idea of trying .
So , in creating Phantasmagoria , I needed a character ( Adrienne ) who would be very empathetic to most people ; most women would relate to her , and most men would want to protect her .
However , she also had to become strong and to survive horrific circumstances .
It 's not easy , in fact , I would say downright impossible , to portray horrendous circumstances without terrible things happening .
If I had tried to candy - coat the story or ' back off ' a little , the story of Phantasmagoria would n't have worked and it would have been a terrible flop .
As it was , it was the most successful game that we had developed up to that point ( 1994 ) .
It sold more than a million copies in less than a year , which , in those days , was phenomenal .
I 'm sure that nowadays , a game that ' only ' sold a million copies in a year would be considered a monumental failure , but , in those days , a ' million - seller ' was something that we all strived for ; especially noteworthy when it 's remembered that Phantasmagoria only ran on computers and not on any game machines .
So , in answer to your question about the controversy of the ' rape scene ' :
In my opinion , in order to make the story believable and to emotionally bring the player into the action , it was a necessary scene .
When discussing the transition from 2D to 3D for King 's Quest VIII : Mask of Eternity , I can only say that we were on to the right idea of switching to 3D .
However , the implementation was not exactly correct .
In 20/20 hindsight , I would have omitted the RPG ( role - playing ) aspects and would have stuck with more traditional adventure game elements .
I would have thought more in terms of physical puzzles that could be done better in 3D than in 2D , but , still , I would n't have changed the game so dramatically just because I was switching from 2D to 3D .
But , what do they say about 20 /20 hindsight ?
If you are to pick only a single ( I know it is hard ) game that best represents your achievement and your career as a game designer , which game is it ?
Why ?
If I could only pick one game , I would pick Phantasmagoria , as I enjoyed working on it immensely and it was so very challenging ( and I love to be challenged ! ) .
However , in my heart , I will always love the King 's Quest series and , especially , King 's Quest , I since it was the game that really ' made ' Sierra On - Line .
This is a cliché question , but in truth you are among the few game designers in existence who are truly qualified to answer it .
Which of the following best describes the current state of the adventure genre — dead , dying , in hibernation , or in resurgence ( you can only pick one ) ?
What does it take for the genre to enjoy the popularity as it has once done in its yesteryears ?
Actually , I 'm not sure that I AM qualified to answer this question as I have not played or looked at any adventure games ( or , really , any games ) in almost 8 years ... unbelievable as that may seem .
So , keeping that in mind , you have to understand that my answer could be WAY off base !
However , I have to say that my definition of an adventure game is really an interactive story set with puzzles and obstacles to solve and worlds to explore .
I believe that the ' true ' adventure game genre will never die any more than any type of storytelling would ever die .
Sometimes , I think that something ' new ' may come along for awhile and take away attention from longer , story - oriented genres , like movies took attention away from books for awhile , and TV took attention away from movies for awhile .
Things like that .
One thing that I always like to say is that , for awhile , it looked like book reading was dead ( especially for young people ) , but Harry Potter proved that one wrong !
And then there 's the Da Vinci Code .
I remember in the 60s and the 70s , TV watching was really big and movie going was less important than it had been in decades prior .
But , in the 80s and 90s , movie going bounced back big time and TV sank a bit .
These things go in phases , but a good story never dies .
An adventure game is really nothing more than a good story set with engaging puzzles that fit seamlessly in with the story and the characters , and looks and sounds beautiful .
I do not think there is a need to try and make it ' multi- player ' or any of those things .
It just takes a good adventure game designer ( someone who knows and understands how to write a game play ' script ' in an interactive way ) , with a game company that will ' go out on a ledge ' and support that designer and give them the desired tools to create such a game , and I think that , as in the ' olden ' days of the 80s and 90s , adventure games would be as popular as ever , if not more so .
I think that Ken is right when he says that there is too much of the same thing and not much creativity put into today 's computer games because the game publishers and marketers are too afraid to go there , and so , are actually restricting creativity .
There is no doubt in my mind that given the right designer with the proper amount of budget and support from a top game publisher , an adventure game of the highest standards would set the computer game world on fire .
One day , it will happen .
Given the rarity which you speak to the public nowadays , what do you want to say to your countless number of fans and supporters as well as your past employees , colleagues , and collaborators ?
Lastly , what holds in the future for Roberta Williams ?
I want to say to everyone who has ever played one of my games , who has supported Sierra On - Line in the past and still holds it in their hearts and memories , ' thank you , thank you , thank you ! '
The experience of creating my adventure games was , other than marrying my husband and bringing into the world my two sons , the most fulfilling , wonderful experience I could ever had .
And , it could n't have been done without all of you !!
And , I want everyone to know that , even though I do n't come out of my ' shell ' much , I am still here and I am very , very appreciative of all of the support from everyone in the adventure gaming world .
It could n't have been done without all of you !!!
And , for the future Roberta Williams : Probably , designing a computer adventure game is in the past ; I 'm more into ' personal adventuring ' nowadays .
I 'm thinking in terms of writing a book , but , not on computer games or anything like that .
I 'm looking at writing an historical novel set in Ireland and the United States of 150 years ago ( has to do with my ancestors , kind of like an Irish ' Roots ' ) .
That is my passion right now .
We 'll see where that goes ...
We are most grateful for this opportunity to interview you , Roberta .
We look forward to hearing more about you and your future endeavors .

Presenter , Trust me I 'm an economist , BBC Two
What do love , war and poker have in common ?
High stakes , perhaps .
Certainly , in all three you spend a lot of effort trying to work out what the other side is really thinking .
There is another similarity : economists think they understand all three of them , using a method called " game theory " .
Threats and counter - threats
Game theory has been used by world champion poker players and by military strategists during the cold war .
Economics beats charm in the world of poker
Real enthusiasts think it can be used to understand dating , too .
The theory was developed during the second world war by John von Neumann , a mathematician , and Oskar Morgenstern , an economist .
Mr von Neumann was renowned as the smartest man on the planet - no small feat , given that he shared a campus with Albert Einstein - and he believed that the theory could be used to understand cold war problems such as deterrence .
His followers tried to understand how a nuclear war would work without having to fight one , and what sort of threats and counter - threats would prevent the US and the Soviets bombing us all into oblivion .
Since the cold war ended without a nuclear exchange , they can claim some success .
Understand the world
Another success for game theory came in 2000 , when a keen game theorist called Chris " Jesus " Ferguson combined modern computing power with Mr von Neumann 's ideas on how to play poker .
Mr Ferguson worked out strategies for every occasion on the table .
He beat the best players in the world and walked away with the title of world champion , and has since become one of the most successful players in the game 's history .
Game theory is a versatile tool .
It can be used to analyse any situation where more than one person is involved , and where each side 's actions influence and are influenced by the other side 's actions .
Politics , finding a job , negotiating rent or deciding to go on strike are all situations that economists try to understand using game theory .
So , too , are corporate takeovers , auctions and pricing strategies on the high street .
Financial commitment
But of all human interactions , what could be more important than love ?
The economist using game theory cannot pretend to hand out advice on snappy dressing or how to satisfy your lover in the bedroom , but he can fill some important gaps in many people 's love lives : how to signal confidence on a date , or how to persuade someone that you are serious about them , and just as importantly , how to work out whether someone is serious about you .
Engagement rings are designed as signs of strong commitment
The custom of giving engagement rings , for instance , arose in the US in the 1930s when men were having trouble proving they could be trusted .
It was not uncommon even then for couples to sleep together after they became engaged but before marriage , but that was a big risk for the woman .
If her fiance broke off the engagement she could be left without prospects of another marriage .
For a long time , the courts used to allow women to sue for " breach of promise " and that gave them some security , but when the courts stopped doing so both men and women had a problem .
They did not want to wait until they got married , but unless the man could reassure his future wife then sleeping together was a no - no .
The solution was the engagement ring , which the girl kept if the engagement was broken off .
An expensive engagement ring was a strong incentive for the man to stick around - and financial compensation if he did not .
Not committed
Modern lovers might think the idea of engagement ring as guarantee is a thing of the past , but they can still use game theory to size up their partners .
When a couple with separate homes move in together , selling the second home is an important signal of commitment .
That second home is an escape route - valuable only if the relationship is shaky .
If your partner wants to hang on to his bachelor pad , do not let him tell you it is merely a financial investment .
Game theory tells you that he is up to something .

These clocks bring binary numbers to everyday life , and after using them for some time you 'll learn to read binary numbers fluently .
Clocks that display time in binary commonly use LEDs to display the current time as binary numbers .
Here 's a different way to easily construct a binary clock , based on a cheap analog clock .
At the end of the conversion , you 'll have a clock that shows the time in both analog and binary .
The clock - mod involves printing , cutting and glueing , no electronics skills are required .
Patterns that allow you to create your own analog binary clock are provided at the end , in PDF format .

An analog clock that also shows the time in binary
Here 's an analog wall clock that also displays the time in binary .
Both hands are modified into circular , punched disks that rotate and display a binary number each , one for the current hour and one for minutes .
The hands are cut out templates that carefully align with a backdrop to show binary numbers in the clock 's hour and minute hands .
As such , the clock displays the current time in both analog and binary .
Because the mechanisms of this clock do not require any electronics , but purely the mechanical rotations of the hands , it is a true " analog binary clock . "
My mounted analog binary wall clock displays 11:40 .
The clock has been running for some time now , and is still on - time .
In the above image , you can see my implementation of the clock .
The photo was taken at 11:40 .
Reading the binary numbers from the inside out , the small hand shows the binary number 1011 for 11 , where the large hand is at 101000 for 40 .
The bit of the number that is displayed at the outer edge , is the least significant bit .
If the bit is white , it is on and denotes 1 .
The bit is 0 otherwise .
The next ( moving to the center ) bits represent 2/0 , 4/0 , 8/0 , 16/0 , 32/0 if these are on / off .
Adding these powers of 2 gives you the number represented by the binary number .
The list below shows all binary numbers from 0 to 59 .
Their last bits are the least significant .
The binary format for numbers 0 to 59 .
With six bits , we could 've gone up to 63 .
For higher numbers , we need more bits .
Since the clock shows the time in analog as well as binary , the analog format provides you with an estimate of the current time .
Based on that , it is easy to figure out the exact time ( in minutes ) from the binary numbers , and the analog estimate serves as a check for the math .
You 'll learn to read binary numbers in no time ( sic ) .
My other implementation of an analog binary clock , based on an IKEA Susa clock .
Photo was taken at 3:41 .
See if you can read the time on the clock below .
A simulation of the analog binary clock , in Flash .
The simulation shows your computer 's current time in both an analog and binary format .
The hands move slowly , in real time .
If you look at the simulation for about a minute , you 'll see how the clock goes from one minute to the next .
As the hand moves from one number to the next , at least one bit changes ( the least significant bit always changes color ) .
If the window is in between two numbers , you can see an edge between the changing bits .
When the hand is halfway through this change , it denotes the step to the next minute or hour .
Instructions
OK , let 's build one .
You 'll need the following : A hackable analog clock , printer , PDF patterns ( see below ) , thick ( grey ) paper , transparent plastic sheet , glue , scissors , hobby knife .
This clock can easily be constructed by hacking a cheap retail analog clock .
I found a pretty big one ( 27.5 cm diameter for the backdrop ) for 12 euros , and it was perfectly hackable as it could easily be taken apart and put back together .
I 'm sure good clocks can be found for half of that , or as second hand .
For the conversion , the clock 's backdrop is changed , and its hands are modified so they can be replaced by the rotating disks .
A hackable clock allows you to access the hands , and take them out so you can glue a new background image on the clock 's face , and modify the hands themselves .
Scissors can easily shorten flat metallic or plastic hands .
Flatter hands are better .
Make sure that you can print patterns large enough to cover the clock face .
Since I have access to print on A3 format , I can create clocks with a 30 cm diameter .
If you 're limited to using A4 format , your maximum diameter is about 21 cm .
The background image displays all required patterns of binary numbers .
The inner 4 bands represent the binary numbers from 0 ( all black , on top ) to 11 ( 1011 ) , for the hours .
The outer 6 bands represent the binary numbers from 0 to 59 ( 111011 ) for the minutes .
Note that the hour hand cannot display 12 .
With binary numbers in mind , it 's just more logical to start counting from 0 , instead of 1 .
At the bottom of this page you can find a PDF version of this pattern .
The dial for the clock .
The patterns show binary numbers for hours and minutes .
The hands require more crafting time .
I 've cut out thick paper based on the patters below .
The blue lines represent cutouts for the outer hand .
The red lines are cutouts for the smaller , inner hand .
The outer hand is glued onto transparent plastic .
Both templates are then connected to the original clock 's hands that have been shortened so they do n't show .
PDF patterns for the minute and hour hand are provided below .
Pattern for the templates to serve as the clock 's hands .
Patterns , PDF files
Below are the PDFs that I have generated ( with code that generates xfig files ) for my clock .
The patterns are based on a clock that is 27.5 cm in diameter .
An inner circle with a 6 cm diameter serves as a margin and to connect the clock 's hands to the new dials .
There 's a 1 cm margin on the outer edge of the dial .
These PDFs were printed on a 1:1 scale on A3 paper .
If your clock 's diameter is xxcm , print the files on a xx:27.5 scale .
The overall method can be simplified in various ways .
One way is to just change the dial of the clock , and leave the hands as they are .
Hands shaped as windows instead of full discs can also be used to emphasize the current time in binary .
The conversion of watches also seems plausible .
Order an analog binary clock online
Below is my design for an analog wall clock that allows you to read and learn about binary time , without having to go through all of the hacking .
You can order this clock online at Cafepress .
This clock allows you to read the current hour and minute in binary format
The inner bands of this clock represent 12 hours in binary format .
The outer bands represent 60 minutes in binary .
This clock is a good start if you 're planning on building your own binary clock as described above .

Slashdot Lessons
1 . No matter how much I or any other reporter or editor may know about a subject , some of the readers know more .
What 's more , if you give those readers an easy way to contribute their knowledge to a story , they will .
2 . Not all readers know what they 're talking about .
3 . No matter what you do , some readers will post malicious and / or obscene comments
4 . What if readers post comments that advertisers do n't like ?
The Business Side of a Newspaper Web Site
before
Print - them - yourself coupons .
This is lots cheaper than putting coupons in a print newspaper .
Many newspapers boast that today 's paper contains $ ___ worth of coupon savings .
Why do n't more papers make this boast about their online editions ?
TV stations could do this on their sites , too .
This would be an entirely new source of revenue for them , since there is no way to put a coupon in a TV spot .
Online ad circulars , similar to the paper ones that pack print newspapers on Sundays and holidays .
The print ones are expensive to produce and deliver , especially in color .
Online circulars would be far less costly .
Selling sponsorships for community calendars and other " public interest " sections that should be on every newspaper 's Web site -- but often are n't or are produced in too scattered a manner to be useful for readers .
C'mon , newspaper ( and local TV ) people !
A well - organized , database - driven events calendar is easy to produce .
If you do n't have one ( and sponsors for it ) , you should .
Sponsored , " free to individuals and small businesses , " local classifieds .
craigslist and eBay are busily taking the classified ad market away from newspapers , with Google getting ready to help them with this effort .
The Poynter Institute 's Steve Outing suggests that the best way to beat back this threat is to " Turn newspaper classifieds into an active and interactive community , instead of just static , dull listings .
A cold - hearted newspaper classifieds database could well be smothered by Google classifieds .
A local - focused interactive community may be less vulnerable . "

Newspapers Will Not Die
increase
I 'm going to use the Bradenton Herald as an example , not because it's a bad newspaper but because I live in the middle of its circulation area .
The Herald is a typical Knight Ridder small - city newspaper in every way except one : it serves Manatee County , an area with a fast - growing population where most new residents are old enough that they grew up reading newspapers every day .
Despite these favorable factors , the Herald 's circulation has declined by 3.5 % in the last year .
Of course , newspaper circulation declines are now normal rather than exceptional .
Other newspapers have done far worse , with the San Francisco Chronicle recording a 16.4 % drop in the last six months alone .
Much of the Chron 's circulation decrease was because it stopped giving away free papers .
The Boston Globe also stopped a giveaway program and suffered a circulation decline as a result , although only about half as big a loss as the Chron's , but the Globe 's marketing people have said that only half of the loss came from stopping the giveaways , and blamed the rest of it on the usual suspects , notably TV and the Internet .
These figures only measurenewspaper circulation .
They do n't include Web readership , which generally seems to be trending ( slowly ) upwards on newspaper Web sites .
Circulation figures can also be misleading because they only measure the total number of newspapers distributed , not the kind of people who read them .
And readership quality can often be more important , in a business sense , than quantity .
This is especially true for those newspapers ( namely , just about all of them ) that rely on advertising for the bulk of their income .
By definition , anyone who reads a newspaper online at home can afford a computer and an Internet connection , which means they are n't at the very bottom of the economic pile .
Online readers are also likely to be more open to new experiences , products , and services than those who do n't feel they need to use the Internet -- which by some estimates may be as many as half of all households within the Herald 's circulation area , which has a higher percentage of retirees than all but a few other U.S. counties .
Journalism professor Douglas Fisher and media executive Alan Mutter have both talked about intentional circulation losses on their blogs .
In his post , Fisher says , " The industry evolves to the point of small , expensive print publications and most of the ' mass ' news on the Web somehow .
Then , as we evolve toward paid content online will come issues such as whether a certain amount of ' base ' information should be free for every person -- sort of like a public utility of information ( perhaps presented as a social utility necessary in a functioning democratic society ) .
" Meanwhile , when newspapers talk about readership vs. circulation , they 're typically trying to estimate how many people read each copy of their print product ( pdf download ) rather than come up with a total picture of their publication 's readership , including its online presence .
This is a mistake .
Instead of treating their Web sites like unwelcome stepchildren , newspapers should turn them into theirmethod of news delivery -- and teach their reporters , editors , and ad sales people how to work effectively with this new -- to them -- medium .
Imagine a newspaper with a space for comments below each story on its Web site .
This Slashdot story has comments directly attached to it , not tucked away from public view the way the Bradenton Herald 's site hides reader comments on Bulletin Boards that are n't directly connected to any of the paper 's articles or editorials .
To make matters worse , the Herald 's Bulletin Boards require a separate login to post .
Even if you 're a logged - in reader you must put in your username and password again to use them .
As a result of these posting barriers , you hardly see any reader comments on the Herald 's site , and what few there are seem to come from a small group that posts over and over .
Even the Herald 's single ( hard to find ) blog , maintained by token hip - dude entertainment reporter Wade Tatangelo , draws so few daily comments that you could count them on the fingers of one hand -- and usually have four or five fingers left over .
By contrast , the Washington Post 's Web site has two blogs , Achenblog and The Debate , prominently displayed on the Opinions page that almost always draw 100 + comments per post .
A truly Web - hip newspaper would not only allow but encourage reader comments on all of its stories , not just on a blog or two .
With thousands of readers as fact - checkers , mistakes would rarely go uncorrected for long , and if there was any perceived bias in a controversial article , reader comments would make sure the other side got heard .
Even better , a reader who witnessed an event the paper covered would be able to add his or her account of it to the reporter 's , which would give other readers a richer and deeper view of it .
While some readers know more about any given topic than a professional journalist writing about it , most do n't .
Some , indeed , post anything about anything , including misleading or false information .
This is why Slashdot has a moderation system , and why all newspaper Web sites need to have moderation systems in place before they allow reader posts attached directly to stories .
Slashdot's , which is built into the code that runs the whole site , is probably too complicated for most newspapers , but everyone ( including newspaper publishers ) is free to download , use , and modify it .
For those who do n't want to use the code behind Slashdot , there are many other free ( and proprietary ) content management programs available that have similar -- and often simpler and less geeky -- moderation features built into them .
Slashdot removes posts only in response to Cease and Desist orders or legitimate copyright infringement complaints .
We find that malicious or obscene posts are usually moderated into oblivion almost immediately , because our readers -- hundreds of whom have moderation power at any given moment -- have a sharp eye for stupid stuff .
A mainstream newspaper might choose to remove blatantly disgusting posts , which would take some staff time .
There would also -- inevitably -- be second - guessing and complaints , including whines from readers who believed their posts were removed because they did n't follow the [ fill in political party here ] line , not because they used offensive language .
Moderation never makes everyone happy .
Someone will always feel the rules are too loose , while someone else will believe they 're too tight .
And moderates -- I mean moderators -- will always get flak from ____-wingers who think they 're biased .
But these problems should n't stop grown - up newspaper people from soliciting and publishing readers ' posts .
They should already be accustomed to bias accusations .
This is a problem , and one to which some newspapers are extremely sensitive -- not just over readers ' comments but sometimes over their own reporters ' stories .
A 1999 Washington Monthly article had some examples of how newspapers sometimes cater to advertisers instead of their readers .
Allowing readers to comment on stories , and allowing them to post anything they want ( other than obscenities , blatant hate speech , and personal attacks ) increases readers ' faith in the newspaper , which makes it a more effective advertising medium in the long run because some of that trust will rub off on advertisers that support it .
Slashdot , like almost all other Web , broadcast , and print media outlets , depends on ad revenue for most of its income .
For the first few years of its existence as a commercial entity , major advertisers were afraid to buy ads on Slashdot or other free - wheeling , community - driven sites .
They worried that every time they touted a product , all the customers they 'd ever irritated would post bad things about them .
It 's impossible to run a company of any scale without having at least a few dissatisfied customers , no matter how good your products and services are , so this was not an unjustified fear .
Luckily for Slashdot ( and our parent company ) , many companies have learned that they are going to get criticized online whether they like it or not , so at the very worst , running ads on pages where they get slammed gives them a chance to tell their side of the story .
Keyword - based ad placement helps them do this .
Imagine making software that 's often knocked for its security vulnerabilities , while competing software is available that costs little or nothing and does n't share your product 's problems .
You 'd want to run a Get the FUD ( Fear , Uncertainty , and Doubt ) campaign on every
Web page where the competing product was being discussed so that you could tell people who are ( obviously ) interested in the competing product how awful it is , and why they should buy yours instead .
On a local newspaper Web site , a developer intent on replacing pristine wilderness along a scenic river with ugly condominium towers in the face of opposition from local citizens ' groups could run a keyword - targeted campaign explaining why their buildings would be better than a swampy , mosquito - ridden riverfront .
They could stress the fact that they would reduce the population of turtles , spiders , alligators , shore birds , frogs , and other annoying wildlife , and that runoff from their chemically - fertilized landscaping would help keep local fish populations down by contributing to red tide , thereby reducing the number of smelly fishermen infesting the area .
Other , more sensible , businesses would use the same tactic -- keyword ad placement -- to sponsor discussions in a positive way .
An obvious example here in Florida would be resort property owners linking ads to tourism - related stories and the discussions attached to them .
With geotargeting becoming common on the Web , ads aimed at visitors could be visible to all of a Florida newspaper 's online readers , while ads for a local business would only be shown to local residents -- unless the local advertiser was canny enough to realize that Florida has many thousands of seasonal residents , and that reaching these snowbirds through the local newspaper 's
Web sitethey come South is a great way to get a leg up on competitors .
Some other ways to exploit the Web that newspapers do n't seem to do well : I believe the future of not only classified ads but of local news gathering and distribution is the " local - focused interactive community . "
According to this article , craigslist founder Craig Newmark agrees with me .
So do plenty of other Web entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who are busily building and financing " community " sites .
Local newspapers should have dominated all of this interactivity from the beginning .
They had the name recognition and -- through their print editions -- the promotional muscle to make their Web sites into unassailable community hubs .
But they did n't , and now they 're reduced to playing catch - up .
If the Sarasota Herald - Tribune had followed through on its plans to incorporate reader - written blogs into its site , Suncoastblog.com probably would n't exist .
This group blog is an admittedly lame effort , barely begun , put together by several people in this area ( including me ) who thought it would be nice to have a local site that might eventually cover events and places that do n't make their way into the local papers .
We know the Herald - Tribune , whose circulation area overlaps the Bradenton Herald's , had thought about hosting reader blogs at one point , because they asked readers to submit blog ideas several months ago .
I submitted one and never heard back .
I also submitted a local computer business column concept to the Herald .
I came up with it because the Herald has a Sunday business page it calls " Digital Manatee , " on which I haveseen anything other than out - of - town wire service material even though there is more than enough local computer and Internet business activity to fill a weekly column , and enough local computer and computer service vendors to surround that column with profitable advertising .
The Herald 's editor did n't respond to my proposal .
I 've written three computer - oriented books , and thousands of articles that have run online and in print all over the world , but I am apparently not worth even a polite turndown from my local paper 's editor .
No problem .
A week later I was having lunch with a couple of local entrepreneur buddies .
I told them what had happened .
They suggested an online computer business magazine instead of a Herald column , and offered to finance it on the spot , out of their pockets .
I do n't have time to start a new publication .
But I am in a position to help someone else start one , and to write a story or two for it now and then .
Financing 's in place .
So is a domain name .
So at some point the Herald and Herald - Tribune may have ( yet ) another niche publication competing with them .
It wo n't be a big competitor , but its ad revenue will come from lucrative business - to - business accounts you 'd think a local newspaper would be eager to lock up with a weekly ( or more frequent ) column for local computer - using business people .
This does n't mean the Herald has a bad editor or that another small paper would have reacted differently .
I use this anecdote only to point out that it is now easier to start an online publication than for even a highly - qualified outsider to get his or her work into a local paper .
Is it any wonder that local blogs and other online niche publications are springing up like mad ?
And as a corollary , is it any wonder that newspaper circulation and influence continues to decline ?
Newspapers need to open up more to the communities around them .
They need to stop confining their interaction with readers to advisory board meetings and questionnaires , and allow readers ' stories , opinions , and thoughts to become an integral part of the newspaper itself .
They should not allow readers to alter the newspaper 's own words , as the Los Angeles Times did back in June with their laughable wikitorial experiment .
Moderated comments are a much better way to give readers a voice .
So are journals that allow ( logged - in ) readers the same level of freedom they'd have with their own blogs , but also give them the cachet of being published on a " major brand " Web site .
The Herald , Herald - Tribune , and many other ( if not most ) local newspapers seem to think that they are still their readers ' primary source of national and international news , just as they were 20 years ago .
So that 's what fills their front pages most of the time , with local and regional news stuck in a " B " or " C " section .
Welcome to the Internet age , local newspaper ( and TV ) people .
I can and do get my national and international news from the New York Times , The Washington Post , BBC , Al Jazeera , Fox News , CNN , and other online media that cover faraway events better and faster than you ever will .
I turn to you fornews .
You tell me more about last week 's home invasion robbery on 11th Street East thanever will .
It 's time for local newspapers to become truly local ; to feature local news on the front pages of both their Web sites and print editions , with only a few out - of - the - area stories up front , augmented by an above - the - fold story list that tells readers where to find national and international news on their inside pages .
Add readers ' stories and comments to the mix and you suddenly have a local online community , not just a newspaper .
This will not take work away from professional reporters , photographers , and editors , who will still be the foundation of local news - gathering .
In fact , increased interaction with local community members will probably give them more work than ever , because they will find themselves inundated with news tips and story suggestions they never would have found on their own .
Some of these story ideas will be dreck and some will be invaluable .
It will be up to the newspaper 's editors to find the ( rare ) nuggets in the huge pile of dross they will need to sort through every day , and up to the newspaper 's reporters to follow up on them .
One important thing a community - oriented , Web - based newspaper must do isunless they specifically request anonymity .
Another good idea is toreaders who submit news stories that are written well enough that they can run with only routine editing and fact - checking .
Those readers are , in effect , doing a reporter 's work , and they should get some sort of compensation for it .
Some may even turn into stringers capable of covering government meetings and other events when staff reporters are n't available , and a few of those stringers eventually ought to become staff members .
After all , if a newspaper is going to be about , by , and for its local community , should n't that community be its primary recruiting ground ?
Some newspapers ( and newspaper chains ) will probably not survive the shift from news - as - monologue to news - as - dialog .
Most will , although those that wait too long to adjust will have much of their audience , influence , and ad revenue taken away by more agile competitors .
The smartest newspapers will follow my survival recipe or come up with their own way to become an integral part of their community instead of a building full of people who have been sprinkled with Secret Journalism Powder that makes them better and smarter than their readers .
These newspapers will not only survive , but prosper .
They may even become the prime outlets for bloggers in their communities , which willtheir readership and ad revenue .
Extreme ____-wing bloggers wo n't want their words associated with the hated Mainstream Media , but most others will be happy to have a widely - read , influential outlet for their work .
Eventually , I expect print newspapers to become " snapshots " of their Web editions taken at 1 a.m. or another arbitrary time , poured into page templates and massaged a little by layout people , then sent to the printing presses , a pattern that has potential for significant production cost reductions if handled adroitly .
From that point on , their paper editions will be distributed the same way newspapers are now .
Senior citizens and others who can't afford ( or do n't want ) computers are and will continue to be a viable market .
So will commuters who use public transportation .
Then there are those -- a substantial part of the population -- who simply prefer reading words and looking at pictures on paper to seeing them on a screen .
They will still want physical newspapers , even if they are not as up - to - date or as complete as what they 'd get on the Web .
However it is delivered , text will not go away anytime soon .
For a fast reader , it is the most efficient way to take in large quantities of information .
Most people speak at a rate of between 130 and 200 words per minute .
Most college students , according to a Virginia Tech student guide , can read non-technical material at 250 to 300 words per minute , and can increase that reading speed significantly with a little thought and practice .
Listening to a city council meeting at 150 words per minute takes much longer than reading a meeting transcript at two , three , four or ten times that speed .
Now have a skilled reporter -- whether a staff member , paid contributor or volunteer -- write an intelligent summary of that meeting , and even an average reader can learn what happened there in a few minutes instead of slogging through a two hour audio or video recording .
The Web version of that summary can be posted without waiting for the printing presses and delivery trucks to roll , and can have audio or video snippets embedded in it , but there is no reason not to make the text portion of it available on paper for those who prefer it in that form , unless the paper 's editors decide so few people are interested in a city council meeting that it does n't deserve a spot in the print version -- and tracking page readership on the Web version of the paper before the paper edition goes to press should give those editors a good idea of what they should and should n't put on paper .
Printed newspapers will have a significant following for many years to come .
They may or may not become " expensive , " as Professor Fisher predicts , but they will likely become smaller than they are now , and subscription sales efforts will probably be targeted more closely at groups unlikely to have Internet connections , especially senior citizens .
On the Web side , it 's likely that newspapers will end up keeping most of their content free , with specialty sections ( and posting privileges ) reserved for logged - in users .
Whether they 'll be able to charge for some or all of their Web content is questionable .
I paid $ 50 for a year 's subscription to the NYT's Times Select program , and I do n't think it 's a good enough value that I 'll renew my subscription when it runs out .
I would be more likely to pay if I lived in New York and that subscription , in addition to what it gives me now , offered access to additional features like complete transcripts of government meetings .
Indeed , I would happily pay at least $ 30 per year to the Bradenton Herald for a well - organized Web edition that gave me what I now get in the paper edition , plus government meeting transcripts and other useful subscriber - only features .
But if I paid for an online subscription to the Herald , I 'd probably drop my subscription to the paper edition .
I 'd still be the same person , with the same interests , earning power and spending habits .
The only thing that would change about me , from the newspaper 's perspective , would be my news delivery preference .
The challenge for local newspapers that beef up their Web editions at the expense of their paper versions wo n't be to keep ( or add ) readers , but to teach advertisers that the Web , not paper , is the best way to reach their most lucrative potential customers .
This may not be easy , but it will be a lot easier than explaining to advertisers why they should keep spending money in a newspaper that has fewer readers , and less influence , every year .

Jim Hough believes the hunt will soon deliver
Many expect it to be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of our age : " There 'll certainly be a Nobel Prize in it for somebody , " says Jim Hough .
The UK professor is standing on a farm road in Lower Saxony , Germany , with a crop of beet on one side and sprouts on the other .
But the real interest lies at his feet - with some shabby , corrugated metal sheeting .
For a moment , it looks like an upturned pig trough until you realise it stretches for hundreds of metres .
The sheeting hides a trench and , within it , the airless tube of an experiment Hough believes will finally detect the most elusive of astrophysical phenomena - gravitational waves .
The Glasgow University scientist has been chasing these " ripples " in space - time for more than 30 years and feels certain he is now just a matter of months away from bagging his quarry .
It 's equivalent to measuring a change of one hydrogen atom diameter in the distance from the Earth to the Sun
Prof Karsten Danzmann , Hanover University
" It will be a big event for two reasons : it will be yet another confirmation that Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity is correct , but it will also open up a new kind of astronomy that will allow us to look inside the most violent events in the Universe . "
A new kind of astronomy requires a new type of " telescope " , and that 's just what Hough and UK - German colleagues have been developing on farmland a short drive from Hanover .
It is called GEO 600 .
Its looks are deceptive .
Anonymous silver shacks house state - of - the - art electronics and a high - power laser .
A NEW VIEW ON THE COSMOS Gravitational waves are an inevitable consequence of the Theory of General Relativity
They describe the gravity force as distortions made by matter in the fabric of space - time Any moving mass will produce waves ; they are expected to propagate at the speed of light GEO 600 ( above ) fires a laser into L - shaped tunnels to detect their very weak signal
See how GEO 600 works
And then there is that trench - two in fact , running out at right - angles to each other for more than half a km .
Their vacuum tubes end in super - smooth mirrors slung by pure - glass wires from damped frames .
This is precision engineering at the extreme .
To have any hope of detecting gravitational waves , it has to be .
Unlike electromagnetic waves - the light seen by traditional telescopes - gravitational waves are extremely weak .
If one were to pass through your body it would alternately stretch your space in one dimension while squashing it in another - but the changes are fantastically small .
Any moving mass should send gravitational waves radiating outwards at the speed of light ; but only truly massive bodies , such as exploding stars and coalescing neutron stars , can disturb space - time sufficiently for our technology to pick up the signal .
Only certain objects and events will be detectable

" The displacement sensitivity of GEO 600 is one three - thousandth of the diameter of a proton , " explains Professor Karsten Danzmann , from the Albert Einstein Institute and Hanover University .
" Put another way , it 's equivalent to measuring a change of one hydrogen atom diameter in the distance from the Earth to the Sun . "
And it is these tiny deviations that GEO 600 hopes to measure in the laser light it bounces through its L - shaped tubes .
Cosmic symphony Careful refinement and tuning of the instrumentation has moved the installation very close to the required sensitivity - towards a possible " eureka " moment .
The UK - German team is working with US colleagues who have two similar facilities known collectively as Ligo - Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory .
Imagine being able to see the world but you are deaf , and then suddenly someone gives you the ability to hear things as well - you get an extra dimension of perception
Prof Bernard Schutz , Cardiff University
These set-ups , at Livingston in Louisiana and Hanford in Washington , employ laser arms that are 4 km long .
Both Ligo and GEO 600 are to begin a full " science run " in November , with the aim of gathering data continuously for 18 months .
In that time , they would expect to see perhaps two events , maybe more , that can be put down to a passing gravitational wave .
A detection would be confirmed if at least two of the widely separated installations record the same signal .
But , as great an achievement as that would be , it really is just the start .
The real aim is to have a new means of studying the Universe - to trace its exotic phenomena in detail in a way that does not rely on light .
Precision engineering is required to measure such tiny displacements " The analogy I like is this : imagine being able to see the world but you are deaf , and then suddenly someone gives you the ability to hear things as well - you get an extra dimension of perception , " explains Professor Bernard Schutz from the Albert Einstein Institute and Cardiff University .
" Up until now we 've only been able to see the Universe with our telescopes , but with gravitational waves we will be able to hear it as well ; and that 's going to convey a different type of information .
" Most of the Universe can not emit electromagnetic waves - we will never see it with light .
But we can see it , or parts of it , with gravitational waves . "
With this in mind , the scientists have even grander plans which go beyond merely upgrading GEO 600 and Ligo : they want to put an observatory in space .
BUILDING A NEW ASTRONOMY
Laser interferometers are being constructed across the world
The installations will see into the cores of exploding stars
They will make it possible to trace the outline of black holes Space observatories will probe the first moments of creation
The new knowledge may lead to a unified theory of physics Preparations for this mission , known as Lisa ( Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ) , are well advanced .
It would fire lasers between three spacecraft flying in formation and separated by five million km .
Lisa would allow scientists to look at lower frequencies than are possible on Earth , to signals that come from the merger of monster black holes .
Modelling also suggests it should be capable of detecting remnant radiation from the Big Bang itself , enabling science to probe the first moments of creation and perhaps pull together some of its contradictory theories .
" You do n't often get things that are very small that are also very massive but , of course , in the very earliest moments of the Universe we did , " says Professor Mike Cruise from Birmingham University .
" Some of these observations are going to give us a clue as to how gravity can be viewed in terms of quantum mechanics and the prospect of that is just mind - boggling . "
HOW A LASER INTERFEROMETER CAN CATCH THE ELUSIVE WAVES
Two super - dense neutron stars circling each other [ 1 ] are expected to emit gravitational waves that move out at the speed of light At GEO 600 , a high - powered laser [ 2 ] is fired at a ' beam splitter ' - a semi- transparent mirror - which divides the beam down two evacuated tunnels Mirrors [ a+b ] at the far ends bounce the light back ; more mirrors [ c+d ] extend the measuring distance , and yet more [ e+f ] are used to recycle the power and enhance the signal
The light paths from the separate arms are recombined and sent to a photodetector .
If a gravitational wave has passed through the observatory , it will have changed the length of the arms and the signal should be evident when analysed by computer
