KT Tunstall : Petting Tigers
I have to admit that I am a casual KT Tunstall fan , but when I heard she was performing an acoustic set this past Tuesday in NYC to debut material from her forthcoming album Tiger Suit , I made sure that I was there .
The talented folk - rocker stands out from the VH1 singer - songwriter set where she has received substantial media exposure .
She ’s got funk and spunk , and during her performance she charmed the audience with her fearless stage presence , cheeky jokes about celebs like Snoop Dogg and Lady Gaga and cursing over the fact that the electronic gear she brought with her to generate live loops and samples
had some technical difficulties .
After having played some warmup gigs at pubs in Scotland , Tunstall performed her first official show of the new album cycle at the Hiro Ballroom in Manhattan .
While she said she planned to return with a band , this particular concert featured her on acoustic guitar ( occasionally with programmed beats or self - generated percussion samples from vocal sounds or hitting her guitar ) , keyboards on one tune and even plugged - in with her Gretsch on a couple of tunes .
The vocalist / guitarist also sampled her own voice so she could sing along with herself .
While Tunstall occasionally struggled with the technology ( “ the pedalboard is too far from my foot ! ” ) , her self - deprecating sense of humor won over the crowd , who loved her even more for the flubs , which actually imbued her performance with an edgy vibe .
Tunstall ’s approximately 65 - minute performance included past and present material that worked well in the intimate setting .
Of the newer songs , standouts included the contemplative “ Still A Weirdo , ” which addressed her artistic evolution by looking at where she ’s come from , while the pulsating dance vibe of “ Push That Knot Away ” ( video clip below ) found her staring down adversity and crossing over into new territory ; she called it her attempt at writing something that sounds like Eddie Cochran meets Leftfield .
The upbeat “ Fade Like A Shadow ” also sounded strong and vibrant ( video clip below ) .
In explaining the album title Tiger Suit , Tunstall divulged that she used to have dreams of peacefully petting a tiger , then coming inside and realizing she could have been mauled .
Her rationale for her perpetual survival ?
She must have been wearing a tiger suit , which fooled the animal and is why it did n’t eat her .
Included in her older material were well - known gems like “ Hold On , ” “ Black Horse and the Cherry Tree ” ( with some nice , live sampled sounds ) and a rockin’ electric rendition of “ Suddenly I See ” .
And she closed the set with something she has never played before : a cover of LCD Sound System ’s “ New York , I Love You But You ’re Bringing Me Down ” .
This brisk set was certainly a nice way to whet fans ’ appetite for her upcoming tour and made me want to delve deeper into her work .
For those readers who might be surprised to find Tunstall covered here amid my metal , goth and horror ravings , I offer these interesting facts ( beyond my eclectic tastes ) :
She rocked a studded bracelet on her left wrist , performed beneath the ballroom ’s carved Chinese dragon head with glowing red eyes and admitted that as a child she had fangs and needed to have them chiseled down after hurting a fellow student .
KT Tunstall : Folk rocker , comedian , vampire .
Awesome .

Are voters truly sophisticated and rational decision makers ?
Apparently not .
Their choices are heavily influenced by superficial , nonverbal cues , such as politicians ' appearance , according to Christopher Olivola from University College London in the UK and Alexander Todorov from Princeton University in the US .
According to their findings1 , voters make judgments about politicians ' competence based on their facial appearance and these appearance - based competence judgments reliably predict both voting decisions and election outcomes .
The research is published in the June 2010 issue of the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior , a Springer publication .
The researchers also discuss the potential impact of these judgments on actual voters and show that appearance is most likely to influence less knowledgeable voters who watch a lot of television , a finding consistent with psychological models of persuasion .
Research to date suggests that rapid judgments about the personality traits of political candidates , based solely on their appearance , can predict their electoral success .
In other words , voters rely heavily on appearances when choosing which candidate to elect .
Since voters need to navigate their way through the flood of information available about candidates in order to make fully informed choices , it is no surprise that they take mental shortcuts to get to their final decision .
After reviewing the published literature on this topic , the authors then introduce a computer model of facial personality traits to identify the particular facial features associated with competence judgments .
By manipulating the degree of competence of faces on a screen , they are able to show that facial maturity and physical attractiveness are the two main criteria used by participants to make competence judgments .
Olivola and Todorov conclude : " Getting people to overcome the influence of first impressions will not be an easy task .
The speed , automaticity , and implicit nature of appearance - based trait inferences make them particularly hard to correct .
Moreover , often people do n't even recognize that they are forming judgments about others from their appearances .
" So how should the impact of appearances in politics be mitigated ?
According to the authors : " Controlling exposure to television and other media would be extremely difficult , so educating voters is likely to be a more realistic strategy .
" That does n't seem to be the thinking within the United States any more however there is the other possibility of being detained as a material witness and being kept either in confinement or not being allowed to leave the country until the Manning case is concluded . "
Sharia Law in Britain : A Threat to One Law for All and Equal Rights
Sharia Law in Britain – A Threat to One Law for All and Equal Rights
17 June 2010
New Report by One Law for All
“ Sharia Law in Britain : A Threat to One Law for All and Equal Rights ”
A report by One Law for All has found Sharia Councils and Muslim Arbitration Tribunals to be in violation of UK law , public policy and human rights ( see report here ) .
The report is being launched to coincide with a 20 June 2010 rally on the issue of Sharia law .
Based on an 8 March 2010 Seminar on Sharia Law , research , interviews , and One Law for All case files , the report has identified a number of problem areas :
– Sharia law ’s civil code is arbitrary and discriminatory against women and children in particular .
With the rise in the acceptance of Sharia courts , discrimination is being further institutionalised with some UK law firms additionally offering clients advice on Sharia law and the use of collaborative law .
– Sharia law is practiced in Britain primarily by Sharia Councils and Muslims Arbitration Tribunals .
Both operate on religious principles and are harmful to women although Muslim Arbitration Tribunals are wrongly regarded as being of more concern because they operate as tribunals under the Arbitration Act 1996 , making their rulings binding in law .
– Sharia Councils , on the other hand , claim to mediate on family issues but in practice often this differs little from arbitration : they frequently ask those appearing before them to sign an agreement to abide by their decisions ; they call themselves courts , and the presiding imams , judges .
Their decisions are then imposed and regarded as having the weight of legal judgements .
– There is neither control over the appointment of “ judges ” in Sharia Councils or Tribunals nor an independent mechanism for monitoring them .
Clients often do not have access to legal advice and representation .
The proceedings are not recorded , nor are there any searchable legal judgements , nor any real right of appeal .
– Sharia law cannot be compared to secular legal systems because it is considered sacred law that can not be challenged .
There is no scope to look at the interests of the individuals involved , as required by UK family law .
– These legal processes ignore both common law and due process , far less Human Rights , and provide little protection and safety for women in violent situations .
– There is a general assumption that those who attend Sharia courts do so voluntarily and that unfair decisions can be challenged in a British court .
Many of the principles of Sharia law are contrary to British law and public policy , and would in theory therefore be unlikely to be upheld in a British court .
In reality , however , women are often pressured by their families into going to these courts and adhering to unfair decisions , and may lack knowledge of English and their rights under British law .
Moreover , refusal to settle a dispute in a Sharia court can give rise to threats and intimidation , or at best being ostracised .
According to Maryam Namazie , spokesperson of the One Law for All Campaign and an author of the report , “ The existence of a parallel legal system that is denying a large section of the British population their fundamental human rights is scandalous .
Our findings show that it is essential to abolish all religious courts in the UK .
Their very existence and legitimisation puts pressure on vulnerable women not to assert their civil rights in a British court .
As long as Sharia Councils and Tribunals are allowed to continue to make rulings on issues of family law , women will be pressured into accepting decisions which are prejudicial to them and their children . ”
The report recommends that Sharia courts be closed on the grounds that they work against rather than for equality , and are incompatible with human rights .
Recommendations include :
initiating a Human Rights challenge to Muslim Arbitration Tribunals and / or Sharia Councils amending the Arbitration Act under which the Muslim Arbitration Tribunals operate in a similar way to which the Canadian equivalent of the Arbitration Act was amended in 2005 to exclude religious arbitration launching a major and nationwide helpline and information campaign to inform people of their rights under British law proposing legislation under the EU Citizens Rights Initiative to address the issue EU - wide , and strengthening secularism and the separation of religion from the state , the judicial system and education , in order to more fully protect citizenship rights .

Seems as though the GOP is doing all it can these days to show that it does not care about women , or minorities , and especially women who happen to be minorities .
The House passed a bill that would make it easier for tribal courts with limited sovereignty and jurisdiction to prosecute non-native rapists who rape Native American women on tribal lands .
There ’s a huge jurisdictional mess when it comes to crimes involving natives and non-natives due to confusion between tribal , federal , and state court authority .
It basically results in non-native rapists going free because it is difficult to ascertain what kind of court they should stand for trial in .
This bill helps to clear some of that up , and make it so rapists can be dragged into court much easier and made to stand for their crimes when the act is committed on tribal land by a non-member .
This is something pretty much anyone can get behind right ?
Nope .
Not if you ’re a conservative Republican apparently , as the only people who voted against this anti-rape legislation ( all 92 of them ) are card - carrying members of the GOP .
Here ’s the roll call if you want to see it for yourself :
clerk.house.gov
Pretty awesome huh ?
It ’s pretty scary that I live in a country where a major political party is obsessed with denying women any kind of control over their bodies , even when it comes to matters of sexual violence .
Absolutely disgusting .

Proceedings against opposition leaders
Over the past year , several of Kyrgyzstan 's well - known opposition leaders have been charged with offenses and imprisoned .
Prominent among them is Ismail Isakov , the former defense minister , who left the government to join the political opposition in October 2008 .
Isakov was arrested in late 2008 , and in January 2010 he was sentenced to 11 years in prison on corruption charges , allegedly for providing a government apartment to his son without proper documentation .
His imprisonment and sentencing prompted several demonstrations and a hunger strike .
Erkyn Bulekbaev , the leader of the Green Party , was arrested in April 2009 and charged with " instigating ethnic conflict . "
The authorities accused him of involvement in a clash between ethnic Russian and Kurdish people in a village of Chui province after a Kurdish man was accused of raping a young girl .
Bulekbaev , who as of February 2010 was still in custody , contends that he went to the village to try to help resolve the conflict .
On March 16 , 2010 , Alikbek Jekshenkulov , a former foreign minister and the head of the For Justice movement , was sentenced to a five - year prison term for financial wrongdoing , although the sentence was suspended , and he is no longer in custody .
He had been arrested in March 2009 and initially accused of complicity in the assassination of a Turkish citizen , though that charge was later dropped .
Developments in March
The political opposition took to the streets several times in March to protest government actions , ranging from the imprisonment of opposition leaders to alleged nepotism and mismanagement .
Peaceful protests on March 17 , in the lead - up to the national kurultai , or political assembly , held by the government on March 23 , drew thousands in Bishkek and in several other locations .
More protests were held on March 23 in Bishkek , as opposition demonstrators attempted to deliver a list of demands to the national gathering .
Protesters clashed briefly with police , and the police said that 19 protesters had been detained .
At the kurultai itself , which the government intended as a forum to start a political healing process in Kyrgyzstan , President Kurmanbek Bakiev said that there was " no certainty " that models of democracy based on elections and human rights " are suitable for all countries and peoples . "
Freedom of expression and information
In the days prior to the March 17 opposition demonstrations , at least four Internet providers in Kyrgyzstan - Kyrgyztelecom , Megaline , Aknet and Prohost - periodically blocked access to several websites , including Ferghana .
Ru , Centrasia .
Ru , White Sail ( a website that had been edited by Gennady Pavluk , an opposition journalist who was murdered in December ) , Livejournal and Azzatyk ( the Kyrgyz language service of Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty ( RFE / RL ) .
In addition , local broadcasters stopped airing the radio program of RFE / RL , and the Kyrgyz national broadcaster stopped retransmission of the BBC news programs , citing " technical problems . "
Other media freedoms have suffered considerable setbacks in recent months .
In March alone , courts in Bishkek ordered the suspension of three opposition Kyrgyz language newspapers : Forum , Achyk Sayasat ( Open Politics ) and Nazar ( Viewpoint ) .
The prosecutor investigated complaints lodged by the government that these newspapers had insulted the president and called for the overthrow of the government .
On April 1 financial police seized equipment in a raid on the Stan - TV offices , accusing the company of illegally using Microsoft software .
In February , a Kyrgyz court handed down five - year suspended sentences to two Kyrgyz policemen found guilty of beating a journalist , Almaz Tashiev , in 2009 .
Tashiev , 32 , who worked for the independent newspaper " Agym " ( Stream ) in Osh , subsequently died as a result of the beating .
Pavluk , a leading journalist in Kyrgyzstan , died on December 22 , 2009 , six days after he was thrown from the sixth floor of an apartment building in Almaty , Kazakhstan .
He was found unconscious with his hands and feet bound .
Pavluk was the founder of the Kyrgyz edition of the Russian weekly Argumenty i Fakty , and of White Sail .
Omurbek Tekebaev , leader of the opposition party Ata-Meken , said that Pavluk had started working on a website for the party prior to his death .
In December , a journalist and a well - known political analyst were beaten in Bishkek .
OnDecember 16 , two men wearing police uniforms beat Aleksandr Evgrafov , a journalist with the BaltInfo , a Russian - language news agency .
RFE / RL reported that the two men forced him into a car and warned him " not to write ‘ bad things ' about Kyrgyzstan . "
The political analyst , Aleksandr Knyazev , was beaten by unknown assailants , who stole his laptop computer .
Knyazev , who works for the Commonwealth of Independent States Institute , had been critical of the government 's foreign policy .

As part of a marketing campaign called " Fleet of the Future , " the second of up to 27 long range Airbus A330 and A350 aircraft was inaugurated into the fleet of Hawaiian Airlines on Tuesday .
The culturally significant inauguration ceremony in Honolulu was attended by several representatives of Hawaiian Airlines and Airbus , and also by Hawai ’i Governor Linda Lingle .
The ceremony opened with a blessing by Kahu Richard Kamanu of Kaumakapili Church and a Hawaiian chant called an ’oli .
Governor Lingle , Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO Mark Dunkerley , and Airbus Americas Chairman T. Allan McArtor each said a few words .
The ceremony closed with performances by a 110 - member high school marching band and more than 80 hula dancers .
The first of the two new A330 - 200s inaugurated into the fleet is named Makali’i , and arrived in Honolulu a month ago , after a Hawaiian - themed inauguration ceremony in Toulouse , France , the headquarters of Airbus .
The second of the two planes , called Hokule ’a , arrived in Honolulu last Saturday , after a 16 - hour non-stop flight from Toulouse ( IATA : TLS ; ICAO : LFBO ) to Honolulu ( IATA : HNL ; ICAO : PHNL ) .
Makali’i is the Hawaiian word for the ancient and world famous star cluster called the Seven Sisters in English , and Pleiades in Greek .
This collection of stars , visible on both sides of the equator depending on the time of year , guided Polynesian navigators for centuries .
It was visible high in the sky from Hawai’i on the night of Inter - Island Airways ’ first flight in 1929 .
( Inter - Island Airways became Hawaiian Airlines in 1941 . )
Hokule ’a , the name given to the second new A330 to arrive in Honolulu , simply means “ star of gladness ” in Hawaiian .
The two long hauls from Toulouse to Honolulu were a statement from Hawaiian Airlines that it means to fly routes to more distant destinations from its hub at Honolulu International Airport in the future .
The first flight with Makali'i will be to Los Angeles International Airport ( IATA : LAX ; ICAO : KLAX ) tomorrow .
( Hawaiian Airlines has not announced plans to fly non -stop between Honolulu and Toulouse regularly . )
Each of these new aircraft will seat 294 passengers , and will boast a number of modern tech - related conveniences for passengers in all seat classes to enjoy .
These amenities will include USB ports for iPod use , and LCD touch screen monitors .
Larger seats and additional tech - related features will be available in first class on these new planes .
Featuring prominently off to the side of the speakers at the inauguration ceremony was a full - size replica of the Bellanca CH - 300 Pacemaker which flew Inter - Island Airways ’ first flight in 1929 .
But the Pacemaker was dwarfed by Makali’i , which dominated the background directly behind the podium .
Airbus was formed in 1970 in a joint effort of the governments of France , the United Kingdom , and Germany .
It now produces around half of the world ’s jet airliners .
Hawaiian Airlines was the highest - rated air carrier in the United States last year for service quality and performance , according to the annual Air Quality Rating study .

“ We ( FDA & NIH ) have independently confirmed the Lombardi group findings . ” – Dr. Harvey Alter , National Institutes of Health
[ Note : In further breaking news as of June 30 , the Department of Health & Human Services has asked for a hold on the upcoming FDA & NIH article , owing to another paper set for publication by the CDC , claiming their researchers failed to confirm the Lombardi - Mikovits findings .
( This paper is also now on hold ) .
The NIH wants an explanation of the day & night discrepancy among three leading US scientific agencies .
See today ’s Wall Street Journal article , “ Chronic Fatigue [ Syndrome ] Link to Virus Disputed ” by Amy Docker Marcus . ]
Gendringen , the Netherlands , Jun 22 – The FDA and the NIH have independently confirmed the XMRV findings as published in Science , October last .
This confirmation was issued by Dr. Harvey Alter of the NIH during a closed workshop on blood transfusion held on May 26 - 27 in Zagreb .
Two journalists from the Dutch magazine for health professionals , ORTHO , who have been working on XMRV stories for several months , were able to obtain a copy of the Alter lecture .
In the October 8 , 2009 issue of Science Express , the Lombardi-Mikovits group at the Whittemore Peterson Institute ( WPI ) , the Cleveland Clinic , and the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) reported that 67 % of 101 chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) patients tested positive for infection with xenotropic murine retrovirus ( XMRV ) .
Only 3.7 % of 218 healthy subjects tested were positive for this gammaretrovirus .
Since that time , a number of research groups have proved unable to independently confirm these findings .
On Friday last ( June 18 , 2010 ) , the AABB [ formerly American Association of Blood Banks , now with members in 80 countries ] released an Association Bulletin recommending that its member blood collectors actively discourage potential donors who have been diagnosed with CFS from donating blood or blood components .
This interim measure was proposed by the AABB Interorganizational Task Force on XMRV .
This Task Force includes representatives from several government agencies , including the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
The fact that the measure was introduced suggests the presence of information not yet published .

The ORTHO journalists were able to obtain a pdf document of the lecture given by Harvey Alter at the IPFA / PEI 17th Workshop on ‘ Surveillance and Screening of Blood Borne Pathogens ” in Zagreb .
The International Plasma Fractionation Association ( IPFA ) represents the not - for - profit organizations around the world involved in plasma fractionation .
The IPFA is based in Amsterdam , the Netherlands .
The highly - experienced Dr. Harvey Alter is Clinical Studies Chief at the Infectious Diseases and Immunogenetics Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda , Maryland .
• “ The data in the Lombardi , et al .
Science manuscript are extremely strong and likely true , despite the controversy , ” was one comment on the XMRV findings reported by Alter in Zagreb .
• “ Although blood transmission to humans has not been proved , it is probable .
• “ The association with CFS is very strong , but causality not proved .
• “ XMRV and related MLVs are in the donor supply with an early prevalence estimate of 3 % to 7 % . ”
• “ We ( FDA & NIH ) have independently confirmed the Lombardi group findings . ”
ORTHO contacted Dr. Harvey
Alter today for a reaction .
He did not want to comment , but confirmed that a paper is soon to be published .
[ Ed Note : See also Hillary Johnson ’s blog ( “ THE BIG ONE , June 21 , 2010 ” ) stating she ’s learned by the grapevine that an article now in press at “ a highly respected journal ” may provide new , “ even stronger ” data connecting XMRV with ME / CFS than the Mikovits article .

The field of data visualization is much broader than most people conceive of it , and exploring this breadth was one of our primary goals in compiling the projects described in “ Beautiful Visualization . ”
In the following excerpt , KickMap designer Eddie Jabbour explains the complexity he faced and the trade - offs he made while reinventing one of the most iconic maps in the world .
What follows is Eddie Jabbour ’s story , as told to Julie Steele :
Learn faster .
Dig deeper .
See farther .
Maps are one of the most basic data visualizations that we have ; we ’ve been making them for millennia .
But we still have n’t perfected them as a tool for understanding complex systems — and with 26 lines and 468 stations across five boroughs , the New York City subway system certainly is complex .
The KickMap is the result of my quest to design a more effective subway map , and ultimately to encourage increased ridership .
The need for a better tool
I was born in Queens and raised in Brooklyn .
The first subway map I saw was my father ’s , circa 1960 .
It made a vivid impression on me because it intimidated me .
I saw a gray New York with red , green , and black lines running all over it like a grid ( see Figure 5 - 1 ) , and hundreds of station names attached ( 1 ) .
It reminded me of a complex electrical diagram that I could n’t understand ; it looked very “ adult - serious ” and even a little scary .
I hoped I ’d never have to deal with it .

London calling
In college I majored in design , and I spent half a year studying at the University of London .
I was all on my own in a huge city I had never been to before .
I quickly learned that the London Underground was the way to get around and that the “ Tube map ” was the key to understanding it .
That map ( which of course is the acclaimed Beck map seen in Figure 5 - 2 ) was brilliantly friendly : simple , bright , functionally colorful , designed to help users easily understand connections between lines , and physically tiny .
Folded , it fit easily into my pocket , to be whipped out at a second ’s notice for immediate reference ( which I did often ! ) .
Figure 5 - 2 . Harry Beck ’s map of the London Underground makes a complex system appear simple and elegant .

London was a medieval city , and therefore its street pattern is random .
You cross a crooked intersection and the name of the street you ’re on changes .
There ’s no numbered grid to provide a frame of reference ( like in New York ) , and moving through the city can be a disorienting experience .
The genius of the Beck map is that it makes order out of this random complexity , with the River Thames as the only visual ( and geographic ) point of reference to the aboveground world .
And for that reason , the map ’s layout is iconic : when you think of London , you probably think of that Tube map .
But even as a design student , I did n’t think much about the form of it at the time — it was just so simple and easy to use that travel felt effortless .
The combination of that effective little map and my unlimited monthly “ Go As You Please ” pass allowed me to use the Underground daily to explore London .
I went anywhere and everywhere with ease and got the most that I could out of that great city .
The Tube map imparted information so quickly and clearly that it became an indispensable tool and an integral part of my experience .
It made me feel that London was “ mine ” after only a couple of weeks of living there .
What a fantastic and empowering feeling !
In fact , I formed such a warm attachment to that valuable tool that at the end of my stay , just before I left the city , I went to my local Underground station and got a brand new Tube map , and when I returned home to New York I had it framed .
New York blues
When you come back to your own city after six months away , you look at everything with new eyes .
When I got back to New York , I saw our subway map — really saw it — for the first time since I was a kid .
And I thought , compared to London ’s , our subway map is poorly designed .
I remember thinking that the New York subway map was the opposite of the Beck map : huge in size , unruly in look , cluttered , and very nonintuitive .
I realized that this map was in many ways a barrier to using our great subway system — the opposite of the Tube map , whose simplicity was a key to understanding and using the Underground .
Even as a designer , however , if I ever thought of creating my own subway map I must have quickly dismissed the idea .
This was in the late 1970s , and I ’m not a T - square kind of guy .
The amount of discipline and mechanical time it would have required for anyone but an experienced draftsman to undertake such an endeavor was unthinkable in that precomputer era .
The map ’s deficiencies left my mind as I pursued my design career .
Like most New Yorkers , I used the subway map rarely and never carried it .
This was in part because of its size : it was as large as a foldout road map .
If I needed the map ’s information to get to a new location , I would tear out the relevant six - inch square portion from a free map in the station and throw the rest of it in the trash !
I often saw tourists struggling with the physical map and felt bad for them , remembering my great experience as a student in London .
Better tools allow for better tools
Now , fast - forward to one night years later when I was taking an out - of - town client to dinner at a downtown restaurant .
As we waited for the train , he confided to me that New York ’s subway intimidated him .
I was surprised : the crime and grime of the 1970s - 1990s were virtually gone from the system , and I was proud of our shiny new air - conditioned cars and clean stations .
But in our conversation on the way downtown , I realized that his fear lay in not being able to decipher the complexity of the system : all the lines and connections .
That ’s when I realized that the problem for him , too , was the map .
My client was very well traveled and urbane ; if he found the system intimidating , then there really was something wrong with the communicator of that system — the map .
At that moment the subway map re-entered my consciousness , and it has n’t left since .
It was 2002 .
I had my own design agency and my own staff , each of us with our own computer loaded with a copy of the greatest and most elegant graphic design tool available .
I realized that now , just one person using a graphic design program like Adobe Illustrator had the power to create his own subway map !
And I challenged myself to do something about the map .
Size is only one factor
When I decided to try making a new map as a weekend project ( ha ! ) , the first thing I considered was the size .
Since the New York City subway system has about twice as many stations as London ’s , I decided to give myself twice as much space as the Tube map takes .
( Even doubling the size of the Tube map , the result was about one - fifth the size of the existing New York subway map . )
First , I took a paper version of the official Metropolitan Transit Authority ( MTA ) map ( a version of which is shown in Figure 5 - 3 ) , cut it up with scissors , and put it back together in a more efficient way ( literally with Scotch tape ) , just to see the possibilities .
I was encouraged as I managed to reduce the area by more then half .
Gone were the 56 bus pop-up boxes and other nonsubway information !
Then came the laborious task of creating an actual map .
I entered all the station names and lines into an Illustrator document , and in two months , voilá !
I had my very own smaller map !
I folded it and easily put it in my wallet , and I carried it around and showed it to all my friends .
They liked its size , but of course nobody wanted to actually use it , because it still had many of the major design issues that made the MTA map difficult to use .
Figure 5 - 3 . The 2004 version of the MTA New York City subway map , based on a design by Michael Hertz .
Besides its visual complexity , incomplete information missing on the map itself forces the the user to rely on the complex charts in the lower right section — right where sitting people block its view in the subway cars — and in the stations where this information , displayed on large posters , is also difficult to read since it is often less than 18 inches off the ground .

It was one thing to reduce the size , but another thing to realize that the way the data was presented was not the best way to present it .
So I asked myself : how would I present all this data ?
To answer this question , I had to ask a few more :
What maps came before this map ?
Were there any previous conceptions that were discarded but perhaps still relevant ?
What was it about New York City and its subway that historically made it so difficult to map clearly and efficiently ?
Looking back to look forward
I did a research dive , and I started buying old transit maps on eBay .
I studied subway maps , New York City street maps , and transit maps from all over the world that I had collected on my travels .
I filtered through all the design approaches and eclectically took as much as I could from ideas that had already been implemented ( some brilliantly ) .
Of course , in addition to the map designed by George Salomon that had been my father ’s subway map , I studied carefully the map designed by Massimo Vignelli ( see Figure 5 - 4 ) , which the MTA used from 1972 until 1979 , when it was replaced by the Tauranac - Hertz MTA map ( which , 30 years later , still prevails ) .
Vignelli ’s map appealed to me immediately because , although big , it took obvious inspiration from Beck ’s Tube map , with its 90 - and 45 - degree angles , explicit station connections , and the use of color to denote individual lines .
There were also some smart aspects of the current MTA map that I wanted to keep , despite finding it on the whole unwieldy because there is so much information crammed onto it .
In addition , I borrowed liberally from other past efforts that had been discarded or forgotten .

New York ’s unique complexity
As I conducted my research , I started to realize that New York City had its own unique set of challenges that made its subway system impossible to accurately and clearly map using just a diagrammatic method , as other cities like London , Paris , and Tokyo had done .
It was also clear that a pure topographic mapping approach would n’t work , either ; New York ’s unique geography and its gridiron street system both have an impact on mapping its subway system .
There are four significant and conflicting aspects of the New York City subway system that make it impossible to successfully map with either a strict diagrammatic or topographic format :
The narrow geography of the principal thoroughfare , Manhattan Island , which has 17 separate subway lines running up and down Midtown alone in a width of six city blocks .
The “ cut and cover ” method used to construct subway tunnels and elevated lines that follow the city ’s gridiron street patterns .
Because New York City ’s subway generally follows its gridded street routes , there is a strong psychological link between the subway and the aboveground topography that is not found in a medieval city like London .
The unique system of many of the subway lines running local , then express , then local again along their routes .
Its formative history , with the current system evolving from three separate and competing subway systems ( the IRT , BMT , and IND ) that were poorly coordinated to work as a whole system .
( The chaotic tangle of these three competing routes , as they meander and fight their way through the dense street plans of lower Manhattan , downtown Brooklyn , and Long Island City , is the most difficult part of the system to map clearly and accurately . )
The KickMap , shown in Figure 5 - 5 , is based on a combination of ideas I selectively borrowed from many earlier maps ( some dating back to the 19th century ) and my own innovations .
I believe that this unique combination makes my map easier to use than most of the preceding efforts .
In the following sections , I ’ll discuss my inspirations and innovations in more detail .
Figure 5 - 5 . The KickMap as it was released in 2007 .
Geography is about relationships
Most of the boroughs — Queens , Brooklyn , Manhattan , and to some extent , the Bronx — already have a grid on top of the subway system because of the way the streets were planned .
This makes the aboveground geography not only an intuitive starting point , but also an integral part of the user ’s experience .
Knowing your location — take 42nd Street and 7th Avenue as an example — places you in the grid , which makes it easy to judge distances and locations .
This is why the numerous geographical errors that appear in New York City subway maps ( like the Vignelli map infamously placing the 50th Street and Broadway stop west of 8th Avenue instead of east ) are so glaring and easy to spot .
One of the issues I have with some previous versions of the New York subway map is that I have a hard time believing that the designers ever actually rode the subway as an integral part of their lives in the city .
There ’s a disconnect between many of the decisions they made and the reality of the subway .
As part of my design process , I rode the lines and exited the stations at every major intersection with which I was unfamiliar .
There is a strong relationship in New York between the aboveground and the belowground , and since subway riders do n’t cease to exist when they leave the subway , it ’s important for the map to express this relationship as clearly as possible .
Otherwise , the result is an uncomfortable feeling of disorientation .
Include the essentials
Consider the L line in Brooklyn .
As a passenger on the train , you ’re jostled around as you travel and you do n’t really notice that the line is curving or turning corners along major streets and intersections .
But when you get out at the Graham Avenue station , for instance , it ’s obvious that Metropolitan Avenue and Bushwick Avenue are two major thoroughfares that intersect each other at a right angle .
Why would n’t that show up on the map ?
If you did n’t know how the streets intersected and you just saw a sign for one or the other as you came out of the subway , it would be very difficult to figure out what was going on .
On the Vignelli map , this portion of the L is depicted as a straight line ( see Figure 5 - 6 [ a ] ) .
The Hertz map ( Figure 5 - 6 [ c ] ) shows both Metropolitan and Bushwick Avenues , but the line resembles nothing so much as a wet noodle as it half - heartedly depicts the route .
I chose to carefully draw a stylized but accurate line describing the path as it runs along each major avenue there , believing this to be the best approach because it is the most helpful to riders ( Figure 5 - 6 [ b ] ) .
Figure 5 - 6 . A portion of the L line in Brooklyn as depicted by ( a ) the Vignelli map , ( b ) the KickMap , and ( c ) the Tauranac - Hertz map .
Conversely , I sometimes made stylistic simplifications to the geography in order to help riders .
For example , Queens Boulevard , a major thoroughfare in Queens , was originally five different farm roads , and as a result it jigs and jogs a bit as it makes its way from the Queensboro Bridge east across the borough .
Recent maps did n’t capture its relationship to the subway because they either ignored it entirely ( as in the Vignelli map , shown in Figure 5 - 7 [ a ] ) or obscured it ( as in the current MTA map , shown in Figure 5 - 7 [ c ] ) .
On my map , I styled Queens Boulevard as a straight line ; see Figure 5 - 7 ( b ) .
I chose to do this so that users could easily see its path and identify the “ trade - off ” subway lines that travel along it — where one subway line runs along the road and then veers off and another line takes its place .
In this case , the 7 line runs along Queens Boulevard until it veers off along Roosevelt Avenue , and the R/V / G/E/F lines come down from Broadway and pick up its path east .
My stylized approach uses logic to better convey the subway ’s relationship to the streets of Queens , which is not clearly apparent on either the Vignelli map or the current MTA map .
Figure 5 - 7 . The trade - off along Queens Boulevard as depicted by ( a ) the Vignelli map , ( b ) the KickMap , and ( c ) the current MTA map .
Another “ trade - off ” I felt it was important to show clearly is at 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan , where the 4/5/6 line jogs over from Park Avenue to Lexington Avenue ( see Figure 5 - 8 ) .
A would - be rider walking along in Midtown or Murray Hill needs to know which street to go to for a subway entrance .
The Vignelli map obscures the shift by treating it as a straight line , relying on text to convey the road switch , and once again the current MTA map is at best vague and noodley .
In my map , it ’s clear which way the user should go .
Figure 5 - 8 . A portion of the 4/5/6 line in Manhattan as depicted by ( a ) the Vignelli map , ( b ) the KickMap , and ( c ) the current MTA map .
Leave out the clutter
While I felt that it was important to show certain shapes aboveground , I also felt that it was important to leave out certain pieces of belowground information .
There are several places where the subway tunnels cross and overlap each other beneath the surface .
This may be important information for city workers or utility companies trying to make repairs , but for the average commuter , showing these interactions just creates visual noise .
I tried to reduce that noise by cleanly separating the lines on the map so they do n’t overlap .
Consider the different depictions of the 4 line and the 5 line in the Bronx ( Figure 5 - 9 ) ; sure , the MTA ’s paths may be accurate , but they ’re also confusing , and riders do n’t really need to see those particular details to understand where they ’re going .
Figure 5 - 9 .
The 4 line and the 5 line as depicted by ( a ) the KickMap and ( b ) the current MTA map .
Coloring Inside the lines
The belowground geography is important , but it ’s more vital for the users to understand which belowground lines will take them where they want to go .
In 1967 , the MTA moved past the tricolor theme used on the Salomon and earlier maps and began to use individual colors to illustrate individual lines .
However , this shift did n’t help simplify the system .
It essentially had 26 lines assigned 26 random colors , which did n’t really tell the user anything beyond illustrating the continuity of a given route .
Vignelli ’s map ( Figure 5 - 10 [ a ] ) continued with this color system .
The Tauranac - Hertz ( current MTA ) map attempted to simplify things by collapsing multiple subway lines onto one graphic line , but this actually made understanding the subway system more complicated , as now you had to read the text next to each and every station to learn whether a specific line stopped there or not ; see Figure 5 - 10 ( c ) .
What it did get right was that it color - coded sets of subway lines that use the same track — for example , the A/C / E lines are all blue , and the 4/5/6 lines are all green .
If you look at the “ trunk ” lines that run north and south through Manhattan , the colors move from blue to red to orange to yellow to green , creating a spectrum effect .
These colors are memorable and help riders discern which lines will take them in the general direction they want to go .
In my map , I preserved the best elements of both approaches ; see Figure 5 - 10 ( b ) .
I reused the spectral colors on the trunk lines , highlighting an elegance and reality inherent in the system that Tauranac - Hertz understood , but kept it clear by representing each route with its own graphic line .
Technically , I did what Vignelli did in that I used 26 distinct colors , but I grouped them in six or seven families of color and used different shades for each line in a given family : the A/C / E lines use shades of blue , the 4/5/6 lines use shades of green , and so on .
Figure 5 - 10 .
The Manhattan “ trunk ” lines as depicted by ( a ) the current MTA map , ( b ) the KickMap , and ( c ) the Vignelli map .
I also made use of line IDs and colors for the station dots ( 2 ) .
The crucial idea here was that the map should be quickly scannable , rather than just readable .
At each station where a line stops , I placed the name of that line inside a dot : this way , users can easily see exactly which trains stop at which stations without having to read a list of lines next to each station name .
Use of different colored dots enables users to tell at a glance whether the train always stops there or has special conditions , such as weekday / weekend or peak hour / off - peak hour restrictions .
Finally , there are about 80 stations in the city where , if you ’ve missed your stop , you ca n’t just get out and conveniently switch direction .
I highlighted these locations by placing a small red square next to the station name , indicating to riders who need to turn around which stations to avoid if they do n’t want to have to leave the station , cross the street , and re-enter the station on the opposite side .
The current MTA map shows all the heliports in the city but does n’t provide users with this simple but important piece of subway information — a perfect example of its confused priorities .
I believe that taken together , these decisions highlight the innovations that make the KickMap more useable than those that came before it .
Sweat the small stuff
Those decisions were easy for me , but other choices were more difficult .
Which geographic features did I really need to keep ?
What angles should I use ?
How much bus and ferry information should I include ?
So , after creating my first comprehensive map that met my initial challenges ( Figure 5 - 5 ) , I decided to refine it and incorporate all of my learning .
I was excited .
Try it on
In the car industry , it is common to build what is called a test mule , which is a prototype or preproduction car into which every possible experimental feature is crammed ; that prototype then undergoes a series of drivability tests to determine what should be removed ( because it ’s not essential or does n’t work quite right ) .
I did the same thing with my map : I created a version ( shown in Figure 5 - 11 ) into which I put every feature that I might possibly want .
Illustrator ’s layers feature really came in handy here ; I put a lot in this map that I ultimately turned off or toned down .
Figure 5 - 11 .
My version of a test mule for the map : I put lots of information in and then edited it down .
The mule map allowed me to evaluate a variety of trade - offs , such as :
The street grid —
I wanted to present the structure of the streets without interfering with the subway info wherever I could .
You ’ll notice that the mule map includes a lot more streets and street names than the final design .
Beaches —
I thought green spaces were important , and that New Yorkers should be able to find their way to beaches by subway rather than by car .
My mule map included municipal swimming pools as well , but ultimately I decided to remove them .
Coastline features —
It was important that real people — like , say , my mom — could easily use this map , and she could n’t care less about certain geographic details ( like Steinway Creek or Wallabout Bay ) that I included in the mule map .
That was a reason to simplify and stylize .
But I also wanted to make something any map geek or lover of New York City ( like me ! ) could appreciate .
So , there were instances where I let my passion take over .
I decided to pay homage to certain subway feats , so I included features like the Gowanus Canal , which the Smith / 9th Street station crosses and has to clear ( at 91 feet , it ’s the highest elevated station in the system ) .
Angular design —
In the final design I standardized a lot of the angles , but I broke that standardization if I had to for clarity ’s sake .
I was n’t a slave to the angles .
Stylization is fine , but my goal was to take the stylization and make it work so that riders can always understand what ’s going on aboveground .
I also decided to consistently place station names on the horizontal for easier reading , like on the London Tube map , instead of cramming them in at arbitrary angles .
Bridges and tunnels —
One of my goals for this project was to come up with a tool that would encourage people to take the subway instead of a car .
For this reason , I decided to leave out all the car bridges and tunnels ( except for the iconic Brooklyn Bridge ) .
I wanted to keep the experience of navigating the subway as clean and easy as possible , without the temptation of using a car , to encourage users to keep riding .
Many of these choices were influenced by the following principle .
Users are only human
There are certain New York icons that help orient the rider and are reassuring .
To the extent that they represent something familiar , maps can be quite emotional .
So , I saw preserving such icons as a way to build friendliness into this tool .
I did not design a geographically precise topographical map ; I designed a map that is emotionally and geographically accurate in a relational sense — Manhattan looks like Manhattan , Central Park is green , the Hudson River is blue , and the subway stations are positionally accurate in relation to one another and the streets ( Delancey Street is shown east of the Bowery , etc. ) .
For the same humanistic reason , I included certain celebrated landmarks — the Statue of Liberty , Ellis Island , and the Brooklyn Bridge .
And I did n’t just include them with nametags ; I actually included their familiar shapes , as was done on subway maps back in the 1930s ( 3 ) .
A city of neighborhoods
When I travel on the subway to see my mom , I ’m not going to see her at the 95th Street subway station ; I ’m going to see her at her home , which is in Bay Ridge , Brooklyn .
This is an important aspect of New York : it is a city made up of neighborhoods , and native New Yorkers think of the city in those terms .
That ’s our frame of reference : we travel from , say , Washington Heights to Bay Ridge .
The current MTA subway map includes some neighborhood names , but they are just dark blue words that compete with the station names and do little to describe the areas .
There ’s no hierarchy of information .
By color - coding the neighborhoods — which has been done on maps of the city since at least the 1840s — in an unobtrusive way ( using pastel tones ) and writing their labels in white text so they would n’t visually interfere with the black text of the station names , I was able to provide layers of information without compromising the clarity and functionality of the subway map .
Again , these elements were literally created in separate digital layers in Illustrator .
This allowed me to turn the neighborhoods on and off to determine what really needed to be there and to make several variations of the subway map with and without them .
One size does not fit all
I believe that separating functions is an important key to any useful visualization or tool .
Another benefit of the layered approach was that it allowed me to custom - tailor the map to the user interface later .
The KickMap is available as iPhone and iPad applications , and in that context , the map ’s detail automatically changes as the user zooms in or out .
Besides the apps , commuters still read subway maps in many different contexts : there is the foldout printed version , the huge ones they hang in the stations , the ones they post in the train cars ( right behind the seats so that you have to peer past someone ’s ear to read them ) , and the one that is posted online .
Currently , you get basically the same map in each place , but that should n’t be the case : in each context , a slightly different version , optimized just for that specific environment , should be available .
Each version should have its own design , tailored to the context in which it appears .
The big maps that hang in the stations , for instance , should show you the neighborhoods , but the one in the subway car that riders reference to make quick decisions , like whether to get off at the next station , need not .
And why does the map in the subway car have to give you all that bus information ?
Contexts are n’t just physical , either .
After 11:00 pm in New York , 26 routes reduce to 19 .
So , in addition to the main day / evening KickMap , I made the night map shown in Figure 5 - 12 .
Instead of relying on a text - heavy , hard - to - read chart at the bottom of a one - size - fits - all map to determine when a certain route is available , a night map should be available to riders ( not only on their iPhones , but also in the subway cars ) .
Figure 5 - 12 .
The night version of the KickMap shows only the lines that run between 11:00 p.m. and 6:30 a.m .
When it came to making a night map , I simplified the day / evening version and took out most of the street and neighborhood information , as it seemed redundant .
Also , I do love the simple and elegant aesthetic of Beck ’s Underground map , and keeping the night map ’s form simple pays homage to it !
Conclusion
Ultimately , I do think the KickMap accomplished most of my goals : to make the subway lines and their connections as clear as possible for easier navigation , and to provide users with a clear representation of where they are once they exit a station so that the subway feels familiar and welcoming to all .
My main goal , however , was to get my map out there into the hands of subway riders .
After the MTA rejected my design , I found an alternative way to distribute it , via Apple ’s iTunes — two apps , one free and one paid , for the iPhone , iPod Touch , and iPad .
All of the choices I made were aimed at trying to make the user experience as seamless and pleasant as possible .
Clearly I ’m striking a chord , as over 250,000 people ( and counting ) have now downloaded copies of the KickMap from iTunes .
That ’s really great but I still want the KickMap — or something superior — to replace the current one in the subway system .
I want people to be comfortable and even happy when using our unbeatable 24 - hour subway system .
It is a complex system , but if people know how easy it can be — if the map becomes a friend ( 4 ) instead of an obstacle — ridership will increase .
Ultimately , that benefits not only the system itself , but also all of us who live , work , visit , and breathe here .

Notes :
1. I now know that map was an early version of the Salomon map .
Years later , when I was doing research for the creation of the KickMap , I got to appreciate the beauty of the design of this map .
2 . This was a big aha moment in my process .
3 . I wanted to put the Empire State Building in there , but it would have cluttered up Midtown , and my goal all along was that it really had to be a simple and functional subway map !
4 . I think many people are passionate about the subway map as a great symbol of New York .
The map shows the subway as kind of a dynamic capillary system nourishing the city .
This is true not only conceptually but also historically : the subway was built to “ nourish ” new residential areas with cheap transportation to and from the central business districts so the City could continue to grow and thrive .

Back in March I outlined an idea
for a Perl module for accessing the video service Viddler .
As I
noted , at the time , while there was plenty of support for the Viddler
Application Programming Interface via PHP , the support for Perl was
quite anemic .
To help rectify the situation , in my
“ copious ” free time I ’ve been working on an Perl module that
wraps around Viddler ’s API .
The goal being to provide a quick method
for integrating Perl - based applications with Viddler .
Today , I ’m happy to announce the first working release of my effort , WebService : : Viddler , which can be found at
CPAN ( Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ) .
As I mentioned , at the heart of things ,
WebService : : Viddler is an object - oriented encapsulation of the
Viddler video platform providing a Perl specific focus for access via their public API , which
itself is documented at :
http://developers.viddler.com/documentation/api/
Currently this module is , at best , beta quality code and only
supports version 1 of the Viddler API .
Moreover , while it handles most of the
v1 API methods , it currently lacks support for the two commenting
related methods , videos - comments - add and videos - comments - remove ( a
more complete To Do list can be found in the provided README file .
Of course the advantage of the module is that it makes including
Viddler in a Perl - based application , dead simple :
#!/usr/bin/perl
- T use strict ; use warnings ; use WebService : : Viddler ; use Data : : Dumper ; # Create our object and establish a session my $ videos = new WebService : : Viddler ( apiKey => ' 123456ABCDEF ' , username => $ username , password => $ password , ) ; # Get and print the API version is use print " API Version : " .$videos->api_getInfo ( ) . "
" ; # Upload a video providing required information such as the # title , tag and description $ videos-> videos_upload ( " Moon " , " Moon " , " A little video clip of ... " , " 0 " , " /home/pdw/temp/Moon.mp4 " , " " ) ; #
Get the details of the given video and # use Data : : Dumper help print out the values in the list results print Dumper ( $ videos->videos_getDetailsByUrl( " http://www.viddler.com/explore/pdweinstein/videos/3/ " ) ) ; #
Get a list of videos by the given tag and # use Dumper to help print out the values in the list results print Dumper ( $ videos->videos_getByTag ( " moon " ) ) ;
Questions , bugs and code suggestions are of course welcomed !

Hopefully , since there 's no official compo running right now , everyone 'll get in on this regardless .
Maybe , but it was announced kinda quiet that unless you were paying attention you would have missed it .
I should have something though .
I suspect I 'll be up most of the night getting it done since I missed most of last night and today .

Es gibt ja Menschen , die rot sehen , wenn sie Gysi hören .
Schade für sie .
Denn ihnen entgehen manche guten Analysen und auch manche vernünftigen Therapievorschläge .
Ich hatte erst jetzt Gelegenheit , Gysis Rede vom 21 .
Mai nachzulesen , und kann danach auch jenen mit einer Gysi-Blockade nur empfehlen , sich solche Texte nicht entgehen zu lassen .
Siehe Anhang .
Leider müssen die Anhänger anderer Parteien begreifen , dass aus ihren Reihen wegen enger Verflechtung mit der Finanzindustrie kaum erhellende Analysen und weiterführende Vorschläge kommen .
Albrecht Müller
Einige – lückenhafte – Anmerkungen vorweg :
Interessant sind Gysis Anmerkungen zum Schuldenerlass .
Wie auch zur Parole , wir lebten über unsere Verhältnisse .
Wie auch zur Verantwortung von Rot und Grün für die De-Regulierungen auf den Finanzmärkten usw .
Leider hat auch Gysi vergessen oder unterlassen , die immer noch bestehende Steuerbefreiung beim Kauf und Verkauf von Unternehmen und Unternehmensteilen , die zum 1.1.2002 eingeführt wurde , zu kritisieren und ihre Beseitigung zu verlangen .
In den Zwischenfragen und Zwischenrufen wie auch in Gysis Text wird die Verflechtung der Vertreterinnen und Vertreter anderer Parteien mit den Interessen der Finanzwirtschaft sichtbar .
So wenn die SPD - Abgeordnete Hendricks versucht , zwischen gefährlichen Private Equity Fonds und den „ guten “ Hedgefonds zu unterscheiden .
Nur den Ersteren habe die Warnung Müntefering vor Heuschrecken gegolten .
Die Suche nach Ausflüchten aus der Verantwortung und auch ein Stück dreisten Dummstellens wird in den Zwischenfragen von Hendricks , Künast und Trittin sichtbar .
Gysi erwartet von der Transaktionssteuer eine Hilfe im Kampf gegen Spekulation .
Das wird sie aus meiner Sicht bei den genannten Steuersätzen nicht leisten können .
Eine Kurskorrektur und die Wiedergewinnung der Unabhängigkeit von der Finanzindustrie ist mit den etablierten Parteien CDU , CSU , SPD , Grüne und FDP offensichtlich allein nicht möglich .
Dies jedenfalls lernt man auch in dieser Debatte wieder .

Herr Präsident !
Meine Damen und Herren !
Herr Altmaier , ich habe
Ihnen sehr genau zugehört und war einigermaßen erstaunt .
Wenn ich das richtig verstehe , ist man Ihrer Meinung nach proeuropäisch , wenn man für Aufrüstung , für Sozialabbau und für eine falsche Verschuldung ist , und antieuropäisch , wenn man für Frieden , Abrüstung und jeden Verzicht auf Sozialabbau ist .
Ich kann dem nicht folgen , überhaupt nicht .
( Beifall bei der LINKEN )
Wir sind für die europäische Integration , aber für eine vernünftige .
( Beifall der Abg. Dr. Barbara Höll ( DIE LINKE ) )
Wahr ist , dass wir heute über eine Schicksalsfrage entscheiden , und zwar für unsere Gesellschaft und für Europa .
Ich darf
Sie daran erinnern , dass dieser Bundestag bei der Finanzkrise innerhalb einer Woche entschieden hat , einen Rettungsschirm für Banken und Versicherungen im Umfang von 480 Milliarden Euro aufzuspannen , ich darf Sie daran erinnern , dass dieser Bundestag innerhalb einer Woche beschlossen hat , einen Rettungsschirm für Griechenland im Umfang von 110 Milliarden Euro mit einem deutschen Anteil von über 22 Milliarden Euro aufzustellen ,
( Florian Pronold ( SPD ) : Keinen Cent mehr ! )
und ich darf
Sie daran erinnern , dass heute , wieder innerhalb einer Woche , dieser Bundestag eine Euro - Rettung im Umfang von 750 Milliarden Euro mit einem deutschen Beitrag von 148 Milliarden Euro beschließen will .
Frau Bundeskanzlerin , Sie lesen meine Rede nachher sowieso heimlich ; hören Sie doch lieber gleich zu .
( Beifall bei der LINKEN Michael Grosse - Brömer ( CDU / CSU ) : Einbildung ist auch eine Bildung ! )
Einmal abgesehen davon würde ich Ihnen gerne eines sagen : Wenn wir hier im Bundestag einmal um 1 Million Euro für einen sozialen oder einen kulturellen Zweck kämpfen , dann dauert es neun Monate , bis wir das „ Nein “ hören .
Wenn es aber um zig Milliarden Euro geht , dann wird in diesem Bundestag alles innerhalb einer Woche entschieden .
Das müssen Sie der Bevölkerung einmal erklären .
( Beifall bei der LINKEN – Norbert Barthle ( CDU / CSU ) : Übertreibungen ! )
In diesen Wochen wurde zwar immer über viel Geld entschieden , aber es wurde nie entschieden , endlich eine Regulierung der Finanzmärkte einzuführen .
Die Leerverkäufe , die spekulativen Kreditausfallversicherungen , die Hedgefonds :
Alles lief weiter wie vorher auch .
Damit haben
Sie die Spekulanten und Banker doch animiert , auf erhöhte Staatsschulden zu wetten .
Die gegenwärtige Krise ist die logische Konsequenz aus der Finanzkrise vom Oktober 2008 und Ihrer falschen Bewältigung , weil Sie eine riesige Staatsverschuldung organisiert haben , die jetzt von den Spekulanten und den Bankern wieder genutzt wird .
Das erste Opfer in der EU war übrigens gar nicht Griechenland , sondern die ersten Opfer waren Ungarn , Rumänien und Lettland .
Sie waren am Ende , und dann gab es Milliarden vom Internationalen Währungsfonds und von der EU .
Lettland hat daraufhin genau den Kurs beschritten , den Sie jetzt auch Griechenland , Spanien und Portugal vorschreiben .
Dort wurden die Löhne um 25 Prozent gekürzt in der Privatwirtschaft sogar um 30 Prozent , die Mehrwertsteuer erhöht und die Zuschüsse für Krankenhäuser um 43 Prozent gesenkt .
Die Folge ist ein Rückgang der Nachfrage im Einzelhandel um 30 Prozent , ein Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit auf 22 Prozent das ist der höchste Stand in der EU und ein Schrumpfen der Wirtschaftsleistung .
Hier stellt sich die Frage man muss sie der Bevölkerung einmal beantworten , warum wir uns hier trotzdem nicht mit Ungarn , Rumänien und Lettland beschäftigt haben .
Das geschah aus einem Grund nicht :
Sie haben keinen Euro und konnten ihre Währungen uns gegenüber abwerten .
Das funktioniert bei Griechenland , Spanien und Portugal nicht ; denn wir haben eine Binnenwährung gemeinsam mit ihnen .
Ich darf
Sie noch einmal daran erinnern , dass wir hier Schilder mit der Aufschrift „ Euro so nicht “ hochgehalten haben .
Wir haben niemals „ Euro nein “ gesagt .
Wir haben „ Euro so nicht “ gesagt , weil wir vorher eine Steuerharmonisierung und eine Harmonisierung der sozialen und ökologischen Standards sowie der Löhne gefordert haben .
Sie alle waren aber schlauer und haben gesagt :
Das alles brauchen wir nicht .
Wir führen den Euro gleich ein .
Jetzt bezahlen wir die Quittung dafür .
Sagen
Sie hier doch einmal ehrlich : Die Linken hatten recht , und wir hatten unrecht .
Das müssten Sie einmal über Ihre Lippen bringen .
( Beifall bei der LINKEN – Volker Kauder ( CDU / CSU ) :
Wenn es einmal so wäre , dann würde ich es sagen ! )
Jetzt verlangen
Sie von Griechenland , Portugal und Spanien das habe ich ja schon gesagt , dass sie den
Weg gehen , den Lettland schon falsch gegangen ist .
Wissen Sie , wie das Ganze aussieht ?
Ein Beispiel : Ein Bäckermeister , der fast pleite ist , bittet um einen Kredit .
Sie sagen : Ja , du bekommst den Kredit , aber unter zwei Bedingungen : Erstens musst du deine beiden Verkäuferinnen entlassen , und zweitens musst du von deinen zwei Backöfen einen verkaufen .
Hinterher ist er dann noch mehr pleite als vorher .
Das ist die Art von Politik , die Sie betreiben , und das kann nicht gut gehen ; denn der Sozialabbau ist nicht nur ungerecht , sondern dadurch wird auch die Wirtschaft gedrosselt .
Was ist denn , wenn sich ein Land immer stärker verschuldet ?
Man braucht dann doch Wachstum , um die Schulden zurückbezahlen zu können .
Wenn Sie die Wirtschaft aber drosseln , dann heißt das , dass Sie gar nicht in der Lage sind , die Schulden zurückzubezahlen , es sei denn , Sie nehmen neue Schulden auf .
Wenn
Sie dann neue Schulden aufnehmen , dann wird die Verschuldung immer größer , und die Spekulanten und Banken wetten und zocken dann gegen dieses Land , wie wir es jetzt erleben .
Wir kennen das auch aus Mexiko und aus anderen Ländern .
Was passiert dann ?
Dann wird der Weg beschritten , die Schulden teilweise zu erlassen .
Das ist auch interessant : Darüber sprechen ja nur Josef Ackermann , Thomas Mayer , der Chefvolkswirt der Deutschen Bank , und wir , die Linken .
Es ist auch interessant , warum das so ist .
Ich kann Ihnen den Grund dafür erzählen : Das geschieht , weil schon durch die öffentliche Debatte darüber eine neue Spekulationswelle ausgelöst werden kann und weil Ackermann und andere durchaus daran interessiert sind , dass es eine neue Spekulationswelle gibt .
Warum ?
Wenn die Staatsverschuldung sozusagen gestrichen wird , dann bekommen sie ihre Verluste voll erstattet , weil sie Kreditausfallversicherungen abgeschlossen haben .
Selbst wenn sie keine Staatsanleihen haben , haben sie etwas davon , weil sie zusammen mit anderen bei den Kreditausfallversicherungen darauf gewettet haben , dass Griechenland und andere Länder nicht pünktlich zurückzahlen .
Auch dann kriegen sie eine dicke Marge an Geld .
In beiden Fällen nutzt es ihnen , aber nur ihnen .
Insofern kann ein Schuldenerlass zwar sinnvoll sein , aber nur unter der Bedingung , dass wir vorher eine Regulierung vornehmen , die ausschließt , dass solche Spekulationsgewinne entstehen .
Genau das muss passieren , und das fordern wir ein .
Denn alles andere bedeutete , dass die Mittel , die wir heute beschließen , wieder nur zugunsten der Banken und Spekulanten fließen .
Genau das können wir nicht zulassen .
( Beifall bei Abgeordneten der LINKEN )
Frau Bundeskanzlerin , Sie müssen doch merken , dass Sie am Nasenring durch die Manege geführt werden .
Man muss sich das klarmachen : Die EU - Finanzminister müssen bis zu einer bestimmten Uhrzeit eine Entscheidung treffen , weil dann die Tokioter Börse öffnet .
Merken
Sie denn nicht , dass das die Demokratie beschneidet ?
Warum sind wir von einer Börse abhängig ?
Warum können wir nicht wieder die Herrschaft der Politik über die Finanzwelt begründen ?
( Dr. Martin Lindner ( Berlin ) ( FDP ) : Die Linke hätte die Öffnungszeiten verschoben ! )
– Nein , die Linke hätte Regulierungsmaßnahmen beschlossen , die uns längst aus der Situation herausgebracht hätten .
( Dr. Barbara Höll ( DIE LINKE ) : Genau ! )
Im Unterschied zur FDP hätten wir darauf geachtet , durch ein Primat der Politik über die Wirtschaft und Finanzwelt die Demokratie wiederherzustellen .
Ich komme aber noch auf die Alternativen zurück .
FDP und Union haben in einem Punkt recht : Die Hedgefonds , die Leerverkäufe und die gesamte Deregulierung des Finanzmarktes sind von SPD und Grünen eingeführt worden .
( Jörg van Essen ( FDP ) : So ist es ! )
Die ehemalige Staatssekretärin
Hendricks hat uns dafür kritisiert , dass wir das sagen , ohne hinzuzufügen , dass die Hedgefonds in Deutschland besonders reguliert sind , während das in Großbritannien nicht der Fall ist .
Liebe Frau Hendricks , dazu muss ich Ihnen sagen , dass Ihr damaliger Parteivorsitzender Müntefering hinsichtlich der deutschen Hedgefonds darauf hingewiesen hat , dass diese wie Heuschrecken wirken .
Die Kritik kam gar nicht von uns .
So toll war Ihre Regulierung keineswegs .
( Beifall bei der LINKEN – Joachim Poß ( SPD ) : Reden Sie hier nicht so einen Stuss ! )
Sie sind noch einen anderen falschen Weg gegangen .
Sie sind nämlich den
Weg der Staatsverschuldung durch falsche Steuersenkungen gegangen .
Ich darf
Sie daran erinnern , dass Sie die Körperschaftsteuer von 45 auf 25 Prozent gesenkt haben .
Sie haben den Spitzensteuersatz bei der Einkommensteuer von 53 auf 42 Prozent gesenkt .
Sie haben keine Börsenumsatzsteuer eingeführt , und Sie haben auf die Vermögensteuer verzichtet .
Das alles hat zu einer gigantischen Verschuldung geführt .
Die Große Koalition von Union und SPD ist diesen
Weg weitergegangen .
Sie haben die Körperschaftsteuer von 25 auf 15 Prozent gesenkt .
( Joachim Poß ( SPD ) : Machen Sie mal eine Pause ! )
Nun macht Ihre Koalition das Wachstumsbeschleunigungsgesetz und schenkt den Hotels und Unternehmen weitere 2,4 Milliarden Euro .
Genauso haben
Sie die Staatsverschuldung verursacht .
Präsident Dr. Norbert Lammert :
Herr Kollege Gysi , gestatten Sie eine Zwischenfrage der Kollegin Hendricks ?
Dr. Gregor Gysi ( DIE LINKE ) :
Ja , selbstverständlich .
Dr. Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) :
Das , was Sie gerade zu den Steuersenkungen im Hotelgewerbe gesagt haben , ist völlig richtig .
Darin stimme ich Ihnen vollständig zu .
Ich darf Ihnen aber trotzdem einen kleinen Hinweis geben : Die Finanzmarktsituation ist vielfältig und kaum durchschaubar .
Deswegen will ich
Sie darauf hinweisen , dass sich der Begriff Heuschrecken , der in diesem Zusammenhang von Franz Müntefering geprägt wurde und der sich völlig zu Recht durchgesetzt hat , nicht auf Hedgefonds , sondern auf Private Equity Fonds bezogen hat .
Franz Müntefering hat darauf hingewiesen , dass die Private Equity Fonds kommen , die mittelständischen Unternehmen aussaugen , um sie dann fallen zulassen und weiter zuziehen .
Das sind nicht die Hedgefonds , sondern die Private Equity Fonds .
Dr. Gregor Gysi ( DIE LINKE ) :
Schönen Dank für Ihren Hinweis .
Aber die Hedgefonds betreiben genau dasselbe .
Auch dass die Situation unübersichtlich ist , verdanken wir übrigens Ihnen .
Ihr damaliger Bundesfinanzminister hat mir gegenüber gesagt
( Renate Künast ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Immer , wenn du nicht durchblickst , sind andere schuld ! )
– ich bin gleich fertig mit der Antwort , dass es bei der Zulassung von Hedgefonds und Leerverkäufen nur um die Frage ging , ob wir Kreisklasse bleiben oder Weltklasse werden .
Nun sind wir in einer Weltklassekrise .
( Beifall bei der LINKEN – Jürgen Trittin ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Aber deine Rede ist nicht mal Kreisklasse ! )
Ob Rot -Grün , Schwarz - Rot oder Schwarz - Gelb : Deutschland wurde zu einem Niedrigsteuer­land und liegt nun am Ende der Europäischen Union beim Steueraufkommen .
Hätten wir nur Steuereinnahmen im EU - Durchschnitt , hätten wir 120 Milliarden Euro jährlich mehr .
Dann kamen die Milliardenbeschlüsse für Banken und Versicherungen .
Diese haben dann eine gigantische Staatsverschuldung ausgelöst , auf die nun Banker und Spekulanten setzen .
Nun gibt es eine neue neoliberale
These .
Frau Bundeskanzlerin , Frau Bundeskanzlerin !
Sie sagen im Ernst , Jahrzehnte hätten wir über unsere Verhältnisse gelebt , und erklären den Satz gar nicht .
Was meinen Sie eigentlich ?
Was glauben Sie , wie ein solcher Satz auf Arbeit­nehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer , auf Renterinnen und Rentner , auf Arbeitslose und Hartz - IV - Empfängerinnen und Hartz - IV - Empfänger wirkt ?
Wen meinen Sie denn : die Rentnerinnen und Rentner , die in den letzten fünf Jahren real über 8,5 Prozent an Rente verloren haben ?
Meinen Sie die Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer , die in den letzten zehn Jahren real 11,3 Prozent an Löhnen verloren haben ?
Meinen Sie die Beschäftigten in prekären Beschäftigungs­verhältnissen , also die Leiharbeiterinnen und Leiharbeiter , die befristet Beschäftigten , die Teilzeitbeschäftigten , die Aufstockerinnen und Aufstocker oder die Minilohnbeschäftigten ?
Meinen Sie die 1 - Euro - Jobberinnen und - Jobber , oder meinen Sie die 7 Millionen Hartz - IV - Empfängerinnen und Hartz - IV - Empfänger ?
Ich finde es einen Skandal , diesen Menschen zu erklären , dass sie über ihre Verhältnisse gelebt hätten .
Was mich wirklich ärgert , Frau Bundeskanzlerin , ist , dass
Sie nicht einmal sagen : Die Bestverdienenden , die Vermögenden , die Banker und die Spekulanten haben über ihre Verhältnisse gelebt .
Das ist doch unser Problem und nichts anderes .
Wir brauchen bei uns genauso wie in der gesamten EU Steuergerechtigkeit .
Es gibt heute nicht nur mehr Armut .
Auch der Reichtum ist angewachsen .
Wer bezahlt das Ganze ?
Die durchschnittlich Verdienenden tragen die Hauptlast .
Das sind die Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer .
Das sind die Handwerksbetriebe .
Das sind kleine und mittelständische Unternehmen .
Ich nenne nur den Steuerbauch als Beispiel .
Unsere Einkommensteuer verläuft nicht geradlinig , sondern sie hat einen Bauch .
Die durchschnittlich Verdienenden müssen mehr zahlen , weil Sie den Spitzensteuersatz gesenkt haben .
Genau das ist nicht hinnehmbar .
Lassen Sie uns den Steuerbauch überwinden !
Aber dann müssen wir den Spitzensteuersatz erhöhen , weil es sich anders überhaupt nicht rechnet .
Jetzt haben
Sie ungedeckte Leerverkäufe verboten .
Dazu habe ich eine Frage .
Die ungedeckten Leerverkäufe sind zuerst von Rot -Grün erlaubt worden .
Dann waren sie verboten .
Dann , lieber Herr Bundesfinanzminister , waren sie ab Januar aus mir unerklärlichen Gründen wieder erlaubt .
Jetzt haben
Sie sie wieder verboten , aber befristet .
Warum denn nicht endgültig ?
Sagen
Sie doch endlich : Schluss , wir wollen diese Art der Spekulation nicht ; sie ist für immer verboten .
Nun wird über eine Finanztransaktionsteuer geredet ; das ist wirklich spannend .
Zuerst haben nur wir sie vorgeschlagen .
Inzwischen sind alle für eine Finanztransaktionsteuer
( Widerspruch bei der SPD )
Ja , ich weiß , Attac hat einen Teil vorgeschlagen .
Ich freue mich für Attac .
Aber die SPD stand bei dieser Frage ganz hinten , um das hier ganz offen zu sagen .
Ich möchte aber von der Bundeskanzlerin wissen : Ist das nur Gerede , oder kommt diese Steuer tatsächlich ?
Wenn sie tatsächlich kommt : Kommt dann die Variante der FDP ?
Eine reine Gewinnsteuer können
Sie doch vergessen .
Da wird doch dann geschummelt , was das Zeug hält .
Oder erheben wir endlich eine Steuer auf alle nationalen und internationalen Finanzgeschäfte ?
Dann sind auch die Börsenumsatzsteuer und die Tobin - Steuer einbezogen .
Dann haben wir eine sehr vernünftige Finanztransaktionsteuer , die nicht nur hohe Einnahmen bringt , die wir dringend benötigen , sondern auch die Spekulation endlich begrenzt .
Das muss unser Ziel sein .
Nun kommt das bekannte Gegenargument , das gehe nur , wenn es weltweit oder zumindest in Europa geschehe .
Der österreichische Bundeskanzler Faymann hat dazu Folgendes gesagt ich darf zitieren , Herr Präsident :
Aber man soll die internationale Ebene nicht als Ausrede verwenden , nur weil man verschleiern will , dass man nichts aus der Krise gelernt hat und Spekulanten verschonen will .
Recht hat der österreichische Bundeskanzler in dieser Frage !
Recht hat er !
Ich werde Ihnen auch begründen , warum .
Die Finanzwelt kann weder die Börse in New York noch die in Tokio noch die in London noch die in Frankfurt am Main ignorieren .
Bekanntlich verlässt die internationale Finanzwelt auch nicht die Schweiz ; darin werden Sie mir sicherlich Recht geben .
Ich nenne Ihnen zwei Länder , die eine Börsenumsatzsteuer eingeführt haben : Groß Britannien und die Schweiz .
Das Gerede , dass deshalb die Finanzwelt verschwindet , ist einfach albern ; es stimmt nicht .
Es kommt noch etwas hinzu : Wenn eine Bank mit Euro handeln will , dann braucht sie eine Lizenz der Europäischen Zentralbank .
Wenn Banken Europa also Richtung Japan und USA verlassen sollten , dann entziehen wir ihnen einfach die Lizenz .
Was glauben Sie , wie schnell sie zurück sind !
Das ist ganz einfach .
Zusammenfassend lässt sich feststellen , dass es nur zwei Möglichkeiten gibt : Entweder lässt sich die Bundesregierung weiterhin von den Bankern und Spekulanten treiben , oder sie begründet endlich wieder eine politische Herrschaft über die Finanzwelt , das heißt , die Demokratie wird gestärkt .
Entweder
Sie haben endlich den Mut , die Banken , die großen Unternehmen , die Bestverdienenden und die Vermögenden gerecht zu besteuern , oder Sie sorgen dafür , dass auch in Deutschland eine Politik des sozialen Kahlschlags betrieben wird , eine Politik , die nicht nur grob ungerecht ist , sondern auch die Nachfrage so zurückgehen lässt , dass die Binnenwirtschaft unermessliche Schäden erleidet .
Die Folgen für die Gesellschaft sind überhaupt nicht absehbar .
Nur wenn
Sie die Finanzmärkte regulierten und garantierten , weder die Mehrwertsteuer zu erhöhen noch Sozialabbau zu betreiben , könnte man über eine Zustimmung zu Ihren verschiedenen Paketen nachdenken .
Solange es aber dabei bleibt , dass nicht Sie , sondern die Banker und Spekulanten regieren , solange sie sich weder trauen , gerechte Steuern zu erheben , noch , Sozialabbau auszuschließen , kann es von uns nur ein Nein geben .
Wie gesagt :
Es geht heute um eine Schicksalsfrage für unsere Gesellschaft und für Europa .
Sie entscheiden heute mit darüber , ob es wieder eine Herrschaft der Politik gibt , ob wieder Demokratie herrscht oder ob es bei der Herrschaft der Spekulanten und Banken bleibt , sodass es kaum Demokratie gibt .
Das ist die Frage , um die es heute hier geht .
Danke .

Peter Altmaier
Zügiges Gesetzgebungsvorhaben in Übereinstimmung mit den Vorschriften
Rede in der Geschäftsordnungsdebatte ( GO - Debatte zur ZP.13 )
Zweite und dritte Beratung des von den Fraktionen der CDU / CSU und FDP eingebrachten Entwurfs eines Gesetzes zur Übernahme von Gewährleistungen im Rahmen eines euro­päischen Stabilisierungsmechanismus
> Drucksache 17/1685 < Beschlussempfehlung und Bericht des Haushaltsausschusses ( 8. Aus­schuss ) > Drucksache 17/1740 < ( v. 19.05.2010 ) Herr Präsident !
Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren !
Wir beraten und entscheiden heute über eines der wichtigsten Gesetzgebungsvorhaben der letzten Jahre .
( Renate Künast ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Was ? )
Gerade weil dies so ist , sollten wir im Interesse der Legitimation und der Legitimität dieses Parlaments gemeinsam das zum Ausdruck bringen , was über jeden Zweifel erhaben ist : dass das Gesetzgebungsverfahren zwar zügig , aber in Punkt und Komma in Übereinstimmung mit den gesetzlichen Vorschriften und den Vorgaben der Geschäftsordnung durchgeführt worden ist .
( Beifall bei der CDU / CSU und der FDP )
Wir haben es mit einem ganz normalen , regulären Gesetzgebungsvorhaben zu tun , wie es in der Geschichte dieses Parlaments schon häufig vorgekommen ist .
( Jürgen Trittin ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Plus Wortbruch der Kanzlerin ! )
Darum geht es Ihnen ja auch nicht , Frau Enkelmann .
Tun Sie nicht so !
Führen Sie die Leute nicht hinter die Fichte , indem Sie irgendwelche Quisquilien und technischen Argumente anführen !
Ich will Ihnen etwas vorlesen : Vertrag von Maastricht , 1992 : CDU / CSU , SPD , FDP : ja , Linke : nein .
Vertrag von Amsterdam , 1997 : CDU / CSU , SPD , FDP : ja , Linke : nein .
( Beifall bei Abgeordneten der LINKEN ) Vertrag von Nizza : CDU / CSU , SPD , FDP : ja , Linke : nein .
( Beifall bei Abgeordneten der LINKEN ) Verfassungsvertrag - da hatten Sie keinen Fraktionsstatus , es waren nur zwei MdBs vertreten -: Stimmverhalten : nein .
Vertrag von Lissabon : ebenfalls nein .
( Beifall bei Abgeordneten der LINKEN )
Heute reden wir über ein weiteres europäisches Vorhaben ersten Ranges , und Sie sagen wieder Nein .
Sehr geehrter Herr Gysi , sehr geehrte Frau Enkelmann , wir haben eine Partei vor uns , die zutiefst antieuropäisch empfindet und sich destruktiv verhält .
( Beifall bei der CDU / CSU und der FDP ) Solange Sie diese Haltung nicht ändern , werden wir Sie im parlamentarischen Verfahren nicht als Partner akzeptieren .
( Lebhafter Beifall bei der CDU / CSU und der FDP ) Herr Präsident , meine Damen und Herren , soweit ich weiß , wird sich Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen heute Morgen dem Antrag der Linkspartei anschließen .
( Jürgen Trittin ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Weil wir der Kanzlerin geglaubt haben ! )
Ich will hier in aller Deutlichkeit sagen , Herr Trittin : Im Gegensatz zur Linkspartei ist die europäische Überzeugung von Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen über jeden Zweifel erhaben .
( Beifall bei Abgeordneten der CDU / CSU , der FDP und des BÜNDNISSES 90 / DIE GRÜNEN )
Das haben
Sie in den letzten Jahren in diesem Parlament wiederholt bewiesen , zuletzt bei der Verabschiedung des Griechenlandpaketes .
Das ist auch ein Beweis für demokratische Reife .
( Zurufe vom BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN )
Nur , Herr Trittin , ich habe nicht verstanden , wie Sie bei der Frage des Griechenlandpaketes ein mutiges Signal Ihrer europäischen und demokratischen Reife geben konnten und jetzt , 14 Tage später , so tun können , als hätten Sie mit all dem nichts zu schaffen , und dies unter Berufung auf zugegebenermaßen wichtige , aber technische Fragen im Zusammenhang mit diesem Gesetzgebungsvorhaben .
( Jürgen Trittin ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Technisch ? )
Wir haben im Haushaltsausschuss mit Ihrer Unterstützung die Beteiligungsrechte des Parlamentes verschärft .
Die Bundesregierung ist ihrer Verpflichtung nachgekommen .
Wir haben Ihnen die Eckpunkte der Zweckgesellschaft vorgelegt .
Wir haben darauf hingewiesen , dass es in der Sache keine Änderungen und keine Regelungen geben wird , die dem Parlament nicht vorher mitgeteilt werden .
( Dr. Dagmar Enkelmann ( DIE LINKE ) : Das ist nicht entscheidend !
- Volker Beck ( Köln ) ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Das Parlament ist mehr als ein Haushaltsausschuss !)
Ich kann
Ihnen sagen , was seit der Entscheidung zu Griechenland geschehen ist : Die SPD hat sich damals in die Büsche geschlagen , und nun hoppeln Sie in die Büsche hinterher .
Nur - das sieht man in Nordrhein - Westfalen - ist die SPD schon längst einen Busch weiter .
( Beifall bei der CDU / CSU und der FDP - Renate Künast ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Darüber müssen
Sie ja selber lachen ! )
Deshalb sage ich Ihnen : Sie sollten sich an Ihrem Altmeister Joschka Fischer orientieren .
Ich bin davon überzeugt , dass Joschka Fischer , wenn er in dieser Situation Vorsitzender der Grünenfraktion wäre , sagen würde :
Wir können doch in einer politischen Gestaltungsfrage ersten Ranges nicht über eine haushaltsrechtliche Einzelfrage den Kurs der Grünen bestimmen .
( Lachen des Abg. Jürgen Trittin ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) )
Wenn er heute Morgen vor dem Fernsehschirm sitzt , wird er Ihnen - wahrscheinlich nicht der Fraktion , aber den beiden Fraktionsvorsitzenden - vermutlich seinen Lieblingsspruch zurufen : Avanti Dilettanti !
( Beifall bei der CDU / CSU und der FDP ) Ich bin am Ende meiner Ausführungen .
Herr Steinmeier ist nicht da , Herr Gabriel ist nicht da .
( Thomas Oppermann ( SPD ) : Der ist da !
Er ist hinten ! ) - Wunderbar . - Ich will am Ende noch einmal einen Appell an die sozialdemokratische Partei in diesem Hause richten .
Wir haben seit den 50er - Jahren alle grundlegenden Fragen der europäischen Integration bei vielerlei Unterschieden im Detail gemeinsam diskutiert und gemeinsam entschieden .
Sie haben sich bei der Griechenlandfrage für Enthaltung entschieden .
Sie haben gesagt :
Wir wollen ein klares Signal , dass die Märkte und die Banken an den Kosten der Krise beteiligt werden .
Das war auch unser Anliegen .
( Lachen bei Abgeordneten der SPD und des BÜNDNISSES 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) Wir - CDU / CSU und FDP gemeinsam - sind Ihnen in dieser Frage mit einer klaren Aussage entgegengekommen .
Die Märkte haben das realisiert .
In ganz Europa wird die Bundesrepublik Deutschland als Vorkämpferin für eine bessere Regulierung und eine vernünftige Eindämmung der Spekulationen angesehen .
( Beifall bei der CDU / CSU und der FDP - Lachen bei der SPD , der LINKEN und dem BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) Nur Sie wollen das nicht wahrhaben , weil Sie glauben , dass Sie damit die eine oder andere Stimme gewinnen können .
( Jürgen Trittin ( BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN ) : Es ist Pfingsten , nicht Karneval ! )
Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren , wir entscheiden heute über sehr viel Geld .
Es ist eines der wichtigsten Gesetzgebungsvorhaben , nicht nur , weil es um Geld geht , sondern weil es im Kern um die Frage geht , ob wir es schaffen , unser Modell der sozialen Marktwirtschaft in einer globalen
Welt zu verteidigen .
Dazu sind wir bereit , und dafür möchte ich Sie noch einmal um Ihre Unterstützung bitten .
Vielen Dank .

Let ’s cross our fingers on this one , and I mean really really cross them , because it looks like Sprint is gearing up to announce the Android 2.2 update for the HTC EVO 4G tomorrow morning .
A few devices will probably be involved in an early test round kicking off along with the announcement , with the OTA starting to roll out to all handsets beginning August 1st .
But if Froyo on the EVO just is n’t enough to get you all hot about the month of August , you should be more than happy to know that the planned update will bring more than just that .
The update also comes with an assortment of new widgets , a flashlight mode for the on - board LED flash , and some enhancements to video recording ( including improved 720 p video quality and the ability to use the LED light during camera recording ) .
Sprint has named the update as “ high priority for competitive reasons , ” which does n’t come as much of a surprise given the recent rumors of concurrent Froyo updates for all major Verizon handsets , the Droid 2 launching with Android 2.2 , and even the Galaxy S inching closer to an updated OS .
Sounds like Sprint is ready and rearing to go , the only thing that could stop them now is some unfortunate situation on HTC ’s part .
Sounds like all the doting over delayed Android 2.2 updates might have been for nothing , but we wo n’t speak so soon .
We just hope they all come as quickly and concurrently as recent news has suggested .

Three Philadelphia Police officers ended up on the other side of the law Tuesday after they were indicted in a drug conspiracy case .
Officers Robert Snyder , Mark Williams and James Venziale allegedly used their positions in the police department to steal and then resell 300 grams of heroin from known drug dealer Miguel Santiago , says U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger .
Unfortunately , the person they allegedly sold the stolen drugs to was an undercover agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration .
According to the federal indictment , the defendants believed that the individual who was to receive the heroin was a money launderer and drug dealer .
To carry out their plan , Officers Williams and Venziale allegedly staged the arrest of dealer Angel Ortiz following a courier drop off on May 14 .
During that arrest , the officers seized the heroin with the intention of reselling it , the indictment states .
The two officers received $ 6,000 for the seizure and fake arrest from Ortiz , according to the document .
Prosecutors also allege Officer Snyder ’s wife Christal was involved in the crime .
Through texting and phone calls , Christal reportedly passed information back and forth between Ortiz and the three officers .
She received an unnamed payment for her role in the conspiracy , the indictment said .
Officers Snyder , Williams and Venziale work in the city ’s 25th and 39th Districts .
Santiago , from whom the heroin was allegedly stolen , faces charges of distributing and aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin .
He is still on the run .
Venziale is accused of distributing and aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin , as well as conspiracy .
Robert and Christal Snyder face conspiracy charges and using a telephone to execute a drug conspiracy .
Young , Ortiz and Williams face conspiracy charges and distributing and aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin .
They were also charged with using a telephone as part of their conspiracy .
If the defendants are found guilty , they will face maximum sentences ranging from 44 to 212 years in jail .
Controversial billboards promoting atheism today appeared in Auckland , Wellington and Christchurch , after NZ Bus refused to run the ads on bus sides .
The New Zealand Atheist Bus Campaign last year raised more than $ 22,000 to fund ads to run on buses , but NZ Bus declined to run them after receiving a number of complaints from the public and staff .
The group announced last month the ads would appear on billboards instead , while takine a discrimination case against NZ Bus .
The New Zealand campaign organisers had chosen three winning phrases from more than 900 public submissions to an online billboard generator .
The three slogans appearing on billboards were : " In the beginning , man created God " , " Good without God ?
Over one million Kiwis are " and " We are all atheists about most gods .
Some of us just go one God further " .
The ads also featured the phrase " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life " , borrowed from the British Atheist Bus Campaign which caused a storm when it launched last year .
The New Zealand campaign organisers were now asking for more donations from people who wanted to see the billboards spread to more cities .
About $ 10,000 of the group 's funds would go towards the billboards , Mr Fisher said last month .
In March , the group applied for legal representation from the Office of Human Rights Proceedings to pursue its discrimination case against the company .
NZ Bus said it declined to run the ads because the campaign had drawn a " significant reaction " from passengers and staff , with a number finding it distasteful or distressing .
" NZ Bus has the right to decline advertising that may , in its perception , be considered controversial or divisive , " spokeswoman Siobhan O'Donovan said .
Mr Fisher said the billboards would get the atheist message out into the public while the group awaited the office 's decision .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Babies born just 1 or 2 weeks before their 40 - week gestation due date are more likely to develop learning difficulties such as autism or dyslexia , according to a British study published on Tuesday .
The findings show that even babies born at 39 weeks -- the point at which many women who choose to have a Caesarean section delivery -- have an increased risk of a developing a learning disability compared with babies born a week later at 40 weeks .
Scientists in Scotland , analyzing the birth history of more than 400,000 schoolchildren , found that while babies born at 40 weeks have a 4 percent risk of learning difficulties , those born at 37 to 39 weeks of gestation have a 5.1 percent risk .
“ There was an increasing risk of special educational needs as the gestation date fell , so as deliveries got earlier , the risk went up , ” said Jill Pell , an expert in public health and health policy Glasgow University , who led the study .
“ Even being just a week early put the risk up . ”
It is already known that a baby born prematurely -- for example at 24 weeks of gestation -- is more likely to have learning difficulties .
But the risks for babies born in the 24 to 40 week range had not previously been studied .
According to the World Health Organization , more and more women worldwide are delivering by caesarean section and a “ significant proportion ” of these surgical procedures are performed without any clear medical need .
Around a third of babies are born between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation , either by caesarean section or natural vaginal delivery .
Rates of autism have also been rising , with worldwide prevalence estimated at between 1 to 2 people in every thousand , although experts say this may be partly due to better diagnosis .
Pell noted this rise but said it would be “ a leap too far ” to link her findings directly to rates of autism , since autism was only one of a range of learning difficulties considered .
Pell , whose study was published in the Public Library of Science Medicine journal , stressed that caesarean sections were not the only factor behind early - term births , since some women go into labor naturally before 40 weeks of gestation .
But she said doctors and women should consider the risks of learning difficulties when thinking about a caesarean .
“ It is now normal policy ( in caesarean section ) to deliver women a week early , ” she said in a telephone interview .
“ But if you make a decision ... for an elective pre-term delivery , then it has to be a balance , weighing up the risks and potential benefits .
“ What this study shows is that special education needs are another factor that need to be considered . ”
Children with special educational needs may have either a learning difficulty such as dyslexia or autism , or a physical difficulty such as deafness or poor vision .
Pell found that although the risk of educational difficulties was much higher in preterm than in early term babies , the absolute numbers of children with difficulties in the 37 to 39 week group were higher , because many more babies are born at this time than before 37 weeks .
In her study , early term births accounted for 5.5 percent of cases learning disabilities , while preterm deliveries accounted for only 3.6 percent of cases .
The US military has pressed criminal charges against a soldier suspected of leaking video of a US helicopter attack in Iraq to the website , WikiLeaks .
Army Spc Bradley
Manning is accused of transferring classified data on to his personal computer and transmitting it to an unauthorised third party .
Spc Manning allegedly handed over footage of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007 .
He was detained in Baghdad in June , two months after the video 's publication .
The army has yet to say what leaked information led to the charges , however the date of the operation cited in the charge sheet matches that of the helicopter incident - 12 July 2007 .
' Classified cables '
According to a US Army statement , Spc Manning was charged on Monday with eight violations of US criminal law and four violations of army regulations governing the handling of classified information and computers .
He is accused of downloading a classified video of a military operation in Iraq and transmitting it to an uncleared third party , in violation of a section of the Espionage Act , according to the charge sheet .

If the charges against Manning are true , he will be the Daniel Ellsberg of our times WikiLeaks tweet Who are Wikileaks ?
Spc Manning is also alleged to have abused access to a secret - level network to obtain more than 150,000 US state department cables , some of them classified .
More than 50 cables are said to have been passed to an unauthorised person .
If convicted of all charges , he could face a prison sentence of between 50 to 70 years , according to army spokesman Lt Col Eric Bloom .
Col Bloom told the BBC that the next step would be an Article 32 hearing , at which time an investigating officer will determine whether the case should go to court - martial .
In the meantime , Spc Manning was free to retain his own counsel and make telephone calls , he added .
It has yet to be decided if any court - martial would be open to the public .
Spc Manning is said to have confessed to leaking the video of the helicopter attack to WikiLeaks in a series of online chats with a former computer hacker , Adrian Lamo .
He allegedly also admitted handing over other items to WikiLeaks , including a classified army document assessing the threat level of the website , which promotes the leaking of information by whistleblowers .
WikiLeaks says it does not know whether Spc Manning was the source of the leak as it does not keep personal records of the people who approach it .
It also denies it has any diplomatic cables .
However , the charge sheet accuses Spc Manning of obtaining a classified cable titled " Reykjavik 13 " , which was published by WikiLeaks on 18 February .
The cable from the US embassy in Iceland describes meetings between its charge d'affaires Sam Watson , members of the Icelandic government and the British ambassador .
Apology
Following the army 's announcement that Spc Manning had been charged , WikiLeaks posted a message on Twitter .
I put the interest of many ahead of the interest of one Adrian Lamo Hacker reports ' Wikileaks source '
" If the charges against Manning are true , he will be the Daniel Ellsberg of our times , " it said , referring to the US military strategist who leaked 7,000 pages of top - secret documents in an effort to halt the Vietnam War .
Mr Lamo meanwhile told the BBC that he would like to apologise to the 22 - year - old .
" Not for doing what I did - which I believe was right - in that it protected US and coalition service men and women abroad , " he said .
" But what I am sorry for is that I was not a good friend to him . "
" I put the interest of many ahead of the interest of one . "
The video published by WikiLeaks in April shows an Apache helicopter opening fire on a group of about eight people , whom the pilots identify as armed insurgents .
After a voice on the transmission urges the pilots to " light 'em all up " , the individuals on the street are shot by the gunship 's cannon .
A few minutes later a van drives to the scene , and its occupants appear to start picking up a wounded person .
It , too , is fired upon .
Two children were among the casualties , along with a photographer working for the Reuters news agency and his assistant .
The US military initially said the helicopters had been engaged in combat operations against a hostile force .
I just wanted to thank you for putting these together for everyone .
I know many here would not have had the chance to see them otherwise .
I always have to laugh a little when I think about humanity .
We seem so weak , so ... disadvantaged compared to the finely tuned killing machines displayed here .
Then , it dawned on me .
Regardless of how smart , or stupid people view each other as a species , one truth remains constant .
Humans made it to the top because our brain makes up for our lack of physical strength .
That same brain that brought us here so quickly could , in my humble opinion , also remove us from this most coveted spot on the food chain .
Maybe that 's part of its brilliance , its design .
Maybe we are about to hit the cut - off point .

From the WSJ : Shopping - Center Malaise
Vacancies at shopping centers in the top 77 U.S. markets increased to 10.8 % in the first quarter ... according to Reis .
It is the highest vacancy rate since 1991 , when vacancies reached 11 % .
Vacancy rates at malls in the top 77 U.S. markets rose to 8.9 % in the January - to - March period ...
" The stress might be lessening and rent declines might be moderating , " said Reis director of research Victor Calanog .
" But we do n't see positive rent growth resuming until the middle of next year at the earliest , just because of the typical lag . "
This is up from 10.6 % in Q4 2009 and 9.5 % in Q1 2009 .
The 8.9 % is the highest since Reis began tracking regional malls in 2000 .
Lease rates fell for the seventh consecutive quarter .
" After the great feedback we received from last year ’s event we could n’t ’ really look any further than Global Event Management .
Yet again they surpassed themselves and we ’re looking forward to their proposition for next year . "
After some initial brouhaha the issue of China allowing its currency to become more market driven , the talks have subsided .
Anyways , Barry Eichengreen and Andrew Rose have written a nice paper looking at the impact .
China ’s announcement on Saturday , June 19th that it will abandon its currency peg to the dollar and henceforth manage the renminbi more flexibly against a basket of currencies will have implications for the world economy , but most of all it will have implications for China .
Assume for sake of argument that Beijing now allows the renminbi to appreciate .
Some warn that there could be a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth , with adverse effects on the export sector and financial markets .
They point to the appreciation of the yen in the 1970s and again in the 1980s , followed first by a sharp slowdown in Japanese growth and then a lost decade .
What impact should we expect this to have on the Chinese economy ?
Others say that these fears are overblown .
They note that the renminbi’s appreciation in 2005 - 8 had little visible impact on Chinese exports and growth .
The rebuttal here is that the currency ’s appreciation was so limited in duration and magnitude – it rose against the dollar by only 7 per cent a year and even that was halted after 12 quarters – that it is not possible to draw general conclusions from this experience .
Moreover , the backdrop to the 2005 episode was special : the world economy was booming , and the Chinese economy itself was in an exceptionally strong position .
This episode , it is objected , was sui generis .
So , in this paper the authors look at previous such episodes of currency appreciation and abandoning pegs .
What do the results show ?
We find little evidence of serious economic and financial damage as a result of exits up .
There is no increase in the incidence of banking and financial crises .
There is no evidence of significant stock market declines .
There is no evidence of a significant deterioration in the current account .
There is no evidence of a significant fall in the investment rate .
A variety of other economic and financial variables are similarly unaffected .
There is , however , weak evidence a deceleration in economic growth from relatively high levels .
The average annual growth rate falls by roughly a percentage point between the five years before and after the policy event .
This suggests that the preference of Chinese officials for moving gradually is well founded .
But , if they do , they need not worry about a crash .
What causes growth to decline ?
So we have something of a paradox .
Growth slows by a percentage point around the time of exits up but there is no other visible change to the economy .
Should the decline in the growth rate , which misses statistical significance ( just marginally ) at the 90 per cent confidence level be dismissed as a statistical anomaly ?
To get a better handle on this question , we look next at the rates of growth of the components of GDP .
Export growth slows significantly , from 9.7 per cent per annum in the five years preceding the exit to 6.4 per cent in the five years following ( the difference is significant at the 95 per cent confidence level ) ; this is an expected effect of currency appreciation .
But import growth slows by almost the same amount .
And as we saw above there is no visible change in the current account .
The rates of growth of both investment and government spending fall slightly following exits up , but neither change remotely approaches statistical significance at any reasonable confidence level .
The component of GDP that lies behind the slowdown in growth turns out to be household consumption .
The rate of growth of household consumption falls from 6.0 to 4.3 per cent per annum between the five years prior to and following exits up .
With the country exporting less , households consume fewer imports and domestically - produced goods alike .
One interpretation , again , is that this is a healthy adjustment that avoids overheating .
Another interpretation is that , had the authorities been prepared to support spending by increasing government consumption and by adopting measures , such as financial liberalization and the development of a social safety net , to promote the growth of private consumption , any slowdown could have been avoided .
So what are the suggestions for Chinese economy ?
What are the implications for Chinese economic policy and performance ?
The experience of other countries gives little reason to think that an exit up will have seriously adverse consequences for the economy .
But it points to the possibility of economic growth slowing at least marginally .
If the authorities wish to limit the risk of an excessive slowdown , they can maintain the level of public spending and redouble their efforts to foster the growth of private consumption .
If more domestic spending means more spending on , among other things , imported goods , this will represent a Chinese contribution to global rebalancing
Hmmm .
Very useful stuff .
The authors say they are not aware of any previous work on such an event .
Infact most research looks at abandoning pegged exchange rates but currency depreciates .
This has usually been the case in cases of currency crisis .
So , the event may not be unique but no studies have been done in the past on this event .
As exchange rate classification etc is difficult as well , it was a task to arrive at a dataset to analyse .

Want to know what ’s the most hilarious testament of the history ?
The last will of a rich man , mortgaged with his sense of humor .
Charles Vance Millar , a Canadian lawyer and a vocational joker , decided to share his huge fortune in a unique way .
A mansion divided between the three most faced lawyers of the country .
Stocks of a racetrack to give to various detractors of the horse races …
And , especially , the famous ‘ birth rate ’ contest proposed to the executor in the clause number 9 .
Will of Charles Vance Millar , 1926 .
Link
.
In a recession time , marked by the Great Depression late the 20s , Mister Charles Vance Millar decided to award with most part of his fortune the Toronto women who have more children over a period of ten years after his death .
The offer was , obviously , a bomb , and was focused to boost the birthrate in the worst crisis scenario .
The award was about one million dollar ( of that time ) and guaranteed lifetime maintenance for various generations .
“ This Will is necessarily uncommon and capricious because I have no dependents or near relations and no duty rests upon me to leave any property at my death and what I do leave is proof of my folly in gathering and retaining more than I required in my lifetime . ”
Will of Charles Vance Millar
Charles Vance Millar was n’t a common lawyer .
‘ Cum laude ’ graduated in the University of Toronto ; he stood out soon as an enthusiast student of the human behavior and the wicked limits of their fun .
Always joking , he blocked himself in living with each others , just to die without issue .
Everybody laughed with him but nobody could stand him , and he was aware of his funny life imprisonment .
Conditioned by his job , all of his jokes were based in the greed and the passion of the human being for money .
His personal motto was ‘ Every man has a price ’ , and was not strange meeting her hiding one dollar notes on the streets , just for watching the passerby ’s surprise faces .
He never improvised anything and his testament was a collection of tricks to avoid the Supreme Court of Canada canceling his eccentric last will for being against the public order .
The first laugh from beyond the grave was heard when the three lawyers noticed the legacy that Charles forced them to share .
One of the clauses pointed that , if one of them dies ( killed by one of their selves ) , the value of his part would go directly to the town ’s charity .
One stock of the beer factory O’Keefe , which was multi owned by Charles , was given to every protestant minister of the Orange order in Toronto .
We should point that the O’Keefe factory was in the management of catholic hands .
Seven prominent Methodist and soberness defenders ministers were going to receive a stock valuated in 700.000 dollars and sharing the management of the factory with the most catholic part of the enterprise .
Glup !
In the same way , three opponents of the games and horse races , moral supporters of the anti compulsive gambling community in Toronto , were going to receive stocks valuated in 25.000 dollars of the “ Ontario Jockey Club ” , a famous racetrack and bookmaker .
.
Clause number 9 . : The great stork derby
” [… ]
All the rest and residue of my property wheresoever situate I give , devise and bequeath unto my Executors and Trustees named below in Trust to convert into money as they deem advisable and invest all the money until the expiration of nine years from my death and then call in and convert it all into money and at the expiration of ten years from my death to give it and its accumulations to the Mother who has since my death given birth in Toronto to the greatest number of children as shown by the Registrations under the Vital Statistics Act .
If one of more mothers have equal highest number of registrations under the said Act to divide the said moneys and accumulations equally between them . ”
Will of Charles Vance Millar
A typical recession family .

.
The media named this outrageous contest “ The great stork derby ” and they followed the event with an increasing interest .
The contestants were identified by the newspapers , becoming celebrities very quickly .
The problems began soon , motivated by the deliberate loophole that Charles left : abortions , illegitimate children , premature death , etc …
The Supreme Court of Canada itself was forced to get into the game and answer all the doubts and problems .
Most of contestants were unemployed women with husbands without job , and , paradoxically , they had to be mortgaged for 10 years to go on with the “ kids - on - demand ” and their particular “ family planning ” .
The percentage of abortions and extramarital adventures of this crazy contest led a lot of contestants – especially the non finalists – to situations of extreme poverty and need .
On October 31st of 1936 , ten years since Charles Vance Millar ’s death , the contest finished having a tie as result .
Four women with nine children alive and “ validated ” by the Supreme Court : Anna Katherine Smith , Ellen Kathleen Nagle , Lucy Alice Timleck , e Isabel María MacClean received 125.000 dollars each one as reward .
A special mention was made by the Court to two finalist women that reached the quantity of ten kids , but not “ validated ” because they did it using the easy way of promiscuity and some abortions .
The court gave to Lillian Kenny y Pauline Mae Clarke 12.500 dollars , just for reaching the appeals round .
The last will of the great Charles Vance Millar was done .

SAN FRANCISCO / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Google
Inc plans to buy one of the Web ’s key providers of airline travel software for $ 700 million , potentially raising new antitrust concerns for the world ’s largest Internet search engine .
A camera used for Google street view is pictured at the CeBIT computer fair in Hanover March 2 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Christian Charisius
Google said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy privately - owned ITA Software , in a move that Google said would allow it to improve the way consumers find flight and fare information online .
“ What we ’re going to do is build new flight search tools that focus on end-users , ” Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt said in a conference call with analysts and members of the press on Thursday .
He said that Google had no plans to sell airline tickets to consumers and that Google planned to honor all existing agreements that ITA has with its partners .
The deal should allow Google to match innovations made by Microsoft Corp , whose recently re-launched Bing search engine has gained share by focusing on a handful of specific search categories like travel and shopping .
The deal , which was reported to be in the works for weeks , has unnerved travel industry players worried that Google could end up wielding too much influence in the sector .
ITA , which has roughly 500 employees , provides software that organizes flight information like fares and flight times .
The company is a major source of information about airfares to the aviation industry , used by airlines , travel agents and other sites including AMR Corp ’s American Airlines , Continental Airlines , Hotwire , Kayak , Orbitz and Microsoft ’s Bing .
Google beat out reported bidders Expedia , Kayak.com and Travelport .
On a conference call on Thursday , Google executives called the deal “ pro-competitive ” and “ pro-consumer ” but said it expects that U.S. regulators will examine the deal ’s implications closely .
“ I would expect that it would be a significant review , ” said Schmidt .
He declined to estimate when the deal would close .
The ITA deal comes shortly after Google closed its $ 750 million acquisition of mobile advertising firm AdMob .
That deal was held up for several months by regulators , but ultimately approved when the Federal Trade Commission concluded that Apple Inc ’s nascent mobile ad business would keep the market competitive .
Antitrust lawyers said they expected the Google - ITA deal to be scrutinized by regulators , but ultimately approved .
“ I would be surprised if this transaction were blocked , ” said attorney Richard Brosnick , an antitrust expert with Butzel Long .
He said that the argument against the deal is not that it would make Google dominant in the field , but that Google could use its power to hurt other online travel companies like Expedia and Orbitz .
Brosnick said he expected the government to enforce certain conditions before approving the deal , such as requiring that Google / ITA continue to deal with Orbitz and others on even terms .
Google executives said on Friday that it was too soon to say exactly how the company would incorporate ITA into its search service , or how it might make money from ITA ’s flight information .
Caris & Company analyst Sandeep Aggarwal said that travel - related searches currently accounted for 10 to 12 percent of Google ’s revenue , which totaled almost $ 24 billion in 2009 .
But he said that Microsoft ’s advances in its online travel search service , including its 2008 acquisition of the FareCast travel information service , had forced Google to bolster its own travel capabilities .
“ Google ’s number one competitor has been successful by penetrating some of the verticals , and travel is one of them , ” said Aggarwal .
“ This Google ITA deal is motivated by both offensive and defensive reasons , ” he said .
Google shares , which slid 1.2 percent on Thursday to $ 439.49 in a weak market , were unchanged in after - hours trade at $ 439.49 .
When he arrived in Uganda in November 2005 , Melburnian Simon Turner had only £ 300 in his pocket and a lead about investing in the export of honey .
Scroll forward five years and these days the 36 - year - old is the managing director of a small Kampala - based business , Malaika Honey , which sells locally produced honey into the Ugandan market and exports an associated by - product , propolis , to Australia where it 's sold in health food shops as a multi- purpose curative .
Mr Turner , a graphic designer who has worked in advertising and web design in Australia , the UK and Germany , and his business partner and brother - in - law Glenn Harris , a London - based criminal law barrister , first heard of an investment opportunity in Uganda 's honey market around 2005 .
“ They said that the quality of the honey in Uganda was one of the best in the world and had n't really been tapped by the rest of the world … ” recalled Mr Harris , 39 .
“ Because the bees feed on the acacia trees , it has a distinct sort of flavour . ”
He said that at the time , the market was looking for suppliers after impurities were found in honey produced in China , then the world 's major player .

A team of French researchers has found that women who listen to music with romantic lyrics are more likely to agree to date a man who asks them out .
The study , published this month in the journal Psychology of Music , involved 87 undergraduate female students who told researchers they were single .
The women sat alone in a waiting room while one of two French songs played - one which had romantic lyrics , the other which had neutral lyrics .
After three minutes of listening to the music , each woman was invited to sit with a 20 - year - old man , who other young women had judged as having " average " physical attractiveness .
The pair then compared two varieties of biscuit .
Following the discussion , the man asked the woman for her phone number and invited her out for a drink .
" My name is Antoine , as you know , I think you are very nice and I was wondering if you would give me your phone number , " the man said to each woman .
" I 'll phone you later and we can have a drink together somewhere next week . "
He then waited 10 seconds and gazed and smiled at the woman .
Of the women who had been listening to romantic lyrics , 52.2 per cent provided the man with their phone number .
But only 27.9 per cent of women who had been listening to the neutral lyrics agreed to his request .
The psychologists say other studies have shown background music can affect pro-social and consumer behaviour , but their study is the first to link it to " more intimate affects " .
They say further research need to be done as the experiment only examined the effects of one romantic song .

An Irish boy , then aged five , who was wrongly accused of stealing a bag of chips has won a € 7500 ( $ 11,000 ) payout from a supermarket chain , his lawyer said .
Tadhg Mooney , of Balbriggan , north of Dublin , had just finished shopping with his mother Rachel at their local Lidl store in June last year when a cashier came after him , taking him by the hand and accusing him of stealing .
Finding him crying inside the store , his mother presented a receipt showing she had paid for the bag , their lawyer Dermot McNamara said .
But the shop manager failed to take her concerns seriously , causing her to take legal proceedings against the firm for slander , for false imprisonment , assault and negligence .
" We managed to settle it over negotiations lasting for a month or two and they eventually gave an offer of € 7500 , " McNamara said .
The settlement was approved at Ireland 's Circuit Civil Court on Tuesday and the money will be set aside for the boy , now aged six , to use when he is older .
Lidl Ireland declined to comment on the case .

The Hills ended its sixth and final season last night with a clever scene that acknowledged how scripted , fake , and overly produced it has become .
Kristin Cavallari and Brody Jenner say a quasi-emotional goodbye , and as Brody watches her car drive away , all set to a montage featuring a remixed version of the show ’s theme song .
Then came the reveal : the background behind him slid away , revealed to be just an image of the Hollywood sign .
He was standing between soundstages , and the camera pulled back to reveal that her car stopped a few feet away , and there are lights and cameras and reflectors everywhere .
They hug , the crew high - fives , and anyone who did n’t think it was fake before suddenly has their mind blown .
( Gawker has video of the final moments . )
It as actually really well - done , because the earlier part of their goodbye scene was filmed on a real street with traffic going by , and there was footage of her car driving a significant distance .
So in a big meta - joke , they faked the real ( but still fake ) ending .
And if there ’s any doubt that there was even the slightest hint of reality , Kristin told People yesterday that the relationship is n’t real : “ â€ œNothing you see on TV is real .
Fans need to understand it ’s all entertainment .
It ’s all in fun .
I would never put my close friends or a real relationship on a show . ”
A mini-documentary .
I need to start off by saying that I did n’t do a mini-documentary about the cherry harvest process because I felt the world had a need for such information .
I did it as an exercise , as practice using my video camera and Final Cut Pro .
I wanted to see if I had the ability to put together a documentary .
This 5 - minute video is the result .
This was my second summer experiencing the harvest process at one of the orchards I dry .
The Schroeders are great people , friendly and a pleasure to work with .
I dried their orchard four times this year .
Being present for part of the harvest gave me an opportunity to see whether the work I ’d done made a difference .
It did .
The Schroeders were kind enough to let me walk the orchard and packing shed area with my Sony Handycam for a total of about 8 hours over two days .
I also stopped in around sunset one evening to take some of the establishing shots with the soft “ golden hour ” light .
They and their workers explained the process to me .
I shot a total of about an hour of video footage .
That that was barely enough .
I still wish I ’d gotten better shots of some parts of the process .
I found the cherry harvest fascinating — and I think you might , too .
We ’re all spoiled — we go into the supermarket in the summertime and find cherries waiting in the produce section , already bagged and ready to take home .
But how many of us consider how the cherries get from the tree to the supermarket ?
It ’s a complex process that requires hundreds of people and specialized equipment .
This video shows part of the story , following the cherries from the trees in one orchard as they ’re picked , gathered , chilled , and packed into a refrigerator truck .
Take a moment to see for yourself :
Done ?
Not bad for a first serious effort .
From this point , the cherries go to the processing plant in Wenatchee , WA .
They ’re run through more cold water and lots of custom equipment before they ’re picked through by several lines of people who toss out the bad ones .
Then they ’re sorted by size , run through more clean water , and eventually bagged and boxed up by even more people for shipment .
I was fortunate enough to get a tour of that facility ( and five more pounds of fresh cherries ) a few days after I shot the video for this one .
I may do a video of that facility and its process next year .
The amazing part of all this : the cherries are normally ready to ship to stores the same day they are picked .
More amazing stuff : the cherries I saw at the packing facility were headed for Korea and would be there within 18 hours of my tour .
Whoa .
The point of all this is that there ’s a lot that goes into getting fresh food into stores .
Cherries are unlike many fruits — they have a very short shelf life .
With proper care , they might last a week .
That ’s why everything is rushed and why so much effort is put into keeping them cool as soon as they ’re picked .
I hope you enjoyed this .
Comments are welcome .
No charge on G20 man death ' profoundly unsatisfactory ' Published duration 26 July 2010
image caption Mr Grieve said he was " unhappy " over the lack of clarity in the case
The Attorney General has said it was " profoundly unsatisfactory " that " a conflict of evidence " led to no charges over Ian Tomlinson 's death .
Dominic Grieve said he understood the public 's " dismay " over the decision not to charge the officer seen pushing Mr Tomlinson before his death last April .
But he added that the Crown Prosecution Service had acted with " propriety " .
Mr Tomlinson died after being pushed to the ground by the police officer during the G20 protests in the City of London .
The 47 - year - old newspaper vendor was not an activist but was walking home in April 2009 when he was shoved in the Royal Exchange .
He walked away but collapsed 100 metres away in Cornhill and died .
Last week the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said there was no realistic prospect of conviction because pathologists - who conducted three post - mortem examinations - could not agree on how he died .
Mr Tomlinson 's son Paul King described the decision as " outrageous " .
Responding to an emergency question in the Commons , Mr Grieve said the CPS and the IPCC had approached the case on the basis that there may be evidence to justify a charge of manslaughter , but conflicting evidence had jeopardised the case .
The CPS had also considered a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm .
Mr Grieve said : " There is something profoundly unsatisfactory about a conflict of evidence arising on facts in matters of this kind .
" Anyone , as I said , who saw the video of what happened must be seized with very serious concern about the matter .
" It 's a view I entirely endorse and therefore for the same reason I am extremely unhappy , as I 'm sure everybody in this house is , that we should be in the position that we are in today with such a complete lack of clarity in the matter .
" But there may well be lessons to be learnt . "
He added : " I have seen nothing to make me doubt the seriousness and propriety of the decision - making process in this case . "
' Muddy evidential waters '
Labour 's Emily Thornberry , MP for Islington South and Finsbury , said : " We have all seen the film .
The man [ Mr Tomlinson ] was clearly assaulted . "
Shadow justice minister Maria Eagle questioned why the CPS had based its decision on " the divergence of medical opinion " .
She said : " The public will find it difficult to understand how the opinion of a doctor facing 26 charges of misconduct before the General Medical Council can in effect muddy the evidential waters in this very serious case to such an extent that a prosecution cannot proceed . "
Dr Freddy Patel , the first pathologist , is currently under investigation for alleged misconduct over four unrelated post - mortem examinations .
Albert was the husband and consort of Queen Victoria and a significant influence on his wife .
She never recovered from his premature death .
Albert Francis Charles Augustus Emmanuel of Saxe - Coburg - Gotha was born on 26 August 1819 at Schloss Rosenau , in Bavaria , the younger son of the duke of Saxe - Coburg - Gotha .
When he was seven , his father divorced his mother on grounds of adultery , and she was sent to live in Switzerland and forbidden to see her children .
Albert was educated at Bonn University .
In 1840 , he married his cousin , Queen Victoria .
The marriage was unpopular in some quarters , and parliament resisted granting Albert what his wife regarded as a suitable allowance .
Albert 's role as advisor to his wife came into full force after the death of Lord Melbourne , the prime minister , who had exerted a strong paternal influence over Victoria , and Albert began to act as the queen 's private secretary .
He encouraged in his wife a greater interest in social welfare and invited Lord Shaftesbury , the driving force behind successive factory acts , to Buckingham Palace to discuss the matter of child labour .
His constitutional position was a difficult one , and although he exercised his influence with tact and intelligence , he never enjoyed great public popularity during Victoria 's reign .
It was n't until 1857 that he was formally recognised by the nation and awarded the title ' prince consort ' .
Albert took an active interest in the arts , science , trade and industry .
He masterminded the Great Exhibition of 1851 , with a view to celebrating the great advances of the British industrial age and the expansion of the empire .
He used the profits to help to establish the South Kensington museums complex in London .
In the autumn of 1861 , Albert intervened in a diplomatic row between Britain and the United States and his influence probably helped to avert war between the two countries .
When he died suddenly of typhoid on 14 December , Victoria was overwhelmed by grief and remained in mourning until the end of her life .
She commissioned a number of monuments in his honour , including the Royal Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens completed in 1876 .
Albert and Victoria had nine children , most of whom married into the other royal houses of Europe .

CNN on Wednesday removed its senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs , Octavia Nasr , from her job after she published a Twitter message saying that she respected the Shiite cleric the Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah , who died on Sunday .
Ms. Nasr left her CNN office in Atlanta on Wednesday .
Parisa Khosravi , the senior vice president for CNN International Newsgathering , said in an internal memorandum that she “ had a conversation ” with Ms. Nasr on Wednesday morning and that “ we have decided that she will be leaving the company . ”
Ms. Nasr , a 20 - year veteran of CNN , wrote on Twitter after the cleric died on Sunday , “ Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah …
One of Hezbollah ’s giants I respect a lot . ”
Ayatollah Fadlallah routinely denounced Israel and the United States , and supported suicide bombings against Israeli civilians .
Ayatollah Fadlallah ’s writings and preachings inspired the Dawa Party of Iraq and a generation of militants , including the founders of Hezbollah , The New York Times reported on Sunday .
Some supporters of Israel seized on the Twitter posting almost immediately .
A Web site called Honest Reporting that says it is “ dedicated to defending Israel against prejudice in the media ” asked , “ Is Nasr a Hezbollah sympathizer ?
This is disturbing enough given that the group is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and is committed to the destruction of Israel .
“ And which of Fadlallah ’s individual views does Nasr admire ? ”
CNN officials became aware of Ms. Nasr ’s message on Monday , and a spokesman said Tuesday that it was an “ error of judgment ” on her part .
“ CNN regrets any offense her Twitter message caused .
It did not meet CNN ’s editorial standards .
This is a serious matter and will be dealt with accordingly , ” the spokesman said .
Ms. Nasr apparently deleted the post at some point .
In a follow - up blog post on Tuesday evening , Ms. Nasr said she was sorry about the message “ because it conveyed that I supported Fadlallah ’s life ’s work .
That ’s not the case at all . ”
She said she used the words “ respect ” and “ sad ” because “ to me , as a Middle Eastern woman , Fadlallah took a contrarian and pioneering stand among Shia clerics on woman ’s rights .
He called for the abolition of the tribal system of ‘ honor killing . ’
He called the practice primitive and nonproductive .
He warned Muslim men that abuse of women was against Islam . ”
She continued , “ This does not mean I respected him for what else he did or said .
Far from it . ”
Her explanation was apparently not sufficient for her CNN bosses .
Ms. Khosravi wrote in the memorandum , “ At this point , we believe that her credibility in her position as senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs has been compromised going forward . ”
Her exit was first reported by the Web site Mediaite .
Despite her senior editor title , Ms. Nasr did not run CNN ’s Middle East coverage , a network spokesman said .
She reported and provided analysis about the region for CNN / U.S. , CNN International and CNN.com .
She was also , as her CNN.com biography put it , a “ leader in integrating social media with newsgathering and reporting . ”
Thirteen years ago , a biomedical engineer in Orange County had a religious awakening and began tinkering with plastic lawn chairs and bicycle wheels in his garage .
Don Schoendorfer , who has a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , was in search of the perfect wheelchair for the poor in the developing world — a vehicle that would be light , durable and , above all , cheap .
His peers thought he had gone off the deep end .
Even his wife , although supportive , soon tired of his creations cluttering the garage of their Santa Ana home .
But Schoendorfer kept plugging away , and his modest dream of building a better wheelchair became a massive undertaking .
Now he heads the Free Wheelchair Mission , a faith - based nonprofit headquartered in Irvine that says it has given away nearly 500,000 wheelchairs in 77 developing nations .
The manufacturing center long ago moved from Schoendorfer ’s garage to two factories in China where the wheelchair components are produced at a cost of about $ 60 each .
The organization has grown from a volunteer effort to a nonprofit with a staff of 18 and a $ 6.5 - million budget .
The chairs have been shipped to India , Peru and post - earthquake Haiti , among other countries .
Schoendorfer , 61 , said he has learned to relax and trust in God .
“ I used to live by goals , I used to live by plans , and very elaborate goals and backup plans , ” he said .
“ Now I feel like I ’m more reacting and keeping an open mind and keeping a strong faith . ”
The genesis of the wheelchair project came in 1977 when Schoendorfer made a four - day trip to Morocco with his wife , Laurie .
They saw a beggar who had lost the use of her legs dragging herself across a dirt road while passersby ignored her .
The image stuck with Schoendorfer , but it was n’t until 20 years later that he figured out how he might help .
In the meantime , he had moved from Boston to Orange County , “ which is where you go when you want to make a lot of money , ” he said .
He believed in God , but religion was not part of his daily life .
Then his oldest daughter developed bulimia , and the three - year struggle brought the family back to its Christian faith .
Soon afterward , in 1997 , a sermon by Pastor Kenton Beshore at Mariners Church in Irvine gave Schoendorfer a kick start .
The sermon was based on a biblical parable about a rich man who spends his life building bigger grain silos but dies before he can enjoy the wealth he has stored .
The story struck a nerve with Schoendorfer .
“ You start to feel like there ’s a reason for you being here , and it could be a little deeper than getting a job and having a home and raising a family , ” he said .
After casting around for a mission , Schoendorfer remembered the beggar in Morocco .
Two years and many hours of research and tinkering later , he had a working prototype for a low - cost wheelchair .
He had settled on bicycle tires and light resin lawn chairs as his base materials because they were the cheapest to produce .
He demonstrated the first model to Pastor Skip Lanfried in the Mariners Church parking lot .
Lanfried , who would become one of the nonprofit ’s founding board members , loved the project .
By 2001 , after getting up before dawn many days to work in the garage before heading to the office , Schoendorfer had a stockpile of 100 chairs .
He gave his first one to a family in a small agricultural village in India whose young son had cerebral palsy .
When he returned to the United States , he found that the company he worked for was going bankrupt .
“ It was like a two - by - four over the head .
If I did n’t get it from this experience , from India , it was like God saying , ‘ What else do I need to do to show you this is important ? ’ ” he said .
Soon after , the Free Wheelchair Mission had a board of directors and had become a “ full - time and then some ” endeavor for Schoendorfer , although it would be several years before it paid a salary .
The chair has evolved since the first prototype .
This year , Free Wheelchair Mission will ship a new model engineered for people who need full body support .
It aims to give away a total of 20 million chairs .
The nonprofit remains focused on its Christian mission , supported largely by faith - based groups , and it is working with Christian distribution partners overseas .
But Schoendorfer said the primary goal is to make sure the chairs get to people who need them .
“ We ’re not an evangelical organization , because we do n’t want anyone to think there ’s a requirement to get a wheelchair , ” he said .
“ There are no strings attached . ”
Everyone involved in the project has a favorite story .
Lanfried ’s is about a 5 - year - old boy in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The boy lived in an orphanage for disabled children , where he spent most of his time lying on the floor except for trips to the bathroom .
A week after giving the boy his new chair , Lanfried was heading to the airport when he caught a glimpse of something familiar on the side of the street .
It was a wheelchair .
The little boy was in it , being pushed by an older boy , who was running .
The boys were laughing .

Create a Sliding Navigation Menu in CSS3 and jQuery 4 Easy Steps
There are many ways to create a navigation menu for the Web .
One of the most popular navigation menus is the accordion look drop - down navigation that slides up and down , showing its sub -menus when toggled .
In this tutorial , we ’re going to build a sliding navigation menu using CSS3 , along with some jQuery codes to manage the sliding animation .
Let ’s get started .
The Final Output
[ demo source = ” https://1stwebdesigner.com/demos/accordion_nav.zip” demo= ” https://1stwebdesigner.com/demos/accordion_nav_/”]
Using Font Awesome ( Web Icons )
For this tutorial , instead of using ordinary .png icons for our sliding navigation , we will be using Font Awesome .
There are a lot of advantages in using web fonts or web icons :
There are variety of icons to choose from
You can save money ; you do n’t need to pay for the icons
You can save time ; you quickly use CSS to incorporate them in your design
Faster load time – Web fonts / icons automatically keep up with the new versions of web browsers
Web fonts / icons are SEO - friendly
There are two ways on how to use Font Awesome in our design project .
The first one is by using BootstrapCDN link to your HTML markup and the second one is by downloading the Font Awesome files from the Font Awesome website and then use the Default CSS link to your HTML Markup .
To learn more about this , you can check the Font Awesome getting started page .
For this tutorial , I will be using the BootstrapCDN link to access the Font Awesome web fonts / icons .
The Markup
On our HTML file , we will add first the HTML5 doctype and series of links on our head section .
This will include our link to the CSS file , BootstrapCDN link and our jQuery library file .
<! DOCTYPE html > < html lang= " en " > < head > < title > Create a Sliding Navigation using CSS3 and Jquery </ title > < link rel=" stylesheet " href="css/style.css " /> < link href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.0.3/css/font-awesome.css " rel=" stylesheet " > < script type =" text / javascript " src="js/jquery.js " ></ script > </head >
The HTML structure for the menu will be an unordered list where the parent menu element is formatted in an H3 tag .
The H3 tag consists of an icon menu span wrapped in a div tag .
The parent menu element will have a plus (+ ) or a minus ( -) sign icon ( when toggled ) if it has sub - menu elements using Font Awesome web fonts / icons .
Notice that Font Awesome used the icon ( i ) tag to show its icons .
You can check here the Font Awesome code class database along with its icons .
< ul id =" toggle " > < li > < div class= " active " > < span class =" menu-icons home " >< i class= " menu-icons fa fa-home " ></i> </ span > < h3>HOME </h3 > </div> </li > < li > < div >< span class=" menu-icons about " > < i class= " fa fa-user " ></i > </ span > < h3 >ABOUT US </ h3 > < span class = " the - btn " >< i class= " fa fa-plus " ></i></span> < div class= " clear " ></div > </div> < ul > < li > < a href= " # " > OUR TEAM </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > OUR SERVICES </a></li> </ul > </li > < li > < div >< span class=" menu-icons portfolio " >< i class= " fa fa-briefcase " ></i> </ span > <h3 >PORTFOLIO </h3 > < span class = " the - btn " >< i class= " fa fa-plus " ></i></span> </div> < ul > < li > < a href= " # " > WEB DESIGN </ a> </ li > < li >< a href= " # " >
GRAPHIC DESIGN </a> </li > </ul > </li > < li > < div > < span class=" menu-icons contact " >< i class= " fa fa-envelope " ></i> </ span > <h3>CONTACT</h3 > </div > </li > </ul >
So by this time , if you will check this on your web browser , you will get the same output like the image below .
The CSS
The style for this tutorial consists of displaying the parent element block , and hiding the sub-menus of the parent menus , the background color , menu icons and the plus and minus sign icons .
For this part , we styled the parent menus , giving them width and background colors together with hover and active states and styled the H3 tag , which is the parent menu title .
body { width : 100 % ; background : # fff ; } #toggle { width : 240 px ; list - style : none ; margin : 170 px auto ; } # toggle div:hover { background : # f3b784 ; } #toggle div.active { background : # f3b784 ; } # toggle div { background - color : # f58220 ; cursor : pointer ; display : block ; margin : 1 px ; } # toggle h3 { font - size : 14 px ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; font - family : Tahoma ; color : # fff ; line - height : 41 px ; font - weight : normal ; text - shadow : 1px 1px 0px #adadad ; filter : dropshadow ( color=#adadad , offx=1 , offy =1 ) ; } .clear { clear : both ; display : block ; overflow : hidden ; visibility : hidden ; }
So by this time , if you will check this on your web browser , you will get the same output like the image below .
Next , we will put the menu icons on the left and the plus sign icon on right .
span.menu-icons { font - size : 26 px ; height : 20 px ; width : 22 px ; float : left ; margin : 6 px 12 px 10 px 12 px ; color : # fff ; } span .
the - btn { float : right ; font - size : 26 px ; height : 30 px ; width : 43 px ; margin - top : - 34 px ; margin - right : - 10 px ; padding : 0 ; color : # fff ; }
It is expected right now that you ’ll have the same look like the image below .
Lastly , we will be putting styles on sub-menus but , by default , we will hide them and then animate them using jQuery later on .
# toggle ul { list - style : none ; display : none ; background - color : # f3b784 ; color : fff ; } #toggle ul li { line - height : 41 px ; color : # fff ; list - style : circle ; width : 240 px ; padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; } #toggle a { text - decoration : none ; color : # fff ; font - family : Tahoma ; font - size : 14 px ; text - shadow : 1px 1px 0px #adadad ; filter : dropshadow ( color=#adadad , offx=1 , offy =1 ) ; } #toggle a : hover { color : # f58220 ; }
You will get the same output like the image below .
The jQuery Sliding Effect
When the entire block element is displaying properly , we need to create the JavaScript effect .
In my jQuery code , I created a variable to take a reference of the current menu icon by using the code : $ currIcon= $ ( this ) .find ( “ span.the - btn > i ” )
Then , I change all the icons back in the compressed state ( the plus icon ) .
Next , using toggleClass , I switch plus / minus icons on the previously stored element $ currIcon .
$ ( " #toggle > li > div " ) .click ( function ( ) { if ( false == $ ( this ) . next ( ) .is ( ' : visible ' ) ) { $ ( ' # toggle ul ' ) .slideUp( ) ; } var $ currIcon= $ ( this ) .find ( " span.the - btn > i " ) $ (" span.the-btn > i " ) .not( $currIcon ) .addClass (' fa-plus ').removeClass (' fa- minus ' ) ; $ currIcon.toggleClass ( ' fa - minus fa-plus ' ) ; $ ( this ) .next ( ) .slideToggle ( ) ; $ ( " #toggle > li > div " ).removeClass ( " active " ) ; $ ( this ) .addClass ( ' active ' ) ; } ) ;
Final Thoughts
This tutorial offers web developers and designers a basic relatively simple understanding how to create a sliding menu navigation .
There are a lot of styles for a navigation menu out there but this one gives you a foundation on how this sliding effect will bring magic to your CSS .
You are free to play around and customize if on your own liking and design .

Creating Top , Left , Right and Bottom Position Tooltips
The HTML
Begin by creating simple markups for the hyperlinks .
You need a span element to utilize the content of the tooltip .
Also , put a class for each hyperlinks and style them later .
< a class=" top_tooltip " href= " " > TOP POSITION < span > This is a top position tooltip !</ span></a> < a class=" left_tooltip " href= " " > LEFT POSITION < span > This is a left position tooltip !</ span></a> < a class=" right_tooltip " href= " " >
RIGHT POSITION < span > This is a right position tooltip !</ span></a> < a class=" bottom_tooltip " href= " " >
BOTTOM POSITION < span > This is a bottom position tooltip !</ span></a>
The CSS
Now that the markup is ready , apply some style to the anchor tag classes .
a.top_tooltip,a.left_tooltip,a.right_tooltip,a.bottom_tooltip { display : inline ; position : relative ; }
After displaying the tooltips classes as inline link and giving it a position relative , add some styles now for the span elements by giving it a rounded box for the tooltip body .
Remember to manipulate the position using margins and position properties to push them to the right positions .
/* TOP TOOLTIP

bottom_tooltip span { visibility : visible ; opacity : 0.8 ; top : 30 px ; left : 50 % ; margin - left : - 76 px ; z-index : 999 ; }
Using the : hover selector , make the tooltips visible .
Position them respectively on mouse - over state .
The : after selector will insert the contents after the selected element .
Changing the Color of Tooltips
Now that you now know how to create a tooltips , you can change the color of each tooltips .
Changing the colors is not really that hard .
First , you need to go to the span element ’s style and change the background to the preferred color .
a.bottom_tooltip_red span { background : # cf1c1 c ; }
Next , you also need to change the border color of the position of the tooltip under : after selector styles .
In the example below , the bottom position tooltip will be changed .
First , you need to change the border - bottom color to your preferred color , similar to the color used above .
a.bottom_tooltip_red span : after { border - bottom : 8 px solid # cf1c1 c ; border - right : 8 px solid transparent ; border - left : 8 px solid transparent ; }
Adding Animation Effects to Tooltips
With the new CSS3 features , you can add some cool effects to the tooltips .
For this part of the tutorial , you will learn how you can add some plain fading effects and a sliding effect .
To create plain fading effects , you need to manipulate the opacity of the span element on its normal state and mouse - over state using the transition property .
Add the code below to the tooltips .
a.left_tooltip_fading span { transition : opacity 1s ease - in - out ; - moz - transition : opacity 1s ease - in - out ; - webkit - transition : opacity 1s ease - in - out ; opacity : 0 ; } a:hover.left_tooltip_fading span { opacity : 1 ; }
Notice that ease - in - out as the transition - timing - function was used to create a smooth fading in and out effect .
Now to create a bouncing effect , you need to add translated3d value and a smooth transition on its mouse - over state .
This will add a nice sliding effect to the toolkit appearance .
Add the following code to the tooltips span element .
a:hover.bottom_tooltip_sliding span { - webkit - transform : translate3d ( 0,0,0 ) ; - moz - transform : translate3d ( 0,0,0 ) ; transform : translate3d ( 0,0,0 ) ; - webkit - transition : .3s ease ; - moz - transition : .3s ease ; transition : .3s ease ; }
Displaying Images to the tooltip
There is really nothing special in adding images on tooltips .
You just need to put the image link and give it the preferred height and width .
If you prefer to put a text on it , then , you can customize the style of the class for that specific tooltip .
As an example , see the markup below .
< a class=" images_tooltip " href= " " > IMAGES < span >< img height = " 100 " src=" img / cat.jpg " width = " 70 " ></ span></a>
Final Words
All done !
You just made an awesome custom tooltips using HTML and CSS3 .
Although these tooltips were made manually , there are also other ways to do it like by using a CSS library like Hint.css or using a jQuery plugin like tooltipser.js .

How to Create Anchor Tooltips Custom Shortcode in Minutes !
Would n’t be great if you can also integrate tooltips on your WordPress site ?
Great thing there is a solution for that : WordPress shortcode .
Shortcodes are WordPress - specific code that lets you do nifty things with very little effort .
By just inserting something inside square brackets , it will replace that content with some other content and usually being driven by a series of PHP functions .
Note :
If you want to understand in - depth understanding about shortcodes , you might want to check this tutorial regarding the Theme Options Shortcodes .
Resources You Need to Complete This Tutorial
WordPress Installation Version 2.5 or higher
Knowledge about PHP and WordPress Codex
Time and patience
Shortcodes Variation
Shortcodes comes with two variations .
Additionally , shortcodes can be created with or without attributes .
Shortcode usually comes with this simplest version :
[ tooltip ]
The Shortcode API makes it easy to create shortcodes that support attributes like this :
[ tooltip class =" top_tooltip " title = " This is a tooltip ! " ]
Tooltip Text [ / tooltip ]
There are two steps involved in creating a shortcode
1. Building the Primary Handler Function
2. WordPress Hook for the Handler Function
Regardless of how dynamic or complicated your shortcode is , these steps are the foundation .
Building the Text Tooltip
STEP 1 – Creating the Shortcode file
You can place your shortcode snippets to plugins folder ( on your theme directory ) and then activate .
But take note that it is commonly added on the functions .
php file .
However , for this tutorial , let ’s create an additional file to keep the code clean without affecting the theme ’s built in functions .
Go ahead and create shortcode .
php file on your theme ’s root directory .
STEP 2 – Building the Primary Handler Function
For this part of the tutorial , add the primary functions .
Since tooltips can also contain images aside from just pure text , create two functions namely : tooltip and tooltip_image .
function tooltip ( ) {
// Do something here } function tooltip_image ( ) {
// Do something here }
STEP 3 – Adding Attributes and Returning the Result
One of the great things about shortcode is that handlers are broadly similar to WordPress filters : they accept parameters ( attributes ) and return a result ( the shortcode output ) .
There are three parameters that can be passed in to the shortcode callback function and they are the following :
$ atts – an associative array of attributes , or an empty string if no attributes are given
– an associative array of attributes , or an empty string if no attributes are given $ content – the enclosed content ( if the shortcode is used in its enclosing form )
– the enclosed content ( if the shortcode is used in its enclosing form ) $ tag – the shortcode tag , useful for shared callback functions
For this tutorial , you ’re going to use the $atts and $ content attribute to display your data .
Basically the $ atts will contain an array for your class , title and links and the content will refer to the item or text that these shortcodes will be wrap .
// Text Tooltip function tooltip ( $ atts , $ content = '' ) { $ atts = shortcode_atts ( array ( ' class ' => '' , ' title ' => '' ) , $ atts ) ; } //Image Tooltip function tooltip_image ( $ atts , $ content = '' ) { $ atts = shortcode_atts ( array ( ' class ' => '' , ' src ' => '' ) , $ atts ) ; }
Next , return your result using a variable $ html , which will contain the content format .
// Text tooltip function tooltip ( $ atts , $ content = '' ) { $ atts = shortcode_atts ( array ( ' class ' => '' , ' title ' => '' ) , $ atts ) ; $ html = ' < a class= " ' . $ atts [ ' class ' ] .' " title= " '. $ atts [ ' title ' ] . '" href= " # " >' . $ content . ' < span > ' .$ atts [ ' title ' ] . '</ span > </a>' ; return $ html ; } // Image Tooltip function tooltip_image ( $ atts , $ content = '' ) { $ atts = shortcode_atts ( array ( ' class ' => '' , ' src ' => '' ) , $ atts ) ; $ html = ' < a class= " ' . $ atts [ ' class ' ] . '" src= " '.$ atts [ ' src ' ] . ' " href= " # " >' . $ content . ' < span > < image src= " '.$ atts [ ' src ' ] . ' " width = " 100 " height = " 70 " /> </ span > </a >' ; return $ html ; }
STEP 4 – WordPressHook for the Handler Function
In order to execute the primary functions , you will tie it to WordPress ’ initialization action .
The name of the function will be the same to the name of the hook Shortcodes but feel free to change it to your preferred name .
// Text tooltip function tooltip ( $ atts , $ content = '' ) { $ atts = shortcode_atts ( array ( ' class ' => '' , ' title ' => '' ) , $ atts ) ; $ html = ' < a class= " ' . $ atts [ ' class ' ] .' " title= " '. $ atts [ ' title ' ] . '" href= " # " >' . $ content . ' < span > ' .$ atts [ ' title ' ] . '</ span > </a>' ; return $ html ; } add_shortcode ( ' tooltip ' , ' tooltip ' ) ; // Image Tooltip function tooltip_image ( $ atts , $ content = '' ) { $ atts = shortcode_atts ( array ( ' class ' => '' , ' src ' => '' ) , $ atts ) ; $ html = ' < a class= " ' . $ atts [ ' class ' ] . '" src= " '.$ atts [ ' src ' ] . ' " href= " # " >' . $ content . ' < span > < image src= " '.$ atts [ ' src ' ] . ' " width = " 100 " height = " 70 " /> </ span > </a>' ; return $ html ; } add_shortcode ( ' tooltip_image ' , ' tooltip_image ' ) ;
STEP 5 – Testing the Shortcode
Now , with the CSS added from the previous tutorial regarding the CSS3 Anchor Tooltips and some new set of the same CSS for image_tooltip shortcode , let ’s test the shortcodes .
Insert the following code on your page or posts if you want to display text tooltip :
[ tooltip class =" top_tooltip " title = " Testing tooltip " ]
Text here [ / tooltip ]
And if you want an image tooltip use the following shortcode :
[ tooltip_image src= " your image link here " ]
Text here [ / tooltip_image ]
Conclusion
You did it !
Now you can easily create all kinds of custom Shortcode functionality and integrate it into your WordPress site .
Hope you learned something on this tutorial and do n’t forget to always check the WordPress Codex for changes in the rules in creating a shortcode .
Have you created the same shortcodes before ?

President Obama may finally get to taste a Maine microbrew .
Obama is vacationing with his family in Bar Harbor , a perfect spot to sample Bar Harbor Real Ale , Cadillac Mountain Stout and lots of other Maine - made beers .
Additional Photos Bill Milliken , co-owner of Maine Beer and Beverage Corp. , hopes President Obama gets a chance to sit back in Bar Harbor and , finally , sample some Maine brew .
April 2010 Press Herald File Related Headlines
First family samples the way life should be
The president ’s thirst for local brew made news during his last visit , when he spoke at the Portland Expo on April 1 and made a very public request of Bill Milliken , co-owner of Maine Beer and Beverage Corp. in Monument Square .
Obama used Milliken to explain the benefits of health care reform for small business owners .
“ In exchange for this publicity , I hope that I ’m going to get some samples of the beer , ” Obama said as Milliken stood in the audience .
“ OK , he nodded in the affirmative , ” the president said .
Milliken and members of the Maine Brewers Guild later put together a basket of Maine beer and other goodies and handed it off to the staff of U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree .
The beer eventually made it to Washington , D.C. , but it never did get inside the White House gate .
“ They will not accept any gifts of food at the White House , ” said Willy Ritch , Pingree ’s spokesman .
“ I think the story was , everything would have to get crushed in the process , which does n’t do much for beer . ”
Ritch said some of the other gifts , such as T - shirts , did get to the White House office that handles gifts .
Milliken said Friday that it was too bad the Secret Service could n’t make an exception for the beer .
“ He asked for it , ” said Milliken , who was a lawyer in a previous career .
“ I said , ‘ It ’s not really a gift .
It ’s kind of a contract . ’“
While Milliken said the idea that “ the Maine Brewers Guild is an al - Qaida sleeper cell ” is ridiculous , but he kind of understands .
He just hopes the president , a former lawyer himself , is n’t angry at him for not holding up his end of the bargain .
It ’s more likely , he said , that the whole beer deal slipped Obama ’s mind .
“ You did have the oil spill and that general getting fired and some other stuff , ” Milliken said .
Either way , Milliken said , he hopes that Obama is getting a chance to sit back in Bar Harbor and , finally , sample some Maine brew .

Concurrency in the D Programming Language
By Andrei Alexandrescu
Date : Jul 6 , 2010
Sample Chapter is provided courtesy of Addison - Wesley Professional .
Return to the article
Andrei Alexandrescu explains recent hardware changes allowing concurrency and how the D programming languages addresses these possibilities .
Convergence of various factors in the hardware industry has led to qualitative changes in the way we are able to access computing resources , which in turn prompts profound changes in the ways we approach computing and in the language abstractions we use .
Concurrency is now virtually everywhere , and it is software 's responsibility to tap into it .
Although the software industry as a whole does not yet have ultimate responses to the challenges brought about by the concurrency revolution , D's youth allowed its creators to make informed decisions regarding concurrency without being tied down by obsoleted past choices or large legacy code bases .
A major break with the mold of concurrent imperative languages is that D does not foster sharing of data between threads ; by default , concurrent threads are virtually isolated by language mechanisms .
Data sharing is allowed but only in limited , controlled ways that offer the compiler the ability to provide strong global guarantees .
At the same time , D remains at heart a systems programming language , so it does allow you to use a variety of low - level , maverick approaches to concurrency .
( Some of these mechanisms are not , however , allowed in safe programs . )
In brief , here 's how D's concurrency offering is layered :
The flagship approach to concurrency is to use isolated threads or processes that communicate via messages .
This paradigm , known as message passing , leads to safe and modular programs that are easy to understand and maintain .
A variety of languages and libraries have used message passing successfully .
Historically message passing has been slower than approaches based on memory sharing — which explains why it was not unanimously adopted — but that trend has recently undergone a definite and lasting reversal .
Concurrent D programs are encouraged to use message passing , a paradigm that benefits from extensive infrastructure support .
D also provides support for old - style synchronization based on critical sections protected by mutexes and event variables .
This approach to concurrency has recently come under heavy criticism because of its failure to scale well to today 's and tomorrow 's highly parallel architectures .
D imposes strict control over data sharing , which in turn curbs lock - based programming styles .
Such restrictions may seem quite harsh at first , but they cure lock - based code of its worst enemy : low - level data races .
Data sharing remains , however , the most efficient means to pass large quantities of data across threads , so it should not be neglected .
In the tradition of system - level languages , D programs not marked as @safe may use casts to obtain hot , bubbly , unchecked data sharing .
The correctness of such programs becomes largely your responsibility .
may use casts to obtain hot , bubbly , unchecked data sharing .
The correctness of such programs becomes largely your responsibility .
If that level of control is insufficient for you , you can use asm statements for ultimate control of your machine 's resources .
To go any lower - level than that , you 'd need a miniature soldering iron and a very , very steady hand .
Before getting into the thick of these topics , let 's take a brief detour in order to gain a better understanding of the hardware developments that have shaken our world .
13.1 Concurrentgate
When it comes to concurrency , we are living in the proverbial interesting times more than ever before .
Interesting times come in the form of a mix of good and bad news that contributes to a complex landscape of trade - offs , forces , and trends .
The good news is that density of integration is still increasing by Moore 's law ; with what we know and what we can reasonably project right now , that trend will continue for at least one more decade after the time of this writing .
Increased miniaturization begets increased computing power density because more transistors can be put to work together per area unit .
Since components are closer together , connections are also shorter , which means faster local interconnectivity .
It 's an efficiency bonanza .
Unfortunately , there are a number of sentences starting with " unfortunately " that curb the enthusiasm around increased computational density .
For one , connectivity is not only local — it forms a hierarchy [ 16 ] : closely connected components form units that must connect to other units , forming larger units .
In turn , the larger units also connect to other larger units , forming even larger functional blocks , and so on .
Connectivity - wise , such larger blocks remain " far away " from each other .
Worse , increased complexity of each block increases the complexity of connectivity between blocks , which is achieved by reducing the thickness of wires and the distance between them .
That means an increase of resistance , capacity , and crosstalk .
Resistance and capacity worsen propagation speed in the wire .
Crosstalk is the propensity of the signal in one wire to propagate to a nearby wire by ( in this case ) electromagnetic field .
At high frequencies , a wire is just an antenna and crosstalk becomes so unbearable that serial communication increasingly replaces parallel communication ( a somewhat counterintuitive phenomenon visible at all scales — USB replaced the parallel port , SATA replaced PATA as the disk data connector , and serial buses are replacing parallel buses in memory subsystems , all because of crosstalk .
Where are the days when parallel was fast and serial was slow ? ) .
Also , the speed gap between processing elements and memory is also increasing .
Whereas memory density has been increasing at predictably the same rate as general integration density , its access speed is increasingly lagging behind computation speed for a variety of physical , technological , and market - related reasons [ 22 ] .
It is unclear at this time how the speed gap could be significantly reduced , and it is only growing .
Hundreds of cycles may separate the processor from a word in memory ; only a few years ago , you could buy " zero wait states " memory chips accessible in one clock cycle .
The existence of a spectrum of memory architectures that navigate different trade - offs among density , price , and speed , has caused an increased sophistication of memory hierarchies ; accessing one memory word has become a detective investigation that involves questioning several cache levels , starting with precious on - chip static RAM and going possibly all the way to mass storage .
Conversely , a given datum could be found replicated in a number of places throughout the cache hierarchy , which in turn influences programming models .
We can't afford anymore to think of memory as a big , monolithic chunk comfortably shared by all processors in a system : caches foster local memory traffic and make shared data an illusion that is increasingly difficult to maintain [ 37 ] .
In related , late - breaking news , the speed of light has obstinately decided to stay constant ( immutable if you wish ) at about 300,000,000 meters per second .
The speed of light in silicon oxide ( relevant to signal propagation inside today 's chips ) is about half that , and the speed we can achieve today for transmitting actual data is significantly below that theoretical limit .
That spells more trouble for global interconnectivity at high frequencies .
If we wanted to build a 10GHz chip , under ideal conditions it would take three cycles just to transport a bit across a 4.5 - centimeter - wide chip while essentially performing no computation .
In brief , we are converging toward processors of very high density and huge computational power that are , however , becoming increasingly isolated and difficult to reach and use because of limits dictated by interconnectivity , signal propagation speed , and memory access speed .
The computing industry is naturally flowing around these barriers .
One phenomenon has been the implosion of the size and energy required for a given computational power ; today 's addictive portable digital assistants could not have been fabricated at the same size and capabilities with technology only five years old .
Today 's trends , however , do n't help traditional computers that want to achieve increased computational power at about the same size .
For those , chip makers decided to give up the battle for faster clock rates and instead decided to offer computing power packaged in already known ways : several identical central processing unit ( CPUs ) connected to each other and to memory via buses .
Thus , in a matter of a few short years , the responsibility for making computers faster has largely shifted from the hardware crowd to the software crowd .
More CPUs may seem like an advantageous proposition , but for regular desktop computer workloads it becomes tenuous to gainfully employ more than around eight processors .
Future trends project an exponential expansion of the number of available CPUs well into the dozens , hundreds , and thousands .
To speed up one given program , a lot of hard programming work is needed to put those CPUs to good use .
The computing industry has always had moves and shakes caused by various technological and human factors , but this time around we seem to be at the end of the rope .
Since only a short time ago , taking a vacation is not an option for increasing the speed of your program .
It 's a scandal .
It 's an outrage .
It 's Concurrentgate .
13.2 A Brief History of Data Sharing
One aspect of the shift happening in computing is the suddenness with which processing and concurrency models are changing today , particularly in comparison and contrast to the pace of development of programming languages and paradigms .
It takes years and decades for programming languages and their associated styles to become imprinted into a community 's lore , whereas changes in concurrency matters turned a definite exponential elbow starting around the beginning of the 2000s .
For example , our yesteryear understanding of general concurrency1 was centered around time sharing , which in turn originated with the mainframes of the 1960s .
Back then , CPU time was so expensive , it made sense to share the CPU across multiple programs controlled from multiple consoles so as to increase overall utilization .
A process was and is defined as the state and the resources of a running program .
To implement time sharing , the CPU uses a timer interrupt in conjunction with a software scheduler .
Upon each timer interrupt , the scheduler decides which process gets CPU time for the next time quantum , thus giving the illusion that several processes are running simultaneously , when in fact they all use the same CPU .
To prevent buggy processes from stomping over one another and over operating system code , hardware memory protection has been introduced .
In today 's systems , memory protection is combined with memory virtualization to ensure robust process isolation : each process thinks it " owns " the machine 's memory , whereas in fact a translation layer from logical addresses ( as the process sees memory ) to physical addresses ( as the machine accesses memory ) intermediates all interaction of processes with memory and isolates processes from one another .
The good news is that runaway processes can harm only themselves , but not other processes or the operating system kernel .
The less good news is that upon each task switching , a potentially expensive swapping of address translation paraphernalia also has to occur , not to mention that every just - switched - to process wakes up with cache amnesia as the global shared cache was most likely used by other processes .
And that 's how threads were born .
A thread is a process without associated address translation information — a bare execution context : processor state plus stack .
Several threads share the address space of a process , which means that threads are relatively cheap to start and switch among , and also that they can easily and cheaply share data with each other .
Sharing memory across threads running against one CPU is as straightforward as possible — one thread writes , another reads .
With time sharing , the order in which data is written by one thread is naturally the same as the order in which those writes are seen by others .
Maintaining higher - level data invariants is ensured by using interlocking mechanisms such as critical sections protected by synchronization primitives ( such as semaphores and mutexes ) .
Through the late twentieth century , a large body of knowledge , folklore , and anecdotes has grown around what could be called " classic " multithreaded programming , characterized by shared address space , simple rules for memory effect visibility , and mutex - driven synchronization .
Other models of concurrency existed , but classic multithreading was the most used on mainstream hardware .
Today 's mainstream imperative languages such as C , C++ , Java , or C# have been developed during the classic multithreading age — the good old days of simple memory architectures , straightforward data sharing , and well - understood interlocking primitives .
Naturally , languages modeled the realities of that hardware by accommodating threads that all share the same memory .
After all , the very definition of multithreading entails that all threads share the same address space , unlike operating system processes .
In addition , message - passing APIs ( such as the MPI specification [ 29 ] ) have been available in library form , initially for high - end hardware such as ( super ) computer clusters .
During the same historical period , the then - nascent functional languages adopted a principled position based on mathematical purity : we 're not interested in modeling hardware , they said , but we 'd like to model math .
And math for the most part does not have mutation and is time - invariant , which makes it an ideal candidate for parallelization .
( Imagine the moment when those first mathematicians - turned - programmers heard about concurrency — they must have slapped their foreheads : " Wait a minute !... " )
It was well noted in functional programming circles that such a computational model does inherently favor out - of - order , concurrent execution , but that potential was more of a latent energy than a realized goal until recent times .
Finally , Erlang was developed starting in the late 1980s as a domain - specific embedded language for telephony applications .
The domain required tens of thousands of simultaneous programs running on the same machine and strongly favored a message - passing , " fire - and - forget " communication style .
Although mainstream hardware and operating systems were not optimized for such workloads , Erlang initially ran on specialized hardware .
The result was a language that originally combined an impure functional style with heavy concurrency abilities and a staunch message - passing , no -sharing approach to communication .
Fast - forward to the 2010s .
Today , even run -of - the - mill machines have more than one processor , and the decade 's main challenge is to stick ever more CPUs on a chip .
This has had a number of consequences , the most important being the demise of seamless shared memory .
One time - shared CPU has one memory subsystem attached to it — with buffers , several levels of caches , the works .
No matter how the CPU is time - shared , reads and writes go through the same pipeline ; as such , a coherent view of memory is maintained across all threads .
In contrast , multiple interconnected CPUs cannot afford to share the cache subsystem : such a cache would need multiport access ( expensive and poorly scalable ) and would be difficult to place in the proximity of all CPUs simultaneously .
Therefore , today 's CPUs , almost without exception , come with their own dedicated cache memory .
The hardware and protocols connecting the CPU + cache combos together are a crucial factor influencing multiprocessor system performance .
The existence of multiple caches makes data sharing across threads devilishly difficult .
Now reads and writes in different threads may hit different caches , so sharing data from one thread to another is not straightforward anymore and , in fact , becomes a message passing of sorts : 2 for any such sharing , a sort of handshake must occur among cache subsystems to ensure that shared data makes it from the latest writer to the reader and also to the main memory .
As if things were n't interesting enough already , cache synchronization protocols add one more twist to the plot : they manipulate data in blocks , not individual word reads and word writes .
This means that communicating processors " forget " the exact order in which data was written , leading to paradoxical behavior that apparently defies causality and common sense : one thread writes x and then y and for a while another thread sees the new y but only the old x .
Such causality violations are extremely difficult to integrate within the general model of classic multithreading , which is imbued with the intuition of time slicing and with a simple memory model .
Even the most expert programmers in classic multithreading find it unbelievably difficult to adapt their programming styles and patterns to the new memory architectures .
To illustrate the rapid changes in today 's concurrency world and also the heavy influence of data sharing on languages ' approach to concurrency , consider the following piece of advice given in the 2001 edition of the excellent book Effective Java [ 8 , Item 51 , page 204 ] :
When multiple threads are runnable , the thread scheduler determines which threads get to run and for how long ....
The best way to write a robust , responsive , portable multithreaded application is to ensure that there are few runnable threads at any given time .
One startling detail for today 's observer is that single - processor , time - sliced threading is not only addressed by the quote above , but actually assumed without being stated .
Naturally , the book 's 2008 edition3 [ 9 ] changes the advice to " ensure that the average number of runnable threads is not significantly greater than the number of processors . "
Interestingly , even that advice , although it looks reasonable , makes a couple of unstated assumptions : one , that there will be high data contention between threads , which in turn causes degradation of performance due to interlocking overheads ; and two , that the number of processors does not vary dramatically across machines that may execute the program .
As such , the advice is contrary to that given , repeatedly and in the strongest terms , in the Programming Erlang book [ 5 , Chapter 20 , page 363 ] :
Use Lots of Processes
This is important — we have to keep the CPUs busy .
All the CPUs must be busy all the time .
The easiest way to achieve this is to have lots of processes .
4
When I say lots of processes , I mean lots in relation to the number of CPUs .
If we have lots of processes , then we wo n't need to worry about keeping the CPUs busy .
Which recommendation is correct ?
As usual , it all depends .
The first recommendation works well on 2001 - vintage hardware ; the second works well in scenarios of intensive data sharing and consequently high contention ; and the third works best in low - contention , high - CPU - count scenarios .
Because of the increasing difficulty of sharing memory , today 's trends make data sharing tenuous and favor functional and message - passing approaches .
Not incidentally , recent years have witnessed an increased interest in Erlang and other functional languages for concurrent applications .
13.3 Look , Ma , No ( Default ) Sharing
In the wake of the recent hardware and software developments , D chose to make a radical departure from other imperative languages : yes , D does support threads , but they do not share any mutable data by default — they are isolated from each other .
Isolation is not achieved via hardware as in the case of processes , and it is not achieved through runtime checks ; it is a natural consequence of the way D's type system is designed .
Such a decision is inspired by functional languages , which also strive to disallow all mutation and consequently mutable sharing .
There are two differences .
First , D programs can still use mutation freely — it 's just that mutable data is not unwittingly accessible to other threads .
Second , no sharing is a default choice , not the only one .
To define data as being shared across threads , you must qualify its type with shared .
Consider , for example , two simple module - scope definitions :
int perThread ; shared int perProcess ;
In most languages , the first definition ( or its syntactic equivalent ) would introduce a global variable used by all threads ; however , in D , perThread has a separate copy for each thread .
The second declaration allocates only one int that is shared across all threads , so in a way it is closer ( but not identical ) to a traditional global variable .
The variable perThread is stored using an operating system facility known as thread - local storage ( TLS ) .
The access speed of TLS - allocated data is dependent upon the compiler implementation and the underlying operating system .
Generally it is negligibly slower than accessing a regular global variable in a C program , for example .
In the rare cases when that may be a concern , you may want to load the global into a stack variable in access - intensive loops .
This setup has two important advantages .
First , default - share languages must carefully synchronize access around global data ; that is not necessary for perThread because it is private to each thread .
Second , the shared qualifier means that the type system and the human user are both in the know that perProcess is accessed by multiple threads simultaneously .
In particular , the type system will actively guard the use of shared data and disallow uses that are obviously mistaken .
This turns the traditional setup on its head : under a default - share regime , the programmer must keep track manually of which data is shared and which is n't , and indeed most concurrency - related bugs are caused by undue or unprotected sharing .
Under the explicit shared regime , the programmer knows for sure that data not marked as shared is never indeed visible to more than one thread .
( To ensure that guarantee , shared values undergo additional checks that we 'll get to soon . )
Using shared data remains an advanced topic because although low - level coherence is automatically ensured by the type system , high - level invariants may not be .
To provide safe , simple , and efficient communication between threads , the preferred method is to use a paradigm known as message passing .
Memory - isolated threads communicate by sending each other asynchronous messages , which consist simply of D values packaged together .
Isolated workers communicating via simple channels are a very robust , time - proven approach to concurrency .
Erlang has done that for years , as have applications based on the Message Passing Interface ( MPI ) specification [ 29 ] .
To add acclaim to remedy , 5 good programming practice even in default - share multithreaded languages actually enshrines that threads ought to be isolated .
Herb Sutter , a world - class expert in concurrency , writes in an article eloquently entitled " Use threads correctly = isolation + asynchronous messages " [ 54 ] :
Threads are a low - level tool for expressing asynchronous work .
" Uplevel " them by applying discipline : strive to make their data private , and have them communicate and synchronize using asynchronous messages .
Each thread that needs to get information from other threads or from people should have a message queue , whether a simple FIFO queue or a priority queue , and organize its work around an event - driven message pump mainline ; replacing spaghetti with event - driven logic is a great way to improve the clarity and determinism of your code .
If there is one thing that decades of computing have taught us , it must be that discipline - oriented programming does not scale .
It is reassuring , then , to reckon that the quote above pretty much summarizes quite accurately the following few sections , save for the discipline part .
13.4 Starting a Thread
To start a thread , use the spawn function like this :
import std.concurrency , std.stdio ; void main ( ) { auto low = 0 , high = 100 ; spawn ( &fun , low , high ) ; foreach ( i ; low .. high ) { writeln ( " Main thread : " , i ) ; } } void fun( int low , int high ) { foreach ( i ; low .. high ) { writeln ( " Secondary thread : " , i ) ; } }
The spawn function takes the address of a function &fun and a number of arguments < a 1 > , < a 2 > , ... , < a n >.
The number of arguments n and their types must match fun 's signature , that is , the call fun ( < a 1 > , < a 2 > , ... , < a n > ) must be correct .
This check is done at compile time .
spawn creates a new execution thread , which will issue the call fun ( < a 1 > , < a 2 > , ... , < a n > ) and then terminate .
Of course , spawn does not wait for the thread to terminate — it returns as soon as the thread is created and the arguments are passed to it ( in this case , two integers ) .
The program above outputs a total of 200 lines to the standard output .
The interleaving of lines depends on a variety of factors ; it 's possible that you would see 100 lines from the main thread followed by 100 lines from the secondary thread , the exact opposite , or some seemingly random interleaving .
There will never be , however , a mix of two messages on the same line .
This is because writeln is defined to make each call atomic with regard to its output stream .
Also , the order of lines emitted by each thread will be respected .
Even if the execution of main may end before the execution of fun in the secondary thread , the program patiently waits for all threads to finish before exiting .
This is because the runtime support library follows a little protocol for program termination , which we 'll discuss later ; for now , let 's just note that other threads do n't suddenly die just because main returns .
As promised by the isolation guarantee , the newly created thread shares nothing with the caller thread .
Well , almost nothing : the global file handle stdout is de facto shared across the two threads .
But there is no cheating : if you look at the std.stdio module 's implementation , you will see that stdout is defined as a global shared variable .
Everything is properly accounted for in the type system .
13.4.1 immutable Sharing
What kind of functions can you call via spawn ?
The no-sharing stance imposes certain restrictions — you may use only by - value parameters for the thread starter function ( fun in the example above ) .
Any pass by reference , either explicit ( by use of a ref parameter ) or implicit ( e.g. , by use of an array ) should be verboten .
With that in mind , let 's take a look at the following rewrite of the example :
import std.concurrency , std.stdio ; void main ( ) { auto low = 0 , high = 100 ; auto message = " Yeah , hi # " ; spawn ( &fun , message , low , high ) ; foreach ( i ; low .. high ) { writeln ( " Main thread : " , message , i ) ; } } void fun ( string text , int low , int high ) { foreach ( i ; low .. high ) { writeln ( " Secondary thread : " , text , i ) ; } }
The rewritten example is similar to the original , but it prints an additional string .
That string is created in the main thread and passed without copying into the secondary thread .
Effectively , the contents of message are shared between the two threads .
This violates the aforementioned principle that all data sharing must be explicitly marked through the use of the shared keyword .
Yet the example compiles and runs .
What is happening ?
Chapter 8 explains that immutable provides a strong guarantee : an immutable value is guaranteed never to change throughout its lifetime .
The same chapter explains ( § 8.2 on page 291 ) that the type string is actually an alias for immutable ( char ) [ ] .
Finally , we know that all contention is caused by sharing of writable data — as long as nobody changes it , you can share data freely as everybody will see the exact same thing .
The type system and the entire threading infrastructure acknowledge that fact by allowing all immutable data to be freely sharable across threads .
In particular , string values can be shared because their characters can't be changed .
In fact , a large part of the motivation behind introducing immutable into the language was the help it brings with sharing structured data across threads .
13.5 Exchanging Messages between Threads
Threads that print messages with arbitrary interleavings are hardly interesting .
Let 's modify the example to ensure that threads work in tandem to print messages as follows :
Main thread : 0 Secondary thread : 0 Main thread : 1 Secondary thread : 1 ... Main thread : 999 Secondary thread : 999
To achieve that , we need to define a little protocol between the two threads : the main thread should send the message " Print this number " to the secondary thread , and the secondary thread must answer back , " Done printing . "
There is hardly any concurrency going on , but the example serves well the purpose of explaining pure communication .
In real applications , threads should spend most of their time doing useful work and spend relatively little time communicating with each other .
First off , in order for two threads to communicate , they need to know how to address each other .
A program may have many threads chattering away , so an identification means is necessary .
To address a thread , you must get a grip on its thread id , nicknamed henceforth as " tid , " which is returned by spawn .
( The name of a tid's type is actually Tid . )
In turn , the secondary thread also needs a tid to send the response back .
That 's easy to do by having the sender specify its own
Tid the same way you 'd write the sender 's address on a snail mail envelope .
Here 's what the code looks like :
import std.concurrency , std.stdio ; void main ( ) { auto low = 0 , high = 100 ; auto tid = spawn ( &writer ) ; foreach ( i ; low .. high ) { writeln ( " Main thread : " , i ) ; tid.send ( this Tid , i ) ; enforce ( receiveOnly !
Tid( ) == tid ) ; } } void writer ( ) { for ( ; ; ) { auto msg = receiveOnly !
( Tid , int ) ( ) ; writeln ( " Secondary thread : " , msg [ 1 ] ) ; msg [ 0 ] . send ( this Tid ) ; } }
This time around writer takes no more arguments because it receives the information it needs in the form of messages .
The main thread saves the Tid returned by spawn and then uses it in the call to the send method .
The call sends two pieces of data to the other thread : the current thread 's Tid , accessed via the global property this Tid , and the integer to be printed .
After throwing that data over the fence to the other thread , the main thread waits for acknowledgment in the form of a call to receiveOnly .
The send and receiveOnly functions work in tandem : one call to send in one thread is met by a call to receiveOnly in the other .
The " only " in receiveOnly is present because receiveOnly accepts only specific types — for example , in the call receiveOnly ! bool ( ) , the caller accepts only a message consisting of a bool value ; if another thread sends anything else , receiveOnly throws a MessageMismatch exception .
Let 's leave main rummaging around the foreach loop and focus on writer 's implementation , which implements the other side of the mini-protocol .
writer spends time in a loop starting with the receipt of a message that must consist of a Tid and an int .
That 's what the call receiveOnly !
( Tid , int ) ( ) ensures ; again , if the main thread sent a message with some different number or types of arguments , receiveOnly would fail by throwing an exception .
As written , the receiveOnly call in writer matches perfectly the call tid. send ( this Tid , i ) made from main .
The type of msg is Tuple !
( Tid , int ) .
Generally , messages with multiple arguments are packed in Tuple objects with one member per argument .
If , however , the message consists only of one value , there 's no redundant packing in a Tuple .
For example , receiveOnly!int ( ) returns an int , not a Tuple ! int .
Continuing with writer , the next line performs the actual printing .
Recall that for the tuple msg , msg [ 0 ] accesses the first member ( i.e. , the Tid ) and msg [ 1 ] accesses the second member ( the int ) .
Finally , writer acknowledges that it finished writing to the console by simply sending its own Tid back to the sender — a sort of a blank letter that only confirms the originating address .
" Yes , I got your message , " the empty letter implies , " and acted upon it .
Your turn . "
The main thread waits for that confirmation before continuing its work , and the loop goes on .
Sending back the Tid of the secondary thread is superfluous in this case ; any dummy value , such as an int or a bool , would have sufficed .
But in the general case there are many threads sending messages to one another , so self - identification becomes important .
13.6 Pattern Matching with receive
Most useful communication protocols are more complex than the one we defined above , and receiveOnly is quite limited .
For example , it is quite difficult to implement with receiveOnly an action such as " receive an int or a string . "
A more powerful primitive is receive , which matches and dispatches messages based on their type .
A typical call to receive looks like this :
receive ( ( string s ) { writeln ( " Got a string with value " , s ) ; } , ( int x ) { writeln ( " Got an int with value " , x ) ; } ) ;
The call above matches any of the following send calls :
send ( tid , " hello " ) ; send ( tid , 5 ) ; send ( tid , 'a ' ) ; send ( tid , 42u ) ;
The first send call matches a string and is therefore dispatched to the first function literal in receive , and the other three match an int and are passed to the second function literal .
By the way , the handler functions do n't need to be literals — some or all of them may be addresses of named functions :
void handleString ( string s ) { ... } receive ( &handleString , ( int x ) { writeln ( " Got an int with value " , x ) ; } ) ;
Matching is not exact ; instead , it follows normal overloading rules , by which char and uint are implicitly convertible to int .
Conversely , the following calls will not be matched :
send ( tid , " hello " w ) ; // UTF - 16 string ( § 4.5 on page 118 ) send ( tid , 5L ) ; // long send ( tid , 42.0 ) ; // double
When receive sees a message of an unexpected type , it does n't throw an exception ( as receiveOnly does ) .
The message - passing subsystem simply saves the non-matching messages in a queue , colloquially known as the thread 's mailbox .
receive waits patiently for the arrival of a message of a matching type in the mailbox .
This makes receive and the protocols implemented on top of it more flexible , but also more susceptible to blocking and mailbox crowding .
One communication misunderstanding is enough for a thread 's mailbox to accumulate messages of the wrong type while receive is waiting for a message type that never arrives .
The send / receive combo handles multiple arguments easily by using Tuple as an intermediary .
For example :
receive ( ( long x , double y ) { ... } , ( int x ) { ... } ) ;
matches the same messages as
receive( ( Tuple ! ( long , double ) tp ) { ... } , ( int x ) { ... } ) ;
A call like send ( tid , 5 , 6.3 ) matches the first function literal in both examples above .
To allow a thread to take contingency action in case messages are delayed , receive has a variant receiveTimeout that expires after a specified time .
The expiration is signaled by receiveTimeout returning false :
auto gotMessage = receiveTimeout ( 1000 , // Time in milliseconds ( string s ) { writeln ( " Got a string with value " , s ) ; } , ( int x ) { writeln ( " Got an int with value " , x ) ; } ) ; if ( ! gotMessage ) { stderr.
writeln
( " Timed out after one second . " ) ; }
13.6.1 First Match
Consider the following example :
receive ( ( long x ) { ... } , ( string x ) { ... } , ( int x ) { ... } ) ;
This call will not compile : receive rejects the call because the third handler could never be reached .
Any int sent down the pipe stops at the first handler .
In receive , the order of arguments dictates how matches are attempted .
This is similar , for example , to how catch clauses are evaluated in a try statement but is unlike object - oriented function dispatch .
Reasonable people may disagree on the relative qualities of first match and best match ; suffice it to say that first match seems to serve this particular form of receive quite well .
The compile - time enforcement performed by receive is simple : for any message types < Msg 1 > and < Msg 2 > with < Msg 2 >'s handler coming after < Msg 1 >'s in the receive call , receive makes sure that < Msg 2 > is not convertible to < Msg 1 >.
If it is , that means < Msg 1 > will match messages of type < Msg 2 > so compilation of the call is refused .
In the example above , the check fails when < Msg 1 > is long and < Msg 2 > is int .
13.6.2 Matching Any Message
What if you wanted to make sure you 're looking at any and all messages in a mailbox — for example , to make sure it does n't get filled with junk mail ?
The answer is simple — just accept the type Variant in the last position of receive , like this :
receive ( ( long x ) { ... } , ( string x ) { ... } , ( double x , double y ) { ... } , ... ( Variant any ) { ... } ) ;
The Variant type defined in module std.variant is a dynamic type able to hold exactly one value of any other type .
receive recognizes Variant as a generic holder for any message type , and as such a call to receive that has a handler for Variant will always return as soon as at least one message is in the queue .
Planting a Variant handler at the bottom of the message handling food chain is a good method to make sure that stray messages are n't left in your mailbox .
13.7 File Copying — with a Twist
Let 's write a short program that copies files — a popular way to get acquainted with a language 's file system interface .
Ah , the joy of K&R 's classic getchar / putchar example [ 34 , Chapter 1 , page 15 ] .
Of course , the system - provided programs that copy files use buffered reads and writes and many other optimizations to accelerate transfer speed , so it would be difficult to write a competitive program , but concurrency may give an edge .
The usual approach to file copying goes like this :
Read data from the source file into a buffer .
If nothing was read , done .
Write the buffer into the target file .
Repeat from step 1 .
Adding appropriate error handling completes a useful ( if unoriginal ) program .
If you select a large enough buffer and both the source and destination files reside on the same disk , the performance of the algorithm is near optimal .
Nowadays a variety of physical devices count as file repositories , such as hard drives , thumb drives , optical disks , connected smart phones , and remotely connected network services .
These devices have various latency and speed profiles and connect to the computer via different hardware and software interfaces .
Such interfaces could and should be put to work in parallel , not one at a time as the " read buffer / write buffer " algorithm above prescribes .
Ideally , both the source and the target device should be kept as busy as possible , something we could effect with two threads following the producer - consumer protocol :
Spawn one secondary thread that listens to messages containing memory buffers and writes them to the target file in a loop .
Read data from the source file in a newly allocated buffer .
If nothing was read , done .
Send a message containing the read buffer to the secondary thread .
Repeat from step 2 .
In the new setup , one thread keeps the source busy and the other keeps the target busy .
Depending on the nature of the source and target , significant acceleration could be obtained .
If the device speeds are comparable and relatively slow compared to the bandwidth of the memory bus , the speed of copying could theoretically be doubled .
Let 's write a simple producer - consumer program that copies stdin to stdout :
import std.algorithm , std.concurrency , std.stdio ; void main ( ) { enum bufferSize = 1024 * 100 ; auto tid = spawn ( &fileWriter ) ; // Read loop foreach ( immutable ( ubyte ) [ ] buffer ; stdin.byChunk ( bufferSize ) ) { send ( tid , buffer ) ; } } void fileWriter ( ) { //
Write loop for ( ; ; ) { auto buffer = receiveOnly !( immutable ( ubyte ) [ ] ) ( ) ; tgt.write ( buffer ) ; } }
The program above transfers data from the main thread to the secondary thread through immutable sharing : the messages passed have the type immutable ( ubyte ) [ ] , that is , arrays of immutable unsigned bytes .
Those buffers are acquired in the foreach loop by reading input in chunks of type immutable ( ubyte ) [ ] , each of size bufferSize .
At each pass through the loop , one new buffer is allocated , read into , and bound to buffer .
The foreach control part does most of the hard work ; all the body has to do is send off the buffer to the secondary thread .
As discussed , passing data around is possible because of immutable ; if you replaced immutable ( ubyte ) [ ] with ubyte [ ] , the call to send would not compile .
13.8 Thread Termination
There 's something unusual about the examples given so far , in particular writer defined on page 402 and fileWriter defined on the facing page : both functions contain an infinite loop .
In fact , a closer look at the file copy example reveals that main and fileWriter understand each other well regarding copying things around but never discuss application termination ; in other words , main does not ever tell fileWriter , " We 're done ; let 's finish and go home . "
Termination of multithreaded applications has always been tricky .
Threads are easy to start , but once started they are difficult to finish ; the application shutdown event is asynchronous and may catch a thread in the middle of an arbitrary operation .
Low - level threading APIs do offer a means to forcefully terminate threads , but invariably with the cautionary note that such a function is a blunt tool that should be replaced with a higher - level shutdown protocol .
D offers a simple and robust thread termination protocol .
Each thread has an owner thread ; by default the owner is the thread that initiated the spawn .
You can change the current thread 's owner dynamically by calling setOwner ( tid ) .
Each thread has exactly one owner but a given thread may own multiple threads .
The most important manifestation of the owner / owned relationship is that when the owner thread terminates , the calls to receive in the owned thread will throw the OwnerTerminated exception .
The exception is thrown only if receive has no more matching messages and must wait for a new message ; as long as receive has something to fetch from the mailbox , it will not throw .
In other words , when the owner thread terminates , the owned threads ' calls to receive ( or receiveOnly for that matter ) will throw OwnerTerminated if and only if they would otherwise block waiting for a new message .
The ownership relation is not necessarily unidirectional .
In fact , two threads may even own each other ; in that case , whichever thread finishes will notify the other .
With thread ownership in mind , let 's take a fresh look at the file copy program on page 406 .
At any given moment , there are a number of messages in flight between the main thread and the secondary thread .
The faster the reads are relative to writes , the more buffers will wait in the writer thread 's mailbox waiting to be processed .
When main returns , it will cause the call to receive to throw an exception , but not before all of the pending messages are handled .
Right after the mailbox of the writer is cleared ( and the last drop of data is written to the target file ) , the next call to receive throws .
The writer thread exits with the OwnerTerminated exception , which is recognized by the runtime system , which simply ignores it .
The operating system closes stdin and stdout as it always does , and the copy operation succeeds .
It may appear there is a race between the moment the last message is sent from main and the moment main returns ( causing receive to throw ) .
What if the exception " makes it " before the last message — or worse , before the last few messages ?
In fact there is no race because causality is always respected in the posting thread : the last message is posted onto the secondary thread 's queue before the OwnerTerminated exception makes its way ( in fact , propagating the exception is done via the same queue as regular messages ) .
However , a race would exist if main exits while a different , third thread is posting messages onto fileWriter 's queue .
A similar reasoning shows that our previous simple example that writes 200 messages in lockstep is also correct : main exits after mailing ( in the nick of time ) the last message to the secondary thread .
The secondary thread first exhausts the queue and then ends with the OwnerTerminated exception .
If you find throwing an exception too harsh a mechanism for handling a thread 's exit , you can always handle OwnerTerminated explicitly :
// Ends without an exception void fileWriter ( ) { //
Write loop for ( bool running = true ; running ; ) { receive ( ( immutable ( ubyte ) [ ] buffer ) { tgt.write ( buffer ) ; } , ( OwnerTerminated ) { running = false ; } ) ; } stderr.writeln ( " Normally terminated . " ) ; }
In this case , file Writer returns peacefully when main exits and everyone 's happy .
But what happens in the case when the secondary thread — the writer — throws an exception ?
The call to the write function may fail if there 's a problem writing data to tgt .
In that case , the call to send from the primary thread will fail by throwing an OwnedFailed exception , which is exactly what should happen .
By the way , if an owned thread exits normally ( as opposed to throwing an exception ) , subsequent calls to send to that thread also fail , just with a different exception type : OwnedTerminated .
The file copy program is more robust than its simplicity may suggest .
However , it should be said that relying on the default termination protocol works smoothly when the relationships between threads are simple and well understood .
When there are many participating threads and the ownership graph is complex , it is best to establish explicit " end-of - communication " protocols throughout .
In the file copy example , a simple idea would be to send by convention a buffer of size zero to signal the writer that the reading thread has finished successfully .
Then the writer acknowledges termination to the reader , which finally can exit .
Such an explicit protocol scales well to cases when there are multiple threads processing the data stream between the reader and the writer .
13.9 Out - of - Band Communication
Consider that you 're using the presumably smart file - copying program we just defined to copy a large file from a fast local store to a slow network drive .
Midway through the copy , there 's a read error — the file is corrupt .
That causes read and subsequently main to throw an exception while there are many buffers in flight that have n't yet been written .
More generally , we saw that if the owner terminates normally , any blocking call to receive from its owned threads will throw .
What happens if the owner exits with an exception ?
If a thread terminates by means of an exception , that indicates a serious issue that must be signaled with relative urgency to the owned threads .
Indeed this is carried out via an out - of - band message .
Recall that receive cares only about matching messages and lets all others accumulate in the queue .
There is one amendment to that behavior .
A thread may initiate an out - of - band message by calling priority Send instead of send .
The two functions accept the same parameters but exhibit different behaviors that actually manifest themselves on the receiving side .
Passing a message of type T with prioritySend causes receive in the receiving thread to act as follows :
If the call to receive handles type T , then the priority message will be the next message handled , even though it arrived later than other regular ( non-priority ) messages .
Priority messages are always pushed to the beginning of the queue , so the latest priority message sent is always the first fetched by receive ( even if other priority messages are already waiting ) .
handles type , then the priority message will be the next message handled , even though it arrived later than other regular ( non-priority ) messages .
Priority messages are always pushed to the beginning of the queue , so the latest priority message sent is always the first fetched by ( even if other priority messages are already waiting ) .
If the call to receive does not handle type T ( i.e. , would leave the message waiting in the mailbox ) and if T inherits Exception , receive throws the message directly .
does not handle type ( i.e. , would leave the message waiting in the mailbox ) and if inherits , throws the message directly .
If the call to receive does not handle type T and T does not inherit Exception , receive throws an exception of type Priority MessageException !
T .
That exception holds a copy of the message sent in the form of a member called message .
If a thread exits via an exception , the exception OwnerFailed propagates to all of its owned threads by means of priority Send .
In the file copy program , main throwing also causes fileWriter to throw as soon as it calls receive , and the entire process terminates by printing an error message and returning a nonzero exit code .
Unlike the normal termination case , there may be buffers in flight that have been read but not yet written .
13.10 Mailbox Crowding
The producer - consumer file copy program works quite well but has an important shortcoming .
Consider copying a large file between two devices of different speeds , for example , copying a legally acquired movie file from an internal drive ( fast ) to a network drive ( possibly considerably slower ) .
In that case , the producer ( the main thread ) issues buffers at considerable speed , much faster than the speed with which the consumer is able to unload them in the target file .
The difference in the two speeds causes a net accumulation of buffers , which may cause the program to consume a lot of memory without achieving a boost in efficiency .
To avoid mailbox crowding , the concurrency API allows setting the maximum size of a thread 's message queue , and also setting the action to take in case the maximum size has been reached .
The signatures of relevance here are
// Inside std.concurrency void setMaxMailboxSize
( Tid tid , size_t messages , bool ( Tid ) onCrowdingDoThis ) ;
The call setMaxMailboxSize ( tid , messages , onCrowdingDoThis ) directs the concurrency API to call onCrowdingDoThis ( tid ) whenever a new message is to be passed but the queue already contains messages entries .
If onCrowdingDoThis ( tid ) returns false or throws an exception , the new message is ignored .
Otherwise , the size of the thread 's queue is checked again , and if it is less than messages , the new message is posted to thread tid .
Otherwise , the entire loop is resumed .
The call occurs in the caller thread , not the callee .
In other words , the thread that initiates sending a message is also responsible for taking contingency action in case the maximum mailbox size of the recipient has been reached .
It seems reasonable to ask why the call should not occur in the callee ; that would , however , scale the wrong way in heavily threaded programs because threads with full mailboxes may become crippled by many calls from other threads attempting to send messages .
There are a few prepackaged actions to perform when the mailbox is full : block the caller until the queue becomes smaller , throw an exception , or ignore the new message .
Such predefined actions are conveniently packaged as follows :
// Inside std.concurrency enum OnCrowding { block , throwException , ignore } void setMaxMailboxSize ( Tid tid , size_t messages , OnCrowding doThis ) ;
In our case , it 's best to simply block the reader thread once the mailbox becomes too large , which we can effect by inserting the call
setMaxMailboxSize( tid , 1024 , OnCrowding.block ) ;
right after the call to spawn .
The following sections describe approaches to inter - thread communication that are alternative or complementary to message passing .
Message passing is the recommended method of inter - thread communication ; it is easy to understand , fast , well behaved , reliable , and scalable .
You should descend to lower - level communication mechanisms only in special circumstances — and do n't forget , " special " is not always as special as it seems .
13.11 The shared Type Qualifier
We already got acquainted with shared in § 13.3 on page 397 .
To the type system , shared indicates that several threads have access to a piece of data .
The compiler acknowledges that reality by restricting operations on shared data and by generating special code for the accepted operations .
The global definition
shared uint threadsCount ;
introduces a value of type shared ( uint ) , which corresponds to a global unsigned int in a C program .
Such a variable is visible to all threads in the system .
The annotation helps the compiler a great deal : the language " knows " that threadsCount is freely accessible from multiple threads and forbids naïve access to it .
For example :
void bumpThreadsCount ( ) { ++threadsCount ; // Error ! //
Cannot increment a shared int ! }
What 's happening ?
Down at machine level , ++threadsCount is not an atomic operation ; it 's a read - modify - write operation : threadsCount is loaded into a register , the register value is incremented , and then threadsCount is written back to memory .
For the whole operation to be correct , these three steps need to be performed as an indivisible unit .
The correct way to increment a shared integer is to use whatever specialized atomic increment primitives the processor offers , which are portably packaged in the std.concurrency module :
import std.concurrency ; shared uint threadsCount ; void bumpThreadsCount ( ) { // std.concurrency defines // atomicOp ( string op ) ( ref shared uint , int ) atomicOp !"+= " ( threadsCount , 1 ) ; // Fine }
Because all shared data is accounted for and protected under the aegis of the language , passing shared data via send and receive is allowed .
13.11.1 The Plot Thickens : shared Is Transitive
Chapter 8 explains why const and immutable must be transitive ( aka deep or recursive ) : following any indirections starting from an immutable object must keep data immutable .
Otherwise , the immutable guarantee has the power of a comment in the code .
You can't say something is immutable " up to a point " after which it changes its mind .
You can , however , say that data is mutable up to a point , where it becomes immutable through and through .
Stepping into immutability is veering down a one - way street .
We 've seen that immutable facilitates a number of correct and pain - free idioms , including functional style and sharing of data across threads .
If immutability applied " up to a point , " then so would program correctness .
The same exact reasoning goes for shared .
In fact , with shared the necessity of transitivity becomes painfully obvious .
Consider :
shared int* pInt ;
which according to the qualifier syntax ( § 8.2 on page 291 ) is equivalent to
shared ( int *)
pInt ;
The correct meaning of pInt is " The pointer is shared and the data pointed to by the pointer is also shared . "
A shallow , non-transitive approach to sharing would make pInt " a shared pointer to non-shared memory , " which would be great if it were n't untenable .
It 's like saying , " I 'll share this wallet with everyone ; just please remember that the money in it ain't shared . " 6
Claiming the pointer is shared across threads but the pointed - to data is not takes us back to the wonderful programming - by - honor - system paradigm that has failed so successfully throughout history .
It 's not the voluntary malicious uses , it 's the honest mistakes that form the bulk of problems .
Software is large , complex , and ever - changing , traits that never go well with maintaining guarantees through convention .
There is , however , a notion of " unshared pointer to shared data " that does hold water .
Some thread holds a private pointer , and the pointer " looks " at shared data .
That is easily expressible syntactically as
shared ( int ) * pInt ;
As an aside , if there exists a " Best Form - Follows - Function " award , then the notation qualifier ( type ) should snatch it .
It 's perfect .
You can't even syntactically create the wrong pointer type , because it would look like this :
int shared (*)
pInt ;
which does not make sense even syntactically because ( * ) is not a type ( granted , it is a nice emoticon for a cyclops ) .
Transitivity of shared applies not only to pointers , but also to fields of struct and class objects : fields of a shared object are automatically qualified as shared as well .
We 'll discuss in detail the ways in which shared interacts with class es and struct s later in this chapter .
13.12 Operations with shared Data and Their Effects
Working with shared data is peculiar because multiple threads may read and write it at any moment .
Therefore , the compiler makes sure that all operations preserve integrity of data and also causality of operations .
Reads and writes of shared values are allowed and guaranteed to be atomic : numeric types ( save for real ) , pointers , arrays , function pointers , delegates , and class references .
struct types containing exactly one of the mentioned types are also readable and writable atomically .
Notably absent is real , which is the only platform - dependent type with which the implementation has discretion regarding atomic sharing .
On Intel machines , real has 80 bits , which makes it difficult to assign atomically in 32 - bit programs .
Anyway , real is meant mostly for high - precision temporary results and not for data interchange , so it makes little sense to want to share it anyway .
For all numeric types and function pointers , shared - qualified values are convertible implicitly to and from unqualified values .
Pointer conversions between shared ( T* ) and shared ( T ) * are allowed in both directions .
Primitives in std.concurrency allow you to do arithmetic on shared numeric types .
13.12.1 Sequential Consistency of shared Data
With regard to the visibility of shared data operations across threads , D makes two guarantees :
The order of reads and writes of shared data issued by one thread is the same as the order specified by the source code .
data issued by one thread is the same as the order specified by the source code .
The global order of reads and writes of shared data is some interleaving of reads and writes from multiple threads .
That seems to be a very reasonable set of assumptions — self - evident even .
In fact , the two guarantees fit time - sliced threads implemented on a uniprocessor system quite well .
On multiprocessors , however , these guarantees are very restrictive .
The problem is that in order to ensure the guarantees , all writes must be instantly visible throughout all threads .
To effect that , shared accesses must be surrounded by special machine code instructions called memory barriers , ensuring that the order of reads and writes of shared data is the same as seen by all running threads .
Such serialization is considerably more expensive in the presence of elaborate cache hierarchies .
Also , staunch adherence to sequential consistency prevents reordering of operations , an important source of compiler - level optimizations .
Combined , the two restrictions lead to dramatic slowdown — as much as one order of magnitude .
The good news is that such a speed loss occurs only with shared data , which tends to be rare .
In real programs , most data is not shared and therefore need not meet sequential consistency requirements .
The compiler optimizes code using non- shared data to the maximum , in full confidence that no other thread can ever access it , and only tiptoes around shared data .
A common and recommended programming style with shared data is to copy shared values into thread - local working copies , work on the copies , and then write the copies back into the shared values .
13.13 Lock - Based Synchronization with synchronized class es
A historically popular method of writing multithreaded programs is lock - based synchronization .
Under that discipline , access to shared data is protected by mutexes — synchronization objects that serialize execution of portions of the code that temporarily break data coherence , or that might see such a temporary breakage .
Such portions of code are called critical sections .
7
A lock - based program 's correctness is ensured by introducing ordered , serial access to shared data .
A thread that needs access to a piece of shared data must acquire ( lock ) a mutex , operate on the data , and then release ( unlock ) that mutex .
Only one thread at a time may acquire a given mutex , which is how serialization is effected : when several threads want to acquire the same mutex , one " wins " and the others wait nicely in line .
( The way the line is served — that is , thread priority — is important and may affect applications and the operating system quite visibly . )
Arguably the " Hello , world ! " of multithreaded programs is the bank account example — an object accessible from multiple threads that must expose a safe interface for depositing and withdrawing funds .
The single - threaded baseline version looks like this :
import std.contracts ; //
Single - threaded bank account class BankAccount { private double _balance ; void deposit ( double amount ) { _balance += amount ; } void withdraw ( double amount ) { enforce ( _balance >= amount ) ; _balance -= amount ; } @property double balance ( ) { return _balance ; } }
In a free - threaded world , += and -= are a tad misleading because they " look " atomic but are not — both are read - modify - write operations .
Really _balance += amount is encoded as _balance = _balance + amount , which means the processor loads _balance and _amount into its own operating memory ( registers or an internal stack ) , adds them , and deposits the result back into _balance .
Unprotected concurrent read - modify - write operations lead to incorrect behavior .
Say your account has _balance == 100.0 and one thread triggered by a check deposit calls deposit ( 50 ) .
The call gets interrupted , right after having loaded 100.0 from memory , by another thread calling withdraw ( 2.5 ) .
( That 's you at the corner coffee shop getting a latte with your debit card . )
Let 's say the coffee shop thread finishes the entire call uninterrupted and updates _balance to 97.5 , but that event happens unbeknownst to the deposit thread , which has loaded 100 into a CPU register already and still thinks that 's the right amount .
The call deposit ( 50 ) computes a new balance of 150 and writes that number back into _balance .
That is a typical race condition .
Congratulations — free coffee for you ( be warned , though ; buggy book examples may be rigged in your favor , but buggy production code is n't ) .
To introduce proper synchronization , many languages offer a Mutex type that lock - based threaded programs use to protect access to balance :
//
This is not D code // Multithreaded bank account in a language with explicit mutexes class BankAccount { private double _balance ; private Mutex _guard ; void deposit ( double amount ) { _guard.lock ( ) ; _balance += amount ; _guard.unlock ( ) ; } void withdraw ( double amount ) { _guard.lock ( ) ; try { enforce ( _balance >= amount ) ; _balance -= amount ; } finally { _guard.unlock ( ) ; } } @property double balance ( ) { _guard.lock ( ) ; double result = _balance ; _guard.unlock ( ) ; return result ; } }
All operations on _balance are now protected by acquiring _guard .
It may seem there is no need to protect balance with _guard because a double can be read atomically , but protection must be there for reasons hiding themselves under multiple layers of Maya veils .
In brief , because of today 's aggressive optimizing compilers and relaxed memory models , all access to shared data must entail some odd secret handshake that has the writing thread , the reading thread , and the optimizing compiler as participants ; absolutely any bald read of shared data throws you into a world of pain ( so it 's great that D disallows such baldness by design ) .
First and most obvious , the optimizing compiler , seeing no attempt at synchronization on your part , feels entitled to optimize access to _balance by holding it in a processor register .
Second , in all but the most trivial examples , the compiler and the CPU feel entitled to freely reorder bald , unqualified access to shared data because they consider themselves to be dealing with thread - local data .
( Why ?
Because that 's most often the case and yields the fastest code , and besides , why hurt the plebes instead of the few and the virtuous ? )
This is one of the ways in which modern multithreading defies intuition and confuses programmers versed in classic multithreading .
In brief , the balance property must be synchronized to make sure the secret handshake takes place .
To guarantee proper unlocking of Mutex in the presence of exceptions and early returns , languages with scoped object lifetime and destructors define an ancillary Lock type to acquire the lock in its constructor and release it in the destructor .
The ensuing idiom is known as scoped locking [ 50 ] and its application to BankAccount looks like this :
// C++ version of an interlocked bank account using scoped locking class BankAccount { private : double _balance ; Mutex _guard ; public : void deposit ( double amount ) { auto lock = Lock ( _guard ) ; _balance += amount ; } void withdraw ( double amount ) { auto lock = Lock ( _guard ) ; enforce ( _balance >= amount ) ; _balance -= amount ; } double balance ( ) { auto lock = Lock ( _guard ) ; return _balance ; } }
Lock simplifies code and improves its correctness by automating the pairing of locking and unlocking .
Java , C# , and other languages simplify matters further by embedding _guard as a hidden member and hoisting locking logic up to the signature of the method .
In Java , the example would look like this :
// Java version of an interlocked bank account using // automated scoped locking with the synchronized statement class BankAccount { private double _balance ; public synchronized void deposit ( double amount ) { _balance += amount ; } public synchronized void withdraw ( double amount ) { enforce ( _balance >= amount ) ; _balance -= amount ; } public synchronized double balance ( ) { return _balance ; } }
The corresponding C# code looks similar , though synchronized should be replaced with [ MethodImpl ( MethodImplOptions .
Synchronized ) ] .
Well , you 've just seen the good news : in the small , lock - based programming is easy to understand and seems to work well .
The bad news is that in the large , it is very difficult to pair locks with data appropriately , choose locking scope and granularity , and use locks consistently across several objects ( not paying attention to the latter issue leads to threads waiting for each other in a deadlock ) .
Such issues made lock - based coding difficult enough in the good ole days of classic multithreading ; modern multithreading ( with massive concurrency , relaxed memory models , and expensive data sharing ) has put lock - based programming under increasing attack [ 53 ] .
Nevertheless , lock - based synchronization is still useful in a variety of designs .
D offers limited mechanisms for lock - based synchronization .
The limits are deliberate and have the advantage of ensuring strong guarantees .
In the particular case of BankAccount , the D version is very simple :
// D interlocked bank account using a synchronized class synchronized class BankAccount { private double _balance ; void deposit ( double amount ) { _balance += amount ; } void withdraw ( double amount ) { enforce ( _balance >= amount ) ; _balance -= amount ; } double balance ( ) { return _balance ; } }
D hoists synchronized one level up to the entire class .
This allows D's BankAccount to provides stronger guarantees : even if you wanted to make a mistake , there is no way to offer back - door unsynchronized access to _balance .
If D allowed mixing synchronized and un synchronized methods in the same class , all bets would be off .
In fact , experience with method - level synchronized has shown that it 's best to either define all or none as synchronized ; dual - purpose class es are more trouble than they 're worth .
The synchronized class - level attribute affects objects of type shared ( BankAccount ) and automatically serializes calls to any method of the class .
Also , protection checks get stricter for synchronized classes .
Recall that according to § 11.1 on page 337 , normal protection checks ordinarily do allow access to non- public members for all code within a module .
Not so for synchronized class es , which obey the following rules :
No public data is allowed at all .
data is allowed at all .
Access to protected members is restricted to methods of the class and its descendants .
members is restricted to methods of the and its descendants .
Access to private members is restricted to methods of the class .
13.14 Field Typing in synchronized class es
The transitivity rule for shared objects dictates that a shared class object propagates the shared qualifier down to its fields .
Clearly synchronized brings some additional law and order to the table , which is reflected in relaxed typechecking of fields inside the methods of synchronized classes .
In order to provide strong guarantees , synchronized affects semantic checking of fields in a slightly peculiar manner , which tracks the correspondingly peculiar semantics of synchronized .
Synchronized methods ' protection against races is temporary and local .
The temporary aspect is caused by the fact that as soon as the method returns , fields are not protected against races anymore .
The local aspect concerns the fact that synchronized ensures protection of data directly embedded inside the object , but not data indirectly referred by the object ( i.e. , through class references , pointers , or arrays ) .
Let 's look at each in turn .
13.14.1 Temporary Protection == No Escape
Maybe not very intuitively , the temporary nature of synchronized entails the rule that no address of a field can escape a synchronized address .
If that happened , some other portion of the code could access some data beyond the temporary protection conferred by method - level synchronization .
The compiler will reject any attempt to return a ref or a pointer to a field out of a method , or to pass a field by ref or by pointer to some function .
To illustrate why that rule is sensible , consider the following example :
double * nyukNyuk ; // N.B. : not shared void sneaky ( ref double r ) { nyukNyuk = &r ; } synchronized class BankAccount { private double _balance ; void fun ( ) { nyukNyuk = &_balance ; // Error !
( as there should be ) sneaky ( _balance ) ; // Error !
( as there should be ) } }
The first line of fun attempts to take the address of _balance and assign it to a global .
If that operation were to succeed , the type system 's guarantee would have failed — henceforth , the program would have shared access to data through a non- shared value .
The assignment fails to typecheck .
The second operation is a tad more subtle in that it attempts to do the aliasing via a function call that takes a ref parameter .
That also fails ; practically , passing a value by means of ref entails taking the address prior to the call .
Taking the address is forbidden , so the call fails .
13.14.2 Local Protection == Tail Sharing
The protection offered by synchronized is also local in the sense that it does n't necessarily protect data beyond the direct fields of the object .
As soon as indirection enters into play , the guarantee that only one thread has access to data is lost .
If you think of data as consisting of a " head " ( the part sitting in the physical memory occupied by the BankAccount object ) and possibly a " tail " ( memory accessed indirectly ) , then a synchronized class is able to protect the " head " of the data , whereas the " tail " remains shared .
In light of that reality , typing of fields of a synchronized class inside a method goes as follows :
All numeric types are not shared ( they have no tail ) so they can be manipulated normally .
( they have no tail ) so they can be manipulated normally .
Array fields declared with type T[ ] receive type shared ( T ) [ ] ; that is , the head ( the slice limits ) is not shared and the tail ( the contents of the array ) remains shared .
receive type ; that is , the head ( the slice limits ) is not and the tail ( the contents of the array ) remains .
Pointer fields declared with type T* receive type shared ( T ) * ; that is , the head ( the pointer itself ) is not shared and the tail ( the pointed - to data ) remains shared .
receive type ; that is , the head ( the pointer itself ) is not and the tail ( the pointed - to data ) remains .
Class fields declared with type T receive type shared ( T ) .
Classes are automatically by - reference , so they 're " all tail . "
These rules apply on top of the no-escape rule described in the previous section .
One direct consequence is that operations affecting direct fields of the object can be freely reordered and optimized inside the method , as if sharing has been temporarily suspended for them — which is exactly what synchronized does .
There are cases in which an object completely owns another .
Consider , for example , that the BankAccount stores all of its past transactions in a list of double :
// Not synchronized and generally thread - agnostic class List ( T ) { ... void append ( T value ) { ... } } // Keeps a List of transactions synchronized class BankAccount { private double _balance ; private List ! double _transactions ; void deposit ( double amount ) { _balance += amount ; _transactions.append( amount ) ; } void withdraw ( double amount ) { enforce ( _balance >= amount ) ; _balance -= amount ; _transactions .append ( - amount ) ; } double balance ( ) { return _balance ; } }
The List class was not designed to be shared across threads so it does not use any synchronization mechanism , but it is in fact never shared !
All of its uses are entirely private to the BankAccount object and completely protected inside synchronized methods .
Assuming List does not do senseless shenanigans such as saving some internal pointer into a global variable , the code should be good to go .
Unfortunately , it is n't .
Code like the above would not work in D because append is not callable against a shared ( List ! double ) object .
One obvious reason for the compiler 's refusal is that the honor system does n't go well with compilers .
List may be a well - behaved class and all , but the compiler would have to have somewhat harder evidence to know that there is no sneaky aliasing of shared data afoot .
The compiler could , in theory , go ahead and inspect List 's class definition , but in turn , List may be using some other components found in other modules , and before you can say " interprocedural analysis , " things are getting out of hand .
Interprocedural analysis is a technique used by compilers and program analyzers to prove facts about a program by looking at more functions at once .
Such analyses are typically slow , scale poorly with program size , and are sworn enemies of separate compilation .
Although there exist systems that use interprocedural analysis , most of today 's languages ( including D ) do all of their typechecking without requiring it .
An alternative solution to the owned subobject problem is to add new qualifiers that describe ownership relationships such as " BankAccount owns its _transactions member and therefore its mutex also serializes operations on _transactions . "
With the proper annotations in place , the compiler could verify that _transactions is entirely encapsulated inside BankAccount and therefore can be safely used without worrying about undue sharing .
Systems and languages that do that have been proposed [ 25 , 2 , 11 , 6 ] but for the time being they are not mainstream .
Such ownership systems introduce significant complications in the language and its compiler .
With lock - based synchronization as a whole coming under attack , D shunned beefing up support for an ailing programming technique .
It is not impossible that the issue might be revisited later ( ownership systems have been proposed for D [ 42 ] ) , but for the time being certain lock - based designs must step outside the confines of the type system , as discussed next .
13.14.3 Forcing Identical Mutexes
D allows dynamically what the type system is unable to guarantee statically : an owner - owned relationship in terms of locking .
The following global primitive function is accessible :
// Inside object.d setSameMutex ( shared Object ownee , shared Object owner ) ;
A class object obj may call obj.setMutex ( owner ) to effectively throw away its associated synchronization object and start using the same synchronization object as owner .
That way you can be sure that locking owner really locks obj , too .
Let 's see how that would work with the BankAccount and the List .
// Thread - aware synchronized class List ( T ) { ... void append ( T value ) { ... } } // Keeps a List of transactions synchronized class BankAccount { private double _balance ; private List ! double _transactions ; this ( ) { //
The account owns the list setSameMutex ( _transactions , this ) ; } ... }
The way the scheme works requires that List ( the owned object ) be synchronized .
Subsequent operations on _transactions would lock the _transactions field per the normal rules , but in fact they go ahead and acquire BankAccount object 's mutex directly .
That way the compiler is happy because it thinks every object is locked in separation .
Also , the program is happy because in fact only one mutex controls the BankAccount and also the List subobject .
Acquiring the mutex of _transactions is in reality acquiring the already locked mutex of this .
Fortunately , such a recursive acquisition of an already owned , uncontested lock is relatively cheap , so the code is correct and not too locking - intensive .
13.14.4 The Unthinkable : cast ing Away shared
Continuing the preceding example , if you are absolutely positive that the _transactions list is completely private to the BankAccount object , you can cast away shared and use it without any regard to threads like this :
// Not synchronized and generally thread - agnostic class List ( T ) { ... void append ( T value ) { ... } } synchronized class BankAccount { private double _balance ; private List ! double _transactions ; void deposit ( double amount ) { _balance += amount ; ( cast ( List ! double ) _transactions ) .
append ( amount ) ; } void withdraw ( double amount ) { enforce ( _balance >= amount ) ; _balance -= amount ; ( cast ( List ! double ) _transactions ) .
append ( - amount ) ; } double balance ( ) { return _balance ; } }
Now the code does compile and run .
The only caveat is that now correctness of the lock - based discipline in the program is ensured by you , not by the language 's type system , so you 're not much better off than with languages that use default sharing .
The advantage you are still enjoying is that cast s are localized and can be searched for and carefully reviewed .
13.15 Deadlocks and the synchronized Statement
If the bank account example is the " Hello , world ! " of threaded programs , the bank account transfer example must be the corresponding ( if grimmer ) introduction to threads that deadlock .
The example goes like this : Assume you have two BankAccount objects , say , checking and savings .
The challenge is to define an atomic transfer of some money from one account to another .
The naïve approach goes like this :
// Transfer version 1 : non-atomic void transfer ( shared BankAccount source , shared BankAccount target , double amount ) { source.withdraw ( amount ) ; target.deposit( amount ) ; }
This version is not atomic , however ; between the two calls there is a quantum of time when money is missing from both accounts .
If just at that time a thread executes the inspectForAuditing function , things may get a little tense .
To make the transfer atomic , you need to acquire the hidden mutexes of the two objects outside their methods , at the beginning of transfer .
You can effect that with the help of synchronized statements :
// Transfer version 2 : PROBLEMATIC void transfer ( shared BankAccount source , shared BankAccount target , double amount ) { synchronized ( source ) { synchronized ( target ) { source.withdraw ( amount ) ; target.deposit( amount ) ; } } }
The synchronized statement acquires an object 's hidden mutex through the execution of the statement 's body .
Any method call against that object benefits from an already acquired lock .
The problem with the second version of transfer is that it 's prone to deadlock : if two threads attempt to execute a transfer between the same accounts but in opposite directions , the threads may block forever .
A thread attempting to transfer money from checking to savings locks checking exactly as another thread attempting to transfer money from savings to checking manages to lock savings .
At that point , each thread holds a lock , and each thread needs the other thread 's lock .
They will never work out an understanding .
To really fix the problem , you need to use synchronized with two arguments :
// Transfer version 3 : correct void transfer ( shared BankAccount source , shared BankAccount target , double amount ) { synchronized ( source , target ) { source.withdraw ( amount ) ; target.deposit( amount ) ; } }
Synchronizing on several objects in the same synchronized statement is different from successively synchronizing on each .
The generated code always acquires mutexes in the same order in all threads , regardless of the syntactic order in which you specify the objects .
That way , deadlock is averted .
The actual order in the reference implementation is the increasing order of object addresses .
Any global ordering would work just as well .
Multi-argument synchronized is helpful but , unfortunately , not a panacea .
General deadlock may occur non-locally — one mutex is acquired in one function , then another in a different function , and so on , until a deadlock cycle closes .
But synchronized with multiple arguments raises awareness of the issue and fosters correct code with modular mutex acquisition .
13.16 Lock - Free Coding with shared class es
The theory of lock - based synchronization was established in the 1960s .
As early as 1972 [ 23 ] , researchers started making inroads toward avoiding the slow , ham - fisted mutexes as much as possible in multithreaded programs .
For example , some types were assignable atomically so people reckoned there was no ostensible need to guard such assignments with mutex acquisition .
Also , some processors offered more advanced lightweight interlocked instructions such as atomic increment or test - and - set .
About three decades later , in 1990 , there was a definite beam of hope that some clever combination of atomic read - write registers could help avoid the tyranny of locks .
At that point , a seminal piece of work had the last word in a line of work and the first word in another .
Herlihy 's 1991 paper " Wait - free synchronization " [ 31 ] marked an absolutely powerful development in concurrent programming .
Prior to that , it was unclear to hardware and software developers alike what kind of synchronization primitives would be best to work with .
For example , a processor with atomic reads and writes for int s could intuitively be considered less powerful than one that also offers atomic += .
It may appear that one that offers atomic *= is even better ; generally , the more atomic primitives one has at one 's disposal , the merrier .
Herlihy blew that theory out of the water and in particular has shown that certain seemingly powerful synchronization primitives , such as test - and - set , fetch - and - add , and even one global shared FIFO queue , are virtually useless .
These impossibility results were proven clearly enough to instantly disabuse anyone of the illusion that such mechanisms could provide the magic concurrency potion .
Fortunately , Herlihy has also proved universality results — certain synchronization primitives may theoretically synchronize an infinite number of concurrent threads .
Remarkably , the " good " primitives are not more difficult to implement than the " bad " ones and do n't look particularly powerful to the naked eye .
Of the useful synchronization primitives , one known as compare - and - swap has caught on and is implemented today by virtually all processors .
Compare - and - swap has the following semantics :
// This function executes atomically bool cas( T ) ( shared ( T ) * here , shared ( T ) if This , shared ( T ) writeThis ) { if ( * here == if This ) { * here = write
This ; return true ; } return false ; }
In plain language , cas atomically compares a memory location with a given value , and if the location is equal to that value , it stores a new value ; otherwise , it does nothing .
The result of the operation tells whether the store took place .
The entire cas operation is atomic and must be provided as a primitive .
The set of possible T s is limited to integers of the native word size of the host machine ( i.e. , 32 or 64 bits ) .
An increasing number of machines offer double - word compare - and - swap , sometimes dubbed cas2 .
That operation atomically manipulates 64 - bit data on a 32 - bit machine and 128 - bit data on a 64 - bit machine .
In view of the increasing support for cas2 on contemporary machines , D offers double - word compare - and - swap under the same name ( cas ) as an overloaded intrinsic function .
So in D you can cas values of types int , long , float , double , all arrays , all pointers , and all class references .
13.16.1 shared class es
Following Herlihy 's universality proofs , many data structures and algorithms took off around the nascent " cas - based programming . "
Now , if a cas - based implementation is possible for theoretically any synchronization problem , nobody has said it 's easy .
Defining cas - based data structures and algorithms , and particularly proving that they work correctly , is a difficult feat .
Fortunately , once such an entity is defined and encapsulated , it can be reused to the benefit of many [ 57 ] .
To tap into cas - based lock - free goodness , use the shared attribute with a class or struct definition :
shared struct LockFreeStruct { ... } shared class LockFreeClass { ... }
The usual transitivity rules apply : shared propagates to the fields of the struct or class , and methods offer no special protection .
All you can count on are atomic assignments , cas calls , the guarantee that the compiler and machine wo n't do any reordering of operations , and your unbridled confidence .
But be warned — if coding were walking and message passing were jogging , lock - free programming would be no less than the Olympics .
13.16.2 A Couple of Lock - Free Structures
As a warmup exercise , let 's implement a lock - free stack type .
The basic idea is simple : the stack is maintained as a singly linked list , and insertions as well as removals proceed at the front of the list :
shared struct Stack ( T ) { private shared struct Node { T _payload ; Node * _next ; } private Node * _root ; void push ( T value ) { auto n = new Node ( value ) ; shared ( Node ) * oldRoot ; do { oldRoot = _root ; n._next = oldRoot ; } while (! cas ( &_root , oldRoot , n ) ) ; } shared ( T ) * pop ( ) { typeof ( return ) result ; shared ( Node ) * oldRoot ; do { oldRoot = _root ; if ( ! oldRoot ) return null ; result = & oldRoot .
_payload ; } while ( ! cas( &_root , oldRoot , oldRoot._next ) ) ; return result ; } }
Stack is a shared struct , and as a direct consequence pretty much everything inside of it is also shared .
The internal type Node has the classic payload - and - pointer structure , and the Stack itself stores the root of the list .
The do / while loops in the two primitives may look a bit odd , but they are very common ; slowly but surely , they dig a deep groove in the cortex of every cas - based programming expert - to - be .
The way push works is to first create a new Node that will store the new value .
Then , in a loop , _root is assigned the pointer to the new node , but only if in the meantime no other thread has changed it !
It 's quite possible that another thread has also performed a stack operation , so push needs to make sure that the root assumed in oldRoot has not changed while the new node was being primed .
The pop method does not return by value , but instead by pointer .
This is because pop may find the queue empty , which is not an exceptional condition ( as it would be in a single - threaded stack ) .
For a shared stack , checking for an element , removing it , and returning it are one organic operation .
Aside from the return aspect , pop is similar in the implementation to push : _root is replaced with care such that no other thread changes it while the payload is being fetched .
At the end of the loop , the extracted value is off the stack and can be safely returned to its caller .
If Stack did n't seem that complicated , let 's look at actually exposing a richer singly linked interface ; after all , most of the infrastructure is built inside Stack already .
Unfortunately , for a list things are bound to become more difficult .
How much more difficult ?
Brutally more difficult .
One fundamental problem is insertion and deletion of nodes at arbitrary positions in the list .
Say we have a list of int containing a node with payload 5 followed by a node with payload 10 , and we want to remove the 5 node .
No problem here — just do the cas magic to swing _root to point to the 10 node .
The problem is , if at the same time another thread inserts a new node right after the 5 node , that node will be irretrievably lost : _root knows nothing about it .
Several solutions exist in the literature ; none of them is trivially simple .
The implementation described below , first proposed by Harris [ 30 ] in the suggestively entitled paper " A pragmatic implementation of non-blocking linked - lists , " has a hackish flavor to it because it relies on setting the unused least significant bit of the _next pointer .
The idea is first to mark that pointer as " logically deleted " by setting its bit to zero , and then to excise the node entirely in a second step :
shared struct SharedList ( T ) { shared struct Node { private T _payload ; private Node * _next ; @property shared ( Node ) * next ( ) { return clearls b ( _next ) ; } bool removeAfter ( ) { shared ( Node ) * thisNext , afterNext ; // Step 1 : set the lsb of _next for the node to delete do { this Next = next ; if ( ! thisNext ) return false ; afterNext = this Next.next ; } while ( ! cas(&thisNext._next , afterNext , setlsb( afterNext ) ) ) ; // Step 2 : excise the node to delete if ( ! cas ( &_next , this Next , afterNext ) ) { afterNext = this Next.
_next ; while ( !haslsb( afterNext ) ) { this Next.
_next = this Next._next.next ; } _next = afterNext ; } } void insertAfter ( T value ) { auto newNode = new Node ( value ) ; for ( ; ; ) { //
Attempt to find an insertion point auto n = _next ; while ( n && haslsb ( n ) ) { n = n._next ; } //
Found a possible insertion point , attempt insert auto afterN = n._next ; newNode .
_next = afterN ; if ( cas ( &n._next , afterN , newNode ) ) { break ; } } } } private Node * _root ; void pushFront ( T value ) { ... //
Same as for Stack . push } shared ( T ) * popFront ( ) { ... //
Same as for Stack.pop } }
The implementation is tricky but can be understood if you keep in mind a couple of invariants .
First , it 's OK for logically deleted nodes ( i.e. , Node objects with the field _next having its least significant bit set ) to hang around for a little bit .
Second , a node is never inserted after a logically deleted node .
That way , the list stays coherent even though nodes may appear and disappear at any time .
The implementation of clearlsb , setlsb and haslsb is as barbaric as it gets ; for example :
T* setlsb ( T ) ( T* p ) { return cast ( T*) ( cast ( size_t ) p | 1 ) ; }

The implementation of setlsb , dirty and leaking some grease at the seams , is a fitting finale for a chapter that has started with the simple beauty of message passing and has gradually descended into the underworld of sharing .
D has an ample offering of threading amenities .
For most applications on modern machines , the preferred mechanism is defining protocols built around message passing .
Immutable sharing should be of great help there .
You'd be well advised to use message passing for defining robust , scalable concurrent applications .

A landscaper who worked for
family at their rural Northwest Portland home told authorities that the missing boy 's stepmom offered to pay him to kill her husband .
The landscaper told authorities that
approached him with the murder - for - hire plot six to seven months before Kyron disappeared , The Oregonian has learned .
She reportedly offered the landscaper , who advertises his expertise in lawn care , a large sum of money to carry out the scheme , sources say .
Detectives with the Multnomah County Major Crimes
Team shared the landscaper 's account with Kyron 's father , Kaine Horman , last weekend , prompting him to leave the house June 26 with the couple 's 19 - month - old daughter .
Within two days , he obtained a family law attorney and filed divorce papers and a petition for a restraining order under the Family Abuse Prevention Act .

Investigators also recorded a conversation June 26 among the cooperating landscaper , Terri Horman and an undercover law enforcement officer , but Horman shut down the conversation fairly quickly , sources said .
Detectives later confronted Terri Horman directly with the murder - for - hire allegation , which she denied , sources say .
She has not been charged with a crime , as a criminal investigation proceeds .
Terri Horman retained prominent criminal defense lawyer Stephen Houze on Wednesday .
Repeated attempts to reach Houze , who was on the East Coast , were unsuccessful .
A woman who answered the door at Terri Horman 's house Saturday referred questions to her attorney .
Laura Rackner , Kaine Horman 's attorney , declined to comment Saturday night other than to say : " I just want to do whatever is going to help law enforcement right now . "
After Kyron disappeared June 4 , investigators with the county 's Major Crimes Team tracked down the landscaper in the course of trying to interview everyone who had contact with the boy 's family .
They also found it odd that Terri Horman had hired a landscaper without her husband 's knowledge .
The landscaper , contacted by The Oregonian last week , confirmed that he was hired to do lawn work at the Horman home off Northwest Sheltered Nook Road .
He said he 's talked with detectives and could not comment further .
His name is being withheld to protect his identity as a cooperating witness in an ongoing criminal investigation .
Detectives last weekend also shared the information they developed about the alleged murder - for - hire scheme with Kyron 's mother and stepdad , Desiree and Tony Young -- providing a clearer indication of why the two banded together with Kaine Horman and the three suddenly and publicly distanced themselves from Terri Horman .
On Thursday , Desiree Young , with Kyron 's dad and her husband standing behind her , made an emotional plea to Terri Horman before television cameras -- the family 's first public statements directed at Kyron 's stepmom since the boy disappeared a month ago .
" We implore Terri Horman to fully cooperate with investigators to bring Kyron home , " a shaken Young told the media .
Investigators said Terri Horman was the last known person to see Kyron , when she told authorities she left him about 8:45 a.m. June 4 at Skyline School .
She snapped a photo of the second - grader wearing a " CSI " T - shirt and beaming a smile beside his science fair exhibit earlier and posted it that day on her Facebook page .
She and her husband waited for Kyron at the school bus stop not far from their home that afternoon , and when he did n't get off the bus , they went to the school .
The school had n't contacted the family when Kyron did n't return to his classroom after the science fair .
A large - scale search ensued , with law enforcement and search - and - rescue agencies from across the state , California and Washington combing the expansive hills around Kyron 's home and school for days .
Though the sheriff 's office has consistently declined to say whether Terri Horman is a suspect or even a person of interest in the case , investigators have intently focused on her the past several weeks .
She was grilled for hours through two polygraph exams , friends and family said .
Sources said there were indications of deception during her first polygraph and gaps in the timeline she gave investigators the day Kyron disappeared .
Authorities released a flier and questionnaire June 18 featuring photos of Terri Horman and a white truck similar to the one she was driving when she took Kyron to school , asking whether anyone had seen either on June 4 .
Last weekend , at 5:17 p.m. June 26 , Terri Horman placed a 9 - 1 - 1 call , classified as a " threats " call , to Multnomah County dispatchers , and a sheriff 's deputy responded .
By 11:39 p.m. , when her husband and her 19 - month - old daughter had n't returned home , Terri Horman placed another 9 - 1 - 1 call , one classified by dispatchers as a " custody " matter .
Kaine Horman was n't at the home when either call was placed , sources said .
The sheriff 's office has declined to allow the release of the 9 - 1 - 1 tapes .
Two nights later , about 6 p.m. Monday , Terri Horman was served the restraining order and divorce papers at her home .
About 45 minutes earlier , she had denied to an Oregonian reporter who came to her door that her husband had moved out .
She gave a thumbs up , saying , " Everything 's good . "
A judge grants a restraining order if the petitioner can show that the petitioner or child is in " imminent danger of further abuse " by the respondent , and the respondent represents a " credible threat to the physical safety of petitioner or petitioner 's child . "
Oregonian reporter Bryan Denson and news researcher Lynne Palombo contributed to this story .

Gardeners , much like Blanche DuBois in " A Streetcar Named Desire , " can count on the kindness of strangers .
The strangers in this case were a half - dozen botanists .
The kindness was answering a question :
What is the term for the small pepper that sometimes grows inside a bell pepper ?
And what causes it ?
I searched the library and the Web before I sought help , so it made me feel better when most of the experts came up empty - handed .
The answer eventually came from John Stommel , a researcher in the Genetic Improvement of Fruits and Vegetables Laboratory of the USDA ’s Agricultural Research Service .
Dr. Stommel is located in Beltsville , Md , , the mother ship of the ARS , but the service has units located from coast to coast that carry out thousands of research projects about everything agricultural , both floral and faunal .
Readable summaries of their technical research appear in the monthly Agricultural Research magazine , which you can access online .
Bur back to peppers in peppers .
There appears to be nothing published on the subject in the past 50 years other than an article written by three University of California scientists in 1966 .
That little pepper inside a bigger pepper is called an “ internal proliferation . ”
Its form can vary from irregular and contorted to a near - perfect but sterile fruit .
A pepper growing inside a pepper is a type of parthenocarpy , which is the formation of fruits without fertilization or the formation of seeds .
No one is sure what causes them , but temperature and nutrient levels have been ruled out .
Plant breeders , who consider this anomaly undesirable , keep an eye out for it when selecting for new cultivars , because the trait is inheritable .
So I received no definitive answers about why there are peppers in peppers , but had one definitive discovery : Busy scientists are willing to pause while fine mapping the tomato beta - modifier gene , as Dr. Stommel did , and answer oddball questions from the public .
For the record , an internal proliferation is as edible as its Capsicum container .
I think of it as getting a second pepper for free .

COLUMBUS , Ohio – Environmental preservationists hope a U.S. Supreme Court ruling this week will increase the public 's ownership along Lake Erie 's shoreline -- an issue currently in front of Ohio 's highest court .
The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled that a Florida state beach restoration program did not violate the rights of waterfront property owners .
Environmentalists in Ohio viewed the decision as a victory because it placed protection of the coastline above individual property rights .
" This could send some important political shock waves , " said Jack Shaner , deputy director of the Ohio Environmental Council .
" The Ohio Supreme Court , we hope , will pay attention to what the U.S. Supreme Court said . "
Others , however , say the U.S. Supreme Court 's ruling is irrelevant .
State Sen . Tim Grendell , who has been an advocate for personal property rights , said the ruling applies only to ocean waters , which are legally known as " tidal " waters .
" The same rules do n't apply to non-tidal waters like Lake Erie , " Grendell , a Republican from Chester Township , said .
At stake in the case before the Ohio Supreme Court are the rights of lakefront property owners who say the property boundary is the water 's edge .
A group of those property owners sued the state because it had tried to place the boundary at a high - water level determined more than two decades ago .
Under former Gov. Bob Taft , the Ohio Department of Natural Resources began charging lakefront property owners a lease to place docks out into the waters of Lake Erie .
That practice prompted the lawsuit .
The boundary the state wanted to use would move the property ownership line into people 's backyards , a lawyer for the landowners said .
Those landowners won a partial victory in 2007 when a Lake County judge decided the Lake Erie shoreline is the boundary separating public and private property .
Judge Eugene Lucci said the state could have unjustly taken private land without compensation if the high water mark boundary had been used .
An appeals court upheld the decision last August .
The state appealed the decision , and the Ohio Supreme Court agreed to hear the case .
A decision is months away , said a spokeswoman for Attorney General Richard Cordray , who is representing the state .
Shaner , whose organization is a co-defendant with the state in the case , said the previous rulings are out of touch with mainstream thinking .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruling could change that , he said .
The Florida case stemmed from a project to restore beaches in Florida that had been damaged by hurricanes .
The government wanted to add 75 feet of sand to counter the erosion of the beaches .
Nearby property owners argued the restoration project infringed their property rights .
The Supreme Court disagreed .
Trent Dougherty , a staff attorney for the Ohio Environmental Council , said the ruling this week put a spotlight on the importance of maintaining a healthy coast along Lake Erie .
" To protect the coast for 11 million outweighs the property rights of one person , " Dougherty said .
One of the most striking examples of our brain 's capacity to subconsciously process visual input is the phenomenon called " blindsight . "
Individuals with damage to the primary visual cortex are effectively blind — they 're not consciously aware of objects in their visual field .
But , remarkably , they remain capable of navigating around obstacles they can't actually " see . "
Now , research with other primates has started to untangle the pathways that enable this blindsight ability .
A paper describing the findings will appear in today 's issue of Nature .
The authors describe how the primary visual cortex , V1 , is largely responsible for processing focus - driven visual information .
In both humans and other animals , loss of this area leaves the brain consciously unaware of visual information ; smaller lesions may leave similar deficits for a subset of the visual field .
But there are a number of other areas of the brain that appear to be active in processing visual information ( V2 through V5 have been identified ) , and it 's possible that these contribute to the blindsight phenomenon .
The authors worked with two macaques that have small lesions in their primary visual cortexes , which leave them unable to respond to visual cues in a subset of their visual field .
A fair amount of work went in to defining precisely the areas within the visual field that were no longer effective , and confirming that stimuli in those areas could still induce activity ( measured via functional MRI ) in the remaining visual cortexes .
The authors then focused on a structure called the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) , which acts as a relay point for signals travelling between the retina and the primary visual cortex .
Other work had shown that the LGN also has projections to a number of secondary visual areas , suggesting that it may serve as a major hub in the visual system .
To test this suggestion , the authors injected the LGN with a chemical that activates the receptor for a major inhibitory signaling molecule ( the chemical , THIP , is what 's termed a " GABAA - receptor agonist " ) .
When the chemical is present , nerve cells receive a signal telling them to stop signaling , so this this injection has the effect of shutting the LGN down entirely .
The treatment was highly effective .
With the LGN shut down , visual stimuli that normally induce a blindsight response did n't elicit any response from the visual centers of the macaques .
Although blindsight is a ( fortunately ) rare condition , this finding will ultimately help us understand how a single input , originating in nerves that relay information from the retina , can be distributed to a number of areas in the brain simultaneously .
We may think the actions of the primary visual cortex are the most essential , but the mere phenomenon of blindsight — navigating around obstacles without expending the resources involved in consciousness to do so — provides just one indication of the importance of the other functions .

I 'm powering through the ending of the smashing , enormous first volume of the first major authorized biography of Robert A Heinlein : Robert A Heinlein : In Dialogue With His Century , Volume 1 : Learning Curve ( 1907 - 1948 ) and I 've just been poleaxed by this quote , which absolutely sums up the way that I approach stories : " My notion of a story is an interesting situation in which a human being has to cope with a problem , does so , and thereby changed his personality , character , or evaluations in some measure because the coping has forced him to revise his thinking .
How he copes with it , I can't plot in advance because that depends on his character , and I do n't know what his character is until I get acquainted with him . "
Starting consumer protection right
My worry is n't that the Obama administration will pass over Elizabeth Warren at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and appoint " some banker " instead .
My worry is that they 'll pass over Warren and choose some gray bureaucrat or friendly ex-congressman instead .
A crusty banker who hates a lot of his former colleagues and has the cutthroat , ruthless personality of lots of bankers might be able to attract other ex-Wall Street types and create an interesting agency .
Some former bureaucrat can't .
As I argued in this column , when you 're creating a new institution , you need to think about creating path dependence among the staff .
To simplify a bit , if you get good people in the first place , you 'll keep getting good people after that .
If not , not .
The argument for Warren is that the best young lawyers and consumer advocates revere her and would walk across glass for the opportunity to work with her .
There 's no second choice with anything close to that allure .
I 'm unsurprised that the administration is conflicted on appointing her , however .
A lot of economists -- both inside and outside the administration -- think she 's too dismissive of the benefits of financial innovation .
Business would lose their minds over the appointment .
It 'd be a tough sell in the Senate .
Of course , this was always what the CFPB was supposed to be about :
An independent agency housed inside the Federal Reserve so there 's a pro-consumer voice to battle it out with the Fed's -- and the rest of the regulatory system 's -- natural bent toward banks and financial products .
The case against Warren , in other words , boils down to ambivalence toward the idea of the CFPB .
Which makes sense , as it's her idea .
That 's fair enough , but I 'd much rather start by making the CFPB strong and ratcheting it back if necessary than ratcheting it back at the start and pretending we can make it stronger if we need to do so in the future .

A US army intelligence analyst was today charged with leaking a highly classified video of American forces killing unarmed civilians in Baghdad and secret diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks .
Private Bradley Manning , who had a top - secret security clearance , has been held in military custody in Kuwait since his arrest in Iraq in May over the video , which caused great embarrassment to the US military establishment .
It showed an air strike that killed a dozen people , including two Iraqis working for Reuters news agency .
The air crew is heard falsely claiming to have encountered a firefight in Baghdad and then laughing at the dead .
WikiLeaks gave the video the title Collateral Murder .
Manning , 22 , was arrested after boasting in instant messages and emails to a high - profile former hacker , Adrian Lamo , that he passed the material to WikiLeaks along with thousands of pages of confidential American diplomatic cables .
WikiLeaks has since said it plans to release a second US military video that shows one of the deadliest US air strikes in Afghanistan , in which scores of children were believed to have been killed .
The site 's founder , Julian Assange , said the organisation was still working to prepare the encrypted film of the bombing of the Afghan village of Garani in May 2009 , in which the Afghan government said about 140 civilians died , including 92 children .
The Baghdad video shows one of two US Apache helicopter crews falsely claiming that there is shooting , opening fire and then laughing over the dead .
The helicopters also attack a van attempting to rescue the wounded .
One of them opens fire with armour - piercing shells .
One of the crew laughs about the attack after the windscreen is blown out .
Behind it were two children who were wounded .
Manning faces two charges under military law for allegedly illegally transferring the Iraq video and copies of documents to his computer and then for passing " national defence information to an unauthorised source " .
The charge sheet says Manning leaked the material to " bring discredit upon the armed forces " .
Although WikiLeaks has not formally acknowledged that Manning is the source of the material it has retained three lawyers in the US to help defend him .
Lamo told Wired magazine that he went to the military and FBI about Manning " because lives were in danger " after the soldier also boasted of leaking thousands of pages of diplomatic cables .
Manning told Lamo that he contacted Assange because what he saw in the Baghdad video disturbed him .
" At first glance it was just a bunch of guys getting shot up by a helicopter , " Manning wrote .
" No big deal … about two dozen more where that came from , right ?
But something struck me as odd with the van thing , and also the fact it was being stored in a Jag ( judge advocate general ) officer 's directory .
So I looked into it . "
Manning gave the video to WikiLeaks in February .
The site made it public two months later after breaking the encryption .
Lamo said that what disturbed him was a boast by Manning that he had sent 260,000 pages of confidential diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks .
" Hillary Clinton , and several thousand diplomats around the world , are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning , and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available , in searchable format , to the public , " Manning is said to have written .
Lamo said he met military investigators and the FBI because he feared the leak of diplomatic cables endangered US security .
Lamo told Wired : " He was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as he could , and just throwing it up into the air . "

Mike Allen reports in his " White House Mindmeld " today that Obama is settling into a " choice election " strategy for November ( i.e. , trying to make it as much about the other guys as you ) rather than a " referendum election " strategy ( i.e. , making it solely about you ) :
The President used his remarks in Missouri to frame the November elections as a choice between the economic policies that led us into this mess and the policies that are leading us out – a theme you ’ll hear a lot of in the coming four months .
Setting aside the fact that this is almost always the strategy employed by incumbents when times are tough ( see " George W. Bush , re-election of " ) it strikes me as a particularly good approach this time out .
All the more so if one of the choices is going to be the previous period of Republican rule , as seems to be the case .
Consider this June NBC / Wall Street Journal poll .
The Democrats ' numbers certainly are n't great ( though maybe not as dire as you 'd think : Obama 's job approval / disapproval number is at 45 - 48 , down from 48 - 45 in May ; people have positive feelings toward him personally by a 47 - 40 margin .
And voters prefer GOP to Democratic control of Congress by a 45 - 43 margin , about the same place it stood in May ) .
But George W. Bush 's numbers are absolutely abysmal .
The same poll shows that about half as many people have positive feelings toward Bush as negative feelings ( 29 - 50 ) .
It shows that many more people hold Bush either " solely " or " mainly " responsible for the lousy economy as Obama ( 40 percent for Bush , 27 percent for Obama ) .
And then there 's this interesting question about factors that would make a voter either enthusiastic / comfortable with a candidate for Congress , or give them pause about that candidate .
If the candidate were endorsed by Obama , 36 percent of voters would be enthusiastic or comfortable with this fact , while 43 percent would either have reservations or be uncomfortable .
Now compare that with " supported the economic policies of George W. Bush . "
Twenty - three percent of voters say they'd be enthusiastic or comfortable with a candidate who fit this description , while 62 percent would have reservations or be uncomfortable with such a candidate .
If that 's not grounds for framing this as a choice election , I do n't know what is .
Nearly four weeks into the fiscal year without a budget , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger suggested Monday that California might have to wait until his successor is sworn in next year to get a spending plan — unless lawmakers give him everything he wants .
Schwarzenegger has said the Legislature must curtail public pensions and change California ’s taxation and budgeting systems before he will sign the next budget , his last as governor .
He leaves office in January .
“ If I do not get all of the things that we need … I will not sign a budget , and it could actually drag out until the next governor gets into office , ” Schwarzenegger told reporters after an event at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce , according to a recording provided by his office .
Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D- Sacramento ) responded in a statement Monday that he was “ prepared to grant his wish ” if Schwarzenegger “ continues to insist on granting billions in corporate tax cuts financed by drastic cuts to public education and programs for working mothers and their children . ”
The state faces a $ 19.1 - billion deficit for the fiscal year that began July 1 .
Rank - and - file lawmakers went on recess weeks ago as talks between top lawmakers and the governor showed little progress .
Schwarzenegger blamed them for the tardy spending plan , saying they “ go on vacation . ”
Lawmakers are set to return to the Capitol next week .
Schwarzenegger also said Monday that he opposes giving legislators the power to pass a budget with a simple - majority vote , or any proposal that would make it easier to raise taxes or fees .
“ I even do n’t believe in doing the budget ” by majority vote , he said .
Schwarzenegger said lowering the vote threshold would ensure that “ one party will make all the decisions ” in Sacramento .
Voters will decide on such a plan in November .
Proposition 25 would change the two - thirds vote requirement to a simple majority vote for passing budgets but maintain a supermajority threshold to raise taxes .
The measure is backed by labor unions and other Democratic groups and opposed by the state Chamber of Commerce .

Meg Whitman says the disastrous oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has caused her to change her position on offshore oil drilling in California , adding that she no longer is certain technology can make it safe .
“ Right now , I ’m a ‘ no ’ on offshore oil drilling , ” Whitman told Calbuzz .
In an interview on Thursday , the front - runner for the Republican nomination for governor said the economic and environmental damage inflicted by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon and the huge gush of undersea oil that has followed convinced her to shift her stance on drilling off the coast of California .
Again .
Last year , she stated that she began her campaign for governor as an opponent of drilling off the coast , but subsequently learned more about new technologies , which she had come to believe all but eliminated the risks of offshore extraction : ” When I started this process , I was against offshore oil drilling , and then I began to understand deeply the new technology that is available to extract oil from existing wells , ” she said last summer .
But in this week ’s interview with Calbuzz , Whitman said she has changed that position :
Historically I was against offshore oil drilling , but I am the living example of someone who believes technology can enable you to do things you ’d never dream you could do .
So I wanted to look into slant drilling … and convene a group to say , you know , ‘ is this possible to do with zero to minimal environmental risk ? ’
I will say what has happened in Louisiana I think has raised the bar on what , you know , technology is going to be able to have to do , and what we can assure ourselves of .
Because , gosh , you look at what has happened in the Gulf , the economic devastation of the shrimpers , the fishermen .
I mean you ’re starting to see it now go on the north shore of the coast of Florida there , the hospitality industry is at risk .
So I think it has absolutely raised the bar in terms of what we would need to feel comfortable with to go forward .
So right now , I ’m a no on offshore oil drilling .
Following a town hall meeting in Santa Barbara , Whitman in our interview also discussed several other key issues :
Taxes – A Public Policy Institute of California poll released Wednesday included new data on how voters feel about taxes : 62 % of those surveyed said they would favor a state income tax increase for the wealthiest people in California ; 58 % said they would support higher taxes on corporations ; solid majorities said they would consider a tax increase to pay for K - 12 education ( 69 % ) , higher education ( 54 % ) and health and human services ( 54 % ) .
“ It does n’t influence my thinking , ” Whitman answered , when asked whether such majority views would affect her policies as governor .
“ My view is we should not be raising taxes on anyone in California . ”
Asked what she would say to parents of students at public schools that are losing teachers and small class size programs , and who are willing to pay higher taxes for schools , she added :
I ’d say we have a philosophical disagreement on how to right the economy in California … I mean , I do n’t think people really do understand that a 12.6 percent unemployment rate not only has tax revenues decreasing , it has costs going through the roof .
It ’s the worst of all possible worlds – you ’ve got a financial pincer – revenues going down and costs going up so we ’ve got to get Californians back to work and then we ’ve got to eliminate another $ 15 billion of costs out of that budget .
Spending –
The $ 15 billion figure is what Whitman claims , with slim evidence , can be rooted out in “ waste , fraud and abuse ” in state government , a task she has said she will assign a “ statewide grand jury ” to investigate .
She acknowledged in the interview that she would need the support of the Legislature to pass a measure to authorize such a body , which she said should contain 18 members .
She offered this elaboration :
We ’d fill those 18 spots from the grand jury pool in the 58 counties that have a fully vetted grand jury pool , and then this grand jury would be convened .
The Inspector General * would identify issues of fraud and waste and abuse .
Serve some of that up to the grand jury who would then have the power to indict and subpoena .
Immigration – Last year , Whitman said during a visit to the California - Mexico border that illegal immigrants “ should do some things that would ultimately allow a path to legalization . ”
GOP rival Steve Poizner has used her comment to portray eMeg as a supporter of amnesty for illegals ; “ path to legalization ” is a phrase used by supporters of comprehensive immigration reform which opponents say is code for “ amnesty . ”
Confronted with her earlier statement , Whitman insisted she was not signaling support for amnesty , offering this explanation :
In my view , that was not a statement in support of amnesty …
What I was referring to , which has been taken out of context , is I was referring to a guest worker program , I was talking about agriculture ; that we had to find a way to have a stable work force for agriculture , and that I have never been for amnesty , I was not for amnesty at the time and you know ( Poizner ) has chosen to jump on this issue .
Poizner – Whitman had harsh words for her Republican foe , whom she accused of twisting her words :
As you know , Steve Poizner has not been on the illegal immigration issue before about six weeks ago .**
I mean , this is sheer political opportunism .
He has not been to the border as a candidate until six weeks ago , he never talked about this as insurance commissioner , in fact he was on the other side of this issue when he ran for Assembly ( in 2004 ) , he was in fact in favor of ( former President )
Bush ’s comprehensive immigration reform , which many people thought had amnesty in it .
so this is the classic case of someone willing to say or do anything to get elected .
* The Office of Inspector General , now held by Laura Chick , was created specifically to oversee the spending of federal stimulus funds in California .
Whitman ’s proposal would involve an expansion of those duties .
** Poizner first raised the issue of illegal immigration in a big way at the Republican state convention on March 12 , although he previously had discussed it in interviews .
For those of you who just want to see the code just hit the links .
OK , Real world problem I have a client who does business in the state of Texas .
Texas requires that on a monthly basis my client send them a report on pre-printed forms as to the state taxes they have collected .
In point of fact they not only have to collect state taxes , but city , county , and various other specialty taxes .
Without going into a great deal of detail I collect this information at a detail level on an order by order bases and transfer this detail into a MySQL database .
Then through various SQL queries create a summary table of the Texas State , City , County , etc taxes .
Each record contains the name of the taxing body , an ID number of the taxing body , the total dollar amount of all sales for the month , the tax percent and tax amount .
If you would like to see what this form looks like go to http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/taxforms/01-forms.html and select form no 01 - 116 .
I wanted to produce this report using python and after some Googling figured Reportlab was the tool to use .
After reading the documentation checking a few tutorials and a couple of false starts trying to use Platypus , I finally figured out the I would have to use the low - level functions of Canvas so I could have complete control of field placement on the forms that is what ‘ drawString ’ and its various incantations do .
I played around with the Hello World example and added a second field to the example just to get a feel for how this worked .
Figured out that the pagesize needed to be set to ‘ letter ’ for US and although units ( measurements used for X and Y coordinate ) could be set to inch or cm using the default point of 1/72 of inch or 72 point per inch gave me greater control especially for accurate vertical spacing .
For you newbie programmers and newbies to python , the code below is the very first draft of the program and is crap .
Like you , although I have been programming for years I am new to python and I do n’t automatically think in higher concepts of the language yet .
The program creates the following report ;
Texas_Tax_Rpt.pdf
Now for the real job of programmer refactoring your code .
I actually did this in 5 additional steps to be exact and will list each .
Step 1 was actually writing the first draft above .
Step 2 was to rename my functions to more appropriate names ( vestiges of an old Cobol programmer ) , remove the line computations from the tax_detail function and to make the line computation more compact and non dependent on knowing the number of records in the file thus removing all of the page computation .
Also I removed the page summary total from the tax_detail function and gave it its own function .
texas_tax_rpt2.py
Step 3 , the only real changes here are I do n’t really like using index numbers for obtaining field elements , on a file this small it is probably not that big a deal but when working with file with a larger number of column it can get unruly .
In this version I just created my own column name and created a dictionary .
texas_tax_rpt3.py
Step 4 typing all those fields in using dictionary notation such as dict_rec [ ‘ sale_amt ’ ] is just to much strain on my little pinky so I created a class to create variable attributes such as tsr.sale_amt .
It also improves code readablity .
texas_tax_rpt4.py
Step 5 next came the realization of why should I create a set of column names when I already have column names in the database so why not use them .
So I shifted the col_name list under the SQL that fetched the data records and pulled the column names from the SQL table thus giving more consistance to the link between the MySQL table and report logic .
texas_tax_rpt5.py
Step 6 finally after reviewing the code I noticed that the code for printing the state tax total and the individual tax lines was really identical so I deleted the function for the state tax total and just used the tax detail code .
texas_tax_rpt6.py
Last thoughts for what it is worth , I thought about doing one more round turning the code into a more object oriented program but refrained because this is a very specific report and reuse of the report specifics is highly unlikely .
BP PLC and other big oil companies based their plans for responding to a big oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on U.S. government projections that gave very low odds of oil hitting shore , even in the case of a spill much larger than the current one .
The government models , which oil companies are required to use but have not been updated since 2004 , assumed that most of the oil would rapidly evaporate or get broken up by waves or weather .
In the weeks since the Deepwater Horizon caught fire and sank , real life has proven these ...
Steve Castle Character Information Gender Species Human Age Late 20s to mid 30s Height 5 ' 10 " Earth Earth Profession Planet Express ( Businessman ) Status Deceased Background Information First appearance Future Stock " Voiced by David Herman
“ Awesome .
Awesome to the max ! ” – Steve Castle in Future Stock
Steve Castle ( also known as That Guy ) ( born 1953 ) was a slick businessman who cryogenically froze himself during the 1980's because he suffered from Boneitis , a deadly disease .
When he was awoken around a thousand years later , he quickly became the chief executive officer of Planet Express .
By applying his 1980's Wall Street style to the company , he was able to grow it large enough to appear to be a threat to the dominant company in the delivery industry , Mom 's Friendly Delivery Company ( MomCorp ) .
Steve negotiated a merger with Mom , but died from boneitis before being able to close the deal .
He was apparently too busy being a " go - go 80 's business man " to remember to find a cure , or it may have been possible in 3002 a cure had yet to be discovered .
He was seen in " The Beast with a Billion Backs " working at Space Farm insurance even though two years earlier he had died .
It is unknown if this was a goof or if he found a cure for his disease in the nick of time .
Steve appears to resemble Gordon Gekko from the original Wall Street film .
film .
Steve and Fry met by chance in a cryogenic support group in which Fry 's original intention was to just eat all the free food .
He also appears in the episode " The Late Philip J. Fry " as Fry , Professor Farnsworth , and Bender were time traveling in the second existence .
NETHERLANDS vs DENMARK , Johannesburg , 14/06/10
The first UFWC title match in 12 years to take place at the FIFA World Cup will see the Netherlands defend their crown against fellow European qualifiers , Denmark .
The Netherlands have already had an incredible reign as UFWC champions , having defended the title 15 times in a row , the joint second - best record in UFWC history , tieing with Germany and beaten only by Scotland , who achieved 20 consecutive defences between 1880 and 1888 .
Having had an unbeaten World Cup qualifying campaign and a string of great results since then , the team will be high on confidence , but are yet to find out if Arjen Robben will be in the team or not , having suffered an unfortunate injury in their warm - up match with Hungary .
A scan later today will reveal whether he will be present in South Africa or not .
Unlike the Netherlands however , Denmark ’s form has stuttered recently .
Having qualified for the World Cup as winners of their qualification group , they seem to have lost their edge recently , having lost three of their last four matches , against Austria , Australia and South Africa .
Their last match in the UFWC was in 2008 , when they failed to defeat Hungary to claim the title as the match ended 0 - 0 .
They have won the UFWC title on three separate occasions ; the last time they held the title was in 1989 .
So who will triumph ?
Will the Netherlands continue their unbeaten streak , or will Denmark cause an upset to reclaim the title for the first time in 21 years ?
The odds suggest that it will be the Netherlands : they are 4/7 to win the match , and 1/12 to retain the title , while Denmark are 11/2 to claim the trophy .
One way or another , history will be made .
The question is , who will make it ?
Do n't pour that dirty fat from the frier down the sink - it could be used to make the fuel of the future .
Hydrogen has been tipped as a cleaner , greener alternative to fossil fuels .
But scientists have struggled to find a way to make it that does n't consume vast amounts of energy , use up scarce natural resources , or spew out high levels of greenhouse gas .
Researchers at the University of Leeds have now found an energy - efficient way to make hydrogen out of used vegetable oils discarded by restaurants , takeaways and pubs .
Not only does the process generate some of the energy needed to make the hydrogen gas itself , it is also essentially carbon - neutral .
" We are working towards a vision of the hydrogen economy , " said Dr Valerie Dupont , who is leading the Leeds - based project .
" Hydrogen - based fuel could potentially be used to run our cars or even drive larger scale power plants , generating the electricity we need to light our buildings , run our kettles and fridges , and power our computers .
But hydrogen does not occur naturally , it has to be made .
With this process , we can do that in a sustainable way by recycling waste materials , such as used cooking oil . "
Hydrogen can already be made quite easily from simple fossil fuels , such as natural gas .
The fuel is mixed with steam in the presence of a metal catalyst then heated to above 800 degrees centigrade to form hydrogen and carbon dioxide .
However when much more complex fuels are used , such as waste vegetable oil , it is difficult to make very much hydrogen using this method without raising the temperature even further .
The reactions could be run at lower temperatures but the catalysts would quickly become poisoned by residues left over from the dirty oil .
In short , the process is not only expensive but also environmentally unsound .
Dr Dupont and colleagues have perfected a two - stage process that is essentially self - heating .
To begin , the nickel catalyst is blasted with air to form nickel oxide - an ' exothermic ' process that can raise the starting temperature of 650 degrees by another 200 degrees .
The fuel and steam mixture then reacts with the hot nickel oxide to make hydrogen and carbon dioxide .
The researchers also added a special ' sorbent ' material to trap all the carbon dioxide produced , leaving them with pure hydrogen gas .
This trick eliminated the greenhouse gas emissions and also forced the reaction to keep running , increasing the amount of hydrogen made .
" The hydrogen starts to be made almost straight away , you do n't have to wait for all of the catalyst to be turned into pure nickel , " Dr Dupont said .
" So as well as the generation of heat , this is another way that makes the process very efficient . "
The researchers have shown that the two - stage process works well in a small , test reactor .
They now want to scale - up the trials and make larger volumes of hydrogen gas over longer periods of time .
" The beauty of this technology is that it can be operated at any scale .
It is just as suitable for use at a filling station as at a small power plant , " Dr Dupont said .
" If we could create more of our electricity locally using hydrogen - powered fuel cells , then we could cut the amount of energy lost during transmission down power lines . "
Details of the work will be published in the journal Bioresource Technology .

Although I have n't seen the terms confirmed at any of the traditional sources , it sounds like the Oilers have signed Alexandre Giroux , the 2008 - 09 AHL Most Valuable Player , to a one - way contract .
According to the same source Giroux claims to have had offers from the New York Islanders and a substantially larger financial offer from the KHL .
It seems obvious , then , that Giroux has been assured he 'll have a legitimate chance to make this club out of camp .
Giroux spent 2003 - 04 and 2005 - 06 in the Rangers organization , so there 's a good chance that Tom Renney is somewhat familiar with his game , although you 'd like to think he 's a better player today than he was four years ago .
The numbers would seem to bear that out .
Giroux has had incredible success for several seasons at the AHL level but , now twenty - eight , still has n't established himself as a full - time NHL player .
In his last two seasons with the Hershey Bears he scored 139 goals and 116 assists in 181 regular season and playoff games .
Size has never been a concern as Giroux stands 6 '3 '' and over 200 lbs .
I love having guys like this around because they serve as a warning to any young hot - shot with an entitlement complex .
You might be big and you might have talent , heck you might be the best God damn player in the whole fucking AHL ( I 've been watching Deadwood on DVD ) , and even then you might not make it .
Players like Taylor Hall , Magnus Paajarvi -Svensson and Jordan Eberle may want to make the Edmonton Oilers out of camp .
Alex Giroux is desperate .
If he gets beat out for a job , it wo n't be due to lack of try , and that 's for sure .
More on this signing and what it means for both the NHL and AHL roster after the jump .
The lesson of Jean - Francois Jacques is that there are some players who can put up gaudy totals in the AHL that are just plain awful when they move up a level .
Charles Linglet was the same way : close to a point per game in the AHL and just terrible in his five games with the Oilers .
He only played nine games with the Capitals last season and that 's not a lot to go on , but it should serve as something of a warning that he was badly outshot while he was on the ice , although the faceoff distribution ( 22 OZ and 32 DZ ) certainly did n't do him any favours .
I'm of course hopeful that the man is a player but by far the best part of this signing is that , even if we need to learn the lesson of Jean - Francois Jacques again , it 's now a lot more likely to happen , it may take Jacques ' roster spot to make it happen .
And that 's the take - away for fans of the Oklahoma City Barons .
Whether it 's Alexandre Giroux or Jean - Francois Jacques or Jordan Eberle or Magnus Paajarvi - Svensson , it 's one more quality player who is n't going to make the Oilers out of camp and who will start the year in OKC .
Here 's a list of all of the forwards the Oilers have under control ( signed or RFA 's ) for the upcoming season :
Sure NHLers - Horcoff , Hemsky , Penner , Gagner , Cogliano , Brule , Jones , Stortini , Fraser .
Possible NHLers - Hall , MacIntyre , Giroux , Eberle , Omark , Paajarvi - Svensson , Jacques , Reddox .
Sure AHLers ( or lower ) - O'Marra , Hartikainen , Vande Velde , Kytnar , Marquardt .
It seems likely to me that only half of the players on that " possible " list will start the year in the NHL if the Oilers do n't sign another forward - and they had better sign some other forwards - and everyone is healthy coming out of camp ( let us pray ) .
At the AHL level , all of those guys are good players ( save MacIntyre ) and some of them are difference - makers .
If the Oilers are serious about making the AHL club better , there 's still work to do , but this has been a good start .
Every move President Barack Obama makes is interpreted through the prism of process and derided as reactive and expedient .
Why Obama loses by winning
Thursday ’s passage of financial reform , just a couple months after the passage of a comprehensive health care overhaul , should decisively end the narrative that President Barack Obama represents a Jimmy Carter - style case of naive hope crushed by the inability to master Washington .
Yet the mystery remains : Having moved swiftly toward achieving the very policy objectives he promised voters as a candidate , Obama is still widely perceived as flirting with a failed presidency .
Advertisement
Eric Alterman , in a column that drew wide notice , wrote in The Nation that most liberals think the president is a “ big disappointment . ”
House Democrats are in near - insurrection after White House press secretary Robert Gibbs stated the obvious — that the party has a chance of losing the House under Obama ’s watch .
And independent voters have turned decisively against the man they helped elect 21 months ago — a trend unlikely to be reversed before November .
This is an odd reversal of expectations .
When Obama came into office , the assumption even among some Democrats was that he was a dazzling politician and communicator who might prove too unseasoned at governance to win substantive achievements .
The reality is the opposite .
You can argue over whether Obama ’s achievements are good or bad on the merits .
But , especially after Thursday ’s vote , you ca n’t argue that Obama is not getting things done .
To the contrary , he has , as promised , covered the uninsured , tightened regulations , started to wind down the war in Iraq and shifted focus and resources to Afghanistan , injected more competition into the education system and edged closer to a big energy bill .
The problem is that he and his West Wing turn out to be not especially good at politics or communications — in other words , largely ineffective at the very things on which their campaign reputation was built .
And the promises he made in two years of campaigning turn out to be much less appealing as actual policies .
“ I tell you , it ’s very frustrating that it ’s not breaking through , when you look at these things and their scale , ” said a top Obama adviser , who spoke on background to offer a candid take on the state of play .
“ Can you imagine if Bill Clinton had achieved even one of these ?
Part of it is because we are divided , even on the left .
...
And part of it is the culture of immediate gratification . ”
But there are many other reasons for Obama ’s woes .
Based on interviews with officials in the administration and on Capitol Hill , and with Democratic operatives around town , here are a half - dozen reasons why Obama is perceived as failing to win over the public , even though by most conventional measures he is clearly succeeding :
The flight of independents
Obama sees himself as a different kind of Democrat , one who transcends ideology but is basically a centrist .
By some measures , his self - image fits .
His war and antiterrorism policies are remarkably similar to those advocated by the man he blames for most of the country ’s problems : George W. Bush .
He ’s butting heads with teachers unions by enticing states to reward teachers on merit rather than according to tenure .
On immigration , he stresses border security over amnesty for illegal immigrants .
But on the issues voters care most about — the economy , jobs and spending — Obama has shown himself to be a Big Government liberal .
This reality is killing him with independent - minded voters — a trend that started one year ago and has gotten much worse of late .
On the eve of his inaugural address , nearly six in 10 independents approved of his job performance .
By late July 2009 — right around the time Obama was talking up health care and pressuring Democrats to vote on cap - and - trade legislation — independents started to take flight .
Many never returned .
In the past two weeks , Obama ’s approval among independents dropped below 40 percent for the first time in his presidency , according to the widely respected Gallup surveys .
A recent poll by Democrat Stan Greenberg ’s Democracy Corps found that 57 percent of likely voters regard Obama as “ too liberal . ”
“ The key thing here is [ that ] the economy and the unemployment rate hangs over everything , ” another top White House official told us .
“ Until that gets better , for most people , they will be frustrated . ”
The ideology conundrum
Even as Obama pays the price for liberal positions , he does n’t manage to reap what should be the rewards .
That ’s because he has never adequately reckoned with the divisions in his own party and taken a clear stand of his own .
During the campaign , he avoided the whole question of whether he is a centrist “ new Democrat ” or a “ traditional liberal ” by insisting the debate was irrelevant and uniting the party around Bush hatred and the power of his own biography .
But on a score of questions — how long to pursue war in Afghanistan , how much to emphasize deficit reduction versus economic stimulus , whether to court the business community or condemn it — the Democrats ’ internal debate is relevant .
Obama pays a price for failing to clarify and speak often about his larger philosophy , in the way that Bill Clinton often did , and instead responding tactically to circumstances on Capitol Hill or in the daily news cycle .
What is Obamaism ?
Conservatives think he stands for backdoor socialism .
Liberals think he is a sell - out .
Independents think he is a president with no clear compass who is breaking the bank with excessive spending .
Every move Obama makes , whether he is accommodating the center or the left , is interpreted through the prism of process and derided as reactive and expedient .
The tactical improvisation leaves even many Obama supporters saying they “ do n’t know what he really stands for ” — as though there could somehow be a mystery about where he stands after nearly $ 1 trillion in stimulus spending and two landmark pieces of legislation passed within 18 months .
The likability factor
Many Democrats on the Hill do n’t much like Obama — or , at least , his circle of advisers .
They think the White House makes them take tough votes but does n’t care that much about the problems those votes create for politicians facing tough races in November ’s midterm elections .
Numerous Democrats have complained privately that Obama cares only about Obama — a view reinforced by Gibbs ’s public admission that Democrats could lose the House .
It was no coincidence that Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) this week criticized Obama for not being tough enough in some legislative showdowns — and that Democrats leaked word that Nancy Pelosi ripped into a top White House official about Gibbs ’s comments .
In what would surprise media critics outside Washington , many reporters do n’t much like Obama or his gang , either .
They accurately perceive the contempt with which they are held by his White House , an attitude that undoubtedly flows from the top .
Insults and blustery nonresponses , F - bombs flying , are common in how West Wing aides speak to reporters .
In a transactional city such as Washington , personal relationships usually matter only at the margins .
But in a poor political climate , those margins can be important , and there ’s no mistaking that across the capital there are many people who seem to be enjoying the president ’s travails and cheering whenever he takes a cream pie to the face .
As individuals , most of the people who work in this West Wing are plainly decent and hardworking folks , who say the modern media echo chamber leaves them no choice but to be aggressive .
But Obama has recruited a team with an uncommonly brash collective personality .
His West Wing is unsteady
A lot of attention was paid to how Obama surrounded himself with powerful and skilled personalities in his Cabinet : Hillary Clinton at State and Robert Gates at the Pentagon sit atop that list .
But Democrats privately complain that the real power center — the West Wing staff — is n’t nearly as impressive .
A common gripe on the Hill and on the lobbying corridor is that the communications team is n’t great at communicating , the speechwriting team is n’t great at writing speeches ( exemplified by Obama ’s flaccid Oval Office speech last month on the BP spill and energy policy ) and the political team often botches the politics .
The criticism is probably unfair on several fronts .
It would be impossible for the best of communicators to offer clarity and convincing words when the country is locked in two wars , wrestling with a once - in - a - lifetime oil spill and mired in high unemployment .
But the White House did n’t help its cause by wrongly predicting a record - sized stimulus plan would hold unemployment below 8 percent and then waffling on its commitment to deficit reduction while signing into law massive expansions of the federal government .
As for the big speeches , Obama is often the main author .
The political team is rightly knocked for ham - handedness .
The White House failed to clear the Senate primary field in Arkansas , Colorado and Pennsylvania — even after dangling government jobs to help its preferred candidate in two of the races .
And it could n’t land the candidate it wanted to run for Obama ’s old seat .
But , then again , it is operating in a political environment in which the establishment has very little control in many of the biggest races .
Numbers matter
Obama is swimming up Niagara until joblessness improves .
But , even though Obama does n’t directly control the economy , he has not been a disciplined or effective communicator about the state of the economy and his prescriptions for it .
People will tolerate a weak economy if they feel there is an upward trajectory .
But Obama has not managed to instill that confidence .
“ The economy is off the charts on what people care about — nothing is a close second , ” one of the advisers said .
The unemployment rate is expected to remain near 9.5 percent through the election , which is a big reason that some White House officials are even more pessimistic than Gibbs about the chances of keeping control of the House .
It does n’t matter that Republicans such as New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg say Obama ’s policies helped avert a worse economic calamity than most Americans will ever realize — or that the federal government is turning a profit on some of the investments it made in bailing out companies in 2009 .
No politician can escape the gravitational pull of bad employment numbers and economic figures in real time .
The liberal echo chamber
Polls show most self - described liberals still strongly support Obama .
But an elite group of commentators on the left — many of whom are unhappy with him and are rewarded with more attention by being critical of a fellow Democrat — has a disproportionate influence on perceptions .
The liberal blogosphere grew in response to Bush .
But it is still a movement marked by immaturity and impetuousness — unaccustomed to its own side holding power and the responsibilities and choices that come with that .
So many liberals seem shocked and dismayed that Obama is governing as a self - protective politician first and a liberal second , even though that is what he campaigned as .
The liberal blogs cheer the fact that Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s scalp has been replaced with that of Gen.
David Petraeus , even though both men are equally hawkish on Afghanistan , but barely applauded the passage of health care reform .
They treat the firing of a blogger from The Washington Post as an event of historic significance , while largely averting their gaze from the fact that major losses for Democrats in the fall elections would virtually kill hopes for progressive legislation during the next couple of years .
In private conversations , White House officials are contemptuous of what they see as liberal lamentations unhinged from historical context or contemporary political realities .
The BP cam
Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) beat his chest to force BP to make public the footage of gushing oil caught by an underwater camera .
Democrats celebrated that as a victory for public accountability .
But it was actually a painful defeat for Obama .
The camera produced an indelible image played 24/7 on cable television that highlighted how ineffectual Obama has been for two months at stopping the catastrophe .
Obama is not responsible for the leak , and , realistically , there was little he could do to expedite the repair .
But for an irritable public , the Gulf Coast debacle was a reminder — horribly timed from Obama ’s perspective — that Big Business and Big Government are often a problem , not a solution .

Discovery receives main engines to power heralded orbiter 's final flight
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : June 16 , 2010
Kennedy Space Center workers installed three main engines into the shuttle Discovery this week for the orbiter 's final launch later this year .
Using custom lifts and tractors , shuttle technicians moved the powerplants from the engine workshop into Orbiter Processing Facility bay 3 , Discovery 's high - tech hangar .
The shuttle 's center engine , designated Engine 1 , was installed Monday .
Engine 3 was attached to the orbiter Tuesday morning , and Discovery received Engine 2 Tuesday afternoon .
All three of the reusable engines last flew on the shuttle Atlantis in November .
The hydrogen - burning units are manufactured and maintained by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne .
Engine 1 , which carries serial no .
2048 , will fly for the 11th time on Discovery 's upcoming flight .
The engine 's first launch was also aboard Discovery on the 1998 mission that returned John Glenn to space .
The most seasoned powerplant on Discovery is Engine 2 , or serial no .
2044 , occupying the lower - left position .
About to fly for the 13th time , Discovery 's Engine 2 first propelled the shuttle Endeavour into orbit on a flight to the Russian space station Mir in 1998 .
When Engine 3 lights up on the launch pad , it will begin its sixth flight since entering service on the STS - 116 space station assembly mission in 2006 .
Engine 3 is also known as serial no .
2058 .
Each shuttle main engine produces 400,000 pounds of sea level thrust .
When firing together , the three engines develop more than 37 million horsepower , equivalent to the output of 13 Hoover Dams .
NASA is preparing Discovery to launch on the STS - 133 mission as early as September , but the flight will likely be rescheduled for late October to give crews more time to ready the shuttle 's payload .
Discovery will launch the Leonardo cargo module , which is being modified for a permanent mission at the International Space Station .
Leonardo has already flown seven round - trip supply runs to the complex .
STS - 133 will also deliver another cargo pallet with spare parts for the space station .
These photos show Engine 3 being installed on Discovery .

Zombies and Water : What ’s the Connection ?
by Lakis Polycarpou | July 2 , 2010
Erik Assadourian of the Worldwatch Institute recently suggested that what with all the zombie books and movies coming out recently , Worldwatch ’s next book should focus on zombies and sustainability , because it would draw more attention to the institute ’s work than even the best written State of the World report could .
That got me thinking about the idea of zombies and water .
Is there a hidden connection ?
Some aspect of the living dead that gives us insight into the world water crisis ?
Just what do we know about zombies and water ?
I came up with a few thoughts .
According to the Federal Vampire and Zombie Agency , “ Almost every significant zombie outbreak in the United States came on the heels of a hurricane , flood or blizzard , ” which suggests to me a water link .
Given that , according to the agency , the zombie virus ( Mononegavirales , same family as Human Vampiric Virus ) is caused by ticks from tropical climes ( thus explaining the large number of outbreaks in those regions ) it does not seem farfetched that there might be a water - zombie link .
However , I can find no definitive causal connection in the literature between water and zombies per se .
Several sources cite zombie aversion to water as a primary defensive strategy when dealing with zombie attacks .
water remains a safe boundary against decomposing bone - biters . ”
Other sources , however , suggest avoiding shallow water in the event of a zombie attack , as zombies do enter water and can remain underwater indefinitely .
( Deep water is okay – zombies are too stupid to swim ) .
Much of the rest of the literature on zombies and water is focused on the human need to secure fresh water in the event of the Zombie Apocalypse — not an easy task when infrastructure has broken down .
It should go without saying that an important corollary to the Zombieland Rule # 1 ( Cardio ) should be “ Stay Hydrated . ”
It seems to me , however , that we should not let our justifiable concern with zombies blind us to the dangers of other monsters and the general monster / water connection , which can be broken down into three general categories : 1 ) monsters that come from / live in / come out of water , 2 ) monsters / aliens / witches that are afraid of / killed by water , and 3 ) the Gremlins .
The first category contains so many examples that , quite frankly , it would be tedious to list them all .
Flushed crockodiles , frankenfish , orca , jaws , anaconda , The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms , Leviathan , Moby Dick , etc. etc .
To sum up : do n’t go near the water .
Really .
More rare are those cases in which water actually kills the monster .
Most famously , there are the aliens from the movie Signs .
In this movie , a wise / psychic little girl keeps filling up glasses of water and leaving them around the house , so that when the aliens finally attack , someone can throw water on them and kill them .
Clearly this film is intended to highlight the importance of fresh water resources throughout the world , and illuminate the risk of alien attack once the world passes peak water .
Then there is the case of the Wicked Witch of the West , who melts horribly when Dorothy throws water on her .
Does this mean that she never drank water ?
If so , is that why her voice cracked so much ?
Does lack of adequate hydration make one ’s skin green ?
Is there a connection to anti-social personality disorder ?
These are all questions that call for more research .
Finally , there is one last case — the tale of that cute furry creature who multiplies when he gets wet .
( He only turns into a monster if you feed him after midnight .
Do n’t feed him after midnight ! )
It seems to me that the central metaphysical theme of this film is that Water is Life ! and that Life is Dangerous .
Also , that the fitness gurus who say not to eat in the evening are correct , but not for the reasons they think .
In conclusion , there ’s a lot to say about zombies and water but very little of it makes any sense .
Also , do n’t forget rule 1 ( a ) : Stay Hydrated .
Why Women Should n't Wear Pants
By David J. Stewart | December 2006 | Updated November 2016
“ In like manner also , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel ... ” — 1st Timothy 2:9
Women are to dress in “ modest apparel . ”
That is what the Bible commands .
It is not a matter of opinion .
God has revealed His will concerning the manner in which women ought to dress .
Rebellious women do n't care , they 're going to be lewd , rude and crude anyway ; but a woman that fears
God does care , and she is careful about the way she clothes herself .
The Greek word for “ modest ” in 1st Timothy 2:9 is “ Kosmios ” which means “ of good behavior . ”
Hence , the attire which a woman wears sends a message as to the type of moral character which she possess .
Women who wear pants either do not recognize , or do not care , about the spiritual dangers of lasciviousness .
The clothes that women wear send a message .
Proof of this is found in Proverb 7:10 ...
“ And , behold , there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot , and subtil of heart . ”
The Bible speaks about the attire of a harlot .
One cannot deny that sexually suggestive clothing is the attire of a harlot .
Any type of clothing that exposes a woman 's thighs , breast cleavage or is tight is immodest and sinful .
It does n't surprise me that the same society that has murdered over 50,000,000 of it's own children , in a Rock ' N ' Roll culture of celebrity idol worship , would also scoff and laugh at my preaching concerning Biblical morality .
It is a sin for women to wear tight pants , miniskirts and open blouses .
It is a sin for women to pose in women 's catalogs , because they KNOW that millions of men will also look through those catalogs and commit adultery .
It is a sin to become a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader , stripping down almost naked and showing the crowds their underwear while kicking their legs in the air .
Bally dancing is the most filthy trash on earth .
Plays and theatre performances are nothing but whore shows .
Get right with God America !!!
When the demon- possessed maniac of Gadarenes found Jesus Christ , he came into his right mind , put his clothes back on and sat down at the feet of Jesus .
Jesus is the cure for nudity !
The demon- possessed singer Katy Perry parades her lewdness , featured on the heathen cover of Rolling Stone magazine in her panties , hypocritically talking about what God means to her .
Evidently God does n't mean enough for Katy Perry to keep her clothes on .
Perry says her parents channeled God by speaking - in - tongues .
They raised a spoiled brat .
Perry went from Gospel singer to a lesbian - lusting loser .
Katy Perry is of the Devil .
In Perry 's latest 2010 album and song of the same title , TEENAGE DREAM , she invites the listener to put your hands down into her skin tight pants ...
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin - tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
It is heathendom !
Katy Perry is a CURSE to teenagers and young children .
Sesame Street promotes Katy Perry to small children .
Add to that a Godless public school system , now infiltrated by GLSEN , and you 've got an upcoming generation of militant lesbians and fornicators .
Katy Perry exposes the evils of women wearing pants , literally .
Repent America !
Any idiot knows that men are sexually aroused by SIGHT .
This is the great danger of women wearing pants .
Lest you think this a trifle matter , Jesus condemned the lusts of the heart as being equivalent to ADULTERY in Matthew 5:28 , “ But I say unto you , That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart . ”
Maybe you do n't care , but God does .
Immodestly dressed women cause men to lust .
Sadly , many women enjoy such sensual attraction , making them feel good about themselves ; but that is a very shallow and selfish attitude to have , and sinful I might add .
John 12:43 tells us to seek the praise of God , not men .
There are godly men who are trying to maintain clean minds , and you 're helping to hurt them spiritually .
God will hold every woman accountable for EVERY lust she intentionally caused in men by her immodest apparel .
In 1921 , Margaret C. Worthington , writing for the Moody Bible Institute Monthly , compared current immodest women 's apparel to “ grave clothes , ” worn by the dead in the tomb .
( SOURCE : Moody Bible Institute Monthly ; October 1921 : # 617 )
That was back in 1921 !
My how times have changed .
Immodest clothing destroys a woman 's natural modesty .
It also ruins men's morals .
The Playboy ( Homo ) Sexual Revolution has indoctrinated American men to view women as mere sex objects , a form of entertainment .
In other words , sex just for the sake of sex , which is the basis of homosexuality , incest and pedophilia .
Modesty is the greatest safeguard of a woman 's feminine virtue .
PANTS ON FEMALES : THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT ( by Dr. Bob Gray Sr. )
Loose - Dressin ' , Hoochie - Mama , Low - Cut , Tight - Pants , Breast - Showin ' , Butt - Popping Women !
The Sin of Women Dressing Immodestly 1st Timothy 2:9 , “ In like manner also , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefacedness and sobriety ; not with broided hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array . ”
The Bible plainly evidences in the account of king David committing adultery with Bath - sheba the dangers of women displaying their naked bodies in public .
David went out on his roof and saw Bathsheba bathing naked and the rest is history . . .
2nd Samuel 11:2 , “ And it came to pass in an eveningtide , that David arose from off his bed , and walked upon the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself ; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
And David sent and enquired after the woman .
And one said , Is not this Bath - sheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ?
And David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her . ”
Bath - sheba was either careless or deliberately seduced king David .
The man after God 's own heart chose to commit adultery because of a naked woman .
This plainly evidences WHY women ought to wear proper attire in public .
Godless women do n't care ; Christian women do care .
It is sinful for whores like Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to lie on the ground in sensual poses , rolling around in lingerie on TV , jumping around in their panties on YouTube , behaving like demon- possessed heathens , and leading the world 's young girls to follow their evil example .
No wonder the abortion rate is so high , adultery and fornication are epidemic in America , and moral looseness has become the norm .
Lesbianism is everywhere , a consequence of unrestrained lusts ( Romans 1:24 - 27 ) .
God 's curse is upon our nation .
Nothing has changed in 3,000 years since David and Bath - Sheba .
Sexual sins are commonplace in the world today , especially in America because of all the whorishly unclothed women .
Americans live in a sexually degenerate , perverted , and sensual society ...
a SEX - SICKO SOCIETY !
Such women are evil in their hearts , who value the lustful attention of men rather than the praise of God for being a virtuous woman .
There are no women any uglier spiritually than whores like Madonna , Anna Nicole Smith , Selena Gomez , Katy Perry ( Hudson ) , Sandra Bullock , and hundreds more who strip naked for the world to lust upon .
Here is an excellent quote from Pastor Bob Gray Sr. concerning women wearing pants ...
If you are an honest person you will have to admit that females in public have taken the half off sale seriously .
Hip hugging skinny jeans revealing mid riffs .
I travel every week of the world around this great nation of ours .
It is embarrassing for a man who is doing the best he can to keep his heart right with all of the female flesh on display .
Then I go into some of our churches and find myself wondering who is standing for the Bible principle of distinction in God 's house .
The decline of American morality is reflected in our distinction .
The decline of our churches is also reflected in our dress distinction .
50 years ago it was not so in public and for sure it was not so in our churches .
The Mrs. Cleaver look was in almost every home in 1950's .
Not so in either the home or the house of God , in a lot of cases , in this new Millennium .
If God wanted a distinction in the Old Testament how much more does He desire it in the New Testament .
. . .
Let 's face it the breaking down between the sexes has taken place .
We no longer have the distinctions we once had between men and women including the way they dress .
Dr. Hyles and others warned us of this danger ( Dr. Hyles , MP3 sermon , “ UNISEX ” ) more than they warned us of women wearing pants .
He warned us of the danger of losing the distinction between the sexes .
Pants was a symptom of the issue , but many have turned this against those who warned of the true danger .

M any Women Sinfully Sport in Causing Lasciviousness Proverbs 6:26 , “ For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread : and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life . ”
It is evil for any woman to deliberately cause lasciviousness by her immodest attire .
Some women are very cruel and want to hurt others .
This evil is commonplace today .
Sensual smut flows out of Hollywood and Walt Disney like sewage flowing into a cesspool .
It is a cesspool of iniquity !
In fact , many people today think it 's perfectly normal and acceptable for women to dress whorish to arouse men , with no consideration for the sexual sins caused by their evil influence .
Woman who purposely dress immodestly are guilty of idolatry .
She is placing her own will above God 's Word , making herself to be a god , and is causing men to worship her body instead of God .
It is evil .
Many secular songs have been written to attest to this fact , such as John Mayer 's “ Your Body Is A Wonderland . ”
This one song in particular has brought Mr. Mayer worldwide fame and fortune .
The song is nothing more than idolatrous worship of a woman 's body — SEX !
Selena Gomez and Katy Perry admit the demonic influences of Rock music upon the fans .
Katy Perry does n't even wear clothes on her latest album , TEENAGE DREAM .
The Word of God commands us , as believers , not to love the lusts of this world ( 1st John 2:15 - 17 ) .
John Mayer , Selena Gomez , Katy Perry ( Hudson ) , Madonna , Britney Spears , Cher , and all of Hollywood , Walt Disney , Las Vegas , and an untold multitude of whores and whoremongers across America , are serving the Devil .
There is nothing more evil than a woman like Britney Spears who deliberately entices men with immoral clothing , nudity or lewd behavior .
Here are the words that Proverb 7:18 tells us the whore says ...
Proverb 7:18 , “ Come , let us take our fill of love until the morning : let us solace ourselves with loves . ”
Now here are the lyrics from Britney Spears ' filthy song , SODA POP ... " . . . we might start riding to the music tonight .
. . a WICKED TIME to the end . . . we 'll flex tonight until they break down the door . . .
It 's cool Britney when we get down on the floor .
. . and we go on and on until the break of dawn "
No wonder our mentally - ill society has to give out condoms to all the public school kids !
So your teen 's in an abortion clinic from listening to this kind of sicko music , which has made Miss Spears filthy rich .
You just lost your job because of the recession , while Britney Spears spends $ 16,000 a month just on her clothes !
1
Yep , I 'd say Americans are mentally - ill .
Read what the Bible has to say about the whorish woman ...
Proverbs 7:25 - 27 , “ Let not thine heart decline to her ways , go not astray in her paths .
For she hath cast down many wounded : yea , many strong men have been slain by her .
Her house is the way to hell , going down to the chambers of death . ”
God never changes ( Malachi 3:6 ) .
The Old Testament magnifies the wrath of God ; but the New Testament the love of God .
God loves humanity and has made a way of escape through faith in His only begotten son , Jesus Christ .
But do n't mistake God 's longsuffering and patience , Christ - rejecters will burn in the Lake of Fire forever ( 2nd Thessalonians 1:8- 9 ; Revelation 20:11 - 15 ; 21:8 ) .
If you want a clear picture of God today , then you must take the Bible as a whole .
Most Women Don't Care , So What is a Christian Man to Do ?
But you ask , “ Preacher , is n't it normal for a man to want to lust upon a women ? ”
Yes , for the carnal man .
I 'd worry about any man who did n't have such desires .
Any man who does n't desire to look upon a beautiful woman is either sick or needs to move to San Fransicko .
Albeit , I 'm not talking about being normal in the carnal sense ; I 'm talking about living by faith to please God.
Jesus plainly taught that lust is adultery .
Matthew 5:28 , “ But I say unto you ,
That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart . ”
There is no room for debate .
Sexual lust is a sin , unless it 's your wife or husband .
It is normal to be a heathen , but God saved us so we would n't live like that anymore .
God wants
His children to be zealous of good works ( Titus 2:14 ) .
I 'm talking about walking in the Spirit of God. Galatians 5:25 , “ If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit . ”
Every saved person LIVES in the Sprit , i.e. , they have the Holy Spirit of God indwelling them ( Romans 8:9 ) .
But to walk in the Spirit is to yield in obedience to the teachings of God 's Word as a believer , as evidenced by Galatians 5:25 .
How does a person avoid sexually impure thoughts ?
The answer is found in multiple Scriptures ...
1st Peter 2:11 , “ Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul . ”
How does one abstain from fleshy lusts , since we cannot help but see filth in today 's sexually degenerative American society ?
Victoria 's Secret is no longer a secret !
The answer is found in the next point .
2nd Corinthians 10:5 , “ Casting down imaginations , and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ . ”
When a man sees a lewd or whorish looking woman ( i.e. , the attire of a harlot ) , then he is to cast down any thought of lust ...
“ No , I wo n't think that way .
I want a clean heart oh God . ”
He is to bring every thought into captivity the Bible says , to obedience to Jesus Christ , the Word of God .
Psalm 51:10 , “ Create in me a clean heart , O God ; and renew a right spirit within me . ”
Pray and ask God for His help .
Jesus told
His disciples in Luke 22:40 , “ ... Pray that ye enter not into temptation . ”
Carefully notice that Jesus did n't say to pray WHEN you are tempted ; but rather , to pray that ye ENTER NOT into temptation .
James 1:14 teaches that a man is only tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust .
Psalm 119:11 , “ Thy word have I hid in mine heart , that I might not sin against thee . ”
Memorize Scriptures as did king David to quote when tempted .
The Scriptures I am sharing with you are a good place to start .
When Satan tried to tempt Jesus , the Lord quoted Scriptures each time to defeat the Devil .
1st Corinthians 10:6 , “ Now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted . ”
The Jews wandering in the wilderness made a golden calf , an idol like American television today , that led them to commit sexual immorality .
Twenty - three thousand Jews were killed as a consequence , as an example the Bible says of what will happen to the wicked in eternity .
God hates sin .
Consider the warnings that the Bible gives to us today .
God is not a passive God concerning sin .
Hebrews 13:4 warns that God will judge all whores and whoremongers .
Proverb 23:31 - 33 , “ Look not thou upon the wine when it is red , when it giveth his colour in the cup , when it moveth itself aright .
At the last it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder .
Thine eyes shall behold strange women , and thine heart shall utter perverse things . ”
Do n't drink alcohol , which is liquid Devil .
Job 31:1 , “ I made a covenant with mine eyes ; why then should I think upon a maid ? ”
Job purposed in his heart that he would not have a dirty - mind .
Make a covenant with your eyes .
Anyone can choose to maintain a clean mind and heart .
The question is do you love God and want His hand of blessing upon your life ?
God 's face is against the disobedient .
You can live right in modern times .
Philippians 4:13 , “ I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me . ”
And a wonderful Scripture in Philippians 2:13 , “ For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure . ”
God wants to live the Christian life through us .
The Bible teaches that God puts the desire in our heart , both to will and to do God 's will .
Of course , men who are sin-loving pigs want women to wear pants and miniskirts .
It is sinful for women to wear pants or miniskirts .
Please do n't misunderstand me , I 'm not saying that it 's wrong for a woman to be attractive ; but Word of God clearly teaches that a godly woman should desire to attract men to her character rather than her body ...
“ Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparel ;
But let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
For after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves ” ( 1st Peter 3:3 - 5 ) .
Seldom do we see virtuous women anymore who look , talk , walk , and behave like feminine ladies .
Instead , they are feminists !
She - devils !
Long dresses are extremely rare in America today .
And if you do wear a long dress , people will immediately think you are a Christian .
Other women will persecute you .
2nd Timothy 3:12 teaches that those who live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution .
A women who stays home to care for her family is ridiculed these days by a rotten feminist culture of rebels , God-haters and abortionists .
The Bible warns about the many dangers of sexual sins ...
Proverb 5:3 , “ For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb , and her mouth is smoother than oil :
But her end is bitter as wormwood , sharp as a twoedged sword .
Her feet go down to death ; her steps take hold on hell .
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life , her ways are moveable , that thou canst not know them .
Hear me now therefore , O ye children , and depart not from the words of my mouth .
Remove thy way far from her , and come not nigh the door of her house :
Lest thou give thine honour unto others , and thy years unto the cruel :
Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth ; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger ;
And thou mourn at the last , when thy flesh and thy body are consumed . ”
Carefully notice Proverb 5:8 ...
“ Remove thy way far from her , and come not nigh the door of her house . ”
May all Christians today say with Joshua ... “... as for me and my house , we will serve the LORD ” ( Joshua 24:15 ) .
The Truth Concerning Women Wearing Pants
Here 's a great explanation of why women should n't wear pants from a godly woman ...
" Modest " means not extreme or bold , and not morally loose .
Those can apply to pants , yes ; but when I have on a pair of pants , I do n't feel that my body is covered .
Pants are form - fitting , thus exposing my body .
That 's just how I feel .
The illustration that Cathy Corle uses is two pictures of the same woman .
The first one has her in a nice dress .
She asked a group of ladies what they noticed about this woman , and they answered her face .
Then she showed them the picture of the same woman in a pair of jeans and asked what they noticed .
They said their eyes were immediately drawn to the crotch area !
That drove home to me that clothes can emphasize the body or the face ; I 'd rather have folks , especially men , notice my face and not my body .
Again , this is my feeling .
The other thing that convinced me was the doctrine of separation from the world .
The fashion of the world is to wear pants ( patterned after men's clothing ) .
This was n't the case until about 100 years ago , when actresses began wearing pant suits that resembled men 's suits .
Before that , women almost universally wore dresses ( I remember my Granny saying that she wore her brother 's overalls to pick cotton to keep her legs from getting all scratched up ) .
So the fashion of the world became women wearing pants .
I felt that , to be separate from the world , I needed to dress differently than the world .
I also needed to be feminine and distinctively female ; there should be a noticeable difference between my clothes and a man 's clothes .
The difference in our culture is that women wear dresses and men wear pants , so I believe it 's right for me to wear dresses .
Several years ago , my pastor gave some principles for Christian dress .
They 're very helpful , and they can be applied to male or female , pants or dresses .
1 . Modesty - does this clothing cover me adequately ?
I Tim . 2:9
2 . Not worldly - does this clothing reflect the current trends of Hollywood and TV ?
I John 2:15
3. Difference - does this clothing easily show there 's a difference between me and the opposite gender ?
Deut .
22:5
4. Inoffensive - does this clothing offend a brother or sister in Christ ?
As a woman , will this cause my brother to stumble or think lustfully about me ?
Rom 14:7-8,12-13 I Cor. 10:23 ; 8:13
5. Glorifies God - does this clothing glorify God , or does it call attention to me and glorify me ?
I Cor. 10:31
As for this being a matter between a wife , husband , and God : A saved man will encourage his wife to do what God is laying on her heart .
Several ladies have mentioned how their husbands did n't see the need for dresses only , but supported them in wearing them because the ladies felt that is what God wanted them to do .
With an unsaved husband , the dress issue can be a witness to her husband in one of two ways : if he does n't mind her wearing dresses only , it can be a witness of her changed life ; if he does n't want her to wear dresses only , her submission to him in this area will be a witness to him ( especially if she makes sure to wear what pleases him when they are at home , even if she wears dresses all the rest of the time ) .
This issue is just like any other that families have to make a decision about .
If your heart is open to do whatever God wants you to , and you study scriptures related to it and come to a different conclusion than others , you 've done what you need to to follow God 's leading .
We have freedom in Christ to follow Him as He leads us to .
I do n't know why some people develop certain convictions and others do n't .
How people dress is not a salvation issue ; it 's a separation issue .
It 's not my job to win them over to my way of thinking on separation - it's the Holy Spirit 's job to teach them how God wants them to live .
If they ask why I believe something , I 'll tell them ; otherwise , I stay quiet .

Thank God for such godly and feminine ladies who stand for the truth , and please the Lord Jesus by being virtuous .
“ Pornography ” is NOT a Legally Recognized Word This is very interesting .
The word “ pornography ” is NOT recognized in the U.S. courts because it is a relative term .
What may be considered “ pornography ” to me , may not be to you .
I experienced this exact situation with my boss at work .
I had complained about my co-workers bringing Playboy into the break area , so my boss told them to take them home .
In contempt and spite , my co-workers brought in MAXIM MAGAZINE instead to harass me .
When I complained to my boss about MAXIM , he argued with me that they were n't considered pornography .
Well , you can't even log onto MAXIM 's website unless you 're 21 years of age ... I rest my case .
MAXIM MAGAZINE is filthy , evil , vile , pornographic , and sinful .
After threatening an EEO complaint , the MAXIMs disappeared quick .
It would be a wonderful thing if every Christian man in America would demand that pornography be removed from his workplace .
Please read the following :
“ Pornography ” is a layperson 's term , with no particular legal significance .
Jones may believe that Penthouse is non-pornographic , while Smith believes that it is .
Neither is incorrect .
The term of legal significance is “ obscenity , ” which , after struggling for many years and through many cases , the U.S. Supreme Court defined in Miller v. California in 1973 .
It is a three - part test , as follows : “ The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be : ( a ) whether " the average person , applying contemporary community standards " would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , Kois v. Wisconsin , supra , at 230 , quoting Roth v. United States , supra , at 489 ; ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . "
Note that part ( a ) does employ community standards .
However , all three parts must be met for a work to be deemed obscene , and part ( c ) , as the Court has held elsewhere , is a national threshold , not a community test .
SOURCE
So the key is for Christian men to complain about “ OBSCENITY ” in the workplace .
“ Obscenity ” IS a legally recognized term .
Although debatable in court , one would surely be hard pressed to justify MAXIM MAGAZINE .
I shared this information with you to say this , pants on women is OBSCENE by every definition of the word .
Obscene : Designed to incite to indecency or lust .
Offensive to the mind .
Suggestive of or tending to moral looseness .
Tragically , most of the people in society today do n't consider pants on women as obscene , so it would n't hold up in court ; but they sure did 100 years ago .
Women were actually arrested for smoking in public 100 years ago .
Stores pulled down their shades on Sunday to prevent passers - by from window shopping instead of going to church .
Alcohol was illegal in the good old days .
The gangsters only thrived because of government corruption , not because of prohibition .
It 's the same corruption today .
Do you really think our government can't keep out illegal immigrants ?
Do you really think our government is innocently missing tens - of - trillions of dollars ?
Do you really think our government can't keep millions of tons of illegal drugs out of the country ?
We have been lied to by our government leaders for far too long , because most Americans are dumb enough to believe what they hear .
The frightening thing about the court 's definition of obscenity is that it hinges on the moral condition of society at that particular time .
This is situation ethics , not morality .
America had morals 100 years ago ; but no longer .
Today , Americans murder their own children by abortion , and encourage their kids to follow Harry Potter 's witchcraft .
Now legislatures are considering the federal legalization of “ gay marriages . ”
The next U.S. President after Barack Obama will !
Thousands of homosexuals have ALREADY been legally married in the U.S. !
Just wait until the divorces !
Can you imagine when a man has to pay alimony and child support to another man ?
If I were the judge , I 'd have to take several breaks to keep from laughing .
What has our nation come to ?
My how times have changed !
As American society becomes more apostate , homosexualized , promiscuous , and adulterous — the Biblical teaching of modesty is increasingly scorned with utter contempt .
Indeed , pants on women is obscene by Biblical standards , and is a form of obscenity which encourages men to lust .
Let the heathen rage if they do n't like the truth —
God is still on His throne !
Immodesty is Destroying America !
I love the picture to the right , which is from the early twentieth century in America .
We 've lost our moral compass in America .
UNISEX ( MP3 , Dr. Hyles ;
The unisex perversion sweeping America is a sign of the end times ) .
The bottom line is that pants on women cause people to lust with sinful adulterous thoughts ( Matthew 5:28 ) .
Do you think it 's a mere coincidence that homosexuality , child molesting , rape , and all sorts of other sexual sins have become prevalent in the United States within the past couple decades ?
It 's our sex - crazed American society .
That 's why condoms are being passed out to public school children .
That 's why President Obama put the founder of GLSEN in charge of the Safe School 's effort in public schools .
And now ObamaCare will bring Planned Parenthood into public school too .
What a hellhole our nation has turned into !
What a sad thing !
According to a study released in December of 2010 by the Parents Television Council ( PTC ) : “ Hollywood is shockingly obsessed with sexualizing teen girls , to the point where underage female characters are shown participating in an even higher percentage of sexual situations than their adult counterparts : 47 percent to 29 percent respectively . ”
In a Moody Bible Institute Monthly article , A. R. Funderburk , said that “ the present style of dress ” worn by young women “ tends to destroy the sense of modesty that God has implanted in the heart of every woman . ”
Without that sense of modesty , Funderburk feared , “ she is left defenseless , and it is an easy matter for the Devil in the form of a human friend to rob her of a priceless jewel . ”
( SOURCE : A. R. Funderburk , “ Serving the God of Fashion , ” Moody Bible Institute Monthly , 500 ) .
In other words , a young woman who lacks a sense of modesty is far more likely to have premarital sex and destroy her life and testimony .
If I had my way , I 'd burn every pornographic magazine .
I 'd burn every Sports Illustrated .
I 'd burn every women 's lingerie catalog that husbands are tempted to look through .
You can laugh if you want , but God is on my side .
The carnal , and unsaved man laughs at such high moral standards — as they also scoff at God 's Word , make light of salvation , and curse the name of the Lord .
It 's all a big joke to so many people today ; but they wo n't be chuckling when they stand in judgment before their Creator .
They 'll be urinating on themselves in fear .
They 'll be weeping in regret and shame .
I fear God , do you ?
Modesty Is The Greatest Safeguard Of Feminine Virtue !
If you are a born again Christian , then behave like one , for you and I will have to give account to God for everything in our life ( Romans 14:12 ; 2nd Corinthians 5:10 - 11 ) .
“ Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world .
If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever . ” — 1st John 2:15 - 17

Slippy is a HTML Presentation library written with jQuery , it takes a html file in and plays it in any browser .
It is optimal for programming - related talks since it includes a syntax highlighter and is very easy to use since it 's just standard html markup with a few classes to enable specific functions .
If you are making a talk about Javascript , it can even execute your code samples live and displays alert ( ) boxes nicely instead of using the ugly browser dialog , which - I tried it today - works quite well to prove your point interactively .
You can find the sources on github , view the example slide deck which includes some documentation or view the slides for the small talk I gave today about Javascript Events on my Slippy slide repository .
Obviously feedback is very much welcome and even though it 's not perfect yet , I hope it 'll be useful to others .
More docs and styling fixes ( the dark grey background was n't too visible on a projector , my bad ) should come soon as I have more talks planned , and the slide repository page will receive some love as well when I have time .

Countdown 's Worst Persons with two teabaggers as runners up , both playing concern troll for BP .
Rand Paul ran back to the loving arms of Fox News .
You know he 's never going to go on Rachel 's show again since the evil " libruls " are calling him names .
Rand Paul Is Back On TV Talking About Civil Rights And BP ( VIDEO ) :
He 's ba-a-ck .
After shunning the national media spotlight for a couple weeks , Kentucky Republican Senate nominee Rand Paul made his triumphant return to national TV yesterday .
And right away , he was back to talking about the 1964 Civil Rights
Act ( he says would have voted for it but claims he was " vilified " by the liberal press for having the " audacity " to bring up his issues with the law ) and BP ( " sometimes people are well - intentioned and bad things happen " ) .

And then there 's Dick Armey 's buddy from FreedomWorks Matt Kibbe who thinks that the largest industrial " accident " and I 'll use that word lightly , is a " natural disaster " .
Sorry pal but there was n't anything " natural " about it .
As Think Progress noted , given where fake grassroots astroturf FreedomWorks gets their money , this should not be a big surprise to anyone .
FreedomWorks CEO Goes To Bat For BP , Calls Oil Spill ‘ A Natural Disaster ’:
During an interview today with FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe on ABC ’s Top Line , host Karen Travers noted that the cover of his upcoming book — Give Us Liberty : A Tea Party Manifesto — says “ lower taxes plus less government equals more freedom . ”
Travers then asked , “ How does that less government sentiment square with this massive government effort down there in the Gulf to contain the spill ? ”
In response , Kibbe was able to kill two birds with one stone : deflect criticism from BP and his own personal philosophy by saying that he expects government to act “ when there is a natural disaster ” : KIBBE :
Well I think if you look at what ’s happened down there , it ’s a sad story of government incompetence as well as negligence on the part of BP .
And I think what you have to look at is when there is a natural disaster like this we do expect our government to do some things and to do them well .
And the whole point of limited government is you want the government to be competent at those few things that we need it to do and this is an example where the government was asleep at the switch and there ’s a series of regulations that led to deep drilling as opposed to more economical and safer options .
Rupert Murdoch took the honors for Keith 's Worst Person for this .
" Ground Zero Mosque " protest ends up , predictably , with racially - motivated hatred :
There was a protest yesterday , attended by various wingnuts , racists , riled - up nativists , and terrified fools , of the supposed " Ground Zero mosque . "
( It will not be at Ground Zero , and it will actually be a community center that will include a mosque .
But still . )
While national conservatives have picked up the ball , what local opposition there is to the proposed community center has been ginned up by Rupert Murdoch 's New York Post -- mainly via perpetually outraged columnist Andrea Peyser , whose anti-mosque columns are regularly teased on the front page .
The entire anti-mosque campaign is n't about anything other than pure , paranoid Islamophobia .
A Peyser column a few weeks ago was entirely about people in Sheepshead Bay -- some miles from Ground Zero -- protesting a proposed mosque solely because they 're scared of Muslims .
Anyway , they had their protest yesterday .
Mike Kelly of the Bergen ( New Jersey ) Record reported this heartwarming incident :
At one point , a portion of the crowd menacingly surrounded two Egyptian men who were speaking Arabic and were thought to be Muslims .
" Go home , " several shouted from the crowd .
" Get out , " others shouted .
In fact , the two men – Joseph Nassralla and Karam El Masry — were not Muslims at all .
They turned out to be Egyptian Coptic Christians who work for a California - based Christian satellite TV station called " The Way . "
Both said they had come to protest the mosque .
" I'm a Christian , " Nassralla shouted to the crowd , his eyes bulging and beads of sweat rolling down his face .
But it was no use .
The protesters had become so angry at what they thought were Muslims that New York City police officers had to rush in and pull Nassralla and El Masry to safety .
" I flew nine hours in an airplane to come here , " a frustrated Nassralla said afterward .
But do n't you dare call these people bigots !

Keith should have added wingnut Pam Geller to his list with Murdoch .
My ex fiancé , who was the first true love of my life really , used to roll his inside out European style joints on the cover , which is why it actually looks like that .
In my current relationship , this book has truly served purpose on the identically set up coffee table 15 years and running , when my favorite secret of all time suddenly had meaning —
“ I would give anything for an opportunity to show even the smallest kindness to my ex wife ” .
The book itself is a work of art by now , 15 years later on this coffee table , with so many secrets of its own .
1 . Why do middle - aged men risk so much for flings ?
With the caveat that every situation is different , one factor we think deserves more is the role of ( T ) in middle - aged men ’s eroticism .
In their twenties , men ’s T levels begin a long decline , often experienced as diminished passion and for life .
Suppressed T levels are associated with , heart attacks , , and overall mortality rates from 88 to 250 percent higher .
One of the few things that can reliably and immediately revive a man ’s sagging testosterone is exposure to a new woman .
One researcher found that even a brief chat with an attractive woman raised men ’s testosterone levels by fourteen percent within minutes .
In at Dawn , we suggest that many men may be confusing the changes triggered by an affair with actual “ love , ” thus leading them to make ill - advised decisions catastrophic to their families , their marriages , and eventually themselves .
2 . Does this explain why many men are afraid of commitment ?
A lot of men certainly know from experience that variety is an important element in their sexual response and that a lifetime of — even with the woman of their — is an intimidating prospect .
Whether this represents “ ” or self - knowledge is an open question .
This short essay sums it up pretty well .
3 . What does the human body tell us about our sexual evolution ?
The human body is full of information about our ancestors ’ sex lives .
In Sex at Dawn , we explain how women ’s breasts , orgasms and reproductive anatomy echo the same story told by men ’s testicles , penises , and seminal chemistry .
It ’s an X - rated tale of the orgiastic origins of our species .

​​​The state cannot take children away from a mother simply because she tests positive for marijuana use , the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled on Wednesday .
The Oregonian .
According to the decision , reversing a Marion County juvenile court ruling , the children ca n’t be taken away without evidence showing the mother ’s cannabis use endangers the kids , reports Helen Jung at
The juvenile court had earlier ruled that the state Department of Human Services had jurisdiction over the two children , a 19 - month - old and a 6 - month - old .
The state had argued that the simple fact fact that the mother used marijuana “ presented a reasonable likelihood of harm to her two children . ”
But the appeals court reasonably agreed with the mother ’s argument that the state had failed to provide any evidence connecting her marijuana use with risk to the children .
The children and the mother are identified only by their initials in the case to protect their anonymity .
​ The state of Oregon first became involved with the children in October 2009 when it received a report that a man was selling methamphetamine at the family ’s home .

Did you know that July 11th was “ World Population Day ” ?
Unfortunately , it is not a celebration of the world population .
Rather , it is a day that the United Nations uses to “ raise awareness of global population issues ” .
Yes , population control now has its very own holiday , and an increasing number of nations are jumping on board and are adopting strict population control measures at the urging of the UN .
In fact , many world leaders used the occasion of World Population Day 2010 to highlight just how well they are doing in reducing their populations .
To many Americans , this kind of thing is absolutely sickening .
Population control by the government is directly opposed to the American Dream and to everything that our founding fathers fought so hard to establish .
But today , even most U.S. politicians have bought into the radical population control agenda and are helping to export it across the face of the earth .
The truth is that now it is very hard to find a major world leader that does not agree with this radical population control agenda to at least some degree .
So what are some examples of these population control measures that are being implemented around the globe ?
Well , of course when most people think about population control these days , they think of China first .
China has the largest population on the globe , and they are famous for the strict “ one child ” policy that they have been running for decades now .
The communist Chinese are obsessed with population control and they have received awards from the United Nations for their “ hard work ” in this area .
In fact , rather than letting up , China has been continuing to “ push the envelope ” when it comes to population control .
In April , officials in China ’s Guangdong Province were accused by Amnesty International of carrying out coerced sterilizations in order to meet family planning goals .
Not only that , but it is an open secret that China has “ mobile abortion vans ” that are ready to spring into action when a woman who has already had a child is discovered to be pregnant .
But China is far from alone when it comes to implementing population control measures .
In Uzbekistan , things are becoming quite “ Orwellian ” .
Human rights groups claim that literally hundreds of Uzbek women have been surgically sterilized without their knowledge or consent in recent years .
So why are all of these women being sterilized ?
Well , it apparently comes from the top .
In fact , it is alleged that Uzbek President Islam Karimov has ramped up a sterilization campaign that he initiated back in the late 1990s .
In an official decree issued back in February , the Uzbek Health Ministry ordered all medical facilities to “ strengthen control over the medical examination of women of childbearing age . ”
It is also being reported that the decree instructed medical personnel that “ surgical contraception should be provided free of charge ” to all Uzbek women who volunteer for the procedure .
And quite a few Uzbek women are volunteering .
But many are not and yet find themselves sterilized anyway .
In fact , witnesses claim that Uzbek authorities “ are especially eager to sterilize women with HIV , tuberculosis or a drug addiction ” .
This population control agenda is being promoted aggressively in Africa as well .
At an event celebrating World Population Day 2010 , one Namibian official made the following statement ….
“ The delivery of reproductive services to communities has not only resulted in the reduction in the population growth , but has also led to improved general health and sexual reproductive health . ”
You see , in the twisted world of the United Nations , more “ reproductive services ” does not lead to increased reproduction .
It always leads to less reproduction .
These programs are particularly pushed in the third world , because the global elite see those populations as mostly “ useless eaters ” that are using up the earth ’s resources but not contributing that much to the global society .
In his recent article for PrisonPlanet.com , Jurriaan Maessen noted many other nations where top government officials are taking World Population Day and the global eugenics agenda very seriously ….
In the context of the UN ’s World Population Day ( last July 11 ) , several developing nations were quick to pledge allegiance to the eugenic deity .
In the east - Indian state of Bihar , officials put out the announcement that :
“ The Bihar government will soon formulate a new population control policy .
The policy will be framed in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund ( UNPF ) . ”
Another Indian state , Karnataka , had President Gladys Almeida “ observe World Population Day ” at which event she told local government employees :
“ There is a need to create an awareness on the need for population control . ”
Another individual present said :
“ as the population increases , nature takes its own method to control it . ”
President Zillur Rahman of Bangladesh pushed to step up an “ ongoing social movement ” to control the population :
“ Mentioning that every child should be born under a plan of the family , the President said , theme of this year population day - ‘ everyone counts ’ become appropriate in the context of Bangladesh . ”
Speaking “ while inaugarating the national programme on the World Population Day - 2010 ″ , Rahman concluded the event by distributing “ population awards among eleven grassroots level workers for their outstanding performance in population control . ”
Another compliant nation , Pakistan , had their Federal Minister for Population Welfare Firdous Aashiq Awan announce that :
“ The government is taking serious measures to control population growth in the country . ”
The government in Islmabad even recruits religious leaders ( a trick stolen from the UN ) in order to sell population control to the masses :
“ (… ) religious leaders are being empowered .
For the first time , ‘ Imam Masjid ’ is being made a partner in population Welfare programmes .
He would act as a social mobilizer , she ( Awan ) added . ”
There ’s more .
The United News of India put out a statement by Union Minister of Health and Family welfare “ on the occasion of World Population Day ” , saying among other things :
“ Strict implementation of laws about age or marriage and delayed first child with proper spacing may help in dealing with the population problem . ”
Do you see what is happening ?
It is not just a handful of nations that are implementing population control measures .
This is literally a global movement .
We are literally witnessing a tidal wave of support for population control sweep across the globe .
The truth is that the global elite are absolutely obsessed with eugenics and with population control .
For those who are new to this and would like more information about this radical agenda , I would recommend reading the following articles that I have published previously on various sites around the Internet … .
* Yes , They Really Do Want To Reduce The Population – 22 Shocking Population Control Quotes From The Global Elite That Will Make You Want To Lose Your Lunch

* The Population Control Agenda Behind The Global Warming Movement : For The Environmental Extremists At Copenhagen Population Reduction Is The “ Cheapest ” Way To Reduce Carbon Emissions
* To The Global Elite The Math Is Simple : Human Overpopulation Is Causing Climate Change So The Solution To Climate Change Is Population Control
The truth is that once you get the facts , there is no denying the reality of the radical population control agenda that the United Nations and the global elite is trying to force on the entire globe .
Population control is here .
It is much more “ heavy - handed ” in areas where the people cannot resist and defend themselves .
In countries such as the United States where these measures cannot be implemented by force ( yet ) , population control is presented as a “ right ” or as a “ choice ” .
But whether by force or by persuasion , the global elite are absolutely obsessed with getting the global population under control .
To them it is simple – they believe that climate change is the number one threat to the planet , and they believe that overpopulation is the number one cause of climate change .
Therefore , the global elite believe that population control has got to be number one on the agenda .
You see , they believe that by reducing our numbers , they are actually saving the planet and doing good for humanity .
Of course they will never volunteer to be first in line for any of these population control measures , because they have to be the ones to “ guide ” and “ oversee ” this agenda .
So what do you think about all of this ?
Do you think that I am making too much of this population control agenda ?
Do some of you actually support this population control agenda ?

It ’s out !
Game On !
The Bollywood - inspired music video we premiered at Comicon is now streaming on MSN and downloadable on Xbox !
MANY people need to be thanked , including @sandeepparikh for co-writing the lyrics , @jasoncmiller for writing and producing the song , @lisashearin for allowing me to use her book cover at the top of the video , @uhr our line producer for putting everything together , @gregaronowitz for getting us amazing sets ( including an ELEPHANT ! ) , Chantal Robeson for choreographing , Thom Williams for fight choreographing , Chris Darnell for DPing and @kimevey and @seanbecker for co-directing .
Whew !
So many other ppl to thank as well , but I should probably give some insight into the video now 🙂
I did not want to do this video .
There , I said it .
I was in the middle of MAJOR writer ’s block for Season 4 and the idea that we ’d ever make a music video after “ Avatar ” was just ridiculous to me .
I mean , half the comments about Avatar were “ How are you gonna top this ? ”
Which is probably the most creatively stifling thing you can say to someone .
( Ironically the FIRST TWEET TODAY I SAW WAS “ HOW ARE YOU GONNA TOP THIS NEXT YEAR ? ” HAHAHA ) .
Anyhoo , last year Sandeep actually said , “ let ’s do a Bollywood themed video . ”
And I was like , there ’s no way we can afford that .
Our budget is pretty low , and we were maxxed out on Avatar , which was shot on one stage , so I was like , it ’s never gonna happen .
Cut to April 2010 , and Microsoft and Sprint asked us if we have a music video this year , and then Kim emails me and wants to co-direct a Bollywood music video with Sean.
Errrrrrg . Eep ?
Kim already had the concept for the video down , the walls flying out , the dancing etc. and that seemed cool , but I was skeptical because I did n’t have the song in place yet , and everyone knows a music video without a good song is n’t gonna be great !
So I watched a TON of Bollywood videos on YouTube , and the craziness of the genre ( and watching some TERRIBLE fight scenes from Bollywood movies ) convinced me to at least TRY to come up with something .
I guess the key to overcoming creative blocks is to just release the need to “ top ” or “ equal ” or “ dazzle ” and just create .
All those pressure are extraneous and do n’t allow for anything good or great to happen .
It ’s my mantra now 🙂
Sandeep agreed to write the lyrics with me ( because I am not well - versed in Bollywood ) , we sat down and brainstormed , knowing we had to avoid Avatar comparisons at all turns .
I also wanted to avoid indicating that Zaboo and I were romantically attracted to each other , since that would confuse ppl , but since Bollywood is ALL about a girl and boy in love , we decided an outright parody would work and not be confusing .
Then we sent the lyrics to Jason Miller , who , with his production team , came up with a crazy slick tune and awesome electronic touches that make me laugh to this day !
I just want to say , Kim and Sean pulled a miracle out by getting all this done in time and on budget .
Gabe
Uhr , our line producer , pinched every single penny , and Greg Aranowitz did INSANE things on almost no budget .
That elephant has a MAN INSIDE IT !
And that temple was built on a friend , Travis Oates ’ BBQ area , lol .
Also , the costumes were spot on , Michelle scraped up great colors that stayed true to our Avatar - selves .
The day of the shoot was probably the most stressful day ever .
We had 3 cameramen , Chris Darnell pulled in every favor ever , and we had a JIB , which we ’d never had before , and allowed us to do those cool overhead -y shots .
We actually shot two days , one for the temple / fountain and one for the fight / gazebo .
The scale of it was enormous for web video , and the whole time I was excited but on edge , because with a crew that big anything can go wrong at any second .
Thankfully everything but a generator blowing up went awesome .
Thom Williams , our fight choreographer , brought in a trampoline and Sandeep actually did those flips !
I was so impressed !
My favorite parts are : Vork coming out of the fog ( Why does he take his jacket off and THEN PUT IT BACK ON ?!?! ) and Bladezz coming BACK THROUGH on the end vocal .
It makes me laugh SO HARD .
The most comments I ’ve gotten though are about Zaboo using my butt to type on , which I just pitched out during one of our MANY dance choreography sessions .
It was totally ridiculous and exactly in the spirit of what we were doing :
Not taking ourselves seriously and trying to have a good time .
The video will be for sale on iTunes IN HD next Tuesday , along with the mp3 everywhere for sale and streaming on iTunes .
I ’m extremely proud of it , and it turned out to be a collaboration that everyone helped make the best possible .
Thank you to my Guild team , the best co-workers in the world 🙂
China 's citizens have few options for investing their immense savings .
Chinese households are prodigious savers : China boasts a savings rate of 38 % , fully ten times that of the U.S.
But Chinese savers have few choices on where to invest their money : they can either leave it in a savings account which draws 2.25 % , less than the inflation rate of 3.1 % , or invest in real estate or domestic stocks .
The money pouring into property has created a worrisome asset bubble in housing , whichrose 12.4 percent year - on - year in May , according to China 's National Bureau of Statistics .
Chinese authorities ' attempts to cool the housing market have so far yielded little result .
With no other choice of where to put their savings other than domestic real estate and the volatile Chinese stock market ( the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is down more than 21 percent this year ) , then there is little wonder why both the Chinese stock market and housing market have both experienced massive bubbles .
Despite the general mood of optimism fueled by rising property prices in China , history suggests that all bubbles end badly .
The bubble in Chinese stocks certainly did ; the Shanghai Index has fallen over 55 % from its late - 2007 peak .
The restrictions which effectively funnel China 's vast savings into savings accounts that do n't even match inflation or into speculative asset bubbles in stocks and real estate boosts the risks of serious losses for Chinese savers and investors , many of whom have relied on the savings of three generations to buy investment homes .
The key problem is that owning a few flats , purchased with cash , is perceived as equivalent to a savings account .
But property is not like cash ; it is illiquid , and it deteriorates to zero value if it is not well - maintained .
This is especially true for highrises , which are the primary residential building type in China .
If the elevator stops working and is never repaired , what 's the market value of a flat on the 12th floor ?
Speaking of elevators , there is no need for an elevator to reach the 12th floor in this building : it fell over and is flat on the ground .
While the quality of construction has risen over the years in China , it suffers from various shortcuts and a cultural blind spot to the need for consistent maintenance .
I addressed this issue in China 's Towers and U.S. McMansions : When Things Fall Apart ( Literally ) ( April 14 , 2010 ) .
Poor construction quality keeps foreign property buyers away :
I think people in China , for obvious reasons , do n't often think long term .
People are more worried about things that may happen tomorrow or in the next two or three years , than they are about what may happen in 50 years .
But at some stage in the future , people will start to think more about the long term .
The quickly built but cheaply made buildings in Beijing will not literally fall down , but will deteriorate .
Wall paint will peel and elevators wo n't work .
Buildings will become uncomfortable because they will not have been properly maintained .
That 's when people will start to realize they 've paid a lot of money to buy a place in the Central Business District and they 've paid management charges , but nothing works and everything looks really poor .
But the developers will probably be long gone by then , so I 'm not sure what people will do .
Many buildings in Beijing are built with the cheapest materials available , which tend to degrade quickly .
This is a worryingly common phenomenon .
There are many buildings here that appear as if they are 10 or 15 years old , but are really just five years old .
That 's a little bit sad .
I have a 75 - year - old apartment in New York , but it 's still in great condition .
You do n't see that here .
Fast and cheaply built apartment complexes dominate the property market here and there will be future consequences for this .
And it might be apartment owners who end up paying them .
The apartment owners wo n't have any money to do so because they make $ 8,000 a year and paid $ 200,000 for their apartment .
Here is Jim Chanos in BusinessWeek :
Short - Seller Jim Chanos : Red Flag Over China :
They ( China 's leadership ) are on this treadmill to hell because 50 % to 60 % of GDP is construction .
And if they stop construction , you 'll see GDP growth go negative quickly .
That 's not going to happen because in China , people are rewarded at almost every level of government for making their economic growth numbers .
The easiest way to do this : put up another building .
So they 're really hooked on this sort of heroin of real estate development .
The perception seems to be that China will grow out of this situation .
But the problem with that argument is the real estate being built is not for the masses .
This is not affordable housing for the middle class .
This is high - end condos in major urban areas and high - end office buildings .
Just to give you an idea , right now construction costs in China are starting to hit $ 100 to $ 150 per square foot in some cities .
That does n't sound like a lot by Western standards , but it means a condominium basically presented to you with no floors , no walls , no appliances costs the average Chinese two - income couple $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 U.S.
That Chinese two - income couple in their 30s probably makes combined $ 7,000 or $ 8,000 a year .
You do the math .
Even if they were making $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 a year , they could n't carry a $ 150,000 condo .
This is very similar to someone making $ 40,000 in the U.S. at the height of our bubble buying a $ 600,000 or $ 800,000 house .
We know how that ended .
You get rough concrete walls for your $ 150,000 - - no finished walls , no plumbing except stub - outs , no wiring except the panel box , no interior walls , and concrete floors .
Even in China , where labor is still quite cheap , constructing your dwelling will cost a lot of money - - $ 50,000 is a good ballpark number but it would be easy to spend more .
So the apartment costs 25 times the household 's gross income .
For a U.S. household making $ 40,000 a year , that is the equivalent of buying a $ 1 million condo .
The after - market for new flats in China is near - zero .
Very few investors are interested in an " old " flat when there are thousands of brand - new ones available .
The net result of this strong preference for new buildings and the widespread practice of owning mutliple units for investment is that there is virtually no market for residential properties that are even a few years old .
Turnover in Chinese residential real estate is extremely low , on the order of 1 % or less annually .
That means all residential properties in China are fundamentally illiquid ; if you want to sell your three flats , there are few buyers .
Should several million owners wish to sell their flats in a short time frame , the supply would completely overwhelm the feeble demand .
Dumping hundreds of billions of yuan into illiquid , mostly luxury dwellings is a catastrophic misallocation of capital in a country with an average per capita income of $ 3,000 per year .
But that gross misallocation of capital is only part of the problem : since the vast overhang of luxury flats is illiquid and cannot be sold , these " investment properties as savings " are a black - hole capital trap : the invested capital cannot be turned back into cash .
Once the cash has been dumped into the black hole of illiquid real estate , it cannot escape ; as with physical black holes in space , there is an event horizon beyond which the capital cannot be recovered .
In China 's real estate market , that is the moment when the buyer 's funds are transferred to the developer .
This trapping of China 's vast private capital in illiquid , rapidly depreciating investment properties will have far - reaching negative consequences going forward .
When the time comes to transfer their " savings " back into cash , owners will find that their flats are worthless due to deterioration and / or the inability to find a buyer at any price .
All these luxury flats are speculative ; many are empty and will never be inhabited .
When the citizenry finally understand that the Central Government cannot stop prices from falling , or provide a deep , liquid market for re-sales , then panic will take hold , just as it does in the collapse of every bubble .
Unfortunately , investors in China will discover too late that luxury flats are not equivalent to cash in savings accounts , for the money only flows one way near a black hole : over the event horizon and into an inescapable capital trap .
Though many in China see foreign machinations at the root of every problem China faces , the real estate bubble / capital trap is entirely the result of domestic policies of the Central State .
As the citizenry realize their savings have vanished down the black hole , authorities will be unable to plausibly blame foreign " hegemony . "

Even Terry Branstad ’s admirers will tell you the man enjoys campaigning more than governing .
He loves touring the state , speaking to groups , working a room .
His wife says he ’s been “ giddy as a schoolgirl ” since becoming a candidate again .
Sitting governors attend many official events that indirectly serve their re-election ambitions .
It ’s one of the advantages of incumbency , and it ’s fair game .
Using the governor ’s office to raise campaign money and conduct campaign activities is a different story .
That ’s what Branstad and his top staffers did during the 1980s and 1990s , according to several hundred pages of documents Governor Chet Culver ’s campaign released this week .
I ’ve posted the Culver campaign memo with highlights from the Branstad files after the jump .
From the accompanying press release :
The documents illustrate how Branstad and members of his Administration participated in campaign fundraising , opposition research and candidate recruitment from the Governor ’s office .
Doug Gross , Branstad ’s Chief of Staff , was playing a key role in running the Republican Party of Iowa as well as Branstad ’s re-election campaign from his office at the Iowa State Capitol .
Another member of Branstad ’s staff , Jerry Mathiasen , was helping run a Congressional campaign from the Capitol and coordinating the Republican Party ’s legislative campaigns .
In addition , Branstad ’s State - Federal Relations Director , was spending his day working on selling fundraising dinner tables for the Republican Governors Association .
“ This is part of clear pattern of dishonesty and scandal , ” said [ Culver campaign manager Donn ] Stanley .
“ Already during this campaign , Branstad has admitted that , for the majority of his tenure as Governor , the books were never balanced but what ’s worse is that by keeping two sets of books , he hid the truth about the state budget from Iowans .
While today ’s information is new to Iowans , we already knew that , as Governor , he used the state plane for political purposes and held campaign fundraisers shortly after awarding donors multi-million dollar state contracts . ”
Whether this activity was illegal at the time or merely unethical is beside the point .
Taxpayer dollars fund the salaries of the governor ’s staff .
It is inappropriate to have the governor ’s staff doing campaign work for Branstad and other Republicans on the public ’s dime .
The Branstad campaign ’s response to this week ’s document dump was telling :
“ Chet Culver and his campaign can spend their time wallowing in the past , while Terry Branstad is looking to the future and committed to open , honest and transparent government , ” [ Branstad campaign manager Jeff ]
Boeyink said .
“ This attack is as sad and pathetic as Chet Culver ’s four years as governor . ”
So no denial , no apology , and no promise that Branstad ’s policy staff wo n’t do campaign work in the future .
We do n’t even get the “ learned from my mistakes ” line Branstad pulls out whenever someone challenges his dismal fiscal record .
Iowa State Professor Steffen Schmidt told the Des Moines Register , “ If I were Branstad I ’d probably sleep OK tonight . ”
Schmidt views this treasure trove of documents as a sign that Culver “ may not have too many really sharp angles to come at Branstad . ”
I would n’t be too sure about that .
Culver campaign staffers have been going through about 1,000 boxes of material from Branstad ’s four terms in office .
I doubt they would release all the best stuff before the Fourth of July .
We ’ve got a long way to go before November .
Final note : Culver ’s campaign raised the issue of Branstad ’s abuse of power in response to the Republican ’s latest tv ad , unveiled this week .
The viewer sees clips from Branstad ’s rallies and hears Branstad tell the crowd : “ We ’re all here for one reason : to give Iowans a government that is as honest , as hard - working , that is as good as the people of this state .
To those communities fighting to stay alive , to the workers hunting for good jobs , to those families hoping for a better education for their kids , change is coming !
For those Iowans who want honest , open and scandal - free government , change is coming !
We did it before , and we can do it again ! ”
If Branstad wants to campaign on “ honest , open and scandal - free government , ” he should be prepared to defend his own record .
UPDATE : The Culver campaign released this statement on July 2 :
DOES BRANSTAD BELIEVE HE IS TRULY ABOVE THE LAW ?
3 DAYS AND NO RESPONSE ON EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT
DES MOINES – Terry Branstad and his campaign must believe that he and his cronies are above the law because they have yet to admit that using the Governor ’s Office to further Branstad ’s own political ambitions instead of putting the people ’s work first is wrong .
“ Branstad has yet to admit any wrong - doing or even promise the people of Iowa that he would avoid abusing the Governor ’s Office if elected again .
Terry Branstad abused the power of the Governor ’s Office and it ’s time he admit culpability , ” Culver / Judge Communications Director Ali Glisson .
On Wednesday , the Culver / Judge Campaign produced 400 pages of documents showing that Branstad and his closest associates , including Doug Gross , abused the power of the Governor ’s Office .
Branstad raised money for his campaigns and for the Republican Party of Iowa , using official state stationery , making fundraising calls , and used various staff and state resources for these efforts instead of working for the people of Iowa .
“ What Branstad did is wrong and unethical .
He put himself above the law and used state resources to further his own political agenda over any efforts to help the people of Iowa . ”

In one of the most painfully truthful interviews ever given by a Christian music artist , one - time member of the NEWSBOYS John James spoke in depth to Mike Rimmer .
Newsboys c1990 , John James 2nd from left
It 's 1995 and in High Wycombe the Alliance " summer showcase " is in full flow bringing together a mixture of British and American acts .
For a journalist like myself , it 's an ideal opportunity to meet and interview a pile of bands and I 'm wandering around the backstage area in the afternoon before the gig while the bands are soundchecking .
PFR , Iona , 65dBA , The Worldwide Message Tribe , re : fresh and Hydro are all there waiting for their moment to set up and over in a corner are The Newsboys .
Their singer John James is sat on a chair joking with his band mates when I dare to interrupt them .
" Excuse me , are you John James , " I ask politely .
" Who wants to know ? " comes the growled response .
Frankly the interview is a disaster .
The press room is above the hall and every beat and synth driven groove of the Tribe 's soundcheck fills the room where we 're chatting ruining my recording .
John wo n't get serious and seems content to answer my questions with flip and jokey comments .
Frustrated , I close the interview and hang around for the gig .
The Newsboys really go for it .
As it turned out though , things were n't right with the Newsboys .
Within a year an announcement was made that John James was leaving the group to return to Australia to be involved in local church ministry .
It was James and Pete Furler who had formed The News , the band from which the Newsboys originated , in the mid ' 80s .
After some local success , James , Furler and manager Wes Campbell had emigrated to the USA and , after an uncertain start ( the ' Read All About It ' album for Refuge ) the Newsboys had gone on to CCM stardom .
For their frontman to quit seemed a major blow though as it turned out Furler switching from drums for the vocal mic brought the Newsboys even more success .
But what of John James ?
The silence down the years from the one - time CCM star James has been deafening .
And so it came to pass that in October 2006 I found myself at a barbecue in a Brisbane park .
It was just a few families and singles having fellowship and it was the embryonic beginnings of a new church in the city .
The pastor of His Church was going to be singer David Evans , known in the UK for his ministry at the Cross Rhythms festival .
David was sitting laughing while teasing another of the church 's leaders , John James .
As is the fashion when musicians get together , they were swapping war stories from days on the road .
Even recently when they 've been ministering together things have n't always gone smoothly in the churches where they have presented a mixture of music , preaching and honesty for the churched and unchurched to experience .
Always the journalist , I asked John for a few general comments about his time with the band .
He said , " I feel really blessed .
We started here in Australia .
Just a bunch of guys - dreams , hopes , aspirations .
Uneducated but passionate .
We started this band here and looking back , I remember the thrill and the excitement .
I think a lot of people wish that they could taste and experience life in a successful band and it's pretty amazing to be on stage in front of tens of thousands of people .
An arena filled with people .
The excitement !
The electricity !
Hearing people bellow out in one crescendo an anthem .
Singing every lyric of every one of your songs .
It 's like you 're this conductor standing on the edge of the stage just conducting this huge crowd and taking them on a journey throughout the night .
It was the most incredible experience . "
He continued , " With the Newsboys , we were fortunate enough to be a part of doing some huge concerts .
My last tour with the band was the Take Me To Your Leader Tour .
That was one of the most successful tours that year in America , Christian or secular .
It was a massive tour .
At that time we were signed with Virgin Records and distributing secular in the US and so often the Virgin guys would have their reps and different guys come out to our concerts and they were blown away .
I do n't know what they expected .
They knew it was a religious / Christian band .
We were obviously the only Christian band , so to speak , on their label . "
John got animated just thinking about it and chuckled as he said , " Mate , I do n't know what they expected ; to come out and see a bunch of guys in long flowing gowns wearing sandals and beads and chanting on a stage , dancing and singing ' Cum By Yah ' ?
But they 'd come out and see this massive production .
The most incredible show .
The spectacular .
The multi-media .
The antics .
And arenas filled with people .
I mean it was powerful for them !
It was really exciting for me to be a part of something so big .
To experience it . "
I had a flashback of their Take Me To Your Leader tour performances and what struck me was the way that John and the band created pop music events that were certainly entertaining , but did they lose sight of the ministry amongst all the hi-tech production elements ?
" I think we were always passionate about the ministry , " he replied , " but I think as we evolved and things changed maybe the focus began to shift to some degree in regards to our blatancy of how we articulated that on stage .
We were very passionate about the entertainment side .
We always were , whether we were in front of 10 people or 10,000 people or 100,000 people , we never ever took the stage and did n't give a 110 per cent .
We wanted people to go away feeling , if they paid 20 dollars for a ticket they got a hundred - dollar ticket show .
We always did our best to captivate people .
Take them on a journey .
Maybe the way we delivered the simplicity of the Gospel changed like you said as we became more ' successful ' .
Maybe in some areas we gained a lot ?
Maybe in some areas we lost something too ? "
From his time with the band , it is certainly true that he sang lead on some of the band 's most classic recordings .
John agreed , " Yeah , there was ' Shine ' and I think ' Take Me To Your Leader ' and ' Not Ashamed ' .
It 's like they 've become classic songs .
And sometimes to be honest , if it was n't for the sake of the people like yourselves that are interested in doing an interview with me or sometimes people coming up and still asking for an autograph or I 'm asked to speak somewhere and tell my story , it 's almost seems like such a world ago now .
I almost have to pinch myself and say , alright , yeah that 's right .
I WAS in a band !
Oh yeah that 's right , we DID do that !
But some of these songs , yeah you 're right , they 've been sort of placed in Christian music history now as being ' classic Newsboys songs ' .
I feel pretty fortunate that I was a part of it . "
So could he still sing " Shine " now if I played the karaoke version of it - would he know the words ?
" Nah ! " he laughed , " I had trouble remembering the words when I was IN the band let alone seven and a half years later ! "
Our chat was going well so I asked John about whether he'd be willing to record an in - depth interview about his time in the Newsboys and also to talk honestly about why he had left .
He was reluctant to go public with the details and I did n't think the interview would happen .
So my wife Pippa and I drove north towards what they call the Sunshine Coast .
It 's certainly well named because even in Australian springtime it was warmer than a British summer .
We stopped off at Australia Zoo , established by the late Steve Irwin , where I learnt how to avoid being eaten by a crocodile !
( Do n't go near the water ! ) .
As a tropical rainstorm thundered and rain struck the roof of the car with a sound akin to a drum kit being thrown down a flight of stairs , we headed up the wonderfully named Bruce Highway towards the resort of Mooloolaba as a beautiful double rainbow lit the sky .
The Newsboys got their start on the Sunshine Coast where they made a name for themselves on the local music scene .
John James still lives there and another phone call led to us meeting for a coffee .
The hotel where I stayed was across the road from a packed beach and I settled into a coffee shop to read , drink and wait for John to arrive on a sunny Friday morning .
We talked for about an hour where , off the record , I asked a lot of searching questions and John shared what he was willing to talk about in a recorded interview and what he'd prefer to keep private .
There are some things which he prefers to keep quiet about , believing that it would be unhelpful to speak about them in public .
I promised to respect his wishes so that what you are reading are simply the confessions of a man who made plenty of mistakes , has been to the brink and been rescued by a faithful God.
John James has chosen to tell his own story and to let others tell theirs , if they choose to .
Newsboys c1991 , James 3rd from left
Being in a hugely successful band clearly had its own pressures for John .
As he admitted to me , by the end of his time in the Newsboys John 's Christian life was shattered .
" It did n't happen overnight , " he explained .
" You 've gotta understand .
You 've got a bunch of young guys that one moment we 're tanning on the beach in Mooloolaba and some years later we 're in one of the biggest Christian bands around .
The success , the fame , the money , the screaming girls , the autographs .
It 's like , how do you deal with that ?
How do you process that ?
You 're in this schizophrenic lifestyle where you 're surrounded by thousands of fans that are wanting to touch the very sweat that falls from your brow .
They 're wanting your autograph .
They 're wanting to reach out and grab you .
And then I 'm meant to come home and make the transition from this surreal , schizophrenic , adrenaline - packed lifestyle to come home to be a dad and a father and a husband .
And I found that after a period of time I was n't able to make that transition back to normality of lifestyle .
There was n't anyone mentoring or helping me to deal with this , mentally or emotionally .
It 's like you 've got people that surround you and help you to become successful but no - one really mentored us in regards of how to keep our heads in check .
I do n't care who you are , you put ANYBODY in that sort of environment for long enough and unless you have countermeasures to help you process and deal with that , man it 's gonna mess you up big time !
And over a period of time it began to take it 's toll .
Only in little things .
It does n't happen overnight .
Maybe a value dropped here .
A standard lowered here .
But it began to eventually take its toll on my marriage - the pressure of it . "
He continued , " I remember when it started .
I 'd come home off the road sometimes and find my wife crying .
I tolerated it for a while .
I remember one day I came home and I was just so fed up .
She was weeping and I 'm like , ' Woman , be quiet !
What 's your problem ?
We 've gained the whole world !
Your only stress in life is : " How many pairs of shoes should I buy today ? "
We 've gained everything !'
But my wife could see something much bigger than the success , the fame , the money , the position , the career .
She saw our marriage starting to erode and fall apart .
My wife is the sort of person who when she stood at that altar and said , ' I do ' , ' Till death do us part ' , she believed that .
And now she 's seeing us starting to drift apart .
I was starting to become very isolated .
You 're surrounded by thousands of people but you 're really lonely and you become very insular and very isolated and it really started to take its toll .
Our marriage began to spiral downhill , dramatically .
Slowly at first but then as time went by it began to go faster and faster and faster . "
It was at this point that John began to take solace in alcohol .
" I think for myself , I worked HARD .
We concerted HARD .
We toured HARD .
But I also played hard .
And for me alcohol was an escape .
Obviously it was n't something that was public knowledge .
I justified it as it helped me to process and deal with the pressure .
Now whether that was a crutch or not , I think after a while it became the dependency , where I needed that constantly .
And eventually it really started to take a grip in my heart and my life to the point where the alcohol was a serious problem .
It 's amazing how you can be in front of so many people but we do such a great job of hiding what 's really going on .
We become masters of hiding the truth .
Why ?
Because we have an image to uphold .
We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars creating this allure , this perception of perfection .
And the last thing we want people to know is that we 're actually just real people who deal with real problems . "
He continued , " But we found ourselves thrust into this position because we 're ' pop stars ' .
You never see people who are plumbers or gardeners or accountants .
' Wow can we have your autograph ?!'
But we happen to be in an environment , as artists , as musicians , where we 're put on pedestals because of who we are .
It 's a crazy , crazy lifestyle .
But I did a fantastic job of hiding that and masking that .
It 's almost like you become very sneaky .
You do n't mean it to happen , it 's a gradual process , but eventually you have to come to the realisation that you have an addiction .
A real addiction .
And yeah it really took its toll on my life and my marriage .
I got to a place that at one stage where I was drinking a carton or two of alcohol a day .
That 's a lot !
I got to a stage where in the mornings for breakfast I 'd have two six - packs !
So by lunchtime I was just totally intoxicated .
And this went on every day . "
This obviously began to take its toll on life in the band .
Did he ever go on stage whilst drunk ?
" You know what ?
As terrible as it sounds and actually I 'm ashamed of that , I did , yes .
Nobody would have guessed .
You can be surrounded by so many people but you 're still very protected .
I think it got to the point where it was becoming such a problem and my marriage was really starting to fall apart so I confided in the band about how severe it was .
They were totally blown away .
Especially Peter .
I remember the night we were in the studio recording some vocals .
We 'd cut all the music for the ' Step Up To The Microphone ' album and I was about to record the vocals for ' Entertaining Angels ' .
I confided in Pete and started to open up , telling some of the stuff that was going on in my marriage .
And he was just blown away .
I do n't think he really understood how he could deal with that .
It was pretty devastating for the band because they did n't know how to deal with it either . "
this is just awesome beyond words ..... narwals + sad keanu + reddit = epic
also the shading etc is incredible , it all looks so realistic !
Poland hosts landmark European gay pride Published duration 17 July 2010
image caption Attendance was lower than expected
Several thousand people have attended a European - wide gay rights parade in the Polish capital Warsaw .
It was the first time the annual EuroPride march was being held in Central or Eastern Europe .
Several small counter - demonstrations were also held and some people hurled eggs and abuse at those in the parade .
A BBC correspondent says gay people in staunchly Roman Catholic Poland find it hard to be open about their sexuality .
Church leaders and politicians regularly speak out against homosexuality , Adam Easton reports from Warsaw .
EuroPride 's organisers say they want to fight discrimination against homosexuality and promote a debate about legalising same - sex relationships in Poland .
Vuvuzelas and drums
The colourful parade began to the sound of pounding drums and vuvuzelas , our correspondent says .
Floats covered in rainbow flags and balloons carried politicians from Poland and across Europe .
One person was dressed in a devil mask and horns - a cheeky reference , perhaps , to the controversy this year 's EuroPride has caused in Poland , our correspondent says .
" We feel like they are 20 years behind the Netherlands , " said Ad Bakker , a 39 - year - old from Holland who travelled to Warsaw to show solidarity with Polish friends .
" But the atmosphere is good and we hope that EuroPride will help , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
A Polish friend of his , Sebastian Blaszczyk , 36 , said the situation was improving every year but Poland still had far to go in accepting gay people .
While EuroPride 's organisers had hoped a minimum of 20,000 people from across Europe would join the event , police estimates put the figure at several thousand .
By comparison , more than a million people attended a gay pride march in Madrid three years ago , our correspondent adds .
Warsaw 's authorities were given a petition with more than 50,000 signatures from anti-gay groups demanding the cancellation of the event .
British solidarity
In a recent survey , almost two - thirds of respondents said homosexual couples should not be open about their sexuality .
It is extremely rare to see gay couples holding hands even in Warsaw , Poland 's most cosmopolitan city , our correspondent says .
Those who do face verbal or physical violence , such as Ryszard Giersz , 25 , from a small town near the German border .
He won a small amount of damages in court last year after neighbours repeatedly verbally abused him and threw tomatoes and stones at him .
The UK's ruling Conservative Party sent its most senior openly gay member to the event .
Nick Herbert told the BBC his presence at the parade illustrated Britain 's support for human rights .
" Equality , respect for human rights , is fundamental for the ethos of the European Union and I think it 's entirely appropriate and right that the British Government should be represented here by me and the ambassador in saying that we stand full square behind these values , " he said .

Well , if you can describe the machine to create the heavens and the earth , in
enough detail that one " ordinarily skilled in the art " can implement
it , then , yes , that probably is worthy of a patent ...

It seems to me that the only time " software " should be remotely
patentable is if
it implements a novel and non-obvious electronic circuit or machine that
* could * also be implemented without the use of software .
For example , a
software - defined radio is an implementation of a real device on a computer .
The
real device can exist entirely on it's own in a physical form .

It really should be simple .
If you can perform the " invention " without a machine , e.g. a pencil
and paper , then it is abstract and not patentable , even if the pencil and paper
version takes longer than on a computer .
Another example :
If an invention can be performed on a Turing machine , then it
is abstract .

An Explanation of Computation Theory for Lawyers

I hope they read Computational Theory for Lawyers , if they do come here .
Our entire Bilski coverage , in a perfect world .
Afterall , software is what it is .
And even the 5th Justice , did n't agree that software is patentable on it's face .
Re : Bilski , they only all agreed that this BM patent as not patentable , and a majority actually did n't say that software is patentable .
So - the USPTO should side with NO SOFTWARE PATENT angle on the Bilski ruling , and let the court then clear up any questions from there , meaning that the USPTO does not do damage by approving software patents , and if a case comes up that the plaintiff challenges the USPTO then let the court decide that too .

... you no longer had to produce a working model / prototype of your invention .
Admittedly in some areas ( e.g. drugs ) , this may be a little difficult , but its a
sound idea which would solve a lotta problems .

I have seen patent lawyers seduced by the notion that UPSTO and the Courts have a duty and a responsibility to redefine patent law for the Information Age .
This is often a preamble to a justification for patenting software and genes , etc .
This is false reasoning , because it presumes what Congress would do .
There is no reason whatsoever to assume that patent law would be broadened to include software and genes by Congress , should they decide to revisit patent law , and no one has the right to make such an assumption .
For all we know , and enlightened Congress might specifically exclude such items .

Oh dear .
PJ , a few days ago I spent altogether too much time commenting that
algorithms were n't all of software and complaining that failing to preserve the
distinction would bite eventually .
Now it has .
Briefly , until recently the word algorithm in computer science referred to code
which was finite ( if arbitrarily large ) and eventually returned a definite
result .
That 's because Turing machines operate on algorithms , so defined .
All is not lost .
Even if we consider algorithms to have the broader sense in
casual use , it 's still true that any item of software has a perfect map to some
abstract structure in mathematics .
So at the very least , tying it to a specific
machine would seem essential to avoid patenting an abstract idea .

How do you compensate someone who works for an extended period developing a
novel technique for solving an engineering problem ?
Such things can't be marketed without explaining it in so much detail that
others can force the original creator out of the market .
An electronic circuit can be described mathematically .
This is what circuit
simulators like Spice do .
So why is an analog implementation of the mathematics
patentable , but a software version not ?

I was nervous about the USPTO 's possible response , but it seems that there will
be real gains from Bilski .
****** Quote ******
Factors To Be Considered in an Abstract Idea Determination of a Method Claim
A . Whether the method involves or is executed by a particular machine or
apparatus .
If so , the claims are less likely to be drawn to an abstract idea ; if
not , they are more likely to be so drawn .
Where a machine or apparatus is
recited or inherent in a patent claim , the following factors are relevant :
(1) The particularity or generality of the elements of the machine or apparatus ;
i.e. , the degree to which the machine in the claim can be specifically
identified ( not any and all machines ) .
Incorporation of a particular machine or
apparatus into the claimed method steps weighs toward eligibility .
(2) Whether the machine or apparatus implements the steps of the method .
Integral use of a machine or apparatus to achieve performance of the method
weighs toward eligibility , as compared to where the machine or apparatus is
merely an object on which the method operates , which weighs against
eligibility .
****** EndQuote ******
It looks like software on general purpose machines are ( hopefully much ) more
likely to be rejected .
This is definitely a fair victory .
****** Quote ******
(2) The extent to which the claim is so abstract and sweeping as to cover both
known and unknown uses of the concept , and be performed through any existing or
future - devised machinery , or even without any apparatus .
(3) The extent to which the claim would effectively cover all possible solutions
to a particular problem ; i.e. , that the claim is a statement of the problem
versus a description of a particular solution to the problem .
****** EndQuote ******
This is an important rule ( assuming it is new or newly focused ) , and , if taken
seriously , would possibly lead to the rejection of perhaps all of the
notoriously broad and " duh " patents we have seen over the years ( were
the rules to be applied to those patents today ) .
In an effort to narrow down the meaning of " abstract " as per Bilski ,
the patent office appears to be moving to requiring much more specificity in the
patent claims .
This would certainly put patents closer to copyrights in terms of
narrowing their scope .
A narrowed scope means it is easier to actually find
reasonable ways to invent around a patent .
Also , the patent author will likely
have to take more time to write up the patent ( and understand the invention ) ,
opening the door to more prior art coming about .
Independent invention getting
hit by the patent system will be less of an issue .
In general , fewer patents
will be worth writing , and fewer open source developers and users will have
reasons to worry nearly as they may have in the past .
I would say that practical patent supporters in high positions at the USPTO , in
adhering to Bilski , want to take the opportunity to try and remove the black eye
patenting has gotten and not handcuff those that produce algorithms ( eg , in
software ) and require freedom , while still enabling the taxing of the superior
product implementations among those involved in the manufacturing industry where
patent costs as a business line item are tolerable .
PJ , it 's not just you that believes Bilski has come with a " silver
lining " as goes open source .

i 4i recently announced the USPTO upheld their 5,787,449 patent .
There are three independent claims , Claim 1 , Claim 14 and Claim 20 .
Claim 1 was not in play for the reexamination ( going to the Official Gazette for Patents following the link to week 30 ( July 27 , 2010 ) and select Browse Granted Patents and entering " 5787449 " in the search box we can find that the recent reexamination was confined to claims 14 - 20 ) .
We are primarily concerned with independent claims and do n't look at 15 - 19 .
The validity of claims 14 - 20 were upheld by the reexamination .
14 .
A method for producing a first map of metacodes and their addresses of use in association with mapped content and stored in distinct map storage means , the method comprising : providing the mapped content to mapped content storage means ; providing a menu of metacodes ; and compiling a map of the metacodes in the distinct storage means , by locating , detecting and addressing the metacodes ; and providing the document as the content of the document and the metacode map of the document .
20 .
A method for producing from a document made up of metacodes and content , a map of metacodes and their addresses of use in association with mapped content of the document and stored in distinct map storage means , the method comprising : ( a ) reading the content of the document until a metacode is found ; ( b ) copying the content and storing the copied content in a mapped content storage ; ( c ) noting in the map the found metacode and its position in the content ; ( d ) repeating the processing of ( a ) - ( c ) until the entire document has been processed ; and then ( e ) providing the document as the content of the document separately from the metacode map of the document .
From the Detailed Description of the Invention we see that it provides the ability to store metacode attributes in a table instead of inline allowing the faster traversal of a mark up language , presumably for faster display .
The table provides pointers into the raw markup language data , a means of faster access .
Setting aside the notion of indexes and tables of contents that happen to include pointers such as page numbers and by association section and subsection numbers demonstrating the lack of novelty other than cart before the horse questions , lets address how this is tested under the Machine - or - Transformation test .
We could also note that there is an issue differentiating a document from an abstract representation of a document and that by an large we equate semantically the data and the visual representation of the document that it represents .
In other words , we are dealing with abstractions of documents which fully convey the ideas presenting by displaying the document visually , either on a computer screen or in printed form .
However Webster 's dictionary provides a definition of document compatible with our usage ( See 3 . ) .
First of all does " A computer system for the manipulation of the architecture and content of a document having ... " address a particular machine ( Claim 1 . ) ?
" A computer system " appears to lack particularity .
We know that the offending Microsoft Office software runs on general purpose computers .
We know from the Federal Register publication of the proposed rules 101 Method Eligibility Quick Reference Sheet ( available as 101 Method Eligibility Quick Reference Sheet , PDF , 49 KB ) , that the ... " Machine is merely an object on which the method operates " under " Factors Weighing Against Eligibility " .
Contrary to the views of some of the more vocal patent practitioner 's blogs simple recitation of the equivalent of " on a computer " may not be enough , that it may not be a particular machine .
We find in the Notes " (2 ) For a detailed explanation of the terms machine , transformation , article , particular , extrasolution activity , and field - of - use , please refer to the Interim Patent Subject Matter Eligibility Examination Instructions of August 24 , 2009 " which introduces the Interim Examination Instructions for Evaluating Subject Matter Eligibility Under 35 U.S.C. § 101 ( PDF File 389 KB ) and provides guidelines for the Machine - or - Transformation test .
The August 24 , 2009 letter is the first page of the document .
As background ( Page 6 , document page 5 ) tells us :
In accordance with the M - or - T test , the claimed process must : ( 1 ) be tied to a particular machine or apparatus ( machine implemented ) ; or ( 2 ) particularly transform a particular article to a different state or thing .
A method claim that does not require machine implementation or does not cause a transformation will fail the test and should be rejected under § 101 .
However , the mere presence of a machine tie or transformation is not sufficient to pass the test .
When a machine tie or transformation has been identified , it must be further determined that the tie is to a particular machine or the particular transformation is of a particular article .
Under II .
Particular Practical Application , B. Processes ( Methods ) ( Page 5 , Page 4 of the document ) we find the referenced definitions , and on Page 7 , Page 6 of the document ) specifically : A particular machine or apparatus or transformation of a particular article means that the method involves a specific machine or article , not any and all machines or articles .
This ensures that the machine or transformation imposes real world limits on the claimed method by limiting the claim scope to a particular practical application .
For computer implemented processes , the machine is often disclosed as a general purpose computer .
In these cases , the general purpose computer may be sufficiently particular when programmed to perform the process steps .
Such programming creates a new machine because a general purpose computer , in effect , becomes a special purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software .
To qualify as a particular machine under the test , the claim must clearly convey that the computer is programmed to perform the steps of the method because such programming , in effect , creates a special purpose computer limited to the use of the particularly claimed combination of elements ( i.e. , the programmed instructions ) performing the particularly claimed combination of functions .
If the claim is so abstract and sweeping that performing the process as claimed would cover substantially all practical applications of a judicial exception , such as a mathematical algorithm , the claim would not satisfy the test as the machine would not be sufficiently particular .
The impact of this is that we have conflicting guidelines apparently both in effect which if resolved in the applicant 's favor grants patent eligibility .
It accepts that a general purpose machine can be particular , but that if the method wholly operates on the machine " weighs against eligibility " .
Another factor that comes into play is whether or not the entirety of the claim is expressed as a mathematical algorithm enclosing all practical applications , addressing a judicial exception .
For purposes of looking further lets assume the Machine leg of the Machine - or - Transformation test failed .
We could note that Claim 1 . was not part of the reexamination , presumably from having been found invalid or inapplicable during the course of the trial .
From the court record O : Cases - CIVIL OPENi4i v Microsoft 607cv113 patent607cv113 LED ... ( PDF , 291 KB ) we find that Claims 1 - 13 were held invalid by Microsoft 's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment of Invalidity of Claims 113 of the  449 Patent for Indefiniteness Under 35 U.S.C. § 112 2 ( Docket . No. 83 ) .
Indefiniteness is a fancy term meaning that a Person Having Ordinary Skill in the Art would be unable to implement the invention from the description .
Claim 1 implementation was found to be indefinite , in all likelihood because the equivalent of " on a computer " did not provide sufficient elaboration for implementation on a computer .
Claims 14 . and 20 . are Method claims and bring up the question of transformation .
From II .
B. above ( the preceding Page ) :
An article includes a physical object or substance .
The physical article or substance must be particular , meaning it can be specifically identified .
An article can also be electronic data that represents a physical object or substance .
For the test , the data should be more than an abstract value .
Data can be specifically identified by indicating what the data represents , the particular type or nature of the data , and / or how or from where the data was obtained .
 Transformation  of an article means that the article has changed to a different state or thing .
Changing to a different state or thing usually means more than simply using an article or changing the location of an article .
A new or different function or use can be evidence that an article has been transformed .
Manufactures and compositions of matter are the result of transforming raw materials into something new with a different function or use .
Purely mental processes in which thoughts or human based actions are changed  are not considered an eligible transformation .
For data , mathematical manipulation per se has not been deemed a transformation ; but , transformation of electronic data has been found when the nature of the data has been changed such that it has a different function or is suitable for a different use ( the efficient operation of a word processor for example ) .
The first hurdle we see is whether or not the document data is abstract .
We could note that the actual text conveyed to a visual or printed representation might not be considered sufficiently abstract ( See 3a ) , simply enumerated while the metacode might be - it provides pointers to places in the document data , in abstract .
Setting aside simple prejudice we examine transformation .
We see that the document would be transformed as in the claims by the inclusion of the abstract data , in that it does provide suitability for a different use .
As noted first the use of metacode to implement the equivalent of indexes and a table of contents speaks to novelty " on a computer " or as a method .
One could ask if such manual uses were available more than a year before the filing date of the patent ( June 2 , 1994 ) and they were .
Think HTML , 1991 , Mozilla , URLs and other references - printed documents not withstanding .
The patent appears to be a field - of - use limitation on prior art to efficient computer use of the document data .
Prior art notwithstanding this purely software patent appears to have been upheld based on the transformation of the document by inclusion of abstract data to suitability for a different use - faster access or " efficiency of operation " ( from the patent ) .
We can conclude that in all likelihood the transformation leg of the Machine - or - Transformation test is currently being used to support the validity of purely software patents .
Claims 14 through 20 do not involve a particular machine .
( Note that the actual reexamination was completed in May 2010 , and the certificate of reexamination noticed in the Patent Gazette 27 July 2010 ) .
The only hope from this particular patent infringement case would be that Microsoft 's Supreme Court appeal were successful based on a finding that data is not a particular article .

I feel like a broken record , because I keep saying this .
( And I keep getting
ignored . )
Algorithms are abstract .
Software that runs , to the extent it is free of
programming errors , is an implementation of an algorithm .
( Usually of multiple
combined algorithms , but an algorithm combined with an algorithm is still an
algorithm . )
( Repeating myself a bit from a post above : )
That 's the way the math department described it when I was in college 20 or 25
years ago .
It was also the way the CS department described it .
Patenting implementations of algorithms , whether in hardware or software , should
be no problem , with a small , but significant caveat .
I 'm pretty sure that the
original intent of the people who wrote the law agreed on that .
( Someone in this article is busy pointing out that patents went south from the
point a working model was no longer required . )
The verbal descriptions in most of the patents I 've read are verbal descriptions
of algorithms .
Not the algorithms themselves , but verbal descriptions thereof
( and generally not very accurate , which is something else that needs
consideration ) .
Algorithms can be described mathematically , too .
Sometimes we say that the
source code is a mathematical description of the algorithm , but this is not
accurate .
Source code is a ( partial ) mathematical description of an
implementation of the algorithm .
One problem is that we keep arguing that source code is equivalent to a
mathematical description of the algorithm .
It is not .
It is a mathematical description of an implementation of the
algorithm .
Other parts of the description of the implementation include the context of
implementation .
When you make that concrete , you specify the run-time , the
libraries used , the requirements of machines the software runs on .
Either way , the patents seem to be conflating descriptions of algorithms with
descriptions of implementations .
Almost every software patent I 've seen
describes an algorithm , not an implementation .
Without the source code , you really can't recreate any sort of a functioning
machine , algebraic or otherwise , from any software patent I 've ever read .
I think that 's the line that should be seen .
( Does n't need to be drawn , it 's
already there , if we are willing to see it . )
Implementations are necessarily concrete .
They require source code and other
specifications .
Algorithms are necessarily abstract .
That should be the line .
If you want to patent software , you should be required to patent your source
code .
That means you must file it , make it visible .
Perhaps not the entire
source code , but the source code that implements the claims .
And , yeah , that would mean that source code could be written to avoid the patent
claims .
Of course it means that .
Regular hardware patents have the same problem ,
usually .

(1) The particularity or generality of the elements of the machine or apparatus ; i.e. , the degree to which the machine in the claim can be specifically identified ( not any and all machines ) .
Incorporation of a particular machine or apparatus into the claimed method steps weighs toward eligibility .
(2) Whether the machine or apparatus implements the steps of the method .
Integral use of a machine or apparatus to achieve performance of the method weighs toward eligibility , as compared to where the machine or apparatus is merely an object on which the method operates , which weighs against eligibility .
(3) Whether its involvement is extrasolution activity or a field - of - use , i.e. , the extent to which ( or how ) the machine or apparatus imposes meaningful limits on the execution of the claimed method steps .
Use of a machine or apparatus that contributes only nominally or insignificantly to the execution of the claimed method ( e.g. , in a data gathering step or in a field - of - use limitation ) would weigh against eligibility .
I expect that each submitted software patent will claim to be on a particular machine .
I see considerable hurdles for the proposer to overcome .
Take the ' one - click ' type of proposal .
The machine is not the browser client machine because it plays no active part in the process .
The machine is up in the interweb .
So , which particular machine is it ?
The process could be implemented on any interweb machine in the world .
All the interweb machines and the interweb website software they run can all be made to implement the ' one - click ' proposals .
In other words the interweb machines ' contribute only nominally or insignificantly to the execution of the claimed method ' and they are ' merely objects on which the method operates ' .
That is demonstrated by the fact that it is irrelevant which machine is used because they can have different processors , different operating systems , different programming languages , different interweb software and it makes no difference : they can all act as objects that have been chosen to implement the process for reasons not related in any way to their ability to implement the process .
How about a file system on a memory device ?
It is not a process .
It is not a machine for doing something .
It is a data structure which the USPTO has already ruled as ineligible .
Do n't tell me that the data structure is especially clever because it overcomes a limitation of another data structure .
Phooey !
Lets have a look at a feature in a personal computer program .
What is it about the feature that makes it essential to use a particular PC to implement it ?
Could you use any PC you liked ?
Yes you could .
Running on a particular processor , operating system and as part of a program that you wrote is a choice that you made that is not crucial in any way to the implementation of the process .
That goes for writing it in a particular language or implementing it as a web page on a local web - server .
They are all ' merely objects on which the method operates ' .
Let 's suppose that we intend to patent a wonderful new algorithm to reduce the size of video files stored on computers .
Of course , we do n't propose to patent the algorithm : that would be completely ineligible !
No , ours is a complete process for the transformation of the data from one form to another and back , using an algorithm .
Of course , it must be admissible because it is a process and it is a machine .
Now , the machine is , unfortunately , 'a machine or apparatus that contributes only nominally or insignificantly to the execution of the claimed method ( e.g. , in a data gathering step or in a field - of - use limitation ) which would weigh against eligibility ' .
So , we apply as a process patent .
Diamond v. Diehr : Instead , they seek to patent protection for a process of curing synthetic rubber .
Their process admittedly employs a well - known mathematical equation , but they do not seek to preempt the use of that equation .
Rather , they seek only to foreclose from others the use of that equation in conjunction with all of the other steps in their claimed process .
The maths in Diamond v. Diehr was ' a well - known mathematical equation ' aka ' mathematical prior art ' .
The Supremes said ' I want to let this guy patent the use of this mathematical prior art for the purpose of vulcanising rubber ' .
So , the Supremes do n't reject patenting mathematical / software prior art in a patentable invention containing no inventive components .
Its the invention that has to be inventive , not the components .
Note that one of the protect - able components in this case is a well known mathematical algorithm which was considered prior art .
Maths , of itself , is not patentable subject matter , but the Supremes accepted it as a protect - able part of an invention .
So how does our algorithmic patent hold up in the light of Diehr ?
Unfortunately , you cannot transform rubber , or any other material , using our patented method .
It is a transformation of data .
Let 's see if it improves our chances if we claim that the process is the end to end process of capturing the video with a camera , saving it to a file with our algorithmic machine and then displaying the result on a video screen .
Now , the ' material ' we are transforming is the light forming the video event .
However , anything less than a perfect reproduction of the original video event is not a useful transformation in itself .
So , the only difference between our transformative machine and the immediate display of camera images on a screen is the transformation of the digital data representing the video and the essential reversal of the transformation for it to be useful .
So , any transformation of material that takes place has to be reversed as much as possible for the process machine to be useful .
The invention does not transform material to another useful form .
The output of the machine is the same material that went in .
Either that , or the invention is just a machine to transform data and that is an abstract process .
Patent denied .

( Note : the remainder of this post is an implausible hypothesis , mostly not actual fact .
Hopefully , it 'll help show patent lawyers what life as a programmer when software patents are allowed can be like .
The analogy is not quite perfect , but is more or less the right level of ludicrous to describe the current situation . )
When preparing their cases , lawyers often want to cite precedents and similar cases , in order to demonstrate that similar cases have had similar results to their desired result in the past .
Due to the number of court cases that have taken place over the years , searching for citations can be a difficult job , requiring both skill and a lot of time .
Originally , citations were unprotected ; if a lawyer cited a case , then anyone could just observe the fact of the citation , and use the citation themselves ; after all , court records are public ( and for good reason ) .
Thus , it rather annoyed lawyers and paralegals who had spent hours trawling through obscure cases looking for citations , to see all their hard work simply copied the next time a similar case came up ; there were even widespread fears that some of the larger law firms had found devastatingly useful citations and yet were keeping them hidden , forgoing their use in less important cases to be able to use them as a surprise should they ever reach the Supreme Court , although nobody actually had any evidence of this happening .
The situation was said to cause a worrying lack of citation research , leading to a hypothetical future in which there was nothing but a few low - quality citations that anyone dared use .
Thus , after much lobbying , a new law came in ; henceforth , citations could be patented : upon finding a useful citation for the first time , the law firm in question became the only firm who could use that citation in their own cases for 25 years ( the idea being , that that compensated them for the effort of finding the citation in the first place , and after that , the citation would be free for all to use , thus benefiting the law community at large who would have a new useful citation to use in their own cases ) .
There were several safeguards in the new system ; " obvious " citations like recently decided cases in the appeals courts were deemed too easy to find and not worthy of patent protection , and citations could only be patented by the first law firm to find them .
However , it quickly lead to all sorts of problems .
One issue was that , upon finding a citation , you had no easy way to tell whether someone else had already patented it or not .
In theory you could trawl through the lists of published citation patents , but not only was this just as difficult as finding the citations in the first place , but the citations in the patents were deliberately written in an obscure and difficult style , that was just about enough to check whether a particular citation violated them , but not to reproduce it , thus subverting the whole purpose of the patents in the first place .
( Random commenters at Groklaw observed that it would make a lot more sense if the actual text of the citation itself had to be included in the patent , not just a convoluted description of it . )
As it was hard to put together a convincing case without the use of citations , it became commonplace for lawyers to simply ignore the patents of other law firms ; it was virtually impossible not to .
Because all the major firms were doing it , none of them could hope to sue another for patent infringement without risking a huge countersuit , thus leaving the situation amongst major law firms much the same as it was pre-patent .
As a bonus , it made it almost impossible for new competitors , not to mention pro se litigants , to enter the market , as they did n't have a huge library of citation patents to defend themselves with .
Another issue is that adding to the huge lists of citation patents that you had to trawl through to stay within the bounds of the law , there were thousands of other patents being filed all the time , often of dubious quality ; some law firms would file patents on every minor trial court judgement in a particular geographic area , just in case it ended up being an important citation some day .
Even obviously citeable cases were being patented , on the basis that smaller law firms would n't be able to afford the lawsuits needed to overturn the resulting patents .
With more or less every court case ever patented , generally with vague descriptions that did n't even make it clear what the citation in question would be useful for , the catalog of patented citations was completely useless , even for people willing to wait 25 years for the citations to end patent coverage .
( Not to mention , that the law changes quickly , and after 25 years most of the decisions were completely irrelevant due to changes to the law in the intervening time . )
So what 's the situation now ?
An oligopoly of a few big law firms , a large pool of citation trolls ( who own a lot of citation patents , often bought from actual law firms , and who do n't bring cases themselves and so who can't be countersued over citation patent violation ) , and a few smaller firms who have to first write their cases , then look for some really obscure and less relevant citations to substitute in for the ones they want to use .
Nobody else has much of a chance at legally practicing law at all .
Outside the major law firms , pretty much everyone hates the way citation patents turned out ; useless as protection against big firms , a threat hanging over everyone else , and not even giving useful information to the public .
There 's a growing movement to repeal them at the moment , and even a Supreme Court case which casts doubt on whether citation patents are even legal in the first place ( although it 's unfortunately unclear and ambiguous ) .
Hopefully , we can get them repealed , with enough lobbying and explanations of the situation .

Over the years that we have talked about software patents , comments about
including software source code in software patents have stuck in my mind .
They
all revolve around folk saying that they include source code in their own
patents or that the design of the software invention can only be explicitly
given by using the source code .
Every time , my little internal Mr. Irascible runs around ringing alarm bells and
shouting ' preposterous ' , but I have not been able to elucidate what 's ... what 's
upsetting the little fellow .
I can withstand the stress no longer .
I must have a go at rationalising this .
If
you are not convinced , then take it up with Mr. Irascible .
The source code is intended as the explicit blueprint of the software invention
such that someone skilled in the art can make one just like it .
Now , when I am
walking up and down the very middle of the high street shouting obscenities
about software patents it is because I believe that they do not give the
explicit blueprint for the software invention , but manage to define just the
functionality .
This means that no one will ever be able to invent another
invention that avoids the patent because anything that recreates the
functionality is considered violating by the courts .
So , surely the source code is the perfect blueprint .
Anyone skilled in the art
can make a device just like the one defined by the software source code .
Mr.
Irascible is ringing the bells again so this is where I need to start
cogitating .
What would it take to do what the invention does using the same
design , but coming up with a completely different blueprint ?
Let 's start with
another processor , operating system and programming language .
Immediately , the
courts and the USPTO would see an entirely different blueprint even if the
original source code invention was exactly copied .
You programmers know what I
am getting at .
The source code is explicit , but it is not capable of protecting
the construction of the invention even though the invention can be built exactly
using the source code in the patent .
Let 's be more particular about the particular machine since that is on - topic .
Let 's use the original machine , operating system and programming language .
We
can protect the source code blueprint of the software invention with copyright ,
but supposing someone finds a cunning way around that ?
For instance , let 's use
the SCO Obfuscation and Ladderage Process ( Patent Spending ) and obfuscate ' til
the pips squeak .
The courts and the USPTO will find it impossible to see the
original invention in the obfuscated code blueprint .
The original inventor
might , but what is it that he can see in the other code that he can use ,
alternatively , as a patent blueprint in such a way that he protects the
invention from the ' another machine ' and ' Obfuscation Process ' side - stepping of
the original patent , but still permits another inventor to come up with a new
invention that does the same thing ?
I might have said this , before ( OK , I 've said it again and again ' till I 'm blue
in the face ) , but I do n't think there is a way .
You might suggest that it can be
achieved in some way with pseudo - code .
I think pseudo - code suffers from exactly
the same problems as source code .
If you start from the bottom up , you start with op codes that cannot be
patented .
Then you get to individual lines of programming language source code
that can not be patented .
For software blueprints to be possible , it must be
possible as you go up the conceptual layers of the software to get to a level of
abstraction that is the invention and not just an inconsequential collection of
lower level components .
If you start from the top down , you begin with a general description of what the
program , as a complete entity , does .
This is a functional description and is not
patentable .
As you work down the layers of abstraction , you go past the
functional descriptions of program modules .
Functionality must not be
patentable , as explained above .
It is my belief that the bottom up and top down analysis never gets to a layer
where it is possible to produce a blueprint for a software invention .
Functionality disaggregates directly to blocks of unpatentable code .
So , once again I throw down the challenge .
If you believe you have a software
invention that can be protected by patent , show me the blueprint for your
invention such that someone else 's invention is not foreclosed by your blueprint
and your own invention is protected no matter what the building materials used
by someone else may be .
We will never get beyond the ' software is patentable , no it 's not , yes it is '
position with the lawyers .
I believe that the ' show us the blueprint ' is too
high a hurdle to surmount and that prior art discussions need never take place .
Whilst discussing prior art , let me pose this question .
When you come up with
software prior art , is it always to do with software that had the same
functionality as the software patent in question ?
Why do you think functionality
should be patentable without revealing the invention blueprint ?
Just because I
can see the functionality at work on my Amiga , what makes you think that the
same invention does the same thing in a Windows PC .
Listen .
No bells .
I must be right !

Could some people draft and post possible responses to the USPTO ?
I 'd be happy to write them a letter , but it 's easier to write a more complete response once I see what others are saying .
Any such response must be consistent with Bilski , since the USPTO must obey the Supreme Court 's decision in Bilski .
But since Bilski left many issues open , there 's a lot of room for interpretation ; I 'd prefer that the USPTO interpretation caused less harm .

I think that an idea is abstract if it can be separated from the rest of the
invention or done on different hardware .
I also think that this is a
sufficient , but not necessary condition ( e.g. there may be other ways to
determine that an idea is abstract ) .
In that respect , I like the " particular machine " fork of the test .
The real problem was always the " transformation " fork , wherein people
could invent all sorts of irrelevant " transformations " like those
involved when a bit is written to the hard drive .

The bottom line : Patent law needs to be revised to be crystal clear as to what
is and is not patentable .
My suggestion :
Only physical , created objects or
compounds for which there is a working prototype or , in the case of compounds , a
novel , provable usage , and where there is no " prior art " .
" Prior
Art " for which there is no patent places the object or compound in the
public domain .
No software , no processes , no methods , no biology .

I find it strange to have a Supreme Court decision on some question , and then
the organization ( here PTO ) goes and asks for public input .
That is going from
one extreme to the other .
Why would public input have any impact on what courts
decide ?
I think that is called dysfunctional .

(2) Whether the machine or apparatus implements the steps of the method .
Integral use of a machine or apparatus to achieve performance of the method weighs toward eligibility , as compared to where the machine or apparatus is merely an object on which the method operates , which weighs against eligibility .
This should read something along the lines of " the likelihood of eligibility is directly related to the degree to which the machine is dedicated to the method .
A machine totally dedicated to the method is highly likely to be eligible , a machine which can easily be used for other purposes than the method is unlikely to be eligible .
That takes the general purpose computer out of play rather nicely :-)

I suppose that IEEE - USA and Dr. Lee Hollaar are cooking up some advice for USPTO .
I wonder what it will say .
Will it be as rabidly pro-software - patent as their amicus brief ?

I think there could be some interesting discussions around a specific cases .
To me the most important patents that has the chance of being invalidated in
light of Bilski are the patents around H.264 .
For example , if you look at the a Patent like Apple 's US 7292636 .
" computing a particular value that is based on ( i ) a first order difference
value between an order value for the third video picture and an order value for
the first video picture .... "
This is the first patent in the list of H.264
patents .
They are clearing just patenting an aspect of an equation using words .
The
words are so obfuscated that it 's nearly impossible to determine what exactly
the equations are without going back to the standard .
Still .... this just an
equation .
If you think about what a video encoders and decoders do they are simply a
mathematical transformation of a compressed video to uncompressed video .
From my of point of view these are clearly an abstract mathmatical ideas that
could be done by anything that can compute and is not tied to a particular
machine .
If I am correct there has just been an untold revolution .
This could blow open
video on the internet .
We should be able to integrate H264 video into Firefox
and Opera and end the video standards war .
I wish there was a lawyer was
willing to help fight that battle .
Would innovation in video compression stop if you could n't patent the results ?
Absolutely not ..... There is plenty of money to be made selling Hardware capable
of better video compression .
Innovation can enable smaller lighter video
players .
The demand for such video players and the profit that can be made from
them to fund such research will not go away .

I clear reading of the word " particular " leads away from uncertainty .
In particular ( pun intended ) the definition of particular most applicable here
is " surpassing what is common or usual or expected " .
By such readings and definition , if you _can_ execute the resultant code on a
" general purpose computer " consisting of parts available from usual
and expected sources ( e.g. all the parts came from Dell , Fry 's etc. ) then the
machine is not " surpassing what is common or usual or expected " .
The fact that you _may_ execute the " invention " on a particular
machine is not sufficient , as I can custom - build a machine to any task .
It must be that the " invention " _can_ _not_ execute on a general
purpose computer to meet the " particular machine " test .
To that end , it should thus be codified .
Further , any case of execution on a
general purpose computer should be held as a priori , not infringing regardless
of any patent .
This is a simple enough line to draw actually .
Absent the electro - mechanical
doo - dad that makes the machine " particular " , it aint '
" particular " and so is not subject to any teaching of the patent .

In answer to PJ 's challenge , one example might be a patent that was already mentioned in a previous comment .
Apple 's U.S. patent # 7292636 , one of the patents in the H.264 portfolio , describes in part a method for encoding and decoding video information with variable accuracy timing specifications .
The previous poster claimed this patent could be invalidated post - Bilski because it was just mathematical equations .
This is not quite true , because the patent also describes the use of mathematical operations on particular data structures in order to implement working video encoders and decoders .
The patentability of the subject matter is dependent not just on the choice of mathematical algorithms , but on the choice of data structures , and the ordering of their application , to form efficient video compressors / decompressors .
This is an example of a software patent that does not simply cover abstract algorithms .
Support for this can be found in related Supreme Court rulings .
The latest Bilski decision references the Diamond v. Diehr ruling in 1981 , which said in part :
Our earlier opinions lend support to our present conclusion that a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula , computer program , or digital computer .
In Gottschalk v. Benson , we noted : " It is said that the decision precludes a patent for any program servicing a computer .
We do not so hold . "
409 U.S. at 409 U. S. 71 .
Similarly , in Parker v. Flook , we stated that " a process is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm . "
437 U.S. at 437 U. S. 590 .
It is now commonplace that an application of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection .
See , e.g. , 333 U. S. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co. , 333 U. S. 127 ( 1948 ) ; Ebel Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co. , 261 U. S. 45 ( 1923 ) ; Cochrane v. Deener , 94 U. S. 780 ( 1877 ) O'Reilly v. Morse , 15 How. 62 ( 1854 ) ; and Le Roy v. Tatham , 14 How.
156 ( 1853 ) .
As Justice Stone explained four decades ago :
" While a scientific truth , or the mathematical expression of it , is not a patentable invention , a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be . "
Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corp. of America , 306 U. S. 86 , 306 U. S. 94 ( 1939 ) .11
The Apple patent describes how a particular data structure , sets of macrocells representing frames of a video , can be manipulated to produce other data structures containing sufficient information to represent intervening frames .
The patent does not cover the mathematical functions by themselves , but the combination of functions and particular data structures that form part of the H.264 standard .
In Bilski v. Kappos , the Supreme Court seems to reaffirm the ruling of Diehr .
Finally , in Diehr , the Court established a limitation on the principles articulated in Benson and Flook .
The application in Diehr claimed a previously unknown method for " molding raw , uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision products , " using a mathematical formula to complete some of its several steps by way of a computer .
450 U. S. , at 177 .
Diehr explained that while an abstract idea , law of nature , or mathematical formula could not be patented , " an application of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection . "
Id. , at 187 .
Diehr emphasized the need to consider the invention as a whole , rather than " dissect[ing ] the claims into old and new elements and then . . . ignor[ing ] the presence of the old elements in the analysis . "
Id. , at 188 .
It might actually be worthwhile to go over Apple 's patent using the suggested USPTO guidance for factors to be considered in an abstract idea determination .
A . Whether the method involves or is executed by a particular machine or apparatus .
If so , the claims are less likely to be drawn to an abstract idea ; if not , they are more likely to be so drawn .
The Apple patent does not appear to need the involvement of or be executed by a particular machine .
So this factor favors the claims being more likely drawn to an abstract idea .
B . Whether performance of the claimed method results in or otherwise involves a transformation of a particular article .
If such a transformation exists , the claims are less likely to be drawn to an abstract idea ; if not , they are more likely to be so drawn .
Where a transformation occurs , the following factors are relevant :
(1) The particularity or generality of the transformation .
A more particular transformation would weigh in favor of eligibility .
This factor seems to favor a finding of less abstract , since the article being transformed is video information existing in a particular form .
( 2 ) The degree to which the recited article is particular ; i.e. , can be specifically identified ( not any and all articles ) .
A transformation applied to a generically recited article would weigh against eligibility .
Similarly , this factor also favors a finding of less abstract since the patent operates on particular representations of video information .
( 3 ) The nature of the transformation in terms of the type or extent of change in state or thing , for instance by having a different function or use , which would weigh toward eligibility , compared to merely having a different location , which would weigh against eligibility .
This factor may also favor a finding of less abstract , since the particular functions selected can have a significant impact on the resulting extent of change in the outputs .
( 4 ) The nature of the article transformed , i.e. , whether it is an object or substance , weighing toward eligibility , compared to a concept such as a contractual obligation or mental judgment , which would weigh against eligibility .
This factor may also favor a finding of less abstract because the specified process works on instantiations of particular data structures .
( 5 ) Whether its involvement is extrasolution activity or a field - of - use , i.e. , the extent to which ( or how ) the transformation imposes meaningful limits on the execution of the claimed method steps .
A transformation that contributes only nominally or insignificantly to the execution of the claimed method ( e.g. , in a data gathering step or in a field - of - use limitation ) would weigh against eligibility .
This factor also seems to favor a finding of less abstract because there is a particular field of use for the claims , video compression .
C. Whether performance of the claimed method involves an application of a law of nature , even in the absence of a particular machine , apparatus , or transformation .
If such an application exists , the claims are less likely to be drawn to an abstract idea ; if not , they are more likely to be so drawn .
The patent does not seem to be an application of a law of nature , so these factors are not relevant .
D. Whether a general concept ( which could also be recognized in such terms as a principle , theory , plan or scheme ) is involved in executing the steps of the method .
The presence of such a general concept can be a clue that the claim is drawn to an abstract idea .
Where a general concept is present , the following factors are relevant :
(1) The extent to which use of the concept , as expressed in the method , would preempt its use in other fields ; i.e. , that the claim would effectively grant a monopoly over the concept .
The patent does not appear to preempt the use of concepts in other fields .
Mathematical operations employed in the patent are not claimed in a way which would stop them from being used elsewhere .
( 2 ) The extent to which the claim is so abstract and sweeping as to cover both known and unknown uses of the concept , and be performed through any existing or future - devised machinery , or even without any apparatus .
Again , the claims appear to be particular to the field of video compression / decompression , and are not so abstract or sweeping to preclude other uses of the concepts .
( 3 ) The extent to which the claim would effectively cover all possible solutions to a particular problem ; i.e. , that the claim is a statement of the problem versus a description of a particular solution to the problem .
This is easy .
There are many possible approaches to the problem of video compression / decompression , and the claims of the patent only cover one of those approaches .
( 4 ) Whether the concept is disembodied or whether it is instantiated ; i.e. , implemented , in some tangible way .
Note , however , that limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postsolution components does not make the concept patentable .
A concept that is well - instantiated weighs in favor of eligibility .
The concepts of the patent are demonstrably instantiated in different hardware and software - based implementations .
( 5 ) The mechanism (s ) by which the steps are implemented ; e.g. , whether the performance of the process is observable and verifiable rather than subjective or imperceptible .
Steps that are observable and verifiable weigh in favor of eligibility .
The claims of the patent produce results that are easily observable and verifiable .
The success of video compression / decompression can be readily measure by a number of metrics including speed of execution , quality of resulting outputs , degree of compression for various video sources , etc .
Under the USPTO guidelines , it seems that examination of the patent as a whole could readily meet sufficient factors for a finding of not being too abstract to be valid .
In one way , patents in this area could be seen as an example where at least some of the goals of the patent system are being met .
Video compression is one area where there is no one best way or correct approach to solving the problem .
Advancements in the field are continually being made .
The presence of heavily patented approaches has in part motivated the development of alternative approaches for people where patents are a serious concern , while also allowing development of widely accepted commercial standards for people who value interoperability and consistency more .
The patent system does not serve people well when too many minor , incremental patents are issued that create roadblocks to further advancements .
This seems to be more a problem with the low thresholds that have been placed in terms of inventions being novel and non-obvious , rather than on the interpretation of whether claims are for abstract ideas .

SHENZHEN , China —
Inside one of the world ’s largest electronics factories , Yuan Yandong , 24 , sits on a stool six nights a week , 12 hours a night barring meal and bathroom breaks , and assembles computer hard drives for an American company called EMC .
Until a few months ago , he lived in northern China , where he grew up on a farm and worked at a local hotel after finishing middle school .
But this year , he traveled 36 hours by train to Guangdong Province in the southeast to find work in Shenzhen .
All he took for his journey south on the hard train seat was a sack of clothes , toothpaste , shampoo and his mobile phone .
“ Friends in my hometown said wages at Foxconn were good , ” he said .
“ So I figured I could earn more here . ”
A series of puzzling suicides at Foxconn and labor strikes at Honda auto parts factories in southern China have put the spotlight on what work is like inside the country ’s booming factories .
Analysts say rising wage pressure and demands for better conditions are threatening China ’s competitive advantage and raising questions about whether its manufacturing model can continue to churn out much of the world ’s toys , textiles and electronics at rock - bottom prices .
To do so , China will need legions of young migrants like Mr. Yuan to continue to make the journey from villages in the interior to the manufacturing hubs along the coast .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
" This is the first we know in the history of medicine that clinicians are actively trying to prevent homosexuality , " says Alice Dreger , professor of clinical medical humanities and bioethics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine .
Dreger and collaborator Ellen Feder , associate professor and acting chair of philosophy and religion at American University , have brought to national attention the first systematic approach to prenatally preventing homosexuality and bisexuality .
The " treatment " is targeted at one particular population of girls , but the researchers involved in the work say their findings may have implications beyond this population .
The girls and women in question have congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) , a serious endocrine disruption that sometimes results in ambiguous genitalia .
Their endocrine problem will require medical management from birth onward .
Research has shown that females born with CAH have increased rates of tomboyism and lesbianism .
The prenatal treatment at issue , however , does not treat or prevent the CAH .
Most clinicians who use prenatal dexamethasone for CAH seek to prevent the development of ambiguous genitalia .
But the New York - based group of clinical researchers whose work is traced by Dreger and Feder suggest that prenatal dexamethasone can also be used in this population to prevent the " abnormality " of homosexuality , as well as the " abnormal " interest these girls tend to have in traditionally masculine careers and hobbies .
Dreger and Feder 's paper on the topic appears in the Bioethics Forum of the Hastings Center and can be read at www.thehastingscenter.org/Bioe … x?id=4754&blogid=140 .
A new consensus from seven major medical organizations ( including the American Academy of Pediatrics ) will be published in August indicating that this use of prenatal dexamethasone is experimental and not to be treated as standard of care .
This comes in the wake of Dreger and Feder leading an investigation showing that the chief proponent of this off - label use , pediatric endocrinologist Maria New , treated hundreds of women with this experimental drug without proper research ethics oversight .
Time magazine related that aspect of the story : www.time.com/time/health/artic … 8599,1996453,00.html .
The FDA and the Office of Human Research Protections are now investigating these formal complaints .

Kai Hähner in der E - Mail : " Ich leide nicht an Homophobie .
Allerdings finde ich es unerträglich , wie Sie Ihre Lebensweise in die Öffentlichkeit tragen " ( Bild : CDU Chemnitz )
Der sächsische CDU - Politiker Kai Hähner hat in einer E - Mail dem CSD Leipzig vorgeworfen , Werbung für Homosexualität zu machen und damit Kinder vom rechten Weg abzubringen - er droht mit einer Klage .
Hähner , der einen CDU - Ortsverband in Chemnitz leitet und Bezirksvorsitzender der parteieigenen " Ost - und Mitteldeutschen Vereinigung " für Vertriebene und Aussiedler ist , kritisierte die CSD - Organisatoren für ihre Öffentlichkeitsarbeit : " Leben Sie , wie Sie wollen , im Privaten und lassen Sie andere mit Ihrer Abnormalität in Ruhe " , schrieb der sächsische Christdemokrat .
Grund der Aufregung ist ein Interview eines Organisatoren im Radiosender MDR Info : " Durch Ihre öffentlichen Auftritte und das Zuschaustellen Ihrer Lebensweise gilt Homosexualität inzwischen als ' trendy ' .
Und somit verleiten Sie Jugendliche , die sich in einer sexuellen Findungsphase befinden . "
Dabei kritisierte Hähner , dass Homo - Aktivisten auch in Schulen für Toleranz werben wollten .
Gerade die Forderung nach einer Sensibilisierung von jüngeren Kindern - etwa wenn in Kinderbüchern ein Junge von zwei Müttern aufgezogen wird - sieht er als " unerträgliche Unverschämtheit " an .
Hähner droht den CSD - Organisatoren sogar mit Zuchthaus : " Sollte dies in diesem Land tatsächlich passieren und Kinder schon im Vorschulalter mit Homosexualität konfrontiert werden , werde ich der erste sein , der die Verantwortlichen vor Gericht bringt . "
LSU im " offenen Dialog "
Für die Lesben und Schwulen in der Union sind solche Kommentare - besonders abseits der großen Metropolen - " leider " keine Seltenheit .
Bei allen Parteien - außer bei den Grünen - gebe es noch unterschwellige Vorbehalte gegen Homosexuelle , erklärte Matthias Steuckardt , Chef der LSU Ost : " Wir , die lesbisch - schwule Szene , müssen uns immer vor Augen führen , dass er ausspricht , was viele Leute - nicht nur CDU - Mitglieder - denken " , so Steuckardt .
Dennoch sei er froh , dass " immer mehr Funktionsträger der Unionsparteien anders ticken und unsere Ziel unterstützen . "
Er selbst habe Hähner kontaktiert und versucht , ihm in einem " offenen Dialog " seine Sicht der Dinge darzulegen .
Gegenüber queer .de wollte sich Hähner jedoch nicht äußern .
Er hat bis Donnerstagnachmittag nicht auf Anfragen reagiert .
In den letzten Monaten hat die angedeutete Gleichstellung von Schwulen und Kinderschändern wieder Hochkonjunktur :
Die katholische Kirche hat mehrmals Schwule beschuldigt , für den internen Missbrauchsskandal verantwortlich zu sein .
So erklärte etwa Kardinal Tarcisio Bertone , nach Papst Benedikt XVI .
die Nummer Zwei im Vatikan , dass ein Zusammenhang zwischen Homosexualität und Pädophilie bestehe ( queer.de berichtete ) . ( dk )
Way back in the late '90s and early 2000s , many Perl fans could rattle off a list of big projects using Perl : Slashdot , Amazon.com , IMDB .
Eyebrows popped up ( maybe at one point ) , as if the fact that billions of dollars of online sales went through Perl were validation of a language .
Perhaps it is .
Today much of the online Perl community discussion reads as reactionary , at least to me .
Some random Internet argument will degrade into " Perl ?
Is n't that insert negative description here ? " versus " Nuh uh , Perl is n't insert negative description here ! "
Me , I 'd rather hear about interesting new projects written in Perl .
Take the recent Duck Duck Go written in Perl story .
Repeat this a few dozen times ( especially with new projects created in the past year or two ) and responses will move from " Perl ?
People still use that ? " to " Wow , people who know Perl can certainly do a lot of interesting things ! "
I 'd rather see the latter message spread than almost any other marketing message — so tell the world , what are you working on with Perl ?

President Obama Warns Don't Celebrate Ending Oil Leak Yet Scientists monitor well to make sure oil not leaking into ocean floor .
July 16 , 2010  -- President Obama called the cap on the gulf oil leak " good news " today , but he cautioned that the job of ending the massive oil leak is not yet complete .
" There were a lot of reports coming out in the media that seemed to indicate , ' Well , maybe this thing is done , ' " he said .
" We wo n't be done until we actually know that we 've killed the well and that we have a permanent solution in place , " he said in the White House Rose Garden before heading off to a Maine vacation .
The president was referring to BP 's successful attempt -- so far -- to place a tight cap on the busted oil well and for the first time in 87 days prevent the underwater gusher from pouring into the gulf .
BP called Thursday 's success a test to see if the device will withstand the pressure of the surging oil , or whether the oil is now leaking out somewhere else in the ocean bedrock .
" It 's important that we do n't get ahead of ourselves here , " Obama said today .
" You know , one of the problems with having this camera down there is that when the oil stops gushing , everybody feels like we 're done .
And we 're not . "
He said the well still has to be permanently plugged and there is the massive clean - up of areas polluted by the spill , which Obama said needs " better coordination on the ground along the shorelines . "
" But we are making steady progress , " the president said , " and I think the American people should take some heart in the fact that we 're making progress on this front . "
Scientists today and through the weekend will be combing the area of the leak , looking for evidence of oil seeping through the ocean floor .
" It 's premature to open the Champagne bottle , but this weekend we 'll know whether we contained the monster or not , " City University of New York physics professor and SyFy Channel host Michio Kaku told " Good Morning America " today .
There is no sign that the underwater pipe has burst , but scientists are keeping a close eye on the pipe 's pressure , currently on the low side at about 7,000 psi , or pounds per square inch .
A sudden drop in pressure , Kaku explained , means the oil has found another way out .
" So far , we do n't see that taking place , " he said .
The 150,000 - pound cap began to successfully contain the leak Thursday afternoon , holding back the oil that 's shooting upward with the force of 70 fire hoses .
For the time being , work on the relief wells , a mere 100 feet from their target , has been suspended out of fear the drilling could disrupt the pressure to the crippled well .
News of the cap 's success met with tepid applause at a Louisiana town hall .
" It 's a relief that there 's not oil coming into the gulf , " shrimper Darla Rocks said , " but not a relief as far as me making a living , not a relief as far as my future . "
Retired U.S. Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen noted that the cap was not a solution , and that work on the leak would continue .
" This is merely an intermediate step to contain the oil , pending finishing the relief wells and plugging the hole , " he said .
Kaku called the relief wells the " gold standard . "
" You choke it from the bottom , cap it from the top , " he said .
There were reportedly cheers and slaps on the back in the BP offices as workers realized they 'd finally stopped the leak after more than 200 millions of gallons of oil spewed into the ocean .
Live video of the leak showed no oil at the site where plumes of oil had been seen billowing into the Gulf since the disaster began April 20 .
At the White House , President Obama reacted to the news , saying , " I think it 's a positive sign .
We 're still in the testing phase .
I 'll have more to say on it tomorrow . "
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , a Republican , expressed cautious optimism in a statement .
" It is too early to declare victory . ... " Jindal said .
" Our battles do n't end even when the well is capped .
Millions of gallons of oil are still in the Gulf , and some estimates show that oil will continue to hit our shores for many more months or maybe even longer . "
Sucess in Stopping Leak Celebrated Cautiously
BP is now conducting step - by - stop tests of the massive , 150,000 pound cap on the wellhead , a process the company said could take up to 48 hours .
The company said it is fully possible that oil will escape again before the testing is done .
Engineers slowly ratcheted down the flow of oil this morning and afternoon , closing off three valves -- cutting the so - called kill line at 11:30 a.m. and then closing the choke line at 1:30 p.m. , BP executive Kent Wells wrote on the company Twitter account .
Wells called it a " critical milestone , " while stressing that it is not an assured success .
Oil could flow again , based on the results of well - integrity tests , looking for leaks , that will last anywhere from six to 48 hours .
BP is monitoring pressure readings minute by minute , with higher pressures indicating a successful seal .
Low pressures would indicate a leak .
If there is a leak , " they would have to start siphoning [ the oil ] off again to minimize the leak , " Darryl Bourgoyne , the director of LSU 's well research lab said today .
ABC News ' Russell Goldman , Bradley Blackburn , Ned Potter and Zunaira Zaki contributed to this report .
China Miéville was only 26 when his first novel , the dark urban fantasy King Rat , was published in 1998 — although it was his second book , 2000 ’s Perdido Street Station , that introduced his fantasy settings of Bas - Lag and New Crobuzon and catapulted him to cult notoriety in the science - fiction world .
At the ripe old age of 37 , he now has seven novels under his belt , the latest being the much lighter ( yet sporadically horrific ) urban fantasy Kraken .
Miéville may be too young to start looking back wistfully on his career , but Kraken in many ways feels like a summation of everything he ’s done to date :
Awash in science fiction , magic , horror , the occult , and plenty of mind - bending metaphysics , the book is a giddy playground fitted with almost every fixture of the fantastic he ’s installed in his past work — handled with the touch of a veteran writer who ’s somewhat come to grips with his own chaotic imagination .
Advertisement
Fun , funny , and full of puns , Kraken also mitigates Miéville ’s somewhat justified reputation as a writer whose baroque tangle of prose , ideas , and ideology sometimes gets the better of him .
As such , Kraken is a dramatic departure from last year ’s The City & The City , a stunning crime noir set in two fictional European city - states that coexist in the exact same geographical space .
Kraken takes place in Miéville ’s native London — a city he ’s taken great liberties with in King Rat and his bestselling young - adult novel , Un Lun Dun — while staying rooted in pop culture in a way that none of his prior books are ; among Kraken ’s many geek - chic shoutouts are a working Star Trek phaser and references to famed British sample - punk band Pop Will Eat Itself .
The week of Kraken ’s release , Miéville spoke with The A.V.
Club about self - consciousness , nostalgia , and what it was like toying around with the mack - daddy of all zap - guns .
The A.V. Club : The City & The City came across as a careful , tightly controlled book .
Kraken , on the other hand , feels much more like an eruption .

China Miéville : [ Laughs . ]
I was wondering how you might gloss that over .
Kraken is a very undisciplined book .
That ’s a gamble .
If it does n’t come off , it ’s disastrous .
But there are pleasures , I think , to a meandering lack of discipline that you ca n’t get the other way , and vice versa .
You gain something and you lose something .
My second book , Perdido Street Station , was the one that a lot of people really , really liked , and it was tremendously sort of rumbustious and ill - disciplined .
I feel like I ’ve been getting increasingly disciplined since then , and some readers seem to miss that kind of amiable chaos .
What I wanted to do with Kraken is tap into what you ’ve kindly called an eruption .
I wanted to indulge that .
It does have a very different feel than The City & The City .
It obviously wo n’t work for everyone , but I always think about books like — and I do n’t mean this hubristically — Gravity ’s Rainbow .
If Gravity ’s Rainbow is anything , it ’s kind of this dreamlike meander .
The idea of saying to Pynchon , “ You know , you need to tighten this up , ” it would destroy it .
Kraken was an effort to tap into that same kind of pleasurable ramble .
In some ways , Kraken is more like Perdido , whereas The City & The City was a departure .
It ’s the kind of thing I ’d like to do a lot more of .
In some ways , this was getting back to what I was better known for .
AVC : After the tight discipline of The City & The City , was it a relief to be able to cut loose ?
Advertisement
CM : No , not really .
It felt strange , because the drive of that kind of rumbustiousness is different from book to book .
When I wrote Perdido , I was n’t really thinking about it in those terms .
I was 10 or 11 years younger , and I was splurging .
I think that ’s why people liked that book .
Part of its charm is its uncontrolled splurge .
Kraken is actually much , much more controlled and carefully constructed than that .
To a certain extent , it was very deliberate and self - conscious .
It did n’t feel like a relief .
Although it seems very different than The City & The City , it was , believe it or not , quite assiduously constructed in those terms .
AVC : Did it feel like a return to form in any way ?
CM : If anything , it felt more nostalgic .
It was a return to a kind of prose that I feel I ’ve been gently moving away from over the years , almost a “ once more with feeling ” kind of thing , even slightly melancholic in that way .
Advertisement
AVC : Kraken reads like a mix of almost everything you ’ve written before : the London underworld of King Rat , the sea monsters of The Scar , the police procedural of The City & The City , even some of the wordplay of Un Lun Dun .
Was it meant as a culmination ?
CM :
It did feel , for a variety of reasons , like the end of a certain phase of my writing .
It was a revisiting , almost a controlled coagulation of all those different things .
It was n’t set in New Crobuzon , but it did have the same sprawly vibe as those books .
And Kraken itself is much more chatty than the previous books .
The narratorial voice talks a lot to the reader .
The book will say things to you .
That ’s a technique that can be completely unbearable , but if you can get it right , it gives you a certain kind of feeling that you ca n’t necessarily get any other way .
I thought I could do that because Kraken is a kind of revisiting .
Like I said , it ’s almost melancholic in a certain way , kind of like a punctuation mark , a sort of breathing out or something .

AVC : Your work has lightened up considerably since the extreme earnestness of Iron Council .
Even The City & The City has touches of humor , and Kraken has a strong comedic undercurrent .
Was that a conscious turn ?
CM : I think so , very much .
I hope it does n’t read as self - conscious , because I do n’t like self - conscious fiction .
It ’s not a drive for me .
But I think it would be impossible for it not to be self - aware .
Of course , one is much more self - aware 12 years into something than at the beginning .
That ’s why there are a lot of , I hope , affectionate jokes about the kind of geek culture that I ’m around .
Those references are thrown in partly because we geeks love references — what do you spot , what do you get ?
It ’s interesting to hear Iron Council described as earnest , although I would n’t dispute it .
I hope the book felt serious .
It was a very important book to me , and I took it tremendously seriously .
I know a lot of people did n’t like it much , but it was a book I stand by very much .

I ’ve never felt like a nihilistic writer , and I ’m always surprised when people describe the stuff as bleak .
I understand , but it ’s not how I feel at all .
But with Kraken , I did want to do something more relaxed .
It ’s a shaggy - dog story .
Well , a shaggy - god story .
[ Laughs . ]
It ’s a game .
It ’s playful .
It riffs off London , and it does have some wordplay .
It ’s a comedy .
If you ’re riffing off those aspects of geek culture that are so well - established , it ’s impossible not to tread paths that have been done before .
You can either retain a kind of ingenuous , wide - eyed attitude and pretend you ’re doing something new , or you can just acknowledge it and play with it .
The end of the world , the apocalypse ?
Sure , we ’ve all seen that a thousand times before .
You might as well laugh at that , even as you try to take it seriously and do something new with it , as well .
But I do feel that Kraken is a comedy all the way through .
A fairly eschatological one .
AVC : You mentioned the geek - culture references in the book , and the most glaring one is the Star Trek phaser .
When that idea popped into your head , did you have any second thoughts about putting it in the book ?
Advertisement
CM : You mean , “ Could you not have restrained yourself ? ” [ Laughs . ]
I ’ll tell you , I ’ve never particularly been a Trek person .
I feel about Trek the way one feels about known , vaguely liked , but rather distant members of one ’s family .
I have respect for it , but it was never part of my cultural background the way things like Doctor Who and Blake ’s 7 were .
That said , you do n’t spent a certain amount of years in science fiction and not be saturated in Trek .
It does have kind of a cultural presence in a way that probably no other piece of science - fiction bric - a - brac does .
And I like it fine .
I have no bad feelings toward Trek .
But to some extent , that whole joke in Kraken — and this is me indulging my own amiable bickering in the field — is about the fact that there ’s a whole generation of NASA physicists who were inspired by Star Trek .
You hear this all the time , and it ’s often used as a piece of evidence by geeks of my tribe to justify science fiction .
“ Look , it ’s okay , we turn into serious and productive members of society . ”
I do n’t dispute that a lot of physicists really enjoy Star Trek , but I do n’t agree with the idea that Trek — or any science fiction — is in some way a serious scientific endeavor .
I am of the opinion that science fiction , whatever it thinks of itself , has very little to do with real science .
That ’s just a fond ideological impertinence we ’ve built up over the years .
It ’s actually completely bogus .
There ’s nothing wrong with that , though , and to that extent , I wanted to use Kraken to play a kind of game by simply having this argument about Trek .
Making it a wizard that activates the Star Trek phaser rather than a scientist was just my way of completely flipping that justification , which is wholly predicated on this slightly neurotic assertion of rationality — of which , of course , magic is the enemy .
Fine , let ’s just turn it on its head .
I ’m aware that all these things risk sounding very professorial , but it allows me to literally have a zap - gun in the book .
Advertisement
AVC : Not just a zap - gun — the zap - gun .
CM : Well , quite .
The granddaddy , the mack - daddy , of all zap - guns .
That noise it makes , that science - fictional noise , is like the noise of the TARDIS .
We all know exactly how it sounds , but it ’s completely impossible for the human vocal chords to mimic it .
There ’s a certain set of noises that you have in science fiction that are both absolutely familiar and completely un-representational , and the sound of a phaser is one of them .
Unlike the sound of a TIE fighter , which with a bit of practice , you can do pretty well .

AVC : Besides the Star Trek references , there are nods to pop culture of all kinds in Kraken , more so than any of your other books set in the real world .
One of the many music groups you mention is Pop Will Eat Itself , which is also name - checked in your acknowledgments alongside more obvious influences like Jules Verne and H.G. Wells .
How did PWEI rate as an inspiration ?
CM : In every book I write , I try to name - check the most prominent influences , or the most prominent conscious influences .
The Poppies were a big thing in the book for a variety of reasons .
It ’s impossible for me not to hear their music without feeling nostalgic , and as I said , Kraken feels like a rather nostalgic book .
But more overtly , I was influenced by their whole method of syncretic , über - geek coagulation .
They used sample technology , only without any of the stripped - down rigor of late - ’80s and early - ’90s hip - hop .
They just kind of threw everything into a dustbin and stirred .
It had that incredible enthusiasm of geek culture toward things we love .
Kraken in many ways felt the same .
It ’s a book constructed of samples , and that whole idea was looming as a heuristic .
Kraken is very aware of itself and its own ridiculousness , hopefully in an enjoyable way .
But part of that was also based on a pun .
One of the Poppies ’ great songs is “ Wise Up ! Sucker , ” and you know , what defines a squid more than its suckers ?
Advertisement
AVC : Oh , man , that ’s bad .
CM : [ Laughs . ]
That was almost the epigraph .
When we deal with squid and octopi in weird fiction , there ’s always this post - Lovecraft , overdetermined sense of awe and majesty .
We ’ve seen it before , many times .
I still want to get that awe , of course I do , but tapping into Pop Will Eat Itself was a way of saying to myself , “ Wise up , sucker . ”
Advertisement
AVC : With all the pop-culture signposts and London scenery , Kraken is more entrenched in the here - and - now than any of your books since King Rat .
Is there something perversely liberating about building a fantasy world within the real one ?
CM : Yes , there is .
But as with all these things , you gain and you lose .
You can make certain things possible that you ca n’t do in a more overtly fantastic setting , but you also remove certain possibilities .
King
Rat felt much more consciously , directly embedded in the specificity of London .
Kraken is set in London and has a lot of London riffs , but I think it ’s more like slightly dreamlike , slightly abstract London .
It ’s London as a kind of fantasy kingdom .
Although Kraken is obviously a very London book , it does n’t feel grounded in London the way King Rat does .
It ’s just as negative as it is positive .
It is n’t about “ What did I gain by setting this book in the real world ? ”
It ’s more a question of “ This is what I would lose if I set it in Bas - Lag . ”
Some people really want that .
It ’s a question I get asked a lot : “ When are you going to do a new Bas - Lag book ? ”
It ’s a setting I really love , and I almost certainly will do more stuff there .
But I think it would be much , much worse to do too many Bas - Lag novels than too few .
I worry about that tendency we have to demand more of the thing we love , and in getting it , spoiling it .
I do n’t want to do that .
For the first couple of Bas - Lag books , the pleasure of creation was a big part of it , whereas now , I think it would be lazy for me to use a default setting of Bas - Lag .
The Bas - Lag setting would have to be very necessary to the book , and in the absence of that , I would so hate to become a New Crobuzon factory .
So I wanted to steer away from that .
I could n’t do the particular kind of religious riffs I used in Kraken if it was set in a world where squid did n’t have the same cultural play they do in our world .
In many ways , this is a London Natural History Museum Book .
It was born out of the fact that they got a giant squid , and they put it in a tank , and it sits in the middle of the Darwin Centre .
That was the spur , more than anything else .
I just hope they do n’t take objection with the merry hell I played with depicting their working environment .

AVC : The City & The City was marketed as a book with a lot of crossover appeal between fantasy fans and mainstream fiction readers .
Kraken , though , is steeped in the fantastic .
Do you feel more comfortable in the geek world ?
CM :
The order in which books appear can be misleading a lot of the time .
Kraken and The City & The City were written more or less simultaneously .
It was n’t really a question of The City & The City causing a retreat to Kraken .
That said , of course people are aware of the order of their release , and that ’s likely how they ’re to be perceived .
The City & The City is much easier for someone who feels alienated by overt science fiction .
I often have people tell me , “ I do n’t really read that sort of thing , but if I were to read something of yours , which book should I start with ? ”
The City & The City is the book I would give people who do n’t have a background in the genre .
I was quite pleased with the order in which these two books came out .
As I was working on Kraken and preparing it for release , it began to feel more and more like a present for the hardcore fans , the ones who had been reading my stuff since Perdido .
Some of them I know felt like , “ Why is he dabbling in this kind of mainstream -y stuff like The City & The City ? ”
Now I obviously do n’t agree with that description , but that ’s still a group of readers to whom I have an enormous loyalty , and I wanted to give them something that was very much an homage and a paean to that kind of geek world .
The City & The City looked outward , and Kraken says , “ I ’m still China from the block . ”

The US authorities want Mr Naseer to face trial
The alleged leader of an al - Qaeda plot to bomb British and US targets , who won the right to stay in the UK , has been remanded in custody .
Abid Naseer appeared in court on Wednesday after the United States issued a warrant for his arrest .
The US Justice Department has linked a failed plot to bomb the New York subway to the alleged UK conspiracy .
The hearing was adjourned until 14 July to allow Mr Naseer to consult lawyers over a possible bail application .
A Home Office spokeswoman said a full extradition request must be received and submitted to court within 65 days .
Another hearing was set for 8 September , when a judge will decide if Mr Naseer , 24 , can be extradited .
Home Secretary Theresa
May will have the final say .
' Significant threat '
Mr Nasser appeared at the City of Westminster Magistrates ' Court on Wednesday night , accused of planning attacks on Manchester city centre and communicating with al - Qaeda leaders behind the plot .
Mr Naseer , who used to live in Manchester , is also accused of conspiracy to use a destructive device .
Melanie Cumberland , for the US government , said he was alleged to have been an al - Qaeda operative who was motivated by " deeply held religious beliefs " .
She said : " The conspiracy was co-ordinated by al - Qaeda leaders in Pakistan .
The targets were in the US and in the UK .
" Mr Naseer 's particular involvement in the conspiracy is alleged to be that he and a number of associates prepared to carry out attacks between 15 and 20 April in Manchester city centre . "
Setting out US objections to any future bail application , Miss Cumberland said Mr Nasser was a " key part " of the UK conspiracy and posed a " significant threat " to the national security of the UK .
The US believes senior figures in al - Qaeda had co-ordinated both operations from Pakistan .
Suspects on the run
In the US , Mr Naseer will be accused of conspiring alongside other al - Qaeda suspects to bomb the New York subway system last year .
Senior officials in the US said the plot was one of the most dangerous since the 9/11 terror attacks .
Two men have admitted planning to detonate home - made suicide bombs and a third is waiting for trial .
Several suspects remain on the run , possibly along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Confirming his arrest on Wednesday , a Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " Naseer 's extradition is sought by the United States government for the purposes of standing trial . "
Mr Nasser was arrested last April as part of a massive counter - terrorism operation in Liverpool and Manchester .
Deportation blocked
He was among 10 Pakistani nationals arrested .
The security services believed the men were planning to attack within days of their arrest , but Mr Naseer was not charged .
The government attempted to deport him and a second man , Ahmed Faraz Khan , 26 , to Pakistan , but a judge blocked it on the grounds they could be tortured or face death in Pakistan .
Mr Naseer won his appeal to stay in the UK in May although the Special Immigration Appeals Commission ( Siac ) said it believed Mr Naseer had posed a serious threat to national security .
It found he had been sending e-mails to an " al - Qaeda operative " in Pakistan - the e-mails were said to be at the heart of a plot to bomb targets in north - west England .
But Mr Justice Mitting said it would be wrong to return him to Pakistan .
At the time , Home Secretary Theresa May said she was disappointed but would not be appealing against the ruling .
She said : " We are now taking all possible measures to ensure they do not engage in terrorist activity . "
The coalition government later announced it was to create a commission to review the UK's Human Rights Act .
The M.S. River Rouge tour boat ran aground Thursday morning , north of Winnipeg , said RCMP .
About 69 passengers were on board the vessel on July 29 when it became stuck on either a sandbar or rock reef on the Red River , north of Miller Road , off of Highway 9 , said officers .
It was on its way to Lower Fort Garry when it hit shallow water around 11 a .m..
The boat 's owner , Kyriakos Vogiatzakis , told CTV News that the 450 - tonne boat was sitting in about two feet of water and said there were no marked buoys to indicate shallow water .
Vogiatzakis said safety is the first priority for the River Rouge .
No injuries were reported .
A tugboat was sent to the scene to try and pull the River Rouge out , but that attempt was unsuccessful .
The coast guard was sent out on Thursday evening .
Other boats helped transport passengers to shore about eight hours after the ship became stranded .
Vogiatzakis said the federal government should have placed buoys or markers in shallow water areas .
A spokesperson for Fisheries and Oceans issued a statement saying the captain of the River Rouge signed a waiver acknowledging that normal summer levels were not present and until the buoys are placed into position , the Red River is not considered safe for navigation .
The owner of the River Rouge was not available to respond to the statement on Friday afternoon .
Transportation Canada is investigating the incident .
The coast guard was working with the River Rouge 's owner to find ways of getting the boat out on Friday .

In the next five years , Android OS , is supposed to eventually rule the mobile phone industry according to Sanjay Jha , Motorola CEO .
Android OS will become the king of mobile phone industry
Sanjay Jha , Motorola CEO , expressed that in the following five years , Sanjay Jha said on Fortune Brainstorm
Tech convention that mobile phone industry will take the old road of PC , that means , by virtue of Apple 's iPhone to become the first big winner , but a standardized operating system will eventually dominate the mobile phone ( smart phone recorder recommended ) market .
Sanjay Jha did not directly answer the question that whether Motorola will launch tablet PCs , but he expressed that tablet PC is indeed an unique product .
By the way , Apple iPad might be replaced by seven tablet PCs , such as ModBook , Viliv X70 and so forth .
He considered that operating system is not the only one factor users should think over when buying a device , but it is a very important factor .
In addition to operating system , design , appearance and applications are also the important factors should considered .
For instance , Jha said , nearly 30 % consumers would not purchase those mobile phones without a full keyboard .
On the convention , Jha referred to the partnerships that has played a key role in the fate of Motorola .
Verizon needs to operate a mobile phone to hit the market , while , Google hopes to launch Android phones to make a blockbuster , Motorola needs to be successful .
By the way , iPhone 4 is defeated by Android phones in sales .
Later , Adobe has also added to the camp , as for the mobile platform , Adobe Flash is an important technology .
Also , Jha expressed although there are different nuclear viewpoints between Motorola and Google , their cooperation does not stop .
Google is supposed to standardize Android ( Android converter recommended ) to support more wide environment , while , Motorola needs diversity in its own equipments .
When asked if Motorola will launch its own operating system , Jha said that , at present , , and in the long term , there will be " more than 3 , less than 7 " systems turning up in the mobile phone industry .
He believes that unless Motorola will succeed in creating a good business system around the mobile phone operating system , they will not set foot in this area .

A commenter named Marcus Nunes just sent me one of the most chilling quotations I have ever read , and it was from the minutes of a Fed meeting .
But first a bit of background .
In October 2008 the Fed made the same mistake as in early 1937 ; they put into effect regulations that increased the demand for bank reserves , just at the moment we were entering a recession .
The 1937 action was actually more justifiable , because the recession was not yet visible .
In both cases many economists made a logical error .
In 1937 they assumed that higher reserve requirements would n’t be a problem because banks had lots of excess reserves — forgetting that they held ERs for a reason .
In 2008 most economists focused on interest rates as the indicator of monetary policy , not expectations of future policy actions .
The interest on reserves ( IOR ) program did not immediately raise rates , but did prevent them from immediately falling to zero .
Much worse , it made future QE much less effective , as markets understood that any future increases in the monetary base would now be held as excess reserves .
Now the Fed is considering eliminating IOR as a way of stimulating the economy .
Of course if they do that , it will be an implicit admission that the October 2008 action was contractionary in effect , and it will go down in the history books as an even worse mistake than the 1937 RR increase .
Will the Fed be willing to “ lose face ” and admit its error ?
My wife tells me that the Chinese do n’t like to lose face .
I assure her that we do n’t have that problem here , Americans have no difficulty in admitting their mistakes and moving on .
But the quotation that Marcus sent me has caused me to re-evaluate my view of Americans .
Could the Fed really put losing face ahead of the well - being of hundreds of millions of Americans , many without jobs ?
It seems unthinkable , almost unimaginably cruel , but the following excerpt suggests that it did happen in 1937 .
Read it and then I ’ll explain why .
By the way , the opening and closing passage are from a paper by Orphanides .
On May 1 , 1937 , the final leg of the tightening was completed .
With that in place , excess reserves fell back to levels as low as had not been seen since several years earlier ( Figure 4 ) .
May 1937 also marked the peak of the incomplete expansion from the Great Depression of 1929 - 1932 .
The economy promptly returned to recession .
Though the extent of the sharp decline in activity was not immediately evident , by Fall it became fully clear to the Committee that the economy was thrown back to a severe recession , once again .
The following evaluation of the situation by Williams at the November 1937 meeting is informative , both for offering a frank admission that the FOMC apparently wished for a slowdown to occur and also for outlining the case that the recession , nonetheless , had nothing to do with the monetary tightening that preceded it .
Particularly enlightening is the reasoning offered by Williams as to why a reversal of the earlier tightening action would be ill advised .
“ We all know how it developed .
There was a feeling last spring that things were going pretty fast … we had about six months of incipient boom conditions with rapid rise of prices , price and wage spirals and forward buying and you will recall that last spring there were dangers of a run-away situation which would bring the recovery prematurely to a close .
We all felt , as a result of that , that some recession was desirable …
We have had continued ease of money all through the depression .
We have never had a recovery like that .
It follows from that that we ca n’t count upon a policy of monetary ease as a major corrective . …
In response to an inquiry by Mr. Davis as to how the increase in reserve requirements has been in the picture , Mr. Williams stated that it was not the cause but rather the occasion for the change . …
It is a coincidence in time . …
If action is taken now it will be rationalized that , in the event of recovery , the action was what was needed and the System was the cause of the downturn .
It makes a bad record and confused thinking .
I am convinced that the thing is primarily non-monetary and I would like to see it through on that ground .
There is no good reason now for a major depression and that being the case there is a good chance of a non-monetary program working out and I would rather not muddy the record with action that might be misinterpreted .
( FOMC Meeting , November 29 , 1937 .
Transcript of notes taken on the statement by Mr. Williams . ) ”
The Federal Reserve made every effort to build a convincing case that the cause of the 1937 downturn could be more than accounted for by factors other than the monetary tightening and that policy action by the rest of the government and not by the Federal Reserve were needed to restore prosperity .
I suppose someone will say that Williams is denying that the RR increase caused the 1937 depression .
Yes , he ’s denying it , but you ’d have to be even more naive than me ( and that ’s a pretty bad insult by the way ) to believe he is sincere :
1 . He admits that the policy was intended to be contractionary , indeed intended to cause a “ recession . ”
2 . By November 1937 it was clear that the “ recession ” was becoming a depression .
3 . They are discussing lowering RRs as an expansionary device .
4. Later on when the depression got worse ( in 1938 ) they did lower RRs .
Let ’s put him on the couch :
“ We all felt , as a result of that , that some recession was desirable ”
I.e. , it was n’t just my fault , we all felt that way .
If action is taken now it will be rationalized that , in the event of recovery , the action was what was needed and the System was the cause of the downturn .
Do I even need to comment ?
It makes a bad record and confused thinking .
Yes , we must n’t let the public become “ confused . ”
I am convinced that the thing is primarily non-monetary and I would like to see it through on that ground .
There is no good reason now for a major depression
A depression ca n’t be happening now , because that would mean I was wrong .
I would rather not muddy the record with action that might be misinterpreted
Muddy the record , or muddy my reputation ?
A depression did occur , as NGDP fell roughly 5 % .
To give you an idea of just how bad it was , the largest yearly decrease since then was only 1.7 % .
BTW , that occurred in 2009 , just after the Fed started the IOR .
Although I am generally a non-interventionist , for some strange reason I supported the Iraq War .
( Actually 6 or 7 reasons , none of which seem very good today . )
Sometimes in conversation I will mention how the Iraq War was a mistake , and people will say “ But I thought you supported the war . ”
And I think to myself , “ Yes , and your point is . . . ” Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet , admit your mistake , and move on .
I ’ve led a sheltered life .
I was n’t in the room when Nixon conferred with his advisers after Watergate , or Kennedy met with his legal team after Chappaquiddick .
So I am pretty naive about people .
This transcript was a real eye - opener for me .
You probably think that I ’m getting ready to accuse the Fed of being evil if they do n’t get rid of the IOR .
I ’m afraid my naivete is so deeply ingrained that within days I ’ll again be assuming they are well - intentioned civil servants doing the best they can .
You guys are free to draw your own conclusions .

Great game , very funny .
Despite what some think , I still consider it a justified stab against Christianity , or religion in general .
The fact that no matter how many effort you put into the miracles and the apostles you gather in the process , Jesus is still fucked ;)

Kenny & Zuke 's 1038 SW Stark Street , Portland OR 97205 ( map ) ; 503-222-3354 ‎
Cheese fries : been there , eaten that .
But pastrami cheese fries ?
It 's hard not to notice them under the " Sides & a la Carte " section of the Kenny & Zuke 's menu .
The words are practically yelling at you , highlighted in a special yellow box with curly font and " ONLY $ 8.50 . "
Once you spot them , you really do n't read anything else .
Noodle kugel , mhmm , Sabrett hot dog , fine sure .
" PASTRAMI CHEESE FRIES . "
ORDER ME , they say .
So we did .
Kenny & Zuke 's claims to have some of the best pastrami in the world .
Well , the world , if you do n't count New York .
Ken Gordon and Nick Zukin opened the deli in 2007 and have been reinterpreting Jewish deli fare , still applying rigorous standards to classic preparations ( like pastrami ) in a Portland - hip , modern diner space .
How can you eat pastrami here ?
Oh , let us count the ways .
Classic sandwich on rye , pastrami burger , reuben , reuben salad ( salad in name only : pastrami , swiss , sauerkraut , rye croutons , and Russian dressing ) and , what we 're here to tell you about today , the cheese fries .
At first , you stare at it .
Which angle do you .. where does one .. reach for ... fork ?
Is this a fork 's job ?
No .
And just go for it .
There 's about as many strands of lusciously fall - aparty pastrami trimmings as there are fries .
The pastrami - to - fries ratio is actually kind of frightening .
How much gets in there ?
" As much as we can fit ! " said co-owner Nick Zukin .
You could easily make a sandwich or two with all that meat .
The smoky , crusty - edged bits are piled on top , underneath , and in between the giant mass of melted Swiss - smothered fries .
And the fries : though they get overshadowed by the ' strami , they are perfect : McDonald 's caliber of crisp , golden , and salted .
The genius idea came to Zukin one late ( like after all the bars closed late ) weekend night when he wanted to use all the fatty , meaty , super - intensely - flavored pastrami scraps .
We tried really hard to finish the plate .
Really , really hard .
But even three very serious eaters had to request a take - home box — and the remains were still popping out of that .
Pastrami cheese fries : you win this time .
Alright , so maybe you win every time .

Mon Existence
Accusé d’un immense délit d’émotion ,
Je me livre à vous sans aucune abstraction .
Mes sentiments sont aussi vitaux que de respirer ,
Privé d’amour et de tristesse , je ne peux exister ,
Car le souffle de la vie n’est qu’une horloge
Qui égraine les heures sans éprouver d’éloge .
Mes rêves sont mon seul bien ,
Marche doucement vaurien ,
Car tu marches sur mes rêves ,
Mes émotions n’ont pas de trêves .
Dans ce monde froid et sans cœur brûlé moi vifs ,
Car mon âme l’aime , je ne connais pas d’alternatif ,
Une vie , sans elle , serait pour moi une douce mort ,
Car à mainte reprise elle m’apporte son réconfort .
Même si vous me prenez ma vie , ne la touchez pas ,
Car sinon , même l ’enfer serait un monde délicat .
Mes rêves sont mon seul bien ,
Marche doucement vaurien ,
Car tu marches sur mes rêves ,
Mes émotions n’ont pas de trêves .
Mon âme est perdue dans un tourbillon d’émotions ,
De mes sentiments je ne peux pas en faire abstraction ,
Ils sont ancrés en la profondeur de mon âme et conscience ,
Et même si je lui livre se trop plein d’amour sans élégance ,
Je peux lui avouer qu’elle est toujours dans mes pensées ,
Et que pas un instant , de mon amour pour elle je n’ai hésité .

PostScriptum
Pearson used to be a dump .
The idea of a cultural renaissance in Toronto once seemed like a cruel joke , a pipe dream imposed on the public by crazed cultural activists .
Waterfront revitalization ?
C’mon .
Prospects for that seemed as improbable as winning an Olympic bid .
Big
Things do happen in these parts .
Slowly , yes .
But with perseverance and a coalition of grassroots and opinion makers , we inch along .
So , be bold and think big when it comes to transit , probably the region ’s toughest and most expensive nut to crack .
That ’s the message from planner Joe Berridge delivered to about 100 transportation advocates convened by the Toronto City Summit Alliance yesterday .
“ Who could ’ve believed 20 years ago that we could spend a billion dollars on culture ? ” he asked , referring to the opera house and additions and remakes of the museum , art gallery and other institutions .
“ Be bold .
Bold works .
Toronto is a big , global city .
( On transit ) we recognize the scale of the problem , we are forging partnerships , we have a financing plan and there ’s no question we have the money in this town .
“ Toronto is one huge , enormous city .
We are a global leader . ”
Most accept the “ global leader ” tag .
Toronto ranks Number 9 among all cities in the world on Google City searches — ahead of Rome , Tokyo , Milan , Amsterdam , Frankfurt .
But wealthy enough to fund our transit needs ? — with the help of federal and provincial governments , of course .
That ’s the Toronto region ’s next big challenge — to move its people across the sprawling region .
Most citizens in the GTA and Hamilton do n’t need smart boards and graphs and a media campaign to inform them of the fact ; they live it daily from home to work or school .
The question for the next decade and beyond is this :
Is Toronto up to the task of wrestling the problem into submission ?
Solutions will cost billions of dollars and likely involve controversial funding tools , like road tolls .
Citizens will exchange angry words .
Tempers will flare at public meetings .
And some politicians will be unable to resist exploiting the issue .
Still , congestion will be as pressing a public policy challenge a decade from now as it is today .
That ’s because all the trends are going the wrong way .
Or , as a recent report puts it :
“ Traffic congestion is going from bad to worse at an increasing rate . ”
The local wakeup call — if one was needed — must have been the Board of Trade report in March that showed commuting time in the Toronto region had reached 80 minutes .
That ’s slower than the slow times in Los Angeles , the postcard city for traffic jams .
Ouch .
And the pressure of more people and more cars is expected to continue .
Projections show the Toronto area will add the population of Montreal in the next 25 years .
Another 1.5 million cars are coming .
A region - wide transportation plan from the provincial agency Metrolinx requires $ 50 billion .
By 2015 , the plan will be short $ 4 billion per year , after accounting for provincial and federal funds .
This means at some point , citizens here will have to pay to ease the congestion .
Our politicians are afraid to suggest road tolls , parking levies , congestion fees and various “ taxes ” to arrest the creeping congestion now clearly evident .

Attendees at yesterday summit debated as many as 12 options .
The sooner we start talking about them in polite company , the earlier the solutions arrive .
So far , the conversation includes very little that drivers find attractive .
That must change .
Opinion makers must mine options that have at least grudging appeal .
Otherwise , Toronto the global dynamo will choke on its success .
Royson James usually appears Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday .

The final 1.2 release will take place on Monday , May 17 , 2010 .
Between now and Monday , the only things we 'll be accepting ( barring any release - blocking bugs -- but we 're not aware of any ) are updated translation files ; if you 've got translations you have n't yet submitted , please get them into Trac as quickly as possible so we can deal with them before the final release .
Hundreds of dogs and their owners have descended on the Sydney Opera House for a concert specifically for canines .
Organisers say the event , the work of American musician and artist Laurie Anderson , is the first of its kind .
Ms Anderson called it " an inter - species social gathering on a scale never seen before in Australia " .
It featured the cries of whales and high - pitched electronic sounds inaudible to human ears , accompanied by a bass guitar and violin .
For an hour or so Australia 's most recognisable building became a giant kennel .
The sounds sent some agitated pets into a frenzy , while others seemed rather bemused .
" Most dogs are fine with it but we had to move away because he was getting a little bit freaked out by the whale noises , " said one dog owner .
Ms Anderson said it was one of the best moments of her career .
" Supposedly , they are sort of like bats and whales that they can hear super high things and they can .
Their hearing is so much better than ours .
" We did n't want to do something that humans could n't hear too , so we chose a different bunch of things .
A lot of dogs seem to enjoy classical music , frankly . "
While the dogs ' owners certainly enjoyed the show , we 'll never know what their four - legged friends made of it .
These pets were a tough crowd .
There were plenty of barks , howls and yawns along with the occasional snarl as the Sydney Opera House witnessed a piece of canine musical history .
When it comes to bank - robbing gimmicks , Star Wars beats distraction - by - bouquet .
A thief dressed in a Darth Vader costume walked away with an unspecified amount of cash on Wednesday from a bank in Setauket .
His commitment to the costume was somewhat mitigated by his camouflage pants and gun ( no light saber , dude ? ) although he does get style points for wearing a cape .
Apparently one customer thought the get - up was amusing and “ started joshing ” with “ Darth Robber ” ( nice one , Daily News ! ) :
“ The customer thought it might have been a joke , and not a serious attempt at a robbery , ” Suffolk County police Detective Sgt. William Lamb said .
Unamused , the robber ordered the man to the ground .
We could understand giving lip to C - 3PO ( or even Chewbacca ) , but if you ’re bold enough to mess with Darth Vader , you ’re basically asking to end up on the floor .
While we can’t condone armed robbery , here ’s hoping Darth made a clean getaway and is plotting a follow - up , possibly dressed as Boba Fett .
If he shows up as Jar - Jar , a Phantom Menace - hating vigilante just might take him out .

( CNN ) -- Police in Collierville , Tennessee , are investigating the disappearance of a former professional basketball player and say " there is a high level of concern " in the search to find him .
Lorenzen Wright , 34 , who played 13 seasons in the NBA , has not been seen or heard from since July 18 when he visited his ex-wife and their children in Collierville , near Memphis , investigators said .
Collierville police spokesman Mark Heuberger told CNN that Wright 's mother reported him missing on July 22 .
" We 're taking it very , very seriously , " Heuberger said , " and there is a high level of concern . "
" His mom made the report because she felt it was unusual that he did not contact his children for an extended period of time , that 's what made her prompt to contact the police , " he added .
" This is not like him , " Wright 's sister , Savia Archie , told CNN Tuesday .
" I have n't talked to my brother in nine days .
He does n't go without talking to family .
" I 'm trying to keep my faith in the world and that he 's not in trouble and hopefully he will come home .
He 's my big brother .
Without him , there 's no me . "
Heuberger cautioned that there is no indication that Wright was the victim of a crime .
" A red flag has not come up yet , at least ( as ) of today , that suggests any harm has come to him , " Heuberger said Tuesday
" Our detectives have talked to a lot of people -- former coaches , players , sports agents -- and continue to follow leads given by the public , " Heuberger said , " and we 're working very close to the family . "
Archie , Wright 's sister , described her brother as a loving son , father and uncle .
" My sister had a baby shower last Sunday and he was supposed to come , " she said .
" Something had to have happened . "
The 6 - foot - 11 - inch Wright , who lives in Atlanta , was a forward / center for several teams during his professional basketball career .
He played with the Los Angeles Clippers , Atlanta Hawks , Memphis Grizzlies and Sacramento Kings .
He was with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2008 - 2009 , his last year in the NBA .
Wright , who has six children , completed his degree at the University of Memphis in 2003 , according to the official NBA website .
Police are asking anyone with information on his whereabouts to call 901-853-3207 .
Within a year or two , GM will begin offering the Volt with less content and a lower price point .
The base sticker price gets customers a very well equipped car that includes standard navigation with a seven - inch screen , an eight - year / 100,000 mile battery warranty , Bluetooth connectivity , Bose audio system and five years of OnStar service included .
The OnStar service , which includes turn - by - turn directions and mobile applications , normally costs $ 300 per year .
The only available options for the Volt are heated leather seats , chrome wheels , three premium paint colors and rear park assist .
We asked GM spokesman Randy Fox about the high - level of standard equipment .
When the automaker 's two - mode hybrid SUVs were launched , they were only available in a highly contented form like this , which led to very high sticker prices and subsequently low sales .
According to Fox , these early build combinations of the Volt are being kept simple and the expectation is that there will be sufficient demand to absorb them .
Within a year or two as production ramps up , GM will begin offering the Volt with less content and a lower price point .
Apparently this is the cost of being an early adopter .
Based on the lease price , GM is clearly confident that the Volt will be successful and retain a high residual value at the end of the three - year lease term .
The Volt goes on sale in December of this year in seven U.S. markets , and GM expects it to be available nationally within 12 - 18 months .
Despite the price point , enough initial demand is expected that at least some dealers will be tempted to charge an extra markup .
Although the automaker has no real power to stop dealers from charging whatever they think the market will bear , Ewanick acknowledged that dealers will be discouraged from doing that .
Ewanick also outlined the ordering process for the Volt .
Initially 600 Chevrolet dealers in the launch markets will be certified to sell and service the Volt .
Customers can find these dealers through the http://getmyvolt.com website .
Once they find a local dealer , the process proceeds much like ordering any other car with customers paying a deposit and filing order forms .
Once the car has been ordered , Volt customer service advisers will contact the customer and take them through a survey to determine if they are eligible for one of the free Department of Energy - funded home charging units from Coulomb Technologies or Ecotality .
If they do n't live in one of the eligible areas , they will be referred to another charger supplier that GM will be working with .
Because the Volt 's 16 kilowatt - hour battery pack can be charged in just 8 - 10 hours from a 110 volt outlet , customers do n't actually have to get a 220 - volt charger for the Volt , potentially saving them several thousand dollars compared to a battery EV like the Leaf .
GM will be naming its preferred charger supplier and a price closer to the car 's on - sale date .
Customers will also be able to use the http://getmyvolt.com site to monitor the build of their vehicle and get more information about the car even after delivery .
So , the big question remains :
GOODWOOD , England , July 2 ( Reuters ) - Red Bull have given technical head Adrian Newey a race - winning Formula
One car of his own as a thank you present for turning them into a title - chasing team .
The team said last year ’s RB5 car , handed over at the Goodwood Festival of Speed on Friday for the Briton to drive up the hill , was in appreciation of Newey ’s achievements since Formula One ’s top designer joined them in 2006 .
“ It ’s a really significant car for us , as it ’s the first model type that won six races for Red Bull Racing last year , ” said team boss Christian Horner .
“ Adrian ’s made a mess of his lawn with several different cars from his collection , but this one will definitely tear the grass up , ” he joked , referring to Newey ’s front garden celebrations at home after Red Bull took their first win in China last year .
Newey , whose cars have won four of the nine races so far this season with German Sebastian Vettel and Australian Mark Webber , said he was overcome by the gesture and intended to make good use of the gift .
“ The plan now is to club together with some other guys I know who are lucky enough to have cars and hire a circuit , preferably a modern one with a bit of run off where I can enjoy driving the car without worrying about having a spin in front of a crowd , ” he said .
Researchers have discovered stone tools in Norfolk , UK , that suggest that early humans arrived in Britain nearly a million years ago - or even earlier .
The find , published in the journal Nature , pushes back the arrival of the first humans in what is now the UK by several hundred thousand years .
Environmental data suggests that temperatures were relatively cool .
This raises the possibility that these early Britons may have been among the first humans to use fire to keep warm .
They may also have been some of the earliest humans to wear fur clothing .

With the ancient tools were plant material , including a pine cone ( top right ) that provided clues about climate
The discoveries were made in Happisburgh , in the north of Norfolk .
At the time there was a land bridge connecting what is now southern Britain with continental Europe .
There are no early human remains , but the researchers speculate that the most likely species was Homo antecessor , more commonly - and possibly appropriately - known as " Pioneer Man " .
Remains of the species have been found in the Atapuerca region of northern Spain , and dated to 0.8 - 1.2 million years ago .
So the species could well have been in Britain at around that time , according to Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London .
" If the climate was good and the land bridge was there , there 's no real reason they could n't have come ( to Britain ) as far back as 1.2 million years ago , " he told BBC News .

One million years ago , a land bridge linked the UK to continental Europe
Pioneer Man was much like our own species in that it walked upright , used tools and was a hunter gatherer .
But physically the species looked rather different .
It had a smaller brain , strong brow ridges and big teeth , with some primitive features such as a flat face and no prominent chin on the lower jaw .
' Real pioneers '
The discovery raises many new questions , such as how these creatures dealt with the cold winters that existed at the time .
Scientists have also speculated that they may have used shelters and clothing .
It also raises the possibility that Britain was the first place where fire was used in a controlled way for warmth .
" Although we do n't have the evidence for fire or of clothing to get through the winters up here , I think they must have had some extra adaptations , " said Professor Stringer .
" I think the evidence suggests that they were living at the edge of the inhabited world in a really challenging environment and indeed they were real pioneers living here in Britain , nearly a million years ago , " he said .
The research was led by Dr Nick Ashton of the British Museum , London , as part of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain ( AHOB ) project .

The discovery suggests that early humans may have adapted to the cold
" The discovery is immensely surprising because we are dealing with an incredibly early date , " Dr Ashton said .
He added that the environmental data that indicated the relatively low temperatures was " even more surprising " .
" It 's unusual to find humans in such a cool climate this far north at this very early date , " he said .
This area of Norfolk was quite a different place one million years ago .
" The [ River ]
Thames was flowing through this area .
And at the site we have sediments laid down by the Thames , " he explained .
Pioneer man was eventually wiped out by an Ice Age .
These occurred about every 100,000 years , and each time that happened Britain was depopulated .
As conditions became more benign , a new group of humans arrived .
There were at least eight different waves of people that came in and died out before the last wave , which is the one that survives today .

If their aim was to break him , his interrogators apparently succeeded .
By late November 2002 , Mohammed al - Qahtani — a suspected Al Qaeda operative sometimes described as the 20th hijacker — was hearing voices , talking to imaginary people , and spending hours on end cowering in a corner of his Guantanamo cell with a sheet draped over him .
Qahtani had been subjected to months of extreme isolation in a cell that was floodlit 24 - 7 .
And that was before military officials approved an interrogation plan designed to wear down his resistance .
The blueprint for his interrogation program — which included 20 - hour daily sessions , sensory deprivation tactics , and a campaign of sexual humiliation — was drawn up by a pair of military mental health professionals who first arrived at Gitmo thinking they were going to counsel troubled US soldiers .
Instead , the two men were corralled into service as members of a Behavioral Science Consultation Team ( BSCT ) , developing strategies that pushed detainees to the psychological brink — and sometimes beyond .
The role of doctors , psychiatrists , and psychologists in interrogations has been a source of considerable controversy , since it seemingly violates the medical professions ’ central tenet : “ Do no harm . ”
Over the years , a handful of efforts to hold caregivers accountable for complicity in detainee abuse have come up empty .
But human rights advocates are hoping this track record will soon change .
On Wednesday , the San Francisco - based Center for Justice and Accountability ( CJA ) and Harvard Law School ’s International Human Rights Clinic filed separate complaints against two former Gitmo shrinks with their state licensing boards .
CJA ’s complaint targets Maj . John Francis Leso , an army psychologist who from June 2002 to January 2003 led the Gitmo BSCT involved in Qahtani ’s interrogation .
It accuses Leso , who is licensed in New York , of “ gross incompetence , ” “ gross negligence , ” and “ conduct exhibiting a moral unfitness to practice the profession . ”
According to the document , Leso “ used his training in psychology to design interrogation techniques that manipulate the psychological condition of a detainee , induce Stockholm syndrome in the detainee , and modify the detainee ’s behavior . ”
The complaint , a year in the making , was filed in conjunction with New York psychologist Steven Reisner — an outspoken critic of peers who have assisted in interrogations .
CJA ’s aim is to force an investigation by the state board , which could choose to strip Leso of his credentials .
Leso arrived at Gitmo in 2002 as a member of an Army Combat Stress Control Team .
Soon after , he and two other members of his unit learned they would not , in fact , be caring for soldiers but rather consulting on interrogations — something they knew little about .
“ Nobody really knew what we were supposed to do , ” Army psychiatrist and Leso team member Maj .
Paul Burney acknowledged to the Senate Armed Services Committee during its later inquiry [ PDF ] into detainee treatment .
Burney has said that during his Gitmo stint , detainees were repeatedly grilled about links between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein — the apparent result of pressure by top Bush administration officials in search of a smoking gun .
When the interrogators were unable to produce any such evidence , pressure mounted to “ resort to measures that might produce more immediate results . ”
Ultimately , Leso and his team were dispatched to Fort Bragg to learn from the Army ’s Survival , Evasion , Resistance , and Escape program , which teaches soldiers to withstand harsh physical and psychological interrogations if captured .
One evening in October 2002 , Leso and Burney took what they ’d learned from SERE — plus tactics they just “ made up , ” according to Burney — and wrote a memo that would become the basis for Gitmo ’s standard interrogation procedure .
They prefaced the memo with a cautionary note , writing that the “ most effective interrogation strategy is a rapport - building approach ” and that physical or fear - based methods were likely to produce inaccurate information .
( Indeed , Qahtani would later claim that he lied during brutal interrogations . )
They also warned that the some of the techniques they were outlining could cause “ irreversible ” emotional or physical harm .
The memo described three categories of tactics of escalating brutality , including isolation , stress positions , temperature extremes , daily 20 - hour interrogations , exposure to nerve - shattering white noise , and devising scenarios to make a detainee believe he would be tortured or killed if he did n’t give up information .
All of the above were applied copiously to Qahtani , who was hospitalized multiple times as a result .
On one occasion , his interrogation recommenced while he was being transported by ambulance from the hospital .
In addition to Leso ’s role in recommending some of the techniques applied to Qahtani , the CJA complaint charges that he also supervised and participated in some of the sessions .
One of the most significant pieces of evidence , says CJA lawyer Kathy Roberts , is an entry in Qahtani ’s interrogation log ( leaked to Time magazine in 2005 ) that is “ without question a moment of misconduct .
He ’s actively in the room , actively working on applying abusive tactics . ”
During that session , Leso ( referred to as “ Maj. L ” in the logs ) instructed Qahtani ’s interrogators to place him in a swivel chair “ to keep him awake and stop him from fixing his eyes on one spot in the booth . ”
Leso was reportedly present for other sessions , too , including one in which a military dog was brought in to intimidate the detainee .
“ Dr. Leso ’s personal participation in this interrogation not only indicates that he promoted the use of these methods , but also itself constitutes a clear violation of minimum standards of professional ethics , ” the complaint charges .
Adds Roberts : “ He knew he was doing harm .
And I think it ’s really incredible if you think about the condition [ Qahtani ] was in and that he was overseeing that interrogation . ”
The second complaint [ PDF ] filed Wednesday targets retired army Col. Larry James , Leso ’s onetime boss at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , who succeeded him at Guantanamo Bay and went on to become the chief behavioral scientist at Abu Ghraib prison .
The Harvard group , on behalf of four clients , is going after James ’ license in Ohio — he is also credentialed in Louisiana , where the state psychology board ’s refusal to investigate an ethics complaint sparked a legal battle .
( This week ’s actions follow a complaint last month in Texas .
In that case , lawyers representing a Texas psychologist targeted James Elmer Mitchell , a CIA - contracted psychologist who took part in brutal interrogations — these included the questioning of Abu Zubaydah , a detainee who was waterboarded at least 83 times in a single month at a secret Thai prison . )
James , now dean of the Wright State University School of Professional Psychology in Dayton , Ohio , recalls his experiences at Gitmo and Abu Ghraib in his book Fixing Hell .
Leso , he writes , told him he “ had received increasing pressure to teach interrogators procedures and tactics that were a challenge to his ethics as a psychologist and moral fiber as a human being .
He was devastated to have been a part of this . ”
For his part , James has strongly denied complicity in abusive tactics — his presence at Gitmo and Abu Ghraib was to ensure that detainees were treated humanely .
“ It was psychologists who fixed the problems and not caused it , ” he has said .
But his critics counter that brutal physical and psychological interrogation methods were in widespread use during James ’ time at Guantanamo , where he served in 2003 and again in 2007 .
“ There is absolutely no question that men and boys were physically and psychologically abused as a matter of policy in Guantanamo during , between , and following his deployments , ” notes the Harvard program ’s 55 - page complaint .
It accuses James of complicity in “ causing psychological devastation to people he was duty - bound to protect ” and alleges that “ Dr. James and / or the BSCT members allegedly under his command and supervision helped to develop interrogation plans designed to exploit detainees ’ particular psychological weaknesses in order to ‘ break ’ them . ”
The Harvard complaint also claims James has made a range of misrepresentations , including the contention that his Gitmo team was “ concerned primarily with protecting detainees from harm . ”
Potentially more serious , it says he omitted his controversial deployments to Gitmo and Abu Ghraib when he applied for licensing in Ohio in 2008 — and left this information off the curriculum vitae he submitted to Wright State University as well .
( His bio on the school ’s website makes no mention of his experience on the Army ’s behavioral science teams . )
James declined to comment , but Wright State University spokesman George Heddleston said in a statement to Mother Jones : “ A similar complaint filed in Ohio in 2008 was dismissed by the Ohio Board of Psychology .
And in June of this year a complaint filed with the State Board of Examiners of Psychologists in Louisiana , in which Dr. James is also licensed , was adjudicated in appeals court after the Board declined to act following an investigation . ”
( Brian Childs , a lawyer representing Trudy Bond , the Ohio psychologist who filed the Louisiana complaint , says no investigation took place .
“ The Board refused to examine the merits of the complaint . ” )
Deborah Popowski , a legal fellow in Harvard ’s human rights program involved in drafting the complaint , points out that past complaints have been compiled by individuals like Bond ( who is also a party in the pending Ohio complaint ) , not lawyers .
“ There ’s plenty that should concern the board , ” she says , describing the complaint as “ a second wave of accountability on this issue . ”
The human rights lawyers chose their targets carefully .
They honed in on psychologists , says Roberts , because of the field ’s ethical ambivalence around interrogation — the result of psychology ’s historical ties to the military .
By now , the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have drawn a clear ethical line on interrogations , barring members from taking part .
But the American Psychological Association — whose membership includes both therapist types and research - oriented behavioral scientists — has been reluctant to follow suit .
In 2008 , following a vote by a deeply divided membership , the association merely moved to bar members from participating in interrogations that are “ in violation of international and U.S. laws . ”
Holding individuals to account is just part of the plan .
“ The larger hope is to really change the role of psychologists in these kinds of interrogations , ” says Roberts .
“ Psychologists are not supposed to be harming people . ”
When it comes to the death penalty , aggravating factors are weighed against mitigating circumstances .
Well , you can bet Joseph Bennett , 54 , of Northampton , was pretty aggravated in recent days when someone stole an air conditioning unit from a building Bennett owns in the 1800 block of Weaversville Road in Hanover Township , Lehigh County .
If Pennsylvania State Police at Bethlehem catch the creep who ripped off the AC during one of the worst heat waves in the past 10 years , I say ask for death .
To get serious for just a second , excessive heat can and does kill people .
But , enough of that .
Stealing air conditioning when it 's needed most is a crime against humanity and should be treated most sternly by the law .
State police ask anyone who knows anything about the crime to call 610-861-2026 .

So- called “ anarchist ” pictured wearing Nike clothing
Paul Joseph Watson

An eyebrow - raising photograph of one of the anarchists who set fire to a Toronto police car during anti-G20 protests this past weekend shows him wearing Nike clothing , a potential indication that provocateurs dressed up as black - bloc “ anarchists ” were again employed by authorities to cause mayhem in order to justify a brutal police crackdown and crush free speech , as peaceful protesters were attacked and arrested while the anarchists who torched the cars were left alone .
The picture shows the two culprits who set fire to the police car congratulating each other and looking remarkably relaxed about potentially being caught by police considering what they had just done .
One of the men is wearing Nike pants – the distinctive logo of the company can be seen above his left pocket .
Why would a hardcore anarchists so dedicated to his cause that he is willing to torch a police car be wearing clothing made by a company that anarchists universally abhor , and one that has routinely been targeted by anarchists for well over a decade ?
The authorities certainly wasted no time in responding to the mayhem the anarchists helpfully generated for them with brute force .
After anarchists torched four police cars , reporters and other peaceful protesters were targeted with rubber bullets , with another Guardian journalist being repeatedly punched and elbowed by cops .
“ A newspaper photographer was shot with a plastic bullet in the backside , while another had an officer point a gun in his face despite identifying himself as a member of the media , ” reported the Canadian Press news agency .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Journalist Steve Paikin of public broadcaster TV Ontario described the brutal beating of the Guardian reporter .
“ As I was escorted away from the demonstration , I saw two officers hold a journalist .
The journalist identified himself as working for ‘ the Guardian . ’
He talked too much and pissed the police off .
Two officers held him a third punched him in the stomach .
Totally unnecessary .
The man collapsed .
Then the third officer drove his elbow into the man ’s back .
No cameras recorded the assault .
And it was an assault . ”
Paikin noted how middle class , peaceful demonstrators were being attacked and arrested by police , while the anarchists who provided them with the pretext to do so were nowhere to be seen .
“ The police just started arresting people .
I stress , this was a peaceful , middle class , diverse crowd .
No anarchists .
Literally more than 100 officers with guns pointing at the crowd .
Rubber bullets and smoke bombs ready to be fired .
Rubber bullets fired . ”
“ I have lived in Toronto for 32 years .
Have never seen a day like this .
Shame on the vandals and shame on those that ordered peaceful protesters attacked and arrested , ” added Paikin

Could the two men in the picture be cops dressed up as anarchists ?
It would n’t be the first time that cops had posed as protesters and deliberately staged violence in an effort to justify a heavy - handed police response .
We have documented numerous different occasions where the black bloc anarchists were completely infiltrated by the authorities to provide a pretext for a police state crackdown .
A recent example occurred at last year ’s Pittsburgh G20 summit , where footage showed three burly older men who look completely out of place with black bandanas over their face walking alongside young protesters during a march against police brutality in a You Tube clip entitled “ G20 Epic Undercover Police Fail ” .
The clip would be hilarious if it was not so disturbing .
Protesters walking behind what are obviously badly disguised cops claim they broke cameras and acted aggressively towards genuine protesters , as well as carrying gas canisters .
During a peaceful demonstration on the same night , riot cops savagely attacked protesters with batons and rubber bullets while also assaulting and arresting students who were n’t even part of the demonstration .
Following the SPP protests in Canada three years ago , Quebec provincial authorities were forced to admit that three rock - wielding black mask - wearing “ anarchists ” were in fact police infiltrators used to gather information on protesters .
Video shows two of the provocateurs pick up rocks and try to incite violence before they are outed as cops by legitimate demonstrators .
The two thugs then tried to slip behind police lines before their fellow officers were forced to stage their arrest .
Again , the fact that they were cops in disguise was later admitted by authorities .
Interestingly as it applies to the Toronto “ anarchists , ” one of the primary reasons the men initially aroused suspicion was the fact that they were wearing the same distinctive boots as the uniformed riot police .
Watch the video .
Alex Jones ’ film Police State 2 : The Takeover exposed how the black bloc anarchists were completely infiltrated and provocateured by the authorities during the violent 1999 WTO protests in Seattle .
The authorities declared a state of emergency , imposed curfews and resorted to nothing short of police state tactics in response to a small minority of hostile black bloc hooligans .
Police allowed the black bloc to run riot in downtown Seattle while they concentrated on preventing the movement of peaceful protestors .
The film presents clear evidence that the black bloc anarchist group was actually controlled by the state and used to demonize peaceful protesters .
Watch the video below .
At the WTO protests in Genoa 2001 a protestor was killed after being shot in the head and run over twice by a police vehicle .
The Italian Carabiniere also later beat on peaceful protestors as they slept , and even tortured some , at the Diaz School .
It later emerged that the police fabricated evidence against the protesters , claiming they were anarchist rioters , to justify their actions .
Some Carabiniere officials have since come forward to say they knew of infiltration of the so called black bloc anarchists , and that fellow officers acted as agent provocateurs .
At the Free Trade Area of Americas protests in Miami in late November 2003 , more provocateuring was evident .
The United Steelworkers of America calling for a congressional investigation , stated that the police intentionally caused violence and arrested and charged hundreds of peaceful protestors .
The USWA suggested that billions of dollars supposedly slated for Iraq reconstruction funds are actually being used to subsidize “ homeland repression ” in America .
The leadership of the black bloc has been completely usurped by the authorities and anyone who still professes to be a member of the group is either supremely naive or completely stupid .
To dress up like terrorists , all in black with ski masks and bandanas ( like the police ) immediately sends out a negative message to the watching public and demonizes legitimate protesters , as does pointlessly setting fire to a police car .
Engaging in such acts only bolsters the rational and reasonable facade of groups like G20 that the anarchists supposedly want to discredit .
Such incidents provide the perfect justification for the authorities to shut down the free speech of legitimate demonstrators who actually have something of substance to say and a means of communicating their message , people like Charlie Veitch , who was arrested , tortured and caged by Toronto police thugs after he used a bullhorn .

HIV research is undergoing a renaissance that could lead to new ways to develop vaccines against the AIDS virus and other viral diseases .
In the latest development , U.S. government scientists say they have discovered three powerful antibodies , the strongest of which neutralizes 91 % of HIV strains , more than any AIDS antibody yet discovered .
They are now deploying the technique used to find those antibodies to identify antibodies to influenza viruses .
The HIV antibodies were discovered in the cells of a 60 - year - old African - American gay man , known in the scientific literature as Donor 45 , whose body made the antibodies naturally .
The trick for scientists now is to develop a vaccine or other methods to make anyone 's body produce them as well .
That effort " will require work , " said Gary Nabel , director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , who was a leader of the research .
" We 're going to be at this for a while " before any benefit is seen in the clinic , he said .
The research was published Thursday in two papers in the online edition of the journal Science , 10 days before the opening of a large International AIDS Conference in Vienna , where prevention science is expected to take center stage .
More than 33 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2008 , and about 2.7 million contracted the virus that year , according to United Nations estimates .

Predictably , this week ’s release of thousands of classified documents by WikiLeaks — which also provided them to the New York Times , Germany ’s Der Spiegel and the Guardian in London — has fired up those who believe secrecy fosters national security and who shudder at the idea of journalists rummaging through classified material .
Typical was the comment from tiresome Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) .
WikiLeaks , he maintained , is armed with “ an ideological agenda implacably hostile to our military and the most basic requirements of our national security . ”
To which one is tempted to say : So what ?
What motivates WikiLeaks to post classified material is barely even interesting , much less important .
Rather , the germane question is whether the United States and its allies are best served by secrecy or debate .
And the answer is obvious :
No democracy can or should fight a war without the consent of its people , and that consent is only meaningful if it is predicated on real information .
That is not to say classified material should be published in haste or with indifference .
Thankfully , WikiLeaks and its media colleagues appear to have behaved thoughtfully in their handling of these documents .
The New York Times sought and received guidance from the Obama administration on especially sensitive materials , and even WikiLeaks redacted thousands of pages that included names of people whose safety might be jeopardized .
Those are the actions of responsible journalists .
The WikiLeaks materials have been likened to the Pentagon Papers , an exaggeration but not an entirely inapt comparison .
The new documents offer insight primarily into the war - fighting of the recently departed George W. Bush administration ; the Pentagon Papers ended with the Johnson administration and were not published until Richard Nixon was president .
But much of the WikiLeaks material emanates from the field , so although it makes for gripping reading , it lacks the deep policy implications of the Pentagon Papers .
In 1971 , the Supreme Court rebuffed Nixon ’s attempt to thwart publication of that historic report , and Justice Hugo Black concurred with an opinion that offers timely rebuttal to Lieberman and others who deplore the publication of these latest documents .
In crafting the 1st Amendment , Black wrote , the founders understood that security was not best protected by secrecy but by scrutiny .
“ The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people , ” Black wrote .
“ Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government .
And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell . ”
I 'm a fan of this strangely megalithic museum and cultural center made from a series of concrete shells , colored white with crushed marble , proposed for the Czech city of Olomouc .
According to the designers , Šépka Architekti , the project " attempts to draw inspiration from both ... a small scale of mediaeval subdivision of land on the one hand and the large scale of palaces , ecclesiastical and military buildings of the Předhradí beginning here on the other .
"
The museum is divided into five apparently separate but linked buildings ; this is due to " the necessary separation of the individual functions of the exhibition halls , library , entry hall or bookshop and refreshments , " a " necessary separation " that also generates a convenient spatial identity for the overall project .
One of the coolest things about the design , though , is what Šépka Architekti call their " house in a house " idea , inspired by access to indirect sunlight : " Even in the cases when an upper floor is inserted in an individual building , daylight is ensured on the lower floor through placement of a smaller structure .
We thus approach the topic of a ‘ house in a house ’ , which ensures favourable conditions for the the display of exhibits on the walls while providing light from above on both floors .
"
You can see the formal implications of this in the below image , where a massive , seemingly hovering trapezoid acts both as another , elevated room for gallery use and as a massive , light - filtering device for the skylights further above .
It 's a mass that casts shadows inside the building .
Provided the exterior concrete ages well , the museum 's fivefold street presence — briefly stepping back at one point to form a public plaza — is actually pretty stunning .
It manages to allude to design languages as diverse as Neo-Brutalism , the Romanesque , a kind of Tatooine Moderne , and computer harddrive casings ( although I 'm reminded of Owen Hatherley 's recent quip about " a modernised classicism , monumental yet free in details , that usually gets subsumed under the meaningless retrospective coinage ' art deco ' " — here , we might say , " modern geometries , imposing in size , built from concrete , and thus subsumed under the meaningless retrospective coinage ' Neo - Brutalism ' " ) .
The results are quite beautiful in profile , even when simply rising up behind the walls of neighboring buildings .
In any case , the interior volumes also lend themselves well to defining an overall spatial experience , even while departing from one another just enough to keep each bay or gallery distinct .
As mentioned earlier , that interior is a mix of art galleries , a library , a bookshop / cafe , performance spaces , and , oddly enough , as if Photoshopped in simply to prove a point , a basketball court .
Note that the stadium seating visible in many of these images has been mounted on rails for ease of rearrangement .
In plan , it 's interesting to remember that the separate units of the building here were generated from what Šépka Architekti referred to as the " small scale of mediaeval subdivision of land . "
In other words , the buildings take their formal cue — at least abstractly — from ancient real estate divisions on the ground in Olomouc , not from some overzealous application of the architects ' own stylized form of site analysis .
The complete building , seen in slices : Further , the " small scale of mediaeval subdivision of land " that I 've mentioned three times now also means that what could very easily be an imposing , alien monolith made from smooth white concrete , stuck irresponsibly in the center of the city , actually manages to be appropriate in scale .
The building has n't been constructed , of course , and we have no real idea how the concrete will age ; but I was struck by the images from the instant I saw them , flipping through a back issue of a 10 yesterday afternoon .

It 's another chapter in the now familiar story of China 's economic embrace of Africa .
Except that this one begins nearly 600 years ago .
A team of 11 Chinese archaeologists will arrive in Kenya tomorrow to begin the search for an ancient shipwreck and other evidence of commerce with China dating back to the early 15th century .
The three - year , £ 2 m joint project will centre around the tourist towns of Lamu and Malindi and should shed light on a largely unknown part of both countries ' histories .
The sunken ship is believed to have been part of a mighty armada commanded by Ming dynasty admiral Zheng He , who reached Malindi in 1418 .
According to Kenyan lore , reportedly backed by recent DNA testing , a handful of survivors swum ashore .
After killing a python that had been plaguing a village , they were allowed to stay and marry local women , creating a community of African - Chinese whose descendants still live in the area .
A likely shipwreck site has been identified near Lamu island , according to Idle Farah , director general of the National Museums of Kenya , which is working on the archaeology project with its Chinese equivalent and Peking University .
" The voyages of the Portuguese and the Arabs to our coasts have long been documented , " Farah told the Guardian .
" Now , by examining this shipwreck , we hope to clarify with clear evidence the first contact between China and east Africa . "
The project forms part of a recent effort by the Chinese government to celebrate the achievements of Zheng , a Muslim whose ships sailed the Indian and Pacific Oceans many decades before the exploits of more celebrated European explorers such as Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama .
Starting in 1405 , Zheng made seven journeys , taking in south - east Asia , India , the Middle East and Africa , in fleets of up to 300 huge ships with nearly 30,000 sailors in total , according to Chinese records .
On his voyages , Zheng dished out gifts from the Chinese emperor , including gold , porcelain and silk .
In return , he brought home ivory , myrrh , zebras and camels .
But it was a giraffe that caused the biggest stir .
The animal is known to have been a gift from the Sultan of Malindi , on Kenya 's northern coast , but theories vary as to how exactly it got to China .
One account suggests that the giraffe was taken from the ruler of Bengal — who himself had received it as a gift from the Sultan — and that it inspired Zheng to visit Kenya a few years later .
Herman Kiriama , Kenya 's head of coastal archeology , said the joint archeological team will this week try to locate the Sultan 's original village , which is though to be around Mambrui village , outside Malindi , where Ming porcelain has been discovered .
In late August , the project will move underwater , with the arrival of specialist maritime archeologists from China .
" Though we have not located the shipwreck yet , we have good indications of where it might have gone down , " said Kiriama .
The team 's confidence in finding the sunken ship is bolstered by work done in the run-up to the 600th anniversary of Zheng 's first voyage .
As part of the 2005 celebration , in which the Beijing government sought to present Zheng as a sort of maritime goodwill ambassador – a portrayal disputed by some scholars who point to his use of military force – China sent a team of scholars to Lamu .
In Siyu village they conducted DNA tests on a Swahili family whose oral history and hints of Chinese facial features led them to believe they were descendants of Zheng 's shipwrecked sailors .
The tests reportedly showed evidence of Chinese ancestry and a 19 - year - old woman called Mwamaka Shirafu was given a full scholarship to study traditional medicine in China , where she remains .
Israel has rejected calls for an independent international investigation of its raids on the Gaza - bound aid flotilla on Monday that killed nine activists .
The raids have sparked international condemnation , with South Africa becoming the latest nation to withdraw its ambassador from Israel in protest .
Israel has defended the actions of its soldiers from the outset , saying the deaths of the activists onboard the humanitarian ships in international waters was an act of self - defence by its commandos .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev says his country holds itself to the highest international standards .
He says Israel 's military will conduct the investigation into what happened .
" It is our standard practice that after all military operations - and especially operations where there have been fatalities - that we conduct a thorough , professional , independent investigation , " he said .
But whether that is enough to satisfy the United States is not clear .
The US had called for a " prompt , impartial , credible and transparent " investigation by Israel .
Yesterday US vice president Joe Biden suggested an Israeli probe with international involvement .
That was initially embraced by Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman , who said : " We have enough high - level legal experts - if they want to take on observers from the outside , they can invite observers . "
Today , US president Barack Obama said he expected Israel to agree to an impartial investigation because they " recognise that this can't be good for Israel 's long - term security " .
But some EU countries are still demanding an international investigation and the Geneva - based UN Human Rights Council has decided to dispatch its own fact - finding mission .
That decision has been attacked by Israel 's foreign ministry , which says the council has no moral authority and also said it was " working stubbornly against Israel " .
All of this is against the backdrop of more ships determined the break the blockade .
The MV Rachel Corrie is motoring towards Gaza , carrying activists from Ireland and Malaysia .
Among them is former United Nations humanitarian coordinator Dennis Halliday .
" This is a time for Israel to change its policy and to allow at least this small cargo boat into Gaza , " he said .
" We are optimistic but we are also sanguine that this may not happen , that we will be boarded possibly by the Israelis .
" I suppose we have to anticipate they will do that in international waters , which again , would be a violation of international law . "
That ship is expected to be intercepted but pressure is mounting on Israel to find a compromise on its blockade .
The Reuters newsagency says a plan under which the UN could search goods bound for Gaza during transit in Israel 's Ashdod port was going to be discussed by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his inner cabinet .
An international naval force is also being suggested .
An Israeli TV channel has reported the establishment of such a force to inspect ships bound for Gaza was discussed by Mr Netanyahu and former British prime minister Tony Blair .
Mr Blair is now the European Union 's Middle East envoy .
When speaking to reporters , he only discussed the situation in Gaza .
" I have been there calling for a change in policy on Gaza to open crossings for goods that should come into Gaza to help the people there for the best part of two years , " he said .
" I do n't think it is simply as a result of this incident .
I just think the policy in Gaza is counterproductive and what we should be doing is allowing material in , that we build homes and sanitation and power and water systems . "
The plight of Gaza 's citizens has also been raised by Mr Obama .
While he acknowledged Israel 's legitimate security concerns about Hamas , he said the blockade was preventing people from " pursuing economic opportunities " .
Mr Obama says he hopes this week 's tragic events could be used as an opportunity to advance the peace process .
He is due to meet Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas at the White House on Wednesday .
Yes , believe it or not , it can be done without a GameShark or other cheating device .
Here 's what you 'll need to do :
Restart your game and play until you get HM02 Fly from the house west of Celadon City .
DO NOT fight the following trainers :
The Youngster with a Slowpoke ( Level 17 ) on the road to Bill 's house ( Route 25 ) .
He is the fourth trainer after you cross Nugget Bridge , standing directly above a female trainer and facing north .
The Gambler with two Poliwags and a Poliwhirl ( all Level 22 ) between Lavender Town and Saffron City ( Route 8 ) .
He is standing just east of the entrance to Saffron City , facing north toward the door of the Underground Path .
Carefully follow the series of steps illustrated below .
Make sure you have a Pokémon that knows Fly .
On Route 8 , stand in front of the door of the Underground Path .
Save your game , since saving after this point will disrupt the procedure .
Walk down one step and immediately press Start .
If you succeed , the menu will pop up before the Gambler " sees " you .
Go to the Pokémon list and fly to Cerulean City .
The Gambler will see you just before you fly away .
Your Start button will no longer function .
Go north across Nugget Bridge and head east until you find the trainer in this picture ( he 's the Youngster described above ) .
If you walk right up to the Youngster , the game will lock up , so you 'll have to let him see you and walk up to you .
Defeat his Slowpoke ( afterwards , your Start button will work again ) , then fly to Lavender Town .
Head west into Route 8 .
As soon as you enter the narrow path , the menu will pop up by itself .
Press B to exit ... ... and look who it is !
Mew will be at Level 7 and its only attack will be Pound .
Pokéball , go !
Once you 've caught Mew , you can save your game without any ill - effects .
There are two alternative ways to enter Route 8 and trigger Mew after beating the Youngster .
If you have access to Saffron City , you can fly there and go through the eastern city gate .
Also , you can fly to Celadon City , head east to Route 7 , enter the Underground Path , and emerge back in front of the Gambler .
Finally , the Route 8 Gambler is n't the only trainer that can initiate the trick .
The Super Nerd just west of him can also do it , as can the second Fisherman you meet when heading south from Lavender on Route 12 .
There are numerous others ; basically , any trainer who is scrolled onto the screen by the same step that puts you in their vision range will work .
However , remember that the final battle with Mew will only be triggered by returning to whatever route that trainer is in , which is not necessarily Route 8 .
Thanks to TheScythe from the GameFAQs message boards for the information on how to do this .
You can also get detailed information on how this trick works , as well as how it can be used to catch any Pokémon in the game .
Discuss this trick on the Message Bored .

What would retirement without savings look like ?
That 's not as crazy a question as it may sound .
By many estimates , you are going to need at least 70 % of your income in retirement .
Unfortunately , in our society of instant gratification , where keeping up with the Joneses is more important than saving money for the future , having a nest egg at all is considered a big achievement .
A 2019 research study from Northwestern Mutual found that 22 % of adults in the U.S. have less than $ 5,000 saved for retirement and 46 % expect to work past the age of 65 .﻿﻿
In this debt - driven society , the thought of retiring penniless may not keep you up at night , but having your money run out once you do stop working should .
Let 's look at what life could be like with nothing much in the bank when you hit your late 60s and beyond .
Fast Fact
In 2020 , the average monthly Social Security benefit was only $ 1,509 .
Social Security Could Be Your Main Income
Retirement means the end of a steady income , which is why having a nest egg is so important .
Let ’s say your annual income was $ 100,000 when you were working .
That means you ’ll need around $ 70,000 per year in order to maintain your lifestyle when you 're out of the workforce .
Without savings , either you would need to earn that money or cut way back if you plan to rely on Social Security .
For many people who enter retirement without any saved cash , their only source of income ends up being Social Security .
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , " For about half of seniors , [ Social Security ] provides at least 50 percent of their income , and for about 1 in 5 seniors , it provides at least 90 percent of income , across multiple surveys . " ﻿﻿
With the average monthly Social Security check at $ 1,509 as on March 2020 , it can be a big shock for seniors who were used to bringing in much more .﻿﻿
Getting by is going to be a stretch when Social Security is your only source of income .
Although there are ways to maximize it , Social Security still functions best as an adjunct to personal savings .
Throw healthcare costs , a mortgage , personal debt , and other expenses into the mix , and you will see that Social Security is n’t going to be enough .
Key Takeaways
With your retirement possibly lasting 20 years or longer , saving for it is more vital than ever .
Lack of retirement savings can require you to downsize your lifestyle , even your living quarters .
Many seniors without adequate retirement funds would need to take a part - time job .
Continuing to work during retirement can take a toll on your health .
You May Need to Downsize Your Lifestyle
Even if you were doing well in your working years , if you did not stow away enough money , you could need to adjust your lifestyle downward in retirement .
That could mean possibly moving into a smaller home or apartment ; forgoing extras such as cable television , an iPhone , or a gym membership ; swapping your current car — after you drive it into the ground — for a less costly one ; or , if you live in a large metropolitan area , you might have the option of doing without a car entirely .
Not having enough money could even mean moving in with your adult children , which is the case for many seniors .
After all , even if you make a nice profit on the sale of your house , your retirement easily could last for more than 20 years , and there 's also the possibility that you could outlive the proceeds of your home sale , along with those of any other assets that you sell .
Taking on a Roommate Might Be Necessary
Often , seniors who have not saved extra for retirement , and who still own homes , turn to their homes as a source of income .
For some , this could mean renting a portion of their space as a separate apartment , and for others , it could result in taking on a roommate , both of which can be fraught with risks .
Being a landlord is fine if you do n’t mind sharing space , but if you are the type of retiree who values peace and quiet and does n’t like to share , then renting a room could be a bitter pill to swallow .
For other retirees who still have their homes , it could mean taking a reverse mortgage , which is not everyone 's cup of tea and can be costly and risky .
Working Part - Time Might Be a Necessity
To maintain yourself in retirement you might need an extra income stream .
Often , this means that either you would go back to work or get a part - time job .
Although that 's not bad in and of itself , when you need money , you ca n’t be choosy about what job you accept .
Needing to work at something that you feel is " beneath " you can be rough on the psyche .
The surge in the global workforce thanks to the internet makes it easier for seniors to work remotely .
Retailers are also more than willing to hire retirees because they tend to be reliable and loyal .
However , if your health fails and a part - time job is not doable , then without savings , you could be facing real financial hardship .
Retirement Might Not Even
Be on the Table
If you have not saved money for retirement and are not willing to make sacrifices and overhaul your lifestyle , then retirement might not be an option for you at all , particularly if Social Security is n’t enough to live on .
Many people forego retirement and work for as long as possible , largely because they do n’t have enough saved .
Unfortunately , even if you love your work , working longer could take a toll on your physical and emotional health , so it 's not ideal .
Workers of all ages have long heard about the need to save for retirement and the importance of saving enough .
Still , far too often people who otherwise could afford to save shrug off the advice , putting not even a penny into a retirement savings account .
Without the money saved for a retirement that could last for 20 or more years , retirees could be forced to downsize their home and lifestyle , take on a roommate , get a part - time job , or even forgo retirement altogether .

Henry , understand , I as a father of three with a wife came to the conclusion that if we were living in the gulf region that we would be packing our things right now and leaving .
With that decision it seemed imperative that I at least let other people , who might be in this region or know of somebody in this region , know of what I believe are significant risks at this particular juncture of this attempted pressure containment .
I think this youtube video describes the situation most accurately :
BP engineers were hoping to achieve gas pressures as high as 10,000 psi , and they were hoping for a sustained pressure of around 8,000 psi .
The fact that they only got upwards of 6,700 psi indicates that they have leaks , which is not good news as you know this means that oil is working its way between the steel case and the sedimentary layers .
A major point to keep in mind is the huge percentage of methane gas : I have read upwards of 30 % of the discharge is methane gas .
This gas will gradually seep between various levels of strata leading to a rise in the sea floor .
Here is part of a July 16th article from the LA Times Greenspace :
" We 're at the point where there 's enough uncertainty ... we need to be careful not to do any harm , " said Thad Allen , the retired Coast Guard admiral who is overseeing the spill response .
After consulting with scientists Friday afternoon , Allen told BP to take more seismic soundings of the seabed and expand its monitoring of the seafloor .
A federal ship with the ability to detect methane bubbles in the water - signaling a leak - was also called into action .
end times article
I think it is noteworthy that they are requesting a ship to look for gas bubbles ; it must be a large area that they need to monitor .

London , England ( CNN ) --
An amateur treasure hunter armed with a metal detector has found over 52,000 Roman coins worth $ 1 million buried in field , one of the largest ever such finds in the UK , said the British Museum .
Dave Crisp , a hospital chef , came across the buried treasure while searching for " metal objects " in a field near Frome , Somerset in southwestern England .
Initially , Crisp found 21 coins , but when he unearthed the pot , he knew he needed archaeological help to excavate them .
The hoard contains 766 coins bearing an image of the Roman general Marcus Aurelius Carausius , who ruled Britain independently from AD 286 to AD 293 and was the first Roman emperor to strike coins in Britain .
Somerset County Council archaeologists excavated the pot -- a type of container normally used for storing food -- it weighed 160kg ( 350 pounds ) and contained 52,500 coins .
The hoard was transferred to the British Museum in London where the coins were cleaned and recorded .
The coins date from AD 253 to 293 and most of them are made of debased silver or bronze .
Roger Bland , Head of Portable Antiquities and Treasure at the British Museum , told CNN : " Dave [ Crisp ] did the right thing , he did n't try to dig it all out .
This is the largest ever find in a single pot and the second largest ever [ in the UK ] .
" We think that whoever buried it did n't intend to come back to recover it .
We can only guess why people buried treasure , some buried savings , others because they feared an invasion , perhaps this was an offering to the Gods . "
Bland said the coins were probably worth about $ 1 million .
Dave Crisp , from Devizes in Wiltshire , told CNN : " At the time when I actually found the pot I did n't know what size it was but when the archaeologists came and started to uncover it , I was gobsmacked , I thought ' hell , this is massive . ' "
Crisp , who describes himself as a " metal detectorist , " unearthed the pot in April , although the discovery was officially announced on Thursday .
Crisp told CNN he would have to split the value of the find with the farmer who owns the field in which he discovered the treasure .
Somerset Coroner Tony Williams is scheduled to hold an inquest on July 22 to formally determine whether the find is subject to the Treasure Act 1996 .
This would help towards determining a value of the hoard should any individual or organization want to buy it .
Opinion polls expect almost 40 seats out of 150 in the Dutch lower house of parliament to go to the Party for Freedom and Democracy ( VVD ) , which proposes severe public spending cuts in the first elections in a eurozone country since the Greek crisis struck .
Sony Online Entertainment has released a short video showing off super - speed in the upcoming DC Universe Online massively - multiplayer online game .
Creative Director Jens Andersen introduces the clips , which feature both the Flash and player - created characters .
The video highlights not just running fast , but running up buildings , running upside - down on the ceiling , and special combat moves like whirlwinds .
If it does n’t work here , or you want to watch it at a different size , you can watch it at YouTube .
( Found via ComicBook Movie , though I could n’t get the video to play there . )
Judging by the comments on yesterday ’s Flash # 3 variant cover , I should probably mention that this game has been in the works for quite a while .
I would n’t be surprised if the Flash shown above was designed at a time when Wally West was still the main version of the character .

Ottawa — Entre Dieu et Darwin , les Canadiens choisissent le scientifique lorsque vient le temps d'expliquer l'origine de la vie .
Leurs voisins du Sud , eux , préfèrent la théorie de La Genèse .
C'est ce qui ressort d'un vaste sondage effectué par la maison Angus Reid au Canada , aux États - Unis et en Grande - Bretagne .
Les répondants étaient invités à dire s'ils pensaient que l'humain était le résultat de l'évolution , au cours de millions d'années , de formes de vie moins avancées , ou si au contraire il était une créature de Dieu apparue dans sa forme actuelle au cours des 10 000 dernières années .
Ainsi , 61 % des Canadiens et 68 % des Britanniques ont penché pour l'évolution , contre 35 % chez les Américains .
Aux États - Unis , 47 % des Américains ont choisi la version divine .
Au Canada , une personne sur quatre ( 24 % ) a quand même dit croire au créationnisme .
Le reste des répondants ( 15 % ) a dit ne pas savoir .
Par rapport à 2007 , quand Angus Reid avait mené le même sondage , c'est une légère augmentation dans les deux camps : il y avait alors 58 % de pro-Darwin , contre 22 % de créationnistes .
C'est au Québec que la théorie de Darwin sur l'évolution des espèces est la plus populaire ( 66 % ) .
Dans la province , seulement 17 % des gens ont dit croire à l'histoire de la Bible , soit le plus bas taux , et de loin , de tout le pays .
Paradoxalement , c'est en terre pétrolifère , là où la décomposition de matières végétales et de carcasses de dinosaures vieilles de millions d'années fait pleuvoir la richesse , que la croyance dans le créationnisme est la plus forte .
En Alberta , en Saskatchewan et au Manitoba , entre 50 et 51 % des gens ont dit adhérer à la thèse scientifique de l'origine de la vie .
Ils sont 31 % en Alberta et 39 % en Saskatchewan et au Manitoba à croire à la création .
L'année dernière , à l'occasion du 200e anniversaire de naissance du naturaliste Charles Darwin , Le Devoir avait effectué un vox -pop non scientifique auprès des députés et ministres fédéraux à Ottawa .
Cela avait permis de constater à quel point sa théorie scientifique , voulant que les humains et les singes aient en partage des ancêtres , n'est pas acceptée par tous .
Le président du Conseil du Trésor , Stockwell Day , est un ardent créationniste , prônant l'enseignement de ce concept religieux à l'école , tout comme l'est le ministre d'État aux Sciences et à la Technologie , Gary Goodyear .
Les ministres Jim Flaherty ( Finances ) , Rob Nicholson ( Justice ) , Jason Kenney ( Citoyenneté et Immigration ) et Chuck Strahl ( Affaires indiennes ) estiment qu'il est possible de croire à la fois à la création et l'évolution .
Dans le camp de Darwin , on retrouve Jim Prentice ( Environnement ) , James Moore ( Patrimoine ) , Bev Oda ( Coopération internationale ) , Jean - Pierre Blackburn ( Anciens Combattants ) et Gordon O'Connor ( whip ) .
Plusieurs avaient souhaité un « joyeux anniversaire » ironique au fêté ( Vic Toews , Sécurité publique ) .
Gilles Duceppe , Michael Ignatieff et Thomas Mulcair s'étaient prononcés pour l'évolution .
Aux États - Unis , seulement 35 % de la population a dit privilégier la théorie de l'évolution , contre 47 % qui adhèrent au créationnisme .
Dans aucune région la théorie de l'évolution n'est endossée par une majorité de gens .
Il n'y a que dans le nord - est américain que plus de gens adhèrent à la théorie de l'évolution ( 43 % ) qu'au créationnisme ( 38 % ) .
La Grande - Bretagne se pose en championne de l'évolution .
Seulement 16 % ont dit croire au créationnisme .
Fait à noter , c'est dans la capitale , Londres , que le taux d'adhésion à l'évolution est le plus bas ( 58 % ) et au créationnisme , le plus élevé ( 25 % ) .
Le sondage a été effectué en ligne en juillet 2009 .
Au Canada , 1009 personnes ont été interrogées et aux États - Unis , 1002 .
La marge d'erreur est de 3,1 % , 19 fois sur 20 .
En Grande - Bretagne , 2011 personnes ont été questionnées , pour une marge d'erreur de 2,2 % , 19 fois sur 20 .
Les marges d'erreur sont plus importantes pour les résultats régionaux .

“ I am pleased that we are remembering him now , even if it is nine decades after his rather lonely death , far from the desert where his reputation should have been made , as it was with Lawrence , who had learned so much from him , ” he said .
Fortune 's Apple 2.0 is reporting that the latest email exchange between Steve Jobs and a customer was entirely fake , according to statements made by Apple PR .
The conversation was published Thursday by The Boy Genius Report and linked to by more than three dozen other sites .
In it , a writer pretending to be Apple 's CEO tries several times to mollify a customer called " Tom " who is furious about the iPhone 4's widely reported signal attenuation problem .
In separate e-mail messages Jobs purportedly tells " Tom , " who grows angrier with each exchange .
Boy Genius Report had originally published and vouched for the emails claiming the exchange was legitimate .
Apple PR says the entire conversation was fabricated .
The statements originally attributed to Steve Jobs included :
" No , you are getting all worked up over a few days of rumors .
Calm down . "
" You are most likely in an area with very low signal strength . "
" You may be working from bad data .
Not your fault .
Stay tuned .
We are working on it . "
" Retire , relax , enjoy your family .
It is just a phone .
Not worth it . "
Note that even before Apple PR 's response , BGR had already retracted the last statement that they had originally attributed to Steve Jobs .
The " Retire , relax , enjoy your family .
It is just a phone .
Not worth it . " statement was later attributed to the customer , not Steve Jobs .
Though , now it appears the entire exchange was fabricated .
Adding further doubt to the motivation behind the original email poster , AppleInsider reports that the emailer had shopped the story around to several sites .
It 's not clear if BGR paid for the the rights to publish the story .

For years , Republicans have been selling themselves as the party of business , using Small Business as the banner from which to launch their tax cuts for huge corporations .
In Joe the Plumber , they epitomized this tactic ; Using the sometimes less than accurate “ Joe the Plumber ” — who was n’t a licensed plumber and did n’t , in fact , pay all of those taxes he moaned about on TV — to prop up the agenda for Big Business .
And for years , the American public has bought the costly mistaken guise of the Republican Party as being good for small business .
In fact , many moderate Main Streeters were only nudged into Obama territory over Palin outrage , but their hard - working fiscal hearts remained with the Republican Party .
Yes , the Republican Party , the party of hard work , fiscal accountability , balanced budgets , personal responsibility and meritocracy .
Only that party is no longer recognizable .
While the actions of the Republican Party are those of a Party whose ideology has been bastardized beyond recognition until it is being used to justify some sort of social Darwinistic “ Christian ” jihad on humanity justified by the “ Jesus - blessed ” “ free market ” “ winners ” , this reality has been slow to dim on the heartland .
We were , after all , used to believing what they tell us they stand for .
We might not have agreed , but we took them at their word regarding their ideology .
Advertisements
We can no longer afford to take Republicans at their word .
Yesterday , President Obama urged Senate Republicans to stand by their own ideology by backing a bill designed to cut taxes for small businesses .
The President spoke at a New Jersey sandwich shop , and called this bill “ as American as apple pie ” .
Obama also noted its provisions were “ things the Republican Party has said it supported for years , ” and today Senate Republicans responded by blocking the small business jobs bill 58 - 42 .
As Sen. Patty Murray said on the Senate floor , according to Bloomberg , “ Once again a common - sense bill that would help Americans is being held hostage by political calculation . ”
On paper , it seemed a non-issue .
CNN reported :
“ The small - business bill before the Senate would set up a $ 30 billion lending fund to help community banks offer small businesses credit .
It also would provide tax breaks to small businesses that invest in new equipment and hire unemployed workers .
The House passed a similar bill in June . ”
Lower taxes for small business ?
Is n’t that what the Republicans are always nattering on about ?
Do n’t they say that creates jobs ?
And is n’t this bill designed to give tax cuts precisely for hiring new workers and buying equipment ?
And are n’t economists all in agreement about the necessity to get money moving in this economy , something a small business loan does quite effectively ?
Hmmm .
What ’s the problem ?
Well , this bill would also eliminate capital gains taxes for key investments and allow small businesses to write off appreciation on new equipment .
Um , yeah .
I dunno know about you , but when I hear “ eliminate capital gains taxes ” , I think “ capitalism ” , “ free market ” and maybe on a bad day of too much Right Wing Radio , “ liberty ” .
But I sure as heck do n’t think that Republicans will be voting NO on eliminating capital gains taxes .
Unless , of course , said bill would actually help our economy … … seeing as a boost in our economy would not help the Republicans this fall .
Yes , in that case , I can sure imagine the Republicans voting no on their own ideas .
And of course , they ’ll need to take cover for their desperate politics .
Cut to : Republicans claim to be worried about the “ Cost ” of the measure .
Yes , that ’s right ladies and gentlemen .
The Republican Party has found their Fiscal Political Savior and her name is “ Cost ” .
You heard a lot about “ Cost ” during the healthcare debates , during the unemployment extension debates , and now you ’re hearing it as an excuse to not cut taxes for small businesses .
Cost .
Cost , as in , the cost of the Iraq War .
Cost , as in the Bush unpaid for tax cuts .
Cost , as in the Medicare prescription drug bill .
Cost .
So , suddenly the Republicans do n’t want to give small businesses a tax break because of “ Cost ” .
And yet , they are still campaigning on cutting taxes for small businesses .
Yes , in fact , I ’m watching one of their ads right now on my TV .
It ’s really tough to vote against your own platform and claim you stand for anything .
Tough , if not impossible , in fact .
Maybe someone should tell the Republicans that even when they leave something off of the budget all together , it still has to be paid for .
I mean , heck , that ’s how it runs in my small business .
Maybe it ’s different when you ’re running the country , eh? Maybe “ cost ” does n’t matter when you ’re in charge .
Maybe it only matters when you ’ve been trounced / whooped / clobbered in an election and the guy who won just keeps on passing liberal legislation that will change the role government will play in American lives for a very long time .
Yeah .
That has to hurt .
And they have nothing to run on .
Their ideology failed when implemented and their politicians turned out to be the opposite of everything the party claims to stand for .
All they can do at this point is hope that America , still struggling to overcome their last dangerously drunken turn at the wheel , will fail .
And that Americans are too stupid to remember who caused this problem .
So , when Obama wants to give a tax cut to the small business owners , the Republicans call that a “ hand out ” but when they give tax cuts to big business , they call it “ stimulating job growth ” ( and hush , not a word about those jobs they “ incentivized ” right out of the country ) .
And still , when they campaign , they wave their American flags and stand next to Joe the Plumber , touting themselves as the Only Choice for Small Business owners .
I do n’t know about you , but where I come from , we call that talkin’ outta both sides of your mouth .
Now that Senate Republicans have voted ‘ No ’ on tax cuts for small businesses , they have definitively jumped their ideological shark .
Show - Me - The -Money
Joe the Plumber turned out to be the perfect poster child for the modern day Republican Party :
One embarrassing fib after another , piled onto a dung heap of hypocrisy and sketchy ethics , all topped off with a healthy dose of misinformation and not a drop of shame after being exposed .
There is nothing more lame than following your parents on social media .
At least , that is what many people think .
( mainly teenagers and full on hipsters ) .
Sure , when you are at an impressionable age , most things to do with parents are perceived as lame and uncool .
But there are also many people who have embraced social media or online communications , as a way to reconnect with their parents and other family members .
Now you can reach out and share all things good and bad , faster and with more details than you could via the phone or letters .
Twitter , Skype , Facebook and emails have replaced the regular call home to mum , or a letter packed with photos of the kids .
Holiday photos are shared almost immediately via Flickr or Picasa .
Family gatherings are organised through Facebook events , Google calendars or email .
Overseas calls can be accompanied with vision , via webcams and Skype .
Technology is giving us ways to share and bring our families together , even as it simultaneously provides avenues to tear things apart .
Now , if I could just create an app to allow Mum to remotely do my washing .
( What ?
That is not callous .
She misses doing it .
I just know she does …. )
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - The Vatican on Friday denied accusations that it viewed the ordination of women as priests and the sexual abuse of minors by clerics as equally criminal .
On Thursday , the Vatican issued a document making sweeping revisions to its laws on sexual abuse , extending the period in which charges can be filed against priests in church courts and broadening the use of fast - track procedures to defrock them .
But while it dealt mostly with pedophilia , it also codified the “ attempted ordination of a woman ” to the priesthood as one of the most serious crimes against Church law .
The inclusion of both issues in the same document caused a stir among some groups around the world , particularly those favoring a female priesthood .
“ The Vatican ’s decision to list women ’s ordination in the same category as pedophiles and rapists is appalling ... , ” Erin Saiz Hanna , executive director of the Women ’s Ordination Conference said .
She called the decision “ mediaeval at best ” .
But Monsignor Charles Scicluna , an official in the Vatican ’s doctrinal department , said there was no attempt to make women ’s ordination and pedophilia comparable crimes under canon ( Church ) law .
“ This is not putting everything into one basket , ” Scicluna , the Vatican ’s internal prosecutor for handling sexual abuse cases , told Reuters in a telephone interview .
“ They are in the same document but this does not put them on the same level or assign them the same gravity , ” said Scicluna , who helped formulate the revisions .
The document was an attempt to update norms concerning “ three sets of canonical crimes that are distinct , ” and whose jurisdiction is reserved to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , the Vatican ’s doctrinal department , he said .

CRIME AGAINST MORALITY
While sexual abuse was a “ crime against morality , ” the attempt to ordain a woman was a “ crime against a sacrament , ” he said , referring to Holy Orders ( the priesthood ) .
The revisions also updated crimes against the faith such as heresy .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
“ This should not be interpreted as considering all these crimes to be equal , ” he said .
“ They are crimes of a different nature ” .
The Catholic Church teaches that it cannot ordain women as priests because Christ chose only men as his apostles .
Proponents of a female priesthood reject this , saying he was only acting according to the norms of his times .
Some dissenters saw the placing of the two in one document as an attempt by the Vatican to respond to criticism by those who say the cause of at least some sexual abuse can be found in the Church ’s insistence on a male , celibate priesthood .
“ Sexuality is so denied in our Church , ” said Christian Weisner , a spokesman for the “ We Are Church ” liberal Catholic reform movement .
“ The Roman Catholic Church has to revise its sexual teachings because I think that this is the root of pedophile crime , ” Weisner told Reuters .
Jon O’Brien , president of the U.S. - based group Catholics for Choice , said the Vatican “ feels threatened ” by a growing movement in the Church that is in favor of a female priesthood .
O’Brien , whose group favors a female priesthood , said that while he understood the technical distinction of different types of Church crimes , putting the two together was another example of what he called bungled communications .
“ If there is an opportunity for authorities in the Vatican to shoot themselves in the foot , they do so in both feet , ” O ’Brien told Reuters .

• Categorized under Health , Objects | Difference Between Diet Coke and Coke Zero
Both ‘ Diet Cokes ’ and ‘ Coke Zero ’ are low calorie soft drinks compared to regular coke .
Both have similar ingredients which are carbonated purified water , flavour , artificial sweeteners aspartame , acesulphame potassium , preservative and caffeine .
Diet Coke came on market in 1982 ; preferred by many in America and became the number one sugar - free drink .
Diet Coke is also known as ‘ Coca - Cola light ’ in some countries and it is the No. 3 soft drink in the world .
It is preferred by people who want no calories , but plenty of taste .
Diet coke comes in many different flavours such as Black Cherry Cola Vanilla , Cola , Cola Green Tea , Cola Lemon , Cola Lemon Lime , Cola Lime , Cola Orange and Cola Raspberry .
But Coke Zero only offers ’ Coca - Cola ’ taste with zero calories .
It is preferred mostly by young adults and it is sweetened with a blend of aspartame and acesulfame potassium ( Ace K ) .
So overall the only key difference between the two drinks is in the proportions of the ingredients , which actually give different flavour profile .
Coke Zero has 0.5 kilocalories per 100 ml while Diet Coke contains 1 calorie .
It ’s been believed that men are more reluctant to buy diet coke because the word ‘ diet ’ associated with women .
Therefore , to market the product ‘ Coke Zero ’ been produced to associate masculinity .

Over the past few weeks , an interesting “ struggle ” has been growing between Austinites on the issue of whether the Best Wurst sausage cart should have its sidewalk permit renewed to vend in front of Parkside Restauarant .
The scene is the southeast corner of East 6th Street at San Jacinto , the heart of the East 6th Historic & Entertainment District .
Best Wurst has been selling yummy treats from its cart there for 17 years and has grown quite a popular customer following .
The owner , Jon Notarthomas , is a hard - working Austin musician and entrepreneur .
He pays $ 450 per year for the vending permit and transacts tens of thousands of dollars in business from his cart .
Parkside is a lovely fine - cuisine restaurant that opened in the circa - 1920 building where Dan McKlusky ’s steakhouse previously existed .
Shawn Cirkiel , the chef , and his Austin family purchased their building , valued by TCAD at $ 1.6 million , and completely renovated the property when opening the restaurant a couple of years ago .
Sidewalk vending permits must be renewed every 3 years and it is now that time for Best Wurst .
Parkside is opposing the renewal .
There are many reasons involved but the basic one is simply “ incompatibility ” .
This restuarant is not happy with having another food vendor directly outside of its front door .
City officials are caught in the middle .
There are many opposing perspectives arising through discussions of this matter :
“ Old / Iconic Austin ” versus “ New / Emerging Austin ” .
Upscale dining versus inexpensive street food .
Property owner rights versus temporary permitted uses .
Large investments and big taxes on property + liquor + sales versus modest investments , small fees and sales tax only .
The sensibilities of Austin ’s sidewalk vending permit process versus national best - practices for kiosk - style vending in public common areas .
The growing desire for East 6th to revitalize itself to make better 24/7 use of its century - old historic district presence versus maintaining its more recent four - decade reputation as “ Dirty 6th ” where young folks go to get shitfaced .
Phew .
That ’s a lot to take in right there .
What do you think about all of this ?

Police officers in Bay City , Mich. , are being called domestic terrorists after renting billboard space to trumpet that the layoffs of five police officers in the town could lead to more shootings , stabbings , robberies and beatings .
The police say they paid for the two billboards that went up last week to bring attention to the impasse in negotiations between its union and city officials , who are seeking a 10.8 percent reduction in labor costs from eight unions to tackle a $ 1.66 million budget deficit for the fiscal year that began July 1 .
The billboards also spotlight the city 's decision to replace the roof on city hall for $ 1.6 million .
" City Hall 's Roof Will Not Stop You From Getting : Beaten , Shot , Stabbed , Robbed .
5 Laid Off Bay City Cops Could Have ! " one billboard reads .
The other one shows a masked gunman and reads , " POSSIBLE .
The result of Bay City Commissioners laying off five police officers . "
" I think it 's distasteful and harmful to the community , " Commission President Christopher Shannon told FoxNews.com .
" I do n't know what they wish to gain as far as good faith negotiating .
I think it really drives a wedge somewhat between those of us who are trying to come up with reasonable compromises and those that are on the other side of it . "
The city reached a deal with the firefighters ' union before the deadline of June 30 and says it is on the verge of inking contracts with three other unions that would reduce labor costs .
But the police asked for a raise during its round of negotiations , Shannon said .
" As it turned out , as deadlines approached no one had really made any meaningful progress so we had to issue layoffs , " Shannon said , noting that the city is bound by state law to present a balanced budget by June 30 .
" It was n't the best option , but the only option we had given the fiscal pressures we were facing . "
The layoffs bring the number of officers below 60 for a population of 35,000 , Mayor Charles Brunner told FoxNews.com .
The city has given all unions a deadline of Aug. 31 to ink a contract .
Employees who were laid off can be rehired if a deal is reached before then .
Shannon said the billboards are scaring the residents and that consensus of the community , which has reached out to the commission , is that the ads are domestic terrorism .
But the police union says it 's trying to draw attention to the layoffs .
" Well , it definitely got the message across , " said Don Aldridge , the treasurer and secretary of the police force , when asked if the billboards went too far .
" It 's a reality though , " he told Fox News .
" When you 're out there on the streets dealing with violence each and every night , you know , that 's what it is and it was designed to motivate our citizens to contact their commissioners and tell them that they support their police department .
Brunner said that he believes the billboards might be " a little over the top , but certainly alerts the public to the five layoffs . "
But Brunner added that he does n't think the billboards will have any effect on salvaging the five positions .
" I assume the police department is going to the court of public opinion because the city commission has already weighed in , " he said .
Brunner said his top priority is public safety and that he vetoed the contract for the new roof , but his veto was overridden by the commission in a 6 - 3 vote .
" These are difficult times and requires some decisions that are very controversial , " Brunner said .
" I respect the decisions the commission made .
I just have a strong emphasis on public safety .
I 'm just a little nervous and concerned for the direction we 're heading in because of economics and I think we 're at a point where we need to establish some priorities . "
In 2009 , there were two homicides ( up from one in 2008 ) , 38 rapes ( down 54 percent from the previous year ) and 112 aggravated assaults ( up 10 percent ) in Bay City , according to the police department .
Shannon said if the billboards are to be taken seriously and the police force believes it has lost its ability to protect and service , " it really forces me as commission president in Bay City , Mich. , to put together a committee to explore contracting services out to the sheriff 's department " and other local law enforcement agencies .
" If they can not do their job …we have to consider alternatives to provide public safety , " he said .
Toronto Police are investigating whether numerous officers on G20 duty failed to wear proper identification .
At issue is whether officers violated a force requirement to wear epaulettes with their badge numbers and name tags on their uniforms , regardless of whether they ’re wearing riot equipment or standard police outfits .
“ It ’s a professional standards issue and / or potentially an issue of misconduct .
It ’s rightly being looked at by ( the ) Professional Standards ( unit ) , ” police spokeswoman Meaghan Gray said .
Police flagged the issue for internal review after the Star showed police four photographs in which officers appear not to be wearing name tags .
Officers have been required to wear name tags since the police services board demanded them in 2005 in a bid to make policing more transparent and accountable .
Missing name tags could lend themselves to protecting police misconduct , potentially keeping people from identifying individual officers when filing complaints , said Nathalie Des Rosiers , of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association .
“ It raises the prospect that rogue police officers who decided to protect themselves individually and prefer not to be identified knew that they were breaking the law — and that ’s a problem , ” she said .
Before the summit , Des Rosiers said , the association wrote to Police Chief Bill Blair with its concerns that officers might remove their name tags and badge numbers .
The practice was condemned when several officers did it during the London G20 summit in 2009 .
“ There is no excuse .
It ’s not to be anti-police to demand good policing in line with international standards , ” Des Rosiers said .
“ It ’s a symptom of disengagement and disregard of ( Toronto police ’s ) own good policing practices . ”
Potential violations captured in the photographs will be reviewed on a case - by - case basis , Gray said .
However , she declined to comment on the images directly .
“ I do n’t want to comment on those individual photos because I do n’t fully understand the circumstances behind those individual photos .
It would n’t be appropriate to make a comment or to speculate on the situation , ” she said .
“ I think it would be fair to say that that may be one of the issues the after - action team decides to look at . ”
The decision to require name and number tags , backed by Chief Bill Blair , followed a drawn - out , contentious debate .
Multiple reports , including a highly critical review of the police justice system by a former Superior Court chief justice , called for visible name tags to be part of police uniforms .
At a 2004 meeting , the board dismissed the argument of York University professor emeritus Harvey Simmons that names are easier to remember than badge numbers in the heat of an encounter with police .
“ Even when badge numbers are visible , given the charged atmosphere in which encounters with the police often take place , when people are excited or nervous , an average member of the public is highly unlikely to remember to note , memorize or write down an officer ’s badge number , ” Simmons said .
In a scathing report on London police ’s “ inadequate ” handling of the G20 protests , the Queen ’s Inspector of Constabulary recommended that the police don clear identification at “ all times during public order operations and deal with individual officer non-compliance swiftly and robustly . ”
The police commissioner had pledged that any officers caught deliberately covering their badge numbers would be fired .
However , a year after the summit , a second report revealed that there had been no formal discipline of the officers who failed to wear their badges , nor their supervisors .
A few officers were given a verbal warning .

Louise Bourgeois , an internationally revered artist whose intensely personal work was inspired by psychological conflict , feminist consciousness and a fertile imagination , has died .
She was 98 .
Bourgeois died Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan after suffering a heart attack on Saturday , said Wendy Williams , managing director of the Louise Bourgeois Studio in New York .
Known for sculptures of giant spiders , women with extra breasts , double - headed phalluses and rooms that resonate with loneliness and dread , Bourgeois was a fearless creative force whose work could be disturbing and perversely witty .
Although she got little attention from the art world until her seventh decade , she became its grande dame , constantly in demand and showered with honors .
Bourgeois often left viewers with questions about the meaning of her work , but made no secret of painful experiences that shaped it .
The spiders — including “ Maman , ” a 35 - foot - tall piece commissioned for the inauguration of the Tate Modern gallery in London in 2000 — are a tribute to her beloved mother , whom she described as a pillar of inner strength who was “ clever , patient and neat as a spider . ”

Her father , whom the artist perceived an a domineering philanderer , did n’t fare so well .
In “ The Destruction of the Father ” — a 1974 installation that appeared at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art in 2008 - 2009 , in a traveling retrospective — Bourgeois re-created a youthful fantasy of her father being dismembered and devoured by his family .
“ She smashed a taboo , ” said Christopher Knight , The Times ’ art critic .
“ Bourgeois was the first modern artist to expose the emotional depth and power of domestic subject matter .
Before her , male artists had only nibbled around the edges , and women just were n’t allowed . ”
Born in Paris on Christmas Day 1911 , Bourgeois lived in France until 1938 .
The second of three children born to Josephine Fauriaux and Louis Bourgeois , she was part of a family that operated a tapestry gallery below their apartment on Boulevard Saint - Germain and a tapestry restoration firm in a village south of Paris .
They had a comfortable life , except for a period during World War I , but her parents ’ marriage was fraught with tension that escalated when Louis had a liaison with an Englishwoman who was the children ’s live - in tutor .
Louise ’s resentment about the ménage à trois eventually became fodder for her art .
In a 1982 New York Times interview , she said that twisted forms in her work reflected her childhood dream of getting rid of her father ’s mistress by “ twisting her neck . ”
But Bourgeois ’ indomitable spirit and creative energy prevailed .

“ My work is a form of psychoanalysis , ” she wrote in an e-mail exchange with the Los Angeles Times in 2007 .
“ It is a way of coming to grips with my anxiety and fears .
It is an attempt to be a better person . …
There is a lot of ambivalence in the work .
There are many hanging pieces , which signify a fragile state .
There are pieces that oscillate and rock , which also convey fragility .
We all have pink days and blue days .
I am trying to seek a balance between the extremes that I feel .
I want to be reasonable . ”
In the art world ’s eyes , she succeeded .
Art historian Robert Storr has praised Bourgeois as “ among the most inquisitive and best - informed artists of her generation .
No analysis of her work or its internal dynamics that sidesteps this fact , or fails to consider the unique mix of intuition and erudition , psychological compulsion and sheer intelligence that has guided her , can possibly claim to measure the full range of its meanings . ”
Bourgeois studied art at several Parisian schools , including the Académie des Beaux - Arts and the Académie Julian , and in the studio of painter Fernand Legér .
In 1938 , she married American art historian Robert Goldwater and moved to New York , where she spent the rest of her life .

She began to establish herself as an artist in the 1940s while raising three sons , Michel , Jean - Louis and Alain , and had her first solo exhibition in 1945 at a New York gallery .
Her husband , a professor at New York University , became known for exploring connections between so - called primitivism and Western modernism .
The couple enjoyed a rich intellectual life until Goldwater ’s death in 1973 , about a decade before Bourgeois gained wide recognition .
She began her career as a painter of tapestry - like abstractions , but soon became intrigued with the Surrealists ’ exploration of the subconscious as a source of images and ideas .
Her “ Femme - Maison ” paintings of 1946 and 1947 merge Surrealism with feminism in depictions of women with houses for heads , defined by their domestic roles .
As her interest shifted to three - dimensional forms , she turned to sculpture and worked with many materials , including wood , metal , latex , plaster , marble and bronze .
Her early totem - like figures led to sexually explicit sculptures and ambitious installations that evoke troubling states of mind and physical conditions .
Bourgeois participated in feminist activities in the 1960s and wore the badge of feminism proudly while forging her own style and sensibility .
“ I believe women should have equal opportunity and rights , ” she wrote in her e-mail exchange with The Times .
“ My work does make fun of the macho man , whether it was my father or Freud . ”
But she rejected the notion of a feminist aesthetic .
“ My work deals with problems that are pre-gender , ” she wrote .
“ For example , jealousy is not male or female . ”

A 1982 retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York launched Bourgeois into a sphere of fame and influence well beyond Manhattan ’s contemporary art circles .
In the ensuing years , her work entered collections in major museums worldwide and she won dozens of awards , including the French Ministry of Culture ’s Grand Prix National de Sculpture in 1992 and the United States ’ National Medal of Arts in 1997 .
She represented the U.S. at the 1993 Venice Biennale and was the first living artist to have an exhibition at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg , Russia , in 2002 .
Her belated discovery by the art world was “ a blessing in disguise , ” she wrote to The Times .
“ It allowed me to work undisturbed , at my own pace and in my own way .…
I believe that when people see the work that I have produced over a long period of time they will see the consistency of what I want to say . ”
But when asked how she wanted to remembered in art history books , she responded : “ I ’m not that interested in art history .
I was married to an art historian and had enough of it .
Art history is one thing and being an artist is another .
I know I ’m part of history , just a tiny stone in a very big wall . ”
She is survived by sons Alain and Jean - Louis , two grandchildren and one great - grandchild .
Her son Michel died in 1990 .

Toxic tears ( Image : Raymond Mendez / Animalsanimals / OSF )
Species : Phrynosoma cornutum
Habitat : Dry and sandy areas of the southern US and Mexico , hiding in plain sight .
If ever there was an animal that said “ Do n’t even think about eating me , ” it would be the Texas horned lizard .
It has more defences than the Death Star , ranging from excellent camouflage to a subtle gift for risk assessment , bony defensive spines on its head and , best of all , a last - ditch retaliatory measure that is as gory as the legendary horror frog .

Around 7 centimetres long , the beast looks like a small armoured dinosaur that has been put in a trouser press .
Its body is flattened to the ground , helping to disguise it , as does its mottled skin .
Spines run down the side of the body and tail , and sprout all over the head – including two large ones on the top that look like horns .
It eats harvester ants called Pogonomyrmex , which would seem a pretty unappealing lunch : they possess some of the most toxic venoms known .
Hungry lizards capture the ants on their tongues and immediately swallow them , and folds in their throats then wrap them in threads of mucus that effectively immobilise them .
As a result , they can eat dozens of the insects without getting hurt .
But in turn , the lizards are hunted by a host of predators , including birds of prey , snakes and carnivorous mice .
Because their camouflage is so good they can often escape by sitting still , but sometimes that ’s not enough .
Squat or trot ?
William Cooper of Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne and Wade Sherbrooke of the American Museum of Natural History in New York decided to find out how Texas horned lizards responded to approaching predators .
They captured 45 lizards and placed them one by one in a large arena .
With a lizard at one end , Cooper crept up on it to see how close he could get before the lizard fled .
The first time he tried it with each individual lizard , the animals fled once he got within 1.3 metres .
When he repeated the test they were more jumpy , fleeing when he was 1.9 metres away .
Cooper also tried a second test , in which he stood still relatively close to a lizard looking away from it , and then turned either towards or further away from it .
The lizards ’ response to this depended on how close he was .
If he was 2 metres away , they did n’t flee even if he turned towards them , but if he was as close as 0.5 metres they ran even if he turned away .
Cooper and Sherbrooke argue that this means the lizards can judge how much risk a predator poses .
Earlier this year they also showed that the lizards are quicker to flee if a predator approaches at a run or if it heads straight for them rather than meandering in their general direction .
Armoured reptile
Many other animals make these sorts of judgements , balancing the risk of being eaten against the cost of having to run away , which might mean losing out on a food source or a chance to mate .
The brain mechanisms responsible may well be many millions of years old .
It ’s almost surprising that the Texas horned lizard has bothered to retain them , though , given how well - defended it is .
If a predator does see through its camouflage and the lizard can’t escape , it is anything but helpless .
First it turns side - on to the predator , advertising both its length and the spines running down its body .
If that ’s not enough it borrows a trick from pufferfish and inflates its body like a balloon .
This makes it more intimidating , and as a plus any animal actually attempting to swallow it is liable to choke to death .
Any predator brave or desperate enough to persist will get a nasty shock if it tries to bite the lizard .
The tough Texan bows its head , as if in prayer – with the result that the two horns on its head are likely to go through the roof of the predator ’s mouth .
Blood , blood , blood
As a last resort , the lizard will assault the predator by squirting a jet of blood out of its eyes .
This rather extreme weapon confuses the predator and allows the lizard to escape .
The lizard may release a third of its total blood supply this way , amounting to 2 per cent of its body mass , and the jet can travel several feet .
The blood is laced with noxious chemicals , which may come from the venomous ants that are the lizards ’ preferred diet .
Dogs are particularly vulnerable to the blood , and if they get sprayed they spend a while shaking their heads to get rid of it .
The lizards seem to know this and are more likely to use it on dogs than on other predators .
Autohaemorrhaging , as this gruesome trick is called , is moderately common in insects , but horned lizards seem to be the only group of vertebrates that do it .
It ’s a wonder anything ever does manage to eat them .

57 . Goat Pupils
Did you know that goats have rectangular pupils ?
Check it :
I always try to respek the recommendations of my friends , especially when it comes to rectangular affairs .
Sometimes they ’re really lame .
But sometimes my brilliant buds come up with great ideas .
This one I owe to Ms. Jenny Akchin , who pointed me here to explore the rectangular - goat - pupil - theory .
And – check it !
It ’s true .
Turns out there is a reason , of course .
Wikipedia taught me that goats have adapted rectangular pupils to increase their peripheral depth perception .
Whatever that means …
But guess what ?
Other animals have rectangleyes too !
Apparently “ cattle , deer , most horses and many sheep ” all share this special phenom .
Well , Jesus H. Christ .
Rectangles never cease to amaze , huh ?
If only I had realized this when I had my own special experience with the goat world .
Once my friend Daniel and I went to a “ living history plantation ” ( seriously ) and there was a petting zoo , consisting of two goats .
One of them ate my necklace .
I guess I was too distracted to check out his eyes .

Typing on the iPhone is like squeezing sausages into a soda can – you can get it to work , but it ’s not pretty .
BlindType is changing that .
The startup has created a new touchscreen keyboard program of the same name that changes size , orientation , and position to match your wandering fingers as they type .
BlindType also features some of the most impressive typing correction software I ’ve ever seen .
The result is a practical touchscreen interface that knows what you meant to type , even if you make mistakes .
Lots of them .
In fact , you can type without looking at the screen at all !
It ’s amazing , and I got to see it in person when I visited with BlindType creators Kostas Eleftheriou and Panos Petropoulos in San Francisco .
Check out their demonstration video below .
It ’s hard to believe that they developed this software in less than one year .
Because BlindType is still under development Kostas and Panos would only let me take still shots of the program .
Yet as you can see in their public demo video , BlindType lets the user be sloppy .
When I tried the program on an iPad I could relax about mistakes .
Not in spelling , but in the actual way I actually tried to hit keys on the touchscreen keyboard .
Do you have fat fingers like me ?
Not a problem .
Do your hands migrate slowly as you type ?
It can handle that too .
Hold your iPad to one side , type in progressively larger or smaller movements , even ditch the keyboard altogether .
BlindType can deal with it all .
Just watch and learn :
If you found the above demonstration for BlindType impressive , you ’re not alone .
The video received more than 300,000 hits in its first week .
Those are great numbers for a tech demo from a startup on YouTube .
Kostas and Panos were so impressed with the positive response they even created a follow up thank you video :
Why all the hullabaloo ?
BlindType is easing one of the biggest fears people have about touchscreen interfaces : they do n’t trust a keyboard without feedback .
BlindType does n’t let you feel the letters but it does give you a lot of confidence in your typing .
Kostas and Panos wanted a system that assumed the typist knew what they were doing .
If you type one letter on the right , another on the left , and you do n’t directly hit the keys , BlindType tries to figure out what you meant to hit .
Sometimes it can surprise you .
Kostas and Panos dared me to see how poorly I could type and still have the right word appear .
I typed without really looking at the keyboard and entered something like “ ubvunvryjankt ” .
BlindType knew I meant “ inconceivable ” .
I was amazed .
Kostas and Panos laughed , they get that all the time .
That ’s when I really felt challenged and I tried my absolute damnedest to defeat BlindType .
I ’m glad I did .
I learned how robust the system is .
We turned off the keyboard .
It did n’t appear on the iPad screen at all .
I typed in different directions , different speeds , and randomly changed the space I put between the letters I was trying to type .
BlindType handled it all with relative ease .
When I entered in new words the program did n’t know ( like my last name ) , a little menu popped up letting me store them in a custom dictionary with just one touch .
Easy .
Of course it ’s not perfect .
As Kostas and Panos helped me see , the program has limitations .
BlindType is a typing correcter , not a spelling correcter .
If you mistype a word by adding or subtracting a lot of letters , it does n’t work well .
It comes with a spell - checker / auto - correction feature ( or it will ) but do n’t expect it to perform wonders on both typing and spelling simultaneously .
It ’s good , but there ’s only so much decoding that ’s mathematically possible .
There ’s also limitations on the physical side of things .
You have the choice of leaving the spacebar enabled or disabled .
If you enable it , then there ’s a fixed point on an otherwise unfixed keyboard .
That means you have to actually hit the spacebar button where it ’s supposed to be – that ’s not always easy if you ’re typing sloppily .
If you disable the spacebar then spaces are inputed by swiping left to right .
That ’s a reasonable adaptation to ask of a user , but it takes a little getting used to .
And Kostas and Panos are still working out how to get the program to differentiate between very fast typing and swiping .
So if you type as fast as you possibly can sometimes the program thinks that two letters next to each other was actually you trying to make a swiping motion .
Same with resting your fingers on the touchscreen – right now the program thinks you are trying to make a long swipe .
Panos said they could solve that pretty easily in the future .
More limitations ?
Sure : if you have to swipe left to right , then as you rotate the phone ( or iPad ) you have to be careful about what direction it considers left to right .
There ’s a little arrow to help you keep track of this , and the program reorientates itself after every new word , but you can , if you ’re nasty , confuse BlindType by typing things upside down or backwards ( I told you I felt challenged ) .
Most users are n’t going to intentionally try to cause a failure though , so this is a very minor limitation .
All in all , I was simply blown away by how BlindType transformed me from a timid typist into a bold keyboard - challenging beast .
I was so confident in the program ’s skills ( in just a few minutes of using it ! ) that I was typing super sloppy and expecting the best .
And I got it the vast majority of the time .
With the product being so sound , I was naturally interested in how it worked , and how they developed it .
That ’s when Kostas and Panos got very tight - lipped .
They ’ve received so much attention , from apparently some big name people , that they ca n’t discuss anything .
They wo n’t even generally describe how BlindType approaches the problem .
I guessed it was analyzing the relative position between finger taps and they just gave me their best poker faces .
No revelations at all .
Kostas did allude to the fact that this is an AI project … but not much was said beyond that .
And BlindType is a small company , so there ’s little chance that the secrets will leak out .
In fact , BlindType really just has two employees : Kostas and Panos – cousins from Greece .
Though they ’ve had help with testing and such , the two of them essentially developed this program on their own .
That floored me .
How long did it take them to create it ?
A few months !
Though Panos admitted they have been thinking about it “ for about a year . ”
Just as they are reluctant to discuss the specifics of BlindType ’s inner workings , Kostas and Panos are not giving details about their funding or ongoing agreements with manufacturers .
Will it be installed on the manufacturing side or the consumer side ( like an App ) ?
No comment .
If it is consumer - side , will it be free , $ 1 , or $ 25 ?
No comment .
The only real answer I got from them is when I asked them if they had enough money to fund the rest of the program ’s development .
They gave me enigmatic smiles and said , “ oh , we ’ve got no worries . ”
Clearly they think BlindType is going to be big .
Will it succeed ?
Well , users are attracted to the promise of a better system , that much is clear .
Touchscreen keyboards and predictive text algorithms are also a big business .
Currently there are hundreds of millions of touchscreen devices sold each year and those numbers only look to rise as slate computers like the iPad gain ground .
Nearly every single one of these machines needs a virtual keyboard and associated auto- correction software .
When I asked Kostas and Panos which devices they were looking to port BlindType to , they simply said “ all of them . ”
Or at least as many as they could .
Their goal , which is also stated on their website , “ is to become the largest player in the industry . ”
The potential rewards of that industry are large .
Back in 1999 , the T9 predictive type software sold for $ 350 million in stock to AOL , though it was sold again in 2007 for just $ 269 M .
In the short term , BlindType is going to focus on mobile touchscreens .
The program runs on iPad and iPhone and will be running on Android phones soon .
That ’s millions of units right there .
But Kostas and Panos talked about it eventually being used on all kinds of touchscreens , from new PC desktops to street kiosks .
And what about phones with little plastic keyboards like the Blackberry ?
BlindType could easily be adapted to improve accuracy there too .
In fact , chances are that BlindType could be used in just about every keyboard ( virtual or physical ) there is .
Think about that .
This is a huge product .
It ’s probably coming to you soon .
While they wo n’t reveal specifics about product launch , Kostas and Panos said that beta testing will happen soon .
Working with the product as I did , it seemed really close to ready .
Kostas said that it takes about 150 milliseconds for BlindType to process each word , and the industry standard is 200 ms , so that ’s a good sign this product is good to go .
As BlindType makes more announcements about it ’s progress , we ’ll keep you up to date .
And what does all of this have to do with the Singularity and accelerating technology ?
Artificial intelligence is analyzing flawed human output and predicting what the person ‘ really meant ’ .
There ’s a lot of potential there .
BlindType is a narrow application , but as AI gets better at interpreting human input , it will let us use machines more naturally .
Right now we ’re worried about virtual keyboards , but think about brain computer interfaces .
Computers wo n’t just have to decode sloppy typing , they ’ll have to decode sloppy thoughts .
Programs like BlindType are only the beginning .
As machines and humans become more interconnected , we ’ll need more ingenious ways of building confidence in those connections .
Kostas and Panos may have solved virtual keyboard problems in a few months .
Let ’s hope our future user interfaces will be able to be improved as quickly .

I ’m often asked about how much people charge for photography , and then frequently in the context of portrait photography .
I guess people really like to get their picture taken .
Honestly , I tell them I do n’t really know what other people charge since I ’m new to the area and only really know the rates in the big cities in the US .
A guesstimate I give them is 500 for a session on the high end and that is for professional quality prints and props to boot .
If you want your wedding done its gonna cost more in the 3000 dollar range for a days work .
This is , in fact , true – it ai n’t cheap to get photographed – but have you ever thought about why that might be ?
Here are some of the reasons why photography aint cheap .
It goes without saying that weddings are a costly affair .
From the venue to the caterer to the wedding favors , the tab just keeps getting higher , and it often seems that wedding photographers are charging a large chunk of that tab .
But have you ever though why wedding photography prices are so high ?
It ’s because of the associated costs of being a wedding photographer .
The same can be said about a portrait photographer .
He has his studio , insurance , assistants and promotions .
Rent is not cheap in this area and you have to display yourself in the most professional manner possible to attract clients .
Being a good photographer is an expensive investment .
Sure , you can find cheap photographers out there , but they ’re cheap because they ’ve possible cut corners on equipment , and insurance .
Or they ’re just plain stupid ( you hired cheap and stupid ? )
So let ’s take a look at what goes into a photographer ’s overhead that adds up to the final cost of your photographer .
Equipment
The pieces of equipment a photographer carries around is not your typical point - and - shoot .
High - end lenses and bodies average around 2000 each .
Photographers also carry back - up equipment in case their primary equipment fails , which adds to the cost of the wedding photography prices .
Good photographers easily can bring over 15,000 worth of equipment to a shoot .
Add in the prices of computers and editing programs like photoshop ( you did buy it right ? ) and costs begin to skyrocket .
Education
The more education a photographer has , the better he will be technically when he shoots you .
College is not cheap this day in age as we all know .
Intangibles such as expertise are n’t easy to measure monetarily , although we try !
Staff salaries
If you book a photographer that comes with assistants or second photographers , your cost is going to be higher .
In return for getting more images from various places on your day , your photographer is going to have the pay those assistants .
Insurance
As I said before a photographer can bring upwards of 15,000 dollars worth of equipment to a shoot .
Because cameras and equipment cost so much , photographers are smart to insure them .
You never know when something or someone is going to damage your equipment and insurance is vital if you intend on staying in business .
Labor
This one is pretty standard across all industries .
A photographer ’s work does n’t end when your wedding does .
Photographers spend 5 – 10 hours plus enhancing your images ( removing your wrinkles and acne so you like the pictures ) .
This is not fun , but we do it to make you happy and it costs money and our time .
Web site
In this day and age , a photographer has to market himself with a very high - tech , professional Web site , which can cost a lot to design and maintain if the photographer does n’t have web design skills .
With Google ads and website updates , it ’s not uncommon for a photographer to spend upwards of 5,000 a year for the web work and marketing .
Advertising
In that same vein , photographers also have to spend money on other types of advertising such as ads in the newspaper , business cards and brochures .
Photo extras
Those books your pictures come in are not cheap .
A typical album can cost upwards of 100 dollars and that is usually included in the price of the shoot .
Not to mention the time it takes to create a well designed album .
Conclusion
So it just goes to show that the seasoned professional out there is going to bring a lot to the table when you hire him over the moonlighting weekend amateur .
It ’s up to you if it ’s worth more to go with a pro or just take a guy off the bench .
But who would you rather have shooting the final shot in the NBA championships , Kobe Bryant or me ( analogy , but I just might make the shot :D )
Faulty hose has been replaced and technicians are moving towards finally closing off flow into Gulf of Mexico , say officials
BP engineers trying to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico have fixed a leak in the new containment system and are preparing to start critical pressure tests of the cap , the company has said .
Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice - president of exploration and production , said the team had replaced the defective hose and would launch the test later today .
" We landed it this morning , " Wells said of the replacement hose .
" I 'm expecting that we 'll start up ( the test ) here later this morning , sometime today . "
The cap , installed on Monday , is a crucial step toward a four - vessel oil capture system that is hurricane - ready and can collect up to 80,000 barrels a day .
The first of two relief wells is expected to intercept and plug the leak by mid-August .
It represents the best hope yet of stopping the oil from leaking into the sea since the 20 April Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11 people .
The company has come under increasing pressure in the United States amid reports that it lobbied the British government for the release of the Lockerbie bomber in what is being called an oil - for - terrorist deal .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , pledged to consider Congressional demands for an investigation into the charges that BP pushed for the release of Abdel Basset al - Megrahi to help it clinch lucrative drilling contracts off the coast of Libya .
Tests of the latest containment attempt began with BP shutting off pipes that were funnelling some of the oil to ships on the surface , meaning the full force of the gusher went up into the cap .
Deep - sea robots began slowly closing three openings that let oil pass through .
Ultimately the flow of crude will be blocked entirely .
Engineers watched pressure readings to check whether the well was intact .
The first two are simple on - off valves .
The third – the one with the leaking hose – is closed gradually and takes longer .
Retired coastguard Admiral Thad Allen , who is overseeing the government response to the disaster , said a committee of scientists and engineers would monitor the results and assess them every six hours .
The test would end after 48 hours to evaluate the findings .
" I was gung - ho for this test and I remain gung - ho for this test , " he said .
If the cap works it will enable BP to stop the oil from gushing into the sea , either by holding it back like a stopper or , if the pressure is too great , channelling some through lines to as many as four collection ships .
The cap was lowered on to the well on Monday .
But before BP could test it the government intervened because of concerns about whether the buildup of pressure from the gushing oil could rupture the walls of the well and make the leak worse .
Allen said : " We sat long and hard about delaying the tests . "
He said the pause was necessary in the interests of the public , the environment and safety until officials were convinced the test could go ahead .
Allen said the testing would offer insight into the other more permanent solution to the fix : two relief wells intended to plug the gusher from deep underground .
The mapping of the sea floor that was done to prepare for the well cap test and the pressure readings will help determine how much mud and cement will be needed to seal off the well .
Drill work was stopped on one relief well because it was not clear what effect the testing of the cap could have on it .
Work on the other relief well had already been stopped according to plan .
The government estimates 1.5 m to 2.5 m gallons are leaking every day .
The latest effort to control the gushing well follows a string of failed attempts by BP to contain the leak , including the use of a giant concrete and steel box that quickly became encased in gaseous ice ; a colossal siphon tube that trapped very little oil ; and an effort to jam the well by pumping in mud and shredded rubber .
As of Wednesday , the 85th day of the disaster , 92 m to 182 m gallons ( 348 m to 689 m litres ) of oil had spewed into the Gulf since the rig leased by BP exploded .
Image caption A much diminished outline is apparent in the latest images
New images appear to confirm that Nasa 's Phoenix lander broke apart during Mars ' winter .
The static spacecraft , which was sent to study the planet 's " high Arctic " , lost contact with Earth in late 2008 .
Phoenix would have been covered by carbon dioxide ice , and Nasa always said it was likely the mission would be destroyed in such harsh conditions .
The latest pictures taken from orbit show Phoenix to have a smaller outline , indicating it was badly damaged .
" Before and after images are dramatically different , " said Michael Mellon of the University of Colorado in Boulder , a science team - member for both Phoenix and the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter which acquired the new data .
" The lander looks smaller , and only a portion of the difference can be explained by accumulation of dust on the lander , which makes its surfaces less distinguishable from surrounding ground . "
Image caption Phoenix was sent to Mars with seven science instruments
The difference in the pattern of shadows is said to be consistent with the predictions of how Phoenix could be damaged by the build up of frost .
It was expected the panels would bend and buckle under the weight of many tens of kilos of ice .
Launched from Earth in August 2007 , the robot arrived on Mars on 25 May 2008 , landing further north than any previous mission to the Martian surface .
To make it down , the probe had to survive a fiery plunge through the Red Planet 's thin atmosphere , releasing a parachute and using thrusters to control its descent .
The mission was scheduled to last just three months on the surface , but continued to work for more than five months .
During its ground operations , the robot dug , scooped , baked , sniffed and tasted the Martian soil to test whether it has ever been capable of supporting life .
Phoenix 's major achievement was in becoming the first mission to Mars to " touch water " in the form of the water - ice it found just centimetres below the topsoil .
Chunks of ice were seen to vaporise before the lander 's cameras .
" It 's just unfortunate that something like this has come up at a time when we 're really heavily dependent on the integrity of the 39th .
We 've had some recent shootings and we 've been working the community trying to establish a sense of safety and security , and our first point of contact is always the 39th District . . ..
We work very closely with the community relations people there .
It 's a long running relationship .
Its unfortunate that this happens because you 're going to end up losing the trust of the community and we worked so hard to establish that .
When you pick up a game for the first time , you 're often subjected to tutorial levels or sections that hold your hand until you master the game 's mechanics ... and these sections can last an uncomfortably long time .
It 's no wonder that many of us often find solace in the high - concept games of the classical arcade era , that beautiful time in the 1980s when Pac - Man was god and Defender was thought to be too damn confusing .
There is one game that towers above even those in my — admittedly minority — opinion : Robotron 2084 .
The game popularized the twin - stick design , where one joystick moved your character and the other controlled your direction of fire .
( You only had one weapon . )
The joysticks were of course digital back then , so you could only move and shoot in eight directions .
There was no scrolling and there were no surprises .
The game showed you the entirety of the level for a second before play began ; you had a tiny moment to see the four walls and to take in where the enemies were and in what numbers .
This was the game 's way of bowing at you before the attack .
Four walls , monstrous enemies , a human family
Robotron 2084 was , above everything else , fair .
It showed you everything it had , and then it tried to kill you .
The game 's story is minimal : you are a superhuman in the titular year , fighting to save surviving humans from the robots hellbent on destroying their humanity .
Before the game even begins things have gone to hell , and the game gives you a sense of desperation even with the limited graphics and colors of the time .
These are n't just survivors , you 're told , this is " the last human family . "
You 're put in an impossible situation , and you can try to fight your way out , but in the end you will succumb to the enemy 's advanced numbers .
Can we imagine that Eugene Jarvis , the creator of both Defender and Robotron 2084 , felt some impending doom or lost someone close to him ?
In both games you have to save nearly helpless humans from an encroaching threat .
In his mind , who were these people ?
Why was destruction so assured ?
In 1990 , Jarvis helped to further chase these concepts with the also - classic Smash TV , but that game does n't elicit the same kind of primal reaction Robotron enjoyed .
In Smash TV , the player fights in a sort of Running Man-esque game show for cash and prizes against waves of enemies that enter the arena .
There is no one to save , and new waves enter the arena as each level progresses .
In Robotron , you begin the game in the middle of the screen , with every enemy you 're going to fight in that level already on display .
There are no surprises , there is nothing hidden up the game 's sleeve .
This is a deal you will rarely get in life , an experience that calmly shows you everything it has to offer before throwing it all at you .
The dual - stick shooter is an overdone style among each console 's digital distribution services .
Notable examples include Geometry Wars , Everyday Shooter , and Super Stardust HD .
But there was a certain power in the simplicity of Robotron .
After a while , players begin to look through the screen , trying to find the patterns and an ephemeral path through the attacking hordes in order to survive until the next level .
There is nothing else to worry about or to work out .
Who needs scrolling levels ?
Who needs surprises ?
Robotron is a fist fight between you and a worthy opponent .
It feels like a duel , even if the flashing graphics suggest a sickly sweet radioactive nightmare .
Everything is sharp noises and bright colors , but the gameplay , if nothing else , is honorable .
Today , everyone respects it , but everyone thinks they can improve the mechanics in some way ...
Bliss is finding an arcade with a well - maintained machine that still runs on a single quarter .
If the time comes when I can't find one , I 'll buy one for our basement and teach my sons to play properly .
Robotron 2084 , in some ways , teaches you to be a gentleman .
Albeit a slightly brutal one .

The Chief Executive of the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) Giovanni Bisignani called recent union - led walkouts at major airlines “ nonsense , ” and demanded that they “ stop picketing and cooperate , ” at the IATA ’s annual meeting yesterday , in Berlin .
Aggregately , airlines will enjoy a 2.5 billion dollar ( USD ) profit this year ( 2.1 billion EUR ; 1.7 billion GBP ) , a marked improvement over the IATA 's March forecast .
However , this latest forecast includes European - based carriers , which , aggregately , are expected to lose 2.8 billion USD ( 2.3 billion EUR ; 1.9 billion GBP ) due to the severe interruption in operations caused by the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull , in south - central Iceland , over this past April and May .
For the year , the German airline Lufthansa had already lost 59.7 million USD ( 49.9 million EUR ; 41.4 million GBP ) due to a pilots ’ walkout in February , which Lufthansa received a German court order to stop .
The United Kingdom ’s British Airways has lost 173.2 million USD ( 145 million EUR ; 120 million GBP ) over the course of the several cabin crew union strikes against it which have occurred in the last few months .
Despite this , British Airways ’ CEO Willie Walsh called it “ business as usual ” at the U.K. ’s highest - profile airline .
Mr. Walsh has been criticized by the leaders of Unite the Union , which represents British Airways ’ cabin crew employees , for going to Berlin for the IATA meeting instead of staying in London to negotiate .
The IATA was founded in 1945 , and has been headquartered in Montreal , Québec , Canada since 1977 .
As of this post , it represents 230 airlines , on all six inhabited continents .
The legal and business entity now called Lufthansa was founded in 1954 .
Lufthansa is based in Cologne , Germany , and is the German flag carrier .
It is the largest airline headquartered in Europe , by number of passengers carried .
British Airways is based in the borough of Hillingdon in London and uses nearby Heathrow Airport ( IATA : LHR ; ICAO : EGLL ) as its hub .
It was formed in 1974 , with the merger of the British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways .
Unite the Union is a British and Irish trade union formed in 2007 with the merger of Amicus the Union and the Transport and General Workers ’ Union .

The PDSA holds a yearly slimming competition for dogs
More than a third of dogs in the UK are overweight , veterinary charity PDSA has warned .
The charity conducted an assessment of almost 30,000 dogs across the UK over the past four years and found 35 % of pets were carrying too many pounds .
Four years ago the figure was 21 % , and PDSA warns that if the trend continues , almost half of all dogs could be overweight by 2013 .
The charity said obesity posed a threat to the animals ' health and lifespan .
Senior veterinary surgeon Sean Wensley said : " Overweight pets are less mobile , less willing to play and more likely to develop a number of serious health conditions .
" Ultimately , owners control their pet 's diet and exercise .
The good news is it 's never too late to achieve positive change with their veterinary practice . "
As part of efforts to highlight the problem PDSA is relaunching its annual pet slimming competition , Pet Fit Club , which aims to encourage owners to get their pets to lose weight .
In 2009 , it was won by Labrador Keano , from Plymouth , who after shed 1st 6lbs ( 10kg ) .
He was so overweight at 7st 2lbs ( 46kg ) , he could not roll over on his back before joining the PDSA scheme , but regular walks and proper dog food helped him find a new lease of life .
There may be a biological reason why depression and other stress - related psychiatric disorders are more common among women compared to men .
Studying stress signaling systems in animal brains , neuroscience researchers found that females are more sensitive to low levels of an important stress hormone and less able to adapt to high levels than males .
" This is the first evidence for sex differences in how neurotransmitter receptors traffic signals , " said study leader Rita J. Valentino , Ph.D. , a behavioral neuroscientist at The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .
" Although more research is certainly necessary to determine whether this translates to humans , this may help to explain why women are twice as vulnerable as men to stress - related disorders . "
The research appears online in Molecular Psychiatry .
The study 's first author is Debra A. Bangasser , Ph.D. , a fellow in Valentino 's laboratory .
It has long been recognized that women have a higher incidence of depression , post - traumatic stress disorder , and other anxiety disorders , said Valentino , but underlying biological mechanisms for that difference have been unknown .
Her research focuses on corticotropin - releasing factor ( CRF ) , a hormone that organizes stress responses in mammals .
Analyzing the brains of rats that responded to a swim stress test , Valentino 's team found that in female rats , neurons had receptors for CRF that bound more tightly to cell signaling proteins than in male rats , and thus were more responsive to CRF .
Furthermore , after exposure to stress , male rats had an adaptive response , called internalization , in their brain cells .
Their cells reduced the number of CRF receptors , and became less responsive to the hormone .
In female rats this adaptation did not occur because a protein important for this internalization did not bind to the CRF receptor .
" This is an animal study , and we cannot say that the biological mechanism is the same in people , " said Valentino , adding that other mechanisms play a role in human stress responses , including the actions of other hormones .
However , she added , " researchers already know that CRF regulation is disrupted in stress - related psychiatric disorders , so this research may be relevant to the underlying human biology . "
Furthermore , said Valentino , much of the previous research on stress disorders in animal models used only male rodents , so important sex differences may have gone undetected .
" Pharmacology researchers investigating CRF antagonists as drug treatments for depression may need to take into account gender differences at the molecular level , " she said .
The National Institutes of Health provided funding support for this study .
Co-authors with Valentino and Bangasser were Andre Curtis , Ph.D. , Thelma T. Bethea , Ioannis Parastatidis , M.D. , and Harry Ischiropoulos , Ph.D. , all of The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia ; and Elisabeth J. Van Bockstaele , Ph.D. , of the Farber Institute for Neurosciences of Thomas Jefferson University .
PyFilesystem 0.3 released
I am pleased to announce a new version of PyFilesystem ( 0.3 ) , which is a Python module that provides a common interface to many kinds of filesystem .
Basically it provides a way of working with files and directories that is exactly the same , regardless of how and where the file information is stored .
Even if you do n't plan on working with anything other than the files and directories on your hard - drive , PyFilesystem can simplify your code and reduce the potential of error .
PyFilesystem is a joint effort by myself and Ryan Kelly , who has created a number of new FS implementations such as Amazon S3 support and Secure FTP , and some pretty cool features such as FUSE support and Django storage integration .
As an example of how awesome this package is , take a look at the following 6 lines of code , which creates a ramdrive :
from fs.osfs import OSFS from fs. memoryfs import MemoryFS from fs.expose import fuse home_fs = OSFS ( ' ~/' ) home_fs .
makedir ( ' ramdrive ' , allow_recreate =
True ) fuse .
mount ( MemoryFS ( ) , home_fs .
getsyspath ( ' ramdrive ' ) )
If you run this , a directory called ramdrive will appear in your home folder , the contents of which are stored purely in memory .
I prepared a screencast that gives a quick demonstration of some features – because if a picture is worth a thousand words , this video must be worth fifteen thousand words a second :
PyFilesystem screencast from Will McGugan on Vimeo .
See the project page on google code for more information , including API docs .
There are also a couple of blog posts that will give a some more context .
This release has reached a good level of stability and maturity .
I 'd like to invite as many Pythonistas as possible to check out this module and possibly contribute to the project .
As prolific as the CRAN website is of packages , there are several packages to R that succeeds in standing out for their wide spread use ( and quality ) , Hadley Wickhams ggplot2 and plyr are two such packages .
And today ( through twitter )
Hadley has updates the rest of us with the news :
just released new versions of plyr and ggplot2 .
source versions available on cran , compiled will follow soon #rstats
Going to the CRAN website shows that plyr has gone through the most major update , with the last update ( before the current one ) taking place on 2009 - 06 - 23 .
And now , over a year later , we are presented with plyr version 1 , which includes New functions , New features some Bug fixes and a much anticipated Speed improvements .
ggplot2 , has made a tiny leap from version 0.8.7 to 0.8.8 , and was previously last updated on 2010 - 03-03 .
Me , and I am sure many R users are very thankful for the amazing work that Hadley Wickham is doing ( both on his code , and with helping other useRs on the help lists ) .
So Hadley , thank you !
Here is the complete change - log list for both packages :
plyr 1.0 ( 2010-07-02 ) — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
( taken from the CRAN website )
New functions :
* arrange , a new helper method for reordering a data frame .
* count , a version of table that returns data frames immediately and that is
much much faster for high - dimensional data .
* desc makes it easy to sort any vector in descending order
* join , works like merge but can be much faster and has a somewhat simpler
syntax drawing from SQL terminology
* rbind.fill.matrix is like rbind .
fill but works for matrices , code
contributed by C. Beleites
Speed improvements
* experimental immutable data frame ( idata. frame ) that vastly speeds up
subsetting – for large datasets with large numbers of groups , this can yield
10 - fold speed ups .
See examples in ?idata .
frame to see how to use it .
* rbind . fill rewritten again to increase speed and work with more data types
* d*ply now much faster with nested groups
New features :
* d*ply now accepts NULL for splitting variables , indicating that the data
should not be split
* plyr no longer exports internal functions , many of which were causing
clashes with other packages
* rbind . fill now works with data frame columns that are lists or matrices
* test suite ensures that plyr behaviour is correct and will remain correct
as I make future improvements .
Bug fixes :
* ** ply : if zero splits , empty list ( ) , data. frame ( ) or logical ( ) returned ,
as appropriate for the output type
* ** ply : leaving .fun as NULL now always returns list
( thanks to Stavros Macrakis for the bug report )
* a*ply : labels now respect options ( stringAsFactors )
* each : scoping bug fixed , thanks to Yasuhisa Yoshida for the bug report
* list_to_dataframe is more consistent when processing a single data frame
* NAs preserved in more places
* progress bars : guaranteed to terminate even if ** ply prematurely terminates
* progress bars : misspelling gives informative warning , instead of
uninformative error
* splitter_d : fixed ordering bug when .drop = FALSE
ggplot2 0.8.8 ( 2010-07-02 ) — — — — — — — — —————-
( taken from the CRAN website )
Bug fixes :
* coord_equal finally works as expected ( thanks to continued prompting from Jean - Olivier Irisson )
* coord_equal renamed to coord_fixed to better represent capabilities
* coord_polar and coord_polar : new munching system that uses distances ( as defined by the coordinate system ) to figure out how many pieces each segment should be broken in to ( thanks to prompting from Jean - Olivier Irisson )
* fix ordering bug in facet_wrap ( thanks to bug report by Frank Davenport )
* geom_errorh correctly responds to height parameter outside of aes
* geom_hline and geom_vline will not impact legend when used for fixed intercepts
* geom_hline / geom_vline : intercept values not set quite correctly which caused a problem in conjunction with transformed scales ( reported by Seth Finnegan )
* geom_line : can now stack lines again with position = “ stack ” ( fixes # 74 )
* geom_segment : arrows now preserved in non-Cartesian coordinate system ( fixes # 117 )
* geom_smooth now deals with missing values in the same way as geom_line ( thanks to patch from Karsten Loesing )
* guides : check all axis labels for expressions ( reported by Benji Oswald )
* guides : extra 0.5 line margin around legend ( fixes # 71 )
* guides : non -left legend positions now work once more ( thanks to patch from Karsten Loesing )
* label_bquote works with more expressions ( factors now cast to characters , thanks to Baptiste Auguie for bug report )
* scale_color : add missing US spellings
* stat : panels with no non-missing values trigged errors with some statistics .
( reported by Giovanni Dall ’ Olio )
* stat : statistics now also respect layer parameter inherit.aes ( thanks to bug report by Lorenzo Isella and investigation by Brian Diggs )
* stat_bin no longer drops 0 - count bins by default
* stat_bin : fix small bug when dealing with single bin with NA position ( reported by John Rauser )
* stat_binhex : uses range of data from scales when computing binwidth so hexes are the same size in all facets ( thanks to Nicholas Lewin - Koh for the bug report )
* stat_qq has new dparam parameter for specifying distribution parameters ( thanks to Yunfeng Zhang for the bug report )
* stat_smooth now uses built - in confidence interval ( with small sample correction ) for linear models ( thanks to suggestion by Ian Fellows )

Epicurus is very clear that the desire for sex is generally bad for oneâ€™s peace of mind .
When we imagine Epicurus doing what he likes best , he is swinging in a hammock in his garden talking philosophy with his friends .
The frenzy of love making and its aftermath disrupts the calm and stately demeanor that comes with living a simple life , satisfying only oneâ€™s basic desires .
His motto is â€ œPlain living , high thinking .â€ 
Epicurus is very clear about this .
Desires are natural or vain , necessary or unnecessary .
Pursuing vain desires , like extreme wealth , pleasure or fame , is difficult , fretful and uncertain .
None of the vain desires are necessary , and we never find rest if we pursue them .
The necessary desires are for food , shelter , clothing , water and air .
With these the individual can maintain life .
Our happiness lies in cultivating a taste for the basics .
There is one desire , however , that Epicurus singles out for special attention , the desire for sexual pleasure .
Like the vain desires , the desire for sex is unnecessary for the survival of the individual , yet it is perfectly natural , like thirst or hunger .
We are built for sexual reproduction , and a maturing human animal will feel the stirring of sexual desire no matter what .
We are hardwired to find sexual attractions in the world .
As well as being natural , the desire for sex is necessary for the survival of the human race .
However , what is true of the species need not be true of every individual member .
If everyone were to take the advice of Epicurus , we would die out in a generation .
I suppose it is because of this that he sees sexual desire as natural .
Nevertheless , whatever fools the rest of us make of ourselves , Epicurus thinks that it is not a good idea for a wise person to pursue sexual relationships or to be entangled in them .
A good analogy may be todayâ€™s economic paradox .
Just as it is in the interest of each individual to get out of debt , live within a budget , and save some money for a rainy day , it is in the interest of consumer society that individuals spend beyond their means .
As Bernard Mandeville puts it , in his commentary to The Fable of the Bees , called â€ œPrivate Vices , Public Benefits , â€ the economy grows if people go into debt to buy things they do not really need , but it benefits the individual to remain debt free .
So it is with sex and Epicurus .
Humans must breed to keep the species going , but wise individuals refrain from doing so .
So what does Epicurus have against sex ?
First off , his objection is not against pleasure per se .
In fact , Epicurus judges the good and bad as what leads to pleasure or pain .
Also , he does not deny that sexual pleasure is the most intense physical pleasure that there is .
But , for him , that is a large part of the problem .
Sexual pleasure is too intense .
It disturbs our mind .
Think of the innumerable love songs about the craziness and blindness of love .
We are carried away and lose our ability to reason things out realistically .
The lover is outside the belovedâ€™s window in the dead of night singing songs of longing .
Look at all the fools for love and what happens to them : disaster after disaster .
What if oneâ€™s mighty love is unrequited ?
Oh , the agonies , weight loss , depression , bitter sweet memories when they are playing your tune .
Then , suppose you are successful .
You have a love and your love has you .
Now you need each other , or are stuck with each other , engaged in working and child rearing .
All of this bonding brings anxiety , concerns , hopes , fears , frustrations , pains and agitations of mind .
From all this bother , Epicurus sees an easy way out .
Cultivate friends , not lovers , and you will not experience the possessiveness or jealousy , the hate or anger of frustrated love .
You do not need your friends to be a certain way , and will accept them as they are .
Friends are happy to see each other , become totally engaged with each other while they are together , and then say good - bye and go their separate ways without pulling romantic heartstrings .
Sexual relations get one into trouble of mind , and this is precisely what Epicurus wants to teach us to avoid .
So is he right ?
I suppose that will depend upon whether or not one shares Epicurusâ€™ view of what will make us happy in this life .
If you think that peace of mind is the final desideratum and the essence of happiness , then it is true that oneâ€™s life runs more smoothly with fewer hostages to fortune , without erotic and then familial entanglements .
If the avoidance of all suffering is the goal of life , then avoiding sexual relationships might provide some relief .
However , if one deems it a richer life to have loving and erotic relations with others , and if one accepts the agitation that comes with them , then perhaps the advice of Epicurus is too bloodless .

A tough - talking , muscular Los Angeles police sergeant steadily rattled off tips to a young Marine riding shotgun as they raced in a patrol car to a drug bust :
Be aware of your surroundings .
Watch people 's body language .
Build rapport .
Marine Lt. Andrew Abbott , 23 , took it all in as he peered out at the graffiti - covered buildings , knowing that the lessons he learned recently in one of the city 's toughest neighborhoods could help him soon in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan .
" People are the center of gravity and if you do everything you can to protect them , then they 'll protect you , " he said .
" That 's something true here and pretty much everywhere . "
Abbott was among 70 Camp Pendleton Marines in a training exercise that aims to adapt the investigative techniques the LAPD has used for decades against violent street gangs to take on the Taliban more as a powerful drug - trafficking mob than an insurgency .
The Marines hope that learning to work like a cop on a beat will help them better track the Taliban , build relationships with Afghans leery of foreign troops and make them better teachers as they try to professionalize an Afghan police force beset by corruption .
The troops believe they can learn valuable lessons from the LAPD , which has made inroads into communities after highly publicized abuses , from the videotaped beating of Rodney King to corruption in an anti-gang unit .
" Their role is to win the hearts and minds of the community and that 's what they did , " said Marine Staff Sgt. Brendan Flynn , who also works as a Los Angeles police officer and will be deployed to help train Afghan police .
The weeklong exercise -- unbeknownst to the public -- involved Marines dressed in jeans and T - shirts observing drugs busts , witnessing prostitution arrests and even following a murder case .
It was the largest group of Marines to embed with the city 's officers .
Abbott , of Long Island , N.Y. , rode with Sgt. Arno Clair , a 16 - year veteran with salt - and - pepper hair who swims up to a mile a day .
During their afternoon together , police handcuffed a bus driver -- moments after he was caught by an undercover officer with $ 25,000 worth of crack cocaine outside an apartment complex in a south - central Los Angeles neighborhood long plagued by violent gangs .
The tattooed suspect wearing an earring and baggy shorts seemed a world away from the ragtag , Kalashnikov - toting Taliban fighters , just as the streets of south - central Los Angeles are from the dusty villages of mud-brick houses in Afghanistan .
But in many ways , police in Los Angeles ' crime - ridden neighborhoods use the same skills that Marines say could help them .
Marines are in charge of training Afghanistan 's army and police but often have no police experience themselves .
Their success in building effective police forces is considered key to stabilizing the country and allowing foreign troops to withdraw .
Marines also are changing their approach , realizing that marching into towns to show force alienates communities .
Instead , they are being taught to fan out with interpreters to strike up conversations with truck drivers , money exchangers , cell phone sellers and others .
The rapport building can net valuable information that could even alert troops about potential attacks .
Marines can gather intelligence by picking up the notebooks , receipts and other papers left behind in raids that could provide insight into the opium business the Taliban uses to buy their weapons , Afghan expert Gretchen Peters said .
She told Marines before the Los Angeles patrols that they should follow the lead of some Afghans who have gone from using the term " mujahadeen " or " holy warrior " to identify the Taliban to calling them gangsters .
That , she said , shows how fed up the villagers are with being extorted by them and calling them gangsters will win them over .
" Think of the Taliban as the Sopranos in turbans , " she said .
" I think essentially they 're criminals . "
Peters , who has written extensively about the Taliban being a criminal network , has been talking to troops across the country before they deploy to Helmand Province , a top opium - producing region .
Afghanistan supplies 90 percent of the world 's opium , the main ingredient of heroin , and is also the leading global supplier of hashish .
Last year , opium seizures soared 924 percent because of better cooperation between Afghan and international forces .
In the end , the police training mission is what will win the war , said Marine 2nd Lt. Jared Siebenaler , 24 , of Hastings , Minn. , who spent the past six months training police in Afghanistan .
But he acknowledged their police mission faces enormous challenges .
Siebenaler said many recruits tested positive for drugs , arriving to work high on hashish if they came at all .
Supervisors were believed to be skimming money off their officers ' measly salaries .
One force had men from two tribes who could barely stand each other .
And then there 's the language barrier between Marines and the Afghan police .
But like most police work , getting past issues of trust and cultural difference begins with a brief encounter on a street .
As Clair and Abbott cruised past a row of dilapidated homes , the police sergeant told him to notice how a person 's walk and dress changes from street to street , and whether children are playing or hurrying by .
Crime here increases with summer 's heat , he said , encouraging Abbott to identify the violence - trigger in Afghanistan , such as at the end of the poppy harvest .
" What 's happenin , ' man ? "
Clair said , waving his hand out his window to a man who looked away in disgust .
" If they are on the fence about police and they say 'hi ' back , then at least we 've dealt with that issue , and if they do n't , then at least I know who I 'm dealing with around here , " he told Abbott .
Abbott , following Clair 's example , waved to a woman in the street .
She waved back .
The Dutch have pulled off the upset , defeating Brazil to advance in the World Cup .
Brazil was the favorite coming into the tournament , and have won 5 World Cups in their history , while the Netherlands has won none .
So I think you ’ll forgive the country with the famous “ oranje ” fans if they do a bit of partying tonight .
My Dad moved to America from Holland when he was 10 , so I consider the Dutch my brothers .
In order to help my fellow countrymen celebrate I have prepared a gallery of their rabid fans .
The Netherlands is known for having some of the best fans in all of sport , I think you can see why :
For more sexy dutch fans , check out the girls of Bavaria Beer .
After my heart teacher , Thich Nhat Hanh , one of the first Zen teachers I read and studied extensively was Roshi John Daido Loori .
Founder of the Mountains and Rivers Order of Zen Buddhism , Roshi Loori is considered one the great American masters of the Zen koan system .
Although he recently passed on , you can find a wealth of his writings and lectures at Zen Mountain Monastery website , where he was Abbot .
I guess one of the things that really attracted me about Roshi Loori ’s teachings was that the man came across to me as the real deal — a “ no BS ” kind of Zen teacher who was also a rebel of the best sort .
As one of his students wrote in tribute to him , “ Although Daido Roshi first regarded himself as a staunch layperson and had little taste for certain of the ceremonial and authoritarian aspects of practice ( he famously threw back at Maezumi Roshi the first list of koans he received from him , declaring , “ I ’m not going to do these ! ” ) , he later moved in the direction of what he described as “ radical conservatism , ” a move he saw as necessary for authentic Zen practice to take root in America .
He later ordained as a Zen priest and eventually received dharma transmission from Maezumi Roshi , becoming a lineage holder in both the Soto and Rinzai schools of Zen Buddhism . ”
To convey something of the depth and spirit of Roshi Loori ’s teaching , here is an excerpt from a talk he gave on the Zen koan Dongshan and Shenshan Cross the River .
I hope you find , as I did after reading it , that you have whole new way of looking at “ mistakes ” and the meandering path to awakening !
A hazy autumn moon , solitary and full , falls as it may on the winding river ahead .
There are those who seek perfect clarity , yet sweep as you may , you cannot empty the mind .
( The Capping Verse to Dongshan and Shenshan Cross the River )
“ You ca n’t teach someone to walk a tightrope by telling them to move their muscles a certain way .
The only way to learn is by doing it .
Somehow your body acclimates to it , your mind learns , and it seeps into your subconscious .
It happens all at once .
Is the Dharma any different ?
Of course you ’re going to fail ; step after step after step .
Yet you will learn every time you fail .
You say you ’re going to stay with the breath , and pretty soon you start chasing after thoughts .
You acknowledge your distraction , you let it go , and you come back to the breath .
You keep doing this until you ’re able to stay with the breath .
After a while you get pretty good at it , but all of a sudden you seem to be back to square one and you ca n’t stay focused for even five seconds .
Your mind is all over the place .
Then it comes back .
Repeated practice creates learning .
Repeated mistakes create learning .
That is why Mistake is in reality called learning .
The state of no - mistake is called nowness .
It is called “ now . ”
It is called “ thus . ”
In nowness there is no before ; there is no after .
There are no goals , no agendas , no fixed direction .
There is just the moment .
It arrives as it departs , simultaneously .
It has no before or after .
It is so difficult for us to grasp this truth .
We need goals .
We want agendas .
We crave direction .
The notion of wandering aimlessly is very frightening for most of us …
The state of no - mistake is called nowness .
In nowness there is no before or after , no goals , agendas , or fixed direction .
Like the meandering river , it twists and turns in accord with circumstances , but always knows how to find its way to the great ocean .
When you are on the river , you may be paddling north for an hour , and suddenly there ’ll be a bend up ahead .
When you look at your compass , you see you ’re going south .
You may have to go the same length , except now you ’re paddling in the opposite direction .
Then you go east , then you go west , then north again .
Is the river making a mistake on its journey to the ocean ?
Should the river be like a pipeline , one straight channel without bends or curves ?
Think of a river flowing through the forest .
It is all curves and bends .
It changes from season to season .
When trees fall down and block it up , it rises up behind them , opening a new path .
It twists and turns in accord with circumstances .
It responds spontaneously , dealing with each moment as it comes up .
Ultimately , the river will make its way to the great ocean .
If you wish to travel like this you must go alone .
Alone .
Not lonely , but alone .
All one , containing everything .
And not carry any baggage .
Put down the backpack , take off the blinders .
Whatever you are carrying will affect what you do .
Most importantly ,
You must trust yourself implicitly .
Give yourself permission to be yourself .
The capping verse : A hazy autumn moon , solitary and full , falls as it may on the winding river ahead .
It falls as it may , randomly .
In its haziness , it is not controlled .
The hazy moon of enlightenment is imperfect .
Anuttara - samyaksambodhi is imperfect .
It has pimples and bumps .
It is the Tenth Ox-herding Picture with the old sagely guy stumbling through the marketplace with a bag on his back .
He is laughing at falling leaves , playing with children .
This is a step beyond the crystal - clear moon of enlightenment .
Dogen says , “ No trace of enlightenment remains , and this traceless enlightenment continues endlessly . ”
There are those who seek perfect clarity , yet sweep as you may , you cannot empty the mind .
Keizan Zenji said that .
Sweeping itself can sometimes fill the mind .
The simple activity of emptying fills it .
Remember , the whole thing is hopeless .
Taking care of the environment is hopeless , but we ’ll do it .
Achieving enlightenment is hopeless , but we ’ll do it .
Clarifying the mind , emptying the mind — impossible .
We ’ll do it .
Just like the Four Vows say : “ Sentient beings are numberless , I vow to save them . ”
How in the world are we going to do that , if they ’re numberless ?
“ Desires are inexhaustible , I vow to put an end to them .
The dharmas are boundless , I vow to master them .
The Buddha Way is unattainable , I vow to attain it . ”
Utterly hopeless .
Yet we ’re doing it .
We are Don Quixotes , jousting with windmills .
That is our practice .
The apparent impossibility does not make one bit of difference in our resolve .
What is required is the kind of tenacity , the kind of vow that comes out of this practice .
Imperfections notwithstanding , we will ultimately take care of this earth , and of each other .
That is our vow . ”

~~Original Post Date 12/7/2006 ~~
The Mainstream Media ( MSM ) never passes up an opportunity to show the American public ( and our enemies , as well ) the most horrible , shocking pictures it can lay its collective grubby hands on .
Even when the pictures are n't totally shocking , those charged with applying the captions to said photos do n't hesitate to invent the sentiment they want to be ascribed to the photos , even when it 's not remotely accurate .
Frequent contributor Mr2ears sent me the following shocking photos this morning , having received them from a friend of his who is a Vietnam veteran .
The photos show the horrible interactions between our troops serving in Iraq and children .
See how horribly the children are being treated .
See how our troops show them nothing but contempt , disdain , and an apparent eagerness to do evil to them .
( Had you goin ' there for a minute ?
Nope , did n't think so . )
Ah Prom – that unforgettable , coming - of - age , once in a lifetime experience that epitomizes adolescence .
Although much of the hype surrounding prom goes to the girl ’s dress , what the guy wears is equally as important .
To start , every guy needs to wear a tuxedo .
From a tuxedo nyc to a tuxedo on the coast of California ; this is the basis of every male ’s prom attire .
After that , give your look a little edge with these helpful style tricks .
Keep it you
People might think prom season is all about the girl , but when it comes to your tux ; keep it all about you .
Make sure your tux speaks to who you are ; if you want to add a hat , add a hat .
Crazy socks ?
Go for it .
Match your date
That being said , make sure you at least coordinate with your date .
Part of going as a couple is matching your attire .
This typically just means the same color bow tie and / or vest , so that you can still give your attire your own , unique design .
Be trendy
Even for a guy , the latest trends do matter .
Certain patterns , jacket styles , and combinations of styles are always trending .
For your best look yet , know which ones work well for you and flaunt it .
Remember the details
Do n’t think that girls are the only ones who are able to accessorize for prom .
Guys can show off their stylish side through funky shoes , unique bow ties , jewelry , even crazy socks .
These little details will make your prom experience and outfit that much more enjoyable to remember .
A tuxedo might be the first thing you need when going to prom , but even for guys it is n’t the only thing .
Tuxedos might be standard , but that does n’t mean your style has to be .
So bring on a fully - blown battle over public sector pensions .
Because of all the excessive government spending that goes on , the huge bill for these gold - plated , index - linked , final salary schemes for state workers is among the most difficult to swallow .
For one thing , as the IOD / IEA report makes clear , the disparity between occupational pensions in the public and the private sector is vast – and getting wider all the time .
As general pension provision crumbles , only 11 pc of private sector workers now enjoy the relative security of contributing to an employer pension scheme that will provide them with a retirement income proportionate to their final salary .

Gil Shefler contributed to this report .
A man associated with the outlawed Kach movement was arrested on Tuesday night by Jerusalem Police and the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) on suspicion that he stabbed a number of Palestinian men to death in the late 1990s , attempted to murder at least five more Palestinians , and illegally possessed weapons .
The suspect , Haim Pearlman , 29 , from Beit Rabban near Yavne , is said to have traveled in far - Right circles and has been described by security services as a member of the Kach movement .
He is married and has three children .
In 1998 and 1999 , security services allege , Pearlman went on a stabbing spree , killing three Palestinians in the Jerusalem neighborhoods of Mea She’arim and Abu Tor .
He allegedly tried to murder five more Palestinians in the Jerusalem area .
Pearlman denied all the allegations , and said in an interview recorded two days before his arrest and aired on Channel 2 on Wednesday night that he was being framed .
Pearlman ’s lawyer , Adi Keidar , toldon Wednesday , “ In the coming days , we will expose the unacceptable and shameful techniques used by the Shin Bet against my client .
My client has denied all wrongdoing . ”
Keidar added that he has been prevented from meeting with Pearlman for the time being .
“ In the condition that I was in , I would have confessed to killing Arlosoroff , ” Pearlman said during the Channel 2 interview , in a reference to Socialist Zionist leader Haim Arlosoroff , whose unsolved murder in Tel Aviv in 1933 was blamed on right - wing elements .
“ The Shin Bet gave me money to feed them information six months ago , ” Pearlman said .
He also accused his purported handlers of encouraging him to commit violent acts , including killing Sheikh Raed Saleh , the head of the Islamic Movement ’s Northern Branch , as part of the efforts to frame him .
An associate of Pearlman ’s told thethat the Shin Bet enticed Pearlman with cash payments to become an informer , but then cut links with him after realizing that the information he provided was worthless .
The associate added that audio recordings were made by Pearlman of Shin Bet “ He was a right - wing activist 10 years ago , but since then has left .
He could n’t get a teaching permit because of a past arrest during a disturbance related to the disengagement [ from Gaza and parts of northern Samaria in 2005 ] , ” the associate said .
“ He was in financial distress , so the Shin Bet exploited him .
They gave him hundreds of shekels for meeting with them , and kept in regular touch with him , asking him to provide them with information , ” the associate added .
The associate said that after realizing the information Pearlman was giving was false , undercover agents were sent to Givat Washington to put up posters advertising a job .
When Pearlman contacted the people who advertised the position , he realized they were Shin Bet agents , the associate said .
“ They crossed the line , and tried to cause him to commit violent acts .
These conversations were recorded by him .
When the Shin Bet realized they were being recorded , they framed him , out of revenge , ” the associate claimed .
The associate claimed to have heard the recordings .
“ In one tape , an agent is heard saying , ‘ Let ’s go to a village in the North ...
It ’s not a problem to take out Salah .
You open fire on the vehicle ...
You have to empty out the cartridge ...
Or you can plant a bomb , ’ ” he said .
“ Why was he arrested now , when the cases are more than 10 years old ? ” he said .
“ There is no doubt this is revenge . ” Pearlman appeared at the Petah Tikva Magistrate ’s Court on Wednesday , where his custody was extended by a day , despite attempts by the police representative to get it extended by 15 days .
His next remand hearing will be held on Thursday at the Jerusalem Magistrate ’s Court .
Pearlman was arrested in the past for waving an Israeli flag on the Temple Mount , but was acquitted .
He was also arrested for attacking an Arab man during the funeral of Binyamin and Talia Kahane in 2000 .
Binyamin , the son of Kach founder Rabbi Meir Kahane , and his wife were shot dead in their van by Palestinian terrorists while driving in the West Bank .
The Shin Bet fully lifted a media gag order on the case late Wednesday night and released a statement saying : “ Pearlman was arrested on suspicion of carrying out severe offenses , including a series of murders of Arabs and additional terrorist attacks against Arabs .
The decision to arrest Pearlman came after months of intelligence efforts in conjunction with the Israel Police and the state prosecution .
The efforts ... included a number of meetings held between Shin Bet members and Pearlman ... and other intelligence - gathering operations aimed at consolidating information on him .
” The Shin Bet rejected claims that Pearlman had been framed .
Shmuel “ Zangzi ” Meidad , the founder of Honeinu , a human rights organization that is helping to defend Pearlman , commented about the arrest .
“ Soon , new information will come to light that will shock Israel in the revelation of how the Shin Bet works , ” Meidad said , adding that he was not at liberty to go into specifics .
“ From my understanding , Pearlman may have been duped into carrying out killings by the Shin Bet . ” Meidad said Pearlman was a normative person whose weaknesses were exploited by the security services .
July 's been a busy month for dictionary makers
Darlene Heslop " sighed and rolled her eyes " according to a story in the Chicago Tribune .
For that she got ejected from the June 14 meeting of the City Council in Elmhurst , IL .
I 'm serious .
Now , according to the Tribune 's Editorial , the Elmhurst City Attorney has been directed to research the legal definitions of disorderly conduct and disruptive behavior apparently as a precursor to drafting an ordinance " to curb non-verbal outbursts . "
There is already a state law defining disorderly conduct as " an act in such unreasonable manner as to alarm or disturb another , or to provoke a breach of the peace .
" Somehow , to me , neither sighing nor rolling your eyes , even if done more - or - less simultaneously at a meeting of elected officials , seems likely to provoke a breach of the peace .
A snort ?
Maybe .
A chuckle or two , even ?
Perhaps .
First we have the new verb , as in " " to describe taking something so egregiously out of context that it takes on a meaning opposite from what was originally intended .
Now we also have the new verb , as in " , " meaning he caused members to walk out undermining the meeting quorum yet succeeded in wasting tax - payer money by sending an attorney on a wild goose chase - over somebody sighing and rolling their eyes .
Is it any wonder voters seem hard - pressed to trust elected officials to bring value to their work ?
To delegate to an attorney the task of devising a way to control facial expressions sounds like some farcical Monty Python sketch .
Sadly , it 's not - it 's the state of the city in Elmhurst , IL .
A new research report from GigaOm asks an intriguing question .
Why is the smart grid resisting open source ?
As Katie Fehrenbacher notes at Earth2Tech , the only major proponent is the U.S. Department of Energy , whose labs have used it to test designs before they 're implemented .
Vendors all have their excuses ( it 's risky , we like our vendors , we want to maximize profit from anything we install ) but I suspect something else is in play .
No one is making them do it .
There are some great tools coming .
OpenADR from the Berkeley National Laboratory .
The OpenADE interfaces from OpenSG .
OpenPDC , developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority .
Open source , and open processes , deliver open standards that make solutions more affordable .
Yet utility companies resist , and so far they are getting away with that resistance .
The GigaOm report was put together by Jeff St. John ( not the self - help author , not the musician ) , a fine writer who understands the urgency of the problem .
We may be at peak oil , but electrical grids run on coal , and there is plenty of coal to fry this globe to a cinder , if utilities are allowed to burn it .
The fact is that electric utilities are not just " private businesses . "
They are regulated entities , given monopoly status , built by the forced payments of customers over decades .
( Like the phone and cable companies . )
There is a bargain inherent in that status , one that goes back to the 19th century .
Your scope of control can be limited by the needs of the public interest .
The only reason utilities get away with ignoring this bargain is because the Administration is not pushing them on it .
Republicans seem to believe Jay Gould and Jim Fisk were terribly put upon by that mean General Grant and the Panic of 1873 was some sort of natural disaster .
( Just like the one we 're now going through . )
My personal blog takes a different , more urgent view .
There is a basic conflict in our economy between the idea that energy comes from resources and one that energy comes from devices which can harness the energy all around us .
This conflict has yet to be engaged by policymakers .
I sometimes think of it as an Ace kicker in the poker hand of any politician willing to play it .
( The incumbent is a poker player , as this guy was . )
The refusal by utilities to consider using open standards and open source in upgrading their plant is the canary in the coal mine of this whole crisis .
It 's as obvious in its way as the BP oil spill .
At some point we either confront this threat to our economic future or let short term interests define it for us .
Which explains the picture at the top of this post , a cartoon originally published in the Cincinnati Post over a century ago .
As Long - Term Unemployment Deepens , 99ers Look for Answers
Created : June 10 , 2010 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Cindy Paoletti's home - state senators , Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand , have indicated they might be willing to extend unemployment benefits beyond 99 weeks .
( EPA / ZUMAPRESS.com )
For 23 years , 58 - year - old Cindy Paoletti of Salina , N.Y. , worked in the corporate accounting division of J.P. Morgan Chase , balancing payroll accounts in an upstate office of the Wall Street bank .
In December 2007 , Paoletti was let go in a wave of layoffs that eventually shuttered the entire Syracuse operations center .
“ My job went to India , ” she sighs .
[ Economy1 ]
Soon after , she started collecting unemployment benefits and severance while searching for a job in earnest .
“ I apply for everything out there , ” she says , estimating she has applied to hundreds of positions over the past 30 months .
“ But 95 percent of the time , the company you send your resume to does not even acknowledge that they ’ve received it .
The majority of the time , if you do get an interview , they tell you that you are overqualified .
It seems like as soon as they find out your age , everything goes down after there .
The age discrimination is horrendous .
And everybody in that baby boomer age group is experiencing the same thing . ”
For 99 weeks , Paoletti accepted New York state and federal unemployment benefits .
This spring , they ran out .
Now , she is drawing down her IRA to stay afloat , underwater on her mortgage and without health insurance .
She ’s not alone .
Indeed , Paoletti is one of a million 99ers , as the long - term unemployed who have exceeded the maximum number of weeks of benefits are known .
The joblessness crisis — in the average duration of unemployment , if not the absolute unemployment rate — is unprecedented in the postwar United States .
Of the 15 million unemployed in America , over 7 million have been out of work for more than six months , nearly 5 million for a year and over 1 million for two years — the worst statistics since the government started keeping count in 1948 .
The proportion of the unemployed out of work for more than six months has doubled in the past year , to more than 46 percent .
The jobseekers - to - jobs ratio , which tells how hard positions are to get , remains around 5.6 to 1 .
Paoletti and other 99ers are afflicted by a constellation of problems .
Many are underwater on their mortgages , meaning they cannot sell their homes and move away .
Many are “ structurally unemployed , ” meaning that demand for their now - obsolete skills will not tick back up as the recession eases .
And many have deep ties to their communities , and cannot or will not move for another job .
For instance , Paoletti ’s father recently passed away after a battle with Alzheimer ’s ; she helped care for him until his death .
Her brother ( also unemployed for years now ) lives nearby , and her daughter — who moved home when she lost her job , and just found work decorating cakes part - time at a grocery store — lives with her .
The million 99ers like Paoletti do not just struggle with the immediate effects of joblessness — including , in many cases , the slide from the middle class into poverty .
They also struggle with the lingering deleterious effects .
The longer people are unemployed , the harder it is for them to regain a job .
Their skills deteriorate .
They tend to lose confidence , become depressed and suffer from higher rates of divorce and suicide .
Paoletti — and many experts — believe that only an expansion of emergency unemployment benefits or a similar intervention from Washington will save her and her cohort from abject poverty if employment does not rebound strongly , quickly .
But Washington does n’t seem motivated to fight for jobs — or for the 99ers .
The Senate is currently considering a $ 100 billion jobs package that might include new money to hire workers for highway repair and to preserve local - government hiring of teachers , as well as tax breaks for employers .
But none of the measures under consideration in the bill would keep the benefit checks coming in the mail for more than 99 weeks .
The senators from Paoletti’s home state — Democrats Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand — have both indicated they might be willing to extend unemployment benefits to 100 - plus weeks .
( This would create a fifth tier of unemployment benefits .
Tier IV , created by Congress last year , brought the maximum number of weeks of benefits to 99 in states with high unemployment rates . )
Schumer even wrote a letter that was published on the website of Paoletti ’s local newspaper , saying , “ Once I ensure that every New Yorker receives the full 99 weeks to which they are entitled , I will work with my colleagues to create a fifth tier of benefits .
More than 25,000 New Yorkers have exhausted the full 99 weeks of benefits and I am committed to providing them further relief . ”
But the Senate as a whole is less than willing .
Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , has indicated that he will not vote for a fifth tier , as have others .
“ You ca n’t go on forever .
I think 99 weeks is sufficient , ” Baucus told Bloomberg News .
Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) likewise dismissed the idea .
“ There ’s just been no discussion to go beyond [ 99 weeks ] , ” he said .
And the Senate leadership , without explicitly shooting down a fifth tier , has nodded in agreement .
Paoletti argues that Washington recognizes the enormity and seriousness of the problem but is turning its back on some of the nation ’s neediest .
The recalcitrance has led her to go activist .
She and some friends are currently lobbying for the final passage of the latest extenders bill , known in online communities for the 99ers as “ 4213 , ” its original bill number in the House .
It would not help people who have exhausted benefits , but would prevent the expiry of Tier IV extended benefits for hundreds of thousands of people a week .
Additionally , Paoletti and others meet up on listservs and websites , fax resumes to Washington and call congressional offices .
She hopes that a hearing on Thursday might prove the turning point for the 99ers .
Rep. Jim McDermott ( D - Wash . ) , the head of the subpanel on income security and family support for the House Ways and Means Committee , is holding the first hearing on policy responses for long - term unemployment .
“ Our first step to respond to long - term unemployment is obvious — continue the emergency federal unemployment programs to prevent millions of workers from losing their benefits , ” McDermott said in a statement .
“ If we can afford wars , tax cuts and bank bailouts , then we can certainly afford to maintain programs for workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own .
An increasing number of Americans who have worked hard and played by the rules are now finding themselves with no job , no savings and no support .
We must not abandon these workers and their families . ”
Paoletti hopes that the hearing — where letters from her and thousands others might be read into the record — will gin up pressure for Tier V .
Other solutions likely to be discussed are job retraining and emergency benefit programs .
But it all might be too little , too late for 99ers falling into poverty at a rate of thousands per week .
“ Out of all the people [ I know ] that got laid off the same time as me , I think only three have found jobs , ” Paoletti says .
“ The rest are still all have exhausted unemployment or they ’re getting close to the end of it .
Someone ’s got to do something . ”
( CNN ) --
A replica of a World Cup trophy seized by Colombian authorities at the Bogota airport was made of cocaine , police said .
Gold paint in " bad condition " on the trophy 's surface aroused the suspicion of investigators , who sent a sample of the trophy to a laboratory for forensic testing , the Colombian National Police said Saturday .
Results revealed that the replica was made of 24 pounds ( 11 kilograms ) of cocaine , police said .
The 14 - inch ( 36 centimeter ) replica was packed along with several team jerseys in a shipment headed to Madrid , Spain .
The real trophy , designed by Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga , is the same height , but is made of solid 18 - carat gold and weighs 13.6 pounds ( 6,175 grams ) .
It bears the engraved year and name of each World Cup winner since 1974 , according to FIFA , the international football federation .

Scuttlebutt News :
What ’s Really Wrong with Yacht Clubs
By Nicholas Hayes , Author of Saving Sailing
( April 23 , 2010 ) If I had to make a chart to represent hours of fun I ’ve had by originating location , it would show that a big slice of my fun begins at a yacht club .
So I generally like them a lot .
At the same time , I ’ll admit a personal bias towards the idea that yacht clubs should instead call themselves sailing clubs , and the sooner they do it , the better for sailing .
For me , it ’s not just about marketing : if I never see , smell , hear or feel a power boat again in my life , I ’ll be thrilled .
And I hate blazers and slacks .
But more than naming conventions and my pet - peeves , yacht clubs are generally in trouble , because their members are dying faster than they can find or make new ones .
They need to make a change .
I ’ve been studying the problem now for almost 20 years ; some of my research inspired the book Saving Sailing .
Yacht clubs have an age problem : member average age is usually around 60 .
Of course most clubs have junior programs as a feeder , but they usually do n’t feed .
I ’ve written extensively about how age segregation is part of the problem - it creates a broad chasm between young skilled , eager sailors , and the older , tiring base of a club .
Consider these observations , excerpted from the book :
“ In most sailing clubs today , the kids show up in the morning , and leave in the late afternoon , just about the time the adults are arriving ”
“ ... the decline in participation in sailing is better explained as a decline in devotion to intergenerational free - time pursuits . ”
It is hard to explain why it seems we ’ve gone to such lengths to create this gap -- separating the generations unnecessarily -- accept to suggest that :
1. ) it is a passive response to a general trend towards youth - sports and away from intergenerational activities everywhere , because youth - sports are easier to market , coordinate and scale , or ...
2. ) we ’ve come to depend on active , age - specific marketing for everything , and we ’re lacking the pop culture hero willing to twitter to inspire both 11 year olds and their moms to try sailing .
After all , marketing to parents means marketing to their kids , right ?
And then some new data hit my desk , suggesting that it has nothing to do with marketing at all .
We have it backwards .
Last month I was planning a Saving Sailing presentation at a 110 year old club , and working with a smart , relatively young ( 40 ’s ) member of the club ’s board of directors to ensure a relevant talk .
He suggested that in advance he would survey members to understand age , tenure , interests and value delivered .
As with most club surveys , his drew an adequate sample of his members , and it confirmed some common findings : average age , 60 - ish ; average time of service , 20 - ish years ; outgoing members outpacing incoming members .
It is easy to predict that this pace will quicken , and see tough times ahead .
Thus the talk .
On a hunch , I suggested , and he agreed , that instead of concentrating on turnover trends , we should find the mean age of club newcomers at the time of entry and chart it over the years .
And the cause of the age segregation gap popped into view , as did this club ’s chief challenge and some suggested solutions , which may be useful elsewhere .
For me , these data suggest a clear , new path to sustainability .
Notice that in 1960 , the average age of a new club member was 32 years old .
By 1993 , the average newcomer was over 60 , and the age has hovered around 55 ever since .
So during the heyday , when sailing was growing , its advocates were right in the middle of the years of active parenting .
They were bringing their kids .
And they were recruiting their friends who were often about the same age .
And they were bringing their kids .
Over the years , as the core group aged , the same advocates no longer had kids at home and their good efforts to introduce new friends resulted in newcomers of about the same age ( and also without kids . )
So clubs ( and sailing ) began to shrink when the typical club newcomer became an empty - nester or a retiree , and now sailing is no longer a sport enjoyed by families .
It ’s also telling that at this specific club , where today there is a strong commitment to a junior sailing program , there is only one member child in it .
The rest of the kids who participate arrive via schools or other youth clubs , or their non-member , non-sailing parents drop them off .
While there is no overall market statistical significance to these data , since this club ’s age demographics and member make - up are similar to those found in all of sailing in the US , it is safe to use the data anecdotally to make a point .
What ’s wrong with Yacht Clubs ?
Members aged , and as they did , they seemed to forget that they were once young .
One of the keys to Saving Sailing is that Yacht ( cough ) Sailing Clubs must re-open their doors to people in the active parenting years .
Of course , this has much broader implications and creates a new set of needs .
Most families do n’t have sailboats .
Often kids take to sailing earlier and more naturally than parents .
Families often have less disposable time than they had 40 years ago , or at least , their schedules are more complex .
It ’ll be hard to break the youth - sports habit .
Most clubs plan parties for adults , and day care for kids ( some just say no to kids altogether . )
The Sailing Club of the future will have found great solutions to these challenges .
And then it will be younger , and more vibrant , and more fun for everyone .

i Pad Data Plan Cost by Country
i Pad users in the United States are getting ripped off in how much they are paying for data on the device , says a company that has compared monthly data plans for the magical Apple device across different wireless carriers worldwide .
American users pay some of the highest prices in terms of dollars per gigabyte ( GB ) of data on the iPad , says Tableau Software , which created an amazing interactive chart ( above ) to show this .
Hong Kong and Singapore , which have the cheapest data rates for the iPad , have plans priced at less than one - twentieth the cost per gigabyte that U.S. users pay .
In the United States , AT&T is the exclusive data service provider for the iPad.
AT&T offers two options : 250 MB of data for $ 15 a month or 2 GB of data for $ 25 a month .
No contract is required for the plans .
The iPad data plan in U.K. costs a fifth of what consumers pay in the United States .
“ You can get a GB of data for 51 cents in Singapore , ” says Ross Perez , a data analyst at Tableau .
“ What ’s so special about the U.S. that we pay so much more ? ”
If it ’s any consolation , the United States does n’t rank as having the most expensive data plan for the iPad worldwide .
That honor goes to France , followed by Belgium and Luxembourg .
Mouse over the chart above and check out how much the highest and the lowest data plans cost in each country and which carriers offer the iPad .

Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. asked a simple question in their 2008 comic book ( and 2010 movie ) Kick - Ass :
Why do n't fanboys actually suit up and try their hand at being superheroes ?
As it turns out , a bunch of fanboys are in fact suiting up .
Hundreds of them .
Face front , true believer .
Cosplay is nothing new .
Its variant , Real Life Superheroes , are somewhat next - level .
Check out TheRLSH.net , a message board where aspiring supes – costumed adventurers who describe themselves as doing " humanitarian work " or otherwise generically helping those in distress – can discuss tradecraft , assemble into makeshift Avengers and escalate misunderstandings into internet brawls ahead of the inevitable team - up .
Seriously .
On this thread , for instance , a crimefighter called the Dark Ghost rallied his fellow champions of the innocent to find a seven - month old baby kidnapped in Tennessee .
Amazonia , the Minuteman , Gadgetastic and the Sparrow pledged support .
( As it turned out , the vigilante community did n't need to get involved , as law enforcement found young Drake Boyd 's abductor in Florida . )
Now , obviously these dudes do n't have superpowers .
But come on – neither does Batman .
So like Batman , what they lack in meta - human ability , they make up for in weaponry .
Take , for instance , a Brooklyn team called the New York Initiative , profiled this week in New York Press .
The four members of the Initiative –a reference to Tony Stark 's post - Civil War , pre-Secret Invasion efforts to put a superhero squad in each of the 50 states ?
– act like bodybuilders with a purpose .
And then they pack ( non-lethal ) heat .
Initiative member Z brandishes " giant ax handles bound with duck tape " and a cane that doubles as a club .
He 's also got – in reserve – a legally dubious arsenal that includes ninja throwing stars and what author Tea Krulos describes as " stun knuckles ( that make a loud zapping sound ) , throwing knives and spiky hand guards that look like something Genghis Khan would brawl in . "
A battle ax appears to be merely for display .
The team 's gadget whiz , who goes by the unfortunate name Victim , is testing out some polycarbonate squares for durability against knives .
Because being a hero means you 're going to get stabbed .
Factoring out the body armor , it appears to be a fairly cost - effective approach to adventuring .
Take Z's stun knuckles .
Zapping someone with 950,000 volts in the course of a single punch should run you around $ 50 .
Plus , that is , whatever legal costs you incur after your supervillain sues you .
Chances are your local municipality does n't look kindly on vigilantism , and less so on vigilantism armed with zappers .
What 's more , courts have n't been so keen on police use of non-lethal weapons like Tasers , and you 're sure not an officer of the law .
Speaking of the cops : According to Krulos 's piece , when the New York Initiative asks the police if they can set up a patrol by downtown Brooklyn's Fulton Mall , a member of New York 's finest tells them , " Naw , fuhgetabout that .
You ’ll get shot .
The guys in this neighborhood , they ’ll shoot you and no one will tell us who did it .
There ’s a strong ' no snitching ' rule out here . "
We know that in the comics as honor among thieves .
So , be careful out there , champions of right : Come strapped and stay on the right side of the law .

The problem with showing a collection on professional male and female models made up to look yellow in the face and bald with thin scraps of facial hair is that it detracts completely from the clothes .
Who cares what a chick ’s boxer shorts look like when she is topless and molting a beard , like a long - lost would - be Coneheads character , if only she had the full cone ?
But this is what designer Patrick Mohr ’s hair and makeup looked like in his show at Berlin Fashion Week today .
The images are startling and disturbing , but the show may have gotten the most attention of any at this Berlin Fashion Week .
The event is n’t as big as Paris , Milan , New York , or even London Fashion Weeks , but designers are known to take more risks , The Wall Street Journal notes .
Mohr ’s show is just one example of that , along with further proof that unkempt beards are happening .
Or maybe this is a comment on some sort of hot new German reverse hormone therapy !

Perhaps you have seen or heard a little bit about Lebron James leaving his current team and signing with two other famous players in Miami .
It was a fairly understated and subtle affair , so if you missed it that 's quite understandable .
To get you caught up , James was a free agent and kept everyone guessing up until the last moment as to whether he would stay with his hometown team , The Cleveland Cavaliers , or leave for any number of other teams ;
The New York Knicks , The Los Angeles Clippers , The Miami Heat or The New Jersey Nets .
Teams had been planning for James ' free agency for two even three years , saving money and dumping contracts so they'd have a shot at the star player .
Free agency is a pretty standard aspect of modern professional sports .
What was not standard was James sending out misinformation and then launching a one - hour special dedicated only to announce this decision .
The special show that aired on ESPN on Thursday was even called The Decision , smacking of the over - hyped ridiculous self - importance that is all too prevalent in sports .
It was anything but classy .
Most astute fans knew that Lebron was going to face scrutiny after the show no matter what he decided .
By making a spectacle of the announcement he was causing undue problems for himself .
Kurt Helin of Pro Basketball
Talk said it best , " He either ends up on national television to break Cleveland 's heart , or he has an hour - long special on himself to say he is going nowhere .
Both options have public relations problems to deal with . "

What is not being talked about is the effect on Nike .
More specifically : Lebron James has been
Nike basketball for years now , somewhat taking Jordan 's place as the brand 's icon .
Since Lebron is leaving Cleveland for Miami , there is also the appearance that Nike is leaving Cleveland .
All those images of Cleveland fans burning James ' shoes and jerseys and posters and t- shirts are also images of fans burning Nike 's brand .
How can the discontent of millions of midwestern basketball fans not spill over onto the most visible part of Lebron James ' persona , that of Nike spokesperson ?
Lebron has abandoned Cleveland and Nike may have as well .
At least that is the common perspective on things .
When I saw the image of the We Are All Witnesses Nike billbaord featuring # 23 being torn down on ESPN this morning , it became pretty clear that Nike 's presence in Cleveland is being torn down as well .
The fact that there has been so much backlash for how The Decision ( sic ) was handled , means that the actions of the sponsored has dirtied that of sponsor simply by association .
I 'm surprised someone in Nike 's camp did n't throw themselves in front of this dumb idea for a show and prevent such bad publicity .
Now they are facing the same public ire that the player is - after all , Nike was the lens through which most fans experienced James .
Yes , we all witnessed what happened this week and are feeling pretty ugly about it .
As a matter of fact the We Are All Witnesses campaign has become a point of parody for fans to communicate their disgust .
Chants of Witness Disloyalty or Witness A Traitor can probably be heard today ringing down not just the streets of Cleveland but throughout a lot of other B - level cities in America .
Source : AP Photo / The Plain Dealer , Marvin Fong
So what is Nike to do ?
Do they sponsor another player that comes to Cleveland and try to fill that gap ?
That would be next to impossible as James cast a pretty large shadow especially since the town felt like they had raised James since high school .
Does
Nike just lay low and let this story die down ?
I feel like that is giving an opportunity to other marketers to do some timely marketing of their own .
Were I Adidas or Reebok ( heck And 1 or Under Armor ) I would take this chance and respond in some way using clever advertising and try to endear fans ( not just in Cleveland ) to their brand instead .
Although I do look forward to the future design around his new number six .
Maybe Nike works with Lebron and does something classy , publicly thanking Cleveland fans for all that they 've done for him over the years ?
There is a big risk of that feeling insincere , especially while Bosh , Wade and James sign contacts and dance gleefully in front of the Miami fans and a worldwide audience - which has been going on for the last two days as of this article 's writing .
As Rob Shuster said in ESPN's Bill Simmons ' latest mailbag article : " ( What Lebron did is ) Like dangling an engagement ring in front of your longtime girlfriend , then getting on your knee at the bar and proposing to a girl you met last week .
( We 're ) Completely destroyed . "
All of this sponsored by Nike albeit indirectly .
We 've seen the risks of focusing one 's brand on a single player 's persona .
If that player runs into trouble with the law , your brand looks bad .
If it turns out that the player has a little trouble staying faithful to his wife , your brand is aligned with that .
And if your star decides to stick a knife in the back of an entire region of the country in the most visible manner possible , your brand is aligned with that too .
I will argue that the last scenario is by far the stickiest because it is oddly somehow less forgivable .
Some will say that Lebron James is a symbol for all that is wrong with sports .
Sport is now about money and economy over fans and loyalty .
It 's about long - term lucrative contracts over only slightly less long and barely less lucrative contracts .
It 's more about business and less about the game .
And guess who some people are going to blame for this ?
The big time advertisers and Nike in this particular instance .
They will be seen as part of the problem in sports and ironically that 's really bad business for the brand .
Will Anyone in Cleveland buy a pair of Nikes again at least without wincing like an abused dog ?
Yes Lebron James left Cleveland .
And he took Nike with him .
Now what ?
This is a question I 'm betting is being tossed around the halls of agency Wieden + Kennedy and in Beaverton , Oregon where Nike is headquartered .
Root Beer Float Cupcakes
Cake adapted from Baked : New Frontiers in Baking
A root beer float is a tall glass of root beer with a scoop of vanilla ice cream inside .
I tried to turn this into a cupcake a few ways , first with a plain whipped cream frosting ( hoping the cream could stand in for ice cream ) and then with both whipped cream and a tiny , nested scoop of ice cream .
Both are delicious .
Neither are particularly portable .
The whipped cream is good for two hours at room temperature but the ice cream , only a few minutes .
If you ’re bringing them somewhere else , I suggest bringing the ice cream and / or whipped cream separately and assembling them on the spot ; get others involved , I am sure it could be fun .
You could also swap out both toppings for a more traditional , stable frosting such as a Quick Buttercream or a Seven Minute Frosting ( my vote , because it tastes like marshmallows ) .
I also want to note that while the root beer flavor is present in the cakes , it ’s not the loudest root beer flavor ( unsurprising as most root beers today are pretty subtle ) .
One way to make it more pronounced , as suggested in Baked , is to swap out half a cup of root beer for root beer schnapps , which looks like it is available from a few places online .
Cupcakes
2 cups root beer ( I used Boylan because it was easy to find and made with cane sugar )
1 cup dark unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup ( 1 stick or 4 ounces ) unsalted butter , cut into 1 - inch pieces
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
2 cups all - purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
Toppings
1 1/2 cups heavy or whipping cream
3 tablespoons powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pint of vanilla ice cream ( you ’ll have leftover ; you ’re welcome )
Maraschino cherries ( optional )
Make the root beer cupcakes : Preheat oven to 350 °F .
Line 22 cupcake cups with paper liners .
In a small saucepan , heat the root beer , cocoa powder and butter over medium heat until the butter is melted .
Add the sugars and whisk until dissolved .
Remove from heat and let cool .
In a large bowl , whisk flour , baking soda , and salt together .
In a small bowl , whisk the eggs until just beaten then whisk them into the cooled cocoa mixture until combined .
Fold the liquid and flour mixtures together in the large bowl .
The batter will be slightly lumpy ; this is okay .
If you overbeat it , it will get tough .
Fill cupcake liners about 2/3 to 3/4 full ( a 1/4 cup scoop or measuring cup will filled mine perfectly ) and bake cupcakes , rotating trays back to front and top to bottom halfway through , until a tester inserted into the center of each comes out clean , about 17 minutes .
Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool completely .
Assemble cupcakes :
Whip heavy or whipping cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until it holds soft peaks .
You can do this with an electric mixer , but if you do it by hand , not only will you get a killer arm workout ( which you can trade in for a cupcake , very soon ) , it will be nearly impossible to overbeat the cream .
( Which I almost always do with a mixer . )
Use the tip of a knife to cut a small cone of cake out of the top center of each cupcake ; feel free to snack on these , I wo n’t tell anyone .
Using a spoon or a small cookie scoop , nest a scoop of ice cream in each indent .
Surround ice cream with dollops of whipped cream .
Top with a cherry , if using .
To keep cupcakes in a holding pattern while you assemble the remaining ones , you can put them in the freezer , but try to do so for no more than 5 minutes or the whipped cream will harden .
Eat immediately .
More excessive detail :
The brown paper cupcake liners are from New York Cake and Baking Supply on 22nd Street .
They ’re also available from many stores online ( please do a simple search ; I would prefer that the comment section is not filled with links to suppliers ) .
I used a medium round piping tip to make the whipped cream dollops ( the size escapes me ) but a plastic bag with the corner snipped off will do almost the same job .
I used a # 70 scoop for the ice cream ( about 1 tablespoon ) but your 1 tablespoon measuring spoon would do about the same .

Today I found out UPS was started by two teenagers with one bicycle and $ 100 borrowed from a friend .
The date was August 28 , 1907 and the two kids were 18 year old Claude Ryan and 19 year old Jim Casey .
The two had one bike between them and $ 100 ( about $ 2400 today ) borrowed from a friend to found the “ American Messenger Company ” in Seattle , Washington .
The company was initially run in a hotel basement at Second Avenue and Main Street in Seattle .
At that time , most people did n’t own phones , so sending telegrams was a frequent thing .
These had to be hand delivered .
In the beginning , the company primarily delivered these telegrams , but eventually expanded into transporting pretty much anything that could be transported on a bicycle or on foot .
Casey and Ryan manned the phone while Casey ’s brother George and a handful of other teenagers went out making deliveries .
Fast - forward a few years and Casey and Ryan had merged their company with rival Merchant ’s Parcel Delivery taking the latter ’s name .
In the process , they acquired a few motorcycles and delivery cars with their first car being a Ford Model T .
At this time , more and more people had telephones so Casey and Ryan switched to working with retail stores to deliver customers purchases to their homes .
By the time Casey retired from UPS in 1962 , the company had grown to operating in 31 U.S. states with annual revenue around $ 550 million and about 22,000 workers .
Fast forward to 2013 and Casey and Ryan ’s company that started so humbly is now worth approximately $ 80 billion with annual revenue at over $ 50 billion ; employing just under half a million workers in 200 countries ; delivering over 3.8 billion packages and documents a year .
Amazing what $ 100 , some elbow grease , and a bit of ingenuity can do .

Bonus Facts :
Returning to their roots , in 2008 , UPS began hiring bike delivery workers in Vancouver , Washington and various cities in Oregon .
UPS developed software that routes trucks such that they minimize left turns in their deliveries .
By doing so , they reduced their annual fuel consumption by nearly 51,000 gallons in Washington DC alone .
The reduction in fuel comes from drivers not having to sit idling at red lights waiting to make left hand turns .
When UPS expanded into West Germany , they had to change the brown uniform to green , due to the “ brown shirts ” worn by the Nazi SA .
In the early days of UPS , the United States Postal Service was their biggest client .
UPS handled delivering all USPS special delivery mail in Seattle .
UPS uses its own font , UPS Sans , which is a slightly altered FF Dax .
The brown color UPS uses is named Pullman Brown .
James
Casey originally wanted the trucks to be yellow , instead of brown .
He was eventually convinced to make them brown by Charlie Soderstrom .
Soderstrom pointed out that yellow trucks would be impossible to keep clean .
Railroad cars are often brown for this same reason .
In 1966 , Jim Casey created the Casey Family Programs to help children who are unable to live with their birth parents .
Casey felt his family life was critical to his being able to become successful .
As such , the goal of the organization is to attempt to provide the same type of stability and support base to these children .
In 1919 , Merchant ’s Parcel Delivery changed its name to the United Postal Service .
At this same time , the company began expanding to other cities besides just Seattle .
The name was chosen with “ United ” signifying that each of the offices in various cities were all part of a greater whole ; “ Parcel ” identified the nature of the business ; and “ Service ” indicating what was offered .

For many participants the condition of the city was shocking – abandoned houses and neighborhoods , empty lots filled with weeds and trash , shuttered plants that at one time employed tens of thousands , roads in disrepair , homeless and hungry people living on the edge of the city ’s downtown , and more .
Detroit ’s population loss has been so massive , probably unprecedented for a major urban center , that the new mayor speaks of shrinking the city by a third – a third less space , a third less services , a third less houses , a third less schools , a third less people !
A tough and mind - boggling reality for sure !
Enough to get you down , enough to make you despair .
But this was n’t the mood among the Detroiters attending the forum .
Their stories – and I was n’t at all surprised for this city ’s people are , if nothing else , resilient – spoke not of despair , but of hope and struggle , of reclaiming , redesigning , and reconfiguring the city , of the people ’s right to a livable city .
If big capital ( in particular what used to be called the Big Three auto corporations ) left an undeniable imprint on the city ’s development and patterns of living and working in the past century , a new generation of Detroiters is determined to impress its stamp on their city in this century .
No shrinking violets , they are turning a deep urban crisis into an opportunity to reinvent the city as a truly human space – a new mix of green industries , new forms of property ownership and public regulation , new modes of public transportation , new webs of ecological diversity , including urban farms and open space , new cultural and aesthetic sensibilities , a new enlargement of the public square and commons , and new forms of human interactions .
This spirit and vision , forged in what is both an immediate and longer - term crisis , could n’t help but inspire all of us at the Social Forum .
At the core of Detroit ’s crisis was the redeployment of capital to other regions and countries , the massive withdrawal of federal support for urban development , the shift of the U.S. economy ’s center of gravity from industry to finance , and a sustained and savage attack against the city ’s multi-racial working class and its African American majority .
Detroit ’s future , therefore , hangs on reversing these processes .
The flow of both public and private capital has to be redirected back to the city , where it can combine with a skilled labor force and new democratic forms of ownership and regulation to produce new products and ways of working .
A renewed commitment by the federal government to address the decline of urban America is imperative .
Manufacturing ( in sustainable forms ) must be re-centered at the core of the economy .
And the power of the right and finance capital still has to be crushed by a broad anti-racist labor - led people ’s movement on a national and local level .
Detroiters have a rich deposit of political , economic and cultural experience , but they ca n’t do it alone .
Self - organization , visionary urban planning , and bottom - up people ’s actions are dialectically connected to a further shift in the balance of class power in a progressive direction at the national and state level .
That may sound obvious , but I mention it because I heard appeals from some prominent people on Detroit ’s left for self - reliance and a bootstrap developmental model .
But is that much better than the mayor ’s plan to shrink the city ?
Yes , but not by too much .
Detroit needs allies as well as financial resources .
Corporate capital and the federal government should not be left off the hook .
After all , the lion ’s share of corporate profits and federal tax revenues come from working people .
Which side wins in this depends on which side – the corporations and their bidders or the working class , the racially oppressed , and their allies – holds the predominance of power .
At this moment that question is n’t settled , but if the spirit of Detroiters and the activists at the U.S. Social Forum begin to permeate the nation , Detroit and many other centers of the working class will rise like a phoenix out of the ashes , in new plumage , and reclaim their place of glory in the American landscape .

According to security researcher Craig Heffner , about half the existing models of home routers , including most Linksys , Dell , and Verizon , are vulnerable to being hacked .
The hack relies on tricking people to visit a malicious website .
From that point on , the router itself can be hijacked and the poor user redirected pretty much anywhere the hacker wants them to go .
The hack relies on a hack known as " DNS rebinding , " something that has been around for nearly 15 years :
The hack exploits an element of the Domain Name System , or DNS , the Internet 's method of converting Web page names into IP address numbers .
( When you visit Google.com , for instance , a domain name server might convert that name into the IP address 72.14.204.147 . )
Modern browsers have safeguards that prevent sites from accessing any information that 's not at their registered IP address .
But a site can have multiple IP addresses , a flexibility in the system designed to let sites balance traffic among multiple servers or provide backup options .
Heffner 's trick is to create a site that lists a visitor 's own IP address as one of those options .
When a visitor comes to his booby - trapped site , a script runs that switches its alternate IP address -- in reality the user 's own IP address -- and accesses the visitor 's home network , potentially hijacking their browser and gaining access to their router settings .
Heffner has tested 30 routers and found about half of them to be vulnerable , through a combination of either a software flaw or a weak settings password .
Think you 're safe because you use OpenDNS or Firefox NoScript plug - in ?
Think again !
According to Heffner , this does n't offer any protection .
So , what to do if your router is vulnerable ?
Well , check for updates , but if they 're not forthcoming , buy a new one .
Oh , and change those default passwords , every hackers knows them !
One of the most well - known lines in John Maynard Keynes ’ General
Theory notes how politicians think of themselves as reacting to “ events ” when they are in fact “ usually the slaves of some defunct economist . ”
The latest G - 20 meeting , held last month in Toronto , proves Keynes ’ wisdom once again -- with a twist .
The G - 20 meeting ended with a collective endorsement of “ growth - friendly fiscal consolidation , ” which assumes that if G - 20 member states tighten their fiscal belts , states will have to borrow less , pay less interest , and , therefore , will not “ crowd - out ” private - sector growth .
Such a strategy may sound sensible , but it relies on the same fallacy of composition that brought on the banking crisis -- that by making individual banks safe , you make the system as a whole safe -- only in reverse .
That is , although it may make sense for any single state ( or firm or household ) to clean its balance sheet , if all the G - 20 states embark on such a course at once , the results could be disastrous .
The whole -- Keynes ’ critical insight -- is not equivalent to the sum of its parts .
The finance ministers of the G - 20 states seem to believe that by retrenching in the middle of a recession , they will somehow improve their states ’ balance sheets and thus return to a period of economic growth .
Deflation , in other words , is now good for growth .
How did we get here ?
Less than two years ago , the world ’s financial institutions pleaded for a taxpayer - funded bailout of the global financial system , arguing that allowing the largest banks and most globalized firms to fail would lead to a prolonged depression .
They got what they wanted : according to the IMF , the 34 states that it classifies as “ advanced economies ” spent approximately 55 percent of their respective GDPs on capital injections , liability guarantees , and outright purchases of bad assets from the major banks .
Although these dramatic measures may have been distasteful to some , they seem to have worked .
The global economy avoided a second Great Depression .
Between March 2009 , when markets began to rebound , and the present day , average global asset prices have rebounded and the appetite of institutional investors for economic risk has steadily grown .
But even the most Herculean efforts of finance ministers and central bankers could not prevent the financial - market contagion from spilling over into the real economy .
Credit tightened , investment fell , and unemployment rose across the world .
Here , too , policymakers had a response .
Nearly every advanced industrialized country in the world embarked on a policy of Keynesian stimulus to buoy their national economies against prolonged recession and deflation .
As Robert Skidelsky , the British economic historian , has put it , “ the Master ” has returned , pushing aside many of the fiscally conservative tenets of the Washington consensus , which drove IMF and World Bank policy on economic crises for decades .
There was a cost to this Keynesian victory , however .
Government finances suffered , with fiscal deficits soaring across Europe and North America .
As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff recently found , this should not have come as a surprise , since banking crises are almost always followed by sovereign debt crises , or at least prolonged periods of fiscal stress and lost output .
When the private - sector firms clean up their balance sheets by reducing debt and stockpiling cash , the public sector takes on debt , partly through automatic stabilizers such as unemployment benefits and partly through discretionary spending , including fiscal - stimulus projects .
Now , with the real economy suffering , the taxpayer is saving and reducing debt rather than spending , resulting in increasing deficits and fiscal stress on the public side of the ledger .
The global financial crisis has thus taken an ironic turn .
The same large multinational financial firms that sought government bailouts are now shocked and surprised by the spending of “ profligate ” governments .
Indeed , these actors are now speculating against the very governments who brought them back to life by shorting their debt .
As a consequence , governments across Europe are adopting austerity measures to outflank the positions of these speculators .
Academic commentators such as N. Gregory Mankiw and Jeffrey Sachs are championing these moves , and both have called for the G - 20 to focus on balancing budgets and on “ pro-growth ” austerity .
They point to persistently high unemployment and stagnant output as proof of the failure of current policies .
Similarly , former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan recently declared that the lack of a rise in the cost of servicing long - term U.S. debt is “ regrettable , ” since “ it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences . ”
But does the blame for persistent unemployment and bloated government finances indeed lie with politicians who fell for Keynesian proscriptions ?
And , more fundamentally , are austerity policies the right course for the G - 20 states ?
First , in order to say that the global stimulus policy has failed , it is necessary to consider the counterfactual of no fiscal stimulus at all .
There is already a natural experiment of this case : the countries of Eastern Europe that decided not to inject large amounts of liquidity into their national economies .
For example , in May 2009 , as the United States and Western European countries were consciously expanding public deficits , Latvian President Valdis Zatlers set his government on course for “ severe budget stabilization measures ” and several “ structural reforms , ” many of which resemble what the G20 is wishing upon itself today .
Yet Latvian GDP fell more than 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 , while unemployment grew to more than 16 percent , and government finances -- the theoretical beneficiary of all this belt - tightening -- collapsed because of falling tax revenue .
These results were replicated from Estonia to Romania with even worse results , suggesting that the G - 20 member states should perhaps be careful what they wish for .
Second , financial markets are social phenomena , which means that economic performance is as much determined by market participants ’ beliefs as it is by fundamental indicators or textbook policy .
In the parlance of technical traders , prices can move on “ momentum , ” whereby disequilibrating price movements compound one other , further driving market prices away from their true worth -- a dynamic that is visible in sovereign debt markets today .
Imagine , for example , a case in which a number of creditors believe that a certain state is likely to become insolvent in the next few months .
The state ’s creditors would demand more collateral , or yield , for holding the debt , thereby worsening the cash position of the state .
Eventually , the pressure from speculators would cause the state to run out of cash , thereby creating the very situation that investors feared -- but from which they would also profit through the short selling of bonds .
Such a scenario feels eerily like 1991 , when George Soros famously made $ 1 billion in profit by short selling the British pound .
And just like in 1991 , central banks are following the wrong lesson : rather than calling speculators on their positions , European governments appear to have caved to the pressure and favor austerity over demand management .
It is likely that France , Germany , and the United Kingdom will move to cut their deficits dramatically , which will lead to a rise in eurozone unemployment , a decrease in the purchase of U.S. exports , and a faltering of global economic recovery .
Falling economic growth in the G - 20 states will further lower consumption and increase unemployment .
Meanwhile , the financial sector will see its equity holdings shrink and its balance sheets worsen once again .
Such a scenario makes it quite possible that these same financial institutions will argue that the stimulus was not big enough and should be tried again -- but now from a more leveraged position .
To see a glimpse of such a future , look at Japan : seesawing between spending and retrenchment cost Japan 15 years of growth and employment between 1990 and 2005 , when Japan ’s economic policymakers were swayed by exactly the same sort of arguments that are ascendant in the G - 20 today .
There is no silver bullet to avoid the macroeconomic fallout associated with financial crises .
The question , then , is where ( and by whom ) this pain will be felt .
So far , it appears that although the financial sector was largely responsible for creating the $ 2 trillion in losses since the crisis began , it is determined to avoid paying for it .
Instead , the taxpayers that paid to bail these firms out are now being doubly taxed as government services are cut in the name of “ growth - friendly fiscal consolidation , ” in the words of the G - 20 .
What lies ahead , then , is a harmful populism that allies U.S. Tea Party activists with Greek public - sector unions .
In sum , both of the following statements are true : countercyclical spending worsens government finances , and austerity compounds an already miserable unemployment situation .
But cutting spending in the middle of a recession is no solution -- especially when market participants conflate stimulus spending with bailouts of the financial system .
Refilling a $ 2 trillion hole in the global financial architecture does not have the same effect on demand as , say , a $ 2 trillion stimulus package spent on brick - and - mortar projects .
Such a conflation damns fiscal stimulus to ineffectiveness -- even though a large portion of the stimulus is yet to be spent in the United States and abroad and almost all of the debt accrued since the crisis comes from tax - revenue losses and bailout costs .
It is a shame that many of the most powerful ideas of dead economists are the most fallacious .
The Great Depression proved that supply does not create its own demand .
The mortgage debacle showed that good and bad money can co-exist quite happily .
Although the idea of “ austerity ” may have the immediate ring of virtue , in the long term it is a vice .
Keynes was indeed right , but with a twist .
It is not the ideas of dead economists we have to worry about , but rather the dead ideas of very much alive ones .
France 's chaotic World Cup campaign descended towards a full - scale player revolt this afternoon after the players refused to train in a show of support for the exiled Nicolas Anelka , prompting the national team director , Jean - Louis Valentin , to quit in disgust .
The team arrived at training today but a few minutes after taking the field the fitness coach , Robert Duverne , stormed away , throwing his accreditation badge to the ground , apparently after an argument with the team captain , Patrice Evra .
The players then left the training ground and boarded the team bus , in which they had a meeting with Raymond Domenech behind closed curtains .
The France squad then released a statement which read : " All players in the France squad without exception want to declare their opposition to the decision taken by the French Football Federation to exclude Nicolas Anelka from the squad .
" If we regret the incident which occurred at half - time of the match between France and Mexico , we regret even more the leak of an event which should have remained within the group and which is quite common in a high - level team .
" At the request of the squad the player in question attempted to have dialogue but his approach was ignored .
For its part the French Football Federation has at no time tried to protect the squad .
It has made a decision [ to send Anelka home ] without consulting all the players , on the basis of the facts reported by the press .
" Accordingly , and to mark the opposition to those at the highest level of French football , all the players decided not to train today .
Out of respect for the public who came to attend training , we decided to go to meet the fans who , by their presence , showed their full support .
For our part we are aware of our responsibilities as those wearing the colours of our country ; also for those we have towards our fans and countless children who keep Les Bleus as role models .
" We forget none of our duties .
We will do everything individually and also in a collective spirit to ensure that France regains its honour with a positive performance on Tuesday . "
The statement was read out by Domenech and comes after the squad refused to train .
Valentin announced his resignation after revealing that the squad did not want to train .
" Ask the players , they do not want to involve themselves any more .
It 's unacceptable , " Valentin said .
" They do n't want to train .
It 's a scandal for the French , it 's a scandal for the federation and the French team .
It is a shame .
As for me , it 's over .
I 'm leaving the federation .
I 'm sickened and disgusted .
Under these conditions I 've decided to return to Paris and to resign . "
The French team is in disarray after Anelka was sent home after reports of a foul - mouthed tirade at Domenech , whose tactics and management skills have been called into question .
Domenech justified the decision to send Anelka home , saying the striker had refused to apologise for the outburst .

Prosecutor 's fallacy Wikipedia has an article about
The fallacy of singling out a particular hypothesis for attention when there is insufficient evidence already in hand to justify such special attention .
To see the problem of privileging the hypothesis , suppose that the police in Largeville , a town with a million inhabitants , are investigating a murder in which there are few or no clues - the victim was stabbed to death in an alley , and there are no fingerprints and no witnesses .
Then , one of the detectives says , " Well ... we have no idea who did it ... no particular evidence singling out any of the million people in this city ... but let 's consider the possibility that this murder was committed by Mortimer Q. Snodgrass , who lives at 128 Ordinary Ln . "
If the detective does not have evidence already in hand to justify singling out Mortimer for such special and individual attention , then this is , or ought to be , a violation of Mortimer 's civil rights .
This is true even if the detective is not claiming that Mortimer did do it , but only suggesting that all the police officers consider that Mortimer might have done it .
The principle of locating the hypothesis says that it often takes more evidence to first distinguish the true hypothesis as worthy of explicit consideration , than to distinguish among the remaining alternatives .
So the detective is jumping over the job of providing most of the evidence that would have to be brought against Mortimer .
" Privileging the hypothesis " is the fallacy committed by a creationist who points out a purported flaw in standard evolutionary theory , and brings forward the Trinity to fill the gap - rather than a billion other deities or a trillion other naturalistic hypotheses .
Actually , without evidence already in hand that points to the Trinity specifically , one cannot justify raising that particular hypothesis to explicit attention rather than a trillion others .
The anti-work of anti-epistemology is to manufacture belief without evidence , and in large answer spaces , attention without evidence is more than halfway to belief without evidence .
Someone who spends all day pondering whether the Trinity does or does not exist - rather than Allah , Thor , or the Flying Spaghetti Monster - is more than halfway converted to Christianity .

The Cameron gamble , bewitched by the success of Tony Blair , was to take this even further , to the point where , on most of the major issues confronting the country , his position has been virtually indistinguishable from that of the other main parties .
To see where this has left us , one has only to imagine what might have happened last week had we had a Tory leader more like a reincarnation of Mrs Thatcher , exposing the destructive emptiness of almost everything the New Labour project stood for : on the bloated powers and intrusions of bureaucracy , on Europe , on immigration , on defence , on our delusional energy policy , and above all on by far the most serious issue confronting Britain today , that unprecedented public spending deficit which will soon force us to cut back the public sector on a scale no party dared mention in their irrelevant election campaigns .
BP is a class act all around .
When they ’re not destroying the global environment , they ’re strong - arming governments to release terrorists found guilty of murdering innocent civilians .
And to think these executives are supposed to be part of respectable society .
Even worse , our governments let them call the shots so often including in the Gulf of Mexico .
Senator Schumer deserves credit for asking BP to immediately back away from their $ 900 million Libyan investment .
The oil giant BP faced a new furor on Thursday as it confirmed that it had lobbied the British government to conclude a prisoner - transfer agreement that the Libyan government wanted to secure the release of the only person ever convicted for the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing over Scotland , which killed 270 people , most of them Americans .
The admission came after American legislators , grappling with the controversy over the company ’s disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil spill , called for an investigation into BP ’s actions in the case of the freed man , Abdel Basset Ali al - Megrahi .
The former Libyan intelligence agent was released and allowed to return to Libya last August after doctors advised the Scottish government that he was likely to die within three months of advanced prostate cancer .
But nearly a year later , he remains alive , and free , in the Libyan capital , Tripoli .
While much of the country remains fixated on the bleak employment picture , hiring is beginning to pick up in the place that led the economy into recession  Wall Street .
The shift underscores the remarkable recovery of the biggest banks and brokerage firms since Washington rescued them in the fall of 2008 , and follows the huge rebound in profits for members of the New York Stock Exchange , which totaled $ 61.4 billion in 2009 , the most ever .
Since employment bottomed out in February , New York securities firms have added nearly 2,000 jobs , a trend that is also playing out nationwide at financial companies , commodity contract traders and investment firms .
Though the figures are small in comparison to overall Wall Street employment , executives , economists and headhunters say they expect the growth to pick up steam in the coming months .
“ I think we ’re seeing some hiring in anticipation of better times , ” said Rae Rosen , a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
“ Wall Street typically hires in anticipation of the recovery , and there is a sense that the economy has bottomed out and is slowly improving . ”

An update on the state of the sea ice is in order .
After beginning my usual boring sea ice post , I ran across the NSIDC news story on sea ice .
You know the unbiased scientific review of the conditions of sea ice globally .
I ’m pissed off now that they would post this kind of rubbish .
Previously , I ’ve been complimentary of the NSIDC , but this story is way over the top .
It reads like a Joe Romm post more than a scientific one .
It ’s a prayer to the gods of AGW , a worship at the altar of funding and a blatant attempt to leave layman ’s heads full of global warming cobwebs .
I ’ll leave the Jaxa graph up below and the first three graphs including the original wording here .
This was written before I read the NSIDC article so think of it as a reminder of how unexciting sea ice updates usually are .
Jaxa has the Arctic ice anomaly over the last several months lower than the last 8 years .
From the cryosphere page using the NSIDC data .
I ’ve replicated this plot enough times here that I do n’t worry much about it anymore .
This June was actually the second lowest arctic ice extent anomaly on record and we ’re told from the NSIDC that it was the lowest June ever measured .
The NSIDC did n’t post any other months on their main page but conveniently allowed selection of the Antarctic June months on the same link .
It seems we have a record June in the Antarctic as well .
What is amazing is the story that the NSIDC told .
I do n’t know who writes for the NSIDC , but the bias is incredible .
Not only do they fail to recognize the record HIGH ice in the Antarctic they do everything to cover it up from laymen .
They do n’t even mention the Antarctic except for three small paragraphs at the bottom of a long dry discussion of Arctic ice loss and weather .
After declaring one record ice loss after another for the Arctic they say :
At the end of June , Southern Hemisphere mid-winter , the sea ice surrounding Antarctica was more than two standard deviations greater than normal .
On June 30 , Antarctic sea ice extent was 15.88 million square kilometers ( 6.13 million square miles ) , compared to the 1979 to 2000 average of 14.64 million square kilometers ( 5.65 million square miles ) for that day .
While recent studies have shown that wintertime Antarctic sea ice has a weak upward trend , and substantial variability both within a year and from year to year , the differences between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice trends are not unexpected
Compare that too :
Rapid ice loss continues through June Average June ice extent was the lowest in the satellite data record , from 1979 to 2010 .
Arctic air temperatures were higher than normal , and Arctic sea ice continued to decline at a fast pace .
June saw the return of the Arctic dipole anomaly , an atmospheric pressure pattern that contributed to the record sea ice loss in 2007 .
and
In June , ice extent declined by 88,000 square kilometers ( 34,000 square miles ) per day , more than 50 % greater than the average rate of 53,000 square kilometers ( 20,000 square miles ) per day .
This rate of decline is the fastest measured for June .
and
At the end of May 2010 , daily ice extent fell below the previous record low for May , recorded in 2006 , and during June continued to track at record low levels .
By the 30th of June , the extent was 510,000 square kilometers ( 197,000 square miles ) below the same day in 2006 .
In fact RECORD was used eleven times in describing the Arctic sea ice loss .
Whereas the June record HIGH in the Antarctic got not one mention .
Instead we got a lecture about greenhouse gasses , models and unsubstantiated bullcrap about the ozone layer , and it is unsubstantiated .
In reality , the scientists do n’t know what causes Antarctic sea ice to rise .
Despite the fact that nobody predicted the increase they write –IT WAS NOT UNEXPECTED .
Ever hear the politician joke with a little twist ?
How do you know when a climatologist is not telling the truth ? —-
Remember this is the area where the Wilkens sea ice shelf dies every year .
Every year we hear how global warming will continue the breakup of the Antarctic ice , and lately , despite the god - like hubris of the climatology community , the true god of physics in fact refuses to listen .
Maybe they are praying to the wrong god ?
Maybe they need bigger computers ?
The link to the special NSIDC Sea Ice NEWS AND ANALYSIS is here :
As everyone knows , biased and blatantly dishonest scientists do n’t get good treatment here .
Well if you ca n’t get the truth from the NSIDC where can you get it ?
Right here my friends , from the uncompensated aeronautical engineering department of the Air Vent , where climate science conclusions are rendered after looking at the data , and NOT according to the best path to funding and prestige .
And even less - so than by computer models projecting hundreds of years in the future .
Antarctic ice extent from the Cryosphere , which seems to be far less dedicated to biasing the interpretation of data than the NSIDC .
At least on the main page .
Although they also prefer to show declining seasonal Arctic graphs at the top without the corresponding rising Antarctic ones .
The plot shows Antarctic sea ice peaked at the third highest level on record this year and continues to buck the EXPECTED trend predicted by global warming politicians .
From the global sea ice plot atUIUC Cryosphere global sea ice was slightly above the average level a couple of months ago and basically sits on the line today .
In other words , despite 31 years of global warming data the sea ice wo n’t melt .
Despite the doom predictions of the scientists , it ’s just not happening .
Maybe it will in the future , but today , the data shows …..
Nothing
So from the NSIDC page , when referencing the NSIDC graphs :
Please credit the National Snow and Ice Data Center for image or content use unless otherwise noted beneath each image .
I ’m not sure if this is what they meant by ‘ beneath ’ but I believe in giving credit where credit is due , and the NISDC should be ashamed of this post and whichever politician wrote it deserves full credit .
Not that they are .
The forum where I posted this seems to have eaten it , so for posterity and for anyone to whom it might be relevant , here 's : I decided to take advantage of the new US State Dept.
policy for gender marker changes , since I have an upcoming international trip and would rather not explain in a second language why I have a beard and my passport says I 'm female .
Because I did n't trust the system to work correctly without prodding , I made an appointment to appear in person at the Seattle Passport Agency .
You have to do this using an automated phone system , and you can only apply for a passport in person if you can prove that you 're travelling within two weeks .
You also have to wait to make the appointment until your departure is two weeks away or less .
I would never advocate fraud , but I suspect a printed - out hotel reservation for someplace in Canada or Mexico might suffice as proof of travel , or even perhaps a train itinerary ( and both hotel reservations and train tickets are usually refundable ) .
I used a print - out of the e-ticket itinerary that my airline emailed to me and that turned out to be fine .
I had my psychiatrist write a letter according to the boilerplate in the State Dept .'s policy document .
( For the text of the letter , go to the end . )
When I got to the passport agency , I presented my old passport and this letter , along with my filled - out application and photos .
The clerk had obviously never dealt with a gender marker change ( at least not since they changed the policy , maybe at all ) and when she read my letter she asked what " appropriate medical care " meant .
Rather than answering , I showed her a printed - out copy of the policy from the State Dept .'s web site .
She also asked me whether I had attempted to get the change made before .
I thought that might be a way of asking by proxy about surgical status , but my answer was no , so it did n't matter .
She then called attention to my letter not being on official letterhead ( my psychiatrist just changed offices , so she printed the letter on regular paper and attached a business card instead ) .
I thought that probably reflected that they would look for any reason to deny the request .
I pointed out that the business card was attached , and that seemed to satisfy her .
I was told to come back about four hours later , and when I did , the new passport with my correct gender was ready .
I had to pay $ 160 for the privilege ( most of which was the surcharge for using the expedited passport service ) .
I hope this is useful to anyone thinking about getting their passport corrected under the new policy .
It 's a little disappointing that no one apparently bothered to tell the passport center clerks about the new policy ( especially when it comes to reminding them not to ask irrelevant questions ) , but not surprising .
On the whole , though , it seems like more or less anyone who has access to a sympathetic medical professional can get a correct passport now , and that 's good news .
Here 's the text of the letter .
I do n't believe there 's such a thing as " gender identity disorder " , but suspending disbelief seems a small price to pay .
[ doctor 's name , address , phone number , fax ] To Whom It May Concern : I am a fully licensed and board certified physician in good standing with the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners , State license number nnnn .
My DEA number is nnnn .
I am writing this letter as supporting identification to obtain a passport for one of my patients , [ me ] .
I am the attending psychiatrist for him .[ me ] has been a patient under my care for 2 years .
He has gender identity disorder .
To my knowledge , he has had appropriate medical care to transition gender from female to male .
This being the case , his passport should represent his gender as male .
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the forgoing is true and correct .
If there are any further questions , I can usually be reached via my answering service at [ phone ] , 24 hours a day .
Thank you for your assistance in this matter .
Sincerely , [ doctor ]
FLORENCE , Italy 
The Galileo case is often seen starkly as science ’s first decisive blow against not only faith but also the power of the Roman Catholic Church .
It has never been quite that simple , though .
Galileo was a believer , devastated at being convicted , in 1633 , of heresy for upending the biblical view of the universe .
Now a particularly enduring Catholic practice is on prominent display in , of all places , Florence ’s history of science museum , recently renovated and renamed to honor Galileo : Modern - day supporters of the famous heretic are exhibiting newly recovered bits of his body  three fingers and a gnarly molar sliced from his corpse nearly a century after he died  as if they were the relics of an actual saint .
“ He ’s a secular saint , and relics are an important symbol of his fight for freedom of thought , ” said Paolo Galluzzi , the director of the Galileo Museum , which put the tooth , thumb and index finger on view last month , uniting them with another of the scientist ’s digits already in its collection .
“ He ’s a hero and martyr to science , ” he added .
How the relics returned makes for an appropriate new chapter in the life and legacy of Galileo , which is still under debate .
In 1992 , the church came around to acknowledging that the judges who had convicted him of heresy had erred , but it did not quite clear Galileo either .
And the relics ’ return underscores , yet again , continuing tensions between the church and secular culture in Italy .
CAEN , France ( AP )  Chelsea winger Gael Kakuta set up Alexandre Lacazette for a late winning goal Friday as France rallied to beat Spain 2 - 1 to win the under - 19 European Championship for the second time .
With five minutes remaining , Kakuta took the ball and spun around in midfield , dribbling past the two central defenders with sudden changes of direction .
Kakuta 's shot was saved by goalkeeper Alex , but he followed up and chipped the ball perfectly for Lacazette to head in at the far post .
Spain , which has won the tournament four times , took the lead in the 18th minute through striker Rodrigo before Gilles Sunu equalized for the French in the 49th after being expertly set up by forward Yannis Tafer .
France coach Francis Smerecki said his players were desperate to make up for losing to Spain in the Euro under - 17 final two years ago .
" I have known some of these players for four years , and they really deserve to be champions of Europe , " Smerecki said .
" They were really disappointed to lose the under - 17 final two years ago .
They really wanted to win tonight . "
Lacazette and Tafer play for Lyon and both came off the bench in the second half as Smerecki changed to a more attacking lineup .
" Once again we saw the importance of the substitute 's bench , because both players who came on did really well .
It 's the victory of a whole squad , " Smerecki said .
" To stop this Spanish team , you have to stop them getting the ball to their feet .
That 's what we managed to do after the break by being more aggressive . "
Spain looked totally in control in the first half with France unable to create a good scoring chance .
" At the start of the second half we told each other that we had nothing to lose , " France striker Cedric Bakambu said .
" The fans got behind us , and that is pleasing . "
Spain 's coach Luis Milla said his players deserved more , but praised France for its resilience .
" We were controlling the match ... but matches last 90 minutes and we were n't able to stay with France in the second half , " he said .
" At this level , you lose a match on small details .
Once France equalized they had the upper hand . "
Having kept out Sergio Canales ' earlier attempt , France goalkeeper Abdoulaye Diallo was beaten by Rodrigo 's low strike from the left of the penalty area after he collected a pass from Daniel Pacheco .
Pacheco then hit a firm shot wide of the top left corner in the 34th as Spain dominated , with France unable to string passes together and giving the ball away cheaply by trying to play too quickly .
Moments before Sunu 's goal , Spain should have made it 2 - 0 in the 48th .
Diallo failed to control defender Sebastien Faure 's back pass and Canales stole the ball , forcing Diallo to dive at his feet .
But Spain was caught out a minute later when Diallo punted clear and Sunu beat defender Martin Montoya in the air and headed the ball down to Tafer , who had come on for Antoine Griezmann .
Collecting Sunu 's headed pass , Tafer then put Sunu clean through and Sunu < emdash /> who was loaned out by Premier League club Arsenal to second - tier side Derby last season < emdash /> coolly chipped the ball over Alex .
Spain almost equalized shortly after when Marc Bartra burst through and his shot from a narrow angle was palmed away by Diallo .
Alex made a great save to deny Tafer in the 80th , beating away his shot with his right hand after Bakambu 's pass released him down the left .
France previously won the tournament in 2005 , while Spain 's wins were in ' 02 , ' 04 , '06 and ' 07 .

The main camera being use is the Canon 5D MkII and both DoP Tim Palmer and Director Charles Sturridge are already huge fans .
In fact Tim will be using the 5D on all the moving car shots and interiors of a new series of ‘ Hustle ’ as well after his recent experience .
The full story of the shoot will be in our next issue and Digital Issue .
BARCELONA , Spain -- Rafael Marquez was released Saturday from the final two seasons of his contract with Barcelona , a move that allowed the 31 - year - old Mexican defender to join former teammate Thierry Henry with Major League Soccer 's New York Red Bulls .
The Spanish champions announced the agreement with Marquez , whose contract had been scheduled to run through June 2012 .
Hours later , the Red Bulls scheduled a Tuesday news conference to announce the signing of a star player , without saying who it was .
Marquez did n't say where he would sign , although his talks with the Red Bulls have been common knowledge in soccer circles .
His release allows him to sign with New York without a transfer fee .
" We 're analyzing the options that we have and we 'll see what works best , " Marquez said .
A farewell ceremony was held Saturday at Camp Nou .
" One of the our team 's reference points leaves Barcelona to start a new stage , " team president Sandro Rosell said .
" Rafa Marquez has been a key player for our last two coaches . "
Since arriving from Monaco in 2003 , Marquez helped Barcelona win two Champions League titles , four Spanish league championships , a European Supercup and a Copa del Rey trophy .
He said a lack of playing time last season clinched his decision .
" I could have stayed and played less , but that 's not my character , " Marquez said .
" At this moment the coach believes in other players , and I thought it was the adequate moment to go . "
Marquez , who also plays in central midfield , had 13 goals in 242 matches with the Catalan club .
He has 11 goals in 94 appearances for Mexico and was El Tri's captain at the World Cup , where he scored against South Africa .
Henry left Barcelona to sign with the Red Bulls earlier in the month , and the French forward was set to make his MLS debut Saturday night at Houston .

Danziger Bridge could have slipped back to being just a name on a map if the cover - up had succeeded .
But as prosecutors accuse four New Orleans police officers of gunning down unarmed residents on its span , killing two , we know it will always stand for much more .
Here the last bonds of trust between a city and its guardians died .
The alleged crimes occurred one week after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
The lasting shame may be that it has taken almost five years for federal charges to be filed .
But their unveiling by the US Attorney General Eric Holder had the power and ominous shock of a thunderclap .
The defendants , if found guilty , could spend the rest of their lives in prison – or they could face the death penalty .
Chaos came in several forms in the woebegone city in the days after the storm .
Four - fifths was under water , hospitals lost power and public shelters were fouled by human waste .
And there was a police department that became unhinged , nowhere more horrifically than on Danziger Bridge .
The indictments unsealed late on Tuesday allege what the families of the victims have asserted from the start .
On 4 September 2005 , the four officers fired on six civilians – going to shop for groceries and check on family property – without justification .
Four were wounded – a woman had part of her arm blown off , her husband was shot in the head .
Two were killed .
Even if the city has been reliving the tragedy for some time – state charges were filed against the defendants in 2006 , but that case later fell apart – the details in the federal indictments still had the power to appal .
They describe the shooting in the back of the mentally disabled man , Ronald Madison , as he tried to run away , and offer a new detail : after Madison fell , already mortally wounded , one of the officers stamped on his body .
Those facing possible death sentences are the police officers Kenneth Bowen , Robert Gisevius and Anthony Villavaso as well as former officer Robert Faulcon .
They are charged not with murder but rather " deprivation of rights under colour of law " .
Along with two other officers , they are also charged with attempting to construct an elaborate cover - up that hinged on their assertions at the time that they had been fired upon on the bridge , which , it is alleged , they had n't .
In court in New Orleans yesterday , three of the men – Mr Bowen , Mr Gisevius and Mr Villavaso , pleaded not guilty to all charges .
Mr Faulcon was not in the courtroom , but is awaiting extradition from Texas to Louisiana to stand trial .
Eric Hessler , a lawyer representing Mr Gisevius , said that no consideration had been given to the chaos police were operating in during the first few days after Hurricane Katrina .
" The federal government has clearly forgotten or chosen to ignore the circumstances police officers were working under , " he told The New York Times .
According to the criminal indictments , the four officers arrived at the scene in a Budget rental van after receiving a radio message from a colleague nearby suggesting that officers may have come under fire from unidentified assailants .
What they found when they got to the bridge was merely a straggle of pedestrians crossing from New Orleans to the other side .
Then , the complaint says , the firing began .
James Brissette , 17 , was with a friend 's family heading eastwards in search of groceries .
The group tried to hide behind a concrete divider on the bridge .
The head wound and the partially lost arm were among the injuries they suffered .
The bullets that hit James killed him .
Before he turned to flee , Ronald Madison was on his way with his brother , Lance , to check on the surgery of another brother , Rommel , a prominent New Orleans dentist .
After the killing – and kicking – of Ronald , Lance was arrested by the officers .
On him they hung their story of having come under fire .
He was held for three weeks on charges of trying to kill a police officer before being released for lack of evidence , such as a gun .
That the four officers on the bridge could now be sent to Death Row , if found guilty , seemed yesterday to have left Rommel Madison – the brother of Ronald and Lance – in a quandary .
" I do n't want to see anyone executed , but I guess I have to keep in mind that they executed my brother , " he said .
Tom Perez , the head of the US Justice Department 's civil rights division , said that the indictments were " a reminder that the Constitution and the rule of law do not take a holiday – even after a hurricane " .
But one New Orleans resident whose home virtually backs on to Danziger Bridge , gave voice to what many in the city still feel : they have a police force they cannot trust .
" They put doubt in my mind about the police officers because , if they did that to those people , what they are going to do to us ? " said Berthe Delonde .
The investigation into the Danziger shootings took two years and more indictments may still come .
The breakthrough for prosecutors that makes the success of the federal case more likely came earlier this year when five former officers reached guilty pleas in connection with the alleged cover - up under which they undertook to offer testimony against the remaining defendants .
In the meantime , Mitch Landrieu barely had his feet under his desk this spring as the new Mayor of New Orleans when he announced that he had asked the federal government to investigate the city 's police force " that has been described by many as one of the worst in the country " .
That review may result in a wholesale restructuring of the department .
Fill her up with spill oil ?
When BP sells the crude from the leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico , the oil could end up at gas stations .
BP said it would use the net revenue made from selling the crude to fund wildlife protection efforts in four Gulf Coast states , the Associated Press reports .
The company did not explain the specifics of how much money will be put into the fund .
BP said in a recent press release the amount will be based on how much oil is collected and the price at which the oil is sold .

MAP : Oil spill growing in the Gulf of Mexico
Since the collected oil contains a high concentration of methanol , BP expects that each barrel will sell at a lower price than regular crude .
Oil taken from the well will be indistinguishable from other oil on the market , Louisiana State University professor Julius Langlinais told the AP .

Cousteau explores the Gulf oil spill
by Samantha Tress | July 15 , 2010
Well - known oceanographer and documentary filmmaker Jean - Michel Cousteau and his organization , Ocean Futures Society , made 2 trips to the Gulf to study the impact that the oil spill is having on marine and terrestrial life .
Cousteau is known for being an ocean explorer and documentarian , and for being the son of Jacques Cousteau .
In 2 interviews with PBS he spoke about what he and his team were finding .
[ youtube ]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8UHoBRHZFk[/youtube]
On June 2 , 2010 , he said he felt that the use of oil dispersants was a mistake .
Causing the oil to sink below the surface ( “ out of sight , out of mind , ” he said ) was a mistake because it is able to go under the booms and toward the shore .
Additionally , the dispersants cause the oil to break into smaller particles , which could be ingested by plankton , the foundation for the ocean ’s food chain .

In the second interview on July 14 , Cousteau said that his team is studying the impacts on animals in the Gulf ’s ecosystem and they are collecting animal samples for autopsies to determine the exact cause of death .
To illustrate how tragic the situation is , he gives the example of dolphins nursing their young in the oily water .
Ocean Futures
Society divers filmed the oil underwater – it ’s very disturbing to see what Gulf marine life must now swim and breathe in .

The remaining 2.5 million cubic yards of ash from TVA 's 5.4 million - cubic - yard Kingston ash spill will remain onsite , according to a TVA plan approved Tuesday by EPA .
The cleanup plan calls for putting ash from the Swan Pond embayment back into a " re-engineered " but still unlined Tennessee Valley Authority dredge cell that failed in late 2008 .
" It 's horrible , " Harriman , Tenn. , resident Sarah McCoin said of the decision .
" TVA 's disaster is going to be kept right in here in Roane County .
And we 're going to be the only location in the country that will be treated differently than ( EPA 's ) new coal waste rules ( that require lined disposal areas ) , " she said .
The work will take four years and cost about $ 268.2 million .
That cost includes an estimated $ 686,000 in annual maintenance expenses for 30 years , according to the agreement between TVA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
TVA and EPA officials said the plan eliminates potential risks and costs of taking the ash off - site and shipping it over public roads or by rail .
Residents say it is " disheartening " for the community that was turned upside down on Dec. 22 , 2008 .
That 's when an earthen wall broke , dumping ash into the Emory River and onto the rural community of Swan Pond in Harriman , Tenn .
EPA project manager Craig Zeller said the re-engineered landfill will have adequate safety features .
" I would counter that this reconstructed cell is going to be a dramatic improvement over what was there , " Mr. Zeller said .
A three - mile dike of soil - cement columns will be constructed using 8 - foot - diameter augers to drill 60 - 70 feet to bedrock , Mr. Zeller said .
The " lattice of columns " will be able to withstand a 6.0 - magnitude earthquake , he said .
Ash will be placed atop a foundation of sand , gravel and geo-fabric and covered with two feet of clay and one foot of topsoil .
Vegetation then will be planted to prevent erosion , he said .
The landfill will be about 30 feet lower than the one that failed , Mr. Zeller said .
Groundwater will be monitored for leaching , he said .
On May 4 , EPA issued its proposed rules for regulating coal ash , but TVA spokeswoman Barbara Martocci said the proposed rules will not affect TVA or the Kingston agreement finalized Tuesday .
Steve McCracken , TVA 's general manager of the Kingston Ash Recovery Project , said TVA and EPA considered three alternatives .
Two involved removing all or part of the spilled ash to landfills in Alabama or above Knoxville .
Mr. McCracken said the choice was made after weighing environmental and human health and safety factors , cost effectiveness and how well each plan could be implemented .
WHERE'S THE ASH ?
When the planned cleanup is complete , the " re-engineered " but still unlined Kingston , Tenn. , coal waste landfill will contain about 17.5 million cubic yards of ash , down from the 20.5 million cubic yards it held when the spill occurred .
When the landfill is finished and closed , oversight will shift from Tennessee to EPA under the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation , and Liability Act.
Source : EPA PUBLIC HEARING
A public hearing on the plan is set for 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Thursday at Roane County High School , 540 West Cumberland St. , Kingston , Tenn .
" And the cost was the last consideration , " he said .
" I think it will still fall somewhere in that range we 've stated before , " between $ 933 million to 1.2 billion .
Mr. Zeller said the sloughs of the river will be restored " to pre-spill conditions and replanted " with aquatic and woodland vegetation and wetlands .
" Residents have said this was the best place to catch crappie , and our goal is to restore that fishery , " he said .
TVA 's Katie Kline said the agency within the year also will be completing a land - use plan for the more than 100 properties it bought from area residents .
Ms. McCoin said she feels betrayed by the decision .
" First , TVA told us they'd get the mess cleaned up in six to eight weeks , and how many times have I heard them say they would be a ' good corporate neighbor ? '
Then when EPA came in , we saw them as a savior .
Now it feels as if we 've been jeopardized by the collaboration of the two . "
To add " salt to the wound , " she said , residents there just got new property appraisals .
" Our property appraisals all went up 130 to 150 percent , " she said .
" How can that be right ? "

Toronto – The RCMP - led Integrated Security Unit ( ISU ) of the G20 is refusing to rule out the use of Agent Provocateurs to get protesters to commit illegal acts , the Toronto Media Co-op has learned .
During a G20 forum on April 30th held by Toronto City Councilors , Constable George Tucker , a member of the G20 planning team responsible for Public Affairs , Communications & Corporate Relations , was asked if Agent Provocateurs would be used .
He responded : “ " I 'm not at liberty to discuss security issues in an open format " .
However , a question remains that police have not been asked : is the use of Agent Provocateurs legal ?
If not , why wo n’t police rule it out ?
Gary Davidson , a retired RCMP officer who was active in VIP security , says they are illegal , although he does not think the RCMP uses them : “ I can not speak for other police forces [ such as Toronto Police Services , the Ontario Provincial Police , etc. ] but I can say that although the RCMP probably would have plain clothed police mixed in with the crowd , the RCMP has never used provocateurs .
Basically , they hope all the protesters just go away .
To the best of my knowledge , the use of Agent Provocateurs is illegal in Canada and that the RCMP would not and has not engaged in such practice , ” he explained in an e-mail .
During a phone interview with the Media Co-op , Constable Meghan Gray with the TPS G20 Planning Team responsible for Public Affairs , Communications & Community Relations , was also asked directly whether Agent Provocateurs would be used .
Toronto Media Co-op : Can you confirm or deny that you will be using agent provocateurs ?
Do you think they are illegal ?
Meaghan Gray : “ Like [ my co-worker ] , George Tucker , those are operational issues , I ca n’t speak to that . ”
TMC : “ A source from the RCMP has told me their use is illegal .
Are you saying you ca n’t rule out an illegal activity will be used ? ”
Gray : “ Well … I ’d have to ask someone else about that ….
I ’ll get somebody to get back to you . ”
Gray responded via e-mail 2 hours later .
“ I have spoken with my colleagues on the Public Affairs Team and as I stated , with respect to your questions regarding Agents Provocateurs , the Integrated Security Unit for the G8 - G20 Summits will not discuss operational details , ” she wrote .
Though Gray stated that “ all police efforts will be lawful ” , this is not the first time that an ISU for a summit has been asked about Agent Provocateurs .
Nor is it the first time they have refused to respond .
In 2007 , well - documented actions by police in at a summit in Montebello spawned numerous claims that undercover officers tried to incite violence .
Youtube videos posted after the summit clearly show three protesters with bandanas covering their faces being confronted by protesters for being Agent Provocateurs and then retreating behind police lines .
Quebec provincial police later admitted the three were undercover officers but denied they were trying to incite violence .
In light of the actions in Montebello , a number of inquiries were made about the possible use of Agent Provocateurs by the ISU during the Vancouver Olympic Games .
When the Vancouver - weekly Georgia Straight asked about the use of Agent Provocateurs Corporal Jen Allen of the ISU responded : “ We are not in a position to detail a specific operational plan as to how we are going to fulfill that obligation . ”
Robert Holmes of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association also asked the ISU in Vancouver about the use of agents provocateurs during the Olympic Games .
Speaking in the Straight Holmes says he was told by the ISU that “ all plans were confidential . ”
This is the first in a three - part series .

Oh , man , bummer news coming from the Candy Claws camp today .
The outfit , in the midst of an East Coast tour , lost all of its gear yesterday , along with their merch and a good deal of personal effects in car fire somewhere on I - 76 in Pennsylvania .
No word yet as to the cause of the fire , but as you can see from the picture above and the ones after the jump , the vehicle is a total loss .
Fortunately , all of the members of the Fort Collins - based act reportedly escaped the blaze without injury and are planning to finish the remaining dates on this leg of the tour , before returning to Colorado next week , and then heading back for more dates on the West Coast .
A Paypal account has been established , and according to Greta Cornett , there 's talks of organizing a benefit show for the act .
More details on that as they become available .

OUTGOING prime minister Julia Gillard says she wo n’t contest her federal seat at the next election .
Ms Gillard earlier on Wednesday lost the Labor leadership challenge to Kevin Rudd .
She had previously said the loser of the caucus ballot should leave federal politics .
“ I have written to the Governor - General , asking her to commission Rudd as Prime Minister of Australia , ” Ms Gillard told reporters .
“ I will shortly leave from this parliament to see the Governor - General on this matter . ”
Ms Gillard will not recontest her Victorian seat of Lalor at the upcoming federal election .
Ms Gillard congratulated Mr Rudd on his election as leader of the minority Labor government .
She said she was humbled by having had the privilege to be prime minister , and Australia ’s first female prime minister .
“ When I first put myself forward for consideration as Labor leader in 2010 I had the overwhelming support of my colleagues to do so .
I thank them for that , ” she said .
“ And I thank them for giving the opportunity to me not only to serve the nation but to serve as the first female prime minister of this country . ”
Ms Gillard said she had faced the “ twin problems ” of a minority parliament and “ internal division ” within Labor .
“ It has not been an easy environment to work in . ”
Ms Gillard urged Labor MPs and candidates to get out and win the election .
“ Do n’t lack the guts , do n’t lack the fortitude , do n’t lack the resilience to go out there with our Labor agenda and to win this election , ” she said .
“ I know that it can be done . ”
Ms Gillard said there had been a lot of talk about her playing the “ gender card ” .
“ The reaction to being the first female prime minister does not explain everything about my prime ministership , nor does it explain nothing about my prime ministership , ” she said .
“ It explains some things and it is for the nation to think in a sophisticated way about those shades of grey .
“ What I am absolutely confident of is it will be easier for the next woman and the woman after that … and I am proud of that . ”

Professor at American University predicts Obama win in 2012 by Joseph Ernest July 12 , 2010 NewscastMedia --
A college professor at American University is using a 13 - Key system to predict the outcome of the 2012 presidential race and says that Obama wins hands down .
Professor Allan Lichtman said , “ Nothing that a candidate has said or done during a campaign , when the public discounts everything as political , has changed his prospects at the polls .
Debates , advertising , television appearances , news coverage , and campaign strategies — the usual grist for the punditry mills — count for virtually nothing on Election Day . ”
Lichtman says that the health care bill counts as a positive for the Democratic Party , leaving the party with only four keys likely turned against it for 2012 — two short of the fatal six negative keys .
With nine keys that currently favor the incumbent party , Lichtman says President Obama could endure an additional setback , such as the recent political fallout from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , and still be reelected .
Below are the 13 Keys Lichtman is using to predict a 2012 Obama win : KEY 1 ( Party Mandate ) :
After the midterm elections , the incumbent party holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives than it did after the previous midterm elections .
( FALSE )
KEY 2 ( Contest ) :
There is no serious contest for the incumbent - party nomination .
( TRUE )
KEY 3 ( Incumbency ) :
The incumbent - party candidate is the sitting president .
( TRUE )
KEY 4 ( Third party ) :
There is no significant third party or independent campaign .
( TRUE )
KEY 5 ( Short - term economy ) :
The economy is not in recession during the election campaign .
( TRUE )
KEY 6 ( Long - term economy ) : Real per-capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms .
( FALSE )
KEY 7 ( Policy change ) :
The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy .
( TRUE )
KEY 8 ( Social unrest ) :
There is no sustained social unrest during the term .
( TRUE )
KEY 9 ( Scandal ) :
The administration is untainted by major scandal .
( TRUE )
KEY 10 ( Foreign / military failure ) :
The administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs .
( TRUE )
KEY 11 ( Foreign / military success ) :
The administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs .
( FALSE )
KEY 12 ( Incumbent charisma ) :
The incumbent - party candidate is charismatic or a national hero .
( FALSE )
KEY 13 ( Challenger charisma ) :
The challenging - party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero .
( TRUE ) According to his book Keys To The White House , Lichtman asserts that “ 13 Keys ” are conditions that favor reelection of the incumbent party candidate .
When five or fewer are false , the incumbent party candidate wins .
When six or more are false , the other party candidate wins .

BPA Coats Cash Register Receipts
Tests Find Chemical - Laden Receipts at National Retailers
Update : see report on green chemistry pioneer John Warner 's new research on BPA in receipts here .
The plastic component bisphenol A ( BPA ) has been in the headlines nonstop as scientists , health experts and consumers press for a federal ban on food packaging made with this synthetic estrogen , shown to leach readily into infant formula , beverages and canned food .
But most Americans are probably unaware that they are regularly exposed to the same endocrine - disrupting chemical in cash register receipts .
Two - fifths of the paper receipts tested by a major laboratory commissioned by Environmental Working Group were on heat - activated paper that was between 0.8 to nearly 3 percent pure BPA by weight .
Wipe tests conducted with a damp laboratory paper easily picked up a portion of the receipts '
BPA coating , indicating that the chemical would likely stick to the skin of anyone who handled them .
The receipts came from major retailers , grocery stores , convenience stores , gas stations , fast - food restaurants , post offices and automatic teller machines ( ATMs ) .
Major retailers using BPA - containing receipts in at least some outlets included McDonald's , CVS , KFC , Whole Foods , Walmart , Safeway and the U.S. Postal Service .
Receipts from some major chains , including Target , Starbucks and Bank of America ATMs , issued receipts that were BPA - free or contained only trace amounts .
Scientists have not determined how much of a receipt 's BPA coating can transfer to the skin and from there into the body .
Possibilities being explored include :
Oral exposure -- BPA moves from receipts onto fingers and then onto food and into the mouth .
Dermal exposure -- BPA from receipts is directly absorbed through the skin into the body .
A study published July 11 by Swiss scientists found that BPA transfers readily from receipts to skin and can penetrate the skin to such a depth that it cannot be washed off ( Biedermann 2010 ) .
This raises the possibility that the chemical infiltrates the skin's lower layers to enter the bloodstream directly .
BPA has also been shown to penetrate skin in laboratory studies ( Kaddar 2008 ) .
EWG collected 36 receipts and commissioned the University of Missouri Division of Biological Sciences laboratory to investigate their BPA content .
This laboratory is considered one of the world 's foremost research facilities in its capability to detect environmentally relevant BPA concentrations .
The Missouri scientists found that the total mass of BPA on a receipt is 250 to 1,000 times greater than the amount of BPA typically found in a can of food or a can of baby formula , or that which leaches from a BPA - based plastic baby bottle into its contents .
These data should not be interpreted to suggest that policymakers shift their focus from BPA contamination of food , which is widespread , to receipts .
BPA exposure from food sources is ubiquitous and should remain the first priority of U.S. policymakers .
However , a significant portion of the public may also be exposed to BPA by handling receipts .
Since many retailers do not use BPA - laden thermal paper , this particular route of exposure is easy to correct .
Biomonitoring surveys by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found BPA in the bodies of 93 percent of Americans over age 6 .
EWG analysis of CDC data has found that people who reported working in retail industries had 30 percent more BPA in their bodies than the average U.S. adult , and 34 percent more BPA than other workers .
( CDC 2004 ) .
As of May 2009 , 1 in 17 working Americans -- 7 million people -- were employed as retail salespersons and cashiers , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
EWG 's biomonitoring study of minority newborns , published last December , found BPA in 9 of 10 samples , marking the first detections of the chemical in the cord blood of U.S. infants .
EWG has published a Safe Baby Bottle and Formula Guide to help parents of infants avoid BPA and other harmful substances during this critical window of development .
In animal tests , scientists have produced evidence that BPA can induce abnormal reproductive system development , diminished intellectual capacity and behavioral abnormalities and can set the stage for other serious conditions , such as reproductive system cancer , obesity , diabetes , early puberty , resistance to chemotherapy , asthma and cardiovascular system disorders .
It has caused epigenetic changes , meaning alterations in the way genes switch off and on and genetic changes that can be passed on to the next generations .
Frequent exposures to relatively large amounts of BPA in receipts are an obvious concern to every shopper , but even more so to the legions of people who staff cash registers and bag groceries at tens of thousands of retailers across the country .
These workers handle BPA - loaded receipts hundreds of times a day , with as yet unknown consequences for their health ( Biedermann et al 2010 ) .
According to the U.S. Department of Labor ’s Bureau of Labor Statistics , as of May 2009 , the two largest U.S. occupations were “ retail salespersons ” and “ cashiers , ” with more than 7 million Americans in those jobs .
Retail workers carry an average of 30 percent more BPA in their bodies than other adults ,
It is unclear how much BPA - coated receipts contribute to people 's total exposure to the ubiquitous plastics chemical .
What is certain , however , is that since many retail outlets already use BPA - free paper for their receipts , this is one source of contamination that could easily be eliminated completely .
Thermal paper is widely used for point - of - sale receipts , prescription labels , airline tickets and lottery tickets .
Thermal printers use paper that is coated with a dye and developer ( BPA or an alternative chemical ) .
Heat from the thermal printing head triggers a reaction between the dye and developer , allowing the black print to appear .
In an effort to quantify how much BPA would transfer to a person ’s hand , the laboratory performed wipe tests on four BPA - laden receipts .
In all four cases , BPA transferred from the receipts to the wipes .
An average of 2.4 percent of the receipts ’ total BPA content wiped off , suggesting that a person who handled receipts would be exposed to some BPA in the thermal paper .
There have been no published studies of BPA residues inside pockets , purses and wallets , on wet produce in grocery bags or on the hands of people after they crumpled and discarded a receipt .
Since 60 percent of the receipts EWG collected did not have significant levels of BPA , it is apparent that many retailers are using alternatives .
The leading U.S. thermal paper maker , Wisconsin - based Appleton Papers Inc. , no longer incorporates BPA in any of its thermal papers ( Raloff 2009 ) .
Reacting to concerns about the toxicity of BPA , the Japan Paper Association began to halt the use of BPA in 1998 , completing the phase - out by 2003 ( AIST 2007 ) .
EWG 's analysis of three receipts collected in Japan at KFC , McDonald 's and Starbucks found only trace amounts of BPA .
In addition , 11 of 13 U.S. - based retailers whose receipts EWG tested used non-BPA paper in at least one outlet .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has initiated a program to evaluate the safety and availability of alternatives to BPA in thermal paper ( EPA 2010 ) .
EWG urges retailers to use BPA - free paper and to consider paperless options such as emailed electronic receipts .
These measures could greatly reduce the volume of BPA disseminated by the retail industry and save paper in the bargain .
Retailers should make public the identity of any chemicals used in the alternative they select .
Very little information is publicly available on the now - common BPA alternatives for thermal receipts .
Tips to reduce exposures to BPA in receipts
Minimize receipt collection by declining receipts at gas pumps , ATMs and other machines when possible .
Store receipts separately in an envelope in a wallet or purse .
Never give a child a receipt to hold or play with .
After handling a receipt , wash hands before preparing and eating food ( a universally recommended practice even for those who have not handled receipts ) .
Do not use alcohol - based hand cleaners after handling receipts .
A recent study showed that these products can increase the skin's BPA absorption ( Biedermann 2010 ) .
Take advantage of store services that email or archive paperless purchase records .
Do not recycle receipts and other thermal paper .
BPA residues from receipts will contaminate recycled paper .
If you are unsure , check whether paper is thermally treated by rubbing it with a coin .
Thermal paper discolors with the friction ; conventional paper does not .
Methodology and Findings .
EWG collected 36 receipts from retailers in seven states and the District of Columbia :
Ten national retail and service chains , including Walmart , Chevron and McDonald's ;
Three government establishments - the U.S. Postal Service and the cafeterias in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate ; and
One local supermarket in Colorado .
We contracted with the analytical laboratory at the University of Missouri - Columbia 's Division of Biological Sciences to perform the analysis .
The laboratory weighed , measured and photographed the receipts , dissolved them in an alcohol , then analyzed them for BPA using a sensitive , standard BPA test method ( High - Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) with CoulArray detection ) .
The laboratory detected substantial amounts of BPA on 16 of 36 receipts at an average amount of 1.9 percent by weight , and a range of 0.8 to 2.8 percent ( Table 1 ) .

* Only trace BPA levels were detected on wipe samples of receipts not coated with BPA .
Safeway supermarket receipts had the highest levels by several measures .
Safeway receipts had 3 of the top 6 highest overall BPA levels .
A store in the District of Columbia had the greatest total estimated mass of BPA ( 41 milligrams ) .
A Berkeley , CA Safeway had the highest concentration of BPA relative to the paper mass ( 2.8 percent of the receipt weight ) .
Safeway was one of two retailers that had detectable BPA in all three store locations sampled .
The receipt for a McDonald 's Happy Meal™ purchased in Clinton , Conn. on April 21 , 2010 had an estimated 13 milligrams of BPA .
That equals the amount of BPA in 126 cans of Chef Boyardee Overstuffed Beef Ravioli in Hearty Tomato & Meat Sauce , one of the products with the highest concentrations of BPA in EWG 's 2007 tests of canned foods ( EWG 2007 ) .
Source : BPA test results from the University of Missouri Division of Biological Sciences Laboratory , for receipts collected by EWG .
* BPA at trace level or not detected .
EWG also collected receipts from stores and bank ATMs in three or four cities for each of the ten national retail and service chains sampled .
Analysis of the laboratory tests found that of the 10 stores and bank ATMs :
One , Safeway , issued BPA - containing receipts in all cities .
Six issued a BPA - laden receipt in at least one , but not all , outlets - CVS , Walmart , KFC , Whole Foods , Chevron , and McDonald 's - indicating that these retailers use BPA - free receipts at some outlets .
Three provided receipts that were BPA - free or contained only trace amounts at all locations - Bank of America , Target and Starbucks .
EWG also collected receipts from post offices and government cafeterias .
All receipts from the U.S. Postal Service contained BPA .
A receipt from the U.S. House of Representatives cafeteria contained BPA , while a receipt from the U.S. Senate cafeteria did not .
The laboratory performed four wipe samples on four BPA - laden receipts - 0.7 - to -3.8 percent of the BPA detected on the receipt easily wiped off onto a lightly moistened , BPA - free laboratory paper , with an average of 2.4 percent wiping off .
EWG also collected receipts from three retailers in Japan , at KFC , Starbucks and McDonald 's outlets in the city of Sendai .
None contained BPA above trace levels .
In our U.S. samples , KFC and McDonald 's issued BPA - containing receipts in at least one location .
Sources of Americans ' exposures to BPA .
BPA exposure is ubiquitous in the U.S. population .
The CDC's National Biomonitoring Program found the chemical in the urine of 93 percent of Americans age six and older ( Calafat 2008 ) .
Researchers have considered BPA contamination of canned foods and beverages to be the primary sources of exposure in most populations , especially for infants and children .
In 2007 , Environmental Working Group published a ground - breaking study documenting that BPA had leached from epoxy can linings into more than half the canned foods , beverages and canned liquid infant formula randomly purchased at supermarkets around the country .
In the absence of any U.S. regulation on BPA contamination of food , EWG has published an online guide to baby - safe bottles and formula .
However , a recent study suggests that other sources may also be important ( Stahlhut 2009 ) .
These researchers measured urinary levels of BPA in 1,469 adults after variable periods of fasting .
They expected BPA levels in urine to fall rapidly in the absence of new food exposures , since the chemical is excreted very quickly from the body .
Instead , BPA levels dropped only slowly , leading them to theorize that BPA from sources other than food may be significant , or , alternatively , that BPA may be stored in human fat and released slowly and constantly into the body .
EWG assessed CDC biomonitoring data from Americans tested between 2003 and 2004 to learn if retail workers carry higher amounts of BPA in their bodies than other adults .
CDC provided employment information for 916 of 1,862 adults tested .
EWG analysis found that the 195 people who reported working in retail industries had 28 percent more BPA in their bodies than the average U.S. adult , and 34 percent more BPA than other workers .
EWG also found that four of the five occupations with the highest BPA measurements may come in contact with receipts , including those in retail department stores , communications , retail food stores , and eating and drinking establishments ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 . CDC biomonitoring studies indicate that retail workers are exposed to more BPA than other adults
Population tested Number of people tested Geometric mean concentration of BPA ( ug/L ) Male ( age 18 and above ) 801 2.7 Female ( age 18 and above ) 864 2.3
All adults ( age 18 and above ) 1,665 2.5 All workers 916 2.5 Non-retail workers 721 2.4 Retail workers * 195 3.2

* Retail workers include people designated in CDC employment groups 23 - 28 ( CDC 2004 ) .
EWG recommends that retailers switch to non-BPA receipt technologies immediately to help reduce their employees ' BPA exposures .
APPENDIX - LABORATORY METHODOLOGY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE / QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES
Laboratory Methodology - EWG staff collected receipts in seven U.S. states -- California , Colorado , Connecticut , Iowa , Maryland , Oregon and Virginia -- and the District of Columbia .
Samplers wore clean , powder - free nitrile gloves ( Dynarex ) .
They received the receipt from the cashier and held it gently between two fingers .
Once away from the cashier , samplers rolled the receipts with minimal handling and placed them into clean polyurethane 50 mL tubes ( Fischer Scientific ) .
They noted the time , date , location , items purchased , temperature and humidity as well as the location where receipts were rolled and tubed .
ATM and gas station receipts were collected directly from the machines in most cases .
EWG sent receipts to a laboratory at University of Missouri - Columbia , Division of Biological Sciences in Columbia , Mo .
The laboratory weighed , measured and photographed the receipts , analyzed for BPA and screened for bisphenol B , bisphenol S and bisphenol F , using high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with CoulArray detection .
The standard curve in our assay ranges from 0.05 - 4 nanograms per HPLC run .
Four receipts that had values below and above the range of the standard curve are considered to be outside the limit of quantitation of the assay .
These estimated values were different from five samples labeled as " non-detectable ( ND ) , " in which there was no evidence of BPA .
Digestion analysis : Lengths of receipt weighing 200 mg each were cut and placed in a glass tube .
No attempt was made to control for the amount of printing on the receipt .
The receipts were incubated in methanol ( 15 ml , to cover the receipt ) for 3 hours at room temperature , with occasional agitation .
The methanol was then poured into clean glass tubes and diluted for analysis .
Migration analysis : EWG selected 9 of the collected receipts for migration analysis .
For these , a piece of lab wipe ( KimWipe ) was lightly dampened with methanol and wiped in a zigzag fashion across the top ( printed ) surface of a 5 cm by 5 cm piece of receipt .
This wipe was then soaked in methanol for 3 hours at room temperature , and the methanol then decanted and analyzed for BPA .
Quality assurance / Quality control procedures
The laboratory found no detectable BPA on sampling materials , including KimWipes , gloves and shipping tubes .
The laboratory assessed recoveries of BPA from paper by spiking a piece of filter paper approximately 8 - by - 8 centimeters with BPA and soaking it in methanol , as described for the sales receipts .
This method only approximates BPA recovery from receipts since the paper and coating matrices are different .
The laboratory also analyzed samples with added BPA to determine whether the sample extract quenches or augments BPA measurements .
Recoveries in positive controls averaged 92 percent .
Sample data values presented in this study are not corrected for recovery .
The laboratory did not detect BPB , BPF and BPS in the receipts tested .
Unidentified peaks were seen in some receipt samples that did not contain BPA .
Some of these appeared to reflect high concentrations .

Griechische Milliarden für deutsche U - Boote Jens Berger
Obwohl Griechenland in fast allen Bereichen sparen muss , ermuntern Deutschland und Frankreich die Hellenen zu einem absurden Rüstungswettlauf mit der Türkei
Griechenland hat zwar lediglich 11 Millionen Einwohner , ist aber dennoch Europas größter Waffenimporteur - weltweit steht es an fünfter Stelle .
Über Jahre hinweg verkauften deutsche Konzerne mit Protektion der Bundesregierung ihre neuesten Innovationen an die Griechen .
Ein todsicheres Geschäft , schließlich liefert man sich auf beiden Seiten der Ägäis einen absurden Rüstungswettlauf .
Jeder Auftrag aus Athen zieht einen Auftrag aus Ankara nach sich - und umgekehrt .
Und wenn die Griechen ihre Wehrtechnik Made in Germany nicht bezahlen können , hilft halt der deutsche Steuerzahler aus .
Ein Ausstieg aus dieser Spirale der Unvernunft ist nicht in Sicht .
Anstatt bei den Verteidigungsausgaben zu sparen , orderte Athen in diesem Jahr zwei neue deutsche U - Boote und sechs französische Fregatten .
Die Konkurrenzaufträge mit Ankara sind schließlich bereits unterschrieben .
Bild : Einweihung des ersten U - Bootes der Klasse 214 .
Griechische Marine
U - Boot - Technik aus Kiel
Ein Land wie Griechenland , dessen Küstenlinie von über 3.000 Inseln geprägt und dessen wichtigster Wirtschaftsbereich die Handelsschifffahrt ist , hat natürlich ein vitales Interesse an einer möglichst schlagkräftigen Marine - vor allem dann , wenn es mit dem vermeintlichen Erbfeind Türkei immer noch offene Grenzstreitigkeiten in der Ägäis gibt .
Griechenlands U - Boot - Flotte ist zwar Made in Germany , aber hoffnungslos überaltert .
Die acht U - Boote vom Typ 209/1100 und 209/1200 wurden in den Jahren 1967 und 1975 geordert und sind trotz kostenintensiver Modernisierung durch deutsche Werften nicht mehr auf dem Stand der Technik , sondern gehen langsam aber sicher auf das Ende ihrer Dienstzeit zu .
Im Jahre 2000 orderte die griechische Marine bei der Kieler HDW daher vier moderne U - Boote vom Typ 214 , der als Exportversion auf dem Design der deutschen Typ - 212 - Serie aufbaut und international als State - of - the - Art im konventionellen Bereich gilt .
Die Boote der Klassen 212 und 214 verfügen über einen nahezu lautlosen Brennstoffzellen - Antrieb , der einen wochenlangen Betrieb unter Wasser erlaubt .
Der deutsch - griechische Deal sah den Bau eines U - Bootes in Kiel und die Endfertigung der drei Nachfolger in den Hellenic Shipyards in Skaramagas bei Athen vor , die speziell zu diesem Zweck von der HDW - Gruppe , die damals zum Thyssen - Krupp - Konzern gehörte , übernommen wurden .
Der Kater nach dem Kaufrausch
Kaum war die Tinte unter dem Vertrag trocken , bereuten die Griechen jedoch bereits ihren Kaufrausch .
Griechenland hatte sich in den Verträgen von Maastricht verpflichtet , die Neuverschuldung unter die 3 % - Grenze zu bringen und der U - Boot - Deal , der ein Volumen von 2,8 Milliarden Euro hat , war nach den Konvergenzkriterien eigentlich nicht finanzierbar .
Um sowohl den Euro als auch die deutschen U - Boote zu bekommen , versuchte man es in Athen mit Bilanzkosmetik .
Die Sozialisten verschoben die U - Boot - Milliarden munter in die Geschäftsjahre der Konservativen , die das Geld - von dem 70 % bereits bei Auftragsstellung nach Deutschland transferiert wurden - schließlich munter in die Zukunft buchten .
Die Brüsseler und Berliner Haushaltsexperten schauten angestrengt weg und so konnten die Griechen das Kunststück vollbringen , die U - Boot - Milliarden acht Jahre zu " verstecken " und erst in den Katastrophenhaushalt 2009 einfließen zu lassen .
Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hätten die Griechen die Verträge am liebsten für null und nichtig erklärt .
Das erste U - Boot , die S 120 Papanikolis , lief bereits 2004 in Kiel vom Stapel .
Die griechischen Marineoffiziere entdeckten jedoch bei den Testfahrten in der Ostsee echte oder vermeintliche Konstruktionsmängel und weigerten sich , die Papanikolis zu übernehmen .
Der deutsch - griechische U - Boot - Krieg
Auch die drei U - Boote , die in den Hellenic Shipyards in Griechenland gebaut wurden , sind bis heute noch nicht an die griechische Marine übergeben worden .
Während die Griechen Qualitätsdefizite anführen , ist der Hersteller ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems ( TKMS ) davon überzeugt , die griechischen Beschwerden seien einzig und allein Versuche , den Kaufpreis im Nachhinein zu drücken .
Um die U - Boote zu übernehmen , müsste der griechische Staat seine Verbindlichkeiten in Höhe von 520 Millionen Euro bei TKMS und Hellenic Shipyards bedienen .
Dieses
Geld hatte Griechenland aber offensichtlich aber nicht .
Im Herbst letzten Jahres riss TKMS dann der Geduldsfaden .
Die Hamburger lösten die Verträge mit Hinweis auf die ausstehenden Zahlungen und stellten ihre Transfers an die Hellenic Shipyards ein .
Dem Traditionsunternehmen mit 1.400 Mitarbeitern drohte schließlich das Aus , als auch die griechische Regierung sich weigerte , eine weitere Bürgschaft für Hellenic Shipyards abzugeben .
Wendepunkt Finanzkrise
Kaum drohte Griechenland die Zahlungsunfähigkeit , entspannte sich der deutsch - griechische U - Boot - Krieg auf wundersame Weise .
Während die EU ein Milliardenpaket für Athen schnürte , durchschlugen die Hellenen den gordischen Knoten : Man werde die Verpflichtungen bis auf den letzten Cent begleichen und die drei U - Boote , die in Griechenland gebaut wurden , übernehmen .
Die in Kiel gebaute Papanikolis werde man zwar ebenfalls übernehmen , aber weiterverkaufen .
Doch nicht nur das - Griechenland unterzeichnete im März 2010 sogar einen neuen Vertrag , in dem das Land sich verpflichtet , zwei weitere U - Boote vom Typ 214 bei den Hellenic Shipyards bauen zu lassen .
Während die griechische Regierung die Renten und die Löhne massiv kürzt , kauft sie zur gleichen Zeit deutsche Militärtechnik im Wert von über einer Milliarde Euro .
Es darf jedoch bezweifelt werden , dass diese Entscheidung in Athen getroffen wurde .
Sowohl griechische Regierungskreise als auch der Grünen - Europa - Abgeordnete Daniel Cohn - Bendit , der sich auf ein Gespräch mit dem griechischen Premier Papandreou beruft , berichten , dass die deutsche und die französische Regierung diese Waffendeals als Vorraussetzung für Konzessionen bei der Ausgestaltung des Rettungspakets gemacht haben .
Was für Deutschland seine U - Boote , sind für Frankreich seine Fregatten - Athen " will " in den nächsten Jahren sechs französische FREMM - Fregatten im Wert von 3,5 Milliarden Euro kaufen
Weißer Ritter aus dem Nahen Osten
Für Deutschland geht es bei dem U - Boot - Deal um weitaus mehr als 520 Millionen Euro aus Athen .
Die deutsche Schiffbaubranche steckt in einer tiefen Krise und es ist ungewiss , wie viele Arbeitsplätze in diesem Sektor im Land gehalten werden können .
Der Bau von Kriegsschiffen ist zwar hochprofitabel , aber die Deutsche Marine reicht als Exklusivkunde nicht aus , um über den militärischen Sektor den zivilen Sektor quersubventionieren zu können .
Finanzstarke Partner sind zwar vorhanden - ihr Interesse richtet sich jedoch vor allem auf den militärischen Sektor .
Das Griechenland - Paket wäre ohne Hilfe aus dem Golfemirat Abu Dhabi nicht möglich gewesen .
Der arabische Werftenkonzern Abu Dhabi Mar Group ( ADM ) ist der eigentliche Gewinner im deutsch - griechischen Streit .
ADM darf sich - trotz politischer Vorbehalte in der Vergangenheit - nun in einem Joint Venture an der militärischen Sparte von TKMS beteiligen .
Der Preis dafür ist hoch und vor allem politisch - ADM übernimmt nicht nur die Mehrheit des zu TKMS gehörenden , defizitären Zivilschiffbauers Blohm +
Voss , sondern auch einen 75 % - Anteil der vor der Insolvenz stehenden TKMS - Tochter Hellenic Shipyards .
Um die kriselnde Tochter nicht sofort abschreiben zu müssen , vereinbarte man in Hamburg und Abu Dhabi den Bau der zwei neuen U - Boote für die griechische Marine .
Woher das Geld dafür kommen soll ?
Den Unternehmen dürfte es egal sein , ob der griechische oder der deutsche Steuerzahler diesen Deal bezahlt .
Als Sahnehäubchen vergoldeten die Araber den Deal schließlich mit dem Auftrag für zwei neue Überwasserkriegsschiffe bei TKMS im Wert von 2,5 Milliarden Euro .
Submarine - Gap in der Ägäis
Griechenland und die Türkei sind mit 13 % und 15 % Marktanteil die größten Kunden deutscher Waffenexporteure .
Die deutsche Wirtschaft hat ein großes Interesse daran , dass dieser Konflikt stetig köchelt .
Als 1996 ein türkisches Schiff auf einer unbewohnten griechischen Insel auf Grund lief , führte dieser Zwischenfall beinahe zu einem Krieg .
Im selben Jahr startete Griechenland ein 17 - Milliarden - Euro - Programm zur Modernisierung seines Militärs .
2006 legte Griechenland einen neuen Rüstungsplan im Volumen von 40 Milliarden Euro auf .
Die deutschen Exporteure freut dies , zumal die Türken bei jeder griechischen Investition nachziehen .
Auch für die deutschen Werften ist dies ein todsicheres Geschäft .
Während den Griechen das Geld ausging , orderten die Türken ihrerseits sechs deutsche U - Boote vom Typ 214 , deren Kernkomponenten in Deutschland gefertigt werden und die im türkischen Gölcük Naval Shipyard zusammengesetzt werden .
Auslieferungsdatum ist das Jahr 2015 , der Auftrag hat ein Volumen von 2,5 Milliarden Euro .
Auf beiden Seiten mehren sich die Stimmen , die eine Friedensdividende für die beiden NATO - Partner einfordern :
Ein Grund für die Wirtschaftskrise in Griechenland ist der Versuch der Griechen , sich mit der Türkei bei den Verteidigungsausgaben einen Wettlauf zu liefern .
Sogar die Länder , die versuchen , Griechenland in diesen schweren Zeiten zu helfen , versuchen ihnen neue Rüstungsgüter zu verkaufen .
Griechenland braucht keine neuen Panzer , Raketen , U - Boote oder Kampfjets - auch die Türkei braucht diese Dinge nicht .
Es ist Zeit , die Militärausgaben weltweit zu kürzen - besonders gilt dies allerdings für die Türkei und für Griechenland .
Weder Griechenland noch die Türkei brauchen deutsche oder französische U - Boote .
Egemen Bagis - Chefunterhändler der Türkei bei den EU - Beitrittsverhandlungen
Sowohl in Griechenland als auch in der Türkei wird das deutsche Engagement für das griechische Militär daher auch äußerst kritisch bewertet , sieht man in der Finanzkrise doch die ideale Möglichkeit , aus dem selbstzerstörerischen Rüstungswettlauf auszusteigen .
Solange Griechenland von deutschen und französischen Hilfszusagen abhängig ist und die Türkei in die EU will , treffen derlei Stimmen der Vernunft jedoch auf taube Ohren .
Mit Rüstungsgütern lässt sich nun einmal sehr viel Geld verdienen - wen interessiert da der griechische oder gar der türkische Staatshaushalt .

For $ 49.99 come September , you 'll be able to get your hands on the normal retail version of Sid Meier 's Civilization V .
What do you get for $ 99.99 ?
Why , a plethora of Civilization related goodies that may or may not look good on your mantle , depending on the style , configuration , and existence of your mantle .
The bulk of that $ 50 likely goes to the five metal figurines from Reaper Miniatures , based on units from the game .
Each highly - detailed lump of metal is guaranteed to take up space somewhere in your home .

Next comes the 176 - page hardbound art book , which will look lovely on my book case and is the primary reason I will likely shell out the extra $ 50 myself .
What ?
I like video game art books .
Rounding out the special edition is a pair of soundtrack CDs and a " Behind - the - Scenes at Firaxis on Civilization V " DVD .
I do n't think I 've peeked at a behind - the - scenes DVD in the history of behind - the - scenes DVDs being packed in games , and I do n't see myself bucking that trend any time soon .
So is $ 50 a fair price to pay for a handful of metal figures and an art book ?
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The U.S. economy lost momentum in the second quarter , according to figures released Friday , which may raise concerns of an extended soft patch if not an outright contraction .
Real gross domestic product -- the inflation - adjusted , seasonally adjusted value of all goods and services produced in the U.S. -- rose at a 2.4 % annualized rate in the second quarter , well below the average 4.4 % increase over the past six months .
The 2.4 % increase in GDP was close to the 2.5 % expansion expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
However , the rate of expansion in the first quarter was revised up to a 3.7 % rise compared with the prior estimate of a 2.7 % increase .
Read full government release .
Economists say the growth was fairly strong in April and May but hit a rough patch in June .
So the economy is going into the second half with little momentum .
" The post - recession rebound is history , " said Bart van Ark , chief economist at the Conference Board .
" We do n't foresee a double dip , " he continued , " but we do expect growth to slow even more markedly " -- to what he pegged as a 1.6 % annualized rate for the second half of the year .

Stocks opened to the downside , but a report on stronger factory activity in the Midwest helped stocks recoup somewhat .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , +1.19 % was recently down 3 points to 10,462 .

Bond investors , confident that the coast remains clear as far as inflation goes , bought U.S. Treasurys as 2 - year - note yields sank to record lows .
See bond report .
Annual revisions released at the same time as the first estimate for second - quarter GDP show that the Great Recession was deeper than previously thought .
During the recession , real GDP decreased at a 2.8 % average rate , down from the prior estimate of a 2.5 % rate .
At the same time , the recovery , already one of the slowest , has been a bit slower .
From the third quarter of 2009 to the first quarter , the economy grew at a 3.4 % annual average rate , just below the previous estimate of a 3.5 % increase .
Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Markets , said the biggest surprise in the revisions was how much weaker than previously thought consumer spending was .
" The whole trajectory of consumer spending was taken down , " Gault said .
The savings rate rose to 6.2 % .
The weak job market and the debt hangover from the recession are causing consumers to be thrifty , he said .
There is also a lack of access to ready credit .
Growth in the third quarter is likely to be even slower than it was the April - June period , he said , and the door for a double - dip recession remains open .

Now that the revisions have been released , the National Bureau of Economic Research may move to make a formal call on the end of the recession .
Most economists think the recession ended in June 2009 .
Details
Although the increase in GDP in the quarter was not as strong as the one of the first quarter , many details of the report were positive .
Much of the deceleration was due to the trade sector .
Final sales , which exclude inventories , rose at a 1.3 % rate in the second quarter after rising 1.1 % in the first quarter .
Consumer spending slowed to an increase of 1.6 % after growing at a 1.9 % annual pace in the previous two quarters .
Consumer spending added 1.2 percentage points to GDP .
Spending on durable goods rose 7.5 % , spending on nondurable goods rose 1.6 % , and spending on services increased 0.8 % .
Real disposable income rose 4.4 % .
Business investments rose at a 17 % annual rate in the second quarter after a 7.8 % gain in the first quarter .
Investments in structures rose 5.2 % , and investments in equipment and software rose at a 21.9 % pace .
Business fixed investment added 1.5 percentage points to growth .
Inventories increased by $ 75.7 billion .
The change in inventories added 1.1 percentage points to growth .
Investments in housing increased at a 27.9 % annual rate after falling for the last two quarters .
Residential investments added 0.6 percentage point to growth .
Imports grew at a much faster pace the exports during the second quarter .
Exports rose at a 10.3 % rate .
Imports soared at a 28.2 % clip , the most in 34 years , as U.S. consumers and businesses stopped buying .
Net exports subtracted 2.8 percentage points from growth as the trade gap widened .
Imports had a record negative contribution to quarterly GDP .
Final sales to domestic purchasers -- a measure of domestic demand -- rose 4.2 % after rising 3.5 % in the first quarter .
Government spending rose at a 4.4 % annual pace after a 1.6 % drop in the first quarter .
Spending by state and local governments rose 1.3 % .
Federal spending rose 9.2 % .
Government spending added 0.9 percentage point to growth .
The price index for domestic purchases ( prices paid by U.S. residents ) rose 0.1 % in the quarter .
Consumer prices also rose 0.1 % , while core consumer prices ( which exclude food and energy ) rose 1.1 % .
In current dollar terms , GDP rose 4.1 % to an annual rate of $ 1.23 trillion .
There was a flurry of other reports Friday .
The Labor Department reported that the employment - cost index rose 0.5 % in the second quarter , in line with market expectations .
The gain was seen as good news .
Usually the ECI is watched carefully for signs of inflation but economists are now examining it for signs of deflation and declining wages .
Also , the University of Michigan and Reuters reported that consumer sentiment was softer in July compared with the prior month .

The Chicago Purchasing Managers index surprised analysts by showing a healthy increase in July .
This gain eased some of the gloom from the GDP data .
We can celebrate another victory for skeptics and reality !
The antivax group Australian Vaccination Network has been found to give " misleading and inaccurate information " to its followers , according to an Australian government investigation .
The investigation also concluded that despite their many denials , the AVN is in fact an antivaccination group and must make that clear when disseminating information .
Ouch .
The entire report can be downloaded here from the Antivaxxers.com website .
Here 's the background : Meryl Dorey is the head of the AVN .
She travels across Australia talking about the dangers of vaccination , and by " talking about " I really mean spewing misinformation .
She says things that are not correct , cherry picks data , misrepresents scientific studies , and basically distorts reality in order to push her propaganda about vaccines .
Given that vaccinations do work , are almost entirely safe , and have almost eliminated such diseases as pertussis , measles , polio , and smallpox , some reality - based people have taken exception to Ms. Dorey 's tactics .
That included Ken McLeod , who filed a complaint about Dorey and the AVN with the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission ( HCCC ) .
There were two thrusts to the complaint : one was that the AVN is a health care service provider , because they dispense health care advice , and second that the way they dispense that advice is misleading and harmful .
The HCCC agreed on both points .
First , they concluded that :
According to its own constitution and through its activities the AVN is a health education service .
I found it bizarre that Dorey would try to deny that ( it was a classic " who me ? " denial on her part ) .
She 's trying to eat her cake and have it , too ; dispense health care advice but then deny any responsibility for what happens when she does .
The second part is where the AVN and Dorey get handed their heads .
The HCCC report goes on for page after page listing out the breaches by Dorey and the AVN , showing where they have distorted and misrepresented vaccination information , all in a biased , negative way ( keep in mind that Dorey has vehemently claimed the AVN is not antivax ) .
For example , the report points out things like :
The AVN 's claims that vaccines are untested is simply false ;
The AVN 's claims about toxic substances in vaccinations are exaggerated and in some cases simply wrong ;
The AVN 's claims that vaccines are contaminated with viruses is cherry - picked in order to support an antivax stance ;
The AVNs claims that vaccines do not necessarily protect against disease misrepresents the facts ;
and much more .
In the end , sadly , the HCCC wo n't punish the AVN for its falsehoods , but it has recommended they put up a prominent disclaimer on their home page stating that they are antivax , that the information provided by the AVN is not medical advice , and that a decision to vaccinate or not should be made after consulting an actual health care provider .
But have no doubt : this is a big win for skepticism and reality !
Dorey and the AVN were repeatedly slammed in this document , which is a litany of their transgressions .
While I have no doubt Dorey will continue to claim she is the victim of a pogrom by people trying to suppress information and all that -- and the rabidly antivax Age of Autism site has already called this whole thing fascism : yes , fascism , which does n't mean what they think it means -- the truth is , Ms. Dorey and the AVN are guilty of spreading false , slanted information in order to spread their vicious antivax nonsense .
Ken Mcleod , who filed the suit in the first place , has issued a public statement about the report that 's well worth reading , too .
And remember , while Dorey and the AVN place themselves up on pedestals , there 's a pertussis outbreak in Marin County , California , another in Bakersfield , California , and similar reports from around the planet .
The bottom line is that mouthpieces for antivax propaganda distort reality , spread falsehoods , and consistently use fear as a tactic to spread their nonsense .
This comes at a great cost : more disease , more disregard for reality , and literally more cost as money has to be spent caring for sick patients .
I 'm glad that more people are taking this health threat seriously , and very glad for this victory against the antivaxxers .
Keep 'em coming !

In the last three months of 2009 , according to the federal Ministry of Finance in Moscow , Russia exported about 250,000 carats of rough diamonds , produced by Alrosa , to the west African republic of Guinea .
There is no known diamond cutting or polishing facility in Guinea , and Russia has never exported diamonds to Guinea before .
However , illicit sales of diamonds ( aka blood diamonds , conflict diamonds ) have been reported as using Guinea as a transit point between the mines in Africa and the markets in Israel , Europe , the US , or elsewhere .
The Finance Ministry in Moscow supervises the diamond sector and the state stockpile ; its minister , Alexei Kudrin , is chairman of the board of Alrosa .
The ministry is also in charge of monitoring compliance with the Kimberley Process for certificating diamond trading that does not involve diamonds mined illegally .
As part of Russia ’s compliance , the ministry issues regular reports on Russian exports .
The latest report covers 2009 .
It indicates that a total of 14.708 million carats were exported , for a declared value of $ 1.229 billion .
Almost all of these stones were sold by Alrosa .
Alrosa also sold 14 million carats of its production to the state stockpile agency , Gokhran , during the year .
The impact of the autumn 2008 global financial crisis shows in the near - halt of diamond exports from Russia in the first quarter .
Just 135,597 carats were exported , according to the Finance Ministry report , worth $ 724,000 .
Compared to the same quarter of 2008 , when shipments of 6,649,000 carats were recorded , in volume terms the export flow fell 49 times .
In the second quarter of 2009 , Russia reports exporting 2,713,000 carats , at a value of almost $ 30 million .
Most of the trade went to Belgium ( 2,016,000 carats ) , followed by Israel ( 253,658 carats ) .
In the third quarter , as Alrosa ’s marketing found new buyers , growing demand , and rising prices , the exports reached 5,334,000 carats , worth $ 540.9 million .
In the fourth quarter , the export volume rose again to 6,525,000 carats , at a value of 656 million .
Belgium accounted for 73 % of the goods ; India for 19 % .

According to the information released by the Finance Ministry , Guinea was the reported destination for shipments of rough in the fourth quarter ; the charts show volume of about 250,000 carats for a value of $ 50 million .
Ararat Evoyan , head of the Russian Association of Diamond Manufacturers , told Polished Prices.com , the reported trade is difficult to explain .
“ It sounds very strange .
Maybe someone in Guinea buys Russian diamonds to mix them with their production and export further .
Maybe Guinea is just a mid-way point for exports .
I do n’t really know , and it ’s difficult to say that for sure . ”
Another well - known Russian diamantaire said he suspects a recording or reporting mistake .
“ I would explain the Guinean exports as a technical Customs mistake or the effect of company registration particulars .
A buyer could be registered in Guinea , but actually be located in India , for example .
I do n’t think the issue of re-export could be involved , because the re-exporter would have to pay the 6.5 % tax , and nobody wants that . ”
The Finance Ministry and Alrosa were asked to clarify the details of the Guinean sale .
No response from the ministry has been received to date .
Alrosa responded : “ We have never exported diamonds to Guinea ” .
Guinea ’s Minister of Mining , Mahmoud Thiam , said : “ It ’s the first time I hear of this [ Russian ] diamond business and it does not make much sense to me .
Diamond exports from Guinea are free and happen on a regular basis .
All the exporters need to do is have their stones inspected , valued and certified by the Central Bank , pay their 3 % tax , and they are free to sell .
The government does not mine or sell itself .
So there is very little room for games . ”
Three separate shootings left 10 people wounded and scattered hundreds in downtown Indianapolis during the crowded Indiana
Black Expo , police said early Sunday .
Police spokesman Lt. Jeff Duhamell said authorities made no immediate arrests directly tied to the shootings and investigators
were seeking leads to the suspects .
None of the victims ' injuries were life - threatening , Duhamell told The Associated Press , adding police had made three
unrelated arrests on weapons charges .
The shooting began when several shots rang out around 9:30 p.m. Saturday near Circle Centre mall , leaving eight people wounded
and sending people running , Duhamell said .
He said a second shooting occurred nearby just minutes after the initial shooting and left one young man wounded .
He added
that the third shooting occurred around 11:30 p.m. and left another man wounded .
Duhamell said the shooting victims were all males between 10 and 18 years old .
He said most were taken to two area hospitals
where they were in good condition early Sunday .
One person was treated at the scene .
Authorities say none of the shootings occurred at venues playing host to Black Expo activities , but police patrolling amid
the crowd moving about the downtown area quickly converged on the scene .
" It 's pretty unusual to have this many shots in one time .
It 's very unfortunate , " Duhamell said .
Duhamell said investigators had no immediate report on a possible motive but were trying to determine if any of the shootings
were gang - related .
He said hundreds of officers had been assigned to policing the 10 - day event , which concludes later Sunday .
Julian Assange , Daniel Ellsburg and Nic Robertson discussed “ The Afghanistan War Logs ” leak , Monday evening .
Part One ( 7:16 ) :
Part Two ( 5:33 ) :
Part Three ( 5:23 ) :
The founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange , discussed the whistleblowing site ’s most recent leak of over 90,000 U.S. military records on “ Larry King Live ” at CNN , Monday evening .
Sunday evening , The New York Times ( NYT ) , the London Guardian and German weekly Der Spiegel revealed WikiLeaks granted them access to the documents spanning from 2004 - 09 .
It is being called the largest leak since Daniel Ellsburg leaked the Pentagon Papers , which exposed U.S. government secrets of its war in Vietnam .
Mr. Assange , earlier today , said the leak exposes “ evidence of war crimes ” committed by the U.S. - led coalition under the Bush and Obama Administrations .
Mr. Ellsburg later joined the broadcast in support of WikiLeaks .
Nic Robertson , senior correspondent at CNN International , referenced an intelligence source saying the leak is “ old bad news in a new bad time ” — mainly of Pakistan intelligence puppeteering the Afghan militant resistance networks .
Later in the episode , Mr. Ellsburg remained to participate in a panel discussion with former NATO Europe Supreme Allied Commander and retired U.S. General Wesley Clark , former military intelligence officer and fellow whistleblower Anthony Shaffer and Rolling Stone contributing editor Michael Hastings — whose recent exposé of the counterinsurgency doctrine in Afghanistan displayed its only foreseeable result as “ perpetual war “ .
In response to the common red herring question as to WikiLeaks ’ being ‘ allowed ’ to leak documents , Mr. Assange responded to a reporter at an afternoon London press conference :
Well , it ’s a matter about whether the coercive power of the state should be used to stop people sharing information , who have no direct connection to the source of the information .
You ca n’t use the coercive power of the state to stop people spreading rumors , to stop people discussing political life , and sophisticated U.S. jurisprudence understands that .
And that is why you have things like the First Amendment , which takes the press outside the legislative process , because in the end it is the communication of knowledge which regulates the legislature , which creates the Constitution .
Earlier in the day at Democracy Now ! , Rick Rowley — an independent journalist with Big Noise Films who just returned from a trip to Afghanistan , embedded with a division in the extended Marja Surge — summarized the progression of Washington ’s mission toward a secret war of extrajudicial assassinations , night raids and mass kidnapping :
Well , I mean , what these documents show — prove — is that the U.S. military has been whitewashing the war in Afghanistan for years and that most of the media has been along for the ride .
They ’ve systematically covered up civilian casualties .
They ’ve covered up the successful attacks by the Taliban and their significance .
And they ’ve covered up the violent criminality of the security forces that we ’ve created there , security forces that are preying on Afghan civilians .
I mean , the picture that emerges from these documents is , on the one hand , of an insurgency that is resilient and adapting and that is winning the war on the ground , and , on the other hand , of an Afghan state that we ’ve constructed there that looks less like a government and looks more like a patchwork of warlords and criminal gangs that ’s extorting the local population and that has become more hated in many parts of the country than the Taliban who they replaced .
A third interesting thing that these documents do is they put flesh on a process that we ’ve been tracking , along with reporters like Jeremy Scahill , for some time , of a transition to what some people call a special forces war , an entirely covert and classified war that ’s conducted with drone strikes and midnight raids and targeted assassinations , where everything is classified , there are no media embeds , and there ’s very little accountability .
I mean , I think that is the trajectory that this war is taking right now .
Now , the White House has responded .
They have n’t denied anything here .
They have n’t even denied the conclusions that people are drawing about how terrible the war has been there .
Their response has been that this is old news , we knew about this a long time ago , and that , in fact , Obama ’s war , Obama ’s surge , the new war that began in December 2009 , has changed everything .
Well , I came back from Afghanistan ten days ago .
And while I was embedded with the Marines in Marja and elsewhere in the country , I can tell you that this picture matches perfectly with what ’s going on on the ground there right now .
In Marja , which was supposed to be the poster child of this new campaign , Marja — you know , it ’s a small farming community where two Marine divisions were sent in to try to prove that this war was still winnable .
Those two Marine divisions have been pinned down for months .
We were there at the beginning of an operation called Operation Cobra that was sending in reinforcements , a couple extra Marine companies , to try to , you know , push out their security perimeter .
But it ’s the —Obama ’s surge has completely derailed .
They have n’t brought security to Marjah .
They have one to three kilometers of security around their forward operating bases .
And the biggest disaster is that the government that they were — that they ’ve brought in and tried to stand up , the famous government in a box that was going to roll out right after the Marines cleared the ground , has disappeared .
The officials refused to deploy from Kabul and disappeared .
Only the mayor comes in , Mayor Haji Zahir , who ’s brought in by helicopter by the Marines and , like , set down in the middle of shuras and meetings that they set up and then bundled back into a helicopter and flown out .
And this guy , Haji Zahir , he ’s an expat who lived in Germany for years and spent five years in jail for attempted murder in Germany .
I mean , that ’s the caliber of people who we ’ve brought in to make the leaders of this new — of the Afghanistan that we ’re building .
I mean , it is an abject failure , as far as a nation - building operation on the ground .
And , you know , whether you ’re talking about the last ten years of the war or 2010 , I mean , the picture does n’t change .
Gareth Porter , investigative journalist at Inter Press Services and scholar on geopolitics , highlighted the confirmation of Pak intel ’s role in the insurgency as “ the most politically salient issue ” .
As for general rundowns of media and White House reaction , the NYT ’s “ At War ” blog , Greg Mitchell at his Nation blog and Andrew Sullivan at his Atlantic blog put together solid rundowns , if one is so compelled , but beware — as there ’s plenty of premature hyperbole yelled around .
David Cameron today ordered an unprecedented inquiry into evidence and allegations of British complicity in the torture and abuse of terror suspects .
But he immediately moved to ensure the courts would no longer be able to disclose damning evidence which , he implied , could jeopardise intelligence sharing with the US .
Honouring a promise while in opposition that he would set up a judge - led inquiry into mounting evidence , emerging mainly from court hearings , the prime minister told the Commons he had asked Sir Peter Gibson – a former appeal court judge who privately monitors the activities of the intelligence agencies – to " look at whether Britain was implicated in the improper treatment of detainees held by other countries that may have occurred in the aftermath of 9/11 " .
He said that while there was no evidence that any British officer was " directly engaged in torture " in the aftermath of 9/11 there were " questions over the degree to which British officers were working with foreign security services who were treating detainees in ways they should not have done " .
Though he did not point directly to a particular case , he made clear he was referring to evidence disclosed by the high court that MI5 knew about the abuse of Binyam Mohamed , a British resident held incognito in Pakistan in 2002 before being secretly rendered to jails in Morocco , Afghanistan , and Guantánamo Bay .
In rulings highly critical of government officials , a string of senior judges ruled this year that CIA information showing MI5 involvement in abuse should be disclosed .
The US made it clear it was appalled and suggested it would cut off intelligence sharing with the UK .
To prevent any repeat of such disclosures , Cameron told MPs the government intended to publish a green paper setting out " proposals for how intelligence is treated in the full range of judicial proceedings , including addressing the concerns of our allies " .
Government officials made clear ministers are seeking legislation that would in future prevent judges release information passed to MI5 by the CIA or by any other foreign intelligence agency .
He said the government wanted to pursue " mediation " with six former Guantánamo Bay detainees who had brought civil claims about their treatment – and who are demanding the disclosure of MI5 and MI6 intelligence .
They will be offered out - of - court compensation .
The inquiry by Gibson , who will be assisted by Dame Janet Paraskeva , head of the civil service commissioners , and Peter Riddell , the former Times journalist and fellow of the Institute of Government , will not be able to summon foreign witnesses or compel former Labour ministers to testify .
However , the inquiry has the freedom to investigate the policies that underpinned MI5 and MI6 conduct .
Critically , it could allow the inquiry to identify the government ministers who authorised those policies .
Widespread support for the inquiry was expressed , qualified by concern over the degree of secrecy that will surround it , and over its inability to compel former ministers to appear .
There was also concern that the government 's new interrogation guidelines for British intelligence officers – published after being recently rewritten – contained a number of loopholes that could still lead to it being used to facilitate torture .
Andrew Tyrie , a backbench Tory MP who has been campaigning for an inquiry for several years , said : " The prime minister 's courageous decision to hold a judge - led inquiry , and to set aside a number of objections that will have been put to him , is a huge step forward .
It can give the public confidence that the truth on British involvement in rendition will come out . "
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said : " An inquiry into British complicity in torture is welcome and overdue but this announcement leaves room for fears that government is bending towards the security establishment .
" They would n't be in this mess but for all the excuses for secret stitch - ups instead of open justice .
This inquiry can only be credible with the broadest remit , the most public proceedings possible and by full engagement with victims , witnesses and lawyers .
Any attempt to exempt intelligence from legal scrutiny is an attempt to exempt the security services from the rule of law . "

IT TOOK a while but Europe 's committee of bank supervisors has finally agreed on some basic criteria that should be applied in a series of co-ordinated tests of the ability of the region 's biggest banks to withstand a downturn .
The idea of testing banks ' ability to withstand various scary scenarios is a sensible one .
There is still some debate as to how much to credit the stress tests carried out in America for restoring trust in its biggest banks , but few people think they were a bad idea .
Their big advantage is that they can help to address a fundamental flaw in the financial system : namely that it is difficult for outsiders to assess the health of a bank .
In such circumstances it makes a lot of sense to invite outside examiners to rummage about in filing cabinets and ask difficult “ what if ” questions .
The trouble , however , is that stress tests only restore confidence if the questions are tough enough to be realistic but not so tough that too many banks fail them .
They have to reassure markets that banks will survive not just the most likely of scenarios but also slightly less likely but still possible ones .
There is also a danger , however , in setting the bar too high , for markets would also be unnerved if many banks were to fail their tests .
In America a reasonable balance could be found because markets were providing some indication of expected defaults and losses on toxic assets .
In the case of Europe the issue is complicated by market interventions and politics .
It is clear that the tests have to somehow take into account the possibility that one or more European countries may default on their debts .
These may not be likely outcomes , but they are possibilities that have the markets on edge .
Yet there is great reluctance across all European institutions to explore explicitly such a possibility .
Instead the committee of bank supervisors has suggested applying a discount , or “ haircut ” , to some European bonds that is supposedly based on market expectations of default .
Yet because the European Central Bank is buying sovereign debt to help prop up prices , markets are not giving a clear indication of expected loss levels .
As it stands the tests seem unlikely to offer much reassurance on the consequences for banks of one or more sovereign defaults .
Without answers to that question , there seems little point then in doing the tests .

" Prima , jetzt können wir einsteigen .
Jawoll . "
Die Schachtanlage von Herfa - Neurode .
Ein paar Hundert Meter unter unseren Füßen ein Salzbergwerk der K+S AG .
In einem abgebauten Grubenteil befindet sich eine von fünf deutschen Untertagedeponien für hochgiftigen Chemiemüll .
Es ist die größte der Welt .
" Das hier ist ein Frischwetterschacht .
Hier ziehen 16.000 Kubikmeter in jeder Minute in die Grube .
Davon haben wir mehrere Schächte .
Sieben insgesamt .
Teil einziehend , Teil ausziehend . "
Dort unten ruhen mehr als 2,7 Millionen Tonnen " gefährlicher Abfälle " : Stoffe , die so stark mit Giften belastet sind , dass sie tief unter der Erde begraben werden .
" In dem Fall , Herfa - Neurode , haben wir eine Doppelschachtanlage .
Wir sind durch den Schacht Herfa eingefahren , und die Abwetter ziehen 200 Meter weiter entfernt durch den Schacht Neurode aus .
Daher der Name Herfa - Neurode . "
In Herfa - Neurode endet , was die Industriegesellschaft für ihren täglichen Verbrauch an gefährlichen Hinterlassenschaften produziert : inzwischen auf einer Fläche , in die München samt Autobahnring passen würde .
Und täglich werden es um die 300 Tonnen mehr .
Hier landet Sondermüll aus ganz Europa .
Aber es sind auch schon Stoffe aus den USA eingelagert worden , und aus China gibt es Anfragen .
" Hier kann man alle Sünden unserer Gesellschaft finden . "
70.000 Sünden in 70.000 Fläschchen .
" Hier , gelb , schwefelhaltige Abfälle , die grauen sind in der Regel Filterstäube aus der Rauchgasreinigung . "
Der Probenrückstellraum der Untertage - Deponie in Herfa - Neurode , 730 Meter unter der Erde :
" Jedes Glas ist beschriftet , und zwar mit der Codebezeichnung , dem Liefertermin und einer fortlaufenden Nummer von jedem Jahr .
Auf der Basis kann man den Abfall genau zuordnen . "
Was immer die Eingangskontrollen besteht und angenommen wird : ein wenig davon wird in Fläschchen gefüllt und in die Metallregale sortiert :
" Viele nennen unser Lager hier auch das Gedächtnis der Deponie . "
Gerold Jahn von der K+S Entsorgung holt ein Fläschchen nach dem anderen heraus .
Er ist der Leiter der Untertage - Deponie und der Verwertungsanlage in Herfa - Neurode .
Seit 1972 füllt der in Fässern und Säcken verpackte Giftmüll Hohlräume , die der Salzbergbau zurückgelassen hat .
1997 wurde das dritte Deponiefeld genehmigt .
Mit Cyaniden belastete Stoffe landen hier , mit Quecksilber , Arsen , polychlorierten Biphenylen , mit Furanen oder Dioxinen .
Die Gifte stecken - mehr oder weniger konzentriert - in Filterstäuben von Müllverbrennungsanlagen , in kontaminierten Böden oder Mauern , in Härtesalzrückständen der Metallindustrie , im Leuchtstoffröhrenbruch .
Würden die Gifte isoliert , reichten sie für den vielfachen Overkill der Menschheit .
Jahn :
" Hier haben wir eine Altlast der ehemaligen DDR .
Das sind also Pestizide , die in Rumänien in einem Zug auf einem Bahnhof gefunden wurden .
Und nach der Wende mussten die ordnungsgemäß entsorgt werden .
Und die Bundesregierung hat das in Auftrag gegeben und die Einlagerung hier in die Untertagedeponie angewiesen . "
Das Salz von Herfa - Neurode liegt wie eine Decke im Untergrund .
Mehr als 250 Millionen Jahre ist es her , dass es aus einem flachen Meer rieselte : Das Klima war heiß , und der Boden sank langsam , aber stetig ab .
So sammelte sich eine Hunderte von Metern mächtige Salzabfolge an , erklärt Stefan Alt vom Ökoinstitut in Darmstadt :
" Das Bergwerk sitzt ungefähr in der Mitte .
Nach oben hin wird diese Salzschicht noch von einer Tonschicht abgedeckt , und damit wird verhindert , dass das Salz direkt mit Grundwasser in Kontakt kommt .
Das ist ja ein ganz wichtiger Punkt , dass man langfristig damit rechnen kann , dass das Salz dort , wo es ist , auch bleibt und nicht aufgelöst wird oder sich anderweitig bewegt . "
Das Salz soll die hochgiftigen Stoffe , die die Industriegesellschaft tagtäglich anhäuft , für immer " wegsperren " , Mensch und Umwelt vor ihnen schützen : tief verbuddelt , fast aus der Welt – und auch aus dem Sinn .
Gerold Jahn :
" Hier Kondensatoren .
Die sind auch PCB - haltig . "
Gigantische Mengen giftiger Verbindungen entstehen jedes Jahr .
Sie durchlaufen Produktionsketten , werden benutzt , recycelt , entsorgt und dabei auch über Ländergrenzen hinweg gehandelt .
Wieviel davon letztlich die legalen
Wege verläßt , läßt sich laut Umweltbundesamt nicht abschätzen .
Exakt dokumentiert hingegen ist , was in den deutschen Untertagedeponien landet .
Es sind Stoffe , die sich wirtschaftlich nicht anders behandeln lassen - insgesamt etwa 300.000 Tonnen pro Jahr .
Das Wort " Endlager " hört man übrigens bei der K+S Entsorgung ungern - schließlich gibt es die Option " Rückholung " :
Als Kupfer als Rohstoff teuer wurde , ließen Firmen ihre Transformatoren für viel Geld wieder ausgraben , reinigten sie von den PCB - Resten und verkauften sie dann .
Entsorgung ist immer auch eine Kostenfrage .
Jahn :
" Wir durften und konnten schon wieder etwas herausholen .
Und zwar wenn ein Inhaltsstoff abfallwirtschaftlich wieder interessant wird , aufgrund der gestiegenen Rohstoffpreise zum Beispiel : Dann bekommen wir eine Anfrage , ob wir diesen Abfall wieder nach oben bringen können . "
Bad Hersfeld .
Ein nüchterner Zweckbau am Rand der Altstadt , zwischen Supermärkten und Einfamilienhäusern .
Hier hat das Kasseler Regierungspräsidium eine Zweigstelle , die unter anderem die Bergaufsicht über die Gruben der Region ausübt .
Als die Untertagedeponie Herfa - Neurode in Betrieb ging , war Bad Hersfeld abgeschiedenes Zonenrandgebiet .
Tiefste Provinz ist die Stadt immer noch , auch wenn sie heute mitten in Deutschland liegt .
Es ist schon bemerkenswert : Beim Atommüll sind Bundesministerien und Bundesforschungsinstitute gefragt – doch in Sachen Giftmüll reichen die unteren Instanzen : Informationen gibt es auf Ebene des Regierungspräsidiums .
" Im Jahr 1972 ist der damalige Bergwerksbetreiber auf die Idee kommen , er gehörte zum BASF - Konzern , in einem Betriebsteil , der ein wenig abgeschlossen vom übrigen Grubenbetrieb gewesen ist , Rückstände aus der chemischen Industrie , sprich von der Mutter BASF , abzulagern . "
Der Blick in die alten Akten gleicht einer Zeitreise in die 1970er .
Damals formierte sich die Ökologiebewegung .
Umweltschutz wurde zum Thema :
Es ging um stinkende , verdreckte Flüsse , um Luftverschmutzung , Atomkraft .
Bürgerinitiativen schossen aus dem Boden .
Für sie gab es viel zu tun .
Auch beim Giftmüll : Der landete oft in den vielen wilden Deponien .
50.000 oder mehr soll es gegeben haben :
" Das ist die erste und ursprüngliche Genehmigung . "
Im Büro von Udo Selle steht ein mobiles Regal mit etwa zweieinhalb Metern Akten zu Herfa - Neurode : die Genehmigungsunterlagen seit 1972 .
1972 war die ehemalige Kaligrube die erste Untertage - Deponie weltweit , erklärt der Bergbaudirektor :
" Das ist der Antrag der Kali und Salz AG , so der damalige Firmenname , an das Bergamt Bad Hersfeld über die Einlagerung von Abfallprodukten aus der chemischen Industrie .
Umfang : anderthalb Seiten und die dazugehörige Betriebszulassung des Bergamtes mit insgesamt zwölf Nebenbestimmungen , auch vom Umfang her zwei Seiten . "
Ein übersichtliches Verfahren für ein Problem , das auf den Nägeln brannte .
Die Ausführungen sind knapp .
Etwa die Sicherheitsbetrachtung zum Eindringen von Wasser :
Dabei entstehen gesättigte Laugen , die stagnieren und eine weitergehende Zirkulation der eindringenden Wässer und damit einen Transport von eingelagertem
Gut weitgehend ausschließen .
Hierzu sind im Falle des Salzbergwerks Asse II zahlreiche Untersuchungen durchgeführt worden .
Ironie der Geschichte : Das inzwischen berüchtigte Atommüll - Endlager Asse lieferte seinerzeit Argumente für die Beherrschbarkeit des schlimmsten , aber durchaus möglichen Unfalls in einer Untertagedeponie - des Wassereinbruchs über den Schacht :
Nach Dieffenbacher und anderen , 1971 , besteht für das Salzbergwerk Asse II , in dem radioaktive Abfälle eingelagert werden , selbst bei dem äußerst unwahrscheinlichen Eintreten eines Wassereinbruchs keinerlei Gefährdung für die Umwelt , auch nicht auf lange Sicht .
Heute droht die Asse abzusaufen - samt der 126.000 Fässer radioaktiven Mülls , die dort eingelagert sind : Der Salzbergbau war dem Rand des Salzstocks
Asse zu nahe gekommen , so dass seit Jahren Wasser eindringt .
Damals jedoch schien die Welt in Ordnung zu sein .
Selle :
" Dann schließt diese gutachterliche Stellungnahme mit einer Beurteilung ab , die vom Tenor her sagt : Durch den vorgesehenen Betrieb einer Deponie im Kaliwerk Herfa - Neurode ist eine schädliche Beeinflussung der Umwelt ausgeschlossen , da sich die abgelagerten Stoffe in einem rund 300 Meter mächtigen Steinsalzlager in über 800 Metern Tiefe unter der Erdoberfläche nicht wieder in den Biozyklus gelangen können , und dem normalen hydrologischen Kreislauf entzogen sind . "
Firmen und Gesellschaft hatten ein Problem weniger .
" Die Genehmigungsverfahren für Chemieabfälle , die im wesentlichen in den siebziger Jahren entstanden sind , gingen noch davon aus , dass das mit relativer Einfachheit und Schlichtheit dann auch zu bewältigen ist . "
Ortwin Renn lehrt als Umwelt - und Techniksoziologe an der Universität Stuttgart .
Vorschriften , wie man hochtoxischen Abfall sicher unterbringt , gab es nicht , erzählt er. Deshalb setzte sich ein kleiner Kreis von Experten der Kali und Salz und des Hessischen Landesamts für Geologie zusammen .
Sie wälzten Unterlagen , debattierten aufgrund bergmännischer und geologischer Erfahrung : Herfa - Neurode wurde zur Pilotanlage für die untertägige Deponierung hochtoxischer Abfälle .
Stefan Alt :
" Sämtliche Verfahren , sämtliche Techniken sind dort entwickelt worden .
Auch die Nachweise , die gegenüber der Genehmigungsbehörde zu erbringen sind , sind dort entwickelt worden . "
Etwa beim Sicherheitsnachweis , für den inzwischen ein fester Katalog an " Ereignissen " geprüft wird :
" Dazu gehören Erdbeben , dazu gehört Vulkanismus . "
Denn als die Vulkane der nahen Rhön ausbrachen , schickten sie Ausläufer ins Salz von Herfa - Neurode .
Die schleppten große Mengen an vulkanischem Kohlendioxid an .
Alt :
" Die Tatsache , dass es heute noch dort ist , wird im Nachweis angeführt als Argument dafür , dass die Salzformationen sogar gasförmige Stoffe sicher und langfristig zurückhalten können , weil : Auch dieses Kohlendioxid liegt mittlerweile schon seit 20 Millionen Jahren dort . "
Unter anderem deswegen und wegen seiner Fähigkeit , um alles herumzukriechen , galt Salz vielen Experten als bestes Wirtsgestein für ein Endlager .
Was die Menschheit heute an Giftmüll produziert , ist beträchtlich : Weltweit geht es um 400 Millionen Tonnen .
Allein in Deutschland sind es mindestens 18 Millionen Tonnen .
Laut Gesetz müssen gefährlichen Abfälle verwertet oder technisch " entschärft " werden .
Je nach Stoffkategorie enden sie in Sondermüllverbrennungsanlagen oder in obertägigen Deponien .
Was zu giftig ist , kommt nach Untertage .
Stefan Alt :
" Der einzige Ort , in den man derzeit das Vertrauen hat , dass man diese Abfälle langfristig und sicher vor der Biosphäre abschließen kann . "
Platz für diese " Reststoffe " gibt es in Herfa Neurode reichlich : Täglich holen die Bergleute 70.000 Tonnen Rohsalz heraus - als Ausgangsstoff für Düngemittel und chemische Industrie .
Zurück bleibt eine unterirdische Landschaft aus Stützpfeilern und Hohlräumen , und in die können auch in Zukunft chemotoxische Abfälle gesteckt werden .
Listenpreis pro Tonne : 260 Euro .
Das ist teuer , wenn auch nicht so teuer wie früher .
Die Preise sind gesunken .
Weil Strategien zur Abfallvermeidung und neue Behandlungsmethoden griffen , wird heute weniger eingelagert als vor 20 , 30 Jahren .
Aber alles lässt sich nicht behandeln .
Mit jeder Fahrt schleppt der Förderkorb sieben Tonnen nach unten : auf vier Etagen mit jeweils zwei Paletten voller 200 - Liter - Fässer oder Big Bags .
Das sind große Plastiksäcke mit Rückständen aus der Rauchgasreinigung oder Filterstäuben .
Jahr für Jahr landen über den Schacht weitere 200.000 Tonnen Sondermüll auf der 660 - Meter - Sohle .
Dort angekommen , warten die Gabelstapler .
Gerold Jahn :
" Die können gleichzeitig zwei Gebinde vom Förderkorb herunternehmen und auf dem Lkw abstellen .
Auf der Ladepritsche haben bis zu 16 Gebinde Platz . "
Ein mit Paletten voller Big Bags beladener Lastwagen fährt los .
Auch Gerold Jahn startet sein Auto .
Der Fahrtwind ist warm , könnte an einen Frühlingstag erinnern - wäre da nicht der Geruch : salzig wie am Meer , aber mit etwas Diesel darunter , Öl , ein Hauch Sprengschwaden - eben typisch Bergwerk .
Gerold Jahn beginnt zu erklären : Ins Salz dürfe längst nicht alles :
" Wir haben Ausschlusskriterien , also Abfälle , die nicht untertage eingelagert werden dürfen .
Also : Abfälle dürfen nicht brennbar sein , nicht leicht entzündlich , nicht hoch entzündlich , nicht selbst entzündlich .
Sie dürfen nicht ausgasend sein , nicht radioaktiv , sie dürfen keine Erreger pathogener Keime enthalten , sie dürfen nicht flüssig sein , flüssig deswegen , weil man früher flüssig mit Wasser definiert hat und Wasser ist ja der größte Feind des Salzbergmanns , weil Wasser kann Salz auflösen und das darf natürlich hier unten nicht passieren . "
Während in ausgebeuteten Betriebsteilen eingelagert wird , läuft in anderen die Förderung weiter .
Ein potentielles Risiko .
Udo Selle vom Regierungspräsidium Kassel :
" Das bedeutet natürlich , dass auch ständig neue Hohlräume geschaffen werden , dass Sicherheitspfeiler , die man festgelegt hat , möglicherweise durch die bergmännische Tätigkeit verletzt werden . "
Es müssen immer mindestens 50 Meter Salz zwischen der Deponie und dem Rest der Welt bleiben , also auch zum aktiven Grubenbereich .
Wo - wie an Verbindungsstrecken - dieser massive Sicherheitsgürtel fehlt , sollen Betondämme abschotten .
Seit 2009 verlangt die deutsche Deponieverordnung , dass die Überwachungsbehörden regelmäßig prüfen , ob alles noch in Ordnung ist , Genehmigung und Langzeitsicherheit Bestand haben .
Ein zentraler Punkt ist die Frage , ob der Bergbau nichts am sicheren Einschluss verändert hat .
Udo Selle :
" Während man im Jahre 1972 noch mit einem relativ kurzen Gutachten und einem kurzen Bescheid ausgekommen ist , hat der Langzeitsicherheitsnachweis heute einen Umfang von fast 200 Seiten Textteil , zu dem noch gewisse Anlagen und Gutachten dazugehören .
Das sind insgesamt drei Aktenorder , die nun auch - genau wie der Genehmigungsbestand - alle vier Jahre geprüft werden , an die Weiterentwicklung des Grubenbetriebs angepasst werden müssen , wo neue Erkenntnisse einfließen teilweise auch Änderungen der gesetzlichen Vorschriften . "
Wichtig dabei ist die Gefahr von Wassereinbrüchen – durch den Schacht oder weil ein Teil der Grube kollabiert .
Was würde bei einem solchen GAU passieren ?
Stefan Alt :
" Das ist ein sehr komplexes wissenschaftliches Feld , an dem auch die Datengrundlage noch lückenhaft ist .
Da wird sehr vehement dran gearbeitet , die zu verbessern . "
Etwa in den Laboratorien der Gesellschaft für Anlagen - und Reaktorsicherheit GRS .
Dort versucht Thomas Brasser die Zusammenhänge in einem Chemieendlager zu verstehen .
Klar ist , dass Wasser im Bergwerk sofort Unmengen an Salz löst und sich in eine hochgradig salzige Lösung verwandelt :
" Es sind dann extreme geochemische Bedingungen , die herrschen und die dann auch andere Reaktionen des Abfalls oder der Abfallinhaltsstoffe verursachen könnten . "
Jetzt kommt es darauf an , welcher Stoff unter diesen extremen Bedingungen mit welchem anderen Stoff wie reagiert :
" Es geht beispielsweise um Fragen der Löslichkeit .
Ganz viele Daten , die heute verfügbar sind , die beziehen sich auf Laborbedingungen und sind nicht ohne weiteres übertragbar auf Verhältnisse , wie man sie in einer Untertagedeponie hätte , wenn denn dort ein Zutritt von Flüssigkeiten stattfindet . "
Einfach nachvollziehen lässt sich das komplexe Geschehen nicht .
Brasser :
" Habe ich Abfälle unterschiedlichster Herkunft zusammen in einer Untertagedeponie , sind das nicht einzelne Elemente , sondern das ist ein Sammelsurium von Schadstoffen , die in ihrer komplexen Zusammensetzung durchaus ein anderes Verhalten zeigen können als das die Einzelkomponenten tun . "
Selbst wenn in der Lösung jeweils für sich die Gehalte an Blei , Cadmium oder Zink unterhalb der zulässigen Grenzwerte liegen , wirken sie gemeinsam dann doch giftig .
Brasser :
" Ein Kenntnisstand , der auf Laborergebnissen mit destilliertem Wasser und reinen Elementen beruht , ist nicht übertragbar auf einen konkreten Abfall , in dem verschiedene Schadstoffe enthalten sind plus eine hoch salinare Lösung .
Das sind ganz andere Welten . "
Welten , über die man wissenschaftlich bislang wenig weiß .
Wir fahren durch das Deponiefeld 2 .
Es ist fast vollständig verfüllt .
Die Abfälle werden nach Stoffgruppen getrennt eingelagert - durch eine Mauer abgeschottet oder durch einen Salzwall .
Gerold Jahn :
" Wir haben also verschiedene Stoffgruppen , nach denen wir die Abfälle sortieren .
Wir haben da saure organische Abfälle , cyanidhaltige Abfälle , alkalische Abfälle , saure Abfälle in Fässern , in big bags , wir trennen also auch immer nach den Gebinden . "
So soll verhindert werden , dass in den geschlossenen Kammern chemische Reaktionen ablaufen , wenn die Fässer und big bags zerstört sein werden – denn die halten nicht ewig .
Die Chemieabfälle bleiben aber auf ewig giftig .
Was bedeutet dann eigentlich " Langzeitsicherheit " ?
Kann man Sicherheit auf Dauer garantieren ?
Stefan Alt :
" Wir bewegen uns da natürlich in einem Bereich , wo es irgendwann einmal philosophisch wird , über Konsequenzen eigenen Handelns zu sprechen . "
Während beim Atommüll die Strahlung mit der Zeit abklingt , verändern sich Gifte niemals .
Für Atommüll - Endlager wird derzeit eine Million Jahre Sicherheit gefordert .
Bei chemotoxischen Abfällen dagegen gibt es solche Vorgaben nicht , erläutert Stefan Alt vom Öko - Institut Darmstadt :
" Einen Zeitraum festzulegen , über den ein Beweis geführt werden muss , ist für chemisch - toxische Abfälle weder möglich , noch sinnvoll , weil sich die Eigenschaften dieser Abfälle über den Zeitraum nicht verändern , und insofern , ja , die Konsequenz meines Handelns , indem ich diese Abfälle irgendwann einmal ja erzeugt und dann auch endgelagert habe , sich dadurch nicht ändern . "
Während beim Atommüll für den Nachweis der Langzeitsicherheit alle möglichen Szenarien erdacht und über eine Million Jahre hinweg simuliert werden , fordert der Gesetzgeber so etwas für Untertagedeponien nicht .
Bei ihnen läuft der Sicherheitsnachweis anders .
Alt :
" Szenarien werden betrachtet , werden allerdings auf eine Art und Weise betrachtet , die man verbal - argumentativ nennt , also man sucht Argumente zusammen , man beschreibt die Situation und man gewinnt einen Eindruck davon , wie sich qualitativ das System gegenüber diesem Einfluss verhält , sei es jetzt 1.000.000 Kubikmeter Grundwasser kommen in Kontakt mit der Deponie , was geschieht dann ? "
Anders als beim Atomendlager werden jedoch beispielsweise keine komplexen Modelle dazu durchgerechnet , wie sich ein mit Wasser mobilisierter Schadstoff ausbreiten würde , erläutert Stefan Alt :
" Den Betreiber wird man dort auch nicht unter Druck setzen wollen . "
Lange Zeit wusste man noch nicht einmal , wo eigentlich der Teil der ganz normalen Abwässer endet , der bei der Salzproduktion entsteht und der derzeit noch in den Untergrund verpresst wird .
Vor einigen Jahren stellte sich dann heraus , dass er es in die Flussbetten der Umgebung schafft .
Es ist wenig bekannt über die Wege des Wassers im Untergrund .
Wir fahren an einer Mauer mit einem Tor in der Mitte vorbei .
Normalerweise , so erläutert Gerold Jahn , werde ein Hohlraum erst mit Abfallgebinden gefüllt und dann zugemauert .
Hier sei es umgekehrt .
Die Mauern kämen zuerst – des Brandschutzes wegen .
Denn hier würden big bags eingelagert , die nicht in sich selbst standfest sind und deshalb auf ihren Holzpaletten bleiben .
Das erhöhe die Brandgefahr .
Jahn :
" Diese sogenannte Kammer wird zwangsbelüftet .
Am hinteren Ende befindet sich ein Ventilator , der die Luft über das Tor in die Kammer hineinzieht , und zusätzlich ist dort am Kammerausgang eine Kohlenmonoxid - Mess - Sonde angebracht , dass - falls es zum Brand käme - ein Alarm ausgelöst würde .
Und dann kann man den Lüfter abschalten , mit einer Klappe verschließen und das Tor schließen , so dass ein Brand erstickt werden könnte . "
Überhaupt könne die ganze Deponie versiegelt werden :
" Hier fahren wir durch eine Wetterschleuse durch .
Hier können wir die Tore schließen und die Deponie hermetisch abriegeln . "
Wie wichtig diese Sicherheitsmaßnahme im Ernstfall sein kann , erfuhr 2002 die französische Firma Stocamine .
Sie hatte in der elsässischen Kaligrube Joseph Else eine Untertage - Deponie betrieben , die als modernste der Welt galt .
Dann nahm der Betreiber den falschen Abfall an : Die Gebinde entzündeten sich , Feuer breitete sich aus , hochgiftige Dämpfe füllten das Bergwerk .
Übertage wurden Schulen geschlossen - vorsorglich , erklärte die Präfektur .
70 Männer der Grubenwehr wurden bei den Löscharbeiten verletzt , von denen einige heute noch unter Lungen - und Hautkrankheiten leiden .
Obwohl es Monate dauerte , ehe der Brand gelöscht war , machte das Unglück nur regional Schlagzeilen .
Für mehr reichte der Nachrichtenwert nicht aus .
" Wenn dasselbe jetzt mit nuklearem Abfall - , auch wenn nichts passiert ist , wäre das in der ganzen Welt .
Wenn einer von der Leiter fällt in einem Kernkraftwerk , hat das schon einen Nachrichtenwert , weil da ein hohes Stigma mit verbunden ist . "
Ortwin Renn von der Universität Stuttgart .
" Diese ganze Frage der Langzeitverantwortung des Menschen für Umweltbelastungen ist sehr , sehr stark mit der radioaktiven Endlagerung verbunden . "
Anders als der Atommüll steht der chemotoxische Abfall nicht im Rampenlicht .
Noch nicht einmal die großen Umweltschutzorganisationen interessieren sich für die Chemie - Endlager .
Vielleicht , weil sie weniger
Angst verbreiten als Atommüll : Der strahlt , kann auf Distanz Schaden anrichten , niemand spürt die Gefahr .
Giftmüll dagegen scheint kontrollierbar .
Renn :
" Bei den Chemieabfällen hat man den Eindruck , wenn man die nicht gerade isst und trinkt , da kann nicht so viel passieren . "
Dabei können sich selbst in der Geologie mit ihren gewaltigen Zeitrahmen die Bedingungen ändern .
So versteckt sich in der Nähe der Untertagedeponie Herfa - Neurode im Untergrund eine besondere Senke : Dort hat vor langer Zeit Wasser von der Seite her die Salzdecke aufgelöst .
Dann änderte sich die tektonische Lage , das Wasser floss andere Wege , der Prozess stoppte .
Zwar war in der Senke das Salz verschwunden , aber das Gebirge darüber senkte sich und schützt die Salzdecke seitdem .
Wer aber garantiert , dass die geologischen Kräfte sich auf lange Sicht nicht wieder ändern und die Gifte in die Ökosysteme schleusen ?
Wir sind in einem Einlagerungsbereich angekommen .
Gerold Jahn :
" Hier sehen wir die 200 Liter Stahlblechfässer , immer vier Stück auf einer Palette stehend , mit zwei Stahlbändern oder Kunststoffbändern gebändert , damit die nicht verrutschen beim Transport und nicht herunterfallen können . "
In den Fässern stecken die Rauchgasreinigungsrückstände einer schweizerischen Müllverbrennungsanlage .
Der Gabelstapler greift sich Palette auf Palette , stapelt sie bis knapp unter die Firste .
Jahn :
" Hier ist die Höhe so , dass maximal drei Behältnisse übereinander gestellt werden können . "
Ein seltsamer Arbeitsplatz : Nur die eigenen Scheinwerfer geben zwei Lichtkegel .
Schaltet der Fahrer sie ab , herrscht vollkommene Dunkelheit - so dunkel , wie es über Tage niemals werden kann .
Als das 1993 stillgelegte Salzbergwerk Niedersachsen - Riedel bei Hannover in eine Untertagedeponie umgewandelt werden sollte , wehrten sich die Anwohner .
Außerdem hatte sich der Wettbewerb um den Giftmüll so verschärft , dass eine weitere Anlage kaum wirtschaftlich gewesen wäre .
In Herfa - Neurode wird über die Deponie nicht diskutiert .
Ortwin Renn :
" Die normalen Laien bewerten Risiken nach so genannten Heurismen , das sind eine Art Gedankenanker , die es uns erlauben , Dinge zu vergleichen und aus diesem Vergleich heraus die Schwere des Risikos einzuschätzen .
Da spielen Dinge eine Rolle wie , ob man sich an das Risiko gewöhnt hat , ob das Risiko mit Sicherheit tödlich ist oder ob es vielfach doch nur zu Blechschäden kommt , ob das Risiko gerecht oder ungerecht verteilt ist , also sogenannte qualitative Risikomerkmale , die dann auf die Höhe des wahrgenommenen Risikos einen großen Einfluss ausüben . "
Giftige Abfälle machen den Menschen weniger Angst als die strahlenden , beobachtet Risikosoziologe Ortwin Renn .
Zum
Teil mag das daran liegen , dass es oft ganz alltägliche Gegenstände sind , bei deren Produktion diese Abfälle entstehen - und man ist an sie gewöhnt , sei es nur , weil in der Schublade Batterien liegen .
Doch das allein könne die gewaltige Aufmerksamkeitsdiskrepanz noch nicht erklären .
Ein zweiter Mechanismus sei am Wirken .
" Es gibt immer eine Art Pfadfinder , die ganz bestimmte Gedankengänge in die Bevölkerung hinein setzen .
Das sind quasi Sündenböcke , für die dann alles Mögliche auch auf sie abgeladen wird .
Und Sündenböcke sind keine Unschuldslämmer , die tun auch genau das , für das sie dann auch verantwortlich gemacht werden .
Aber sie nehmen von den anderen auch ein Stück weit den Druck weg . "
Und so könnten sich andere Risiken sozusagen im Windschatten des Sündenbocks Atommüll lange Zeit verstecken .
Die Wahrnehmung ist : Chemotoxische Abfälle sind zwar gefährlich , aber wenn man sie tief genug vergräbt , sind sie weg .
Renn :
" Aus dem Blick , aus dem Sinn . "
Das Vertrauen geht weit : Werden die Untertage - Deponien eines Tages geschlossen , ist keine Nachsorge geplant .
Alles wird der Geologie überlassen - was angesichts der Ewigkeit , die diese Stoffe gefährlich sein werden , wohl die einzige Lösung ist .
There were candlelit vigils not just outside the hospital in Buenos Aires but around the world .
After spending 12 days in critical care with heart and lung problems , Diego Armando Maradona was lying among the patients in a psychiatric ward while his family argued about further treatment .
" They were all crazy in there , " he later recalled .
" One guy said he was Napoleon and they did n't believe him .
I said I was Maradona and they did n't believe me , either . "
The ultimate sequel to that episode , currently playing out in South Africa , would stretch anyone 's credulity .
In 2004 , as the world awaited the news of his death at 43 from a combination of physical problems provoked by the ravages of fame , his spectacularly turbulent existence had reached its lowest point .
But six years later , against all the odds and expectations , he is once again dominating the World Cup , the competition in which he experienced his hours of greatest glory and infamy .
Even at this quarter - final stage , his renaissance as Argentina 's head coach is the story of the year .
Should he go on to guide his team to three more victories and see his captain , Javier Mascherano , lift the trophy that he himself held aloft in 1986 , it will forever be seen as one of the most remarkable comebacks in the entire history of sport .
The latest chapter of his saga began in November 2008 , when he landed in Glasgow to start his new life with a friendly match against Scotland at Hampden Park – where , 29 years earlier , he had scored his first international goal .
" If I had n't accepted the offer I would have been a coward , " he told a press conference .
" We have a long , hard road ahead of us .
It 's not going to be easy , but the team needed someone to guide and help them , and now we 're on a mission together . "
Few imagined that the mission would achieve its aim .
At that point the sum total of Maradona 's coaching experience amounted to 23 matches in charge of Deportivo Mandiyú of Corrientes and Racing Club of Buenos Aires .
The first , in 1994 , ended in relegation and the second , the following year , in chaos .
So no one knew what to expect when he was suddenly appointed to take over from Alfio Basile midway through the World Cup qualifying campaign , except the near - certainty of further chaos .
In Glasgow he was asked if he would be indulging in the sort of antics seen from him at the 2006 World Cup in Germany when , in a rather grotesque sideshow , he became a sort of cheerleader to the team .
" It depends on how the team are playing , " he said .
" If they 're making me feel safe and sound , I 'll be fine .
If they 're making me nervous , then maybe I 'll behave like you saw in Germany . "
His team won their first three matches , but a 6 - 1 defeat at the hands of Bolivia at 3,657 metres ( 12,000 ft ) in La Paz – as heavy as any in Argentina 's history – left them lying fifth in the 10 - team Conmebol group , from which four countries would qualify automatically .
It was for the next game , a 1 - 0 victory at home to Colombia , that he courted ridicule by bringing the then 34 - year - old Juan Sebastián Verón into the starting line - up , and after three further defeats they were still stranded in fifth place , with two matches to play .
There were only 38,000 spectators in Buenos Aires 's Monumental stadium , which holds almost twice that number , when Argentina played Peru in the first of those crucial fixtures last October , but those who had kept faith were rewarded with a moment of matchless melodrama amid a rainstorm of tropical proportions .
After Martín Palermo , the veteran Boca Juniors striker , had come off the bench to score the winner in the second minute of stoppage time , Maradona celebrated victory with a belly - slide along the sodden touchline .
Four days later , after Mario Bolatti , another late substitute , had scored in the 84th minute in Montevideo to secure victory over Uruguay and the final automatic qualifying place , he directed an obscene tirade at the media .
For that outburst he received a two - month ban from all football activity and a fine of 25,000 Swiss francs ( £ 15,400 ) from Fifa .
His critics were given further ammunition when his squad for South Africa contained neither Esteban Cambiasso nor Javier Zanetti , two vastly experienced internationals who had just helped José Mourinho 's Internazionale win the Champions League .
Together with Maradona 's preference for the ageing Verón over Juan Román Riquelme , the widely adored playmaker who has never been included in his selections , this was seen as a further sign of his unfitness for the job of leading Argentina to their first World Cup victory since his own annus mirabilis of 1986 .
The method to his apparent madness has become apparent over the past three weeks .
" What Maradona did first when he took over , " an Argentinian journalist said this week , " was to nominate the key man in his side .
That was Mascherano .
He actually said , ' The team will be Mascherano and 10 others . '
And when he selected the squad of 23 to go to South Africa , he divided it very clearly into two : there would be the 11 players of the side , plus 12 supporters . "
What this means is that the players on the bench are chosen for their ability to buy into the team ethic as much as for their skills – just as Clive Woodward , before the 2003 rugby World Cup , convinced his reserves that although they were virtually certain never to appear in the tournament itself , their presence was no less vital to the success of the enterprise than that of the members of the XV .
Maradona did not want a substitutes ' bench – or the team 's hotel in Pretoria – containing players who would resent their enforced inactivity .
Hence , by deduction , the absences of Cambiasso , Zanetti and a few others .
Another significant piece of man-management has taken place at the tournament , and has involved Lionel Messi , by general consent the best player of his generation , as Maradona once was .
Their relationship was sticky at the start , the head coach seeming to believe – like the majority of his compatriots – that Messi 's heart belongs to Barcelona , where he was taken at the age of 13 , rather than to Argentina .
Since arriving in South Africa , however , Maradona has taken every opportunity to sing the praises of his latest heir to the No10 shirt , speaking not only of his talent but of his charisma and serenity .
When Mascherano was rested , for the third group match against Greece , the 23 - year - old Messi was given the captain 's armband .
After the 3 - 1 win over Mexico , Maradona repeated his frequent call for referees to provide better protection for his new favourite .
" Whenever Messi has the ball everyone is trying to kick his legs , " he said .
" What is being done to him is a scandal .
I lived through that 20 years ago .
I understand why the Mexicans did it , but there is a limit to everything . "
On the pitch at the University of Pretoria 's High Performance Centre this week a couple of hundred journalists watched Maradona leading his players through a high - spirited practice match , 11 - a - side on a half - sized pitch , with the head coach not only refereeing but delivering a constant running commentary .
He spotted the ball for Messi when a penalty was awarded , and after Carlos Tevez missed one at the other end the Manchester City striker was forced to join the coaches in the goalmouth for the daily ritual in which the squad are invited to unleash a simultaneous volley of shots at them from the edge of the area , hitting the ball as hard as they like .
Maradona himself took a particularly ferocious strike from Mascherano on the back of the head , without evident damage to the relationship between head coach and captain .
On this particular evening , however , Maradona denied himself the large Havana cigar which he sometimes lights up as he leaves the training ground .
What the reporters were not allowed to see was the real work going on , including the meticulous preparation of the set - piece routines that delivered the team 's first three goals of the tournament .
A group of assistants including Héctor Enrique , who likes to remind people that it was he who passed Maradona the ball to start the run for that second goal against England 24 years ago , are earning their money while the head coach astutely absorbs the attention and deflects the pressure .
The contrast with other coaches at this World Cup is almost hilariously vivid .
But then none of them has lived a life remotely like his .
It is as though everything in Maradona 's 49 years , the bad and the good , the sublime and the reprehensible , has been leading up to this , and he is not going to let it go now .

Everyone knows the software programmer stereotype : Developers are lone hackers working late into the night , the room illuminated only by their computer monitors .
They subsist on delivery pizza and Mountain Dew .
They rarely leave their posts when there 's coding to be done , sometimes even spending Friday night on the old couch in the office .
While that description might sound like a romantic ideal to a certain brand of misanthropic hacker , the vast majority of developers are ordinary workers .
They have families , hobbies , and responsibilities that have nothing to do with build cycles and release schedules .
Unfortunately , however , workplace pressures often force these everyday developers into situations that bear far too close a resemblance to the basement - dwelling existence of legend .

Long work hours , missed vacation and sick time , and lack of recognition and advancement are endemic in the software development industry .
For all the talk of a " knowledge economy , " some of the smartest and most highly specialized members of the workforce are often treated like disposable labor , easily replaced by newer , cheaper recruits .
The result , predictably , is burnout , where the most seasoned team members leave the organization for greener pastures -- and or vacate the field completely .
Any sensible manager should recognize that this is an untenable situation , one that will weaken any company in the long run .
And yet , software development teams seem to have a way of creeping into toxic work patterns before anyone realizes what 's happening .
If we as an industry hope to reverse this trend , software managers need to be mindful of the signs of workplace breakdown and , more important , take swift corrective action .
It 's not all fun and games
Nowhere are the worst practices of software development teams more prevalent than in the videogame industry .
In an editorial published last week , Gamasutra 's Leigh Alexander asked , " Is the game industry a happy place ? "
The answers were less than encouraging .
Alexander quoted one anonymous developer as saying , " Game development has a way of taking over your life , because there 's always more that can be done to improve perceived quality .
I 've seen a lot of divorces in my time in the game industry . "
That should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the industry over the years .
As far back as 2004 , an anonymous commenter going by the handle " ea_spouse " wrote of long hours , missed vacations , and lack of comp time or sick leave at Electronic Arts , a major game development firm .
" Put up or shut up and leave : this is the core of EA 's Human Resources policy , " ea_spouse wrote .
" The concept of ethics or compassion or even intelligence with regard to getting the most out of one 's workforce never enters the equation . "
We 're always on the hunt for new stuff to show you guys and it seems to me that there 's a lot of interest in taking your Canon HDSLR up in the air for a ride .
We showed you a Canon EOS 7D ( reviews ) a few weeks ago , a Canon Rebel T2i/550D ( reviews ) flying over Montana , and today , we 've got a few more samples .
Obviously , flying a remote controlled helicopter takes training and lots of practice – so this may be one of the harder hobbies to pick up ( or to become a professional ) , but the results can be amazing .
Here for example is a well done video of some bicyclists performing some amazing tricks – and the ability to fly up to be close to the action and to fly along the route the bikers take is pretty cool stuff !

Hand launching a custom built Canon 5D Mark II aerial drone from a boat in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico to capture oil spill imagery :
Although we are able to hand launch our drones in very confined space , we 've never done this from the back of a very unstable pitching and rolling boat … in rain and drizzle .
Over $ 10,000 in equipment can be lost in an instant !
Between boat movement and gulf winds this was an extreme challenge !
What a great show of talent !

So , there are a few great samples .
Can you do it too ?
Well , it will cost you a bit more than just buying a camera ( especially if you crash !

After all , there are rules you 'll need to learn as well as following all of the FAA rules in your area for remotely controlled aircraft .
It is dangerous , so please be careful !

Image caption People in Denmark , Germany , Spain , Sweden and the Netherlands ate the most meat
Eating less meat may be the key to keeping a healthy weight , say researchers .
A European study of almost 400,000 adults found that eating meat was linked with weight gain , even in people taking in the same number of calories .
The strongest association was found with processed meat , such as sausages and ham , the Imperial College London team reported .
It suggests that high - protein diets may not help slimmers in the long run .
The findings , published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , also support public health messages advocating cutting down on the amount of meat we eat , the researchers said .
The study looked at data from adults taking part in a large project looking at the link between diet and cancer .
Participants from 10 European countries , including the UK , were weighed and measured at the start and then asked to report their weight five years later .
They also filled in a detailed food questionnaire .
Weight gain
Overall , the researchers found that meat consumption was associated with weight gain in both men and women .
More detailed analyses showed that the link was still significant after taking into account overall calorie intake , physical activity and other factors which may have skewed the results .
The team calculated that in people who ate the same number of calories , an extra 250g of meat a day - equal to a small steak - led to an additional weight gain of 2 kg ( 5lbs ) over five years .
A portion of meat should be about the size of a deck of cards Sian Porter , Dietician
It counters the theory that diets with high amounts of protein and low amounts of carbohydrate promote weight loss .
Although it is not clear why meat would lead to weight gain in people eating the same number of calories , one theory is that energy - dense foods like meat alter how the body regulates appetite control .
But there could also be another lifestyle or dietary explanation for the link that was not accounted for by the study .
Study leader Dr Anne - Claire Vergnaud said : " I would recommend to people to control their consumption of meat to maintain a healthy weight and good health in general during life . "
But she added : " Decreasing the amount of meat alone would not be an adequate weight loss strategy . "
Sian Porter , a dietician and spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association , said there were caveats in the study , including the fact that at the end - weight was self - reported .
But she said it was an interesting finding .
" We eat more meat than we need .
" What I say to my patients is to think about variety - so have an egg for breakfast instead of bacon , cheese for lunch instead of ham and fish for the evening meal .
She advised people to eat lots of lentils and pulse , wholegrains , fruit and veg and oily fish as well as meat .
" Portion size is the other thing - a portion of meat should be about the size of a deck of cards . "
You better have a ticket if you want to pray with Her Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh .
Sunday ’s morning service at the Cathedral Church of St. James has been fully booked for weeks .
Those lucky enough to have tickets best not forget their wallets — Father Abraham will be checking I.D. at the door .
Yet when it comes right down to it organizers say the mass will be just another Sunday service .
“ This is church , just Sunday morning church , ” says Dean Douglas Stoute , who will be delivering the sermon .
Stoute says the Queen would n’t want the service to be all about her .
Like everyone else , she ’ll be there to pray .
“ This is a worship experience for the entire community of which the Queen happens to be a member , ” he says .
Still , it is a big deal to have royals in the congregation .
And St. James is prepared .
The front steps gleam with a fresh coat of paint , the church has had a full cleaning and all clutter will be removed by the big day .
A few days before the Royal visit , organizers plan to gather in the church for a run-through .
Stoute wears a tan suit , clerical collar and frameless spectacles .
He holds a piece of paper rolled into a thin tube , which he waves around as he runs through the Sunday plan , minute by minute .
The front pew where the Queen is to be seated is now blocked off with yellow caution tape .
Stoute explains it was just sanded and re-stained to erase the word “ sex ” — scratched into the wood by an unknown prankster .
When the service is over the Queen will turn left at the end of the aisle to enter St. George ’s Chapel .
She will rededicate the halfway refurbished chapel , which was damaged by a fire in 2008 .
Once the Queen is safely inside , the congregation will file out of the church .
“ So that she does n’t get caught up in the traffic and the traffic does n’t get caught up in her , ” Stoute explains .
Environment Canada has forecast a stifling high of 31 degrees for Sunday .
Stoute says there will be water on hand should older members feel faint .
“ But not water for everybody , ” he adds .
“ It ’s not a football game . ”
“ We need to get a pen , ” one member of the planning party reminds him when they discuss the signing of the royal bibles .
“ The Duke of Edinburgh always comes with his own pen , ” Stoute declares .
And if he forgets it ?
“ He does n’t . ”
The dean pauses .
“ But we will have a pen . ”

The previous government had removed this proposed clause during the Bill ’s Parliamentary readings , but then replaced it with a different amendment which will indeed allow the Secretary of State for Business to block any site which “ the court is satisfied has been , is being or is likely to be used for or in connection with an activity that infringes copyright " .
The purpose of computing in insight , not numbers
R.W. Hamming
BANGKOK , Thailand —
It first appeared to the paleontologist as a dull glint , half - submerged in a coal pit , but winking back sunlight nonetheless .
“ Its enamel was a bit reflective in the dirt , ” said Sasidhorn Khansubha , a government - employed Thai paleontologist .
She and the country ’s foremost primate fossil expert were picking through a coal mine on a dig in Krabi , along the southern Thai coast .
“ I had no idea if it was even important , so I handed it to the specialist , ” Sasidhorn said .
“ She was shocked and thrilled .
It ’s what we ’d sought for so long . ”
They ’d discovered a jawbone , half - crushed and stained through with coal grime .
After analysis , it revealed the existence of the “ Siam Ape , ” a 15 - pound simian that roamed Asia ’s ancient jungles 35 million years ago .
If leading paleontologists are correct , this Asian primate could be an ancestor to us all .
This fossilized jawbone of an extinct " Siam Ape " suggests that humankind 's evolutionary precursors evolved in Asia , not Africa .
( Patrick Winn / GlobalPost )
“ For a long time , people have said early anthropoids [ higher - order primates ] developed in Africa , ” said Yaowalak Chaimanee , a senior fossil specialist with Thailand ’s Department of Mineral Resources .
“ We propose the real origin is Asia . ”
Paleontologists almost universally agree that humans evolved in Africa through a split from apes about 5 million years ago .
Dialing back our ancestry a step further , however , is more tricky .
For more than a century , researchers have believed that Africa gave rise not only to humans but also to our precursors : advanced primates .
A newer wave of fossil finds in Asia , however , suggests this happened somewhere in Southeast Asia .
At some point , Yaowalak said , these higher - functioning primates migrated to Africa and then further evolved into hominids : the socially complex , upright - walking biological order that includes gorillas , chimps , orangutans and human beings .
This Asia origins theory — still debated by some leading paleontologists — took off with the 1995 discovery of the fossilized “ Dawn Monkey ” in central China .
The palm - sized monkey lived 45 - million years ago , roughly 12 million years before the oldest anthropoid found in Africa .
Though quite primitive , the Dawn Monkey is now considered one of the oldest primate “ missing links ” with more - advanced features , said Christopher Beard , the Carnegie Museum of Natural History paleontologist who oversaw the fossil ’s discovery .
( It was technically found by a pickaxe - wielding Chinese farmer that Beard employed . )
These transitional creatures are a cross between the most ancient monkeys — slow - moving , nocturnal tree - dwellers — and the larger , upright beasts like chimps .
Over time , their brains grew bigger and their eyes became more forward - facing , Beard said .
Thailand ’s “ Siam Ape , ” and specimens found in neighboring Myanmar , are larger and more advanced than the minuscule Dawn Monkey , Beard said .
These fruit - and - seed eaters were closer to a gibbon ’s size and weight , perhaps about 1.5 feet tall and weighing about 15 pounds .
“ Siamopithecus [ the Siam Ape ] is one of several Asian fossils that helps locate the likely birthplace of anthropoids as being somewhere in Asia , maybe Thailand , maybe somewhere nearby , ” Beard said .
“ The fossil record , ” he said , “ really is n’t sufficient to make a more precise statement than southern Asia or southeastern Asia as the likely epicenter . ”
The Asia origins theory , Beard said , is now endorsed by about 80 percent of paleontologists familiar with the debate .
Others claim that scientists have discovered too few good - sized , intact bone fragments to support the assertion .
But the search for more “ missing links ” in Southeast Asia is waylaid by language barriers and scant government funding for the region ’s government researchers .
Yaowalak is Thailand ’s only paleontologist searching for more evidence of these transitional primates .
Her facilities are basic .
The lab in her Bangkok office building was converted to administrative quarters and she now examines fossils on a cluttered tabletop .
Lacking sophisticated scanning equipment , she recently brought a newly discovered fossil to a nearby hospital and offered to pay for an MRI scan .
The staff turned her away .
“ I guess they thought I was wasting their time , ” she said .
Yaowalak ’s superiors only expect her to publish findings in Thai .
Getting published in English - language journals — the medium for exposing advancements to the world — requires writing up findings to the best of her abilities and then forwarding them to sympathetic foreign colleagues , who fix her language errors for free .
This tedious process helps explain why the Siam Ape , discovered in 1996 , was only published last year in the “ Anatomical Record , ” a journal certifying evolutionary discoveries .
“ A full scientific translation can cost $ 100 per page , ” Yaowalak said .
“ I just do n’t have money for that . ”
More remains of our simian ancestors are out there , she said , but they remain difficult to reach .
Many are beneath the Gulf of Thailand , the result of sea level fluctuations and tectonic shifts , she said .
In the Siam Ape ’s era , Southeast Asia was a long crescent - shaped curl of land seamlessly connecting what is now Indonesia and the Philippines .
As these land masses drifted apart , these primate habitats sank beneath the sea , she said .
Even the Siam Ape ’s bones would have eluded discovery had Yaowalak not realized coal miners fortuitously exposed fossil - rich layers deep beneath the soil .
The mine is now closed off and filled with water .
The next - closest region flush with anthropoid fossils lies inside Myanmar , in the remote Bagan region forbidden to most foreigners by the country ’s military junta .
Beard , traveling with special permission , has discovered 38 - million - year old bones there from a creature not unlike the Siam Ape .
Yaowalak , along with a host of European researchers , has also ventured to this Myanmar province several times in hopes of finding similar fossils .
Along the way , when jeeps can’t ply the primitive dirt roads , they travel on elephantback .
“ There are lots of deposits out there , ” Yaowalak said .
“ We just have to keep looking .
You have to walk with a wish , a wish to find something important , and a lot of luck . ”
The Obama administration could file yet another lawsuit against Arizona if it decides racial profiling is taking place under that state ’s new immigration law , Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said .
Mr. Holder ’s Justice Department sued Tuesday to block the law , arguing that it infringed on the federal government ’s right to determine immigration policy .
But the lawsuit made almost no mention of racial profiling - a key issue in President Obama ’s attacks against the law in the weeks before the lawsuit was filed .
The attorney general , speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival last week in an interview aired on CBS on Sunday , said the pre-emption argument was the “ strongest initial argument ” against the law .
If the law goes into effect despite the lawsuit , he said , federal officials will watch for profiling .
“ If that was the case , we would have the tools and we would bring suit on that basis , ” he said .
Mr. Holder came under fire in May after he acknowledged to a Senate committee that he had not read the Arizona law , despite having publicly criticized it and arguing that it would lead to racial profiling .
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer , at a meeting of the nation ’s governors in Boston , told the Associated Press that the administration can’t seem to make up its mind about its criticism of the law .
“ Why would they have to hesitate , after all the comments they made , and all the outrage that they made against the bill in regards to racial profiling , that it did n’t show up ? ” she said .
Speaking on C - SPAN ’s “ Newsmakers ” program , Rep. Darrell Issa of California , the ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said Mr. Obama ’s lawsuit was breaking new ground in “ a misuse ” of the supremacy clause of the Constitution .
“ Never before have we challenged something because it might lead to something .
There ’s nowhere in the Constitution that says a state is limited to what it absolutely wo n’t do and can be stopped for what it might do , ” he said .
He said Arizona ’s law amounts to “ self - help consistent with existing federal programs that have been passed by Republican and Democratic presidents , ” and therefore does not conflict with the Constitution .
Immigration has been a flash - point issue for years , and Arizona ’s law has only fanned the flames .
The law , which is slated to take effect July 29 unless a judge blocks it , would require police to check the legal status of anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally whom they encounter while enforcing other laws .
It says race may not be used as a factor for determining who should be questioned , but opponents , including Mr. Obama , say they fear it will lead to racial profiling nonetheless .
A half - dozen lawsuits already have been filed against the law and the administration could have joined one of them in a friend - of - the - court brief .
Instead , the Justice Department filed its own lawsuit , showing a strong statement of Mr. Obama ’s interest in Arizona ’s law .
Arizona officials argue that their law does n’t do more than enforce what is already on the books under U.S. law , but Mr. Holder said the new rules do n’t account for the nuances of federal policy , such as international relations and national security concerns .
“ States and local governments can certainly help the federal government enforce immigration laws .
What we ’re saying is that they cannot pass laws that are inconsistent with the federal laws or do things that contravene federal policy when it comes to the enforcement of our immigration laws , ” he said .
Still , Mrs. Brewer said last week that the federal government is being hypocritical in singling out Arizona for enacting a policy when there are dozens of so - called “ sanctuary cities ” that refuse to report illegal immigrants - which also potentially conflicts with federal law .
The Obama administration contends that the border is more secure now than at any other time in recent memory , and points as evidence to the decline in illegal immigrants caught crossing the border and the increase in U.S. Border Patrol agents begun under Mr. Obama ’s predecessor , George W. Bush .
Now Mr. Obama is pushing Congress to act on a broad immigration bill that would legalize illegal immigrants and rewrite the legal immigration system , though it does not include a temporary - worker program that businesses and many Republicans say is needed to gain their support .
Sen . Jon Kyl , Arizona Republican , said that has been jettisoned at the wishes of labor unions .
“ A temporary - worker program would have to be a part of any comprehensive immigration reform .
And there is n’t support for that in the Congress right now , ” said Mr. Kyl , who was a key part of the 2007 effort to pass a bill .

AT&T recently announced that it was changing up its data plans for all smartphones — including the iPhone .
Instead of a $ 30 unlimited 3G plan , there 's now a 2GB monthly cap for $ 25 per month , as well as a $ 15 tier that gets you 200 MB of data .
Though this upset some heavy data users , we here at Ars argued that most people should be able to save at least a little bit of cash each month , as 2GB can be a difficult to hit for many of us .
A number of our readers pointed out , however , that there are several factors that can contribute to higher data usage — factors that would be amplified by the release of iOS 4.0 and the new iPhone 4 along with it .
With the new OS , there are some new options to take into consideration when the OS lands on June 21 , so if you 're right on the edge of your data plan on the iPhone , here are five reasons why your data usage might go up :
More streaming music thanks to multitasking
Reading the comments on our previous two stories about AT&T , it seemed like there were two camps : people who streamed music all day and people who did n't .
Thanks to the multitasking capabilities added to iOS 4 , we 'll all be able to stream audio more easily by keeping Pandora , Last.fm , NPR , or our other favorite streaming apps alive in the background while we do other tasks .
Depending on how long you stream the music , you may end up coming closer your 2GB monthly limit faster than you did before .
Netflix streams on the iPhone
Netflix recently announced that it plans to introduce an iPhone app this summer , and CEO Reed Hastings demoed it during the 2010 WWDC keynote .
The app will stream Watch Instantly videos over both WiFi and 3G and , since it's one of the most popular online video services , it seems like a given that Netflix subscribers will probably start using more data because of it .
Hastings said that the app makes use of HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming , so the videos wo n't suck as much bandwidth while you 're streaming over 3G .
Still , with a few thousand more TV shows and movies available to you on your phone , you may bump up against that 2GB limit a little quicker than expected .
HD video uploads from the iPhone 4
The iPhone 3GS can already take videos and upload them to YouTube and MobileMe , but the new iPhone 4 can take those videos at a pixel - dense 720 p .
Not only that , but users can craft iMovie creations through Apple 's new app , giving people an even bigger motivation to put their kid , vacation , police beating , and skateboarding dog videos online straight from the phone .
Bigger and more elaborate files translates to more bandwidth usage .
Bigger image uploads
Similar to the HD video uploads , iPhone 4 will have a higher resolution camera for taking still images .
( In fact , it will have two cameras ! )
Those larger image files will require more bits sent to places like Twitter , Flickr , your mom , or all of the above .
And , with such an improved camera sensor , we have no doubt that users will start sending more pictures than ever after the new iPhone lands .
iAds
Sure , there are plenty of iPhone apps that already have ads , but how many of them are meticulously crafted using all the latest HTML5 techniques like the ones Apple demoed at WWDC ?
With the capability to do 360 degree views , games , quizzes , and videos , the potential is there for Apple 's new iAd system to use noticeably more data than the current selection of mobile ads .
And , since the companies involved have such big ad budgets , you can bet that many iPhone developers will be quick to start adopting iAds in their own apps .
What else ?
These were the top five things the Ars staff could come up with , but you undoubtedly have plenty of other reasons why your data usage might go up after the iOS 4 / iPhone 4 launch .
What do you plan to do with the new software that might start sucking up even more bandwidth ?
Are there any ways you think the new hardware or software might actually cut down on your data usage ?

Ah beloved 3rd tier Star Wars characters .

But really George Lucas , c'mon ... could you not think of a better name for the poor guy ?
New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
A towing vessel struck an oil well in the Barataria Waterway off the southeastern Louisiana coast on Tuesday , causing the well to emit oil and natural gas into Barataria Bay , the Coast Guard said in a news release .
Retired Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , said there was a sheen around the platform , and vapor that 's probably a combination of gas and water was emanating from the well , called C - 117 .
Kyle Plotkin , a spokesman for Gov. Bobby Jindal , described the well as " orphaned . "
He said it had been owned by Cedyco Corp. of Houston but was declared abandoned by the state in November 2008 .
Plotkin said the state does not own the well and added that the designation does not absolve Cedyco of responsibility for the well .
The tug vessel Pere Ana C was pushing the dredge barge Captain Buford Berry when it hit the wellhead , the Coast Guard said .
Jindal and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft , the federal on - scene coordinator for the Gulf spill , and other officials surveyed the damage by helicopter , according to a statement from the governor 's office .
" The Coast Guard 's overflight this morning confirmed the pipeline / well - head is discharging a mist of orange and brown oil about 100 feet in air , " Jindal said .
" This is the same thing we viewed on our flight to the well today .
The Coast Guard does not have a specific flow rate for the well determined yet , although there have been early reports that there is natural gas and mud mixed in with oil coming from the well . "
Jefferson Parish Councilman Chris Roberts said that while oil was gushing from the well in 6 feet of water , it was too dangerous to get close enough to estimate how much oil was leaking out .
However , Roberts said he does n't " expect it is going to be a huge problem to contain it or cap " the leak , because " it is n't uncommon . "
" Until we know the condition of it , the quickness of plugging the well is uncertain , " said Capt .
Ed Cubanski , chief of incident management for the Coast Guard 's Eighth District in New Orleans .
The Coast Guard has tapped the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , which the federal government makes available for natural resource damage assessments .
Environmental Safety and Health personnel were on the scene to clean up , as well as the Coast Guard Gulf Strike Team from Mobile , Alabama .
Allen said response crews were able to take advantage of the " significant resources " -- vessels of opportunity , skimming equipment and boom -- already in the area to work on the Gulf oil spill .
He said C - 117 was surrounded by boom .
" The Coast Guard is also beginning oil spill response actions at the site -- deploying hard and sorbent boom both north and south of the oil release , " Jindal said .
" Air assets have also been deployed to ensure response personnel are not working in a flammable atmosphere .
Once the leak source is secured , the Coast Guard will ramp up their skimming operations to collect free - floating oil .
" We know this well is close to important marshes in the Barataria Bay area , so it is important that this well is cut off quickly and the oil is contained and removed , " he said .
A safety zone has been established 2 miles around the site to protect vessels and mariners from the hazards associated with the release , the Coast Guard said .
The Coast Guard is investigating the incident , which happened about 1 a.m. Tuesday .

Recently released FCC documents reveal that Sprint is set to launch what appears to be a new case for the iPod touch that would enable 3G networking on the WiFi - only device .
Manufactured by ZTE and called the " Peel , " the case is essentially a MiFi - like mobile hotspot that snaps on to an iPod touch , giving it a network connection wherever you can get a Sprint 3G signal .
The Peel has its own 3.4 Whr lithium ion battery , which is good for about 40 hrs of standby time — there 's no mention of how long it would last in active use , but our guess is perhaps a few hours .
In addition to giving 3G network access to an iPod touch , it can also connect other WiFi devices .
It does n't appear to have a limit to the number of simultaneously connected devices ( the manual submitted to the FCC suggests this number is configurable ) , unlike most mobile hotspots that usually limit connections to four or five .
Phone Scoop also notes that the device is only cleared to operate on the slower EV - DO Rev 0 standard , and not the faster Rev A that most current 3G devices use .
We 're not exactly sure what to think of the Peel ( Apple , Peel , get it ? ) .
It seems that if an iPhone really appealed to you , you would n't have opted for the iPod touch to begin with .
Then again , there are some users who would rather have an iPhone with data but no voice , and on a different network .
Depending on the pricing and data options — especially if there is a pay - as - you - go option — it might be a nice complement to an iPod touch .
The added utility of being able to connect multiple devices — one clear advantage over an iPhone — is offset somewhat by the slower 3G speeds .
Sprint tried to attract Apple device users with a similar tack when the WiFi- only iPad was released , offering users a free iPad case with a pocket that would fit the carrier 's 4G / 3G Overdrive mobile hotspot .
Still , we 're wondering if there are any iPod touch owners out there excited by this news .
If you are , let us know in the comments .
Less than a day after Apple announced iPad sales topped 2 million in 2 months , Taiwanese company AsusTek unveiled its own tablet , the Eee Pad .
The Eee Pad goes on sale in the first quarter of the 2011 .
It will run on Windows 7 OS and will be priced between $ 399 and $ 449 , the Wall Street Journal reports .
It runs on an Intel Core 2 Duo chip , and it supports Adobe Flash .
It will be available in 10 and 12 inch models .
Asus announced plans for an App Store for its tablet computers , too .
We doubt developers will flock to build apps for this thing .
Asus introduced the Eee Pad just before the start of Computex , a major computing conference kicking off in Taipai .
Other computer makers are also presenting tablet computers , none of which look too promising .
We have n't seen or played with any of these iPad rivals , but we are skeptical that Windows on a tablet will deliver .
HP bought Palm to power its tablets after testing Windows on its Slate , so there must be a few bugs .
Regardless of performance , we think the Eee Pad is horribly named .
iPad is still a terrible name .
Throwing out a derivative name , Eee Pad -- which we do n't know how pronounce from just reading it -- is a bad idea .
If you tell your friends you are buying an Eee Pad instead of an iPad , they will laugh at you .
And if you are a parent and you buy your son or daughter an Eee Pad , your kid will be sad .
VENICE , Louisiana ( Reuters ) - BP began capturing some oil spewing from its ruptured Gulf of Mexico well on Friday as President Barack Obama warned the company against skimping on compensation to residents and businesses hurt by the 46 - day - old spill .
With tar balls washing ashore in Florida and political pressure mounting on BP Plc to free up cash for damages , company executives told investors they were putting off a decision on whether to suspend the next quarterly dividend .
“ Future decisions on the quarterly dividend will be made by the Board , as they always have been , on the basis of the circumstances at the time , ” the British energy giant said in a statement .
Its annual dividend totals $ 10.5 billion .
BP CEO Tony Hayward said the company had plenty of money to meet its obligations , including $ 5 billion in cash and additional credit lines it could tap .
It has already spent well over $ 1 billion on its oil spill response .
Obama , facing a monumental test of his presidency amid criticism he has failed to demonstrate leadership or emotion in the crisis , showed a flash of anger as he seized on the dividend issue in a meeting with state and local officials in Kenner , Louisiana .
“ They say they want to make it right .
That ’s part of their advertising campaign .
Well , we want them to make it right , ” Obama said , criticizing BP for spending lavishly on television ads to burnish its corporate image while the company considers the dividend payout .
“ What I do n’t want to hear is , when they ’re spending that kind of money on their shareholders and spending that kind of money on TV advertising , that they ’re nickel and diming fishermen or small businesses here in the Gulf , ” he said .
LIMITED PROGRESS
It was Obama ’s third trip to the region since the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
In an interview on Thursday , he said he was “ furious ” at the disaster , which threatens fishing and tourism , two of the cornerstones of the local economy .
BP made progress late on Thursday when it was able to attach a containment cap atop the ruptured well , which came after several failed attempts to choke off or curtail the oil flow .
It will take a few days for the operation to reach optimum performance , at which point the company hoped to be able to siphon off 90 percent of the leaking oil .
The U.S. Coast Guard said the containment cap placed atop the gusher a mile beneath the Gulf ’s surface was collecting about 1,000 barrels a day .
That amounts to just over 5 percent of the 19,000 barrels per day the U.S. government has estimated could be gushing from the well .
BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told U.S. television networks that the containment cap “ should work ” by capturing upward of 90 percent of the gushing crude .
U.S. officials cautioned against being too optimistic , though Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters the volume of captured oil should increase as BP closes vents on the containment apparatus to trap more of the discharge .
BP does not expect to be able to fully halt the oil flow until August , when two relief wells are to be completed .
In the meantime , Hayward vowed BP will “ stand by our obligations . ”
“ We will halt this spill and put right the damage that has been done , ” he said .
BP ’s share price , which has fallen sharply since the beginning of the crisis , gyrated in London and New York .
Standard & Poor ’s cut BP ’s credit rating to AA - minus from AA , following the example of two other rating agencies on Thursday .

The cost of credit default swaps insuring the debt of companies affected in the oil spill also fell on Friday .
BP ’s debt protection costs fell 27 basis points to 218 basis points , or $ 218,000 per year for five years to insure $ 10 million in debt , according to Markit Intraday .
But analyst Alan Sinclair of Seymour Pierce said , “ My take on the underlying message is that the dividend is safe ... ”
FLORIDA BRACES
Networks continued to televise images of oil lapping into fragile marshlands and coating sea birds , mostly along the hard - hit Louisiana coast .
Slideshow ( 31 images )
Oil sheen and tar balls washed up along a stretch shoreline crowded with beachgoers in northwest Florida in what appeared to be the spill ’s first impact on that state .
“ You see shells and jellyfish and trash , but I ’ve never seen oil here .
It ’s crazy , ” said Anthony Cross , while walking along Pensacola Beach with his three daughters , holding a child ’s fishing net full of tar .
Florida , the so - called Sunshine State with a $ 60 billion - a- year tourism industry , has been bracing this week for the forecasted arrival of the spilled oil , which has already hit Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama shores to the west .
The BP CEO had to apologize after angering Gulf residents by saying last weekend that “ I ’d like my life back . ”
The region ’s frustration with the company and the government was apparent on Friday at a free hamburger and hot dog lunch for out - of - work fisherman at the city hall in Lafitte , Louisiana .
“ It ’s all up in the air right now , ” said Jerry Perrin , who has harvested crabs and shrimp for 60 years in Louisiana ’s waters .
“ The government needs to start spending more money now . ”
Obama is confronting one of his biggest political tests as his party girds for tough congressional elections in November .
He called off a trip to Australia and Indonesia set for this month to focus on the spill , amid criticism over his handling of the crisis .
Neither Obama nor BP fared well in a new CBS public opinion poll , which found an overwhelming majority of Americans believing that both the president and the firm should be doing more to clean up the spill .
But the disapproval ratings for both Obama and BP ’s spill response -- 44 percent disapproved of the U.S. leader ’s handling of it versus 68 percent for BP -- were little changed from a similar poll last week .

Boxing vs. MMA : The Never - Ending Story

Strikeforce vs. Showtime , M - 1 Global
I ’ve had enough of this silly looking back business , as we all know that making baseless claims about the importance of future events is where the interest is at .
With that in mind , the time has come to take a look at the stories that will shape the second half of 2010 .
Unfortunately , the upcoming fight between Mark Hunt and Sean McCorkle at UFC 119 just missed the cut .
However , I venture to guess that will be a sight none of us will soon forget .
Brock Lesnar ’s epic comeback win over Shane Carwin certainly galvanized his claim to heavyweight supremacy , but that distinction is not as universally accepted as it was for Fedor Emelianenko -- and with good reason .
Carwin ’s long - term future looks like a parallel of boxer Earnie Shavers ’ career -- a horrifying puncher who came tantalizingly close to the heavyweight title only to lose in heartbreaking fashion every time .
Tapping out a super puncher is a nice feather in one ’s cap , but it will not have many buying into the notion that Lesnar has emerged as the next heavyweight doom bringer .
Lesnar ’s upcoming match with the undefeated Cain Velasquez at UFC 121 will serve as his chance to prove that years ’ worth of self - serious bravado and overwhelming hype was truly prescient .
Hype has accompanied Velasquez ever since he first stepped into the American Kickboxing Academy gym and was proclaimed a heavyweight champion in the making .
A darling of the hardcore fans despite his leaden personality , Velasquez seems just as strong a candidate as Lesnar to become the next emperor , and so far , the opinion makers seem to be lining up on his side .
Regardless of the insane amounts of prognostication that will go into attempting to predict the winner of this fight , we are getting a step closer to truly realizing a whole new heavyweight scene .
At UFC 117 Junior dos Santos will fight Roy Nelson for a title shot , which sets the table for another unbelievably significant heavyweight fight .
After years of putting on garbage heavyweight bouts , the UFC is finally setting the table in the division it turned into a headlining attraction .
How that story develops will almost certainly give us the next heavyweight kingpin , if not the next emperor .
Ever since Art Jimmerson showed up in the Octagon rocking a single boxing glove against Royce Gracie at UFC 1 , the boxing versus MMA narrative has played like Jason Voorhees -- it just keeps coming back .
The latest reincarnation of this pointless debate lies in wait right , as former UFC light heavyweight and heavyweight champion Randy Couture will take on the perpetually acerbic James Toney at UFC 118 .
All due accolades to Toney , a multi-division boxing champion and pound - for - pound luminary , but it has been a long time since anyone took the soon - to - be 42 - year - old seriously as a boxer .
In all fairness , no one banks on the 47 - year - old Couture as a legitimate contender .
Of course , he has the benefit of the fight taking place on his home turf , and , unlike Toney , he is not a blown - up middleweight boxer with a long history of shuttling back - and - forth between training camps and buffet lines .
In other words , this fight serves as a pointless exercise that will prove nothing that even a lay fan does not already know -- one needs to train MMA to be any good at MMA.
UFC President Dana
White maintains he brought Toney onboard as a way to punish “ Lights Out ” for his derogatory comments about the sport .
The amount of media and fan attention being generated by this fight suggests otherwise , and , regardless of the outcome , it will be big news .
If it generates enough money to match the hype , one has to wonder if this sort of stunt matchmaking will continue under the UFC banner .
There will always be Kimbo Slices and James Toneys around to spew hyperbole .
The question revolves around whether the UFC can balance the athletic legitimacy and promotional spectacle of its product while chasing the occasional cheap buck .
Up until February , Bobby Lashley was moonlighting as a mixed martial artist and collecting a check for his work as a professional wrestler .
Dave Batista , meanwhile , was on the World Wrestling Entertainment payroll as recently as May , and his desire to become a mixed martial artist has produced more one - off sound - bites than grueling training sessions .
Yet these are the two men Strikeforce could feature in its still theoretical pay - per - view debut .
If your stomach did not turn after reading that sentence , then you are part of the target audience for this sort of tripe .
Putting on pay - per - view events remains a high - stakes game and one with which Strikeforce is unfamiliar , so it does make sense that it would want to draw as many buyers as possible .
It ’s a strategy Zuffa used to great effect after acquiring the UFC by using name attractions like Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie to launch the careers of its next - generation superstars .
The second half of the equation was key for the UFC , as it made bankable commodities out of everyone from Tito Ortiz to Matt Hughes .
Any potential benefits of pitting Lashley against Batista exist solely in the short - term , as neither man will ever be a threat to the heavyweight elite .
After all , we are talking about a 41 - year - old Batista with no real combat sport experience and a 34 - year - old Lashley , who used to wrestle at 177 pounds before ballooning up to a chiseled 273 in the WWE .
Whether or not Strikeforce follows through on this inane idea will be one of those stories future analysts look back on when they try to map the key points in the organization ’s history .
Just about every complaint levied against Strikeforce comes down to the ongoing handicap match between the promotion and Showtime and M - 1 Global .
The second - half of 2010 seems as likely a time as any for the conflict to boil over into the public sphere .
Though the issues between the three groups are common knowledge , they have remained largely behind closed doors thanks to Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker ’s rare brand of diplomacy .
However , with Fedor Emelianenko just one fight away from free agency and his handlers at M - 1 being their usual enigmatic selves , we are guaranteed at least one storyline that will make the Brett Favre saga feel like a welcome change of pace .
Then there is Showtime , a premium cable channel that some believe is attempting to enter the MMA market by micromanaging Strikeforce .
Unfortunately for Strikeforce , there is little it can do since the promotion desperately needs the exposure Showtime can afford it .
Suddenly , the UFC ’s decision to walk away from negotiations with HBO seems downright inspired .
Somewhere underneath all the rancor and nonsense exists a fine promotion just dying to get out .
Perhaps the most frustrating part of it all is that Strikeforce does not deserve anywhere near the amount of blame it gets for this fiasco .
None of that changes the fact that Strikeforce made multiple deals with the devil , and the price will only get steeper as the year trudges along .
To put it simply , would any of you bank on Emelianenko fighting again this year ?
Let us not forget that we are talking about the same promotion that needed nearly three years to get its heavyweight champion to defend his belt .
The Federal Reserve Fraud
and the
" Invisible Government "
" No State shall make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts . "
Article 1 , Section 10 , united States ' Constitution
In 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was fraudulently pushed through Congress , Congressman Charles Lindbergh stated : " This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth .... When the President signs this Act , the invisible government by the money power , proven to exist by the Money Trust Investigation , will be legalized ....
The new law will create inflation whenever the trust wants inflation ....
From now on , depression will be scientifically created . "
IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK REALLY " FEDERAL " ?
Most people assume that the Federal Reserve Bank is federal -- that is , part of the united States ' government .
However , the Ninth Circuit Court put that issue to rest in 1982 when they adjudicated :
" Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks , and applying the relevant factors , we conclude that the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA , but are independent , privately - owned and locally controlled corporations . "
[ Lewis vs. U.S. , 680 F. 2d 1239 , 1241 ]
" We have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known .
I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks .
Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are U.S. government institutions .
They are not government institutions .
They are private credit monopolies ; domestic swindlers , rich and predatory money lenders which prey upon the people of the united States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers .
The Federal Reserve Banks are the agents of the foreign central banks .
The truth is the Federal Reserve Board has usurped the Government of the United States by the arrogant credit monopoly which operates the Federal Reserve Board . "
[ Congressman Louis T. McFadden , Chairman of the House Banking & Currency Committee , speech on the floor of the House of Representatives , June 10 , 1932 ]
" In the united States we have , in effect , two governments .... We have the duly constituted Government .... Then we have an independent , uncontrolled and uncoordinated government in the Federal Reserve System , operating the money powers which are reserved to Congress by the Constitution . "
[ Congressman Wright Patman , Chairman of the House Banking & Currency Committee , speech on the House floor , 1967 ]
" Most Americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international money lenders ....
The accounts of the Federal Reserve System have never been audited .
It operates outside the control of Congress and .... manipulates the credit of the united States . " [ Senator Barry Goldwater ]
" Federal Reserve Notes are illegal " [ US Representative Dr. Ron Paul ]
IF THIS IS TRUE WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD ABOUT THIS ?
Basically , it is because the international bankers , having unlimited funds , own and control the mainstream media .
" These international bankers and Rockefeller - Standard Oil interests control the majority of newspapers and the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of public office officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government . "
[ Teddy Roosevelt ]
We also have to ask ourselves why we were not taught the truth about the Federal Reserve in school .
Click on the following video link to hear the testimony of Norman Dodd , head of the congressional committee that investigated the Rockefeller , Carnegie and Ford foundations and their intent to control education : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZqZGEBkX1s
HOW DOES THIS AFFECT ME ?
Congress initially defined a lawful money " dollar " as being and consisting of ( at least ) 371.25 grains of pure silver .
Before 1965 anyone could exchange one paper dollar for one real silver dollar .
However , in 1965 the united States ' mint stopped minting silver dollars .
When this occurred inflation began to skyrocket .
Now it takes a whole fist full of paper dollars ( i.e. , " Federal Reserve Notes " ) to buy one real silver dollar .
It now takes two working parents to support a family and the national debt is accelerating higher and higher .
And , of course , the debt of individuals , corporations , cities , counties or states is much , much higher .
The paper and digital currency that bankers create out of thin air is backed by nothing .
The more paper " dollars " they roll off the printing presses or digital " dollars " created by computers , the less each one is worth .
Therefore , it takes more of 'em to buy the things we need , so the price of everything has to go up and up and up in endless inflation .
Unfortunately , wages for most people will not increase fast enough to stay ahead of the game .
But not to worry , the international banksters have created plastic " credit cards " to help you out ( heh , heh , heh ) .
Of course , they do n't bother to tell us that they do not create enough paper / digital currency to pay off the debt plus interest so mathematically the economy will eventually collapse as has always occurred in history with paper currencies .
HOW DID ALL OF THIS GET STARTED ?
Briefly , the Federal Reserve system was created by international banking families such as the Rothschilds , Warburgs and Rockefellers .
This international banking cartel creates " money " out of thin air .
It only costs them a few cents to print each Federal Reserve Note " dollar bill " , and then they " bill " the American people for the full face value of the note .
Then to add insult to injury , they charge us interest to borrow their so - called " money " .
If you or I did this , we would be arrested for counterfeiting and fraud .
This system was instituted gradually , starting with the Civil War and culminating with the fraudulent passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 .
The passage of the Federal Reserve Act was unconstitutional because 1 ) the US Constitution prohibited " bills of credit " ( i.e. , paper notes ) and 2 ) the US Constitution would have to be amended to go off the silver and gold coin standard for money .
The US Constitution , the supreme Law of the Land , can only be amended pursuant to Article V. The US Constitution cannot be amended by statute .
These unlawful actions by a criminal Congress remind me of a quote by the honorable Alfred E. Neuman of Mad Magazine fame : " America is that land which fought for freedom and then passed laws to get rid of it . "
The Federal Reserve is also a monopoly -- in a country where monopolies are supposed to be illegal .
The IRS deposits people 's income tax checks directly in the Federal Reserve banks -- not in the united States Treasury .
Therefore , the IRS , an unconstitutional entity , is merely the collection agency for the international banksters .
Over the years the IRS has become a tool of the elite banking families to financially attack and / or imprison people who expose the Federal Reserve .
It is also a tool used by the D.C. elite to attack people who expose government corruption .
If you take out a paper dollar and look at it , you will notice that it states at the top of the " bill " : " FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE " .
A " note " is , by definition , an " instrument of debt " and " evidence of debt " .
According to BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY ( Sixth Ed. ) " MONEY " is defined : " In usual and ordinary acceptation it means coins and paper currency used as circulating medium of exchange , and does not embrace notes , bonds , evidences of debt , or other personal or real estate . "
Now this may come as a shock to some people , but those paper " Federal Reserve Notes " are not money and they are not dollars .
Federal Reserve Notes are merely IOUs .
There is nothing backing these " bills " except debt .
However , people ( voluntarily ) use them as [ instead of ] money and as dollars .
The key word is " as " .
( The smallest words can have the biggest meanings . )
Banks can create this phony " currency " out of thin air .
Banks can loan out " currency " that they do n't even have .
When you apply for a loan from a bank , the bank does not have anything to back up that loan because they are allowed to loan out about seven to ten times more " currency " than they have on deposit .
This is not mere speculation ; this is a matter of court record , testimony under Oath , by a former lawyer for the Federal Reserve .
In other words bankers create " currency " with just the stroke of a pen or the keystroke of a computer .
These bankers then charge you " interest " to borrow this " currency " , which is nothing more than some numbers typed on a piece of paper !
If We the People ever did this we would be spending many years in a federal prison .
Unfortunately , they do not print enough currency to pay the interest so more pseudo - dollars must be borrowed to pay off the interest , resulting in a unpayable , ever - increasing debt .
This fraudulent " currency " system benefits not only bankers , but lawyers as well .
As has been demonstrated by numerous citizens , government lawyers ( members of the Bar Association ) serve the Federal Reserve international banksters , not We the People .
Prosecutors are co-conspirators with bankers to unlawfully attack and imprison people for bringing up the REAL MONEY issue in court , even though it is the supreme law of the land .
The evidence clearly indicates that there is a nationwide criminal conspiracy of bankers and lawyers to overthrow the united States of America .

REAL MONEY IS GOLD & SILVER COIN
Article I , Section 10 of the united States ' Constitution states : " No State shall ... make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts . "
The united States ' Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land and this Law has never been amended .
Article I , Section 8 states : " The Congress shall have Power ... to coin Money " .
Notice that it states " coin " not " print " .
Anyone who reads James Madison 's notes of the Constitutional Convention , The Federalist Papers , etc. will find that one of the purposes of the Constitutional Convention was to do away with paper money - - entirely !
Thus for the first 72 years from the founding of our nation the united States '
Government only minted gold and silver COINS for money .
" It is apparent from the whole context of the Constitution as well as the history of the times which gave birth to it , that it was the purpose of the Convention to establish a currency consisting of the precious metals .
These were adopted by a permanent rule excluding the use of a perishable medium of exchange , such as of certain agricultural commodities recognized by the statutes of some States as tender for debts , or the still more pernicious expedient of paper currency . "
[ President Andrew Jackson , 8th Annual Message to Congress , December 5 , 1836 ]
" The Central Bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of our Constitution .
I am an enemy to all banks , discounting bills or notes for anything but coin .
If the American people allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency , first by inflation and then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . "
[ Thomas Jefferson ]
The nightmare that Thomas Jefferson predicted became painfully real during the Great Depression when the international banksters caused the foreclosure of untold numbers of homes , farms and businesses .
As the national debt moves exponentially upwards , it appears that we are heading for another economic upheaval .

MARK OF THE BEAST OR RELIGIOUS MANIPULATION ?
Anyone can obtain an official letter from the Social Security Administration stating that the IRS has jurisdiction over the Social Security Administration .
The IRS is merely a corporation used to turn over the labor and possessions of Americans to the international bankers who own the Federal Reserve .
The corporation known as the Social Security Administration is not even based in Washington , DC .
It is based in Baltimore , Maryland and it does not even have government franking privileges .
Currently , in the United States you cannot get a job , bank account , insurance , driver 's license , hunting or fishing license without a Social Security Number .
In other words , you cannot make a living , travel , buy or sell without this number .
Chapter 13 of Revelations states that the Mark of the Beast is a number without which one cannot buy or sell .
Is this the " mark of the beast " or religious manipulation on the part of the powers that be ?
During the Constitutional Convention the delegates used the words " emit bills of credit " to refer to the issuance of paper ( debt - based ) currency .
The framers of the Constitution were so adamant about prohibiting the printing of paper currency that one of the delegates , George Reed of Delaware , exclaimed that if they put the words " emit bills of credit " in the Constitution it would be " as alarming as the mark of the beast in Revelation ! "

WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT ?
1. GET EDUCATED : The first thing anyone can do and should do is to educate oneself on the subject .
The book ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS is a good place to start .
Another source is A PLEA FOR THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES by George Bancroft .
Another highly - recommended book on the subject of the Federal Reserve is THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND by G. Edward Griffin .
2 . There are some great videos that educate people about the Federal Reserve Fraud and the international bankers plan for a cashless society .
Many people today would rather watch a movie than read a book .
CLICK HERE for free video documentation of the Federal Reserve Fraud and other related subjects .
3 . Start using US - minted coins as much as you can to buy goods and services because they are not part of the Federal Reserve system .
Nickel - Copper coins are okay but gold and silver coins are much better .
Remember what Andrew Williams , a spokesman for the Federal Reserve in Washington , D.C. said about Federal Reserve notes :
" There is no law that says goods and services must be paid for with Federal Reserve notes .
Parties entering into a transaction can establish any medium of exchange that is agreed upon . "
" In a time of universal deceit , telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act . "
George Orwell

In Hollywood 's world of air - brushed perfection , Scarlett Johansson 's real - life curves have won her a legion of fans .
Now there is another reason to warm to her .
Like countless women , it seems the 21 - year - old actress has a touch of cellulite .
But she is n't the sort of girl to let a little dimple or two stop her wearing an elegant short dress .
More :
• How a West End show lost Scarlett
Unveiled as the global new face of sportswear firm Reebok , Miss Johansson displayed the dreaded dimpled skin that , it appears , almost no woman is immune from .
Dressed in a skimpy outfit which hid nothing , she exposed her less than perfect thighs at the launch , which is ironically supposed to be based on the actress 's " sporty " look .
In a multi-million pound deal , she will design her own retro-inspired clothing and footwear range which will be known as Scarlett ' hearts ' Rbk .
It is likely that chiefs at the sportswear giant picked the actress for her toned body , which she put on show while playing a tennis player in her recent movie Match Point .
Miss Johansson , who models herself on late curvy icon Marilyn Monroe , does her best to remove herself from the painfully skinny look which many of her peers swear by to get acting work .
Instead the Oscar - winning star says she is determined to keep hold of her curves despite pressure to lose weight .
Talking openly about her twig - like colleagues , she said : " Everyone in Hollywood is so skinny and you 're constantly feeling like you 're not skinny enough . "
The actress even showed off her curves alongside slender British star Keira Knightley when both went naked for the cover of Vanity Fair 's annual Hollywood edition .
Since catapulting to fame in 1998 with her performance in The Horse Whisperer , Miss Johansson has gone on to become one of Hollywood 's most successful young actresses .
In 2004 she won a BAFTA for her lead role in Lost In Translation .
However , while she is a star on the big screen , she has also scooped other fruitful advertising deals , including cosmetic brand L'Oreal , for which she was paid £ 3 million .
