Intel Core 2 Duo E8200
We used the same Corsair XMS2 8500C5 Dominator memory and Nvidia GeForce 8800 Ultra in both systems to maintain consistency .
Extra cooling fans were removed , except for the CPU cooler .
BIOS settings were returned to default on both boards and AMD Cool 'n ' Quiet and Intel EIST / C1E states were enabled , however AMD's " Turbo mode " was left enabled .
We did this because disabling it Phenom performance by massively increasing memory latency some three to four fold ( ~135 -150ns versus ~ 65ns ) , but it greatly increases the energy efficiency of the Phenom processors , however we feel that this in no way represents a system worth using .
Since the quad - core 45nm Yorkfield processors matched the power consumption of the 65nm dual - core parts , it's of no surprise that the power consumption of the C0 45nm Wolfdale parts is better again - in our case keeping the power envelope under 200W even with a high end graphics card and X48 motherboard being used .
Just like the QX9650 and QX9770 the 45nm products are the ones to aim for if you 're considering and Intel upgrade , howeverthe Extreme Edition CPUs , the Wolfdales are .
In fact , every CPU featured was affordable , the only exception is the Q6700 at £ 311 .
If you 're heavily into multi- threaded applications or serious multi-tasking , then a quad - core processor will offer a greater performance and space to breath .
If you 're a gamer though , a high clocked dual - core with plenty of memory bandwidth is certainly the way to go - the Wolfdales will oblige in every aspect .
We still can't recommend the B2 Phenoms - there 's just nothing where they stand out and there is n't a better Intel alternative .
Even in the DivX 6.8 test where the Phenoms outperform the Intel quad - core processors , you still might as well just buy a Wolfdale which is faster , costs the same and uses less power .
In addition , the hassle of having to run Overdrive every time the PC boots and enable " Turbo " mode in Windows Vista x64 SP1 is considerable .
If you have to have a quad - core though , the Q6600 G0 is still a better purchase for a small £ 5 premium .
When it comes to value , the E8400 is the best you 'll get - it 's a 3GHz CPU for under £ 130 !
It 's only £ 20 more than the E8200 and the higher multiplier should make it reach better overclocks without needing a super motherboard .
Compared to even the E6850 at 3GHz , it 's £ 30 less expensive and performs better .
It 's even cheaper than the Q6600 G0 and outperforms it in a number of tests - plus the extra features and cache - per - core are a certain benefit .
Plus , it 'll save you money on your energy bill .
If you really can't stretch for it , the E8200 is still a great purchase instead of the previously popular E6750 which is actually £ 4 more expensive .
It 's only a tad more expensive than the E6550 and AMD Athlon 64 X2 6400 + , but it 'll leave them in the dust in terms of performance .
450MHz FSB on an E8200 should n't be too difficult ( in theory ) on an inexpensive P35 board , and that 'll give a healthy 3.6GHz to play with .
Ignore the E8500 though , the 160MHz speed bump is n't worth the extra £ 50 over the E8400 , and the 0.5 x multiplier may limit your motherboard purchase to those that support it .
If you do n't have it , you 'll just be left with a 9.0 x multiplier , or in effect , a very expensive E8400 .
We 'll see what the B3 Phenoms and even the tri-core Phenom 8000 range brings at a later date , but for now , Intel is onto another winner and this time its in the mainstream where we can all enjoy it .
Understanding the concept of a “ living thing ” is a late developmental achievement .
Early research by Jean Piaget , showed that kids attribute “ life status ” to things that move on their own ( e.g. clouds or bikes ) and even 10 - year - olds have difficulty understanding the scope of a living thing .
New research , supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health , proposes that the way in which “ alive ” and other biological concepts are named within a given language shapes their understanding and acquisition in children .
Northwestern University psychologist Florencia Anggoro , with colleagues Sandra Waxman and Doug Medin , compared 4 - 9 - year - old children speaking English and Indonesian , a pair of languages with an intriguing difference .
In English , but not Indonesian , the name “ animal ” is polysemous , or has more than one meaning : one sense includes all animate objects ( as in , the animal kingdom ) ; the other excludes humans ( as in , ‘ do n’t eat like an animal ! ’ ) .
This polysemy , the researchers say , can make it difficult for children to identify with any precision the scope of the names and their underlying concepts .
If this is the case , then children learning a language without this polysemy should have less difficulty .
Indonesian provides an ideal test : the word “ animal ” is not ambiguous ; it refers exclusively to non-human animals .
To test this theory in the laboratory , Anggoro , who is now at the University of Chicago , and colleagues asked both Indonesian - speaking children and English - speaking children to identify entities that are “ alive ” in a simple sorting task .
Indonesian - speaking children , tested in Jakarta , exhibited little trouble ; they selected both plants and animals .
But , English - speaking children , tested in Chicago , had trouble settling on the scope of the concept , and even at 9 years of age tended to exclude plants .
Thus , the term “ alive ” poses unique interpretive challenges , especially for English - speaking children .
These results , which appear in the April issue of Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , offer insights into how knowledge is shaped by language .
The results also have strong implications for education , “ understanding the conceptual consequences of language differences will serve as an effective tool in our efforts to advance the educational needs of children , including ( but not limited to ) those from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds who are now enrolled in U.S. schools ” says Anggoro .

U.S. Slashes Africa Peacekeeping Funds Proposed cuts are expected to be as deep as 25 percent , officials say .
May 20 , 2008  --
The Bush administration will request no more funding for United Nations peacekeeping efforts , leaving in place proposed cuts expected to be as deep as 25 percent , according to officials and budget documents .
Among the programs facing sharpest cuts are efforts to quell violence in Africa .
When ABC News first reported the proposed cuts in February , the administration contended that it might seek additional funding later in the year .
But officials confirmed last week that they requested no additional funding in their supplemental budget recently submitted to Congress .
" Unless you are expecting the emergence of peace worldwide , " the cuts are hard to understand , Rep. Nita Lowey , D - N.Y. , told a State Department official at a hearing last month on the topic .
Lowey chairs the House appropriations panel which oversees peacekeeping funds .
" We can agree that U.N. peacekeeping operations should be closed down as soon as it makes sense to do so , but do you really expect the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , South Sudan , Liberia and Lebanon to be so dramatically better nine months from now as to justify budget reductions for these missions of 25 to 30 percent ?
I find this hard to believe , " she said .
" It 's a very tight budget year , " conceded Kristen Silverberg , assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs , acknowledging that neither she nor Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice thought the funding request made for " an ideal situation . "
The administration released its proposed peacekeeping cuts days before President Bush was scheduled to make what one paper termed his " victory lap " through the African continent .
White House officials talked up the trip and Bush 's commitment to the continent , telling reporters how the president " really cares about Africa . "
In her testimony , Silverberg said U.S. funding for U.S. peacekeeping operations this year could reach $ 2.1 billion , but the administration had requested less than $ 1.5 billion to cover its share of the costs of U.N. peacekeeping efforts for 2009 .
" [ P ] eacekeeping budgeting is inherently unpredictable , " she told House appropriators .
" We 've never gotten it perfectly right in our request to Congress , and we wo n't this year , I expect . "
When contacted last week , the State Department would make no comments for the record on the proposed cuts other than to confirm them .
They referred the Blotter 's inquiries to Silverberg 's testimony the month before .
In back - to - back testimony before House panels in early April , Silverberg assured lawmakers that while the amount requested was not enough to meet what the United States was likely to be assessed for its share of peacekeeping costs next year , it would at least keep the operations from going broke .
" It would be much better , from our perspective , if the budget situation allowed for something other " than what she termed a " cash - flow management approach , " Silverberg told lawmakers .
But , she said , " This year we think that 's the best we can do . "

If you ever worried that information from a genetic test might be used to deny you a job , insurance or entrance to an elite training school for genetically - engineered astronauts , you can breathe a little easier now .
After a decade of false starts , dead ends and back - room squabbles , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act ( GINA ) was signed into law by President Bush today .
In a nutshell , it prevents employers and insurers from using genetic data against you .
The bill 's co-sponsor , Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , calls it the " the first civil rights legislation of the 21st century . "
Here 's why it matters :
Employers can't deny you a job because you 're genetically predisposed to develop a particular disease or condition .
Insurers can't use your genetic profile to deny coverage or raise your premiums .
Thus protected , you can benefit from medical genetic testing without worrying about the results being used against you .
People will be less reluctant to take part in genetic research .
This will help scientists , and – as the complex interplay between genes , environment and development is better understood – you .
GINA 's not perfect :
The law does n't specifically keep genetic information out of third - party hands .
It also does n't apply to the military .
( So actually , you still might be denied entrance to Gattaca based on a genetic test . )
And some people say health insurance wo n't ever be fair without a pricing structure that makes discrimination impossible .
But until that utopian day arrives , GINA will have to do .
And with Genetics and Public Policy Center director Kathy Hudson calling it " rock solid , " GINA will do quite well .

Louis Vuitton Sues Art Student Who Did Darfur Illustration
Nadia Plesner , a Danish 26 - year - old art student , designed a T - shirt depicting a Darfurian child holding a Louis Vuitton bag with a Chihuahua on his shoulder in the vein of Paris Hilton .
The image was printed on t- shirts to bring about increased attention to the plight of Darfur and the West ’s insistence to trivialize or overlook the issues there .
In February of this year the Marc Jacobs run House of Louis Vuitton issued a copyright lawsuit demanding $ 20,000 a day for each day she continued to use this image and reimbursement for legal fees .
Plesner is scheduled to meet with Louis Vuitton in Paris with her lawyer on May 30th since she refused to comply .
New York Mag has a interview with Nadia Plesner that makes for an interesting read .
While the House of Louis Vuitton is busy spending thousands of dollars suing her instead of capitalizing on the moment by making a donation in her name to charity and realizing that parody / caricature and non competitive market copyright have a considerable barring on this “ copyright ” case .

An carpeter named Ma Yanjun from Qiqiao village , Shaanxi province has invented a solar water heater built from hose pipes and beer bottles .
The bottles are placed on a board in the sun and connected with hose pipes to let cold water to flowing inside .
The water is heated only when the sun rays warm the bottles .
This invention was made for his mother because he did not want her to bathe in cold water in winters .
When talking about mother 's day i will love to gift such thing , and i think that she would be very excited .
Since the price of a water heater is very exorbitant it was too difficult for him to buy a real water heater .
I am very happy when I see that the accustomed people accomplish so large inventions and extra saves the nature .
( The Late ) M.L. King Still Silenced Soon after Martin Luther King Jr. ’s birthday became a federal holiday in 1986 , I began prodding mainstream media to cover the dramatic story of King ’s last year as he campaigned militantly against U.S. foreign and economic policy .

Most of his last speeches were recorded .
But year after year , corporate networks have refused to air the tapes .
Last night , NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams enthused over new color footage of King that adorned its coverage of the 40th anniversary of the assassination .
The report focused on the last phase of King ’s life .
But the same old blinders were in place .
NBC showed young working - class whites in Chicago taunting King .
But there was no mention of how elite media had taunted King in his last year .
In 1967 and ‘ 68 , mainstream media saw Rev. King a bit like they now see Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Back then they denounced King ’s critical comments ; today they simply silence them .
While noting in passing that King spoke out against the Vietnam War , mainstream reports today rarely acknowledge that he went way beyond Vietnam to decry U.S. militarism in general .
“ I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos , ” said King in 1967 speeches on foreign policy , “ without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today – my own government . "
In response to these speeches , Newsweek said King was “ over his head ” and wanted a “ race - conscious minority ” to dictate U.S. foreign policy .
Life magazine described the Nobel Peace Prize winner as a communist pawn who advocated “ abject surrender in Vietnam . ”
The Washington Post could n’t have been more patronizing : " King has diminished his usefulness to his cause , to his country , and to his people . "
When King ’s moral voice moved beyond racial discrimination to international issues , the New York Times attacked his efforts to link the civil rights and antiwar movements .
King ’s sermons on Vietnam could get as angry as those of Barack Obama ’s ex-pastor : “ God did n’t call America to engage in a senseless , unjust war , ” King declared .
“ We ’ve committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world . ” Economic Criticism
In 1967 , King also was criticizing the economic underpinnings of U.S. foreign policy , railing against “ capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia , Africa and South America , only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries . "
Today , capitalists of the West reap huge profits from their domination of global media .
Thankfully , we now have the Internet and independent media outlets where King ’s later speeches are available for the ages .
If King had survived to hear the war drums beating for the invasion and occupation of Iraq – amplified by TV networks and the New York Times front page and the Washington Post ’s editorial page – there ’s little doubt where he ’d stand .
Or how loudly he ’d be speaking out .
And there ’s little doubt how big U.S. media would have reacted .
On Fox News and talk radio , King would have been Dixie Chicked .
. .or Rev. Wrighted .
In corporate centrist outlets , he ’d have been marginalized faster than you can say Noam Chomsky .
One suspects King would be marveling at the rise of Barack Obama and the multiracial movement behind him .
But would he be happy with Obama and other Democratic leaders who heap boundless billions onto the biggest military budget in world history ?
In 1967 , King denounced a Democratic - controlled Congress for fattening the Pentagon budget while cutting anti-poverty programs , declaring : “ A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death . ”
Jeff Cohen is an associate professor of journalism at Ithaca College , and founding director of the Park Center for Independent Media .
He founded the media watch group FAIR in 1986 , and has written and lectured about King ’s life and death for 35 years .

Americans do not have a particularly easy time getting jobs in Canada .
I am not saying it ’s impossible , mind you , just difficult .
But , if you reside in one of the 50 plus countries of the British Commonwealth , you might have a much easier time getting the proper papers to be permitted to stay and work legally in Canada .
Why would you want to do so ?
According to a recent article in the Globe and Mail , so - called “ green jobs ” are proliferating at such a rate there is a veritable shortage of suitable candidates .
It seems that these environmental jobs are not only for scientists anymore .
Canadian employers are targeting multi-taskers , interdisciplinarians and passionate folks who want work to protect the environment as their ideal candidates .
One thing is clear , however , the number of green job opportunities is growing considerably .
According to Grant Trump , president of the Calgary - based Environmental Careers Organization of Canada :
“ The opportunities in environmental careers are exploding .
Demand is outstripping supply and it ’s affecting industry ’s ability to meet the environmental challenge .
Right now , there are 530,000 jobs in Canada related to the environment , and we are projecting job growth over the next five years to increase by 8.8 per cent .
This represents a rate that is 24 - per-cent faster than the overall Canadian employment increase . ”
This Canadian employee shortage might even open the door to more Americans who are actively seeking , but cannot find similar opportunities in a country that is talking a lot about green collar jobs without actually producing many of them .
Speaking from first hand experience , I know that there is a wealth of opportunities in Canada right now in terms of research grants and graduate funding for disciplines in the traditional environmental disciplines as well as some of the less traditional ones .

Caught on camera : A doctor 's miracle escape after she was pushed under a train by a deluded stranger
David Arnold has been detained under the Mental Health Act after he admitted GBH with intent
A doctor escaped death by inches after she was pushed in front of a train by a crazed stranger on an all - day drinking binge .
Shuet Neong , 24 , survived because she slipped between the rails as the passenger train thundered over her .
A judge said it was a ' miracle ' she was not killed by David Arnold , who moments earlier had tried to assault a man with a claw hammer .
Arnold , a 39 - year - old council caretaker , told police he had pushed Dr Neong on to the tracks to show he could do something ' really serious ' after a fight with a colleague .
He was yesterday detained indefinitely for psychiatric treatment after the Old Bailey heard he suffered from a delusional disorder .
He had pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm .
The court heard Dr Neong missed the 750 - volt electrified rail by inches and was then trapped as one - and - a - half carriages of the passenger train passed over her at 20 mph .
After it had stopped commuters heard her screaming and crying and leapt down to pull her to safety .
David Arnold ( circled in yellow ) stands behind a Dr Shuet Neong ( circled in red ) just moments before pushing her under a train
Her collarbone was broken and she was left with multiple cuts and bruises to her face and body .
Arnold fled the scene but later that night walked into Plumstead police station in South - East London and told officers : ' I have pushed someone under a train . '
Oliver Glasgow , prosecuting , said : ' He told the officers he did n't think he was capable of doing something like that and he did n't know why he'd done it and that he was delusional - it was something he was n't in control of .
Dr Neong lies on the track as the train approaches
' He told the community psychiatric team that earlier in the evening he had taken a claw hammer and had gone out and tried to attack a man he 's seen at a bus stop , but having swung , the man ducked and had rushed off . '
Arnold , from Greenwich , South - East London , had been drinking all afternoon with colleagues on October 19 last year and became involved in a fight with another council worker .
Mr Glasgow said he was ' rambling , emotional and so drunk he could not walk without stumbling ' when he left the Old Mill pub in nearby Plumstead .
He went to a friend 's house and then walked to the rail station at Woolwich Arsenal , where Malaysianborn Dr Neong was waiting for a train home after work .
David Arnold calmly walks away after pushing his victim onto the tracks
CCTV images show Arnold lurking in the shadows behind the junior casualty doctor .
Mr Glasgow said : ' As her train pulled into the platform a man stepped from behind her and pushed her into its path .
' The driver was unable to stop before he reached her and the train passed over the top of her . '
Mr Glasgow said that Dr Neong was finding it difficult to work after her ordeal .
Judge Christopher Moss ordered that Arnold be treated at the secure Bracton Clinic in South London until the Home Secretary ruled it was safe to release him .
The 24 - year - old doctor was pushed on the tracks while waiting at Woolwich Arsenal Station
He told Arnold : ' You selected your victim and , in choosing your moment precisely , you deliberately pushed her into the path of a moving train .
' It is a miracle that Dr Neong was not killed . '
> Arnold was not thought to have been previously diagnosed with a mental illness and was not in psychiatric care before the attack .
The judge praised the bravery of train driver Patrick Robinson and commuter Kevin Jobbins , who came to Dr Neong 's aid .
Three F - 16s roared toward Fenway Park , flying wingtip to wingtip .
Suddenly a fourth F - 16 , trailing behind the formation , caught up , flew under the three F - 16s , then looped up and over the formation to take its rightful spot for a perfect V formation .
The maneuver , performed during the Red Sox Opening Day game Tuesday , came just as the Boston Symphony Orchestra finished playing the national anthem .
It elicited roaring applause and cheers from the full - capacity crowd , which clearly appreciated what it thought to be great showmanship .
But as it turns out , the maneuver was improper and the Vermont Air National Guard grounded the pilot this week .
" I understand the crowd liked it , but you wo n't see it again , " said Lieutenant Colonel Lloyd Goodrow , a Guard spokesman .
The pilot , whose name was not released , conducted the maneuver to slow down after he raced to catch up with the formation already in progress , Goodrow said .
But the pilot , he said , was flying at an altitude too low for such a maneuver : about 1,100 feet , rather than the sanctioned 5,000 feet or higher .
" Our highest responsibility is safety , " said Goodrow , although he quickly added : " At no time during the flyover was anyone in jeopardy .
. . .
He 's a very professional pilot , and he was in control of the plane at all times . "
He also emphasized that the maneuver was not acrobatic , as it has been characterized by some spectators .
The pilot 's sudden maneuver concerned at least one fan , Gina Reitano , a 39 - year - old Fall River resident who sat behind the bullpen on Opening Day .
" I thought that maybe he was having trouble with the plane , " said Reitano , noting she has seen four other flyovers previously that did n't include such a dramatic maneuver .
" I did n't think there was any imminent danger but just that maybe something was wrong . "
" The people around me were drunk so they just went , ' Whoaaa , ' " she added .
John Blake , Red Sox spokesman , said the team fielded no complaints about the maneuver and has n't had a chance to talk to the Guard about it .
" I 'm not an expert on flyovers , " Blake said .
" If something was amiss , I would n't have known . "
The pilot will go through remedial training before being allowed to fly again .

I hate to say it , but Ron Paul fans may have a legitimate complaint this time .
Republican Rep. Ron Paul and his supporters are targeting the Fox News network today after an Internet discussion spread during the weekend that the cable network was n’t giving the Texas lawmaker a seat at the table for a New Hampshire forum scheduled two days before the state ’s Jan. 8 primary .
The Associated Press reported last Thursday that the New Hampshire Republican Party would be sponsoring a forum at St. Anselm College in Goffstown , N.H. , with Fox News host Chris Wallace moderating the discussion .
Rudy Giuliani , Mike Huckabee , John McCain , Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson were the only candidates listed as participants , and so the Paul supporters mobilized .
This morning , Washington
Wire received a mass email from an independent Paul supporter calling on his considerable online organization to write to Fox employees and protest the decision .
The email listed the addresses of about 60 Fox employees , from press contacts to hosts Bill O’Reilly , Shepard Smith , Neil Cavuto and Brit Hume .
“ Has Fox News Excluded Ron Paul From the Pre NH Primary Forum ? ” the email said , “ Fox News can not just stifle public opinion .
debate and impact a primary election by excluding Ron Paul just because they do n’t like his message of freedom and liberty , ” the email said ( typos included ) .
Aerospace engineers are again looking to natural flyers to create the next generation in airplanes .
For example :
A Blackbird jet flying nearly 2,000 miles per hour covers 32 body lengths per second but a common pigeon flying at 50 miles per hour covers 75 .
The roll rate of the aerobatic A - 4 Skyhawk plane is about 720 degrees per second .
The roll rate of a barn swallow exceeds 5,000 degrees per second .
Select military aircraft can withstand gravitational forces of 8 - 10 G .
Many birds routinely experience positive G - forces greater than 10 G and up to 14 G .
University of Michigan engineers want to emulate that kind of efficiency and design flapping - wing planes with wingspans smaller than a deck of playing cards .
" Natural flyers obviously have some highly varied mechanical properties that we really have not incorporated in engineering , " said Wei Shyy , chair of the Aerospace Engineering department and an author of the new book " The Aerodynamics of Low Reynolds Number Flyers . "
" They 're not only lighter , but also have much more adaptive structures as well as capabilities of integrating aerodynamics with wing and body shapes , which change all the time , " Shyy said .
" Natural flyers have outstanding capabilities to remain airborne through wind gusts , rain , and snow . "
Shyy photographs birds to help him understand their aerodynamics .
Pressure generated during flight cause the flapping wings to deform , he explained .
In turn , the deformed wing tells the air that the wing shape is different than it appears in still air .
If appropriately handled , this phenomenon can delay stall , enhance stability and increase thrust .
Flapping flight is inherently unsteady , but that 's why it works so well .
Birds , bats and insects fly in a messy environment full of gusts traveling at speeds similar to their own .
Yet they can react almost instantaneously and adapt with their flexible wings .
Shyy and his colleagues have several grants from the Air Force totaling more than $ 1 million a year to research small flapping wing aircraft .
Such aircraft would fly slower than their fixed wing counterparts , and more importantly , they would be able to hover and possibly perch in order to monitor the environment or a hostile area .
Shyy 's current focus is on the aerodynamics of flexible wings related to micro air vehicles with wingspans between 1 and 3 inches .
" These days , if you want to design a flapping wing vehicle , you could build one with trial and error , but in a controlled environment with no wind gusts , " Shyy said .
" We are trying to figure out how to design a vehicle that can perform a mission in an uncertain environment .
When the wind blows , how do they stay on course " "
A dragonfly , Shyy says , has remarkable resilience to wind , considering how light it is .

Before the US House of Representatives , March 13 , 2008
It has been said that " he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword . "
And in the case of Eliot Spitzer this could n’t be more true .
In his case it ’s the political sword , as his enemies rejoice in his downfall .
Most people , it seems , believe he got exactly what he deserved .
The illegal tools of the state brought Spitzer down , but think of all the harm done by Spitzer in using the same tools against so many other innocent people .
He practiced what could be termed " economic McCarthyism , " using illegitimate government power to build his political career on the ruined lives of others .
No matter how morally justified his comeuppance may be , his downfall demonstrates the worst of our society .
The possibility of uncovering personal moral wrongdoing is never a justification for the government to spy on our every move and to participate in sting operations .
For government to entice a citizen to break a law with a sting operation — that is , engaging in activities that a private citizen is prohibited by law from doing — is unconscionable and should clearly be illegal .
Though Spitzer used the same tools to destroy individuals charged with economic crimes that ended up being used against him , gloating over his downfall should not divert our attention from the fact that the government spying on American citizens is unworthy of a country claiming respect for liberty and the fourth amendment .
Two wrongs do not make a right .
Two wrongs make it doubly wrong .
Sacrifice of our personal privacy has been ongoing for decades , but has rapidly accelerated since 9/11 .
Before 9/11 the unstated goal of collecting revenue was the real reason for the erosion of our financial privacy .
When nineteen suicidal maniacs attacked us on 9/11 , our country became convinced that further sacrifice of personal and financial privacy was required for our security .
The driving force behind this ongoing sacrifice of our privacy has been fear and the emotional effect of war rhetoric — war on drugs , war against terrorism , and the war against third world nations in the Middle East who are claimed to be the equivalent to Hitler and Nazi Germany .
But the real reason for all this surveillance is to build the power of the state .
It arises from a virulent dislike of free people running their own lives and spending their own money .
Statists always demand control of the people and their money .
Recently we ’ve been told that this increase in the already intolerable invasion of our privacy was justified because the purpose was to apprehend terrorists .
We were told that the massive amounts of information being collected on Americans would only be used to root out terrorists .
But as we can see today , this monitoring of private activities can also be used for political reasons .
We should always be concerned when the government accumulates information on innocent citizens .
Spitzer was brought down because he legally withdrew cash from a bank — not because he committed a crime .
This should prompt us to reassess and hopefully reverse this trend of pervasive government intrusion in our private lives .
We need no more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act !
No more Violent Radicalization & Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Acts !
No more torture !
No more Military Commissions Act !
No more secret prisons and extraordinary rendition !
No more abuse of habeas corpus !
No more PATRIOT Acts !
What we need is more government transparency and more privacy for the individual !

Contributing Writer , [ GAS ]
This month , we ’re talking cool gadgets – the kind that are so cool that you ’ve just gotta own them .
We introduced our first 10 last week , and today we continue our list with a shocking little invention .
An electrifying number
Whether it ’s sparking your buddy or risking damage to your motherboard , static electricity can cause all sorts of problems .
That ’s where the Static Electricity Eliminator comes into play .
Just carry this 2 ″ gadget around with you and click a switch whenever you need to decharge .
All you have to do is touch its end to any grounded surface and click away , and you ’re safe .
The gadget that ’s all about cool
So long , Calvin Klein – I have found the coolest new fashion trend ever invented .
Behold the USB Air Conditioned Shirt .
USB - powered fans shoot cool air into the places you need it most .
Just sit down , plug in , and cool off .
Or hook up optional AA batteries for on - the - go cooling .
The only size available is a “ Japanese XL , ” so I ’m guessing this baby may run on the small side .
You can snag your own for about $ 160 .
The most annoying gadget ever invented
Let me tell you , the Annoy - a - tron is the best gift you ’ll ever get .
This little guy looks like a computer part .
But flip the switch and slap the magnetic chip onto the back of a coworker ’s PC , and you ’ll witness its true power .
The Annoy - a - tron emits obnoxious high - pitched tones at random intervals , so no one will ever figure out where the noise is coming from .
And believe me , it will drive them crazy .
I speak from personal experience when I say this tiny device can bring much needed joy into any unpleasant job .
Wait … this one is the most annoying
The Phantom Keystroker takes the Annoy - a - tron concept and boosts it up a notch .
It does n’t look like much and will go undetected by most non-IT professionals .
All you do is plug it into someone ’s USB port , and the PK will periodically make a random mouse movement or type some random characters .
You set the frequency , so crank that thing up and watch your coworkers ( or significant other ) squirm .
Wi -fi for everyone to see
This one ’s become a bit of a geek classic , but I could n’t get away with not at least mentioning it .
ThinkGeek ’s come up with a shirt that actually detects wi-fi and displays the signal strength on the front of your shirt .
Great for alternating with the USB air conditioner shirt for maximum fashionability - functionability .
Drink up , my friends
Another of my all - time favorite gadgets is the electronic beverage heater / cooler .
I ’ve got the Sharper Image model that ’s now a bit hard to find , but you can get other USB - powered alternatives in plenty of places .
Slip your can or cup inside and enjoy an icy cold or steaming hot beverage all afternoon .
I use mine almost daily .
Rainy day style
Forget singing in the rain .
With these stylish and feature - filled geek - friendly umbrellas , you can shine in the showers like a diamond in a dump .
The LED Umbrella gives you an angelic glow while keeping you dry , while the Forecasting Umbrella actually tells you when it ’s going to rain .
For $ 80 , get AccuWeather forecasts right in the base of your ‘ brella .
And you thought your raincoat was cool .
I spy , with my two eyes …
Put these shades on and you ’ll give Bond a run for his money .
The 1.3 Megapixel Spy Camera Sunglasses look snazzy , but their best feature is one only you will see .
The glasses have a tiny built - in camera that ’ll capture still images every time you click the accompanying remote .
They also , for some odd reason , play MP3s .
Great for capturing criminal evidence , or , um , other revealing acts .
The foolsafe safe
Some gadgets are pure novelty .
This one is pure utility .
The Hidden Wall Safe looks like a regular electrical outlet , but inside , you can store your most prized possessions ( or an emergency bag of Skittles … either way ) .
You just install it in place of any normal wall outlet , and you have a hidden spot no one will ever suspect .
The safe is 7 ″ high by 3.5 ″ wide and 2.5 ″ deep , and – the best part – is only $ 10 a pop .
The virtual keyboard
Tiny PDA keyboards , be gone .
The Bluetooth Laser Virtual Keyboard projects a QWERTY image on almost any surface , and then lets you type on it .
It even makes little clicky sounds to go with your desk tapping .
Just plug it in to your PDA or regular cell phone , aim it wherever , and fire away .
I do n’t recommend you project on any stranger ’s various body parts , though , no matter how appealing the idea may seem ( believe me , I was thinking that too ) .
HD TV for your pocket
Put this one on your wishlist : the Panasonic Viera P905i .
This thing has a three inch , moveable LCD screen with an impressive 2000: 1 contrast ratio , not a far cry from most full - sized LCDs .
It ’s only for sale in Japan right now , but there , you can hook it up directly to the country ’s mobile broadcast service , flip your screen up , and watch phenomenal definition from anywhere you happen to be .
You can even record shows straight onto the phone .
I ’ve never resented my TiVo more .
The real - world Rosie Jetson ( well , almost )
Mark my words : I will have one of these one day .
The Toshiba ApriPoko Robot is without doubt royalty among gadget peons .
ApriPoko , still under development , is an 11 - inch tall , doe - eyed robot that will learn to do your stuff for you .
Its artificial intelligence ability allows it to literally watch and internalize infrared - related tasks such as controlling your TV .
The robot will see you do something – say , turning on your TV and flipping to a certain channel – then ask you what you ’re doing .
It ’ll then memorize the sequence of infrared commands involved and learn to do them for you via voice command .
This one definitely falls under the category of “ completely unnecessary , ” but hey , so do countless good gadgets .
Now if only it could bring me more Cheetos .
So there you have it : a dozen more cool gadgets to add to your birthday list .
This just barely scratches the surface of the sweet stuff out there , so add on your favorites below .
And feel free to send a complimentary ApriPoko my way , if you are so inclined .
Or at the very least , some crunchy snacks .
The Logical Contracts Server extends the Swish implementation of LPS , with a view towards representing and executing smart legal contracts .
It builds upon several decades of research on the use of logic programming to represent legal documents .
But it also exploits the use of reactive rules and causal laws in LPS to represent obligations and prohibitions .
LPS builds upon the event calculus ontology of events , fluents and time , but using destructive state transitions , without frame axioms .
As argued by van Lambalgen and Hamm , the event calculus provides a useful framework for formalising natural language expressions of tense and aspect .
Logical Contracts aim to exploit this connection between the event calculus and natural language , to provide a simplified natural language representation of contracts .
The examples menu of the Logical Contracts Server contains some preliminary examples of Logical Contracts and their English formulation .
Presented at RuleML+RR 2018 2nd International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning 18 - 21 Sep 2018 , Luxembourg .
The use of logic to improve the analysis and drafting of legal documents was advocated already in the 1950s by the legal theorist Layman Allen .
It was given a boost in the 1980s with the use of logic programming ( LP ) to implement a large portion of the British Nationality Act .
Arguably , since then , LP in one form or another has been the dominant approach to the representation of legal documents in the field of AI and Law .
In the meanwhile , the field of blockchains and smart contracts has emerged , as a separate development from the field of AI and Law .
As a result , there is a large gap between smart contracts implemented in blockchain programming languages , such as Solidity and Serpent , and smart contracts written in the natural language of the law .
The resulting smart contracts are hard to verify and difficult for non-programmers to understand .
The gap between blockchain programming languages and logic - based languages for AI and Law has inspired several recent applications of logic - based AI approaches to the implementation of smart contracts and other legal documents .
In this tutorial , we survey some of these recent developments , focusing on three main examples : the simplified loan agreement developed by Flood and Goodenough , the rock , paper scissors example used in a blockchain lecture course at the University of Maryland , and the delayed delivery example of the Accord Project .
In modal deontic logics , the focus is on inferring logical consequences of obligations , for example on inferring whether an obligation O mail , to mail a letter , logically implies O [ mail or burn ] , an obligation to mail or burn the letter .
Here I present an alternative approach in which obligations are sentences ( such as mail ) in first - order logic ( FOL ) , and the focus is on satisfying those sentences by making them true in some best model of the world .
To facilitate this task and to make it manageable , candidate models are defined by a logic program ( LP ) extended by means of candidate action assumptions ( A ) .
The resulting combination of FOL , LP and A is a variant of abductive logic programming ( ALP ) .
Obligation as Optimal Goal Satisfaction with Ken Satoh , In the Journal of Philosophical Logic , 2018 , 47 ( 4 ) , 579-609 .
Formalising deontic notions , such as obligation , prohibition and permission , is notoriously difficult .
Among the many problems are both the problem of reasoning with conflicting obligations , and the related problem of reasoning with contrary - to - duty obligations , which arise when the violation of a primary obligation p is compensated by a secondary obligation q .
In this paper we propose a formalisation in which obligations are interpreted as goals in abductive logic programming ( ALP ) , and satisfying a goal p is understood as generating a classical , non-modal model that makes p true , where some models may be better than others .
To say that p is obligatory , is to require that p be true in all best models .
To say that p is obligatory , but may be violated , resulting in a less than ideal situation q , means that the real goal is p or q ( equivalently if not p then q ) , and that models in which p is true are better than models in which q is true .
We argue that the ALP approach to the representation of obligations has the advantage that it does not require the invention of a special - purpose logic , but is a general approach , which is suitable for many other applications , including abductive explanations , non-monotonic reasoning , combinatorial optimisation , and reactive systems of the production system variety .
Programming in Logic without Logic Programming with Fariba Sadri , Theory and Practice of Logic Programming , 2016 , 16( 3 ) , 269-295 .
In previous work , we proposed a logic - based framework in which computation is the execution of actions in an attempt to make reactive rules of the form if antecedent then consequent true in a canonical model of a logic program determined by an initial state , sequence of events , and the resulting sequence of subsequent states .
In this model - theoretic semantics , reactive rules are the driving force , and logic programs play only a supporting role .
In the canonical model , states , actions and other events are represented with timestamps .
But in the operational semantics , for the sake of efficiency , timestamps are omitted and only the current state is maintained .
State transitions are performed reactively by executing actions to make the consequents of rules true whenever the antecedents become true .
This operational semantics is sound , but incomplete .
It can not make reactive rules true by preventing their antecedents from becoming true , or by proactively making their consequents true before their antecedents become true .
In this paper , we characterize the notion of reactive model , and prove that the operational semantics can generate all and only such models .
In order to focus on the main issues , we omit the logic programming component of the framework .
Reactive Computing as Model Generation with Fariba Sadri , New Generation Computing , 2015 , 33 ( 1 ) , 33 -67 .
In this paper we propose a logic - based , framework inspired by artificial intelligence , but scaled down for practical database and programming applications .
Computation in the framework is viewed as the task of generating a sequence of state transitions , with the purpose of making an agent 's goals all true .
States are represented by sets of atomic sentences ( or facts ) , representing the values of program variables , tuples in a coordination language , facts in relational databases , or Herbrand models .
In the model - theoretic semantics , the entire sequence of states and events are combined into a single model - theoretic structure , by associating timestamps with facts and events .
But in the operational semantics , facts are updated destructively , without timestamps .
We show that the model generated by destructive updates is identical to the model generated by reasoning with facts containing timestamps .
We also extend the model with intentional predicates and composite event predicates defined by logic programs containing conditions in first - order logic , which query the current state .
History of Logic Programming
Volume 9 , Computational Logic ( Joerg Siekmann , editor ) .
In the History of Logic series , edited by Dov Gabbay and John Woods , Elsevier , 2014 , pp 523-569 .
This history covers some of the highlights of the development of logic programming from the late 1960s into the 21st century .
It focuses on a number of issues that continue to be important today :
the difference between solving a goal by theorem - proving and solving it by model generation ,
the difference between solving a goal top - down and solving it bottom - up , and
the relationship between declarative and procedural representations .
WUENIC :
I worked with WHO and UNICEF from 2009 to 2013 , helping to develop , implement and deploy a set of logical rules to assist in estimating global , country by country , infant immunization coverage .
The problem is to reconcile inconsistencies when different sources of data conflict - for example when government reported data is inconsistent with survey data .
The purpose of the logical rules is to make the reconciliation and estimation process more transparent and more consistent .
The rules have been implemented in XSB Prolog as a purely declarative logic program , and have been used to assist in making the annual estimates since 2010 .
In addition to helping to ensure transparency and consistency , the Prolog implementation has also proved useful in providing detailed documentation of the rationale for each of the estimates .
This has been a huge year for intelligent design research .
We took a look back at some of the most important breakthroughs .
Until recently , Wired has been too hard on the proponents of creationism .
To rectify that , our science desk has hired a full staff of religious zealots .
Here is their first story :
10 . T. rex ate coconuts
According to experts at the Creation Museum , our favorite predatory dinosaur would have fit right in at Whole Foods .
9 . The Earth is only six thousand years old
Carbon - 13 and potassium argon dating are myths created by the devil to cast doubt on the existence of God .
8. Stem Cells are evil
Curing terrible diseases is not worth the trouble of sacrificing some abandoned eggs from the deep freeze at a fertility clinic .
7. NASCAR is the official sport of the spiritually enlightened
Some forms of entertainment were meant for the pure of heart .
6 . Guns were created by God to kill deer
It is our responsibility as humans to encroach on their habitats by building track homes and then blow the sweet crap out of them so that they do n't starve to death in the winter .
5. Liberals are evil
Even though most of the truly bizarre sex scandals have involved republicans , and democrats prefer to have affairs with women of legal age , left - wing politicians are morally more morally bankrupt than their conservative counterparts .
4. Civil Liberties are for sissies
Under the benevolent Bush II theocracy , we do n't need privacy .
Like the Pope , he is in direct contact with God , so we can feel secure knowing that every one of his decisions will be fair .
3. President Bush can look directly into our souls .
Bush II looked directly the soul of Russian President Vladimir Putin and saw that he is a good man !
2. Iraq had ties to Al - Qaeda , was enriching Uranium , and all that jazz .
By bombing Iraq back into the stone age , then occupying it , we have protected our country from terrorism .
Who cares if we destroyed our economy while in the process ?
Dubai is certainly not complaining .
1. Evolution is a myth .
Just ask Ben Stein , evil academics suppress any luminary who dares to question the mounds of evidence that life evolved gradually .
Get your facts straight .
It took seven days to make the earth .
APRIL FOOLS !
Everyone knows that creationists do n't do real research , they just make stuff up !
What do you think are the biggest creationist discoveries of all time ?

A few years ago , I began working toward my retirement goal of being an intolerable old man .
I ’m way ahead of schedule on knowing enough about wine to bore anyone , but classical music has proved much more difficult , largely because no matter how much you listen , it does not get you drunk .
But because my cultural 401 ( k ) depends on being able to cite conductors , orchestras and recording years , I called David Moore , a bassist for the L.A. Philharmonic , and asked him to get me on the road to insufferability .
Moore met me at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and said that , like me , he got into classical music late -- in his case at USC , where he started out majoring in jazz , which he discovered by getting into guitar solos in Rush and Iron Maiden songs .
New York is the center of high culture because its orchestra members keep these kinds of things secret .
His first tip was to tell me not to bother buying a lot of CDs because , unlike with rock bands , the live experience is far more important .
“ The Varese piece had 16 percussion instruments , and you ca n’t capture that in two ear buds , ” he explained .
I ’m not exactly sure what his point was , but I longed to say things like , “ The Varese piece had 16 percussion instruments . ”
When I accused him of just saying this to get me to buy concert tickets , he told me that he never listens to classical recordings at home unless it ’s for work .
Again , the New York guys would keep that quiet .
Moore kept giving me advice on appreciating music , but I did n’t care about that .
I wanted to know how to express snobbishness about it .
“ Knowing Sibelius is Finnish and influenced by natural surroundings can deepen the experience , but you do n’t need to know it ’s cold and dark in Finland to appreciate it , ” he said .
Yes , I do .
This was great advice .
A quick Wikipedia read is always the first step to intolerability .
Advertisement
Sensing my excitement , Moore started to get what I was looking for .
“ If you can refer to recordings or conductors , then you can be elitist and mock me for not knowing that stuff , ” he said .
Check .
“ Also , pronounce composers in their language of origin . ”
Got it .
BAY - toe - fen .
And if people applaud between movements during a concert , I should stare , loudly shush and shake my head in disapproval .
The musicians do n’t mind the clapping , but snotty audience members love to assert their knowledge of classical music etiquette .
When I ’m old enough to have really gotten the hang of this , I ’m sure I ’ll be able to use my phone to excoriate the clappers on an online social network inhabited only by the snotty , old and self - obsessed .
It would still be called Facebook .
After banging out some classical licks on a piano that did seem pretty memorable , Moore invited me to the orchestra ’s performance of Mahler ’s Sixth , with guest conductor Christoph Eschenbach .
Not only was this supposed to be a great performance , but more important , I could tell people , “ I saw Eschenbach do Mahler ’s Sixth . ”
Moore was starting to understand my needs .
But before I went , Moore suggested -- against his earlier advice -- that I actually get the disc and listen to it once or twice .
This could help with my most serious hurdle to remembering any piece I hear live : staying awake .
“ The familiarity of a piece is like a return drive , ” he said .
“ It does n’t feel as long because you recognize the landmarks along the way . ”
Also , during the performance , I could focus on a particular section -- say , the bassists -- to give me something to do with my eyes besides close them .
That ’s when I got the awesome idea for Solid Gold Philharmonic Dancers .
When I got home , I downloaded Leonard Bernstein ’s version of Mahler ’s Sixth and read the Wikipedia entry about the symphony .
This turned out to be really smart because I found out the symphony not only requires a triangle , a glockenspiel and , awesomely , cowbells , but , according to Mahler , a hammer that was to be pounded “ brief and mighty , but dull in resonance and with a nonmetallic character ( like the fall of an ax ) . ”
Somewhere , a child - prodigy percussionist is being yelled at for not pounding a wooden hammer dully enough .
Advertisement
That night , I did a lot of staring at the hammer guy , who , to my delight , was also the triangle and cowbell guy .
And his hammer was this gigantic , Wile E. Coyote - sized mallet that he slammed maybe five times onto this enormous wood chopping block on wheels .
I could n’t decide if I was more delighted by the notion of Eschenbach , who conducts this symphony all over the world , trying to persuade airport security to let him board with his carry - on giant hammer , or the idea that the Philharmonic keeps a giant hammer and table in storage just for Mahler ’s Sixth .
Or that , for the rest of my life , I can talk about the sublime dullness of the hammer , which gets lost on recordings , as soon as Mahler ’s Sixth comes up in conversation .
Which it will .
Because I will bring it up .

A century ago radioactivity was new , exciting and good for you - at least if you believed the people selling radium pendants for rheumatism , all - natural radon water for vigor , uranium blankets for arthritis and thorium - laced medicine for digestion ( you do n't even want to know about the radioactive suppositories ) .
Crazy , huh ?
Until I ran into the fascinating book Living with Radiation , the First Hundred Years , self - published by Paul Frame and William Kolb , I had no idea that radiation was the basis for a huge quack - medicine industry that lasted for decades and took in millions .
Today we know that exposing yourself to radiation is a bad idea .
Even when radiation is used to treat cancer , its deadliness is what does the work , killing cancer cells at a slightly higher rate than normal cells .
But imagine yourself 100 years ago , before many of the first researchers studying radioactivity had died of cancer or other radiation - induced causes .
Electricity had been discovered relatively recently , and it turned out to be perfectly safe in moderation , so why not radiation ?
In fact , early discoveries made plenty of reasonable people think that radiation could be good for you .
Natural hot springs have been used as health spas for thousands of years ; even today , vacationers flock to their healing ( well , maybe ) waters .
When scientists went around with radiation detectors , they discovered that the waters from quite a few well - known hot springs were radioactive .
( Radon gas produced by the decay of thorium and uranium deep in the earth permeates the water at many natural hot springs . )
Since no one really knew what made them healthful , the springs ' radioactivity was as good a guess as any .
Entrepreneurs started bottling the water and selling it as " Radon Water . "
But rivals soon pointed out a problem : Radon 's half - life is just 3.82 days .
By the time the bottle reached the customer , most of the radiation would be gone .
You might go so far as to say that Radon Water was a rip - off , which is exactly the pitch the Radium Ore Revigator company used to sell its " better , " " more scientific " product : a watercooler lined with a serious amount of carnotite , an ore of uranium and radium that undergoes radioactive decay , yielding radon gas .
Storing any water in this cooler overnight would give you fresh , potent , invigorating radon water to drink by morning .
Unfortunately for those who used them , Revigators actually worked .
( Today , of course , we run as fast as we can from radon ; ridding basements of it is a big business . )
Many of the radioactive products marketed at the time , such as uranium blankets , contained radioactive materials , but at such low levels that they probably did little harm to consumers .
But over time , companies started producing ever more powerful devices , most of them based on radium , the element with the strongest marketing appeal .
The supremely scary Radiendocrinator was a 2 - inch by 3 - inch case that contained paper infused with 250 microcuries of radium , enough to illuminate a fluorescent screen placed near it .
It was meant to be placed over - the very thought makes me shudder - the endocrine glands .
As the industry developed , it gave birth to the inevitable wave of fraudulent products - fraudulent in the sense that they did not emit the high levels of radiation they claimed to .
This led to a couple of the more surreal aspects of the whole episode : advertisements that positively guaranteed that a company 's products exposed you to the full dose of radiation promised , and instances of the government shutting down companies selling perfectly safe phony products instead of the real ( deadly ) items they claimed to be offering .
For example , the Bailey Radium Laboratories of East Orange , New Jersey , offered $ 1,000 to anyone who could prove that its " Certified Radioactive Water , " sold under the brand name Radithor , did not contain the large amount of radium and thorium it claimed to .
Alas , Radithor was the real thing :
No one ever claimed the prize .
But Radithor did claim at least one life , that of the well - known industrialist , playboy and three - bottle - a- day Radithor user Eben Byers .
Byers 's gruesome death in 1932 inspired the Wall Street Journal headline " The Radium Water Worked Fine until His Jaw Came Off . "
Byers 's death also prompted the newly formed FDA to crack down on radioactive health products , insisting on proof of their safety and effectiveness .
Since they were neither , this had the effect of putting manufacturers out of business .
Although low - radioactivity devices continued to slip through regulatory cracks until well into the 1960s , the era of dangerously radioactive quack cures essentially went to the grave with Eben Byers .
The radium mania was a crazy little episode in the world of medicine , but it was not at all out of the ordinary .
Pain and suffering have always helped foster an uncritical market for remedies and preventatives .
Quacks and profiteers are quick to pick up on the latest discoveries and promote them to the desperate - for - a - cure market , regardless of how remote the connection between the discovery and any likely health benefits might be .
Irradiating yourself in the hope of feeling better was no nuttier than , say , drinking a few teaspoons of plain water as medicine , which is called homeopathy and is extremely popular today .
These fads , old and new , tend to make remarkably similar claims , using the same arguments and marketing methods .
Take a look , for instance , at the following passage , from a 1928 Radium - ore Revigator brochure , and see if it has a familiar ring :
Is radio-activity dangerous to the health ?
Most everyone offers this questions [ sic ] because it is only natural to regard this as a drug or medicine .
The answer is that radio- activity is not a medicine or drug , but a natural element of water , and that since practically all spring and well water that Nature herself gives for drinking purposes contain this highly effective beneficial element , it is but common sense to restore it to water that has lost it just as we restore oxygen to a stuffy room by opening a window .
. . .
The United States Government says that the radio-activity of natural water is never strong enough to be injurious .
In short , ( 1 ) what we 're selling is " natural , " unlike those potent medicines your doctor prescribes ; ( 2 ) maybe you are not getting enough of this natural substance ; and ( 3 ) the government has n't stopped us ( yet ) .
Remember , they 're talking about radon gas .
You could find a paragraph almost identical to this one in any health food store today .
Here 's an example taken from the Web site of a more contemporary product designed to help your , um , vigor :
Is Nymphomax safe ?
Because Nymphomax is an all natural nutritional supplement containing only the finest botanicals , there are no harmful side effects when taken as directed .
Nymphomax is not a pharmaceutical drug and contains none of the synthetic chemicals found in prescription medications .
It is a safe alternative to prescription drugs , which can sometimes have serious side effects .
Now , I 'm not saying herbal medicines are as harmful as radiation , simply that promoting them as " all natural " tells you absolutely nothing about whether they are safe , effective , both or neither .
What matters is what 's in the pill , not how it got there .
There may be all kinds of herbal medicines that are safe and effective - just do n't expect the industry , or the government , to tell you which ones .
Amazingly , current federal law ( the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ) specifically orders the FDA to keeps its hands off virtually all herbal medicines , preventing it from regulating the claims , ingredients or safety of these preparations and forbidding it to require the tracking of side effects and deaths caused by them .
And although the FDA banned ephedra after several high - profile deaths , it will probably take many more such tragedies before the law is changed to allow the agency to clamp down on other dangerous products .
Radon
Water was harmless because it contained nothing , the radiation having vanished before it reached customers .
Amusingly , this has an exact analogue in modern homeopathic remedies .
Homeopathy " works " by dilution : Preparations of powerful substances are diluted , then diluted again and again and again until there is almost no chance that even a single molecule of the original substance remains in the final " medicine . "
These nostrums are sold to the public at top dollar , labeled with their original starting - point ingredients just as if they still contained any of them .
So do n't for a minute think that we 're all smarter and more modern than those idiots eating radium 100 years ago : Homeopathy is a huge industry today , and it is every bit as nutty .
Once people suspend their critical thinking skills and go for hope over reality , the sky 's the limit in silly and dangerous medicine .
A handful of über - programmers are immediately recognizable to most software developers , often on a first - name basis — the way that other communities might recognize " Britney " or " Oprah " without further explanation .
These individuals shape the way programmers design and build applications , by identifying process improvements or designing life - changing tools .
One unquestioned person on that list is Grady Booch .
His primary influence on object - oriented programming was as an original developer of the Unified Modeling Language ( UML ) ; he 's also written several influential books , such as Object - Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications .
And he 's been chief scientist at Rational ( now part of IBM ) since its founding in 1980 ; the most recent formal title is chief scientist for software engineering in IBM Research .
Here 's his advice about making big software development projects a success .
1 . The fundamentals never go out of style .
Big , long projects can become grim , and in the worst cases they can appear to become a death march .
But hyper - productive projects , says Booch , never forget the four fundamentals :
Create crisp and resilient abstractions .
Maintain a good separation of concerns .
Create a balanced distribution of responsibilities .
Focus on simplicity .
The key in creating useful abstractions , says Booch , is to use an object - oriented view of the world , rather than an algorithm - based viewpoint .
Think about things , he says , instead of processes .
Separation of concerns , says Booch , means , " You do n't put the dishwasher in the bathroom . "
The specifics depend on the requirements , but he advises , " Semantically related things should be clustered together and kept separate where they are not . "
Design fundamentals also include avoiding an architecture that 's too " lumpy . "
You do n't want to design a house with an enormous kitchen but just one bedroom , for instance .
Do n't underestimate the importance of keeping things simple , he warns — or the difficulty of getting there .
" It requires energy to develop simple things , " explains Booch .
It 's worth the investment to ensure that every software release includes a step in which developers give attention to simplifying , he says .
But it is an investment .
Management has to be willing to throw out features even if it cost money to develop them .
2 . You need a regular rhythm of releases .
Every project needs a heartbeat , says Booch .
" Establishing that rhythm provides predictability and sustainability . "
Regularity lets everyone plan on what functionality or features will be injected into the next round , he says , regardless of release frequency .
3. Focus upon growing executable architectures .
IT managers need to govern around the architectural decisions rather than raw , running , naked code .
" The code is the truth , " Booch says .
" But the code is not the whole truth . "
4. Create social structures that encourage innovation while still preserving predictability .
Teamwork is an essential ingredient in any large software project , so companies should give attention to creating relationships that work .
Businesses need predictability ( when will this software really ship ? ) and they also want innovation ( make it do something cool ! ) .
Building a social structure to support both those goals is n't necessarily easy , but the successful projects find a balance .
One long - standing point of contention is the degree to which , in those social structures , the manager is a participant in the actual software development process .
The architect should also be an implementer , says Booch , even if a line is drawn between development and managers .
But there 's a danger of noisy communication when management gets too involved ; it 's the difference between a line and a wall .
Another component to creating innovative teams , says Booch , is keeping developers out of " blasted meetings " so they can get things done .
Creating a workable social structure is harder when team members are temporally and geographically dispersed .
Booch pointed to IBM 's research project , BlueGrass : Virtual Worlds for Business , which is taking a stab at a solution by providing social interaction for " heads - up " work — mimicking hallway chats and water cooler meetings .
The aim , says the BlueGrass site , is to provide people with more visibility into the presence and work of people on the distributed team , and to support brainstorming with simple creation of objects in the world .
His own advice :
Get people together in virtual meeting places if you can't get them together in the same time zone .
You need to create places where the opportunity for trust can be created .
It should be okay to talk about your dog in the developer chat room , he says ; if teams are fostered well , eventually work really will be accomplished .
5 . Have fun .
That 's not simply friendly advice ; Booch believes that successful projects come from teams that are jazzed about what they 're doing .
" Most people want to build beautiful , elegant things , " he says .
" If you rob them of that , you 're taking away the passion of the craftsman . "
当サイトでは、口コミや評判の高い食材宅配の体験談レビューやリアルな感想を紹介しています。
食材宅配の選び方を中心に品揃えや価格、送料、料理キット（ミールキット）、離乳食、配送方法など各社比較し、どんな食材宅配サービスがあるのか、どの宅配を選べば良いのか、分かりやすく解説した食材宅配初心者向けのサイトとなっています。
まずは、食材宅配の基礎知識や初心者の方でも失敗しない食材宅配の選び方、実際に筆者がお試しセットを取り寄せたからこそ自信を持っておすすめする食材宅配サービスを見ていきましょう！
食材宅配の基礎知 識
食材宅配はカタログやインターネットから注文し、定期的に自宅へ食材を届けてくれる宅配サービスです。
野菜や果物、お肉・魚、料理キット（ミールキット）、離乳食作りに使える時短アイテムから日用品まで幅広い商品を取り扱っており、近所のスーパーへ買い物に行かなくても卵、牛乳、お菓子、冷凍食品などが簡単に購入できます。
西友やイトーヨーカドー、イオンなどが提供するネットスーパーとの違いは、大きく分けて3つ。
放射能検査・残留農薬検査・添加物使用制限など、
鮮度・安全性・品質にこだわった食品を販売 している
している スーパーには出回らないような安全・新鮮な食材や希少性のある珍しい食材が買える
定期的に自宅へ届けてくれる
ネットスーパーと比較して、安全性・鮮度が圧倒的に高いです。
さらには、買い物・料理の時間がないときや料理が面倒なときに活用できるミールキットや食材キットが豊富で、忙しい主婦にとって非常に便利な商品がたくさん。
特に、赤ちゃんや子育て世帯の30代〜40代主婦を中心に利用されており、女性の社会進出に伴い共働きや一人暮らしの利用者も年々増加しています。
忙しい主婦や一人暮らし、高齢者などのニーズに合った商品を取り揃える食材宅配はとても利用価値の高いサービスです。

食材宅配の選び 方
初めて食材宅配を利用する方は 「 どの宅配を選べば良いのか 」
「どの情報を見れば良いのか」、選び方がわからない方も多いハズ。確かに似たようなサービスが多く、筆者もかなり迷いました。
そこでまずは、食材宅配サービスの失敗しない3つの選び方を見ていきましょう！
取扱い商品の豊富さで選ぶ
取扱い商品は各社それぞれ異なり注力する商品ジャンルも異なるので、欲しい商品の品揃えが豊富なサービスを選ぶと失敗しません。
例えば、離乳食期の赤ちゃんがいる主婦なら離乳食作りに使える食品やうらごし野菜などが豊富な食材宅配を、共働きで毎日仕事＆家事に忙しい主婦なら夕食を時短で作れる料理キット（ミールキット）が豊富な食材宅配を選ぶといいでしょう。
取扱い商品を知るなら、公式サイトやネットの口コミ・評判を見るのはもちろんですが、各社提供している お試しセット を利用するのが一番です。お試しセットなら各社の人気商品をお得な価格で試せます。

⇒商品の種類や品揃えを比較
生活リズムに合ったサービスで選ぶ
配達方法や配送時間、配送エリアなどをチェックしてライフスタイルや生活リズムに合った食材宅配サービスを選ぶのも大切です。
例えば、平日の受け取りが難しい一人暮らしの社会人なら受取日時指定や土日配送が可能な食材宅配を、日中外出することが多い子育てママなら不在時の留め置きOKな食材宅配を、毎週利用しない方は宅配頻度や休止が自由にできる食材宅配を選ぶといいでしょう。
特に、時間に融通の効かない共働きや一人暮らしの方は、受取日時指定可能や土日配送可能、夜21時まで配達可能などの配達方法が充実しているサービスを選ぶと失敗しないでしょう。
⇒配達方法や配送エリアや送料を比較
送料や価格で選 ぶ
毎月の食費の予算内で利用するなら、商品の価格帯や送料を比較して選ぶことも大切です。
商品の値段や送料は各社異なり、特に食材宅配が取り扱う有機野菜・卵・牛乳などはスーパーよりも２〜３倍ほど高め。その中でも安い価格の食材を取り扱っているサービスや送料無料のサービスもあります。また、入会費や年会費の価格も各社異なるので、無理なく続けられる価格帯の食材宅配を選んでくださいね。

食材宅配のメリット・デメリット
食材宅配サービスには、利用するメリットもあればデメリットもあります。あなたが食材宅配を使う前にメリットもデメリットも両方知っておくとギャップを感じることなく利用することができます。
食材宅配のメリットとデメリットを順に確認していきましょう。
メリット
食材宅配サービスのメリットは以下の通りです。
買い物へ行かなくても自宅に商品が届く 有機野菜や無農薬野菜、無添加食品など安心安全な食品が買える
スーパーでは買えない珍しい野菜や希少な野菜が買える
忙しい方や料理が苦手な方でも簡単に料理が作れる 無駄遣いがなくなる
食材宅配の最大のメリットは、買い物へわざわざ行かなくても欲しい商品が自宅に届くことです。お米や飲料など持ち運びが大変な食材を購入するとき、雨の日や夏の暑い日にも出掛けなくていいので便利です。
無農薬・無化学肥料の有機野菜や無農薬野菜はスーパーではなかなか買えませんが、食材宅配なら簡単に手に入り、安全性の高い食材を購入できます。
短時間で栄養バランスの摂れた料理が作れる料理キットは、共働きや子育て＆家事に忙しい主婦、一人暮らしの食事を手助けしてくれます。
食材宅配はスーパーよりも価格が高めですが、毎回考えて注文するのでスーパーだとついつい買ってしまう不要なものを購入する頻度が減り、結果的に食費の節約になります。
デメリッ ト
食材宅配サービスのデメリットは以下の通りです。
食材の価格が高い 入会費や年会費、送料がかかる 商品が届くまでに時間がかかる 食材を手にとって確認できな い
食材宅配サービスは、既存スーパーと比較して価格が高いです。例えばスーパーで売られているキャベツは1玉213円ですが、オイシックスでは1玉388円で売られており、2倍ほど価格が異なります。食材価格だけでなく、入会費や年会費などの利用料が必要なサービスが多く、送料も地域や価格によってそれなりにかかります。
食材宅配は注文した商品が届くのは3日〜1週間ほどかかり、今すぐ使いたい食材がある場合はスーパーやネットスーパーの方が便利です。
また、スーパーなら食材を手にとって重さや見た目、形などを確認して自分で選ぶことができますが、食材宅配はそれができません。1枚の写真や産地、生産者情報を見て選ぶことになるので、実際に食材を触って購入したい方は不向きかもしれません。
このように便利な食材宅配サービスでもデメリットはありますが、利便性・安全性のメリットを考えると利用価値の高いサービスと言えます。
食材宅配が向いている人・向いていない人
食材宅配サービスは上記で紹介したようにメリットもデメリットもあるので、食材宅配が向いている人もいれば向いていない人もいます。
■食材宅配が向いている人 仕事や家事、育児で買い物に行く時間が取れない人
値段よりも安全性を重視する人
赤ちゃんや小さなこどもに安心安全な食材を食べさせたい人
新鮮で美味しい旬の野菜や無添加の食べ物を食べたい人
一人暮らしで外食中心の偏った食生活を改善したい 人
忙しくても栄養バランスのとれたきちんとした食事をとりたい人
以上のような人が食材宅配に向いています。いつも忙しい主婦や子供のために安心安全な食材にこだわりたい主婦、栄養バランスの良い食事をとりたい一人暮らしや高齢者など、共働きで時間がないけど栄養バランスのとれた食事を楽しみたい人におすすめです。
■食材宅配が向いていない人 安全性や栄養よりも値段を重視する人
自分で手にとって食材を選びたい人
今すぐ食材を届けて欲しい人
以上のような人が食材宅配に向いていないです。向いている人とは逆で、街のスーパーやネットスーパーで代用できちゃいますよね。そんな人は食材宅配サービスのデメリットが大きく感じます。
街のスーパーやネットスーパーと食材宅配を併用する人も多いです。例えば、今すぐ食材が欲しい時やお菓子・アイスなどを買う時はスーパー、夕食に使う野菜や肉を買うときは食材宅配にするなど上手く使い分けられますよ。100％食材宅配に頼るのではなく、両方を上手く活用すると上手な買い物ができますね。

From the WSJ : FDIC Readies for a Rise in Bank Failures ( hat tip Peter )
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is taking steps to brace for an increase in failed financial institutions as the nation 's housing and credit markets continue to worsen .
FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray said the agency was looking to bulk up " for preparedness purposes . " ...
The agency , which insures accounts at more than 8,000 financial institutions , is also seeking to hire an outside firm that would help manage mortgages and other assets at insolvent banks , according to a newspaper advertisement .
...
" Regulators are bracing for well over 100 bank failures in the next 12 to 24 months , with concentrations in Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio , and the states that are suffering severe housing - market problems like California , Florida , and Georgia , " said Jaret Seiberg , Washington policy analyst for financial - services firm Stanford Group .
from the FDIC
Semiannual Report
: Economic Conditions and Emerging Risks in Banking
Small and mid-size institutions have been increasing their concentrations in riskier assets , such as CRE loans and construction and development ( C&D ) loans .
This suggests that , although small and mid-size institutions have been more successful in limiting the erosion of their nominal NIMs , they have achieved this success in part by assuming higher levels of credit risk .
... continued increases in concentrations and reports of loosened underwriting standards at FDIC - insured institutions signal the potential for future credit quality deterioration .
In addition , regulators have noted increasing C&D and overall CRE loan
concentrations , especially at institutions with total assets between $ 1 billion and $ 10 billion .
Four of six Regional Risk Committees expressed some level of concern about CRE lending , in part due to continuing increases in concentrations .
Frequent contributor FFIDC has mentioned these hiring efforts for months in the comments .
I expect quite a few bank failures over the next couple of years , mostly due to bad Construction & Development ( C&D ) and Commercial Real Estate ( CRE ) loans .
Look at the concentration of C&D loans in late 2006 ( ) : And that was in late 2006 ; C&D and CRE lending really went crazy in 2007 .

" Ninety percent of inmates who enter Angola [ Louisiana State Penitentiary ] , never leave , " Ross says .
Inmates work on the prison farm and are not allowed to eat the cows they raise because the quality of the meat is too high .
Meals at Angola can cost as little as 17 cents per person since so much of the food is grown on site .
Twice a year , inmates enjoy a rodeo on the prison grounds with barbecues and bull riding .

The pope ’s US visit : Media , White House , Congress embrace spokesman for religious obscurantism
By Patrick Martin
21 April 2008
It is a measure of the profound decay of American democracy that when the president of the United States welcomed the Roman Catholic pontiff to Washington last week , a major concern was that the representative of a 2,000 - year - old religious institution , steeped in reaction and hostility to science and human progress , might seem to criticize the US government from the left .
As it turned out , however , the Bush administration had nothing to fear from Benedict XVI .
In a series of events in Washington and New York City , including an official welcome at the White House , the pope made no reference to the crimes perpetrated by the US government : the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the indefinite detention and torture of prisoners at Guantanamo and secret CIA - run prisons , and the government ’s adamant support for the death penalty .
Instead , Benedict took center stage in a political charade as Bush hailed him as a “ man of peace ” and advocate of “ the weakest and most vulnerable . ”
The US president embraced the pope as an ideological soul mate .
“ In a world where some no longer believe that we can distinguish between simple right and wrong , we need your message to reject this dictatorship of relativism , ” he said .
The instigator of the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq , which has cost the lives of more than one million Iraqis , as well as thousands of Americans , continued : “ In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded , we need your message that all human life is sacred . ”
The pontiff ’s six - day visit has received saturation coverage in the American media , of a largely fawning character .
The only “ negatives ” have been the references to the sex abuse scandal involving thousands of American priests , which the pope was compelled to address directly on several occasions , in large measure because of threats of demonstrations and disruptions by victims of the abuse if he did not .
Both the official sponsorship of the pope ’s visit and the endless media coverage serve a major political purpose of the American ruling elite — to reinforce the role of religion in American public life and further erode the traditional separation of church and state , a major bulwark of democratic rights .
Besides the reception at the White House , there was a celebratory resolution adopted by Congress — after a brief squabble that compelled deletion of praise for the pope ’s anti-abortion stance — and the virtual shutdown of Capitol Hill the day of the outdoor mass at the Washington Nationals baseball stadium , attended by well over 100 senators and congressmen .
One of the pope ’s major themes in addresses in both Washington and New York City was to uphold the authority of Roman Catholic doctrine against what he described as “ the subtle influence of secularism , ” by which he meant all efforts to oppose religious obscurantism in such areas as abortion , procreation , marriage and family life .
In remarks to Catholic bishops at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington , he warned , “ In the United States , as elsewhere , there is much current and proposed legislation that gives cause for concern from the point of view of morality . ”
This was a reference to abortion , gay rights and stem cell research , among other issues where the Catholic Church has sought to impose its dogmas through political agitation bordering on subversion — most recently in Spain , where the Catholic bishops have fueled a movement , so far unsuccessful , to bring down the government of Socialist Party Prime Minister Zapatero .
The pope declared that “ any tendency to treat religion as a private matter must be resisted . ”
This statement has remarkable implications .
It flatly rejects the principles of religious tolerance and state neutrality toward religious belief on which the United States was founded , and suggests that Roman Catholic doctrine should be enacted by legislative fiat wherever possible .
In a separate address to officials of Catholic colleges and universities , Benedict demanded greater conformity with Church doctrine , asserting that “ any appeal to the principle of academic freedom in order to justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church would obstruct or even betray the university ’s identity and mission . ”
This was not only a demand that professors and theologians at Catholic colleges — traditionally independent of the authority of US bishops — toe the Vatican line .
It was also a veiled rebuke to those Catholic schools that have permitted rallies or other public events for political candidates , usually Democrats , who support abortion rights and gay marriage .
Before assuming the papacy in 2005 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was known as the “ pope ’s rottweiler ” for his role as the enforcer of doctrinal orthodoxy and submission to papal authority under his predecessor , John Paul II .
He supervised a systematic purge from the Catholic hierarchy of any trace of liberalism or sympathy with popular social struggles .
On Saturday , Benedict addressed the United Nations General Assembly — in his capacity as ruler of Vatican City , a UN member state — and warned that modern technology and science , with such advances as cloning and stem cell research , risked violating “ the order of creation . ”
He questioned the notion that human rights should be based on international law and constitutional principles , saying that they are not man-made , but “ are based on the natural law inscribed on human hearts . ”
The pontiff , of course , did not bother to square this professed devotion to human rights and the Catholic hierarchy ’s long record of support for repressive , dictatorial regimes which safeguarded the wealth of the Church , for many centuries the world ’s largest property owner .
In his remarks to the UN body , Benedict embraced the doctrine of “ humanitarian intervention , ” advanced by advocates of a more aggressive UN role in Darfur and utilized by American officials to justify , at least retrospectively , their invasion and conquest of Iraq .
“ Every state has the primary duty to protect its own population from grave and sustained violations of human rights , ” he declared .
“ If states are unable to guarantee such protection , the international community must intervene with the juridical means provided in the United Nations charter and in other international instruments . ”
The pope rejected the argument that such international intervention was “ an unwarranted imposition or a limitation of sovereignty , ” adding , “ On the contrary , it is indifference or failure to intervene that does the real damage . ”
Coming only two days after Benedict ’s public embrace of George W. Bush — and complete silence on US war crimes in Iraq — this suggestion that “ failure to intervene ” is the greater evil had definite political connotations .
The papal visit had one major institutional crisis to deal with — the long - running scandal over the sexual abuse of children by thousands of Roman Catholic priests .
This dimension of the visit brought another display of media adulation and ideological reaction .
The press portrayed Benedict — who adamantly rebuffed sex abuse victims for years while serving John Paul II — as deeply moved by their suffering .
In his initial remarks about the scandal , however , as he flew to the US on board his personal jet , the pope bemoaned only the damage done to the Church , not to the victims themselves .
The US Catholic Church has paid out more than $ 2 billion in legal settlements to some 13,000 victims , including $ 660 million in the Los Angeles diocese alone , and several dioceses have been compelled to file for bankruptcy .
The pope ’s closed - door meeting with five sex - abuse victims was presented by Church officials and the media as a major breakthrough , although the five had been carefully vetted by the Boston archdiocese to ensure a relatively harmonious session .
A spokesman for the archdiocese said the five had “ ongoing relationships ” with archdiocesan officials , and had “ stayed engaged with the office ” — i.e. , they had remained loyal to the hierarchy despite the Vatican ’s continued defense of Cardinal Bernard Law .
As Boston archbishop , Law protected priest - abusers and allowed them to transfer from parish to parish when exposed , rather than removing them from the priesthood .
Benedict even sought to blame the sex - abuse scandal on the excessive sexual permissiveness of modern culture , rather than the repressive practice of priestly celibacy which the Catholic Church , alone of major religious institutions , continues to enforce .
Similar sex - abuse cases have been reported in countries as diverse as the United States , Poland , Mexico , Ireland and Austria .
This suggests that the common denominator is not the culture of the specific countries , but the atmosphere prevalent within the Catholic Church as an institution .
As the World Socialist Web Site noted when the sex abuse scandal in the United States first came to widespread public attention , some six years ago , “ Every aspect of the sexual abuse crisis — the pain and suffering of the victims , the misery and sexual dysfunction of the priests , the callousness of Church officials — suggests a diseased institution whose practices and beliefs run counter to elementary human needs and inevitably breed the unhealthiest of psycho-sexual climates .
The Catholic Church ’s essential being flies in the face of modern society . ”
A NEWPORT man was electrocuted by an 11,000 volt cable as he tried to steal copper from an electricity substation on Saturday .
Workers at Panteg steelworks found the man 's body at around 11.30 am on Saturday .
He was in his early forties and was identified by police , but has not yet been named .
The dead man was found on a narrow footpath which runs alongside the steelworks ' perimeter fence .
Detectives believe he was electrocuted sometime after 9 am on Saturday morning , as he and two other Newport men tried to steal copper from an electricity substation on the site in broad daylight .
The live cable he is thought to have stripped was carrying a lethal 11,000 volts of electricity .
A post -mortem will be carried out today .
Officers sealed the site , off Station Road near the Griffithstown railway museum , on Saturday and called in a Home Office pathologist .
Police have also tracked down the two Newport men who were with the man .
They are now helping police with their inquiries .
Detective Chief Inspector Steve Mogg told the Argus that Gwent has seen an explosion in copper thefts during the last 12 to 18 months .
Terrifyingly , officers arriving to investigate this electrocution found two other men making an unrelated attempt to steal copper from the Panteg site , and arrested them .
" People are putting their lives at risk for a few quid , " he said .
" We have seen one or two injuries over the last 12 months .
" Now , tragically , we have had a death . "
It is believed to be the first fatality of its kind in Gwent .
Recently the price of metals , including copper used in cabling , has soared and thieves are targeting industrial sites and electricity substations before selling on the metal to scrap dealers .
They remove the plastic coating from the cable , then strip the copper - despite the fact it may be insulating a live wire .
DCI Mogg warned : " This is extremely dangerous .
We need to tackle not just the thieves , but the dealers they sell to . "
Police are appealing for witnesses who saw anything suspicious between 6 am and 10 am on Saturday to call Gwent Police on 01633 838111 .
Fourteen months into a campaign that has the feel of a movement , Sen. Barack Obama has collided with the gritty political traditions of Philadelphia , where ward bosses love their candidates , but also expect them to pay up .
The dispute centers on the dispensing of “ street money , ” a long - standing Philadelphia ritual in which candidates deliver cash to the city ’s Democratic operatives in return for getting out the vote .
Flush with payments from well - funded campaigns , the ward leaders and Democratic Party bosses typically spread out the cash in the days before the election , handing $ 10 , $ 20 and $ 50 bills to the foot soldiers and loyalists who make up the party ’s workforce .
It is all legal -- but Obama ’s people are telling the local bosses he wo n’t pay .
Advertisement
That sets up a culture clash , pitting a candidate who promises to transform American politics against the realities of a local political system important to his presidential hopes .
Pennsylvania holds its primary April 22 .
Obama ’s posture confounds neighborhood political leaders sympathetic to his cause .
They caution that if the senator from Illinois withholds money that gubernatorial , mayoral and presidential candidates have willingly paid out for decades , there could be defections to Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York .
And the Clinton campaign , in contrast , will oblige in forking over the money , these ward leaders predict .
“ We ’ve heard directly from the Obama organizer who organizes our ward , and he told us it ’s an entirely volunteer organization and that I should not expect to see anything from the Obama campaign other than ads on TV and the support that volunteers are giving us , ” said Greg Paulmier , a ward leader in the northwest part of the city .
Neither the Clinton nor the Obama campaign would say publicly whether it would comply with Philadelphia ’s street money customs .
But an Obama aide said Thursday that it had never been the campaign ’s practice to make such payments .
Rather , the campaign ’s focus is to recruit new people drawn to Obama ’s message , the aide said .
Advertisement
The field operation “ has n’t been about tapping long - standing political machinery , ” the aide said .
Carol Ann Campbell , a ward leader and Democratic superdelegate who supports Obama , estimated that the amount of street money Obama would need to lay out for election day is $ 400,000 to $ 500,000 .
“ This is a machine city , and ward leaders have to pay their committee people , ” Campbell said .
“ Barack Obama ’s campaign does n’t pay workers , and I guarantee you if they do n’t put up some money for those street workers , those leaders will most likely take Clinton money .
It wo n’t stop him from winning Philadelphia , but he wo n’t come out with the numbers that he needs ” to win the state .
A neutral observer , state Rep. Dwight Evans , whose district is in northwest Philadelphia , said there might be a racial subtext to the dispute .
Ward leaders , he said , see Obama airing millions of dollars worth of television ads in the city -- money that benefits largely white station owners , feeding resentment .
People wonder why Obama is n’t sharing the largesse with the largely African American field workers trying to get him elected , Evans said .

“ They view it that the white people are getting all the money for TV , ” said Evans , an African American and former ward leader .
“ And they ’re the ones who are the foot soldiers on the street .
They ’re predominantly African Americans , and they ’re not the ones who are getting that TV money . ”
Hardscrabble neighborhoods across the city have come to depend on street money as a welcome payday for knocking on doors , handing out leaflets and speaking to voters as they arrive at polling places .
Peter Wilson , a ward leader from West Philadelphia , said : “ Most of the ward leaders , we live in a very poor area , and people look forward to election days .
. . .
People are astute .
They know the Obama campaign has raised millions of dollars . ”
Street money is an enduring political practice in Philadelphia and cities including Chicago , Baltimore , Newark and Los Angeles .

In Jon Corzine ’s successful race in 2000 for the U.S. Senate , people from out of state poured into New Jersey to be part of a huge get - out - the - vote operation .
Some were paid $ 75 apiece in street money , as part of the well - funded Corzine campaign ’s election day efforts .
In the 2004 presidential race , John F. Kerry ’s campaign paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in street money to Philadelphia ’s Democratic apparatus , according to city party veterans .
A famous scene played out at a Democratic committee meeting during the 1980 presidential primary .
Vice President Walter F. Mondale came to Philadelphia hoping to boost support for President Carter , then in a tough nomination fight with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy .
Mondale made his pitch , touting Carter ’s record on human rights and the economy .
Advertisement
In an interview Thursday , Mondale picked up the story from there :
“ I finished my remarks , and the first person who stood up said : ‘ Where ’s the money ? ’
And I think he was talking about street money . ”
Dryly , Mondale added : “ That was not the subject of my talk . ”
Before the 2002 state elections , a reporter watched two practitioners of the street - money arts in action : Campbell and U.S. Rep. Robert A. Brady , a ward leader and chair of Philadelphia ’s Democratic committee .
Advertisement
Brady was sitting in his campaign office with two of his political lieutenants .
He reached into a desk drawer at one point and pulled out a $ 50 bill -- street money .
Brady tore it in two and gave each man a half .
Then the men made a bet :
Whoever pulled in the most Democratic votes that day from his precincts would get both halves .
The night before that vote , Campbell , sitting at a kitchen table in a retirement community in West Philadelphia , spent hours passing out street money to various Democratic committee people .
She kept receipts , working with stacks of cash .
Campbell would give $ 10 to local teenagers assigned to put leaflets in doorways .
And she paid out $ 100 to each of the committee people in her jurisdiction .
Ward leaders say such payments defray expenses such as food and gasoline , and compensate people for a grueling election day .
It is unclear to what extent Obama may suffer at the polls if any part of the city ’s Democratic apparatus jumps to Clinton .
Advertisement
Obama ’s strategy in Pennsylvania depends on a strong turnout in the city ’s black precincts .
That way , he can cut into the advantage Clinton has among older and blue - collar voters elsewhere in the state .
Campbell said she could not in good conscience ask people to work for Obama for free .
“ I ’m not going to do that , ” said Campbell , who heads a coalition of black ward leaders .
“ There are a lot of poor people here . ”
Paulmier said that of his ward ’s 48 committee people , the vast majority supported Obama .
Though he does n’t expect a wholesale exodus to the Clinton campaign if no street money is paid , a handful of those key people might bolt , he said .
Advertisement
“ If word gets out that the Clinton campaign is going to make . . . more support available to committee people , maybe five of the 48 might defect , ” he said .
With a week and a half left before the election , political leaders hope that Obama will relent .
Garry Williams , a ward leader based in north - central Philadelphia , said that he had not heard directly that the Obama campaign was withholding money .
But he said payment would be needed .
Workers who are in the field for Obama on April 22 will put in days stretching from 12 to 16 hours , he said .
“ It ’s our tradition , ” Williams said .
“ You do n’t come to someone ’s house and change the rules of someone ’s house .
That ’s just respect . ”

Introduction
The emergence of agriculture and civilisation in the Neolithic
Explaining the origins of agriculture and civilisation
Pharmacological properties of cereals and milk
Hypothesis : exorphins and the origin of agriculture and civilisation
Discussion
Conclusion
References
The ideas in this article have since been updated in two papers , Pharmacological Influences on the Neolithic Transition and How psychoactive drugs shape human culture : A multi-disciplinary perspective .
The second is not available to the general public , but the first argues that " a significant portion of the effort of early cultivators globally was probably directed to the production of psychoactive substances , including the use of cereals , poppies , coca , sugar cane , tobacco , and cannabis , " and that " a major component of the Neolithic transition was a pharmacological transition " using psychoactive substances .
What might head a list of the defining characteristics of the human species ?
While our view of ourselves could hardly avoid highlighting our accomplishments in engineering , art , medicine , space travel and the like , in a more dispassionate assessment agriculture would probably displace all other contenders for top billing .
Most of the other achievements of humankind have followed from this one .
Almost without exception , all people on earth today are sustained by agriculture .
With a minute number of exceptions , no other species is a farmer .
Essentially all of the arable land in the world is under cultivation .
Yet agriculture began just a few thousand years ago , long after the appearance of anatomically modern humans .
Given the rate and the scope of this revolution in human biology , it is quite extraordinary that there is no generally accepted model accounting for the origin of agriculture .
Indeed , an increasing array of arguments over recent years has suggested that agriculture , far from being a natural and upward step , in fact led commonly to a lower quality of life .
Hunter - gatherers typically do less work for the same amount of food , are healthier , and are less prone to famine than primitive farmers ( Lee & DeVore 1968 , Cohen 1977 , 1989 ) .
A biological assessment of what has been called the puzzle of agriculture might phrase it in simple ethological terms : why was this behaviour ( agriculture ) reinforced ( and hence selected for ) if it was not offering adaptive rewards surpassing those accruing to hunter - gathering or foraging economies ?
This paradox is responsible for a profusion of models of the origin of agriculture .
' Few topics in prehistory ' , noted Hayden ( 1990 ) ' have engendered as much discussion and resulted in so few satisfying answers as the attempt to explain why hunter / gatherers began to cultivate plants and raise animals .
Climatic change , population pressure , sedentism , resource concentration from desertification , girls ' hormones , land ownership , geniuses , rituals , scheduling conflicts , random genetic kicks , natural selection , broad spectrum adaptation and multicausal retreats from explanation have all been proffered to explain domestication .
All have major flaws ... the data do not accord well with any one of these models .
' Recent discoveries of potentially psychoactive substances in certain agricultural products -- cereals and milk -- suggest an additional perspective on the adoption of agriculture and the behavioural changes ( ' civilisation ' ) that followed it .
In this paper we review the evidence for the drug - like properties of these foods , and then show how they can help to solve the biological puzzle just described .
From about 10,000 years ago , groups of people in several areas around the world began to abandon the foraging lifestyle that had been successful , universal and largely unchanged for millennia ( Lee & DeVore 1968 ) .
They began to gather , then cultivate and settle around , patches of cereal grasses and to domesticate animals for meat , labour , skins and other materials , and milk .
Farming , based predominantly on wheat and barley , first appeared in the Middle East , and spread quickly to western Asia , Egypt and Europe .
The earliest civilisations all relied primarily on cereal agriculture .
Cultivation of fruit trees began three thousand years later , again in the MiddleEast , and vegetables and other crops followed ( Zohari 1986 ) .
Cultivation of rice began in Asia about 7000 years ago ( Stark 1986 ) .
To this day , for most people , two - thirds of protein and calorie intake is cereal - derived .
( In the west , in the twentieth century , cereal consumption has decreased slightly in favour of meat , sugar , fats and so on . )
The respective contributions of each cereal to current total world production are : wheat ( 28 per cent ) , corn / maize ( 27 per cent ) , rice ( 25 per cent ) , barley ( 10 per cent ) , others ( 10 per cent ) ( Pedersen et al. 1989 ) .
The modern human diet is very different from that of closely related primates and , almost certainly , early hominids ( Gordon 1987 ) .
Though there is controversy over what humans ate before the development of agriculture , the diet certainly did not include cereals and milk in appreciable quantities .
The storage pits and processing tools necessary for significant consumption of cereals did not appear until the Neolithic ( Washburn & Lancaster 1968 ) .
Dairy products were not available in quantity before the domestication of animals .
The early hominid diet ( from about four million years ago ) , evolving as it did from that of primate ancestors , consisted primarily of fruits , nuts and other vegetable matter , and some meat -- items that could be foraged for and eaten with little or no processing .
Comparisons of primate and fossil - hominid anatomy , and of the types and distribution of plants eaten raw by modern chimpanzees , baboons and humans ( Peters & O' Brien 1981 , Kay 1985 ) , as well as microscope analysis of wear patterns on fossil teeth ( Walker 1981 , Peuch et al.1983 ) suggest that australopithecines were ' mainly frugivorous omnivores with a dietary pattern similar to that of modern chimpanzees ' ( Susman 1987:171 ) .
The diet of pre-agricultural but anatomically modern humans ( from 30,000 years ago ) diversified somewhat , but still consisted of meat , fruits , nuts , legumes , edible roots and tubers , with consumption of cereal seeds only increasing towards the end of the Pleistocene ( e.g. Constantini 1989 and subsequent chapters in Harris and Hillman 1989 ) .
Within a few thousand years of the adoption of cereal agriculture , the old hunter - gatherer style of social organisation began to decline .
Large , hierarchically organised societies appeared , centred around villages and then cities .
With the rise of civilisation and the state came socioeconomic classes , job specialisation , governments and armies .
The size of populations living as coordinated units rose dramatically above pre-agricultural norms .
While hunter - gatherers lived in egalitarian , autonomous bands of about 20 closely related persons , with at most a tribal level of organisation above that , early agricultural villages had 50 to 200 inhabitants , and early cities 10,000 or more .
People 'had to learn to curb deep - rooted forces which worked for increasing conflict and violence in large groups ' ( Pfeiffer 1977:438 ) .
Agriculture and civilisation meant the end of foraging -- a subsistence method with shortterm goals and rewards -- and the beginning ( for most ) of regular arduous work , oriented to future payoffs and the demands of superiors .
' With the coming of large communities , families no longer cultivated the land for themselves and their immediate needs alone , but for strangers and for the future .
They worked all day instead of a few hours a day , as hunter - gatherers had done .
There were schedules , quotas , overseers , and punishments for slacking off ' ( Pfeiffer 1977:21 ) .
The phenomena of human agriculture and civilisation are ethologically interesting , because ( 1 ) virtually no other species lives this way , and ( 2 ) humans did not live this way until relatively recently .
Why was this way of life adopted , and why has it become dominant in the human species ?
Until recent decades , the transition to farming was seen as an inherently progressive one : people learnt that planting seeds caused crops to grow , and this new improved food source led to larger populations , sedentary farm and town life , more leisure time and so to specialisation , writing , technological advances and civilisation .
It is now clear that agriculture was adopted despite certain disadvantages of that lifestyle ( e.g. Flannery 1973 , Henry 1989 ) .
There is a substantial literature ( e.g. Reed 1977 ) , not only on how agriculture began , but why .
Palaeopathological and comparative studies show that health deteriorated in populations that adopted cereal agriculture , returning to pre-agricultural levels only in modem times .
This is in part attributable to the spread of infection in crowded cities , but is largely due to a decline in dietary quality that accompanied intensive cereal farming ( Cohen 1989 ) .
People in many parts of the world remained hunter - gatherers until quite recently ; though they were quite aware of the existence and methods of agriculture , they declined to undertake it ( Lee & DeVore 1968 , Harris 1977 ) .
Cohen ( 1977:141 ) summarised the problem by asking : ' If agriculture provides neither better diet , nor greater dietary reliability , nor greater ease , but conversely appears to provide a poorer diet , less reliably , with greater labor costs , why does anyone become a farmer ?' Many explanations have been offered , usually centred around a particular factor that forced the adoption of agriculture , such as environmental or population pressure ( for reviews see Rindos 1984 , Pryor 1986 , Redding 1988 , Blumler & Byrne 1991 ) .
Each of these models has been criticised extensively , and there is at this time no generally accepted explanation of the origin of agriculture .
A similar problem is posed by the post - agricultural appearance , all over the world , of cities and states , and again there is a large literature devoted to explaining it ( e.g. Claessen & Skalnik 1978 ) .
The major behavioural changes made in adopting the civilised lifestyle beg explanation .
Bledsoe ( 1987:136 ) summarised the situation thus :
' There has never been and there is not now agreement on the nature and significance of the rise of civilisation .
The questions posed by the problem are simple , yet fundamental .
How did civilisation come about ?
What animus impelled man to forego the independence , intimacies , and invariability of tribal existence for the much larger and more impersonal political complexity we call the state ?
What forces fused to initiate the mutation that slowly transformed nomadic societies into populous cities with ethnic mixtures , stratified societies , diversified economies and unique cultural forms ?
Was the advent of civilisation the inevitable result of social evolution and natural laws of progress or was man the designer of his own destiny ?
Have technological innovations been the motivating force or was it some intangible factor such as religion or intellectual advancement ?
' To a very good approximation , every civilisation that came into being had cereal agriculture as its subsistence base , and wherever cereals were cultivated , civilisation appeared .
Some hypotheses have linked the two .
For example , Wittfogel 's ( 1957 ) ' hydraulic theory ' postulated that irrigation was needed for agriculture , and the state was in turn needed to organise irrigation .
But not all civilisations used irrigation , and other possible factors ( e.g. river valley placement , warfare , trade , technology , religion , and ecological and population pressure ) have not led to a universally accepted model .
Recent research into the pharmacology of food presents a new perspective on these problems .
Prompted by a possible link between diet and mental illness , several researchers in the late 1970s began investigating the occurrence of drug - like substances in some common foodstuffs .
Dohan ( 1966 , 1984 ) and Dohan et al. ( 1973 , 1983 ) found that symptoms of schizophrenia were relieved somewhat when patients were fed a diet free of cereals and milk .
He also found that people with coeliac disease -- those who are unable to eat wheat gluten because of higher than normal permeability of the gut -- were statistically likely to suffer also from schizophrenia .
Research in some Pacific communities showed that schizophrenia became prevalent in these populations only after they became ' partially westernised and consumed wheat , barley beer , and rice ' ( Dohan 1984 ) .
Groups led by Zioudrou ( 1979 ) and Brantl ( 1979 ) found opioid activity in wheat , maize and barley ( exorphins ) , and bovine and human milk ( casomorphin ) , as well as stimulatory activity in these proteins , and in oats , rye and soy .
Cereal exorphin is much stronger than bovine casomorphin , which in turn is stronger than human casomorphin .
Mycroft et al. ( 1982 , 1987 ) found an analogue of MIF - 1 , a naturally occurring dopaminergic peptide , in wheat and milk .
It occurs in no other exogenous protein .
( In subsequent sections we use the term exorphin to cover exorphins , casomorphin , and the MIF - 1 analogue .
Though opioid and dopaminergic substances work in different ways , they are both ' rewarding ' , and thus more or less equivalent for our purposes . )
Since then , researchers have measured the potency of exorphins , showing them to be comparable to morphine and enkephalin ( Heubner et al. 1984 ) , determined their amino acid sequences ( Fukudome & Yoshikawa 1992 ) , and shown that they are absorbed from the intestine ( Svedburg et al.1985 ) and can produce effects such as analgesia and reduction of anxiety which are usually associated with poppy - derived opioids ( Greksch et al.1981 , Panksepp et al.1984 ) .
Mycroft et al. estimated that 150 mg of the MIF - 1 analogue could be produced by normal daily intake of cereals and milk , noting that such quantities are orally active , and half this amount ' has induced mood alterations in clinically depressed subjects ' ( Mycroft et al. 1982:895 ) .
( For detailed reviews see Gardner 1985 and Paroli 1988 . )
Most common drugs of addiction are either opioid ( e.g heroin and morphine ) or dopaminergic ( e.g. cocaine and amphetamine ) , and work by activating reward centres in the brain .
Hence we may ask , do these findings mean that cereals and milk are chemically rewarding ?
Are humans somehow ' addicted ' to these foods ?
Discussion of the possible behavioural effects of exorphins , in normal dietary amounts , has been cautious .
Interpretations of their significance have been of two types : where a pathological effect is proposed ( usually by cereal researchers , and related to Dohan 's findings , though see also Ramabadran & Bansinath 1988 ) , andwhere a natural function is proposed ( by milk researchers , who suggest that casomorphin may help in mother - infant bonding or otherwise regulate infant development ) .
We believe that there can be no natural function for ingestion of exorphins by adult humans .
It may be that a desire to find a natural function has impeded interpretation ( as well as causing attention to focus on milk , where a natural function is more plausible ) .
It is unlikely that humans are adapted to a large intake of cereal exorphin , because the modern dominance of cereals in the diet is simply too new .
If exorphin is found in cow 's milk , then it may have a natural function for cows ; similarly , exorphins in human milk may have a function for infants .
But whether this is so or not , adult humans do not naturally drink milk of any kind , so any natural function could not apply to them .
Our sympathies therefore lie with the pathological interpretation of exorphins , whereby substances found in cereals and milk are seen as modern dietary abnormalities which may cause schizophrenia , coeliac disease or whatever .
But these are serious diseases found in a minority .
Can exorphins be having an effect on humankind at large ?
Research into food allergy has shown that normal quantities of some foods can have pharmacological , including behavioural , effects .
Many people develop intolerances to particular foods .
Various foods are implicated , and a variety of symptoms is produced .
( The term ' intolerance ' rather than allergy is often used , as in many cases the immune system may not be involved ( Egger 1988:159 ) .
Some intolerance symptoms , such as anxiety , depression , epilepsy , hyperactivity , and schizophrenic episodes involve brain function ( Egger 1988 , Scadding & Brostoff 1988 ) .
Radcliffe ( 1982 , quoted in 1987:808 ) listed the foods at fault , in descending order of frequency , in a trial involving 50 people : wheat ( more than 70 per cent of subjects reacted in some way to it ) , milk ( 60 per cent ) , egg ( 35 per cent ) , corn , cheese , potato , coffee , rice , yeast , chocolate , tea , citrus , oats , pork , plaice , cane , and beef ( 10 per cent ) .
This is virtually a list of foods that have become common in the diet following the adoption of agriculture , in order of prevalence .
The symptoms most commonly alleviated by treatment were mood change ( > 50 per cent ) followed by headache , musculoskeletal and respiratory ailments .
One of the most striking phenomena in these studies is that patients often exhibit cravings , addiction and withdrawal symptoms with regard to these foods ( Egger 1988:170 , citing Randolph 1978 ; see also Radcliffe 1987:808-10 , 814 , Kroker 1987:856 , 864 , Sprague & Milam 1987:949 , 953 , Wraith 1987:489 , 491 ) .
Brostoff and Gamlin ( 1989:103 ) estimated that 50 per cent of intolerance patients crave the foods that cause them problems , and experience withdrawal symptoms when excluding those foods from their diet .
Withdrawal symptoms are similar to those associated with drug addictions ( Radcliffe 1987:808 ) .
The possibility that exorphins are involved has been noted ( Bell 1987:715 ) , and Brostoff and Gamlin conclude ( 1989:230 ) : '... the results so far suggest that they might influence our mood .
There is certainly no question of anyone getting ' high ' on a glass of milk or a slice of bread - the amounts involved are too small for that - but these foods might induce a sense of comfort and wellbeing , as food - intolerant patients often say they do .
There are also other hormone - like peptides in partial digests of food , which might have other effects on the body .
' There is no possibility that craving these foods has anything to do with the popular notion of the body telling the brain what it needs for nutritional purposes .
These foods were not significant in the human diet before agriculture , and large quantities of them can not be necessary for nutrition .
In fact , the standard way to treat food intolerance is to remove the offending items from the patient 's diet .
But what are the effects of these foods on normal people ?
Though exorphins cannot have a naturally selected physiological function in humans , this does not mean that they have no effect .
Food intolerance research suggests that cereals and milk , in normal dietary quantities , are capable of affecting behaviour in many people .
And if severe behavioural effects in schizophrenics and coeliacs can be caused by higher than normal absorption of peptides , then more subtle effects , which may not even be regarded as abnormal , could be produced in people generally .
The evidence presented so far suggests the following interpretation .
The ingestion of cereals and milk , in normal modern dietary amounts by normal humans , activates reward centres in the brain .
Foods that were common in the diet before agriculture ( fruits and so on ) do not have this pharmacological property .
The effects of exorphins are qualitatively the same as those produced by other opioid and / or dopaminergic drugs , that is , reward , motivation , reduction of anxiety , a sense of wellbeing , and perhaps even addiction .
Though the effects of a typical meal are quantitatively less than those of doses of those drugs , most modern humans experience them several times a day , every day of their adult lives .
When this scenario of human dietary practices is viewed in the light of the problem of the origin of agriculture described earlier , it suggests an hypothesis that combines the results of these lines of enquiry .
Exorphin researchers , perhaps lacking a long - term historical perspective , have generally not investigated the possibility that these foods really are drug - like , and have instead searched without success for exorphin 's natural function .
The adoption of cereal agriculture and the subsequent rise of civilisation have not been satisfactorily explained , because the behavioural changes underlying them have no obvious adaptive basis .
These unsolved and until - now unrelated problems may in fact solve each other .
The answer , we suggest , is this : cereals and dairy foods are not natural human foods , but rather are preferred because they contain exorphins .
This chemical reward was the incentive for the adoption of cereal agriculture in the Neolithic .
Regular self - administration of these substances facilitated the behavioural changes that led to the subsequent appearance of civilisation .
This is the sequence of events that we envisage .
Climatic change at the end of the last glacial period led to an increase in the size and concentration of patches of wild cereals in certain areas ( Wright 1977 ) .
The large quantities of cereals newly available provided an incentive to try to make a meal of them .
People who succeeded in eating sizeable amounts of cereal seeds discovered the rewarding properties of the exorphins contained in them .
Processing methods such as grinding and cooking were developed to make cereals more edible .
The more palatable they could be made , the more they were consumed , and the more important the exorphin reward became for more people .
At first , patches of wild cereals were protected and harvested .
Later , land was cleared and seeds were planted and tended , to increase quantity and reliability of supply .
Exorphins attracted people to settle around cereal patches , abandoning their nomadic lifestyle , and allowed them to display tolerance instead of aggression as population densities rose in these new conditions .
Though it was , we suggest , the presence of exorphins that caused cereals ( and not an alternative already prevalent in the diet ) to be the major early cultigens , this does not mean that cereals are ' just drugs ' .
They have been staples for thousands of years , and clearly have nutritional value .
However , treating cereals as ' just food ' leads to difficulties in explaining why anyone bothered to cultivate them .
The fact that overall health declined when they were incorporated into the diet suggests that their rapid , almost total replacement of other foods was due more to chemical reward than to nutritional reasons .
It is noteworthy that the extent to which early groups became civilised correlates with the type of agriculture they practised .
That is , major civilisations ( in south - west Asia , Europe , India , and east and parts of South - East Asia ; central and parts of north and south America ; Egypt , Ethiopia and parts of tropical and west Africa ) stemmed from groups which practised cereal , particularly wheat , agriculture ( Bender 1975:12 , Adams 1987:201 , Thatcher 1987:212 ) .
( The rarer nomadic civilisations were based on dairy farming . )
Groups which practised vegeculture ( of fruits , tubers etc. ) , or no agriculture ( in tropical and south Africa , north and central Asia , Australia , New Guinea and the Pacific , and much of north and south America ) did not become civilised to the same extent .
Thus major civilisations have in common that their populations were frequent ingesters of exorphins .
We propose that large , hierarchical states were a natural consequence among such populations .
Civilisation arose because reliable , on - demand availability of dietary opioids to individuals changed their behaviour , reducing aggression , and allowed them to become tolerant of sedentary life in crowded groups , to perform regular work , and to be more easily subjugated by rulers .
Two socioeconomic classes emerged where before there had been only one ( Johnson & Earle 1987:270 ) , thus establishing a pattern which has been prevalent since that time .
Some nutritionists deny the notion of a pre-agricultural natural human diet on the basis that humans are omnivorous , or have adapted to agricultural foods ( e.g. Garn & Leonard 1989 ; for the contrary view see for example Eaton & Konner 1985 ) .
An omnivore , however , is simply an animal that eats both meat and plants : it can still be quite specialised in its preferences ( chimpanzees are an appropriate example ) .
A degree of omnivory in early humans might have preadapted them to some of the nutrients contained in cereals , but not to exorphins , which are unique to cereals .
The differential rates of lactase deficiency , coeliac disease and favism ( the inability to metabolise fava beans ) among modern racial groups are usually explained as the result of varying genetic adaptation to post - agricultural diets ( Simopoulos 1990 : 27 - 9 ) , and this could be thought of as implying some adaptation to exorphins as well .
We argue that little or no such adaptation has occurred , for two reasons : first , allergy research indicates that these foods still cause abnormal reactions in many people , and that susceptibility is variable within as well as between populations , indicating that differential adaptation is not the only factor involved .
Second , the function of the adaptations mentioned is to enable humans to digest those foods , and if they are adaptations , they arose because they conferred a survival advantage .
But would susceptibility to the rewarding effects of exorphins lead to lower , or higher , reproductive success ?
One would expect in general that an animal with a supply of drugs would behave less adaptively and so lower its chances of survival .
But our model shows how the widespread exorphin ingestion in humans has led to increased population .
And once civilisation was the norm , non-susceptibility to exorphins would have meant not fitting in with society .
Thus , though there may be adaptation to the nutritional content of cereals , there will be little or none to exorphins .
In any case , while contemporary humans may enjoy the benefits of some adaptation to agricultural diets , those who actually made the change ten thousand years ago did not .
We are not the first to suggest a non-nutritional motive for early agriculture .
Hayden ( 1990 ) argued that early cultigens and trade items had more prestige value than utility , and suggested that agriculture began because the powerful used its products for competitive feasting and accrual of wealth .
Braidwood et al. ( 1953 ) and later Katz and Voigt ( 1986 ) suggested that the incentive for cereal cultivation was the production of alcoholic beer : ' Under what conditions would the consumption of a wild plant resource be sufficiently important to lead to a change in behaviour ( experiments with cultivation ) in order to ensure an adequate supply of this resource ?
If wild cereals were in fact a minor part of the diet , any argument based on caloric need is weakened .
It is our contention that the desire for alcohol would constitute a perceived psychological and social need that might easily prompt changes in subsistence behaviour ' ( Katz & Voigt 1986:33 ) .
This view is clearly compatible with ours .
However there may be problems with an alcohol hypothesis : beer may have appeared after bread and other cereal products , and been consumed less widely or less frequently ( Braidwood et al. 1953 ) .
Unlike alcohol , exorphins are present in all these products .
This makes the case for chemical reward as the motive for agriculture much stronger .
Opium poppies , too , were an early cultigen ( Zohari 1986 ) .
Exorphin , alcohol , and opium are primarily rewarding ( as opposed to the typically hallucinogenic drugs used by some hunter - gatherers ) and it is the artificial reward which is necessary , we claim , for civilisation .
Perhaps all three were instrumental in causing civilised behaviour to emerge .
Cereals have important qualities that differentiate them from most other drugs .
They are a food source as well as a drug , and can be stored and transported easily .
They are ingested in frequent small doses ( not occasional large ones ) , and do not impede work performance in most people .
A desire for the drug , even cravings or withdrawal , can be confused with hunger .
These features make cereals the ideal facilitator of civilisation ( and may also have contributed to the long delay in recognising their pharmacological properties ) .
Our hypothesis is not a refutation of existing accounts of the origins of agriculture , but rather fits alongside them , explaining why cereal agriculture was adopted despite its apparent disadvantages and how it led to civilisation .
Gaps in our knowledge of exorphins limit the generality and strength of our claims .
We do not know whether rice , millet and sorghum , nor grass species which were harvested by African and Australian hunter - gatherers , contain exorphins .
We need to be sure that preagricultural staples do not contain exorphins in amounts similar to those in cereals .
We do not know whether domestication has affected exorphin content or - potency .
A test of our hypothesis by correlation of diet and degree of civilisation in different populations will require quantitative knowledge of the behavioural effects of all these foods .
We do not comment on the origin of noncereal agriculture , nor why some groups used a combination of foraging and farming , reverted from farming to foraging , or did not farm at all .
Cereal agriculture and civilisation have , during the past ten thousand years , become virtually universal .
The question , then , is not why they happened here and not there , but why they took longer to become established in some places than in others .
At all times and places , chemical reward and the influence of civilisations already using cereals weighed in favour of adopting this lifestyle , the disadvantages of agriculture weighed against it , and factors such as climate , geography , soil quality , and availability of cultigens influenced the outcome .
There is a recent trend to multi-causal models of the origins of agriculture ( e.g. Redding 1988 , Henry 1989 ) , and exorphins can be thought of as simply another factor in the list .
Analysis of the relative importance of all the factors involved , at all times and places , is beyond the scope of this paper .
' An animal is a survival machine for the genes that built it .
We too are animals , and we too are survival machines for our genes .
That is the theory .
In practice it makes a lot of sense when we look at wild animals ....
It is very different when we look at ourselves .
We appear to be a serious exception to the Darwinian law ....
It obviously just is n't true that most of us spend our time working energetically for the preservation of our genes ' ( Dawkins 1989:138 ) .
Many ethologists have acknowledged difficulties in explaining civilised human behaviour on evolutionary grounds , in some cases suggesting that modern humans do not always behave adaptively .
Yet since agriculture began , the human population has risen by a factor of 1000 : Irons ( 1990 ) notes that ' population growth is not the expected effect of maladaptive behaviour ' .
We have reviewed evidence from several areas of research which shows that cereals and dairy foods have drug - like properties , and shown how these properties may have been the incentive for the initial adoption of agriculture .
We suggested further that constant exorphin intake facilitated the behavioural changes and subsequent population growth of civilisation , by increasing people 's tolerance of ( a ) living in crowded sedentary conditions , ( b ) devoting effort to the benefit of non-kin , and ( c ) playing a subservient role in a vast hierarchical social structure .
Cereals are still staples , and methods of artificial reward have diversified since that time , including today a wide range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological cultural artifacts whose function , ethologically speaking , is to provide reward without adaptive benefit .
It seems reasonable then to suggest that civilisation not only arose out of self - administration of artificial reward , but is maintained in this way among contemporary humans .
Hence a step towards resolution of the problem of explaining civilised human behaviour may be to incorporate into ethological models this widespread distortion of behaviour by artificial reward .

What a pleasure a coffee house daily bestows !
To read and hear how the World merrily goes .
The Coffee House , James Miller
What do Lloyd's of London , Johann Sebastian Bach , The Rape of the Lock , the cogers society , The French Revolution , Sir Isaac Newton , the world 's oldest newspaper , and the Internet have in common ?
They are all linked to the seventeenth and eighteenth century coffee house , a peculiar institution that proved an underlying factor in the transition of Western Europe toward modern concepts of literature , art , economics , and government .
The focus of both deathly serious discussion and relentless mocking , coffee houses fostered a blossoming of interest and discussion oddly reminiscent of the modern World Wide Web , their best historical parallel .
Coffee was a jealously guarded secret of the Arab world , developed as an alternative to ( nominally ) forbidden alcohol .
First introduced to the Middle East from Ethiopia via Yemen and eventually arriving in Turkey , it was traded into Europe during the mid-seventeenth century , but not embraced .
Because of its origins in Muslim lands , many members of the clergy and government in the first European nations it reached wanted the drink banned as heretical .
Pope Clement VIII saved coffee from the obscurity of an illegal substance .
Upon tasting a cup of the brew , he declared , " This Satan 's drink is so delicious that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it .
We shall cheat Satan by baptizing it . "
With the blessing of the Holy See , coffee spread throughly through Western Europe and took a foothold in the emerging urban cultures of the seventeenth century .
While initially considered a medicinal drink , the stimulating effects of coffee and its perceived improvement of intellectual acuity made it attractive as a social drink .
In comparison to beverages such as beer and wine , coffee was vastly preferable for efficient business , possessing no particularly ill effects save for slightly jumpy nerves .
For an emerging middle class increasingly dependent upon the mind instead of the body to accomplish a day 's labor , coffee was perfectly suited in both novelty and contrast to lower - class alcohol to become a sensation .
England 's first coffee house was established in Oxford in 1650 , however it was " Pasque Rose , " established in London in 1652 , that truly started the craze for coffee .
A Greek proprietor receiving coffee shipments from a friend travelling in Turkey opened his establishment to the public , drawing the urban elite .
Taverns decried the competition as first a satanic brewery , then a fire hazard , then a poisoner , but to no avail .
By 1663 , there were 82 coffee houses in London proper alone .
By the turn of the century , 500 .
Coffee houses offered a civilized counterpart to the prodigious taverns of the lower classes .
They were decorated with comfy furniture , gilt decorations , and bookshelves filled with eminent works of literature ; a far cry from the rowdy atmosphere of the pub .
Such practices as toasts to health were banned , and hostile quarrelers paid the penalty of having to buy all patrons an order of coffee , thus laying down a precedent for sober , cleanly , and friendly establishments .
But , importantly , coffee houses charged very little for admission , and nothing for information .
This became their greatest strength .
While this distinction of civilization drawing the line between the middle / upper classes and the lower classes was an attraction , it was not the true source of the exploding growth of coffee .
Across Europe , a new passion for Science and Reason was seizing the hearts and minds of the young generation .
It was time to establish a new order for the world , and the coffee house became the forum for this message .
Coffee fuelled a sudden and spectacular information exchange .
Location led to specialization , and certain kinds of clientele grew to be associated with each establishment .
Much like internet discussion boards , one began to define oneself intellectually by the coffee houses one frequented .
They were the " Penny Universities , " allowing for any education for only the penny price of admission .
And the varieties of subjects were spectacular :
All accounts of Gallantry , Pleasure , and Entertainment shall be under the Article of White 's Chocolate - house ; Poetry , under that of Will 's Coffee - house ; Learning under ...
Grecian ; Foreign and Domestick News , you will have from St James 's Coffee House
So well known were many coffee houses ' associations that the , a London newspaper founded in 1709 , organized its articles under coffee house subject headings :
Coffee houses were great producers of paper , with broadsides , pamphlets , handwritten scrawls , books , and newspapers distributed generously and dispersed through the whole network of coffee establishments .
This phenomenon was of even greater importance outside of the relatively free political climate of England .
Faced with fierce censorship by the governments of Austria and France , coffee patrons in those countries distributed illicit political and literary tracts by means of the coffee house , circumventing print regulations .
From one of these regular broadsheets , " Wienerische Diarium , " was founded the , considered to be the world 's oldest continually published newspaper .
As may be expected , the political frankness of the coffee houses led to their wary regard by the powerful of Western Europe .
Many , such as King Charles II , attempted to ban the establishments all together .
In his 1675 proclamation , he declared that coffeehouses had
very evil and dangerous effects ... for that in such Houses ... divers False , Malitious and Scandalous Reports are devised and spread abroad , to the Defamation of His Majestie 's Government , and to the Disturbance of the Peace and Quiet of the Realm .
Faced with widespread disregard for his decree , the government settled for six month licenses of £ 500 mandatory for every establishment .
This too ignored , a vague demand that coffee houses refuse entry to spies and mischief makers had to suffice
In Paris , the government took a more active role in suppressing the simmering discontent coursing through the coffee house scene .
All of the establishments were infested with spies , and many Parisians were suddenly dragged away to the Bastille for a comment made in the coffee house .
Hundreds of pages of reports detail coffee house conversations collected by a vast network of royal watchers .
Despite this effort , nothing could stop the gathering tempest of the revolution .
Two days before the storming of the Bastille , Camille Desmoulins roused his country , standing atop a coffee house table , two pistols brandished , with his historic appeal " Aux armes , citoyens ! "
With the coming of the East India Company and a massive influx of tea , the coffee house declined in England .
Most establishments turned to serving tea , though still called coffee houses , but the intellectual burst was over as the empire made a transition toward obsession with colonialism .
In other regions of Europe , however , the coffee house continued strongly .
In Vienna , coffee houses were intimately associated with the musical establishment , playing host to many modern , renowned Classical composers .
Viewed by many as a vice , coffee was an addiction for the Viennese , both men and women .
Johan Sebastian Bach immortalized the Viennese coffee house among his secular cantatas with " Schweigt Stille , Plaudert Nicht , " or , the Coffee Cantata .
Telling the tale of petulant daughter and caffeine - addict Lieschen and her exasperated father Schlendrian , it was first performed in a coffee house .
The effect of the coffee house on the middle class intellectuals , business men , and artists of the seventeenth and eighteenth century can be best understood , oddly , by a parallel with the Internet .
Like the Internet , coffee houses sprang from obscurity to a major cultural phenomenon .
They provided an open environment for discussion on a wide variety of topics with diverse participants .
They supplied the opportunity for insightful peer review of writing , fostered lightning - speed gossip and rumor , gave rise to new business models ( many fanciful failures , but many wildly successful ) , and allowed amateurs to take control of the press and engage in their own journalism .
They were free , sometimes contentious media , looked upon with some disdain and wariness by government officials frightened by obscenity or sedition .
While access required payment , information was free .
In an ironic twist of history 's hidden hand , coffee houses and the Internet have now joined with the introduction of WiFi hotspots for wireless connection .
The coffee house , an Arab introduction , revolutionized information exchange throughout Western Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .
The effects of the coffee houses are still felt in modern times , from prestigious businesses to economic innovations to musical works to literature .
The black brew energized the intellectual spirit of Western Europe .
The original , insightful comparison of 17th and 18th century coffeehouses with the modern Internet belongs to the writer of the article " The Internet in a Cup " for The Economist 's December 20th , 2003 issue .
Because all writers for The Economist remain anonymous , I cannot specifically cite him or her by name .
I built upon the analysis with historic research and interpretation .
' Sick ' Secret Service emails prompt Jesse Jackson to demand files David Edwards
Published : Wednesday May 14 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Emails containing crude , racist and pornographic images " were just released by the Secret Service as part of a long - running civil rights suit filed by African American agents , " CBS 2 in Chicago reports .
One of the emails joked about civil rights leader Jesse Jackson being killed by a missile .
" The Secret Service e-mail , WBBM - TV obtained from a court filing in Washington , was titled ' The Righteous Reverend , ' and jokes about the deaths of Jackson and his wife when a missile strikes their plane , " the station reports .
" The e-mail ends with , it ' certainly would n't be a great loss and probably would n't be an accident either . ' "
The report continues , " The one about the Rev. Jackson has now led to a demand for the release of any other insulting references to members of the Jackson family in Secret Service files .
More damaging , though , is who sent and received them : top brass , including the former Special Agent in Charge of the Presidential Protective Detail , as well as the Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago field office . "
In response Jackson said , according to WBBM - TV , that he " wants all Secret Service communications which mention him , all the way back to the 1980's . "
U.S. Rep Jesse Jackson Jr. ( D - Ill . ) added , " Well , he was n't quite as charged as Mrs. Jackson was .
My mother wants to know what she has to do with this at all .
But suffice it to say that if supervisors at the Untied States Secret Service are passing around racially explicit e-mails and sexually explicit e-mails , there 's a problem at the highest ranks of the Unites States Secret Service that deserves all of our attention .
The article continues , " He said he would use his position in Congress to investigate , and has also filed Freedom of Information Act requests for Secret Service documents . "
Reacting to the story at the conservative Free Republic site , one user wrote , " Who cares what Jackson wants ?
Tell him to go back to the ghetto . "
No one else in the thread had any reaction to the comment .
CBS 2 has more details here .

Erlang is a functional language with strong support for concurrency and distribution .
It is quite trivial to start Erlang on multiple hosts and connect them .
However , you have to write custom scripts to start these nodes .
For example , on a set of local machines , ssh with public / private keys can be used to start cluster of nodes .
If you do n’t have the computing environment , you can lease your servers using Amazon ’s EC2 webservice .
In this blog , I am going to show how to start Erlang nodes on the instances of EC2 .
I have broken the instructions into two parts , setting up the EC2 instances and starting the Erlang cluster .
Setting up EC2
Get an Account
If you do n’t have S3 and EC2 account , you can get account for Amazon Simple Storage Service
and account for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud .
Create X.509 certificate
Select the “ AWS Access Key Identifiers under “ Your Web Services Account ” and follow the “ Create New ” button in this section to create a new X.509 certificate .
Also , save them locally .
Download EC2 Toolkit
Download the Command Line Tools .
Setup Environment Variables
export EC2_HOME = export PATH=$PATH :$EC2_HOME /bin export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=$EC2_HOME/pk-AR7Z7HJUXAIIHL6CR43HD4PGN75KEJNV.pem
export EC2_CERT=$EC2_HOME/cert-AR7Z7HJUXAIIHL6CR43HD4PGN75KEJNV.pem
Finding a Suitable AMI
Use following command to view default images :
ec2 - describe - images -o self -o amazon
Look for the line containing the public image identified by the ec2 - public - images / getting - started.manifest.xml value in the third column .
You can also use an image that I created , which includes Erlang distribution with an id of “ ami-23c92c4a ” .
Generating a Keypair
Use following command to create a keypair :
ec2 - add - keypair gsg-keypair
create a file named id_rsa-gsg - keypair and paste everything between ( and including ) the “ — –BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY — – ” and “ — –END RSA PRIVATE KEY — – ” lines into it .
Running an Instance
Use following command to start EC2 instance :
ec2-run- instances ami-23c92c4a -k gsg-keypair
and you may see something like :
RESERVATION r-d8fd14b1 275961154068 default INSTANCE i-1246b27b ami-23c92c4a pending gsg-keypair 0 m1.small 2007-12-04T17:34:10+0000
Check status
ec2 - describe - instances i-1246b27b
Authorizing Network Access to Your Instances
You can open certain ports you need using
ec2 - authorize default -p 22 ec2- authorize default -p 80 ec2 - authorize default -p 4369
Connecting to your Instance
ssh -i id_rsa-gsg - keypair root@ec2-72-44-51-166.z-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
open browser to http://ec2-72-44-51-166.z-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com/
Creating an Image
Modifying an Existing Image
sed - i -e 's /Congratulations !/Congratulations Shahzad Bhatti/'
/var/www/html/index.html ls -l /var/www/html/index.html
Preparing for Bundling
Copy your private key and certificate to the machine being bundled .
cd $ EC2_HOME scp -i id_rsa-gsg - keypair pk-AR7Z7HJUXAIIHL6CR43HD4PGN75KEJNV.pem cert-AR7Z7HJUXAIIHL6CR43HD4PGN75KEJNV.pem root@ec2-72-44-51-166.z-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com :/mnt
ec2 - bundle-vol -d / mnt -k /mnt/pk-AR7Z7HJUXAIIHL6CR43HD4PGN75KEJNV.pem
-c /mnt/cert-AR7Z7HJUXAIIHL6CR43HD4PGN75KEJNV.pem -u your - id -s 1536
Bundling
ec2 -upload - bundle -b ec2 - bucket -m /mnt/image.manifest.xml - a key -s password
Registering the AMI
cd /home / shahbhat/ec2-api-tools-1.2-13740 ec2-register ec2-bucket/image.manifest.xml
Deregistering Your AMI
ec2 - deregister ami-47c0252e
Removing Your AMI from Amazon S3
ec2 - delete - bundle - b - p image -a -s
Terminating Your Instances
ec2 - terminate - instances i-b15bb0d8
/sbin/ shutdown -h now
Setting up Erlang Cluster
Here is the fun and easy part :
Starting instances
I am going to start three instances from my Erlang image by opening three different shells and typing following commands :
ssh -i id_rsa-gsg - keypair root@ec2-67-202-33-171.compute-1.amazonaws.com erl - sname master - setcookie ABC Eshell V5.5 ( abort with ^G ) ( master@domU-12-31-38-00-6C - 81 ) 1 > ssh - i id_rsa-gsg - keypair root@ec2-67-202-33-171.compute-1.amazonaws.com erl - sname slave1 - setcookie ABC Eshell V5.5 ( abort with ^G ) ( slave1@domU-12-31-38-00-6C - 81 ) 1 > ssh - i id_rsa-gsg - keypair root@ec2-67-202-20-199.compute-1.amazonaws.com erl - sname slave2 - setcookie ABC Eshell V5.5 ( abort with ^G ) ( slave2@domU-12-31-38-00-40 -F6 )

Checking status of instances
Starting instances take a couple of minutes and you can check status with following command :
ec2 - describe - instances
and it showed me something like :
RESERVATION r-f7fd149e 275961154068 default INSTANCE i-0146b268 ami-23c92c4a ec2-67-202-33-171.compute-1.amazonaws.com domU-12-31-38-00-6C-81.compute-1.internal running gsg-keypair 0 m1.small 2007-12-04T17:29:39+0000 RESERVATION
r-c6fd14af 275961154068 default INSTANCE i-1046b279 ami-23c92c4a ec2-67-202-27-186.compute-1.amazonaws.com domU-12-31-38-00-35-D6.compute-1.internal running gsg-keypair 0 m1.small 2007-12-04T17:33:47+0000 RESERVATION r-d8fd14b1 275961154068 default INSTANCE i-1246b27b ami-23c92c4a ec2-67-202-20-199.compute-1.amazonaws.com domU-12-31-38-00-40-F6.compute-1.internal running gsg-keypair 0 m1.small 2007-12-04T17:34:10+0000
Connecting to the slaves from master
From the master node , I typed following commands to connect to the slave nodes :
net_adm:ping(list_to_atom(" slave1@domU-12-31-38-00-6C -81 " ) ) .
net_adm:ping(list_to_atom(" slave1@domU-12-31-38-00-6C -81 " ) ) .
and both returned pong
I then checked connected nodes with following command on the master node :
nodes ( ) .
and it returned
[ ‘slave1@domU-12-31-38-00-6C-81′ , ’slave2@domU-12-31-38-00-40-F6 ’]
I also ran the same command on slave1 and slave2 and got
nodes ( ) .
[ ‘master@domU-12-31-38-00-6C-81′ , ’slave2@domU-12-31-38-00-40-F6 ’]
( slave1@domU-12-31-38-00-6C -81 )
2 >
nodes ( ) .
[ ‘master@domU-12-31-38-00-6C-81′ , ’slave1@domU-12-31-38-00-6C-81 ’]
Testing
I then typed following simple command on the master node to test cluster :
rpc:multicall ( nodes ( ) , io , format , [ " Hello world~n " , [ ] ] ) .
and it returned : Hello world Hello world { [ ok , ok ] , [ ] }
Shutting down instances
Since , EC2 charges based on usage , you need to shutdown instances after you are done .
ec2 - describe - instances
which returned :
RESERVATION r-f7fd149e 275961154068 default INSTANCE i-0146b268 ami-23c92c4a ec2-67-202-33-171.compute-1.amazonaws.com domU-12-31-38-00-6C-81.compute-1.internal running gsg-keypair 0 m1.small 2007-12-04T17:29:39+0000 RESERVATION
r-c6fd14af 275961154068 default INSTANCE i-1046b279 ami-23c92c4a ec2-67-202-27-186.compute-1.amazonaws.com domU-12-31-38-00-35-D6.compute-1.internal running gsg-keypair 0 m1.small 2007-12-04T17:33:47+0000 RESERVATION r-d8fd14b1 275961154068 default INSTANCE i-1246b27b ami-23c92c4a ec2-67-202-20-199.compute-1.amazonaws.com domU-12-31-38-00-40-F6.compute-1.internal running gsg-keypair 0 m1.small 2007-12-04T17:34:10+0000
I then ran ec2 - terminate - instances i-0146b268 i-1046b279 i-1246b27 b
Conclusion
As you can see once you have the basic EC2 instances running , starting the Erlang cluster is pretty trivial .
“ It ’s rare to have so many scenes stacked like they are here , ” said an 18 - year - old poet living in 255 who gave his name as Eirehan Failte .
“ Even when it ’s really loud , it ’s still better than some terrible stock - trading roommate listening to Fox in the next room . ”
The place is no secret .
Some bloggers sneer at the McKibbin , calling it “ Fort Whitey . ”
Gawker , the media and gossip site , tracks the McKibbin ’s every move , calling it “ our favorite Bushwick loft space . ”
Locating it in the wrong neighborhood is no accident : people at the McKibbin also say their neighborhood seems more a part of Bushwick , which was gutted by arson in the 1977 blackout , than Williamsburg .
While Bushwick is home to a growing artists ’ scene , many pockets are still poor and the crime rate remains relatively high .
Many McKibbiners say the place offers them a way of life and an instant artistic fraternity that is all but extinct in New York , all on a quasi island that is just a stone ’s throw from the L train .
“ The community is a microcosm of artists , musicians and D.J. ’s , ” said Kevin Farrell , who is 29 and works in video production .
“ You do n’t have to leave this building , with the exception of food .
I do n’t really speak to the locals . ”

Rents vary wildly .
Two people can squeeze in to a four - by - six foot cubby in a loft , and pay $ 375 each , or a person can pay $ 530 to $ 800 to have a cubby of his or her own .
Some spaces look more like doghouses than rooms , albeit doghouses set in huge lofts .
Film screenings and jam sessions are encouraged , and television watching is frowned upon as too commercial ; these people , after all , create art .
The McKibbin is a revolving door , with each weekend bringing wide - eyed newcomers , usually in skinny jeans and chunky eyewear .
Vacancies , announced on Craigslist or spread by word of mouth , are quickly filled .
The typical tenure at the McKibbin is one year , and residents often go through distinct phases .
About the size of a locust and weighing on 7 grams , this tiny robot can jump 27 times its own size .
Looking like a gear - head grasshopper , a new robot can jump distances more than 27 times its body length .
The contraption , about the size of a locust and weighing only about a quarter of an ounce ( 7 grams ) , could aid in search and rescue operations and explore rough terrain .
Invented by researchers at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) in Switzerland , the robot can hop 10 times farther for its size and weight than any existing jumping robot .
" We are about in the same jumping performance of a locust , " said EPFL graduate student Mirko Kovac , who helped design the robot .
" The desert locust can jump up to 1 meter in distance and is around 3 centimeters long .
In order to obtain such very high jumping performance , we actually analyzed locusts and applied the same biomechanical design principles . "
The robot uses a similar mechanism to store jumping energy as fleas , locusts , grasshoppers and frogs .
It relies on a tiny battery and motor to charge two springs that can quickly release energy to achieve very powerful jumps and very quick accelerations .
After charging for 3 seconds , it can make up to 320 jumps .
" This biomimetic form of jumping is unique because it allows micro-robots to travel over many types of rough terrain where no other walking or wheeled robot could go , " said EPFL researcher Dario Floreano .
" These tiny jumping robots could be fitted with solar cells to recharge between jumps and deployed in swarms for extended exploration of remote areas on Earth or on other planets . "
Kovac unveiled the leaper at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation May 21 in Pasadena , California .
What are the Options for People with Bad Credit ?
Imagine a world where you could get a loan without ever having to worry about things like credit ratings and scores .
At first , something like that sounds pretty amazing .
After all , no - one likes having their financial history put under scrutiny every time they need to borrow money .
How much would you like to borrow ?
$ 100 $ 200 $ 300 $ 400 $ 500 $ 600 $ 700 $ 800 $ 900 $ 1000 $ 1100 $ 1200 $ 1300 $ 1400 $ 1500 $ 1600 $ 1700 $ 1800 $ 1900 $ 2000 $ 2100 $ 2200 $ 2300 $ 2400 $ 2500 $ 2600 $ 2700 $ 2800 $ 2900 $ 3000 $ 3100 $ 3200 $ 3300 $ 3400 $ 3500 $ 3600 $ 3700 $ 3800 $ 3900 $ 4000 $ 4100 $ 4200 $ 4300 $ 4400 $ 4500 $ 4600 $ 4700 $ 4800 $ 4900 $ 5000 Get Started
By submitting my information , I acknowledge I have read , understand , and agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy and the Terms & Conditions of Use .
I understand that by submitting my information , I may be contacted by telephone by one lender .
The chances are that you ’ve made a few mistakes with your cash over the years – like we all have .
Having those errors laid out in front of you and used as an excuse for a lender not to give you the money you need can be like a kick to the ribs .
This is particularly true when you ’re in a situation that has left you desperate for quick cash .
However , there ’s a purpose for credit reports , just like there ’s a reason for your loan providers asking you questions when you apply to borrow money .
Lenders throughout the world need to make sure that they ’re only giving their loan applicants the money that they can afford to pay back .
If your loan provider simply gave you the cash you asked for without checking on your financial situation first , they could be just helping you to get into more debt than you could handle .
That ’s why payday loans with no credit check simply ca n’t exist .
If you already know that you have bad credit , you ’re probably anxious about your lending situation .
That ’s what ’s started you searching for installment loans online in the first place .
After all , most of us assume that if we can just hide our bad credit history from people , we ’ll reduce our chances of being rejected from the loans that we need most .
However , although all companies are required to perform credit checks according to the rules and regulations of financial bodies , that does n’t mean you ’re out of luck .
Your credit provider might not be able to ignore your credit score entirely when you ’re applying for a payday loan .
However , these companies can choose to look at other factors besides your score when making a decision about your future .
For instance , many payday loan providers will look at whether you have a regular source of income , and if you ’ve had any significant issues with your credit or repayments in the last few months to help them make a choice about lending to you .
The best option for people with bad credit today is n’t to look for a provider that offers no credit check whatsoever .
Instead , it makes more sense to look for a payday loan provider that specializes in lending options just for you .
The Economist suggests that around 2.5 million American households take out payday loans each year , and not all of those applications are going to come from people with the best credit history .
A bad credit payday loan could be the easiest way to get the cash you need , without putting yourself or your future at risk .
Borrowing Despite Credit Issues : The Facts
Credit scores and credit histories are some of the most important things you have as an adult with a job and bills to pay .
Regardless of what you do in life , it ’s these numbers that will determine how quickly people accept you for things like mortgage applications , loans , and even new jobs .
There are plenty of employers out there that might run a credit check to see how reliable and disciplined a potential new employee might be .
When your credit plays such a significant part in your life , it ’s no wonder that people end up getting stressed when their score is n’t as good as they ’d like to be .
Some payday lenders will rush to dangerous lending options like loan sharks and expensive overdraft fines , just to reduce their risk of getting their credit reports scrutinized again .
Fortunately for most borrowers , there ’s no need to go to drastic levels to get the money you need when you ’re dealing with an emergency or sudden expense .
If you suddenly discover that you need to borrow some money for a leak in your plumbing or help making a crucial bill payment , then bad credit payday loans are a great alternative .
You do n’t even have to prove that you ’re borrowing money for an emergency to apply for a payday loan .
What ’s more , in some parts of the US , you can get extra benefits when you apply for a payday loan if you ’ve ever been involved with the military .
The Military Lending
Act ensures that there will be a cap on the kind of interest and fees that you ’ll need to pay on any credit product .
That means that you ’re safe from huge costs if you ’re an active duty service member , or the dependent of someone in the military .
How to Find Out of a Lender is Legitimate
If you decide that the best way to go forward with your financial strategy is to work with a payday loan provider , then you ’ll need to make sure that you ’re borrowing from a legitimate and respectable lender .
One way to make sure that your lender is up to scratch is to ensure that they ’re not offering “ Payday loans no credit check ” as one of their products .
If a credit provider claims that they can offer you a loan without a credit check , then they ’re going against financial regulations .
This means that the lender ca n’t be trusted to provide you with a service that wo n’t necessarily harm your future financial status or make it harder for you to make repayments in the future .
There are other ways that you can check that you ’re getting the best payday loan product too .
For instance , remember that not all states will allow payday lending in the US .
However , those that do allow for lending short - term cash advances will require lenders to be licensed .
If you ’re browsing through a payday lender ’s website and you notice no signs that they ’ve been licensed , then you could be risking trouble .
Do n’t be afraid to ask for evidence for licensing and accreditation when you ’re checking the safety of your payday loan provider .
It ’s never a good idea to expose yourself to unnecessary risks – no matter what kind of loan you ’re applying for .
Remember to double check any ratings or testimonials left by other customers on the payday loan website that you ’re using too .
This will help you to get an insight into the kind of service that you can expect .

However , it ’s always a good idea to spend some extra time building your credit rating if you can .
Whenever you have an opportunity , make sure that you ’re taking steps to improve your credit score and build your lending opportunities in the future .
The more you make sure that you ’re paying your bills off on time and enhancing your credit score , the less you ’ll need to worry about things like trying to find a lender that does n’t look at credit history when you need a loan .
New Book on Race and Economic Opportunity in America Resonates with Barack Obama Speech — “ A More Perfect Union ” A new book on race and economic opportunity , titled Segregation : The Rising Costs for America and edited by James Carr and Nandinee Kutty , was published last month by Routledge .
This book resonates remarkably with the landmark speech that Senator Barack Obama made last Tuesday ( March 18 , 2008 ) .
Below are excerpts from the Barack Obama speech juxtaposed with excerpts from chapters in the book written by Nandinee Kutty and James Carr .
The speech is in blue and the book in black print .
And if we walk away now , if we simply retreat into our respective corners , we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care , or education , or the need to find good jobs for every American .
Understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point .
As William Faulkner once wrote , " The past is n't dead and buried .
In fact , it is n't even past . "
We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country .
But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African - American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow .
“ In fact , in only a short period after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 , African Americans had achieved a measure of success in resettling their lives .
They were farming land , acquiring property , establishing trades and businesses , building or buying houses , getting educated , working jobs for wages , and raising their families .
They were on their way to acquiring economic and political power .
They had the right to vote , and they became involved in the political process , not only as voters , but also as governmental representatives at the local , state and national levels .
….. African Americans were becoming educated at a rapid rate at the end of the 19th century .
While only a small proportion of African Americans had been literate at the end of the Civil War ( state laws had forbidden literacy for the enslaved ) , by the turn of the 20th century , the majority of all African Americans were literate ( Library of Congress , 2002 ) .
But this remarkable progress was stalled and tragically reversed with a series of private actions , reinforced and institutionalized by public laws , judicial mandates , and regulatory guidelines .
Programs and practices that systematically harmed minority households and communities included the use of restrictive housing covenants that limited housing location for minorities ; a wide range of discriminatory practices by real estate professionals that further marginalized housing choice for African Americans ; lack of government redress against violence to minorities who sought to move out of their segregated communities ; biased underwriting policies of the Home Owners Loan Corporation ( HOLC ) , the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) and Veterans Administration ( VA ) that further limited minority locational choice , as well as undermined the value of properties in minority communities ; urban renewal programs that targeted the destruction of minority communities in several U.S. cities ; forced relocation of African American families to isolated , unsafe , and poorly constructed high - rise public housing projects ; and inferior treatment of minorities in the GI Bill , New Deal programs , and other public housing assistance efforts .
These policies and practices related to housing and other economic areas , as well as the general national climate in which these policies and practices thrived , explain much of the present state of disadvantage faced by millions of American families .
One of the earliest and most important blows to the civil rights of African Americans after the abolishment of slavery came in the form of the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson U.S. Supreme Court decision which upheld that states could require segregation ; and that segregation did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
This decision upheld and established the doctrine of “ separate but equal ” and viewed the segregation of races as merely a matter of social policy ; it asserted that segregation did not imply inequality .
In reality , however , segregated facilities such as public schools , parks , swimming pools and other recreation facilities , cafes and restaurants , public facilities , and seating in transportation were systematically and significantly unequal in quality ; minority - facilities were rarely if ever even close to the same level of quality .
The 1896 Plessy decision marked a significant turning point after which all levels of government passed further segregation laws and expanded segregation practices .
By 1900 , all Deep South states had passed legislation and enforced social behaviors instituting segregation and the subordination of African Americans by whites ( Jaynes , forthcoming ) .
Under these laws , which came to be known as “ Jim Crow laws , ” African Americans were denied the right to vote through poll taxes , unfair literacy tests , and physical and economic intimidation .
Their employment mobility was curtailed by anti-enticement laws that made it a crime for any employer to attempt to hire a worker under contract with another employer .
Many agricultural laborers and sharecropper families who had borrowed money from their employer ( in order to subsist during the year ) were placed in debt peonage for several years .
States passed vagrancy laws aimed at restricting the occupational mobility and general free movement of African Americans .
One response of some African Americans in the south was to migrate to other parts of the nation ( Jaynes , forthcoming ) .
But the discriminatory practices employed in the South followed African Americans to northern cities , in different guises , and continued to expand and proliferate throughout most of the century . …………… …
Segregated schools were , and are , inferior schools ; we still have n't fixed them , fifty years after Brown v. Board of Education , and the inferior education they provided , then and now , helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today 's black and white students .
“ Re-segregation of the nation ’s public schools is a dramatic symptom of the negative impact of continued residential segregation .
It is also a litmus test for the significance of studies that purport to show increased [ residential ] integration .
The nation ’s public schools are re-segregating ( Orfield and Lee , 2004 ) .
By 2000 , minority students , particularly Latinos and African Americans , were in schools with substantially fewer white students than was the case in 1990 ( Orfield and Lee , 2004 ) .
And , between 1992 and 2002 , the number of minority students attending majority - minority schools also increased .
During the same period , the share of minority students attending public schools with white students declined .
( Orfield and Lee , 2004 ) . ……
Today , virtually all large school districts have greater levels of segregation of minority and low - income students than in 1986 , despite there being modest progress towards desegregation in the 1970s ( The Opportunity Agenda , 2006 ) .
Thus , although opinion polls show greater racial tolerance and acceptance of integration among white Americans , African American and Latino students today are less exposed to white students than they were in 1990 . "
Legalized discrimination - where blacks were prevented , often through violence , from owning property , or loans were not granted to African - American business owners , or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages , or blacks were excluded from unions , or the police force , or fire departments - meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations .
That history helps explain the wealth and income gap between black and white , and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persists in so many of today 's urban and rural communities .
“ …. Restrictive covenants were a critical tool in the creation of the black ghetto .
Restrictive covenants were contractual agreements among property owners to prohibit African Americans from owning or occupying homes in white neighborhoods .
After 1910 , restrictive covenants were being used widely throughout the U.S. ; indeed , they were found to be very effective in maintaining the color line .
Other mechanisms to bring about racial segregation included blockbusting , violence and intimidation , a variety of discriminatory practices by real estate agents , and predatory lending to minorities .
African Americans who faced violence to their property and person seldom found any redress from the authorities who chose to look the other way .
The federal government , in the 20th century , became an instrument of widespread and systematic discrimination in housing through the formal underwriting policies of the HOLC , FHA and VA .
The HOLC , established in 1933 as the first government - sponsored program to introduce long - term , self - amortizing mortgages on a mass scale , institutionalized the practice of redlining .
Under its system of rating loan - risks , loans for homes located in older central city neighborhoods , with racially or ethnically mixed populations , were rated as too risky ; and therefore , such loans were seldom approved .
Under HOLC - criteria , African American neighborhoods were inevitably redlined and not served .
The HOLC had not invented these racial standards of evaluating risks ; these practices were already widespread in the real estate industry by the 1920s .
But the HOLC took the lead in formally institutionalizing these practices .
HOLC practices became models for other lending institutions , both private and public .
According to Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton , the authors of the book American Apartheid , “ It [ HOLC ] lent the power , prestige , and support of the federal government to the systematic practice of racial discrimination in housing . ” ( Massey and Denton , 1993 , p. 52 ) .
The FHA and VA ( established in 1937 and 1944 , respectively ) followed HOLC ’s precedent ; they applied similar racially discriminatory standards on a massive scale in housing markets all across the Nation .
The FHA ’s 1939 Underwriting Manual stated that “ if a neighborhood is to retain stability , it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes . ”
( Jackson , 1985 , p. 208 ; see Exhibit 3 ) The FHA recommended the use of racially restrictive covenants in order to maintain the homogeneity of neighborhoods .
The result was that the vast majority of FHA and VA loans were for homes in white middle - class suburbs .
…… … Public housing was built at the most undesirable locations , and frequently at very high density .
Poor and lower income African Americans were displaced from the more disperse slums and adjacent black neighborhoods and put into the far more segregated and crowded public housing .
( Massey and Denton , 1993 ) .
There they lived in overcrowded conditions , removed from the rest of society , in unaesthetic concrete spaces .
Living conditions were not only physically undesirable , but were damaging to the human spirit .
Residents of public housing projects had few interactions with the rest of society .
According to historian Arnold Hirsch , public housing was a federally - sponsored “ second ghetto ” which was “ solidly institutionalized and frozen in concrete , ” and where “ government took an active hand not merely in reinforcing prevailing patterns of segregation , but in lending them a permanence never seen before . ”
( Hirsch , 1983 , pp. 252-54 ) . ”
Against the backdrop of a history of slavery , racial prejudice and discrimination , and Jim Crow laws , modern - day public programs and policies ( including an increasingly less progressive federal tax system ) have reinforced and enhanced large disparities in wealth between minority and white households .
In 1999 , the typical African American household had 59 cents of income and only 16 cents of wealth for every corresponding dollar in the typical white American household ; and the typical Latino American household had 59 cents of income and less than 10 cents of wealth for every corresponding dollar in the typical white American household ( Lui et al. , 2006 ) . ….
Interestingly , public perceptions do not always match this reality .
A 2001 national survey found that four in 10 white Americans believe that the typical African American earns as much or more than the typical white ( Morin , 2001 ) . "
A lack of economic opportunity among black men , and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one 's family , contributed to the erosion of black families - a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened .
And the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods …. helped create a cycle of violence , blight and neglect that continue to haunt us .
“ The Complex Economic and Social Impacts of Segregation
Years of ….. policies and practices of denial of opportunity have led to severe wealth disparities , including significant levels of poverty and concentrated poverty , in both black and Latino communities in cities across the nation .
Over 18 percent of poor African Americans and almost 14 percent of poor Latinos live in poverty neighborhoods ; in contrast , less than 6 percent of poor whites live in such neighborhoods ( Jargowsky , 2003 ) .
In fact , it is not only poor African Americans , but most African Americans who face a significant likelihood of living in poor neighborhoods .
Sociologist Lincoln Quillian has estimated that most African Americans , in contrast with only 10 percent of whites , will live in a poor neighborhood at some point in a decade ( Quillian , 2003 ) .
Poor black neighborhoods in U.S. cities underwent a transformation from the late 1970s to the 1980s ; the black ghetto increasingly became the jobless ghetto and a place with concentrated poverty ( Wilson , 1996 ) .
Previously , heavily segregated black neighborhoods contained both workers and jobless people .
But in the 1970s and 1980s , structural changes in the economy caused cutbacks in certain types of jobs .
Low - skilled and less educated workers who lived in such neighborhoods , and who were precluded by discriminatory housing market practices from relocating to areas of new job - growth , were severely impacted by the job cuts .
Increasingly , ghettoes became dominated by jobless adults and families .
High levels of crime , violence and drug - trafficking created extreme social disorder in America ’s jobless ghettos .
Joblessness contributed to a decline in marriage and the growth of out - of - wedlock births ( Wilson , 1996 ) .
A complex web of problems began to grow in the segregated , impoverished neighborhoods of America .
Hardworking , law - abiding families were not able to find avenues for upward mobility within the desperate conditions of the ghettoes .
There was a dearth of positive role models in such neighborhoods .
Residents here were condemned to the worst poverty of all — the poverty of hope .
….
In concentrated poverty communities , problems interact with each other and create a complex pathology , far more challenging than the individual problems .
While certain piecemeal interventions to address individual problems could have worked some fifty years ago , they are unlikely to make a dent in today ’s neighborhoods of concentrated poverty because an accumulation of layers of problems has resulted in whole new dimensions to the problems that defy piecemeal solutions .
Turning these neighborhoods around and providing their residents with hope and a constructive way of engaging in the mainstream economic life of the nation will require holistic , comprehensive approaches .
We demonstrate the complexity of the problems facing families in disadvantaged communities by means of two examples :
Access to quality education and mainstream financial services .

Stopping and cooling most of the atoms of the periodic table is now possible using a pair of techniques developed by physicist Mark Raizen at The University of Texas at Austin .
Raizen stopped atoms by passing a supersonic beam through an " atomic coilgun " and cooled them using " single - photon cooling . "
The techniques are a major step forward in atomic physics and have a variety of scientific and technological applications .
They could be used to determine the mass of the neutrino , which is the primary candidate for dark matter .
" Our methods open up whole new avenues of research , " says Raizen , professor of physics .
" We can control almost any atom and many molecules . "
The results , published in two papers in the March 7 issue of Physical Review Letters , are the culmination of years of work trapping and cooling atoms by Raizen and his research group .
To date , cooling atoms near the Absolute Zero ( - 459 degrees Fahrenheit ) has been accomplished using laser cooling , a method that was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 .
Despite its enormous success , laser cooling has been limited to a small set of atoms in the periodic table .

Raizen says his two methods can be used in tandem to trap and cool near Absolute Zero any of the paramagnetic atoms , which make up over 85 percent of the periodic table .
In one set of experiments , a supersonic beam of neon atoms was completely stopped using a 64 - stage coilgun .
( In prior studies , Raizen used an 18 - stage coilgun to slow neon atoms . )
The coilgun works by shooting a supersonic beam of atoms through a 3 - millimeter diameter bore wrapped by 64 magnetic coils made of copper wire ( thus , 64 stages ) .
The coils slow the atoms by making them climb a " magnetic hill . "
The hill is removed before the atoms have time to roll off and regain speed , and the atoms become magnetically trapped .
" The wonderful thing about the coilgun technology is its simplicity , " says Raizen .
" We use ordinary copper wire for the coils .
The hope is that this will allow others to use the technique to trap and cool the other elements . "
Key to the success of the coilgun is the use of supersonic beam technology developed by Raizen 's collaborator , Professor Uzi Even , from Tel - Aviv University .
In the other set of experiments , atoms were cooled using a method called " single - photon cooling . "
The atoms were trapped in a box made of green lasers fitted with an internal barrier -- a one - way wall of laser light that allows atoms to pass through one way and not the other .
It behaves much like a cellular membrane that allows ions to pass through in only one direction .
Researchers who worked on the atomic coilgun experiments from The University of Texas at Austin were Dr. Edvardas Narevicius , Adam Libson , Christian Parthey , Isaac Chavez and Julia Narevicius .
Single - photon cooling researchers include Gabriel Price , S. Travis Bannerman , Kirsten Viering and Narevicius .

Have a look .
So the good news is that going blind is not going to make you as unhappy as you think it will .
The bad news is that winning the lottery will not make you as happy as you expect .
Q. ARE YOU SAYING THAT PEOPLE ARE HAPPY WITH WHATEVER CARDS ARE DEALT TO THEM ?
A . As a species , we tend to be moderately happy with whatever we get .
If you take a scale that goes from zero to 100 , people , generally , report their happiness at about 75 .
We keep trying to get to 100 .
Sometimes , we get there .
But we do n’t stay long .
We certainly fear the things that would get us down to 20 or 10  the death of a loved one , the end of a relationship , a serious challenge to our health .
But when those things happen , most of us will return to our emotional baselines more quickly than we ’d predict .
Humans are wildly resilient .

Q. DO MOST OF US HARBOR UNREASONABLE NOTIONS OF WHAT HAPPINESS IS ?
A. Inaccurate , flawed ideas .
Few of us can accurately gauge how we will feel tomorrow or next week .
That ’s why when you go to the supermarket on an empty stomach , you ’ll buy too much , and if you shop after a big meal , you ’ll buy too little .
Another factor that makes it difficult to forecast our future happiness is that most of us are rationalizers .
We expect to feel devastated if our spouse leaves us or if we get passed over for a big promotion at work .
But when things like that do happen , it ’s soon , “ She never was right for me , ” or “ I actually need more free time for my family . ”
People have remarkable talent for finding ways to soften the impact of negative events .
Thus they mistakenly expect such blows to be much more devastating than they turn out to be .
It has been a rough year for MediaDefender and their parent company ArtistDirect .
This September nearly 700 mb of MediaDefender 's emails leaked to the public .
Initially it did n't seem to affect the stock price much , but after the financial consequences became apparent , their net worth plunged .
With still a few days to go it is probably safe to say that MediaDefender is one of the biggest losers of 2007 .
The leaked emails , published by the notorious “ MediaDefender - Defenders “ , gave away a lot of sensitive information and details about how MediaDefender sabotaged BitTorrent trackers and other file - sharing networks .
Despite the fact that their decoy and spoofing operations were hugely ineffective on most BitTorrent sites , the company collected millions of dollars from the entertainment industry for protecting their content .
Unfortunately for them , one of their employees was stupid enough to forward all his work email to his Gmail account , without using a proper password .
To make it even worse , more sensitive information started to leak as the email leak was soon followed by a p2p tracking database , a phone call and a collection of anti-piracy tools they used for their daily operations .
Soon after this sensitive information became public , the Pirate Bay launched a counterattack .
They decided to use the information from the emails to file charges against some of MediaDefenders customers including Paramount Home Entertainment , Twentieth Century Fox and Universal Music Group for corrupting and sabotaging their BitTorrent tracker .
The leak did not have any effect on the stock price initially , but after the company announced that it had cost them $ 825,000 , it started to drop hard .
It turned out that MediaDefender ’s parent company ArtistDirect spent $ 600,000 to compensate their customers and the rest of the money was used to cover legal expenses .
The investors were n’t too happy about this news as can be seen from the picture below .
So what will happen now , will the company walk the plank to bankruptcy ?
Many people think it will , but MediaDefender still sees a future in the anti-piracy business .
Sure , they were devastated by the leaks , but remarkably , they believe that it did n’t hurt the goodwill of the company .
Makes you wonder what is needed to hurt this then , because it ca n’t get any worse if you ask me .
I ’m sure we will hear from them again in 2008 .
A San Diego start - up says it is using algae to make oil that can be refined into gasoline and other fuels that are both renewable and carbon - neutral , and it plans to produce 10,000 barrels a day within five years .
That 's a fraction of the 20 million or so barrels of petroleum the United States consumes each day , but Sapphire Energy says " green crude " production could ramp up to a level sufficient to ease our dependence on foreign oil , if not end it altogether .
Company CEO Jason
Pyle says the algal oil is chemically identical to light sweet crude and compatible with America 's $ 1.5 trillion petroleum infrastructure , making it a direct replacement for oil .
Although the algal fuels refined from it emit as much carbon dioxide as conventional fuels , the company says the emissions are offset by the photosynthetic process that uses sunlight , water and C02 to create algal crude .
" At the very worst , it 's carbon neutral , " Pyle says , calling the fuels a " benchmark for an entire new industry " and " a paradigm change . "
Energy experts and air quality regulators say they 'll withhold judgment on those claims until they 've seen a production - to - combustion analysis of the fuel 's emissions .
But they say Sapphire could be on to something .
Making fuel from algae is nothing new , and a lot of organizations , from the smallest start - up to the biggest oil companies , are trying to find the best way to do it .
But most of the effort has been on replacing diesel fuel or kerosene .
Sapphire wants to replace petroleum .
" We designed it to be a completely fungible product with crude oil , " Pyle says .
He says the company has refined its algal crude into 91 - octane gasoline , diesel fuel and kerosene chemically identical to conventional fuels .
He would n't disclose how the process works or what it costs but said it is competitive with deep - water oil drilling and extracting petroleum from tar sands .
Sapphire also avoids the food - for - fuel debate that has plagued crop - based biofuels because it uses algae and works on non-arable land with non-potable water .
Pyle would n't say where Sapphire plans to build the demonstration plant it will have running later this year , but it 's reportedly working in Oklahoma and may locate its facilities in the South and Southwest .
It hopes to have a full - scale plant up and running within five years , producing 10,000 barrels of green crude a day .
The company has lined up more than $ 50 million in funding from investors like ARCH Venture Partners .
Ramping up to that level of production without killing the algae can be tricky , one expert said , and the environmental impact of green crude remain to be seen .
Even if it is carbon neutral , the algal fuels will emit pollutants that contribute to smog and ozone , says Don Anair of the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" You 're still going to get combustion emissions .
You are n't eliminating those with algal fuels , " he says , echoing a point the California Air Resources Board made .
Still , Anair is cautiously optimistic .
" The fact that there is a lot of interest in finding a better way to fuel our transportation system is encouraging , " he says .
" This is one avenue to pursue that has very good potential . "

A 15 - STRONG gang attacked a young man after chasing him for almost half - a- mile .
The 19 - year - old was walking down Manchester Road , Thornton Lodge , at 9.30 pm on Saturday to meet his girlfriend when he saw the gang standing on a grass verge on St Thomas ’ Road .
They started to chase him and he fled along Manchester Road and then up steps next to St Thomas ’ Church at Longroyd Bridge to Water Street in Springwood .
The gang cornered him in a garden there and beat him with baseball bats and pieces of wood .
He was left badly bruised and needed treatment at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary .
Det Con Russ Conlon , from Kirklees CID intelligence unit , said : “ This was a motiveless attack .
“ We would urge anyone who saw this gang hanging around , chasing the victim or the attack itself to come forward . ’’
All the attackers are young Asian men and there were about 15 of them .
The ringleader is aged about 20 , 5ft 8in tall and slim .
He wore a plain grey hooded top .
Anyone with information should contact Pc James Bellhouse on 0845 6060606 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
After months of delay , the United States has established an embassy in Baghdad , the State Department said Monday .
Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy said Monday he signed a " certificate of occupancy , " which gives the United States ownership of the heavily fortified embassy compound inside the Green Zone and allows staff to move into its 27 buildings .
Kennedy said that before he approved final occupancy , he got assurances from a team of experts who tested the fire , electrical , mechanical and communications systems inside the buildings .
The sprawling facility will provide secure housing for U.S. personnel who currently live and work in Saddam Hussein 's former Republican Palace , which has increasingly come under fire inside the Green Zone .
U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told reporters Friday he expected officials to begin moving into the facility in late May or early June .
A recent spike in insurgent attacks that killed several Americans in the Green Zone prompted the State Department to order U.S. Embassy personnel not to leave reinforced buildings .
A shortage of such space has forced some diplomats to temporarily sleep at the new embassy compound , despite the lack of occupancy certification .
" It 's been a difficult few weeks , rockets are bouncing off your buildings , and maintaining focus can be an occasional challenge , " Crocker said .
" We worry a lot less about formal safety certifications and a lot more about ensuring people have a place to sleep where rockets could n't get at them . "
The Vatican - size compound , which will be the largest U.S. diplomatic facility in the world , was scheduled to open in September at a cost of $ 592 million , but the price tag is expected to rise to more than $ 730 million .
Completion delays , safety concerns and new requirements for additional secure office space for the U.S. ambassador and the commander of multinational forces in Iraq delayed the project by six months .
The project started 2½ years ago .
Concerns over the fire detection systems also slowed completion of the embassy , and drew criticism from Congress .
CNN has reported on U.S. Embassy documents that detailed such problems in the complex as poor quality construction , faulty electrical wiring , malfunctioning fire systems and unacceptable formaldehyde fumes in some of the compound 's buildings , which the U.S. government ordered repaired .
Congress also has voiced concern over charges of fraud against the main contractor , First Kuwait .
Based on congressional testimony , it is believed the U.S. Justice Department is conducting an investigation into the embassy project .

Hillary Clinton attends the Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington .
So does Bill Clinton .
Hillary suggests she would not have the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Barack Obama 's controversial former minister , as her pastor .
But the senior pastor of her church has a very different take on how Americans should react to Wright .
The Rev. Dean Snyder wrote , " The Rev. Jeremiah Wright is an outstanding church leader whom I have heard speak a number of times .
He has served for decades as a profound voice for justice and inclusion in our society .
He has been a vocal critic of the racism , sexism , and homophobia which still tarnish the American dream .
" To evaluate his dynamic ministry on the basis of two or three sound bites does a grave injustice to Dr. Wright , the members of his congregation , and the African - American church , which has been the spiritual refuge of a people that has suffered from discrimination , disadvantage , and violence .
Dr. Wright , a member of an integrated denomination , has been an agent of racial reconciliation while proclaiming perceptions and truths uncomfortable for some white people to hear .
" Those of us who are white Americans would do well to listen carefully to Dr. Wright rather than to use a few of his quotes to polarize .
This is a critical time in America 's history as we seek to repent of our racism .
No matter which candidates prevail , let us use this time to listen again to one another and not to distort one another 's truth . "

Funny how that recent memo from Hillary Clinton loyalist Harold Ickes recapping all sorts of positive poll numbers for her did n't include a survey from her neck of the woods .
A late April poll of New Jersey voters by Braun Research found -- no real surprise -- that either Clinton or Barack Obama would win the state and its 15 electoral votes in November against John McCain .
The surprise was that Obama ran substantially ahead of McCain , more so than Clinton .
He beat the presumptive Republican presidential nominee by 24 percentage points ; her margin was 14 points .
And here was the real shocker :
In a state where Clinton , senator from neighboring New York , won the Feb.
5 primary by 10 points , 45 % of Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents now said they wanted to see Obama as the party 's nominee , compared with 38 % who picked Clinton .
Less than three months after Clinton 's primary win , " some New Jersey voters feel buyer ’s remorse , ” said poll director Patrick Murray .
The survey was conducted largely before the Rev. Jeremiah Wright 's rancorous session at the National Press Club in Washington last week caused major political turmoil for Obama , so perhaps a snapshot taken this week of voter attitudes in the Garden State might not be so rosy for him .
By the same token , the Braun poll was taken in the immediate wake of Clinton 's intensive campaign -- and solid primary win -- in Pennsylvania , a state that shares several media markets with a fair chunk of New Jersey .

Only two things really matter about last night 's debate .
First , it was probably the worst performance by " moderators " in a presidential debate .
Ever .
It really was that bad , and we cannot let that happen again where Democratic positions are under relentless attack by the moderators without a Republican candidate on stage .
It was n't a debate , it was an interrogation .
The only difference between the ABC interrogation and an interrogation perpetrated by the Bush administration was that ABC probably never considered waterboarding .
As for the Democratic nomination , here 's the only exchange from last night that mattered :
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me pick up on this .
When these comments from Senator Obama broke on Friday , Senator McCain 's campaign immediately said that it was going to be a killer issue in November .
Senator Clinton , when Bill Richardson called you to say he was endorsing Barack Obama , you told him that Senator Obama can't win .
I 'm not going to ask you about that conversation .
I know you do n't want to talk about it .
But a simple yes - or - no question :
Do you think Senator Obama can beat John McCain or not ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , I think we have to beat John McCain , and I have every reason to believe we 're going to have a Democratic president and it's going to be either Barack or me .
And we 're going to make that happen .
And what is important is that we understand exactly the challenges facing us in order to defeat Senator McCain .
He will be a formidable candidate .
There is n't any doubt about that .
He has a great American story to tell .
He 's a man who has served our country with distinction over many years , but he has the wrong ideas about America .
And those ideas will be tested in the cauldron of this campaign .
But I also know , having now gone through 16 years of being on the receiving end of what the Republican Party dishes out , how important it is that we try to go after every single vote everywhere we possibly can to get to those electoral votes that we 're going to need to have the next president elected .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But the question is , do you think Senator Obama can do that ?
Can he win ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Yes .
Yes .
Yes .
Hillary Clinton and her surrogates have petulantly claimed that the reason why she should stick around after it's clear that there 's no way she 'll overcome Barack Obama 's lead among pledged delegates is that the superdelegates could decide to go with her instead of Obama .
The superdelegates ' rationale for doing so would presumably need to be based on questions of electability .
Hillary Clinton , in the exchange quoted above , said there is no electability argument that can be used against Barack Obama .
The voters have demonstrated a clear preference for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton .
She can not overcome his lead .
Hillary Clinton acknowledges that Barack Obama can beat John McCain .
Thus , she 's lost , and she has no argument that it 's a threat to Democrats to have Barack Obama as our nominee .
Therefore , there 's no reason for Hillary Clinton to continue her campaign .
UCLA Medical Center and its most accomplished liver surgeon provided a life - saving transplant to one of Japan ’s most powerful gang bosses , law enforcement sources told The Times .
In addition , the surgeon performed liver transplants at UCLA on three other men who are now barred from entering the United States because of their criminal records or suspected affiliation with Japanese organized crime groups , said a knowledgeable law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The four surgeries were done between 2000 and 2004 at a time of pronounced organ scarcity .
In each of those years , more than 100 patients died awaiting liver transplants in the Greater Los Angeles region .
The surgeon in each case was Dr. Ronald W. Busuttil , executive chairman of UCLA ’s surgery department , according to another person familiar with the matter who also spoke on condition of anonymity .
Busuttil is a world - renowned liver surgeon who co-edited a leading text on liver transplantation and is one of the highest - paid employees in the University of California system .
Advertisement
There is no evidence that UCLA or Busuttil knew at the time of the transplants that any of the patients had ties to Japanese gangs , commonly called yakuza .
Both said in statements that they do not make moral judgments about patients and treat them based on their medical need .
U.S. transplant rules do not prohibit hospitals from performing transplants on either foreign patients or those with criminal histories .
The most prominent transplant recipient , Tadamasa Goto , had been barred from entering the U.S. because of his criminal history , several current and former law enforcement officials said .
Goto leads a gang called the Goto - gumi , which experts describe as vindictive and at times brutal .
The FBI helped Goto obtain a visa to enter the United States in 2001 in exchange for leads on potentially illegal activity in this country by Japanese criminal gangs , said Jim Stern , retired chief of the FBI ’s Asian criminal enterprise unit in Washington .

Goto got his liver , Stern said , but provided the bureau with little useful information on Japanese gangs .
“ I do n’t think Goto gave the bureau anything of significance , ” Stern said .
Goto “ came to the States and got a liver and was laughing back to where he came from .
. . .
It defies logic . ”
Although Stern was not involved with the deal , he said he learned the details when he became unit chief in 2004 and continues to be troubled by what happened .
After the transplant , Goto was again barred from reentering the U.S. , said the first law enforcement official , who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and therefore requested anonymity .

But Goto continued to receive medical care from Busuttil in Japan .
The doctor traveled there and examined Goto on more than one occasion , said Goto ’s Tokyo - based lawyer , Yoshiyuki Maki -- and evaluated Goto while he was in custody in 2006 .
Busuttil ’s medical opinion was cited in a successful court petition to have Goto released for medical care at a Tokyo hospital , Maki said .
The Times is not naming the other three transplant recipients in this article because neither they nor their lawyers could be reached .
Several transplant experts and bioethicists contacted by The Times said they were troubled by the transplants , especially because organs are in such short supply in this country .
In the year of Goto ’s surgery , 186 people in the Los Angeles region died waiting for a liver , U.S. transplant statistics show .
Advertisement
Some , but not all , of the experts said a transplant center has an obligation to determine whether a patient would be a worthy custodian of an organ and to protect potential donors ’ faith in the system .
“ If you want to destroy public support for organ donation on the part of Americans , you ’d be hard pressed to think of a practice that would be better suited , ” said Arthur Caplan , a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania .
In a statement , the UCLA Health System said it could not comment on specific cases because of federal patient privacy laws .
Generally , it said it complies with all the rules and regulations of the United Network for Organ Sharing , the federal contractor charged with ensuring the safety and fairness of the U.S. transplant system .
Last year , UCLA performed more liver transplants than any other U.S. hospital .
“ UCLA ’s processes for evaluating a patient -- both for mental and physical suitability for organ transplants -- are the same regardless of whether the individual is a U.S. citizen or a foreign national , ” the statement said .
Advertisement
Hospitals and doctors in the U.S. have the final say on which patients get added to their waiting lists and have the discretion to refuse patients with unhealthy lifestyles that could compromise the transplant ’s success .
Patients may be refused on other grounds as well , including an inability to pay .
At the time of Goto ’s 2001 transplant , liver allocations were made based on both a patient ’s medical status and waiting time .
Since 2002 , livers have been allocated to patients based almost entirely on how sick they are .
It is unclear when Goto joined UCLA ’s waiting list .
He had been in the United States two months when he received a new liver .
Overall , 34 % of the patients added to UCLA ’s liver waiting list between January 1999 and December 2001 received a new liver within three years of being listed , national transplant statistics show .
Busuttil , a former president of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons who has testified before Congress on who should receive priority for transplants , released his own statement this week .
He did not directly address the transplants of the Japanese patients but said in part :
Advertisement
“ As a surgeon , it is not my role to pass moral judgment on the patients who seek my care .
. . .
If one of my patients , domestic or international , were in a situation that could be life - threatening , of course I would do everything in my power to assure that they would receive proper care .
“ I consider that to be part of my responsibility and obligation as a physician . ”

‘ A serious player ’

On May 18 , 2001 , Tadamasa Goto boarded Japan Airlines Flight 0062 at Narita International Airport , bound for Los Angeles with his son Masato .
Goto , now 65 , had hepatitis C and was worried it would develop into cancer , Maki , Goto ’s lawyer , said in an interview last week in his Tokyo office .
Because Japan has an extreme shortage of organ donors , many sick patients feel they need to go abroad to seek treatment .
The FBI did not help Goto arrange his surgery with UCLA but did help him gain entry to this country , Stern said .
The agency had long been frustrated by the reluctance of Japanese law enforcement to share information on yakuza members in the United States .
“ For American law enforcement , it ’s been like pulling teeth to get criminal intelligence from Japanese authorities , ” said David Kaplan , a journalist who co-wrote the book “ Yakuza : Japan ’s Criminal Underworld , ” published in 2003 by the University of California Press .
Advertisement
In his book , Kaplan describes Goto ’s gang , the Goto - gumi , as an offshoot of the largest Japanese organized crime group , the Yamaguchi - gumi .
In an interview , Kaplan said Goto is “ a serious player in the yakuza .
His gang is known for being particularly ruthless and violent . ”
A senior member of the group and an affiliated gang member were sentenced to prison for the 1992 slashing of a Japanese director whose film portrayed the yakuza as violent thugs , according to a story in the Japan Times .
Goto was not personally implicated in the case .
Goto underwent a successful transplant in July 2001 .
He received the liver of a young man who died in a traffic accident , Maki said .
“ Goto is over 60 now , but his liver is young , ” he said .
Several years after the transplant , in May 2006 , Goto was arrested in Japan on suspicion of real estate fraud .
Advertisement
Maki said he and other lawyers worried that their client was not well enough to be interrogated .
In addition to his liver problem , Goto was suffering from heart disease , high blood pressure and diabetes .
The lawyers asked that Goto be released immediately , but authorities rejected the request , Maki said .
He said the lawyers asked that Goto be given his medication at precise times , but that did not happen either .
“ Goto lost his appetite , had a terrible headache , scratched his arm until it started to get infected , and he was throwing up , ” Maki said .
Maki used the interview to vent against Japanese prosecutors , saying he believes they were attempting to exploit his client ’s poor health to obtain a conviction on what Maki considered groundless charges .
He said Busuttil , along with doctors from Tokyo University Hospital and Showa University Hospital in Tokyo , examined Goto and recommended that he be released for outside medical treatment .
Advertisement
On May 24 , 2006 , some 16 days after he was arrested , the court temporarily released Goto and he entered the hospital .
Goto was acquitted of the charges in March of this year .
“ The UCLA doctor [ Busuttil ] examined Goto during his detention and again one week after he received his not - guilty ruling , ” Maki said .
The law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Goto ’s criminal history includes prison time .
But Maki said that his client ’s last conviction was three decades ago , for assault , and that his previous convictions were as a youth .
Advertisement
Court records in Japan are kept by prosecutors who generally do not share them with anyone not party to a case .
Jake Adelstein , a former reporter at Japan ’s largest daily newspaper , Yomiuri Shimbun , said he received a tip about the circumstances surrounding Goto ’s liver transplant in 2005 .
Within days of making inquiries , however , Adelstein was visited by men who told him : “ Erase the story or be erased , ” he said in an interview .
Adelstein did not pursue the story but mentioned the incident in a recent opinion piece in the Washington Post .
He said he would elaborate on it in a forthcoming book .

Dealing with scandals
Word of the surgeries at UCLA comes as the U.S. transplant system is slowly recovering from scandals that forced the closure of three transplant programs in California .
In one of those , St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles moved a Saudi national up a liver waiting list , bypassing dozens of others , and then covered it up by falsifying paperwork , officials there have acknowledged .
Overseers of the U.S. transplant system say they are unaware of other cases in which hospitals have provided organs to foreign criminals .
But some hospitals , including Stanford University Medical Center , have performed transplants on U.S. prisoners -- often controversial because taxpayers foot the bill .
According to the ethics committee of the United Network for Organ Sharing , “ one ’s status as a prisoner should not preclude them from consideration for a transplant . ”
Advertisement
The network encourages transplant programs to give foreign recipients less than 5 % of organs from deceased donors each year , but that is not a hard - and - fast rule .
At one point , in the 1980s , the threshold was 10 % , but it was lowered after Congress considered banning transplants for foreign nationals entirely .
Centers that exceed the 5 % guideline are asked for an explanation in writing , but none has been sanctioned publicly .
In 2001 , the year Goto received his transplant , UCLA slightly exceeded the guideline .
Typically , transplant experts say , foreigners cannot receive transplants at U.S. centers unless they are willing to pay the full cost of the procedure out of pocket -- without the substantial discounts given to insurers .
Charges for a liver transplant and immediate follow - up care generally exceed $ 523,000 , according to an April report by Milliman Inc. , an actuarial firm .
It could not be determined how much UCLA and Busuttil were paid for the Japanese transplants .
Advertisement
Tom Mone , chief executive of OneLegacy , the group responsible for procuring and distributing organs in much of Southern California , said transplants for foreign criminals are “ an unfortunate result of a system that ’s magnanimous to the world . ”
Mone also said hospitals do not have the resources to investigate their patients .
“ The enforcement should be at the borders , not at the hospital , ” he said .
In recent years , nonresident foreign nationals have accounted for less than 1 % of all transplant recipients nationwide , transplant statistics show .
Dr. Mark Fox , associate director of the Oklahoma Bioethics Center , said the UCLA transplants may create pressure to eliminate transplants for foreign nationals entirely , which Fox said he does not support .
Advertisement
“ For some people , there are misgivings for transplanting foreign nationals at all .
For some people , there are misgivings about transplanting criminals at all , ” he said .
“ When you put those two together , it is certainly reasonable to expect that a certain portion of the population would say , ‘ This is not what I expected when I signed my donor card . ’ ”

Last week , Hillary Clinton released a statement celebrating the tenth anniversary of the historic Good Friday Agreement that led to peace in Northern Ireland .
She noted ,
Ultimately , the real credit for peace can only go to the brave people of Northern Ireland , as well as the leaders of Ireland and the U.K .
But I also know that helping to advance the peace process and to achieve the Good Friday Agreement is one of my husband ’s proudest accomplishments as President .
And I too am proud to have played a role in that effort .
The statement–and Clinton ’s assertion that she had been part of the peace process–did not draw much media notice , a sign that her Irish troubles might have eased .
Last month , the Barack Obama campaign had challenged her claim to have “ helped to bring peace to Northern Island . ”
And that triggered a transatlantic tempest .
David Trimble , the former First Minister of the Northern Ireland , called Clinton “ a wee bit silly ” for claiming to have been a figure of an importance in the peace process :
She visited when things were happening , saw what was going on , she can certainly say it was part of her experience .
I do n’t want to rain on the thing for her but being a cheerleader for something is slightly different from being a principal player .
But then Clinton ’s campaign posted on its website a statement from John Hume , who shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with Trimble , in which Hume declared : “ I can state from firsthand experience that she played a positive role for over a decade in helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland . ”
And Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams told the Irish Times that Clinton played an important role in the peace process .
I met the senator on many occasions ….
I always found her to be extremely well - informed on the issues . ”
These endorsements from Hume and Adams did not fully support the claims from Clinton and her camp that she had been a significant participant in the Irish peace process .
On NPR , she had said , “ I was n’t sitting at the negotiating table , but the role I played was instrumental . ”
And appearing on CNN on March 4 , Terry McAuliffe , her campaign chairman , had said , “ We would not have peace today had it not [ been ] for Hillary ’s hard work in Northern Ireland . ”
Still , Hume ’s and Adams ’ statements did somewhat counter Trimble ’s dismissive remarks .
And the campaign flare - up flared down .
But what was the truth ?
Had Clinton been instrumental ?
Was McAuliffe correct to say Northern Ireland would today be a bloody landscape had it not been for Clinton ?
Looking for an expert on the Irish peace process , I contacted Paul Bew .
He is a prominent–perhaps the most prominent–historian of Northern Ireland .
A professor at Queen ’s University Belfast , Bew last year published Ireland : The Politics of Enmity 1789 - 2006 , a much - acclaimed work , which is part of the Oxford University Press ’s Modern Europe series .
He once was an adviser to Trimble , and he was appointed to the House of Lords in 2007 , in recognition of his own contributions to the Good Friday Agreement .
When I asked Bew about Clinton ’s claim , he chuckled and replied : “ There is a simple point to be made . ”
He referred me to a new book by Jonathan Powell , Great Hatred , Little Room : Making Peace in Northern Ireland .
Powell was chief of staff to British Prime Minister Tony Blair , and his book , which has been a sensation in England , is an insider ’s account of the peace talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement .
Look at the index of this book for “ Hillary Clinton , ” Bew told me .
There is , he said , “ only one reference to Hillary Clinton . ”
Bew was right about that .
That one citation refers the reader to a tangential anecdote in which Powell mistakes a female Secret Service agent assigned to First Lady Clinton for a friend ( Nancy Soderberg , a national security aide in the Clinton White House ) and cheekily asks for a kiss .
“ That ’s it , ” Bew said .
“ The only reference to Hillary Clinton in this detailed blow - by - blow account .
This is more telling than any other particular point … .
It is very revealing . ”
Powell ’s book aside , I asked Bew , whose own book covers the Irish peace accords ( and who also published a collection of his real - time journalistic accounts of the Good Friday Agreement ) , how he assessed Clinton ’s claim to have been “ instrumental ” in bringing peace to Northern Ireland .
“ She just was not there , ” he said .
“ Calling her instrumental is silly … .
I ca n’t think of anything to be said for the case that she had a major role . ”
For the moment , this campaign controversy appears to be done .
But if Clinton ’s Irish troubles return , perhaps the definitive–and last–word can go to the guys who wrote the books .
This article was written by Maggie Koerth - Baker & Laurel Mills , and appears in the March - April 2007 issue of mental_floss magazine .
Sure , you know these five creatures as stinging , biting merchants of death .
But is n't it time we put aside our differences and embraced the positive ?
1. Poison Dart Frogs : The Heart - Healthy Choice
It Could Kill You :
You know an animal is bad news when its sweat was once considered a state - of - the - art military technology .
Meet the poison dart frog , which secretes a highly dangerous neurotoxin , called batrachotoxin , through its pores .
In fact , various Latin American tribes used to collect the stuff ( carefully ) to poison the tips of their arrows for hunting and warfare .
Interestingly , however , the frogs do n't produce their own toxin .
They get it from eating insects that most likely pick up the poison from the plants they consume .
The same frogs , if raised in a laboratory rather than the rain forest , are n't poisonous at all .
But It Just Might Cure
You : Before batrachotoxin stops your heart , it speeds it up .
Consequently , medical experts believe it might be possible to tweak elements of the frog 's toxin to bring patients out of cardiac arrest and potentially save lives .
And because it also deadens nerve endings , batrachotoxin has potential as an ingredient in anesthetics .
Studies into other uses of the toxin are still in the early stages , but the frog 's medical benefits bolster the argument for preserving the rainforest .
Most scientists believe we 've only just begun to grasp the pharmaceutical possibilities of some of the world 's rarest and deadliest creatures .

2. Scorpions : Leading the battle against Brain Cancer
It Could Kill You :
For the most part , scorpions use their toxins to capture prey , ward off competitors during mating season , and defend themselves against larger predators .
Unfortunately , humans count as larger predators .
A sting by some species can leave you with any number of potentially deadly conditions , including heart and lung failure .
But It Just Might Cure You : Medical researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) have discovered a new use for scorpion venom — in cancer medication .
Each year , some 9,000 Americans are diagnosed with malignant glioma , a form of brain cancer that kills about half its victims within a year of diagnosis .
Glioma cells work a lot like cockroach muscle cells .
And while that fact is pretty disgusting , it also got UAB researchers thinking about the giant Israeli scorpion , whose venom is harmless to humans but deadly to its cockroach prey .
Doctors found that when they injected a drug derived from the venom of giant Israeli scorpions into cancer - infected human brains , the poison destroyed the glioma cells and left surrounding , healthy cells alone .
The treatment is still in the early stages of development , but researchers remain optimistic .

3. Cone Shell Snails : Little Creatures Tackling Big Pain
It Could Kill You :
Thanks to their unique colors and intricate patterns , cone shells look like they 'd make great beach souvenirs .
But watch your fingers ; they 're actually home to one of the world 's deadliest creatures .
Cone shell snails come equipped with an extendable " arm " — complete with a sharp , venomous tooth — that they use to immobilize and kill prey .
And while the venom certainly helps the slow - moving hunters from going hungry , it can also paralyze , or even kill , victims .
The good news : Death by cone shell is completely painless .
But It Just Might Cure
You :
Cone shell venom , called conotoxin , has incredible potential as a painkiller , with one added bonus :
Unlike many current anesthetics , conotoxin is n't addictive .
In 2005 , Ireland - based Elan Pharmaceuticals became the first company to market a drug made from the venom .
Called Prialt , the drug is pumped into the fluid around a patient 's spine to relieve chronic pain and is believed to be up to 1,000 times more powerful than morphine .
Meanwhile , at the University of Melbourne , a research team headed by Professor Bruce Livett is currently developing another conotoxin - based painkiller called ACV1 , which was first tested on humans in the summer of 2005 .
Unlike Prialt , however , ACV1 does n't affect a patient 's blood pressure and can be injected under the skin , making it a lot less intimidating .
Plus , ACV1 is believed to be as much as 10,000 times stronger than morphine .

4. Vipers : Lowering Your Blood Pressure Since 1981
It Could Kill You :
Most vipers are scary enough as is , but jararaca vipers are venomous to boot .
But what 's truly fascinating is the unique way their venom works .
Unlike a traditional toxin , viper venom functions by preventing the blood from clotting , meaning the snakes actually kill their victims by causing them to bleed to death .
But It Just Might Cure
You : Lucky for us , slow - clotting blood is n't always a bad thing .
Researchers have found that small doses of viper venom can prevent arteries from hardening , thus stopping the kinds of blood clots that commonly occur in cardiac patients .
In fact , jararaca viper venom ( or at least a synthesized version of it ) is a key ingredient in most of today 's ACE inhibitors .
Introduced in 1981 , ACE inhibitors work by slowing down the body 's angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) .
When left untreated , the enzyme can produce a peptide that causes muscle constriction around blood vessels .
That kind of constriction can set off a chain reaction whereby a person 's blood vessels narrow and his or her blood pressure shoots through the roof , leading to greater risk of heart attack and other ailments .
Because the ACE inhibitors can stop this domino effect , they 're frequently used to treat millions of men and women with high blood pressure .

5. Gila Monsters : Attacking Type 2 Diabetes
It Could Kill You :
One of only two species of venomous lizards , the Gila monster is native to southwestern United States and northern Mexico .
Unlike other deadly critters , Gila monsters do n't inject venom directly into their victims .
Instead , poison oozes from the lizard 's teeth into the open wounds of its prey , usually while the Gila monster is chewing .
Because of this , human fatalities from Gila monster bites are rare , but a bite can cause intense pain , nausea , swelling , fatigue , dizziness , and chills — none of which is particularly fun .
But It Just Might Cure
You :
In addition to causing all those nasty side effects , Gila monster venom stimulates insulin production and slows down glucose production , which is great news for diabetics .
Byetta , a drug manufactured by Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly & Company to treat Type 2 diabetes , uses a manufactured form of Gila monster venom as its main ingredient .
Approved by the FDA in April of 2005 , Byetta is injected before meals to help their bodies produce the right amount of insulin at the right time — the best part being that it does n't cause the mood swings often associated with traditional insulin regimens .

Data collected by the BitTorrent client Azureus shows that Comcast might only be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to BitTorrent throttling ISPs .
Early findings show that customers from quite a few other Internet service providers experience an unusually high amount of TCP - resets .
ISPs have been throttling BitTorrent traffic for quite a while , but only since the Comcast debacle has this been picked up by mainstream media .
A few months ago Azureus petitioned the FCC , which led to a FCC hearing in February .
One of the complaints from the commission was that there is little data available on the scope of BitTorrent throttling , a gap Azureus now tries to fill by collecting data on the prevalence of TCP - resets among ISPs worldwide .
Last month Azureus published a plugin through which users can help distinguishing the good from the bad ISPs , and today we have a preview of some early findings .
A massive 1,000,000 hours of data from over 8000 users has been collected over the past few weeks .
The preliminary results again confirm that Comcast continues to use TCP - resets to manage BitTorrent traffic on their network , but they are not alone .
The rest of the Vuze / Azureus report ( pdf ) includes the median reset rates for hundreds of other ISPs
ISP Country Reset % Comcast USA 23.72 % Cogeco Canada 19.13 % Emirates Internet UAE 17.86 % Cablevision USA 17.58 % Brasil Telecom Santa Catarina , Brazil 17.43 % TM Net Malaysia 16.80 % BellSouth USA 15.88 % Tedata Egypt 15.33 % Tiscali UK 14.89 % AOL USA 14.88 %
TCP resets seem to be more common for American ISPs , and Comcast leads the bunch .
The Azureus team has sent a letter to Cablevision , Cogeco , BellSouth and AOL , where they request that the companies are open about their BitTorrent throttling practices .
Thus far , the ISPs have not responded to the letters .
At the bottom of the list we see the good ISPs , mostly from Europe .
There are other ways to throttle BitTorrent traffic , besides using TCP - resets , a list of ISPs who are known to limit BitTorrent traffic is available on the Azureus Wiki .
It has to be noted that the data gathering techniques Vuze uses are far from optimal .
The plugin detects all TCP resets on a connection and does n’t make a distinction between BitTorrent and other traffic , and there is no control group .
The Azureus / Vuze team will continue to collect data , and stated :
“ We believe that there is sufficient data to suggest that network management practices that ‘ throttle ’ Internet traffic are widespread .
At a minimum , more investigation is required to determine whether these resets are happening in the ordinary course of business or whether they represent the kind of throttling practices which target specific applications and / or protocols , harming the consumer experience and stifling innovation . ”
The preliminary results presented here do indeed indicate that Comcast is not the only ISP that uses TCP resets to slow down BitTorrent traffic .

Your hybrid ( TGW ) – Engineers in the U.K. have developed a new kind of hybrid that is able to switch between being a two - stroke and a four - stroke engine , which cuts fuel usage 27 % .
The improved fuel consumption essentially comes from downsizing the engine .
" A smaller engine has less internal friction and delivers better fuel consumption , " said Neville Jackson , technology director of Ricardo UK , which developed the engine .
The two stroke internal combustion engine differs from the more common four stroke engine by completing the same four processes ( intake , compression , combustion , exhaust ) in only two strokes of the piston rather than four .
( Wikipedia Small car engines are usually based on the four stroke engine , which does n’t offer as much power .
They can be particularly problematic when operated at low speeds with a high load , such as when accelerating uphill .
This new engine , 2/ 4SIGHT , can switch between the two stroke and four stroke engine depending on need .

Just thinking about laughing makes you feel better .
Chuckle vision : even thinking about laughing can make you feel less stressed .
Punchstock
They say that laughter is the best medicine , and now research is beginning to prove that this adage might be truer than we think .
Laughter has long been known to make people happier , but a new study has shown that even anticipating a good laugh is good for your health .
When stressed out , the body constricts blood vessels , elevates the production of potentially damaging stress hormones , and raises blood pressure .
Short periods of stress are normal and not dangerous , but over long periods of time stress weakens the immune system and makes heart problems more likely .
In 2005 researchers found that laughing lowers blood pressure , but the biochemical mechanism within the body remained unclear .
Now Lee Berk at Loma Linda University in California and his colleagues have revealed part of the answer .
He who laughs first
Back in 2006 , Berk and his colleagues found that merely anticipating laughter boosted the production of mood - elevating hormones called β- endorphins and the immunity - enhancing human growth hormone by 27 % and 87 % , respectively .
This led the team to wonder whether the link between lowered blood pressure and laughter could be the result of laughter somehow interfering with the production of stress hormones .
To test this , they worked with a group 16 men .
Half were told that they were going to watch a humorous video that they themselves had selected earlier ; the other half were told that they were going to sit in a room with magazines .
The researchers monitored the men for levels of the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline , and for dihydroxyphenylacetic acid ( DOPAC ) — a metabolite of dopamine that helps to produce adrenaline — throughout the experiment .
Berk and his team report today at the 121st Annual Meeting of the American Physiological Society in San Diego , California , that levels of all three stress chemicals decreased before , during and after the men viewed their videos .
Thirty minutes after the videos were watched , cortisol was down 67 % , adrenaline was down 35 % , and DOPAC was down 69 % .
But what really shocked the team was that cortisol , adrenaline and DOPAC decreased by 39 % , 70 % , and 38 % respectively before anything funny was seen .
“ It would seem that merely having a merry heart in anticipation of the happy experience lowered stress levels ... they dropped before videos were even watched ” says Berk .
No laughing matter
Berk and his team are serious about the study of laughter , because the potential applications are huge .
“ It ’s no joke , we need to start prescribing humour as medication ” says Berk .
Immune disorders are known to be exacerbated by stress , and if getting immune - disorder patients to anticipate happiness or laughter reduces concentrations of stress chemicals in the blood , then this therapy can only serve to help , explains Berk .

Stress hormones do a lot more than regulate the immune system , they contribute to many health - related issues such as depression , high blood pressure and control of diabetes , says Bruce Rabin , a pathologist and psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania .
“ Looks like my grandmother was right , laughter is the best medicine , ” Rabin adds .
The next step is to understand the biochemical pathways that allow communication between this humour region of the brain and the hormone - releasing section of the endocrine and immune systems .
Berk says he thinks that cytokines — the peptides that are produced by the immune system and regulate how it responds to outside agents and neurological activity — are the key .
“ We need to figure out which cytokines are doing what and how they are modulating in response to laughter ” says Berk .
We all should be very scared – very , very scared .
Beginning Saturday , those living on American soil are likely to suffer a " horrendous act . "
That 's what Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell told Americans on Friday .
The reason is that the Democratic - controlled House of Representatives wo n't re-authorize President Bush 's warrantless spying powers , which are expiring Saturday .
The Senate did days ago , and even agreed to immunize telecommunications companies from lawsuits for assisting the administration .
" More than likely we would miss the very information we need to prevent some horrendous act from taking place in the United States , " McConnell said .
President Bush has some bone chilling things to say as well .
After the House on Wednesday refused to follow the Senate 's footsteps and re-authorize the Protect America Act , which sunsets Saturday , the chief executive said Americans ' lives were hanging in the balance .
" At this moment , somewhere in the world terrorists are planning new attacks on our country , " the president said .
" Their goal is to bring destruction to our shores that will make Sept. 11 pale by comparison . "
And on Friday , hours before the Protect America Act expires , Bush reiterated the point .
" By blocking this piece of legislation , our country is more in danger of an attack , " he said .
The verbiage from McConnell , Bush and a string of Republican lawmakers is , to say the least , frightening .
The words are scary because they portend the end of civilization , as we know it .
Has Nancy Pelosi , the House speaker from San Francisco , doomed us all ?
Pelosi countered that the president was " misrepresenting the facts on our nation 's electronic surveillance capabilities . "
Illinois Rep. Rahm Emanuel , who heads the House Democratic Caucus , said Friday that " This is not about protecting Americans .
The president just wants to protect American telephone companies . "
But what if Pelosi , Emanuel and other Democrats are wrong ?
What if Bush and company are telling the truth ?
What if it is n't fear mongering ?
The Bush believers , however , are not flocking across the border .
Do they not believe him ?
With the nation on the brink of destruction with Saturday 's deadline looming , many Republican and Democratic lawmakers have left Washington and returned to their home districts for a 12 - day Presidents '
Day recess .
Perhaps the headlines of the pending apocalypse are simply headlines – a regurgitation of post 9 - 11 political theater , and devoid of any real meaning to those who bother to read them .
At bottom , the debate is whether the nation 's intelligence - gathering agencies need warrants – from a secret court – to snoop on suspected terrorists via telecommunication facilities within the United States .
Starting on Saturday , the law brokered last year authorizing warrantless searches expires .
But such warrantless spying has already occurred in a program the Bush administration authorized following the Sept. 11 attacks .
The president , as chief commander , maintains the Constitution grants him such powers notwithstanding the Fourth Amendment .
We all should be very scared – very , very scared .

Women who are forever urging their other halves to help more around the house may feel at times they are wasting their breath .
But they should persevere - because experts have declared that nagging does work .
Research shows that the sort of mental exhaustion produced by a constant stream of questions or orders leaves us open to persuasion .
In other words , nagging leaves us too tired to resist .
This is one of eight pieces of advice gleaned from a host of studies carried out around the world on the science of persuasion .
Other tips on getting your own way include not hesitating when making your pitch , not giving too many choices and meeting face to face , New Scientist magazine reports .
Studies show people are more likely to do what is being asked if their mental reserves are low .
In one experiment , U. S. researchers tried to persuade a group of students to agree to one month 's summer holiday instead of three .
Half the students came to the study fresh , while the others had just completed a task which required them to write down all the thoughts that came into their heads while suppressing thoughts of a bear that had been mentioned by the researchers .
Those who did the mentally - draining task were more willing to give up two months of holiday .
New Scientist advises : ' You should avoid engaging in argument or doing battle with sales people when your mental batteries are running low .
Conversely , if you are trying to be persuasive , strike when you 're target is running low on mental energy .
' Of course , there is a form of mental exhaustion that does n't require thought : nag them into submission . '
Another way to get what you want is to make your case quickly but without pause or hesitation .
Research shows that ums and ahs make us sound less convincing .
Another tip is not to ask the object of your request for too much .
Studies have revealed that the more reasons people are asked to come up with in support of an idea , the less value they ascribe to each .
So one good reason is better than ten .
Flattery also helps you get your own way , as does mirroring the body language of the person you are trying to persuade .
If all else fails , you could try getting them angry - a strategy used by politicians and animal rights groups to make people sympathetic to their cause .
Boys at primary school perform ' significantly ' better in English tests if they are taught in classes with fewer girls , a new study claims .
Research from Bristol University , which used data from every state school in England , found that as the proportion of girls rose , the results achieved by their male classmates fell .
Steven Proud , who carried out the work , concluded it ' might be beneficial for boys to be educated in single - sex classes ' in English .
He argued that girls tended to be ahead of boys in English , and so were more likely to answer questions , raise their hands and behave confidently in lessons .
Boys studying alongside a large number of girls find it easier to ' hide in the background ' .
' There is some thought that it could be down to boys free - riding in English classes , ' said Proud , from the university 's centre for market and public organisation .
' The more girls there are , the less they need to work .
That is one supposition .
Since girls perform considerably better in English , if there are more girls in the class , they are more likely to volunteer answers , so boys can hide in the background and it still appears the class is doing well .
' The other possibility is that there is some link between the sex of the teacher and how they focus their teaching .
If a female teacher is teaching a lot of female pupils , they could focus their teaching towards girls and that could negatively effect the boys . '
In his working paper , Proud said the results implied ' that boys would benefit at all ages from being taught English in English schools with as small a proportion of girls as possible ' .
Mick Brookes , general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers , said that boys who were a minority in a class could ' feel swamped by the high - attaining girls ' .
' English is seen as a girly thing to do but that is wrong , ' he said .
' What schools have to do is look at the subject matter in English and if it appears to have a feminine bias , then they need to look at that and see how it can be changed . '
Parents , meanwhile , called for teachers to be trained in dealing with classes where there were gender imbalances .
Margaret Morrissey , of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations , said : ' I suspect that when there are fewer boys they are not going to feel as confident to put their hands up and are worried they will look silly if they get it wrong .
' There are lots of ways it can be dealt with and perhaps it is important to input this into teacher training . '
But some academics argued that more work needed to be done first .
Alan Smithers , professor of education at the University of Buckingham , said he thought Proud had highlighted a ' fascinating pattern ' .
' But we need to see what is producing it , ' he said .
Smithers argued that only 15 per cent of educational performance was due to the nature of the school and factors such as gender balance .
' Most of it is attributable to other factors , such as ability differences or home background differences .
' It is very interesting but we need to delve more deeply .
It would be wrong to rush to judgment . '
( CNN ) -- Geraldine Ferraro defended her controversial comment that Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign was successful because he was black , telling an interviewer Tuesday that she was being attacked because she was white .
Comments by former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro are drawing criticism from the Obama campaign .
" Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says , ' Let 's address reality and the problems we 're facing in this world , ' you 're accused of being racist , so you have to shut up , " she told the Daily Breeze of Torrance , California .
" Racism works in two different directions .
I really think they 're attacking me because I 'm white .
How 's that ? "
In another interview Tuesday , she compared Obama 's situation to her own 24 years ago , when she was the first female candidate for vice president .
She told a FOX News interviewer , " I got up and the question was asked , ' Why do you think Barack Obama is in the place he is today " as the party 's delegate front - runner ?
" I said in large measure , because he is black .
I said , Let me also say in 1984 -- and if I have said it once , I have said it 20 , 60 , 100 times -- in 1984 , if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro , I would never have been the nominee for vice president , " she said .
In her first interview with Daily Breeze , published late last week , Ferraro said , " If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position .
And if he was a woman , he would not be in this position .
He happens to be very lucky to be who he is .
And the country is caught up in the concept . "
She also said Hillary Clinton had been the victim of a " sexist media . "
Obama himself has called the comments " patently absurd . "
" I do n't think Geraldine Ferraro 's comments have any place in our politics or in the Democratic Party .
They are divisive , " he told the Allentown Morning Call .
" I think anybody who understands the history of this country knows they are patently absurd .
And I would expect that the same way those comments do n't have a place in my campaign , they should n't have a place in Sen.
Clinton's , either , " he added .
Earlier , Obama 's top strategist , David Axelrod , called for Clinton to sever ties with the former New York congresswoman , who serves on her campaign 's finance committee .
" When you wink and nod at offensive statements , you 're really sending a signal to your supporters that anything goes , " Axelrod said .
Axelrod said the comment by Ferraro , coupled with Clinton 's " own inexplicable unwillingness " to deny that Obama was a Muslim during a recent interview , was part of " an insidious pattern that needs to be addressed . "
Ferraro could not be reached for comment .
Clinton told The Associated Press that she did not agree with Ferraro 's comments .
" It is regrettable that any of our supporters on both sides , because we 've both had that experience , say things that kind of veer off into the personal , " she said .
" We ought to keep this on the issues .
There are differences between us .
There are differences between our approaches on health care , on energy , on our experience , on our results that we 've produced for people .
That 's what this campaign should be about . "
The former congresswoman is the latest Clinton surrogate to launch a firestorm with comments that related to Obama 's heritage or ethnicity .
Clinton 's husband , former President Clinton , drew sharp criticism from black leaders for a series of comments he made before the South Carolina primary , including comparing Obama 's campaign to the Rev. Jesse Jackson 's 1984 run .
Former Nebraska Sen . Bob Kerrey , a major Clinton backer , said several times that an Obama presidency would improve the world 's image of the U.S. because of the Illinois senator 's Muslim roots .
Obama , however , said Kerrey 's comments were intended to highlight Obama 's Muslim heritage in voters ' minds .
And shortly before the Texas primary , 84 - year - old Clinton supporter Adelfa Callejo told CBS 11 News in Dallas , Texas , that Obama would have trouble attracting Latino support because he was African - American .
" When blacks had the numbers , they did n't do anything to support us , " Callejo said .
" They always used our numbers to fulfill their goals and objectives , but they never really supported us , and there 's a lot of hard feelings about that .
I do n't think we 're going to get over it anytime soon . "
Last month , when Hillary Clinton was asked whether she would reject and denounce Callejo 's remarks , she said , " People get to express their opinions , " adding that " a lot of folks have said really unpleasant things about me over the course of this campaign . "
Later , her campaign released a statement saying that she had been unaware of the substance of the remarks during that interview and both denounced and rejected them .
Obama has faced his own headaches .
Foreign policy adviser Samantha Power ended her connection with his campaign last week after telling a Scottish interviewer that Clinton was a " monster . "
Power also made remarks about Obama 's Iraq war policy that were used by the Clinton campaign in recent attacks .

Newly declassified documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) from the Department of Defense ( DoD ) expose the role played by psychologists in the illegal interrogation of prisoners at CIA and Pentagon detention facilities in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
According to ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh ,
The documents reveal that psychologists and medical personnel played a key role in sustaining prisoner abuse — a clear violation of their ethical and legal obligations .
The documents only underscore the need for an independent investigation into responsibility for the systemic abuse of detainees held in U.S. custody abroad .
In 2006 , the civil liberties group received a highly redacted version of the Church Report , commissioned by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
Written by Vice Admiral Albert T. Church , the report was to serve as a “ comprehensive review ” of military interrogation operations in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay .
A cover -up the moment it saw the light of day , the Church Report refused to address the relevant issue of command responsibility for prisoner abuse and torture at U.S. military detention facilities and CIA “ black sites , ” claiming such questions were “ beyond its mandate . ”
Official failure to issue legal interrogation guidelines for the humane treatment of prisoners by American military forces and mercenary contractors in their employ were euphemistically labeled “ a missed opportunity . ”
But as we now know , under the torture regime given legal sanction by the Bush administration , as ABC News reported in April , medicalized torture by military psychologists operating in U.S. dungeons was both a ubiquitous and banal aspect of the “ war on terror . ”
According to the Church Report :
… analogous to the [ Behavioral Science Consultation Teams ] BSCT in Guantánamo Bay , the Army has a number of psychologists in operational positions ( in both Afghanistan and Iraq ) , mostly within Special Operations , where they provide direct support to military operations .
They do not function as mental health providers , and one of their core missions is to support interrogations .
[ emphasis added ]
Indeed , BSCT operatives at America ’s premier gulag , Guantánamo Bay , “ reversed - engineered ” Special Operations Command ’s Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ( SERE ) program as a means to destroy a prisoners ’ will to resist his captors demands to “ confess ” to all manner of “ plots , ” however far - fetched , against the U.S. “ homeland . ”
Following a script written during the CIA ’s MKULTRA “ mind control ” days , the KUBARK Counterintelligence Manual , vicious techniques of isolation , sensory deprivation , sexual and cultural humiliation , waterboarding , etc. were viciously applied by behavioral “ specialists . ”
As psychoanalyst Stephen Soldz wrote last year , citing the DoD ’s August 2006 report from the Office of the Inspector General ,
All evidence is that these SERE techniques continued to be used , with active participation of the BSCT psychologists .
For example , it is well documented ( see the interrogation log ) that the chair of the Guantánamo BSCT team , psychologist Major John Leso participated in the abusive interrogation ( a.k.a. torture ) of prisoner 063 , Mohammed al - Qahtani .
A July 14 , 2004 memo from the FBI to the Army Criminal Investigation Command documents the effects of this interrogation on al - Qatani : “ In September or October of 2002 FBI agents observed that a canine was used in an aggressive manner to intimidate detainee — after he had been subjected to intense isolation for over three months .
During that time period , … was totally isolated ( with the exception of occasional interrogations ) in a cell that was always flooded with light .
By late November , the detainee was evidencing behavior consistent with extreme psychological trauma ( talking to non-existent people , reporting hearing voices , crouching in the corner of a cell covered with a sheet for hours on end ) .
It is unknown to the FBI whether such extended isolation was approved by DoD authorities . ” …
With the release of the OIG ’s report , it is now irrefutable that both SERE psychologists and Guantánamo BSCT psychologists were involved in the development of these forms of interrogation abuse , forms of interrogation that clearly constitute psychological torture and were illegal under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , and various US laws until the 2006 Military Commissions
Act granted immunity to those who had previously broken these laws during the “ Global War On Terror . ”
The ACLU ’s latest tranche of documents also reveal that Army medics routinely failed to report the abuse of prisoners in Iraq .
According to the ACLU , citing the Church Report ,
“ enlisted medics witnessed obvious episodes of detainee abuse apparently without reporting them to superiors . ”
One episode involved a detainee whose wounded leg was intentionally hit .
Two others involved detainees handcuffed uncomfortably to beds for prolonged periods , such that one eventually suffered a dislocated shoulder and another experienced excruciating pain when eventually forced to stand .
Another incident involved a medic who witnessed pictures of naked detainees in a pyramid but did not report the episode to superiors .
Grimly , the report found that in three separate instances between November and June 2003 , three detainees were in all probability murdered by U.S. forces : at Abu Ghraib a prisoner died due to “ compromised respiration ” ; a prisoner at Forward Operating Base Tiger in Iraq , “ died of asphyxia during interrogation ” ; while a third detainee in Al Nasiriyah died of strangulation .
His ribs and neck bones had been broken .
The Church Report avers : “ the investigation suggests he was beaten and then dragged by the neck by a guard . ”
But in the post -Constitutional bizarro world of Bushist “ homeland security , ” guilt , innocence , or for that matter the security of the American people , are of no consequence .
What is important however , for the masters of the American deep state , is “ keeping the rabble in line ” by regular injections of psychological terror dispensed by administration shills and their “ message force multipliers , ” the corporate media .

SAN ANGELO , Texas ( CNN ) --
Texas officials had no right to remove about 460 children from a polygamist sect , the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday .
The Texas Supreme Court agreed with a lower court 's ruling , that the state 's Child Protective Services division did not present ample evidence that the children were being abused .
The state said it removed the children last month from the Yearning for Zion Ranch near Eldorado , Texas , because in interviews with those living there , officials found what they called a " pervasive pattern " of sexual abuse through forced marriages between underage girls and older men .
The high court ruling could clear the way for the children to be returned to their families .
The sect subscribes to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy .
" We are not inclined to disturb the court of appeals ' decision , " the ruling said .
" On the record before us , removal of the children was not warranted . "
Watch what the ruling may mean »
The court 's 6 - 3 ruling came in the case of 38 mothers who had appealed the removal of their children , but attorneys in the case have said the reasoning behind the court rulings can be applied to the removals of all the children from the ranch during the raid , which began April 3 .
About 460 children were removed , although 20 were found in court to be adults .
It 's unlikely the children will be returned to their homes soon , because it 's unclear which child belongs to which parent .
A DNA testing order by the district court is incomplete .
And even if the children do return to the YFZ Ranch , the case may not be over .
The justices noted that Texas law gives the district court " broad authority to protect children short of separating them from their parents and placing them in foster care . "
Examples of those conditions might be a court order saying a child must remain in a certain geographical area or an order removing an alleged perpetrator from the child 's home , the district court said .
An FLDS member applauded the Texas Supreme Court ruling Thursday .
" When we 'd given up hope on the system and we'd made a plea to every politician there is , it ends up being some kindhearted attorneys that were willing to take up this fight , " Willie Jessop said outside the courthouse in San Angelo after the ruling was issued .
" Put these families back .
There has been a catastrophic emotional and physical trauma to these families , permanent damage that will be left on them for a lifetime .
Two wrongs do not make a right , and the court has the ability to load these children up and return them . "
Watch Jessop urge that the children be returned »
He emphasized that the fellow FLDS members he knows do not allow their children to marry unless they are of age .
" I would like to call on [ Child Protective Services ] and the state of Texas to end this nightmare , " said Rod Parker , a Salt Lake City , Utah , attorney who has been a spokesman for FLDS families .
" It is time for the children to come home .
It is time for the state of Texas to lay down arms here and solve this problem . "
State officials have said the sect , with its polygamist beliefs , groomed young boys on the ranch to be abusers .
FLDS members deny any sexual abuse at the ranch and claim that they are being persecuted because of their religion .
The district court said in its ruling that CPS did not demonstrate that all the children on the ranch faced imminent danger , as necessary for their removal .
CPS said it will work to reunite children covered under the ruling with their parents .
" We are disappointed , but we understand and respect the court 's decision and will take immediate steps to comply , " a statement reads .
" Child Protective Services has one purpose in this case -- to protect the children .
Our goal is to reunite families whenever we can do so and make sure the children will be safe . "
CPS will continue working with the district court to make sure that the children remain safe and that the agency 's actions comply with the ruling .
In the Texas Supreme Court decision , the three dissenting justices said in an attached opinion that they agreed that the state had no right to remove the young boys from the ranch but that the district court did not err in electing to remove pubescent girls from the ranch and keep them in state custody .
The pubescent girls are " demonstrably endangered , " Justice Harriet O'Neill wrote .
FLDS leader and " prophet " Warren Jeffs , 52 , is in a Utah prison , serving two consecutive terms of five years to life after being convicted on two charges of being an accomplice to rape in connection with a marriage he performed in 2001 .
He also faces trial in Arizona on eight charges , including sexual conduct with a minor , incest and conspiracy .
Jeffs ' trial thrust the normally secretive FLDS into the national spotlight , and the raid on the YFZ Ranch last month intensified scrutiny on the sect .
In addition to the YFZ Ranch , the FLDS is prevalent in the twin border communities of Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona .
It was not immediately clear whether the Texas Supreme Court ruling would be appealed .
In theory , it could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin , but the court would be unlikely to weigh in because the case relates exclusively to Texas law .
Texas attorney Barbara Elias - Perciful supported the state in her filing .
She has been a guardian ad litem -- an attorney representing children 's interests -- in child protection cases for 16 years and is also the director of Texas Lawyers for Children .
" This case involves the systematic rape of minor children -- conduct that is institutionalized and euphemistically called ' spiritual marriage , ' " she wrote .
" Typically , there is no media coverage of the horrific acts sexual predators commit against children ... if the media showed the actual events of adult males demanding sex with 11 - year - old girls , there would be no one questioning the graphic danger of returning these children to their home at this time .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
Think your family going green wo n’t make a difference ?
Wrong , says a U.S. study released on Thursday that shows one household ditching paper statements for Web transactions would save 24 square feet of forest a year .
Icicles form on a mailbox in Kansas City , Kansas , December 11 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Dave Kaup
The PayItGreen Alliance said it believed this was the first detailed study commissioned to determine the impact of one individual household on the environment and it hoped to get across the message that every green step counted .
The study found the average U.S. household receives about 19 bills and statements from credit card companies and banks every month and makes about seven payments by paper each month .
By switching to electronic bills , statements and payments , the average American household would save 6.6 pounds of paper a year , save 0.08 trees , and not produce 171 pounds of greenhouse gases -- the equivalent of driving 169 miles .
The survey , whose results were vetted by the Environmental Protection Agency , said it would also mean avoiding the deforestation of 24 square feet of forest , the release of 63 gallons of wastewater into the environment , and save 4.5 gallons of gasoline used for mailing .
“ Individuals who think they are only one person and can’t really have an impact should re-evaluate their position .
Even small contributions can have a impact when aggregated , ” said Craig Vaream , a member of the PayItGreen Alliance and JPMorgan Chase .
JPMorgan Chase is one of about 16 members of the alliance which is made up of financial services companies and also includes Bank of America and the Federal Reserve Banks .
The alliance is lead by NACHA , the non-profit electronics payment association , that represents more than 11,000 financial institutions who are encouraging customers to conduct more transactions online .
The group was set up in 2007 to promote the positive environmental impact of choosing electronic payments , bills , and statements instead of paper .
It found that Americans each year mail 26 billion bills and statements and 9 billion payments in paper form with the related production and transportation consuming 755 million pounds of paper , 9 million trees , and 512 million gallons of gasoline .
The survey found that if 10 percent of U.S. households , or about 11.4 million households , gave up paper bills and statements the results would be significant .
It would save 75,469,808 pounds of paper , 905,638 trees , avoid producing 1.96 million pounds of greenhouse gases which was the equivalent of taking 162,861 cars off the road .
It would also preserve 6,202 acres of forest from deforestation , avoid creating 719,800,685 gallons of wastewater which is enough to fill 1,090 Olympic - size swimming pools , and avoid filling 3,071 garbage trucks with waste .
[ digg - reddit - me ] John Derbyshire of the National Review came out in support of Ron Paul today – and he makes a persuasive case .
The core of his argument is that a typical candidate will not be able to fix what is wrong :
Yet , more and more , I think we are heading for ( or perhaps are in ) some kind of systemic crisis , one that not even the meanest s.o.b. could do much about .
A systemic crisis needs a systemic solution , and only Paul offers that , with his return to constitutional fundamentals …
If , however , you think that much of the underbrush that has grown up around our national institutions this past 40 years needs to by pulled up by the roots and burned , before it chokes the life out of our Republic , then Paul ’s your man .
This is the only argument that could persuade me to support a Ron Paul , or even a Dennis Kucinich .
I too believe , along with Derbyshire , we are in the midst of a systematic crisis that has been developing since the presidency of Harry Truman at latest .
I also believe that George W. Bush has accelerated this crisis immeasurably – to Bush ’s credit .
If it were not for the boundless arrogance and incompetence Bush has displayed repeatedly throughout his term , we would n’t have the same opportunity for reform that we have now .
The many presidents who have made relatively responsible use of their power distracted the majority of Americans from the inherent systematic problems , and from the extra-constitutionality of the executive ’s growing power .
George W. Bush put these issues back on the agenda .
And it is the reality of George W. Bush , more than anything , that is fueling the candidacy of Ron Paul .
Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich are idealists rather than pragmatists .
They have big ideas that inspire and they are uncompromising in their goals .
Their dreams for America are pristine – and untouched by either politics or reality .
But there is a simple reason that I cannot support a Ron Paul or a Dennis Kucinich – even if I believed that either one perfectly expressed where we need to end up as a nation , and even if I believed either Paul or Kucinich would be able to accomplish their goals and overcome the tremendous obstacles in their way .
The simple reason is that radical change is rarely permanent and rarely good .
We are still dealing with the backlash from our first ideologically radical president , George W. Bush .
By changing so much so fast Bush has created a backlash against everything he has done .
This backlash looks a lot like Ron Paul – the opposite of Bush on many , many issues .
If someone was able to merge the persons of Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul , they would be able to create an almost perfect anti-Bush who opposed the current president on every issue and whose every inclination tended the opposite way of the current cowboy in chief .
But this is not enough – in fact , this politics of negation is precisely the opposite of what will solve America ’s problems .
What America needs today is a president who will focus on restoring the processes and institutions that make America safe and that preserve liberty and the American way of life .
We need a president who will be pragmatic and gradually win the support of the people for the long - term process that it will be to restore the Constitution and the system of checks and balances .
Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich do not seem to have a long - term strategy for their goals , even if their principles are correct – rather they claim they are just going to accomplish their objectives .
( ( I know Kucinich has detailed plans , and I ’m sure that Ron Paul has thought about these issues as well ; but they both seem to believe that the major impediment to radical change is their own election .
Governing is not so easy of a proposition , especially with entrenched interests defending each and every aspect of the system . )
I do n’t think the world works this way .
More , I believe , if either of these men were faced with having to implement their agendas , they would begin hedging so fast and so furiously , they would make Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton look principled .
I do n’t mean this as a slight to either man .
I believe both are intelligent enough to realize how difficult it would be to dismantle the IRS or create a single - payer health care system ; and when faced with the prospect of having to accomplish these goals , they would naturally hedge their promises if not their principles .
Politics is the art of compromise – and a practice where ideals are hard to reconcile with power .
As I have said before : this is why I support Barack Obama .
Because I believe he is principled , yet pragmatic .
I see in him both the arrogance and ambition needed to run for president , and the humility to see that the tasks before him are far greater than he can accomplish by himself .
He is a political figure who transcends traditional political boundaries .
Most important , he believes that process is paramount and is willing to base his campaign on bringing people together to fix the many broken processes that form the bedrock of a robust democracy .
Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich are likely good men with admirable goals ; and it is their unflinching idealism which attracts so many .
But it is precisely this which would cause them to fail and to create a backlash of the same sort that Bush has created with his policies .
Perhaps this is n’t the most inspiring campaign slogan , but I think it ’s appropriate :
Barack Obama :
All the change we can handle , and judgment we can trust .
Political courage is not only measured by the worthiness of one ’s ideals , but by the sum of one ’s actions .

BBC | A top aide to former Secretary of State Colin Powell has launched a stinging attack on US Vice - President Dick Cheney over abuse of prisoners by US troops .
Col Lawrence Wilkerson accused Mr Cheney of ignoring a decision by President Bush on the treatment of prisoners in the war on terror .
Asked by the BBC ’s Today if Mr Cheney could be accused of war crimes , he said : “ It ’s an interesting question . ”
“ Certainly it is a domestic crime to advocate terror , ” he added .
“ And I would suspect , for whatever it ’s worth , it ’s an international crime as well . ”
This is an extraordinary attack by a man who until earlier in the year was Mr Cheney ’s colleague in the senior reaches of the Bush team , the BBC ’s Justin Webb in Washington says .
Col Wilkerson has in the past accused the vice - president of responsibility for the conditions which led to the abuse of prisoners .
But this time he has gone much further , appearing to suggest Mr Cheney should face war crimes charges , our correspondent adds .
Intelligence questions
He said that there were two sides of the debate within the Bush administration over the treatment of prisoners .
Mr Powell and more dovish members had argued for sticking to the Geneva conventions , which prohibit the torture of detainees .
Dick Cheney has been accused of advocating the use of terror
Meanwhile , the other side “ essentially wanted to do away with all restrictions ” .
Mr Bush agreed a compromise , that “ Geneva would in fact govern all but al - Qaeda and al - Qaeda look - alike detainees ” .
“ What I ’m saying is that , under the vice - president ’s protection , the secretary of defence [ Donald Rumsfeld ] moved out to do what they wanted in the first place , even though the president had made a decision that was clearly a compromise , ” Col Wilkerson said .
He said that he laid the blame on the issue of prisoner abuse and post - war planning for Iraq “ pretty fairly and squarely ” at Mr Cheney ’s feet .
“ I look at the relationship between Mr Cheney and Mr Rumsfeld as being one that produced these two failures in particular , and I see that the president is not holding either of them accountable … so I have to lay some blame at his feet too , ” he went on .
In the BBC interview , Col Wilkerson also developed his views on whether or not pre-war intelligence was deliberately misused by the White House .
He said that he had previously thought only honest mistakes were made .
But recent revelations about doubts in the intelligence community that appear to have been suppressed in the run-up to the war have made him question this view .
The past 10 years have been a rollercoaster for energy markets with the price of oil swinging from $ 10 ( £ 5 ) a barrel to nearly $ 120 , triggering demands to explore in areas formerly written off as too expensive or too environmentally sensitive such as Canada 's tar sands and the Arctic .
The ratcheting up in the cost of oil and gas should have driven up inflation and led to a switch to alternative fuel sources .
Instead , oil companies have recorded the highest ever profits in corporate history as demand continues to outstrip supply .
In the process , the industry has reconsidered its strategy to plan for an era of high prices .
It was completely different 10 years ago when Opec , the oil producers ' cartel , raised output in reaction to a swift increase in prices , just as Asia was plunged into a currency crisis .
The price of crude tumbled to $ 10 a barrel and such was the gloom about the future that it was not long before one well respected magazine - The Economist - was predicting that oil prices could in future be halved to $ 5 a barrel .
The near bust in commodity prices saw a transformation in the structure of the world 's largest oil groups such as BP , ExxonMobil and Total as they took advantage of the downturn to go on the acquisition trail .
The slump encouraged technological innovation with companies using 3 - D seismic data to reduce drilling risk , directional and horizontal drilling , plus the injection of carbon dioxide and other measures to improve reservoir recovery .
By 2000 , oil prices had recovered to $ 30 but even an industry veteran such as Sir Mark Moody - Stuart , then chairman of Shell , was pessimistic about the longer - term direction of crude values , insisting his company would use $ 14 as a future guide .
" In the longer term , technology will increase production capacity and tend to drive the oil price somewhere below $ 20 a barrel , " he said that October .
Towards the end of the following year , prices had indeed dipped again , hit this time by a combination of increased Opec output , a big recovery in Russian production and weakness in the US economy .
The 2003 invasion of Iraq by US and British forces caused a price rise and uncertainty in other petroleum producing parts of the world such as Venezuela and Nigeria kept pushing them further .
In October 2004 , crude values had reached $ 50 a barrel and industry analysts began to note the soaring demand from China as it embarked on its most rapid industrialisation process .
Within six months , the Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs invited ridicule by suggesting the world would see a " super - spike of $ 105 a barrel " .
It explained : " We believe oil markets may have entered the early stages of what we have referred to as a ' super spike ' - a multi - year trading band of oil prices high enough to meaningfully reduce energy consumption and recreate a spare capacity cushion only after which will lower energy prices return . "
In September 2005 , prices rose above $ 60 a barrel after Hurricane Katrina damaged oil production facilities in the US .
The market increased again to $ 66 a barrel in January 2006 as a result of violence in Nigeria and Iran 's conflict with the west , before reaching a new peak in August when oil rose to $ 75 a barrel after Israel invaded Lebanon .
Over the past 12 months the price of oil has almost doubled to nearly $ 120 .
Different reasons have been put forward to explain the rises - from tensions between Washington and Iran , worries about " peak oil " , insufficient refinery capacity and under- production by Opec .
Certainly , many hedge funds have turned to commodities as equity values have slumped and financial buyers are purchasing crude as a hedge against further falls in the dollar .
The new world of $ 100 - plus oil has encouraged all the big companies to raise the level at which they are prepared to invest in new oilfields and prompted them to re-examine areas previously considered too expensive given the likely size of any find - such as the North Sea .
Canada 's tar sands - where oil is extracted in an energy - intensive way - has seen a new Klondyke rush with Shell and BP both moving in .
Similarly , oil companies have started to talk openly about the potential that exists beneath the Arctic , despite pressure from environmental groups .
The western oil companies have found host nations such as Venezuela and Russia gradually seizing back assets while state - owned oil groups from China and India prowl the world for new supplies .
The growth in the need for oil - particularly in China and India - has led to shortages of rigs and drilling staff .
Inflation might have remained relatively muted so far , but costs in the oil sector are surging at 15 % a year in some areas .
The boom has extended to the service companies that provide all the equipment needed by the oil groups .
Having been at the sharp end of downward cost pressures from the larger oil and gas firms in the 1990s , which saw some driven out of business , they have found themselves in the driving seat as demand escalated dramatically .
Oil companies are being forced to pay more than $ 500,000 a day for deep - sea drilling rigs and service companies have become targets for takeover by private equity firms .
Expro International , a Reading - based well - testing specialist , has just received a £ 1.6 bn takeover offer from Candover in partnership with Goldman Sachs .
Today , she says , she is a new person , one who “ can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere ” on command and be “ one with all that is . ”
To her it is not faith , but science .
She brings a deep personal understanding to something she long studied : that the two lobes of the brain have very different personalities .
Generally , the left brain gives us context , ego , time , logic .
The right brain gives us creativity and empathy .
For most English - speakers , the left brain , which processes language , is dominant .
Dr. Taylor ’s insight is that it does n’t have to be so .
Her message , that people can choose to live a more peaceful , spiritual life by sidestepping their left brain , has resonated widely .
In February , Dr. Taylor spoke at the Technology , Entertainment , Design conference ( known as TED ) , the annual forum for presenting innovative scientific ideas .
The result was electric .
After her 18 - minute address was posted as a video on TED ’s Web site , she become a mini-celebrity .
More than two million viewers have watched her talk , and about 20,000 more a day continue to do so .
An interview with her was also posted on Oprah Winfrey ’s Web site , and she was chosen as one of Time magazine ’s 100 most influential people in the world for 2008 .
She also receives more than 100 e-mail messages a day from fans .
Some are brain scientists , who are fascinated that one of their own has had a stroke and can now come back and translate the experience in terms they can use .
Some are stroke victims or their caregivers who want to share their stories and thank her for her openness .
But many reaching out are spiritual seekers , particularly Buddhists and meditation practitioners , who say her experience confirms their belief that there is an attainable state of joy .

[ reddit - me ] Terry McAuliffe of the Clinton campaign on Meet the Press this morning described Barack Obama ’s campaign as one of “ gaming the system ” which is something he says Senator Hillary Clinton would never stoop to :
Listen , we have played hard and we did n’t want to game the system .
The statement is one that does n’t ring true on several levels and is certainly an odd way to describe the Obama campaign – and an odd way to excuse the total lack of preparation or foresight that has characterized the Clinton campaign .
I do n’t mean to use the phrases “ lack of preparation ” and “ lack of foresight ” as weapons here – but as objective descriptions of the campaign .
Her campaign simply assumed she was going to sweep the early primaries and even now still lags behind the Obama campaign in organization in the remaining states , months after the nature of this campaign became clear .
Yet McAuliffe used the phrase “ gaming the system ” to describe the Obama campaign winning by every available measure – the popular vote count , the number of contests won , and especially the delegate count .
Gaming the system has been defined as “ using the rules , policies and procedures of a system against itself for purposes outside what these rules were intended for . ”
By implication , Obama – by playing by the rules , and winning – is using the rules against the Democratic party itself .
This whole reading makes sense , of course , only if the Clintons are the Democratic party .
McAuliffe ’s comments also called to mind the Susan Faludi piece in the New York Times a few days ago in which she described the appeal of Ms. Clinton ’s campaign :
… our first major female presidential candidate is n’t doing what men always accuse women of doing .
She ’s not summoning the rules committee over every infraction .
( Her attempt to rewrite the rules for Michigan and Florida are less a timeout than rough play . )
Not once has she demanded that the umpire stop the fight .
Indeed , she ’s asking for more unregulated action …
Faludi insightfully , and perhaps even accurately , described the gender and competition - related stereotypes at play – and how these stereotypes which were once used against Ms. Clinton are now working in her favor :
Maybe the white male electorate just can’t abide strong women whom they suspect of being of a certain sort .
To adopt a particularly lamentable white male construct , the sports metaphor , political strength comes in two varieties : the power of the umpire , who controls the game by application of the rules but who never gets hit ; and the power of the participant , who has no rules except to hit hard , not complain , bounce back and endeavor to prevail in the end .
For virtually all of American political history , the strong female contestant has been cast not as the player but the rules keeper , the purse - lipped killjoy who passes strait - laced judgment on feral boy fun .
The animosity toward the rules keeper is fueled by the suspicion that she ( and in American life , the regulator is inevitably coded feminine , whatever his or her sex ) is the agent of people so privileged that they do n’t need to fight , people who can dominate more decisively when the rules are decorous .
American political misogyny is inflamed by anger at this clucking overclass : who are they to do battle by imposing rectitude instead of by actually doing battle ?
The specter of the prissy hall monitor is , in part , the legacy of the great female reformers of Victorian America … .
While the populace might concede the merits of the female reformers ’ cause , it found them repellent on a more glandular level .
In that visceral subbasement of the national imagination — the one that underlies all the blood - and - guts sports imagery our culture holds so dear — the laurels go to the slugger who ignores the censors , the outrider who navigates the frontier without a chaperone .
I think this helps explain why the figure of “ Hillary the bare - knuckle brawler ” is so much more attractive than “ Hillary , the inevitable ” , or indeed , many of the other “ Hillary Clintons ” .
It helps her to play against type – including certain elements of her own reputation .

A Thin -Film Solar Panel Installation
May 24th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Many people envision solar power as rigid silicon panels mounted on a roof .
With thin film solar cells , you ’re more likely to not see them , or even know they ’re there .
This article is about a real - life thin film solar project .
Not many bloggers are able to witness the technologies we research and write about .
It ’s one thing to be able to buy afford a cool “ green ” gadget ( usually not very green ) , but another to see the many forms of solar , wind , geothermal , etc. , which are always changing and developing around the world .
So when my employer decided to go solar , you might imagine my excitement .
At the moment I work for Magco Inc. , a Tecta America company .
Tecta is a national commercial roofing corporation that can install green roofs , solar lighting , and solar panels alongside a variety of traditional roofing systems .
This solar project is pretty straight forward : our building has a big , flat roof on top of a hill without any shade .
You ’d have trouble finding a sunnier spot for solar panels .
I was double delighted when I heard that they ordered thin - film solar !
Naturally inquiring minds wanted to know : why and what kind ?
Magco bought their solar from Uni-Solar , which produces triple - junction laminate panels .
That means they laminate the photovoltaic chemicals onto a thin sheet of metal in three layers ; each layer reacts to a different range of light .
They also laminate a sealant on the panel to protect it from the elements .
The benefit of this system is that it reacts better to low or indirect light .
Think cloudy days and the hours around dusk and dawn , a .
Uni-Solar ’s panels operate around 12 % efficiency , but they claim to out - perform other forms of PV solar in indirect light , which means they could produce more electricity in certain real - world conditions ( cloudy days ) .
The laminate production method also decreases cost because expensive silicon and mounting racks are not required .
In fact , these thin - film solar panels are glued straight onto the roof .
( See picture . )
Magco chose these panels for another important reason : no roof penetrations .
If you mount racks on your roof , you have to fasten them down .
That means punching holes in the roof , which can void your warranty and even damage your roof if it ’s not done right .
Some solar systems , even silicon panels , have found ways to avoid these problems , and anyone looking into solar should ask about the integrity of their existing roof .
Another bonus for Magco and thin - film solar was weight : these solar panels roll out like carpet and do n’t weigh as much as silicon .
That means Magco would n’t need to add any structural support .
It does snow here , so weight is an important factor !
What about the electrical aspect ?
Special runners help connect and protect wires between panels and represent the only mounted equipment in the system .
The wires eventually find their way to a big inverter inside the building , which feeds the electricity to us .
A 2 - way power meter can then feed any excess electricity back into the grid .
Simple , right ?
Well , for a project this big and complicated you ’d definitely want to hire some professionals .
If you mix up which - wires - go - where , you could make some very expensive mistakes or just rob yourself of some of your solar power .
What if you and your neighbors want to go solar but ca n’t afford it ?
Bulk your order and get it done at the same time .
Combining your orders will reduce costs in man-hours and equipment ( think crane rentals ) .
Naturally you can also get a better deal on the panels themselves if you buy in larger quantity .

A social networking site has deleted most of its users over the age of 36 because it claims older users pose a danger of sex offending .
It claims to be forced into the action by the Government , but the part of a law it cites is not yet in force .
Faceparty has deleted what it describes as " a huge number of accounts " from its social networking site in recent weeks .
It lists ' over 36 years old ' as one of its reasons for deletion .
" We understand that only a minority of older users are sex offenders , but you must understand that we cannot tell which , " it says in its explanation of the deletion of accounts .
" New government legislation means we need to check older users on the sex offenders list , " says its notice .
" This legislation is based upon checking email addresses against a government provided list .
Faceparty has never insisted on validated email addresses and can therefore not participate in this new scheme . "
A new law was passed earlier this month , the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act , which contains provisions for the Secretary of State to require sex offenders to register their email addresses or other information .
That , though , is not currently part of the law and would require a ministerial order to become law .
The law makes no reference to the age of offenders .
Neither that law nor any other suggests that people over the age of 36 are more likely to be sex offenders .
" Having discussed the use of our website with the home office and the police , and further some pretty serious crimes caused by older users , we were left with no option but to terminate a huge amount of accounts , and without notice , immediately , " says the notice .
Faceparty has defended itself against accusations that it is simply trying to create a younger , more valuable user base for itself .
" Despite malicious rumours spread by a few people on the website , it is not true that we have deleted members due to ' ageism ' , " its notice said .
Faceparty did not respond to a request for comment .
It did say in its notice , though , that the site did have a serious problem with sex offenders .
It said that accounts were deleted without notice " because a gang of paedophiles had arrived on the website and had carried out a series of attacks on younger users " .
The Government has proposed a system which bears some similarity to that described by Faceparty .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has suggested a future system involving sex offenders registering their email addresses with the Government .
That list would then be made available to social networking sites who could check their users against it in order to help prevent offenders using the networks to contact potential victims .
One part of the new Criminal Justice and Immigration Act allows a Secretary of State to increase the notification requirements of sex offenders .
Offenders can already be required to notify details such as their name , address and national insurance number to their local police station .
Those notification requirements could include a person 's email address , their passport number , and notice of any foreign travel , the Home Office said in a review ( pdf ) of child protection online from 2007 .
A spokeswoman for the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre , a Government - backed centre , said that trying to ban users older than 36 may not be very effective in combating child abuse .
" It 's pretty easy to lie about your age , " she said .
" One of the things we 'd like to see all sites do is adopt a Report Abuse mechanism .
We think social networking sites are fantastic but providers have a duty of care to children .
Children should be able to use these environments but make it easy for them to report abuse . "
The Criminal Justice and Immigration
Act also made it an offence to possess extreme pornography , a move which had attracted objections from some civil liberties campaigners .
That part of the Act is not yet in force .

President Bush opposes a new G.I. Bill of Rights .
He worries that if the traditional path to college for service members since World War II is improved and expanded for the post - 9/11 generation , too many people will take it .
He is wrong , but at least he is consistent .
Having saddled the military with a botched , unwinnable war , having squandered soldiers ’ lives and failed them in so many ways , the commander in chief now resists giving the troops a chance at better futures out of uniform .
He does this on the ground that the bill is too generous and may discourage re-enlistment , further weakening the military he has done so much to break .
So lavish with other people ’s sacrifices , so reckless in pouring the national treasure into the sandy pit of Iraq , Mr. Bush remains as cheap as ever when it comes to helping people at home .
Thankfully , the new G.I. Bill has strong bipartisan support in Congress .
The House passed it by a veto - proof margin this month , and last week the Senate followed suit , approving it as part of a military financing bill for Iraq and Afghanistan .
Has anyone ever told you that you looked sad or tired when you were n’t ?
If the problem is n’t your mood , it might be your face , according to a study in the medical journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery .
Yale University researchers set out to determine how facial features like eyebrow shape , eyelids and wrinkles affect facial expressions .
They took a photo of a woman ’s eyes and digitally altered it to change the eyebrow or lid shape or add wrinkles .
After producing 16 different versions of the same face , they asked 20 study participants to rate , on a scale of 0 to 5 , the presence of seven expressions or emotions : tiredness , happiness , surprise , anger , sadness , disgust and fear .
What was surprising about the study is that many of the pictures that mimicked various plastic surgery procedures , such as eyelid surgery or brow lifts , actually generated worse scores , with study participants rating those faces as looking angry or tired .
For instance , drooping of the upper eyelid was the biggest indicator of tiredness , but a picture that simulated a type of eyelid surgery — involving the removal of excess skin from the upper eyelid — made the woman look even more tired and sad , the study participants reported .
Raising the upper eyelids produced an increase in the perception of surprise and fear .
“ A significant number of plastic surgery patients opt for eyelid surgery , forehead lifts and face - lifts not only for rejuvenative reasons , but to change an unattractive facial expression as well , ” said Dr. John A. Persing , one of the study authors .
“ Our findings indicate that moderation is best when removing excess skin in the upper eyelid .
You do not want to create an overdone look that actually makes you look more tired . ”
Eyebrows made a big difference in how people perceived the mood of the woman in the picture .
When the brows were lowered or slanted toward the nose , or when forehead wrinkles were added , ratings of anger and disgust increased .
Also , raising the outer corner of the eyebrows produced an increase in the perception of surprise .
Raising the inner corner of the eyebrows away from the nose was perceived as a sad facial expression .
According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons , more than 241,000 eyelid surgeries , 43,000 forehead lifts and 118,400 face - lifts were performed in 2007 .
But the study shows that people contemplating eye surgery should talk to their doctor about how a procedure might affect their facial expressions .
And some people might want to think twice about eliminating some sets of wrinkles .
One digitally - altered picture added crows ’ feet — tiny wrinkles around the eyes — and received high ratings for “ happiness . ”
“ The eyes and their related structures nonverbally communicate a wide range of expressions that are universal to all people , ” Dr. Persing said .
“ Therefore facial expression should be a factor in how patients and their plastic surgeons select various rejuvenation procedures .
As our findings show , even the slightest modification can elicit profound changes in how others perceive us . ”

People who score high on intelligence tests are also good at keeping time , new Swedish research shows .
The team that carried out the study also suspect that accuracy in timing is important to the brain processes responsible for problem solving and reasoning .
Researchers at the medical university Karolinska Institutet and Umeå University have now demonstrated a correlation between general intelligence and the ability to tap out a simple regular rhythm .
They stress that the task subjects performed had nothing to do with any musical rhythmic sense but simply measured the capacity for rhythmic accuracy .
Those who scored highest on intelligence tests also had least variation in the regular rhythm they tapped out in the experiment .
" It 's interesting as the task did n't involve any kind of problem solving , " says Fredrik Ullén at Karolinska Institutet , who led the study with Guy Madison at Umeå University .
" Irregularity of timing probably arises at a more fundamental biological level owing to a kind of noise in brain activity . "
According to Fredrik Ullén , the results suggest that the rhythmic accuracy in brain activity observable when the person just maintains a steady beat is also important to the problem - solving capacity that is measured with intelligence tests .
" We know that accuracy at millisecond level in neuronal activity is critical to information processing and learning processes , " he says .
They also demonstrated a correlation between high intelligence , a good ability to keep time , and a high volume of white matter in the parts of the brain 's frontal lobes involved in problem solving , planning and managing time .
" All in all , this suggests that a factor of what we call intelligence has a biological basis in the number of nerve fibres in the prefrontal lobe and the stability of neuronal activity that this provides , " says Fredrik Ullén .

But NSW Police Minister David Campbell says he wo n't hold off any longer because the public expects action .
The government has spent more than $ 1 million on 229 new Tasers , and 2000 police across NSW will be trained to use them , before they are put in the field at the end of this year .
The decision to roll out the weapons has been taken without waiting for the publication of NSW Ombudsman Bruce Barbour 's report into the controversial devices .
After several months in preparation , it is due in six to eight weeks time .
" The reason the government 's made this decision ( to introduce Tasers ) is that government 's are elected to make decisions , " Mr Campbell said today .
" I received advice from the ( police ) commissioner , from operational police , that these devices would be useful .
" The government is about making decisions not necessarily about sitting around waiting for reports . "
The ombudsman 's report would examine Taser training and safety issues , police operational procedures and the effects of stun guns on individuals , as well as fatal cases from around the world , a spokeswoman said .
A range of agencies , including police from across Australia and overseas contributed to the report , she said .
Mr Campbell has said every Taser would have an in - built video camera with up to 90 minutes of footage in order to hold officers accountable .
Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione yesterday said Tasers were a " less than lethal option " that would aid frontline police in dealing with difficult situations often fuelled by drugs and alcohol .
The new weapons mark the first time general duties police will use stun guns , with the 50 devices currently in use in NSW restricted to specialist commands , including the Tactical Operations Unit and the Riot Squad .
Mr Scipione has defended the safety of the weapons .
" ( Tasers ) do not affect the heart or other vital organs - that we know .
That is what the research tells us , " Mr Scipione said .
" The Taser in itself is not likely to cause anyone to die . "
There would be some cases where Tasers would not be used , for example on a pregnant woman .
However , children under the age of 18 could still be shot with one , he said .

Cha ndra M ultiwavelength Plane Survey Measuring the X - Ray Binary and Stellar Content of the Galaxy The Chandra Multiwavelength Plane ( ChaMPlane ) Survey is a project to identify a large sample of serendipitous X - ray sources located to arcsec precision in deep ~> 20 ksec ) galactic plane fields ( |b| ~< 10 degree ) imaged by the Chandra X-ray Observatory .
These sources include cataclysmic variables ( CVs ) , quiescent low mass X - ray binaries ( qLMXBs : which includes both black hole and neutron star systems ) ,
Be X - ray binaries and stellar coronal sources ( see Grindlay et al. ( 2005 ) for general description ) .
The primary science objective of this project is to measure , or constrain , the luminosity functions of compact X - ray binaries and CVs .
The ChaMPlane project is currently supported by NASA ( Chandra Archive ) , NOAO , and NSF .
The figure is an optical Mosaic image of field centered on the black hole X - ray nova GRO J0422+32 ( stacked 10 dithered R images ; total exposure time : 2100 sec ; North - left , west - up , FOV : 9'x9 ' ) .

Tax time !
I was successful in rounding up all but one of our W - 2 forms , so I ’ll be looking for the other and then getting down to work .
As I mentioned , I have a free copy of H&R Block ’s Tax Cut software which I think will be a good start .
However , I wo n’t be taking H&R Block or any other company up on their “ generous ” offers of refund anticipation loans or refund debit / credit cards .
I ’m not going to pay people money to get the money faster .
While this loan chart ( PDF ) is n’t very clear –that is , it does n’t have as much information as it should –it shows that getting a refund anticipation loan from H&R Block will cost you at least $ 30 , probably $ 50 + for a $ 200 refund .
They ’re unclear as to whether or not you need the “ bank check ” but it appears so .
Ok , so 1 / 4 of my tax refund would go to the account set - up fees ?
That ’s an awfully big slice of the pie .
But there ’s more .
The H&R Block prepaid Mastercard carries an ATM withdrawal charge .
If I only withdraw money once , and do it from the compatible ATMs , it ’ll just put me out $ 1.85 .
Of course , that ’s per-transaction .
So 10 transactions and I ’m out another $ 18.50 .
But that does n’t count transactions made at ATMs run by other banks , for maybe $ 2 - 3 per transaction .
Sure , that would happen anyway but it ’s a factor to consider .
My debit card does n’t charge me for withdrawals , so I only have to worry about the latter fee .
H&R Block customers have to worry about both .
If I say “ screw it all ” and decide to withdraw my money at a bank … that ’s a $ 20 charge .
Now once you get up to big refund amounts like $ 5000 , the percentage you ’re paying goes down .
But they have more time to nab your with ATM fees and the like .
Oh , and speaking of time , did I mention that the card will eventually expire ?
Yep .
So then they ’ll mail you a check for any remaining balance minus remaining fees .
One saving grace , this is definitely a prepaid debit card ( with all the hassles that brings ) and not a credit card .
Once the funds are gone , it stops working .
Anything else would have been a travesty — can you imagine ?
So those are my thoughts on the H&R Block program .
I like my money .
I ’m tired of the federal government having it .
If they ’re going to give it back I ’m sure as heck not giving a significant portion ( like more than 25 % if we ’re on the lower end of the scale !!! ) to someone else just so I can get it sooner .
No way no how .
This program is directed at two groups of people –those who ca n’t wait and those without bank accounts .
If you think you can’t wait , look at these fees and think again .
Maybe you truly can’t , but maybe you can if it ’ll mean that much more money .
If you do n’t have a bank account , carefully evaluate all these fees .
Will it really save you money on just getting the check cashed ?

Patrick of Cash Money Life also thinks refund anticipation loans suck .
He mentioned the Jackson Hewitt RALs , but apparently they did n’t have pricing online .
Shady ?
I think so .
This also reminded me of Gibble ’s post on delayed gratification .
It ’s certainly a case where waiting longer gets you more money !

I am told that a cathedral built by Purists is beautiful to behold , constructed lovingly of small bricks , no more than 50 lines per class , no more than 10 classes per package , no more than two instance variables per class , no more than one level of indentation per method , no more than one dot per line , and absolutely no else clauses .
def formatted_zip_code( digits )
ZipCodeDigitFactory.new(digits).to_formatted_string
end
class FourZipCodeDigits < BaseZipCodeDigits
def to_formatted_string
" 0#{self.to_s} "
end
end
This code reads pretty much as the author would have explained how to handle the “ digits ” variable :
If it only has four digits , pre-pend it with a zero .
If it only has three digits , prepend it with two zeros .
Simple and to the point and move on .
Save the clever code for something that matters .
The author of this code was an Agnostic .
He did n’t mind using a case statement instead of if - elsif - elsif , he paid attention to the features of his chosen programming language , but he did n’t have strong convictions about there being One True Way to express every set of choices .
His code “ Just Worked .
” The Agnostic ’s code carried on , quietly working , until one day another programmer chanced upon it .
Our second programmer was an Ascetic .
Ascetics believe in code that can do powerful things with a small set of core axioms , like recursion and first - class functions .
The Ascetic spotted a bug :
What if “ digits ” only had two digits ?
The objective of the code was clearly to have at least five digits , with leading zeros .
The Ascetic cracked his knuckles and went to work .
Given his favourite library function
He rewrote the Agnostic ’s code as : And all was well for a short time .
The Ascetic checked his code in , where another programmer , a Librarian , reviewed it .
She saw immediately that it could and should be re-written : Librarians believe that there is a library for everything , and good languages have huge libraries providing lots of built - in functionality .
Programming is the art of searching the libraries for the one magic incantation that does exactly what you want .
And for a short time , all continued to be well .
One day , management hired a senior programmer with much experience working in the bowels of BigCo .
He was brought in to provide “ Adult Supervision ” for the programming team .
He went right to work , reviewing the code base and compiling a list of sins against his religious convictions .
He was an OO Purist .
The Purist considered ifs , cases , and even shortcut booleans to be deficiencies in code , places where the proper approach — and indeed to only approach — is to use polymorphism and dependent types
The Purist seized upon the twice - rewritten code as an opportunity to show how such a thing ought to be written :
Alas , space does not permit me to show you all of the subclasses of Digits he composed , one for each possible length of string .
For example : I have also omitted his ZipCodeFactory that would take a normal string and figure out which particular subclass of BaseZipCodeDigits to construct .
( I am told that a cathedral built by Purists is beautiful to behold , constructed lovingly of small bricks , no more than 50 lines per class , no more than 10 classes per package , no more than two instance variables per class , no more than one level of indentation per method , no more than one dot per line , and absolutely no else clauses . )
Of course , the Librarian , Ascetic and the Purist hated each other with a passion fueled by the narcissism of small differences into a raging fire of religious cleansing .
Much politicking and fighting broke out over the code .
Meanwhile , the Agnostic carried on , quietly coding while the others bickered over how to properly rewrite what he would write .
One day , he noticed that some unit tests were failing and raised the issue in Campfire .
“ Hey , ” he asked , “ What happened to that piece of code ?
It was for zip codes , it was only supposed to pre-pend one or two zeros when importing zip codes from CSV files .
Anything with fewer than three digits is supposed to be an invalid code .
Empty strings should n’t be converted to five zeros , as far as I know .
” “ What ’s up with that ?
” The Librarian , Ascetic , and Purist were silent for a moment , and then immediately resumed arguing , this time over whether #rjust should have another parameter , whether the regular expression in a recursive routine should be changed , or whether the simplest thing was to simply change the method for the EmptyDigits , OneDigit , and TwoDigits classes .
The Agnostic listened for a moment , tried to interject a few times , then sighed and reached for his text editor .
Update : Reviewing the comments made elsewhere , I see that this post fell into the Fizzbuzz Trap :
By quoting a programming problem — no matter how banal and contrived — the article was bound to provoke a huge amount of dicussion around the correct way to solve the problem , while ignoring the point of the post .
This is my fault , I should have known better than to post a snippet of code .
As many of you have noted , the post is not about the Agnostic or his code , it ’s about the dynamic of programmers eager to rewrite code in their own image , and the hypothesis that our ( I am equally guilty of this behaviour ) motivation for doing so is to emphasize the small differences between ourselves and others .
For no matter how good or bad the Agnostic ’s code is , why did the Librarian rewrite the Ascetic ’s code ?
Why did the Purist rewrite it again ?
When they discovered that the Agnostic ’s code actually met some requirement , why were n’t they talking about documentation , or the process around tests ?
Why were they all — including the agnostic — eager to rewrite it one more time ?
Seriously , the post is not about whether the Agnostic should have documented his code , or where the zip code validation should live .
However , I should have known that the moment I included a piece of code to provide local colour , the resulting debate over its fitness was inevitable .

Wal - Mart Collapses
U.S. Cities and Towns by Richard Freeman
[ The charts referenced in this article are available to paid subscribers of Electronic Intelligence Weekly . ]
During the last 20 years , Wal - Mart has moved into communities and destroyed them , wiping out stores , slashing the tax base , and turning downtown areas into ghost - towns .
This is accomplished through Wal - Mart 's policy of paying workers below subsistence wages , and importing goods that have been produced under slave - labor conditions overseas .
Often , communities will even give Wal - Mart tax incentives , for the right to be destroyed .
Wal - Mart both reflects , and is , a major driving force for America 's deadly implementation of the Imperial Rome model .
Unable to produce physical goods to sustain its own existence , the United States , like Rome , sucks in imported goods from around the world , using , in this case , a dollar that is over - valued by 50 - 60 % .
America has been transformed from a producer to a consumer society .
From the 1940s through the early 1960s , through its technologically - advanced manufacturing - agricultural economy , America produced new value that contributed to mankind 's advancement .
Through a " post - industrial society " policy , the bankers have pushed Wal - Mart to the top of the heap , so that it is now the world 's largest corporation , with $ 245.5 billion in sales last year .
Wal - Mart , which produces no value - added whatsoever , dominates the geometry that governs the U.S. consumer society .
America consumes goods that others produce , which Wal - Mart markets .
Wal - Mart dictates , through its demand for low prices , that its suppliers outsource their production to foreign nations , further ripping down America 's battered domestic manufacturing and agricultural capability , in a self - feeding process .
Presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche has called for an international boycott of Wal - Mart .
He told a cadre school of the LaRouche Youth Movement on Nov. 10 : " Wal - Mart is probably one of the major foreign enemies of the United States !
And , it 's based in the United States .
Where Wal - Mart strides , whole communities collapse !
It runs in like a vampire :
It flies in by night , and sucks the blood of the citizens , and the cows , and so forth .
In the morning , there 's not much left !
Except unemployment and cheap labor .
What Wal - Mart is doing to many communities of the Americas , is comparable to what happens to the poor Chinese , who are victims of the cheap - labor programs , which supply most of the product which Wal - Mart sells , as cheap - labor product . "
Wal - Mart pays its American workers sweat - shop wages , and enforces a worldwide system of concentration camp production plants , where some workers are literally kept as indentured servants ( see EIR , Nov. 14 ) .
Here , we look at how Wal - Mart has laid waste communities from Iowa to Mississippi , from Ohio to Oklahoma .
Destroying Iowa Iowa represents the paradigm of Wal - Mart 's destruction of a state and its communities .
Iowa is a leading agricultural state , with an industrial center in its northeast .
In 1983 , Wal - Mart opened its first store in the state .
Since that time , the number of other retail stores that Wal - Mart has forced to close in Iowa , in communities of 5,000 or fewer people , is immense .
Sam Walton started Wal - Mart in his home town of Bentonville , Arkansas in 1962 .
At first he concentrated on Arkansas , Oklahoma , and Texas , along with a few other southern states .
Beginning in the 1980s , he spread Wal - Mart out as a national chain , shifting from discount stores with 40 - 70,000 square feet of sales space , to increasingly building Sam's Club and supercenters , which typically have 150 - 200,000 square feet .
The idea was to use its ability to sell a huge volume of goods , its sweat - shop pay to American workers , and its flood of cheap imports , to blow apart any competition .
In the October 1996 issue of Wal - Mart Today , an internal company newsletter , Tom Coughlin , executive vice president for operations , summed up the approach : " At Wal - Mart , we make dust .
Our competitors eat dust . "
In looking at Iowa , we encounter a myth : that when Wal - Mart opened a store in Town A , it may have hurt by a small amount the sales of stores in other towns neighboring Town Aas the people from the other towns went to Wal - Mart to do some of their shopping ; but nonetheless , Wal - Mart so increased the volume of sales at its own store and other stores in Town A , that the stores in the overall region experienced significant sales growth and job growth .
Wal - Mart hired compliant research and marketing firms to " prove " this point .
This is a lie .
We look at what happened to Iowa communities of 5,000 or fewer people .
Significant research has been done in this area by Prof. Kenneth Stone of Iowa State University , which we draw upon .
Since it is difficult to see what effect occurred after only one or two years , we look at the effects after ten years or longer .
Using sales tax records , Professor Stone compared the change in sales volume at stores located in towns where Wal - Mart opened one of its stores ( a " Wal - Mart Town " ) , and in the neighboring towns where Wal - mart did not open a store ( " Neighboring Non Wal - Mart Town " ) .
In cases selected from the study , the sales at Wal - Mart stores themselves are not included , since the focus here is to measure the " Wal - Mart effect " : Once Wal - Mart opens a store , what happens to all the other stores in the neighboring communities , in Iowa communities of 5,000 or fewer people ?
Figure 1 presents the change in sales volume for Iowa home furnishings stores ( furniture stores , major appliance stores , drapery stores , etc. ) .
One year after Wal - Mart opened a store in a town , in the Neighboring Non Wal - Mart Towns , at home furnishing stores the sales volume collapsed by 14 % .
People from the Non Wal - Mart Towns travelled to the towns where a Wal - Mart had opened , to purchase a share of their home furnishings at the Wal - Mart store .
However , by the tenth year after the Wal - Mart store had opened , in the Neighboring Non Wal - Mart Towns , at home furnishing stores the sales volume had fallen a stunning 31 % below the level it had been ten years earlier .
A large number of home furnishing stores were forced to close .
In the Wal - Mart Towns , by the tenth year after the Wal - Mart store had opened , the sales volume at home furnishing stores had declined by only 1 % .
Clearly , the home furnishing stores located at Neighboring Non Wal - Mart Towns , had suffered the brunt of the damage .
Figure 2 presents the change in sales volume for Iowa specialty stores ( sporting goods stores , druggists , jewelry stores , card and gift shops , florists , etc. ) .
In the Wal - Mart Towns , by the tenth year after the Wal - Mart store had opened , the sales volume at specialty stores had plunged by 17 % .
In the Neighboring Non Wal - Mart Towns , by the tenth year after the Wal - Mart store had opened , the sales volume at specialty stores had tumbled by 28 % .
Figure 3 presents the change in sales volume for Iowa apparel stores , showing a 28 % decline by the tenth year in both Wal - Mart Towns and Non Wal - Mart Towns .
The Wal - Mart Towns had not escaped the Wal - Mart effect .
Thus , Wal - Mart 's assertion that the sales by a range of stores in Neighboring Non Wal - Mart Towns would fall by a small amount , and that the sales volume by a range of stores in Wal - Mart Towns would rise significantly , is completely false .
Putting aside this myth , Figure 4 shows the catastrophe caused by the Wal - Mart effect in Iowa , inclusive of towns that did and did not have a Wal - Mart store .
The period under consideration is 1983 - 96 , three years longer than the earlier study , giving three more years of the devastation .
By 1996 , 13 years after a Wal - Mart had opened in a town , the volume of sales at department stores , which includes Wal - Mart and other large discount chains , rose by 42 % .
However , since 1983 , sales at grocery stores fell by 11 % ; sales at drug stores fell by 32 % ; and sales at men's and boys ' stores dropped headlong by 59 % .
Iowa 's retail and grocery stores , which form the underpinning of communities , had been ravaged .
Table 1 shows the second phase of the Wal - Mart effect : the closing of stores whose revenues had collapsed .
All told , a staggering 7,326 stores closed in Iowa communities of 5,000 or less people ( the table covers a ten - year period through 1993 ; were it to cover the longer period through 1996 , the number of store closings would be even greater ) .
The health and vitality of these communities , including employment at rising wages and benefits , the generation of taxes , etc. , will not be restored .
Nationwide Blood - Letting Wal - Mart destroyed other communities and cities .
For example : Toledo , Ohio .
Author Al Norman describes the effect of Wal - Mart and Home Depot ( another outsourcing chain ) on Toledo : " When I went for a walk in downtown Toledo , I passed the old Lamson dry goods store : 9 stories of empty retail space .
Each floor is the size of a football field .
The building served as the home of a Macy 's Department store from 1924 to 1984 .
For the past fourteen years , the store has been empty .
The City now owns it , which means the taxpayers of Toledo are paying the freight for its upkeep . "
Nowata , Oklahoma .
In 1982 , Wal - Mart opened a store on the outskirts of Nowata , a town of 4,000 people .
Half of the small businesses in downtown Nowata shut down .
Then in 1994 , Wal - Mart abruptly closed this store , as well as another in a nearby town , and opened up a supercenter in Bartlesville , which is 30 miles away , leaving Nowata prostrate .
Mississippi .
A study found that in small towns in the state , five years after the opening of a Wal - Mart , the dollar volume of grocery store trade had collapsed 17 % .
Vermont .
In an attempt to stop Wal - Mart from becoming large in the state , various towns passed restrictions that would halt Wal - Mart construction .
Wal - Mart built stores in the neighboring New Hampshire and New York , which sucked business out of Vermont .
Collapsing Tax Revenue Despite all this , many states and communities are using taxpayers ' money to finance subsidies to Wal - Mart , to come in and rape them .
In 1999 , it was reported that in Olivette , Missouri , a developer received a tax incentive of up to $ 38.9 million for a construction project including a Wal - Mart and a Sam's Clubmore than a third of the projected total cost of the project .
In 1998 , it was reported that the city of Chesterfield , Missouri was supplying $ 25.5 million in tax incentives toward the construction of a $ 100 million - plus mall , anchored by a Wal - Mart .
In 2001 , Ohio approved $ 10 million in tax credits and other assistance for Wal - Mart to build two distribution centers and an eyeglass - manufacturing facility .
These insane subsidies draw down the public finances .
At the same time , Wal - Mart decimates the tax - base through other methods :
Many stores which , unlike Wal - Mart , did not get tax breaks , are closed .
This causes the loss to many states of sales taxes , and to all states of corporate profit taxes .
Workers at established stores that have been closed by the Wal - Mart effect , who were paid higher wages than workers at Wal - Mart , have been fired , causing a drop in state income taxes .
Wal - Mart 's outsourcing caused the loss of 1 - 1.5 million manufacturing production jobs , and thus the taxes that these workers and the manufacturing plants that they worked at , would have paid .
States and cities often have to finance downtown revitalization programs for the areas devastated by Wal - Mart .
Wal - Mart certainly produces a wealth effect : the loss of wealth .
Just walk through any community downtown with its empty or boarded - up stores , to see the workings of the Wal - Mart effect .
Thousands of migrants try to enter Europe from Africa every year Moroccan authorities have denied allegations its soldiers deliberately sank a boat off the port of Al Hoceima carrying African migrants to Spain .
Five survivors quoted in the Spanish paper El Pais said soldiers punctured their inflatable boat and threatened to stab those onboard .
They said at least 29 people drowned , four of them children , on 28 April .
The Moroccans say 10 people were drowned and the soldiers saved some migrants and were thanked afterwards .
The BBC's James Copnall in the capital , Rabat , says the reaction from Morocco is extremely unusual .
The authorities do not generally comment on the frequent drownings of migrants off the Moroccan coast , he says .
Harsh
The incident is said to have taken place off Al Hoceima , a port on Morocco 's northern coast .
One of the soldiers jabbed a knife into the rubber and told us , ' Now go to Spain if you want '
Campos El Pais quoted five survivors , from Nigeria and Mali , who said the soldiers punctured the rubber boat with a knife attached to a pole .
" One of the soldiers jabbed a knife into the rubber and told us , ' Now go to Spain if you want , ' " one of survivors , identified as Campos , said .
" We asked them to take us back with them to Morocco because , with the boat in the state it was , it was almost impossible to continue .
We begged them to look at our children and babies . "
Survivors say a Moroccan officer then punctured the boat again , and it sank almost immediately .
Another Moroccan launch came to help the drowning migrants , according to El Pais .
Our correspondent says it is difficult to establish the truth of the matter .
A human rights activist in the northern town of Oujda , near where many sub-Saharan migrants stay , told the BBC he had heard rumours of an incident like this , but had not been able to confirm the story with the migrants he knew .
One African diplomat based in Morocco told the BBC the Moroccan authorities occasionally treated sub-Saharan migrants harshly , a claim backed up by several Moroccan human rights associations .
Still , an incident of this nature would be extremely unusual , our reporter says .
However , he says , migrants do often drown as they attempt to get to Europe .
According to one Spanish non-governmental organisation , more than 900 migrants died at sea trying to cross to Spain in 2007 .

What are these ?
Why Apple Wo n’t Buy Adobe
This one ’s pretty simple .
First , Steve Jobs wants
Apple to feel like a small , focused company .
They ’re not a small company , of course — Apple ’s most recent quarterly filing states they have 21,600 employees — but that ’s what Jobs wants it to feel like .
The company ’s internal structure is a reflection of its product lines — simple and clear .
Buying Adobe — a $ 20 billion company with a slew of products and nearly 7,000 employees — is not how you keep Apple feeling small and focused .
And keep in mind that half of Apple ’s employees are in retail .
Second , Apple , under Jobs , is only interested in best - of - breed products and technologies .
The iPhone is the best phone in the world .
The iPod is the best media player .
Macs are the best computers .
Mac OS X is the best desktop OS .
i Phone OS is the best mobile OS .
( Reasonable people may disagree about one or more of these “ best ” assessments , but I ’m talking about Apple ’s perspective . )
There are exceptions , but only at the periphery of Apple ’s offerings .
Mac OS X Server , for example , is n’t generally considered the best server OS in the world , but it does n’t get much promotional oomph , either .
.
Mac is . bad , but you wait and see if Apple does n’t knock it down and replace it with something reliable and more relevant and useful .
What does Adobe have that Apple would want to own ?
Flash seems to be the most common answer amongst those who think Apple covets Adobe .
Do you really think Flash is the best of anything ?
Or , more relevantly , do you really think Jobs and Apple ’s engineering management think so ?
Flash is ubiquitous , but that does n’t make it good .
It ’s the same reason why iPhone app development is based on Objective - C rather than a more popular , more ubiquitous language like , say , Java — because the decision - makers at Apple genuinely believe it to be decidedly better .
If Apple wanted to own a technology like Flash they ’d build their own technically superior version and distribute it to Windows users with iTunes .
This goes double for AIR , which Apple , I ’m certain , thinks they could do better than , and which unlike Flash does n’t yet have any significant popularity .
The CS apps , you say ?
Why ?
To make sure there are good photo- editing , illustration , and desktop publishing apps for the Mac ?
Adobe is already doing that themselves , as an independent company .
The only argument I ’ve ever heard that makes sense for an Apple acquisition of Adobe is the idea that Apple fears that Microsoft might buy Adobe first , and then torpedo the Mac versions of the CS suite .
But that would be a totally defensive move , and Steve Jobs is not a defensive thinker .
Jobs plays offense .
If it ever became necessary , Jobs surely believes that Apple could create their own replacements for Photoshop , Illustrator , and InDesign .
And the whole idea does n’t make much sense anyway , given that if Microsoft wanted to sink a suite of popular big - ticket Mac apps , they do n’t need to buy Adobe .
And so if Apple , under Jobs , is tightly focused , what is it that they ’re focused on ?
It ’s not the pro market .
It ’s mobility — iPhone , iPod , MacBook Air .
Adobe is a good company with good products , but they do n’t fit into Apple ’s focus at all .
CoreCodec , the company behind the high - performance CoreAVC H.264 implementation , issued an apology this morning for its recent abuse of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , a law that broadly prohibits circumvention of copy - protection mechanisms .
In a DMCA takedown notice sent to Google over the weekend , CoreCodec demanded that Google cease hosting coreavc - for - linux , an open source project that provided a Linux compatibility layer for the CoreAVC codec .
The DMCA notice claimed that the open - source project infringes CoreCodec 's copyright and includes CoreAVC code .
Although Google complied with the notice and removed the project , the allegations made by CoreCodec were entirely without merit .
The coreavc - for - linux project contains no infringing code and is merely a compatibility wrapper that enables legitimately purchased copies of CoreAVC to be used by Linux users .
In a statement published today in CoreCodec 's community forums , cofounder Dan Marlin apologized and said that the company is working with Google to get the project back online .
He explains that CoreCodec had some concerns about reverse - engineering that they were working privately to resolve with Alan Nisota , the lead developer of the coreavc - for - linux project , and that the DMCA notice was sent because the company 's overzealous legal counsel wrongfully believed that it was a necessary part of the process .
" The DMCA does allow for reverse engineering for compatibility purposes and hence in the end no matter what the ' other points ' are the DMCA takedown request was wrongly sent , " wrote Marlin in a public statement .
" I 'd like to publicly apologize to Alan for the disconnect between him and us as well as the disruption to the project as there was no ill will intended and we were already working on a resolution with him before this went public . "
Marlin says that that CoreCodec has established a new internal process for handling intellectual property issues so that they wo n't improperly use the DMCA again in the future .
CoreCodec will also be assisting Nisota with his ongoing development efforts to ensure that coreavc - for - linux users can continue buying and using the CoreAVC codec .
In the long - term CoreCodec also hopes to release a GStreamer - based CoreAVC codec so that they can officially support Linux users .
This situation highlights some of the serious flaws of the DMCA .
Companies often issue takedown notices without fully understanding the situation and hosting providers often acquiesce in order to avoid any potential liability .
All too often , DMCA takedown notices are used as a tool to censor and intimidate rather than a vehicle for addressing instances of infringement .

Fox trumps Netroots ; bloggers rebel
The nation ’s top Democrats are suddenly rushing to appear on the Fox News Channel , which they once had shunned as enemy territory as the nemesis of liberal bloggers .
The détente with Fox has provoked a backlash from progressive bloggers , who contend the party ’s leaders are turning their backs on the base — and lending credibility and legitimacy to the network liberals love to hate — in a quest for a few swing votes .

In a span of eight days , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - NY . ) and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean are all taking their seats with the network that calls itself “ fair and balanced ” but is widely viewed as skewing conservative .
With the party ’s presidential contest reduced to hand - to - hand combat , Democrats are turning to the ratings leader among cable news channels in a clear rebuff to the liberal activists known as the Netroots .
Markos Moulitsas , founder of the leading liberal site Daily Kos , told Politico ’s Michael Calderone : " Democrats are being idiotic by going on that network . ”
Ari Melber , the Net movement correspondent for The Nation , told Politico by phone that progressive activists and the Netroots are “ not happy about it . ”
“ I do n’t think that it is tenable to completely neglect or ignore what your base wants , ” Melber said .
The Democratic leaders ’ new openness to Fox reflects the liberal left ’s diminishing power , at least at this point in the political cycle .
Once feared by the Democratic candidates , these activists are now viewed at least in part as an impediment to winning the broad swatch of support needed to clinch the nomination .
Goaded in part by a taunting “ Obama Watch ” clock displayed by Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace , Obama appeared last Sunday after resisting the show ’s entreaties throughout the campaign .
Clinton had a civil interview on Wednesday night with prime - time host Bill O’Reilly , who has often mocked her husband .
And Dean will appear this weekend on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Early in this presidential race , John Edwards led the Democratic candidates in what amounted to a Fox boycott .
Edwards appeared on Fox 33 times between August 2000 and January 2007 , the month after he announced his campaign , and has never been back .
Roger Ailes , the president of Fox News , took the boycott in stride , commenting that more Democrats watch Fox than watch CNN or MSNBC , the channel ’s cable news competitors .
Recognizing that Obama ’s appearance risked incurring blog wrath , a “ senior Obama adviser ” vowed to Greg Sargent of Talking Points Memo before the interview that the senator would “ take Fox on ” during the broadcast .
But the interview turned out to be a civil give and take , with no pushback against Fox .
Afterward , Sargent wrote that the pledge had turned out to be merely “ a bunch of tough talk . ”
“ This will likely further dismay liberal bloggers who had worked very hard to get Dems to boycott Fox as a way of delegitimizing the network and who already criticized Obama for agreeing to appear in the first place , ” Sargent wrote .
Network records show that since the campaign began in January 2007 , Clinton has given 13 interviews to Fox News anchors and correspondents , and Obama has given 10 .
YANGON ( Reuters ) - With state TV only showing footage of generals handing out food at model tented villages , people in Myanmar are snapping up bootleg video discs of bloated corpses , desperate refugees and villages ravaged by Cyclone Nargis .
“ Myanmar television is useless , ” said one Yangon businessman who bought the underground VCDs because he wanted to see the raw , uncensored version of the storm that killed his brother in Labutta , one of the hardest - hit towns in the Irrawaddy delta .
“ I want to see what really happened , ” the man , who asked not to be named , said .
Two weeks after Nargis struck , the former Burma ’s military rulers have admitted that nearly 78,000 people were killed and another 56,000 are missing after one of the most devastating cyclones ever to hit Asia .
Yet still they refuse to accept large - scale foreign relief operations , and insist the army is well on top of the distribution of supplies in an area of delta the size of Austria .
State media , rigidly controlled by the junta , is reporting nothing of the concerns of international aid agencies for the 2.5 million people left clinging to survival , or the columns of beggars lining mud-clogged roads coming out of the delta .
Instead , it has been pumping out sound bites from Prime Minister Thein Sein saying the situation is under control .
“ We have already finished our first phase of emergency relief .
We are going into the second phase , the rebuilding stage , ” he said .
BLOATED CORPSES
The uncut footage on the two VCDs presents a very different picture .
Although one vendor said some pictures were taken from the Internet , two large segments -- one 53 minutes long , the other 25 minutes -- appear to have been shot by Myanmar state television .
Some of the images of flooded paddy fields and army officers handing food to villagers have made it to air .
The pictures of rotting corpses and desperate survivors have not .
One VCD shows aerial views of the delta from a helicopter before soldiers land in a devastated village by the sea .
The cameraman films a dozen bloated and blackened bodies lying in pools of water as two men clinging to plastic jerry cans try to swim across a fast - flowing river .
The helicopter returns to the village later with some boxes of instant noodles .
The second disc , marked “ Labutta ” , shows people carrying white coffins through the streets , an elderly man lying on a table , his ankle crushed , and a man with the skin peeled off the back of his head .
Next comes a six - minute clip of people and water buffaloes lying dead in paddyfields as survivors walk past with a few salvaged possessions on their heads .
With so little public trust in the state media and many Internet news sites blocked , most people rely for information on Burmese - language radio broadcasts from outside the country .
The other source is simple word of mouth .
At one VCD stall , the vendor and a policeman peppered the businessman , who had just returned from Labutta , with questions about the cyclone :
How did people die ?
Why do survivors stay in their villages and not go to camps ?
His replies -- impossible to verify -- feed into the morass of rumor and half - truth that passes for news in one of the most information - starved countries on earth .
“ There are corpses with their ears and hands cut off because they were wearing jewelry , ” he said .
“ At one village , soldiers fired into the air to force people to leave and go to a camp . ”

Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann worked at the highest levels of the Bush administration as Middle East policy experts for the National Security Council .
Mann conducted secret negotiations with Iran .
Leverett traveled with Colin Powell and advised Condoleezza Rice .
They each played crucial roles in formulating policy for the region leading up to the war in Iraq .
But when they left the White House , they left with a growing sense of alarm -- not only was the Bush administration headed straight for war with Iran , it had been set on this course for years .
That was what people did n't realize .
It was just like Iraq , when the White House was so eager for war it could n't wait for the UN inspectors to leave .
The steps have been many and steady and all in the same direction .
And now things are getting much worse .
We are getting closer and closer to the tripline , they say .
" The hard - liners are upping the pressure on the State Department , " says Leverett .
" They 're basically saying , ' You 've been trying to engage Iran for more than a year now and what do you have to show for it ?
They keep building more centrifuges , they 're sending this IED stuff over into Iraq that 's killing American soldiers , the human - rights internal political situation has gotten more repressive -- what the hell do you have to show for this engagement strategy ? ' "
But the engagement strategy was never serious and was designed to fail , they say .
Over the last year , Rice has begun saying she would talk to " anybody , anywhere , anytime , " but not to the Iranians unless they stopped enriching uranium first .
That 's not a serious approach to diplomacy , Mann says .
Diplomacy is about talking to your enemies .
That 's how wars are averted .
You work up to the big things .
And when U.S. ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker had his much - publicized meeting with his Iranian counterpart in Baghdad this spring , he did n't even have permission from the White House to schedule a second meeting .
The most ominous new development is the Bush administration 's push to name the Iranian Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization .
" The U.S. has designated any number of states over the years as state sponsors of terrorism , " says Leverett .
" But here for the first time the U.S. is saying that part of a government is itself a terrorist organization . "
This is what Leverett and Mann fear will happen :
The diplomatic effort in the United Nations will fail when it becomes clear that Russia 's and China 's geopolitical ambitions will not accommodate the inconvenience of energy sanctions against Iran .
Without any meaningful incentive from the U.S. to be friendly , Iran will keep meddling in Iraq and installing nuclear centrifuges .
This will trigger a response from the hard - liners in the White House , who feel that it is their moral duty to deal with Iran before the Democrats take over American foreign policy .
" If you get all those elements coming together , say in the first half of ' 08 , " says Leverett , " what is this president going to do ?
I think there is a serious risk he would decide to order an attack on the Iranian nuclear installations and probably a wider target zone . "
This would result in a dramatic increase in attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq , attacks by proxy forces like Hezbollah , and an unknown reaction from the wobbly states of Afghanistan and Pakistan , where millions admire Iran 's resistance to the Great Satan .
" As disastrous as Iraq has been , " says Mann , " an attack on Iran could engulf America in a war with the entire Muslim world . "
Mann and Leverett believe that none of this had to be .
Flynt Lawrence Leverett grew up in Fort Worth and went to Texas Christian University .
He spent the first nine years of his government career as a CIA analyst specializing in the Middle East .
He voted for George Bush in 2000 .
On the day the assassins of Al Qaeda flew two hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center , Colin Powell summoned him to help plan the response .
Five months later , Leverett landed a plum post on the National Security Council .
When Condoleezza Rice discussed the Middle East with President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld , Leverett was the man standing behind her taking notes and whispering in her ear .
Today , he sits on the back deck of a house tucked into the curve of a leafy suburban street in McLean , Virginia , a forty - nine - year - old white American man wearing khakis and a white dress shirt and wire - rimmed glasses .
Mann sits next to him , also wearing khakis .
She 's thirty - nine but looks much younger , with straight brown hair and a tomboy 's open face .
The polish on her toenails is pink .
If you saw her around McLean , you would n't hesitate :
Soccer mom .
Classic soccer mom .
But with degrees from Brandeis and Harvard Law and stints at Tel Aviv University and the powerful Israeli lobby known as AIPAC , she has even better right - wing credentials than her husband .
As they talk , eating grapes out of a bowl , lawn mowers hum and birds chirp .
The floor is littered with toy trucks and rubber animals left behind by the youngest of their four children .
But the tranquillity is misleading .
When Mann and Leverett went public with the inside story behind the impending disaster with Iran , the White House dismissed them .
Then it imposed prior restraint on them , an extraordinary episode of government censorship .
Finally , it threatened them .
Now they are afraid of the White House , and watching what they say .
But still , they feel they have to speak out .
Like so many things these days , this story began on the morning of September 11 , 2001 .
On Forty - fifth Street in Manhattan , Mann had just been evacuated from the offices of the U.S. mission to the United Nations and was walking home to her apartment on Thirty - eighth Street -- walking south , toward the giant plume of smoke .
When her cell phone rang , she picked it up immediately because her sister worked at the World Trade Center and she was frantic for word .
But it was n't her sister , it was a senior Iranian diplomat .
To protect him from reprisals from the Iranian government , she does n't want to name him , but she describes him as a cultured man in his fifties with salt - and - pepper hair .
Since early spring , they had been meeting secretly in a small conference room at the UN .
" Are you all right ? " he asked .
Yes , she said , she was fine .
The attack was a terrible tragedy , he said , doubtless the work of Al Qaeda .
" I hope that we can still work together , " he said .
Brian Berman
That same day , in Washington , on the seventh floor of the State Department building , a security guard opened the door of Leverett 's office and told him they were evacuating the building .
Leverett was Powell 's specialist on terrorist states like Syria and Libya , so he knew the world was about to go through a dramatic change .
As he joined the people milling on the sidewalk , his mind was already racing .
Then he got a call summoning him back to Foggy Bottom .
At the entrance to a specially fortified office , he showed his badge to the guards and passed into a windowless conference room .
There were about a dozen people there , Powell 's top foreign - policy planners .
Powell told them that their first job was to make plans to capture or kill Osama bin Laden .
The second job was to rally allies .
That meant detailed strategies for approaching other nations -- in some cases , Powell could make the approach , in others the president would have to make the call .
Then Powell left them to work through the night .
At 5:30 a.m. on September 12 , they walked the list to the office of the deputy secretary of state , Richard Armitage .
Powell took it straight to the White House .
Mann and Leverett did n't know each other then , but they were already traveling down parallel tracks .
Months before September 11 , Mann had been negotiating with the Iranian diplomat at the UN .
After the attacks , the meetings continued , sometimes alone and sometimes with their Russian counterpart sitting in .
Soon they traded the conference room for the Delegates ' Lounge , an airy two - story bar with ashtrays for all the foreigners who were used to smoking indoors .
One day , up on the second floor where the windows overlooked the East River , the diplomat told her that Iran was ready to cooperate unconditionally , a phrase that had seismic diplomatic implications .
Unconditional talks are what the U.S. had been demanding as a precondition to any official diplomatic contact between the U.S. and Iran .
And it would be the first chance since the Islamic revolution for any kind of rapprochement .
" It was revolutionary , " Mann says .
" It could have changed the world . "
A few weeks later , after signing on to Condoleezza Rice 's staff as the new Iran expert in the National Security Council , Mann flew to Europe with Ryan Crocker -- then a deputy assistant secretary of state -- to hold talks with a team of Iranian diplomats .
Meeting in a light - filled conference room at the old UN building in Geneva , they hammered out plans for Iranian help in the war against the Taliban .
The Iranians agreed to provide assistance if any American was shot down near their territory , agreed to let the U.S. send food in through their border , and even agreed to restrain some " really bad Afghanis , " like a rabidly anti-American warlord named Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , quietly putting him under house arrest in Tehran .
These were significant concessions .
At the same time , special envoy James Dobbins was having very public and warm discussions in Bonn with the Iranian deputy foreign minister as they worked together to set up a new government for Afghanistan .
And the Iranians seemed eager to help in more tactical ways as well .
They had intimate knowledge of Taliban strategic capabilities and they wanted to share it with the Americans .
One day during the U.S. bombing campaign , Mann and her Iranian counterparts were sitting around the wooden conference table speculating about the future Afghani constitution .
Suddenly the Iranian who knew so much about intelligence matters started pounding on the table .
" Enough of that ! " he shouted , unfurling a map of Afghanistan .
Here was a place the Americans needed to bomb .
And here , and here , he angrily jabbed his finger at the map .
Leverett spent those days in his office at the State Department building , watching the revolution in the Middle East and coming up with plans on how to capture the lightning .
Suddenly countries like Syria and Libya and Sudan and Iran were coming forward with offers of help , which raised a vital question -- should they stay on the same enemies list as North Korea and Iraq , or could there be a new slot for " friendly " sponsors of terror ?
As a CIA analyst , Leverett had come to the view that Middle Eastern terrorism was more tactical than religious .
Syria wanted the Golan Heights back and did n't have the military strength to put up a serious fight against Israel , so it relied on " asymmetrical methods . "
Accepting this idea meant that nations like Syria were n't locked in a fanatic mind - set , that they could evolve to use new methods , so Leverett told Powell to seize the moment and draw up a " road map " to peace for the problem countries of the Middle East -- expel your terrorist groups and stop trying to develop weapons of mass destruction , and we will take you off the sponsors - of - terrorism list and start a new era of cooperation .
That December , just after the triumph over Afghanistan , Powell took the idea to the White House .
The occasion was the regular " deputies meeting " at the Situation Room .
Gathered around the table were the deputy secretary of state , the deputy secretary of defense , the deputy director of the CIA , a representative from Vice - President Cheney 's office , and also the deputy national security advisor , Stephen Hadley .
Hadley hated the idea .
So did the representatives from Rumsfeld and Cheney .
They thought that it was a reward for bad behavior , that the sponsors of terrorism should stop just because it 's the right thing to do .
After the meeting , Hadley wrote up a brief memo that came to be known as Hadley 's Rules :
If a state like Syria or Iran offers specific assistance , we will take it without offering anything in return .
We will accept it without strings or promises .
We wo n't try to build on it .
Leverett thought that was simply nutty .
To strike postures of moral purity , they were throwing away a chance for real progress .
But just a few days later , Condoleezza Rice called him into her office , warming him up with talk of how classical music shaped their childhoods .
As he told her about the year he spent studying classical piano at the Liszt Academy in Budapest , Leverett felt a real connection .
Then she said she was looking for someone to take the job of senior director of Mideast affairs at the National Security Council , someone who would take a real leadership role on the Palestinian issue .
Big changes were coming in 2002 .
He repeated his firm belief that the White House had to draw up a road map with real solutions to the division of Jerusalem and the problem of refugees , something with final borders .
That was the only remedy to the crisis in the Middle East .
Just after the New Year , Rice called and offered him the job .
Brian Berman
The bowl of grapes is empty and the plate of cheese moves to the center of the table .
Leverett 's teenage son comes in with questions about a teacher .
Periodically , Mann interrupts herself .
" This is off the record , " she says .
" This is going to have to be on background . "
She 's not allowed to talk about confidential documents or intelligence matters , but the topic of her negotiations with the Iranians is especially touchy .
" As far as they 're concerned , the whole idea that there were talks is something I should n't even be talking about , " she says .
All ranks and ranking are out .
" They do n't want there to be anything about the level of the talks or who was involved . "
" They wo n't even let us say something like ' senior ' or ' important , ' ' high - ranking , ' or ' high - level , ' " Leverett says .
But the important thing is that the Iranians agreed to talk unconditionally , Mann says .
" They specifically told me time and again that they were doing this because they understood the impact of this attack on the U.S. , and they thought that if they helped us unconditionally , that would be the way to change the dynamic for the first time in twenty - five years . "
She believed them .
But while Leverett was still moving into the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House , Mann was wrapped up in the crisis over a ship called the Karin A that left Iran loaded with fifty tons of weapons .
According to the Israeli navy , which intercepted the Karin A in the Red Sea , it was headed for the PLO .
In staff meetings at the White House , Mann argued for caution .
The Iranian government probably did n't even know about the arms shipments .
It was issuing official denials in the most passionate way , even sending its deputy foreign minister onto Fox News to say " categorically " that " all segments of the Iranian government " had nothing to do with the arms shipment , which meant the " total government , not simply President Khatami's administration . "
Bush waited .
Three weeks later , it was time for his 2002 State of the Union address .
Mann spent the morning in a meeting with Condoleezza Rice and the new president of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai , who kept asking Rice for an expanded international peacekeeping force .
Rice kept saying that the Afghans would have to solve their own problems .
Then they went off to join the president 's motorcade and Mann headed back to her office to watch the speech on TV .
That was the speech in which Bush linked Iran to Iraq and North Korea with a memorable phrase :
" States like these , and their terrorist allies , constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world . "
The Iranians had been engaging in high - level diplomacy with the American government for more than a year , so the phrase was shocking and profound .
After that , the Iranian diplomats skipped the monthly meeting in Geneva .
But they came again in March .
And so did Mann .
" They said they had put their necks out to talk to us and they were taking big risks with their careers and their families and their lives , " Mann says .
The secret negotiations with Iran continued , every month for another year .
Leverett plunged right into a dramatic new peace proposal floated by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia .
Calling for " full normalization " in exchange for " full withdrawal " from the occupied territories , Abdullah promised to rally all the Arab nations to a final settlement with Israel .
In his brand - new third - floor office at the Old Executive Office Building , a tiny room with a very high ceiling , Leverett began hammering out the details with Abdullah 's foreign - policy advisor , Adel Al - Jubeir .
When Ariel Sharon said that a return to the ' 67 borders was unacceptable , Al - Jubeir said the Saudis did n't want to be in the " real estate business " -- if the Palestinians agreed to border modifications , the Saudis could hardly refuse them .
Al - Jubeir believed he had something that might actually work .
But the White House was n't interested .
Sharon already rejected it , Rice told Leverett .
At the Arab League meeting , Abdullah got every Arab state to sign his proposal in a unanimous vote .
The White House still was n't interested .
Then violence in the Palestinian territories began to increase , climaxing in an Israeli siege of Arafat 's compound .
In April , Leverett accompanied Colin Powell on a tour that took them from Morocco to Egypt and Jordan and Lebanon and finally Israel .
Twice they crossed the Israeli-army lines to visit Arafat under siege .
Powell seemed to think he had authorization from the White House to explore what everyone was calling " political horizons , " the safely vague shorthand for a peaceful future , so on the final day Leverett holed up in a suite at the David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem with a group of senior American officials -- the U. . ambassador to Israel , the U. S. consul general to Jerusalem , assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs Bill Burns -- trying to hammer out Powell 's last speech .
Then the phone rang .
It was Stephen Hadley on the phone from the White House .
" Tell Powell he is not authorized to talk about a political horizon , " he said .
" Those are formal instructions . "
" This is a bad idea , " Leverett remembers saying .
" It 's bad policy and it's also humiliating for Powell , who has been talking to heads of state about this very issue for the last ten days . "
" It does n't matter , " Hadley said .
" There 's too much resistance from Rumsfeld and the VP .
Those are the instructions . "
So Leverett went back into the suite and asked Powell to step aside .
Powell was furious , Leverett remembers .
" What is it they 're afraid of ? " he demanded .
" Who the hell are they afraid of ? "
" I do n't know sir , " Leverett said .
In the spring , Crown Prince Abdullah flew to Texas to meet Bush at his ranch .
The way Leverett remembers the story , Abdullah sat down and told Bush he was going to ask a direct question and wanted a direct answer .
Are you going to do anything about the Palestinian issue ?
If you tell me no , if it 's too difficult , if you 're not going to give it that kind of priority , just tell me .
I will understand and I will never say anything critical of you or your leadership in public , but I 'm going to need to make my own judgments and my own decisions about Saudi interests .
Bush tried to stall , saying he understood his concerns and would see what he could do .
Abdullah stood up .
" That 's it .
This meeting is over . "
No Arab leader had ever spoken to Bush like that before , Leverett says .
But Saudi Arabia was a key ally in the war on terror , vital to the continued U.S. oil supply , so Bush and Rice and Powell excused themselves into another room for a quick huddle .
When he came back , Bush gave Abdullah his word that he would deal seriously with the Palestinian issue .
" Okay , " Abdullah said .
" The president of the United States has given me his word . "
So the meeting continued , ending with a famous series of photographs of Bush and Abdullah riding around the ranch in Bush 's pickup .
In a meeting at the White House a few days later , Leverett saw Powell shaking his head over Abdullah 's threat .
He called it " the near - death experience . "
Bush rolled his eyes .
" We sure do n't want to go through anything like that again . "
Then the king of Jordan came to Washington to see Bush .
There had to be a road map for peace in Palestine , the king said .
Despite the previous experience with Abdullah in Crawford , Bush seemed taken by surprise , Leverett remembers , but he listened and said that the idea of a road map seemed pretty reasonable .
So suddenly they were working on a road map .
For moderate Arab states , the hope of a two - state solution would offer some political cover before Washington embarked on any invasion of Iraq .
In a meeting with the king of Jordan , Leverett made a personal promise that it would be out by the end of 2002 .
But nothing happened .
In Cheney 's and Rumsfeld 's offices , opposition came from men like John Hannah , Doug Feith , and Scooter Libby .
In Rice 's office , there was Elliott Abrams .
Again they said that negotiation was just a reward for bad behavior .
First the Palestinians had to reject terrorism and practice democracy .
Finally , it was a bitter - cold day just after Thanksgiving and Leverett was on a family trip to the Washington Zoo , standing in front of the giraffe enclosure .
The White House patched through a call from the foreign minister of Jordan , Marwan Muasher , who said that Rice had just told him the road map was off .
" Do you have any idea how this has pulled the rug out from under us , from under me ? "
Muasher said .
" I 'm the one that has to go into Arab League meetings and get beat up and say , ' No , there 's going to be a plan out by the end of the year . '
How can we ever trust you again ? "
On Monday , Leverett went straight to Rice 's office for an explanation .
She told him that Ariel Sharon had called early elections in Israel and asked Bush to shelve any Palestinian plan .
This time Leverett could n't hide his exasperation .
" You told the whole world you were going to put this out before Christmas , " he said .
" Because one Israeli politician told you it 's going to make things politically difficult for him , you do n't put it out ?
Do you realize how hard that makes things for all our Arab partners ? "
Rice sat impassively behind her broad desk .
" If we put the road map out , " she said , " it will interfere with Israeli elections . "
" You are interfering with Israeli elections , just in another way . "
" Flynt , the decision has already been made , " Rice said .
There was also an awkward scene with the secretary of defense .
They were in the Situation Room and Leverett was sitting behind Rice taking notes when suddenly Rumsfeld addressed him directly .
" Why are you laughing ?
Did I say something funny ? "
The room went silent , and Rumsfeld asked it again .
" Why are you laughing ?
Did I say something funny ? "
" I 'm sorry Mr. Secretary , I do n't think I know what you 're talking about . "
" It looks to me like you were laughing , " Rumsfeld said .
" No sir .
I 'm sorry if I gave that impression .
I was just listening to the meeting and taking notes .
Did n't mean to disturb you . "
The meeting continued , message received .
By that time , Leverett and Mann had met and fallen in love .
They got married in February 2003 , went to Florida on their honeymoon , and got back just in time for the Shock and Awe bombing campaign .
Leverett quit his NSC job in disgust .
Mann rotated back to the State Department .
Then came the moment that would lead to an extraordinary battle with the Bush administration .
It was an average morning in April , about four weeks into the war .
Mann picked up her daily folder and sat down at her desk , glancing at a fax cover page .
The fax was from the Swiss ambassador to Iran , which was n't unusual -- since the U.S. had no formal relationship with Iran , the Swiss ambassador represented American interests there and often faxed over updates on what he was doing .
This time he'd met with Sadeq Kharrazi , a well - connected Iranian who was the nephew of the foreign minister and son - in - law to the supreme leader .
Amazingly , Kharrazi had presented the ambassador with a detailed proposal for peace in the Middle East , approved at the highest levels in Tehran .
A two - page summary was attached .
Scanning it , Mann was startled by one dramatic concession after another -- " decisive action " against all terrorists in Iran , an end of support for Hamas and the Islamic Jihad , a promise to cease its nuclear program , and also an agreement to recognize Israel .
This was huge .
Mann sat down and drafted a quick memo to her boss , Richard Haass .
It was important to send a swift and positive response .
Then she heard that the White House had already made up its mind -- it was going to ignore the offer .
Its only response was to lodge a formal complaint with the Swiss government about their ambassador 's meddling .
A few days after that , a terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia killed thirty - four people , including eight Americans , and an intelligence report said the bombers had been in phone contact with Al Qaeda members in Iran .
Although it was unknown whether Tehran had anything to do with the bombing or if the terrorists were hiding out in the lawless areas near the border , Rumsfeld set the tone for the administration 's response at his next press conference .
" There 's no question but that there have been and are today senior Al Qaeda leaders in Iran , and they are busy . "
Colin Powell saw Mann 's memo .
A couple weeks later he approached her at a State Department reception and said , " It was a very good memo .
I could n't sell it at the White House . "
In response to questions from Esquire , Colin Powell called Leverett " very able " and confirms much of what he says .
Leverett 's account of the clash between Bush and Crown Prince Abdullah was accurate , he said .
" It was a very serious moment and no one wanted to see if the Saudis were bluffing . "
The same goes for the story about his speech in Israel in 2002 .
" I had major problems with the White House on what I wanted to say . "
On the subject of the peace offer , though , Powell was defensive .
" I talked to all of my key assistants since Flynt started talking about an Iranian grand bargain , but none of us recall seeing this initiative as a grand bargain . "
On the general subject of negotiations with Iran , he responded with pointed politesse .
" We talked to the Iranians quietly up until 2003 .
The president chose not to continue that channel . "
That is putting it mildly .
In May of 2003 , when the U.S. was still in the triumphant " mission accomplished " phase of the Iraq war , word started filtering out of the White House about an aggressive new Iran policy that would include efforts to destabilize the Iranian government and even to promote a popular uprising .
In his first public statement on Iran policy since leaving the NSC , Leverett told The Washington Post he thought the White House was making a dangerous mistake .
" What it means is we will end up with an Iran that has nuclear weapons and no dialogue with the United States . "
In the years that followed , he spoke out in dozens of newspaper editorials and a book , all making variations on the same argument -- America 's approach to rogue nations was all sticks and no carrots , all economic sanctions and threats of war without any dialogue .
" To bring about real change , " he argued , " we must also offer concrete benefits . "
Of course states like Iran and Syria messed around in Iraq , he said .
Iran was supporting the Iraqi opposition when the U.S. was still supporting Saddam Hussein .
It was insane to expect them to stop when the goal of a Shiite Iraq was finally in reach .
The only way to solve the underlying issues was to offer Iran a " grand bargain " that would recognize the legitimacy of Iran 's government and its right to a role in the region .
But that was an unthinkable thought .
The White House ignored him .
Democrats ignored him .
The Brookings Institution declined to renew his contract .
Then he started talking about the peace offer .
By then it was 2006 and the war was n't going well and suddenly people started to respond :
You mean Iran is n't evil ?
They helped fight the Taliban ?
They wanted to make peace ?
He summed it all up in a long paper for a Washington think tank that happened to be scheduled for publication last November , a vulnerable time for the White House , just after the Democrats swept the midterm elections and the Iraq Study Group released its report calling for negotiations with Syria and Iran .
When he submitted the paper to the CIA for a routine review , they told him the CIA had no problem with it but someone from the NSC called to complain .
" You should n't have cleared this without letting the White House take a look at it , " the official said .
Leverett told them he was n't going to let White House operatives judge his criticisms of White House operatives and distilled his argument into an op - ed piece for The New York Times .
This time he shared a byline with his wife , who had experienced the peace offer up close .
They submitted their first draft to the CIA and the State Department on a Sunday in early December , expecting to hear back the next day .
The next morning , Leverett gave a blistering talk on Bush 's Iran policy to the influential conservatives at the Cato Institute .
The speech was carried live on C - SPAN .
Later that day , he flew to New York and made the same arguments at a private dinner with the UN ambassadors of Russia and Britain .
He was starting to have an impact .
By Tuesday , he still had n't heard from the CIA review board .
They called on Wednesday and told him that there was nothing classified in the piece as far as the agency was concerned , but someone in the West Wing was n't happy with it and would be redacting large sections .
" You 're the clearing agency , " Leverett said .
" You 're the people named in my agreement . "
They said their hands were tied .
After consulting a lawyer , Leverett and Mann and a researcher worked through the night to assemble a list of public sources where the blacked - out material had already been published .
They also took out one line that might have been based on a classified document .
But the White House would n't budge .
It was a First Amendment showdown .
On Thursday , Leverett and Mann decided to publish the piece with large sections of type blacked out , 168 words in all .
Since the piece had been rendered pretty much incomprehensible , they included a list of public sources .
" To make sense of our op - ed article , readers will have to look up the citations themselves . "
As they tell their story , Mann rushes off to pick up one of their sons from a play date and Leverett takes over , telling what happened over the following months :
Bush sent a second carrier group to the Persian Gulf .
U.S. troops started to arrest Iranians living in Baghdad , accusing them of working with insurgents .
Bush accused Iran of " providing material support " for attacks on U.S. forces , a formulation that suggested a legal justification for a preemptive attack .
Senator Jim Webb of Virginia pushed through an amendment requiring Bush to get congressional authorization for an attack .
Colin Powell broke his long silence with a pointed warning .
" You can't negotiate when you tell the other side , ' Give us what a negotiation would produce before the negotiations start . ' "
Even Henry Kissinger started giving interviews on the need to " exhaust every possibility to come to an understanding with Iran . "
From inside the White House , Leverett was hearing a scary scenario :
The Russians were scheduled to ship fuel rods to the Iranian nuclear reactor in Bushehr , which meant the reactor would become operational by this November , at which point it would be impossible to bomb -- the fallout alone would turn the city into an urban Chernobyl .
The White House was seriously considering a preemptive attack when the Russians cooled things down by saying Iran had n't paid its bills , so they would hold back the Bushehr fuel rods for a while .
That put things into a summer lull .
But by August , tensions were rising again .
U.S. troops in Baghdad arrested an official delegation of Iranian energy experts , leading them out of a hotel in blindfolds and handcuffs .
Then Iran said that it had paid its bills and that the Russians were ready to deliver the Bushehr shipment .
In Time magazine , former CIA officer and author Robert Baer quoted a highly placed White House official :
" IEDs are a casus belli for this administration .
There will be an attack on Iran . "
Mann steps back out on the deck and starts collecting the scattered toys to prepare the house for a dinner party , the typical modern American mother multitasking her way through a busy day .
" The reason I have to be so careful now is that I 'm legally on notice and they will prosecute things that I say or do , " she says , picking up a plastic truck .
" Because of that one article ? "
" Yeah . "
Outside , it 's getting warmer .
There 's a heavy haze and floating bugs and for a moment it feels a bit ominous , a gathering silence , one of those moments when giant pods start to sprout in local basements .
" We 're tired , " Mann says .
" Nobody listens . "
It seems inconceivable to her that once again a war could be coming , and once again no one is listening .
Another pair of lawn mowers joins the chorus and the spell breaks .
A cab pulls in the driveway .
The caterer comes to prepare for the dinner guests .

It ’s part - reptile , part - mammal , part - bird – and totally unique .
Two centuries after European scientists deemed a dead specimen so outlandish it had to be a fake , the bizarre genetic secrets of Australia ’s platypus have been laid bare .
Platypuses lay eggs and produce venom like some reptiles , but they sport furry coats and feed their young with milk like mammals .
The odd creatures are classed as monotremes , with only one close relative – the echidna .
But as primitive mammals that share the same ancestor as humans , a study of the animal ’s genome can improve biologists ’ understanding of how mammals evolved , while illuminating the platypus ’s strange physiology .
Advertisement
Wesley Warren at Washington University in St Louis , Missouri , led the international team that sequenced the platypus genome .
As expected , they found an amalgam of some ancestral reptile and some newer mammalian features .
But there were also surprises .
Ancient milk
Biologists already knew that the platypus has a weird complement of sex chromosomes , but the team found that the gene sequences responsible for determining sex are more like a bird ’s than a mammal’s .
And while the gene that the human sex - determining gene evolved from is present in the platypus genome , it seems to have nothing to do with sex determination .
So , that function must have evolved after the platypus split from our common ancestor , about 166 million years ago .
However , by that time , milk production was well - evolved .
The platypus has the same repertoire of milk protein genes as a cow or a human .
Clearly , milk evolved long before we evolved to give birth to live offspring , says team member Jenny Graves at the Australian National University in Canberra .
The team also investigated the genes for the platypus toxin , which males deliver via a barbed spur on their heel .
While the toxin is similar to a snake ’s – adapted from natural neurotransmitters and other proteins – it seems to have evolved independently in the two animal groups .
Watery smells
“ It looks like the platypus started from the same suite of genes , but did completely different things with them , ” says Graves .
In yet another surprise , the team found that the platypus has a bigger repertoire of a particular class of vomeronasal receptors than any other animal .
This finding suggests that their sense of smell is important while they are foraging under water , says Stewart Nicol , a platypus researcher at the University of Tasmania , Hobart .
“ I do n’t think anybody expected that , ” he says .
The draft genome sequence should also help to end the platypus ’s identity crisis , Graves says .
“ We know it is not the head of a duck stitched onto the tail of a beaver any more – but there was still controversy about where it fitted in , and whether perhaps it was a weird marsupial ” she says .
“ Now , with the whole genome , there is no doubt that it split off the branch that led to both placentals and marsupials .
At last , we can clear about where it fits . ”

Water is the most abundant solid material in space .
Astronomers see it on various planets , on moons , in comets and in interstellar clouds .
But how did it get there ?
Nobody really knows how water could possibly form in the freezing darkness of interstellar space .
At least they did n’t until now .
Today , Akira Kouchi and buddies at the Institute of Low Temperature Science at Hokkaido University in Japan say that have created water for the first in conditions similar to those found in interstellar space .
Water forms quite easily when oxygen and atomic hydrogen meet .
The problem is that there is not enough of it floating around as gas in interstellar dust clouds .
So instead , the thinking is that water must form when atomic hydrogen interacts with frozen solid oxygen on the surface of dust grains in these clouds .
Kouchi and co recreated this process by creating a layer of solid oxygen on an aluminum substrate at 10 K and then bombarding it with hydrogen .
Sure enough , infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of water and hydrogen peroxide , and in the right quantities to explain the abundance of water seen in interstellar clouds .
That ’s cool and in more ways than one .
All the water in the solar system–in comets , on Mars and in the oceans on Earth–must have formed in exactly this way in the interstellar dustcloud which pre-dated Sol and the planets .
So that ’s not just any old water you ’re sipping , that ’s interstellar star juice .

With Friends Like The NRA ...
By L. Neil Smith
Americans today are drowning in an ocean of lies .
Virtually everything they think they know -- about history , about economics , about the Constitution and the law , about a hundred other things -- is wrong .
The shameful truth about the National Rifle Association , for example , is that there seems to be some kind of mutually beneficial -- symbiotic -- relationship between that group , which would like you to believe it was created to protect the Second Amendment right of the people to keep and bear arms , and the agency that enforces federal gun laws , the notorious Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives .
Neither could exist without the other to prop it up .
The BATFE needs the NRA to keep resisting its agenda ( or at least appearing to do so ) so it can whimper to Congress that it needs more money , more manpower , more machinery , and most of all , more leeway with regard to its habitual violations of its victims ' Constitutional rights .
Similarly , the NRA needs the BATFE to frighten its membership with ( not to mention prospective members ) , using the violent and corrupt federal agency as a bogey - man , and its well - known illegal depredations and terror tactics to extract more money from those who foolishly believe the NRA can protect them -- or even has an interest in doing so .
From time to time , both sides go through the motions of holding well - publicized Congressional hearings so that the NRA and its pet politicians can pretend to shock and horror at what BATFE does ( something they must actually hear about on a daily basis ) , when their real purpose is to enhance its evil image as a credible threat to gunowners .
In 1968 , the NRA " signed off " on Thomas Dodd 's Nazi- inspired Gun Control Act , a story of deceit and treachery we 've told here before - as covered in the book " Gateway to Tyranny " .
( JPFO discovered this nasty connection , and that Dodd requested a translation of Hitler 's gun laws from the Library of Congress . )
And never forget how the NRA actually helped resurrect the Brady Bill ( the whole story is told at http://www.rmgo.org/brady.shtml ) -- under which you must now beg for and receive the government 's permission to buy a gun -- after it was considered to be as dead as a doornail in Congress .
The very existence of the BATFE , and therefore everything it does , violates the Second Amendment , and is therefore illegal .
And yet , at http://jpfo.org/pdf/nraletter.pdf
you can see for yourself , in the NRA 's own words , how and why it defends the existence of this criminal gang , and what the more highly principled Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership , has to say about that .
Vin Suprynowicz , columnist and assistant editorial page editor at the Las Vegas Review Journal simply calls the NRA " the world 's oldest and largest gun control organization " .
While it often calls publically for BATFE reforms ( that turn out to be empty rhetoric because the agency 's value as an NRA fundraising device must never be compromised ) , the NRA has never called for -- and will never call for -- abolition of this unconstitutional agency , repeal of the tangled mass of unconstitutional laws it enforces , or even such badly - needed interim reforms as standardized , published firearms testing procedures , and fully recorded tests , accessible to public review , crucial issues over which perfectly innocent , law - abiding Americans are presently wasting huge chunks of their lives in prison .
Read that letter again : http://jpfo.org/pdf/nraletter.pdf and see the terrible truth .
The NRA does n't care at all about the Second Amendment , the Constitution , the rights and safety of its members , or even the individuals rotting in jail thanks the NRA indifference and inaction .
All the NRA cares about is membership money , tax - free contributions , expensive advertising in its magazines from cowardly , compromising corporations ( as opposed to smaller gunmakers who truly believe in the Second Amendment ) , benefits packages and " golden parachutes " for its executives , and its obscene relationship with the BATFE .
And now Thomas Jefferson 's " long train of abuses and usurpations " -- it 's an express , these days -- has blasted past yet another set of warning signals .
The latest in the NRA 's seemingly endless catalog of insults and injuries to gun owners and to the Bill of Rights in general occurred when a concerned individual wrote to them about a court case in which an extremely dangerous precedent has recently been set .
The concerned individual was Len Savage , gun designer , firearms expert witness , and the proprietor of Historic Arms LLC .
What he said was :
" Yesterday the government ... redefined what a machine gun is : any firearm that malfunctions and fires more than one round before jamming . "
[ The court case in which this happened is US v. Olofson ; trial transcipts are now available at http://jpfo.org/pdf02/olofson-trial-tran-2-0f-3.pdf and http://jpfo.org/pdf02/olofson-trial-tran-3-0f-3.pdf.
You may also want to listen to Len Savage discussing related legal issues on " Talkin ' to America " ] .
" Judge Clevert ( I am told ) stated that it does not matter what ammunition , or what error rate ATF testing has , or that a malfunction occurred , or even if it required ATF to modify the firearm , just that more than one round be fired per function of the trigger .
" Every firearm in possession of your membership is a ' machine gun ' under this narrow interpretation .
This is scientific fact , not my opinion .
For example :
* A double barrel shotgun firing both barrels with a single trigger pull ;
* A Colt single action loaded with thin - primer ammo ( the pierced primer will ' fan ' the hammer with gas pressure ) .
Look up Georgia machine gun statute , they exempted it by stating a machine gun must fire more than 6 shots per function of the trigger ;
* The ATF Firearms Technology Branch can test a rifle 100 different times ; if they can manipulate it just once out of 100 , you 're indicted .
" The NRA 's Jason Ouimet has been aware of this situation at ATF since before the congressional hearings on ' the Virginia gun show incident ' .
I was supposed to testify at the hearings about the ATF testing issues at that time .
Much to my frustration , the hearing I was supposed to testify at was canceled .
According to Jason , it was [ the ] NRA who pulled the plug on me .
" Now that the whole of the NRA membership is in jeopardy just by owning a firearm , [ are ]
Wayne LaPierre , Chris Cox , and the NRA board going to do something about this during this week 's convention ?
" Please pass this on to them :
* Words will not be sufficient .
If this gets " unplugged " , [ if ] the NRA refuses to address this issue , I will [ have ] no choice but to go to the media with documents and e-mails from [ the ] NRA that were generated during the last round of hearings .
I will pull back the rug and show the world where [ the ] NRA swept this mess under [ it ] to hide it .
" Please forgive my abrupt and obtuse attitude .
It is born of frustration [ with the ] deaf ears of the NRA leadership .
I am there if I can to help the NRA , thus to date the NRA have refused to address this .
" My question to NRA leadership :
" Is this weekend 's convention going to be your finest hour , or will this be noted in history as the beginning of the end of the NRA ?
" Respectfully ,
" Len Savage " Historic Arms LLC "
Len 's letter was answered by somebody named Jason Ouimet ( be sure to write to him at JOuimet@nrahq.org -- for as long as that e-mail address remains good ) described as the NRA " federal liaison " :
" Len , " You sent me an email not long ago titled ' olive branch ' where you indicated that you wanted to be able to have an open dialogue with me and keep me posted on relevant firearms , issues , cases , etc. and I agreed .
However , in this email you took a nasty , blatantly FALSE swipe at me and the NRA , and sent it to other people I do n't even know .
So from this point forward consider our relationship terminated .
Do not call or email me again in the future .
" Jason "
Again , Ouimet 's address is JOuimet@nrahq.org -- until he changes it .
Len wrote back :
" Jason ,
" Swipe ?
" By the way those ' unknown people ' are on the NRA legislative action committee .
As a Federal liaison you do n't know them ?
" Cut the crap , Jason , when is the last time you took my calls or answered a voice mail to call me back ?
" Len Savage
Clearly , this desk - warming , chair - polishing flunky needs to be reminded of his proper place in the scheme of things .
Every gun owner -- this means you -- is in grave danger as a result of this ruling , which makes it extremely risky even to get caught taking a broken gun to a gunsmith for repair .
He is not permitted to treat the individuals who write to him -- especially those who are attempting to help him -- like unruly peasants being disrespectful to their feudal Lord and Master .
At least not yet .
I disagree with Len Savage about " the beginning of the end of the NRA " .
Their future looks pretty darned sunshiny to me .
High on the list of Things I Know But Cannot Prove is that this court ruling -- which we'd otherwise be inclined to dismiss as insane or corrupt -- is deliberately intended to achieve a larger purpose .
If any gun can suddenly and mysteriously become a machinegun , then new regulations will be required to force gun owners to bring their guns in for an annual inspection to make sure they have n't been up to no good .
And when these annual inspections , to make sure your single action sixgun has n't mutated into a machinegun , exhaust the resources of the BATFE , you can bet the inspection will wind up being done by bright - eyed and bushy - tailled volunteers from the NRA .
Just as when our guns all have to be stowed in lockers at the local gun club we 're required to become members of , they 'll be NRA lockers at an NRA - sanctioned club .
What can be done ?
At this stage , plenty .
CNN 's Lou Dobbs has been covering this mess .
Catch up with the latest by Googling him and Olofson .
Then write thanking him for his principled stance on this issue .
Learn who your representative on the NRA board of directors is and write to him or her demanding the same kind of principled behavior -- and , of course , that Jason Ouimet be fired .
Copy the entire NRA leadership .
Make everything you send to them an open letter and , together with whatever reply you get , spam it out as far and wide as possible .
Perhaps you 'd even like to take these issues up with the NRA 's leadership in person , at their 137th Annual " Meetings and Exhibits " in Louisville , Kentucky , but you 'll have to hurry -- the event begins May 16th .
See http://www.nraam.org
Stop feeding the fraud .
If you 're an annual NRA member , or your membership is up for renewal , withhold your money until the vile , corrupt collusion between the NRA and the BATFE , this disgusting mutual love - fest -- and the dire consequences it has for every gun owner -- comes to an end .
Make no more contributions until the NRA stops making excuses and the BATFE is abolished .
Work to remove any board member who does not actively strive to abolish the BATFE .
Demand that they stop endorsing politicians who are not true Second Amendment supporters .
If you want to help abolish the BATFE yourself , get a copy of The Gang http://www.thegangmovie.com/, the JPFO documentary exposing its long history of irresponsible , malicious , and criminal action .
Study it , show it to your friends , at gun club and other meetings .
Likewise , at http://shop.jpfo.org/cart.php?m=product_detail&p=8, the message of Innocents Betrayed encourages a greater understanding of how evil " gun control " -- and the acts of genocide it makes possible -- truly is .
Learn how governments have historically deprived their own people of firearms -- and then wiped them from the face of the earth .
Undoubtedly the most effective way , in the long run , to deal with entities like the BATFE is a program we call " Take Your Money Back " which will abolish the federal income tax and federal regulatory agencies would be defunded .
( Watch the " Take Your Money Back " video - bottom of this page ) .
The obvious place to start is with those agencies that -- like the BATFE -- are a violation of the Constitution .
Finally , as an NRA Life member for the past 35 years , I find that I have several membership cards that have been practically screaming to be ceremonially burned for the benefit of YouTube .
I can only imagine -- and savor -- the reactions by various segments of the press and public ( not to mention the NRA ) if I am joined by even a hundred other angry NRA members , let alone perhaps thousands or tens of thousands .
Watch who steps forward to defends this incestuous NRA / BATFE affair .
They are neither your friends , nor friends of the Second Amendment .
Could be it's time for a little of that revolution Jefferson wrote about .

SAN ANGELO , Texas ( CNN ) --
The Texas branch of the American Civil Liberties Union said it was concerned that the basic rights of the children and mothers connected to a Texas polygamist ranch were violated during a recent raid and custody hearing .
At the hearing Friday , Judge Barbara Walther ordered 416 children connected to the YFZ ( Yearning For Zion ) ranch kept in state custody .
Walther made her ruling after two days of testimony at the hearing , which was aimed at determining whether child welfare authorities properly removed the children from the sect 's Texas ranch .
The judge said she found sufficient evidence for Texas Child Protective Services to retain custody of the children .
The ACLU said it had a representative at the court hearing and the organization was concerned about human rights violations .
" While we acknowledge that Judge Walther 's task may be unprecedented in Texas judicial history , we question whether the current proceedings adequately protect the fundamental rights of the mothers and children , " Terri Burke , executive director of the ACLU of Texas , said in a written statement .
" As this situation continues to unfold , we are concerned that the constitutional rights that all Americans rely upon and cherish -- that we are secure in our homes , that we may worship as we please and hold our places of worship sacred , and that we may be with our children absent evidence of imminent danger -- have been threatened , " Burke said .
The group 's courtroom observer , Lisa Graybill , added : " We recognize that this balancing act is difficult , but we are concerned that government may not be complying with the Constitution or the laws of Texas in the execution of its mandate , from how the raids were conducted to whether the current process protects basic rights . "
The ACLU statement did not list any specific instances of human rights or constitutional violations , and ACLU representatives did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
Child Protective Services spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said her department is in the process of finding " temporary placement " for all the children .
" What we did was warranted and in the best interest of the children , " she said .
" This is not about religion -- this is about keeping children safe from abuse . "
The hearing stems from an April 4 raid of the ranch , which authorities said was triggered by phone calls in late March from a 16 - year - old officials referred to as Sarah .
The caller said she had been beaten and forced to become a man's " spiritual " wife .
On Thursday , child protection supervisor Angie Voss testified that she and other investigators encountered several pregnant teenagers at the YFZ ranch , which is in Eldorado , Texas , about 40 miles outside San Angelo .
The girls called each other " sister wives , " Voss said , and believed it was acceptable to be " spiritually united " with a man at any age .
" It was the belief that no age was too young to be married , " she said .
Members of the ranch have denied the girl , supposedly named Sarah Jessop Barlow , exists , and authorities have yet to find the caller .
However , Texas Rangers are pursuing a Colorado woman as a " person of interest " regarding the phone calls that touched off the raid .
Authorities on Friday said a search of Rozita Swinton 's home in Colorado Springs resulted in evidence that possibly links her to phone calls made about the YFZ ranch .
Swinton , 33 , has been charged in Colorado with false reporting to authorities , but police said that the arrest was not directly related to the Texas case .

Mr Olmert has previously said he will not step down Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak has called on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to take a leave of absence or resign as he battles allegations of corruption .
Mr Barak said he would take his Labour Party out of Mr Olmert 's governing coalition if he did not step down .
" The prime minister needs to disconnect himself from the day - to - day management of the government , " Mr Barak said .
Mr Olmert denies claims that he took up to $ 500,000 ( £ 250,000 ) in bribes or illegal campaign donations .
Mr Olmert , the head of the Kadima party , admits accepting funds before he became prime minister in 2006 .
But he insists they were legal contributions towards his campaigns for re-election as Jerusalem mayor and for the leadership of the Likud party .
I do not think the prime minister can simultaneously run the government and deal with his own personal affair
Ehud Barak
Israeli Defence Minister
He has previously said he had no plans to step aside unless he is charged .
Kadima has just 29 MPs out of a total of 120 seats in the Knesset , and relies on the Labour Party 's 19 MPs as key allies in its governing coalition .
Mr Barak 's resignation call is a very damaging blow to Mr Olmert , the BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem says .
Most seasoned political analysts in Israel believe it spells his certain demise as prime minister , our Middle East correspondent says .
Barak 's warning Mr Barak was speaking a day after the US businessman at the centre of the allegations told investigators that he gave Mr Olmert envelopes full of cash .
ISRAELI KNESSET Kadima : 29 MPs Labour : 19 MPs Shas : 12 MPs Likud : 12 MPs Yisrael Beiteinu : 11 MPs Others : 37 MPs Morris Talansky was questioned by investigators , and is due to be cross-examined by Mr Olmert 's defence team in July .
At a press conference on Wednesday , Mr Barak said he did not think the prime minister could run the government and deal with the fall - out from the allegations at the same time .
" He can do this in any of the ways open to him - suspension , vacation or resignation or declaring himself incapacitated .
We will not be the ones to determine this , " he said .
But he warned that if Mr Olmert did not leave , " we will act towards setting an agreed and early date for elections " .
However , our correspondent notes that Mr Barak did not issue an ultimatum with a precise deadline attached .
Italian holiday Testifying in an Israeli court on Tuesday , Mr Talansky said he handed over about $ 150,000 of his own money to Mr Olmert , directly and through aides , over a 15 - year period .
Mr Talansky said the money was often handed over in cash - stuffed envelopes
The rest of the money came from fundraising .
He said he did not know how the money had been spent , adding : " I only know he loved expensive cigars .
I know he loved pens , watches . "
Mr Talansky said that Mr Olmert also asked him for a personal loan of $ 25,000 - $ 30,000 for a holiday in Italy .
In another case , he said , he walked to a bank to withdraw $ 15,000 in cash for a loan as Mr Olmert waited in a luxury hotel .
Mr Talansky said he thought Mr Olmert 's " word was gold " , but that Mr Olmert never repaid either loan .

What are these ?
A decade after approving the Lasik laser eye procedure for vision correction , federal health officials moved Friday to explore potential risks in what ’s become one of the country ’s most popular surgeries .
Almost 8 million Americans have had the procedure , and most ended up discarding their eyeglasses or contact lenses without long - term complications , according to doctors and health officials .
But a small fraction complain of serious side effects that have left their eyes painfully dry and their vision marred by ghostly shadows or starbursts of color .
Some say their sight is so poor they ca n’t watch a movie or drive at night .
Now the Food and Drug Administration plans to launch a national study assessing the rate of side effects among Lasik patients .
Agency officials , who held an all - day hearing as a first step to examining the problem , also intend to look into whether prospective patients need more and better information about the risks .
“ The technology has evolved -- it ’s gotten better ; it ’s safer -- but we still have a percentage of patients who are having unsatisfactory results , ” said Dr. Daniel G. Schultz , director of the FDA ’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health .
“ Now it ’s a question of whether there are concrete steps the FDA can take to minimize the number of people who are having these bad experiences . ”

Americans have flocked to Lasik since its approval in 1998 .
Patients , who each pay from several hundred to several thousand dollars for the surgery , spend $ 2.5 billion a year , according to industry analyst Market Scope .
Customers are attracted to the quick recovery times and the prospect of experiencing little pain afterward .
But the surgery is n’t for everyone , and there can be complications , such as impaired night vision .
From 1998 to 2006 , the FDA received 140 reports of serious side effects .
Early this year , the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery , which represents Lasik physicians , reviewed almost 3,000 journal articles on Lasik and found that 95 % of patients reported satisfaction with the outcome of their surgery .
Dr. Kerry Solomon , a Charleston , S.C. , eye surgeon who led the association review , expressed support for a national study but said there was no need to rewrite the warning information because doctors are careful to inform patients about potential problems .

In his practice at the Medical University of South Carolina ’s Storm Eye Institute , Solomon said he spends two hours briefing a prospective patient on the risks and testing their eyes to make sure the operation has a high chance of success .
Based on the results , Solomon said , he turns away every fourth patient .
Dr. Walter J. Stark , director of cataract and cornea services at Johns Hopkins ’ Wilmer Eye Institute , agrees that doctors must take time to make sure patients have realistic expectations .
Chances for night glare and other side effects have been reduced , he said , but he still stresses there ’s a 1 % risk of serious side effects .
Although doctors need to do a better job reporting cases of adverse events , Stark said , the most important step the government and medical profession could take is to curb marketing hype .
“ It is important that doctors not trivialize the procedure .
Sometimes , advertisements trivialize it .
They say it ’s bladeless , it ’s not really cutting ; but it ’s still a cut in the eye , ” he said .
The FDA ’s Schultz said in an interview that some Lasik promotions were misleading .
“ Frankly , some of the marketing that has been done with respect to Lasik makes it sound like you go to the grocery store and you come out and see perfectly .
That ’s not good .
This is real surgery , ” he said .
PANTHEISM
Scientific Pantheism :
Reverence of Nature and Cosmos
Carl Sagan , Pale Blue Dot ( 1994 )
A religion old or new , that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science , might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths .
Sooner or later , such a religion will emerge .
Are You a Scientific Pantheist ?
When you look at the night sky or at the images of the Hubble Space Telescope , are you filled with feelings of awe and wonder at the overwhelming beauty and power of the universe ?
When you are in the midst of nature , in a forest , by the sea , on a mountain peak - do you ever feel a sense of the sacred , like the feeling of being in a vast cathedral ?
Do you believe that humans should be a part of Nature , rather than set above it ?
If you can answer yes to all of these questions , then you have pantheistic leanings .
Are you sceptical about a " God " other than Nature and the wider Universe , yet feel an emotional need for a recognition of something greater than your own self or than the human race ?
If so , then scientific pantheism is very probably your natural philosophical or spiritual home .
Pantheism is older than Buddhism or Christianity , and may already count hundreds of millions among its members .
Many atheists and humanists may be scientific pantheists without realizing it .
Scientific pantheism is a modern form of pantheism that deeply reveres the universe and nature and joyfully accepts and embraces life , the body and earth , but does not believe in any supernatural deities , entities or powers .
What Pantheism believes
At the heart of pantheism is reverence of the universe as the ultimate focus of reverence , and for the natural earth as sacred .
Scientific Pantheism - SciPan for short - has a naturalistic approach which simply accepts and reveres the universe and nature just as they are , and promotes an ethic of respect for human and animal rights and for lifestyles that sustain rather than destroy the environment .
When scientific pantheists say WE REVERE THE UNIVERSE we are not talking about a supernatural being .
We are talking about the way our senses and our emotions force us to respond to the overwhelming mystery and power that surrounds us .
We are part of the universe .
Our earth was created from the universe and will one day be reabsorbed into the universe .
We are made of the same matter and energy as the universe .
We are not in exile here : we are at home .
It is only here that we will ever get the chance to see paradise face to face .
If we believe our real home is not here but in a land that lies beyond death - if we believe that the numinous is found only in old books , or old buildings , or inside our head , or outside this reality - then we will see this real , vibrant , luminous world as if through a glass darkly .
The universe creates us , preserves us , destroys us .
It is deep and old beyond our ability to reach with our senses .
It is beautiful beyond our ability to describe in words .
It is complex beyond our ability to fully grasp in science .
We must relate to the universe with humility , awe , reverence , celebration and the search for deeper understanding - in many of the ways that believers relate to their God , minus the grovelling worship or the expectation that there is some being out there who can answer our prayers .
This overwhelming presence is everywhere inside you and outside you and you can never be separated from it .
Whatever else is taken from you , this can never be taken from you .
Wherever you are , it 's there with you .
Wherever you go , it goes with you .
Whatever happens to you , it remains with you .
When pantheists say WE REVERE AND CARE FOR NATURE , we mean it with just as much commitment and reverence as believers speaking about their church or mosque , or the relics of their saints .
But again we are not talking about supernatural beings .
We are saying this :
We are part of nature .
Nature made us and at our death we will be reabsorbed into nature .
We are at home in nature and in our bodies .
This is where we belong .
This is the only place where we can find and make our paradise , not in some imaginary world on the other side of the grave .
If nature is the only paradise , then separation from nature is the only hell .
When we destroy nature , we create hell on earth for other species and for ourselves .
Nature is our mother , our home , our security , our peace , our past and our future .
We should treat natural things and habitats as believers treat their temples and shrines , as sacred - to be revered and preserved in all their intricate and fragile beauty .

A positive approach to life on earth .
Scientific Pantheism offers the most positive and embracing approach to life , the body and nature of any philosophy or religion .
Our bodies are not base and evil : they are good .
Nature is not a reflection of something higher : it is the highest .
Life is not a path to somewhere else : it is the destination .
We must make the best of while we have it .
Scientific Pantheism is rooted in the present world .
It reconciles concern for humans , and concern for the planet .
It places life , not death , in the focus of our concern .
Scientific Pantheism has as its central motto :
Healthy mind
Pantheism fosters a mind that accepts the world : a mind alert to vibrant reality , in touch with the senses , receptive to the energy of the body and the universe .
A mind fully awake to nature , open to new knowledge , responsive to the beauty of the natural world .
Pantheism fosters a mind that accepts life , the body , and the self : a mind that is free from guilt about original sin or inability to be a martyr ; free of anxiety about death or the possibility of eternal punishment beyond death .
Pantheism fosters a sane and whole mind that respects reason and evidence , that will not accept key beliefs without rational basis , simply on the claims of ancient scripture or the assertion of gurus .
Pantheism demands no faith in impossible events and secret revelations .
Pantheism satisfies our need to revere something greater than ourselves - yet never turns its back on the earth , and never departs from the evidence before us .
Pantheism fuses spirituality and science , mind and body , humans and nature .
Healthy body
Transcendental religions - especially primitive Christianity and Theravada Buddhism - have a negative attitude to the body .
The body is seen as a temporary container for the soul , or as a disgusting bag of foul substances .
Pantheism has a totally positive attitude .
The body is natural and is sacred like every other part of nature .
Its pleasures are good and not evi , as long as they are pursued without harm to one 's health , to other humans or to nature .
Looking after the body , preserving its health and fitness through a healthy diet and exercise , are things we can and should do without slinking feelings of guilt .
Healthy earth
For transcendental religions the whole earth , like the body , is merely a temporary stage which will be destroyed before the Last Judgement , or will vanish when we realize that it is mere illusion .
But this earth is not a staging post and it is not an illusion .
Pantheism affirms the earth and upholds nature as the most sacred temples .
Concern for the health of the earth is not just a matter of human survival , not just a matter of preserving diversity and wilderness for our enjoyment .
It is a primary spiritual and ethical duty .

A spiritual approach in keeping with the age of science and environment
On the eve of the Third Millennium we have become citizens of the cosmos .
Through the eyes of the Hubble telescope we have seen the universe as never before .
We have seen the emptiness of space strewn with galaxies as thick as snow .
We have seen the birth of stars .
We have found planetary discs around many stars .
We have found amino acids in space .
In this situation it is becoming impossible to believe in gods other than the Universe itself , or gods who created this ungraspable immensity just as a frame for our tiny presence .
During this same generation we have lost our citizenship of this earth , and risk losing our delicate foothold in the cosmos .
We have acquired the power to modify life , to alter ecosystems , to change the planet itself and threaten the future of every species , including our own .
Today we need a spiritual approach that provide powerful backing for environmental action .
Yet the three largest Western religions provide only feeble support .
In this generation spirituality must come of age and be reborn into the age of space , the age of science , the age of environment .

Pantheist Practice : Living and celebrating
Remember : They Are Liars

t r u t h o u t – Columnist
No one is such a liar as the indignant man .
– Friedrich Nietzsche
George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , Condoleezza Rice , along with a slew of administration underlings and a revolving - door cavalcade of brass hats from the Pentagon , have been making claims regarding Iraq for many years now .
They claimed Iraq was in possession of 26,000 liters of anthrax , “ enough to kill several million people , ” according to a page on the White House web site titled Disarm Saddam Hussein .
They lied .
They claimed Iraq was in possession of 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin .
They lied .
They claimed Iraq was in possession of 500 tons , which equals 1,000,000 pounds , of sarin , mustard and VX nerve agent .
They lied .
They claimed Iraq was in possession of nearly 30,000 munitions capable of delivering these agents .
They lied .
They claimed Iraq was in possession of several mobile biological weapons labs .
They lied .
They claimed Iraq was operating an " advanced " nuclear weapons program .
They lied .
They claimed Iraq had been seeking " significant quantities " of uranium from Africa for use in this " advanced " nuclear weapons program .
They lied .
They claimed Iraq attempted to purchase high - strength aluminum tubes " suitable for nuclear weapons . "
They lied .
They claimed America needed to invade , overthrow and occupy Iraq in order to remove this menace from our world .
" It would take just one vial , one canister , one crate slipped into this country , " went the White House line , " to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known . "
They lied .
" Simply stated , " said Dick Cheney in August of 2002 , " there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction . "
Liar .
" Right now , " said George W. Bush in September of 2002 , " Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of nuclear weapons . "
Liar .
" We know for a fact , " said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer in January of 2003 , " that there are weapons there . "
Liar .
" We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction , " said Colin Powell in February of 2003 , " is determined to make more . "
Liar .
" We know where they are , " said Donald Rumsfeld in March of 2003 .
" They are in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad , and east , south , west and north somewhat . "
Liar .
" The Iraqi people understand what this crisis is about , " said Paul Wolfowitz in March of 2003 .
" Like the people of France in the 1940s , they view us as their hoped - for liberator . "
Liar .
" No one ever said that we knew precisely where all of these agents were , " said Condoleezza Rice in June of 2003 , " where they were stored . "
Liar .
" I have absolute confidence that there are weapons of mass destruction inside this country , " said Gen. Tommy Franks in April of 2003 .
" Whether we will turn out , at the end of the day , to find them in one of the 2,000 or 3,000 sites we already know about or whether contact with one of these officials who we may come in contact with will tell us , ' Oh , well , there 's actually another site , ' and we 'll find it there , I 'm not sure . "
Wrong .
" Before the war , " said Gen. Michael Hagee in May of 2003 , " there 's no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , biological and chemical .
I expected them to be found .
I still expect them to be found . "
Wrong .
" Given time , " said Gen. Richard Myers in May of 2003 , " given the number of prisoners now that we 're interrogating , I 'm confident that we 're going to find weapons of mass destruction . "
Wrong .
" Do I think we 're going to find something ?
Yeah , I kind of do , " said Maj .
Gen. Keith Dayton in May of 2003 , " because I think there 's a lot of information out there . "
Wrong .
Gen . David Petraeus , commander of US forces in Iraq , is about to give testimony before the Senate regarding the current state of affairs in that battle - savaged country .
He is a political general , one of many America has seen and heard over the last five years , one who would leap nude from the Capitol dome before telling the real truth about matters in Iraq ... or who would speak using words fed to him by liars , and thus be wrong .
Remember : they lie .
They all lie , from the top man down to the bottom .
If their lips are moving , a lie is unfolding .
If they say water is wet , get into the shower to make sure .
They lie .
Period .

Asus ’ Eee PC has become a low - cost laptop to reckon with .
Everex has snuck up on the low - cost leader with the CloudBook , and other vendors are rumored to be releasing their own low - cost notebooks in the near future .
Will Asus be able to maintain its lead in the market and not just be remembered for pioneering mainstream low - cost computing ?
Asus CEO Jerry
Shen seems to think so and in fact has lots of plans up his sleeve for the triple - E machine .
In our hour - long interview , Shen shared that the Eee PC will get :
A 8.9 - inch display and Windows XP : Confirming that the machine shown at CeBIT will come to market in April , the new Eee PC will have a 8.9 - inch screen and a higher 1024 x 600 - pixel resolution An 8GB SSD will be available running Windows XP .
A 12GB or 20 GB SSD model will be available with Xandros .

More Colors and Stylish Looks :
In May or June , Asus will release “ very stylish ” versions of the Eee PC .
Shen says they will have a New York City sleekness .
Shen thinks the days of the Eee PC are just taking off ( and his response to the first question in the interview below affirms that ) and that the competitors will try to knock them off their course but wo n’t succeed .
Not his words exactly , but read the full interview to find out more .
Asus sold more than 350,000 Eee PCs in the fourth quarter .
Have you been surprised by its success and can you share how well it ’s doing now ?
It definitely exceeded our expectations .
Originally I hoped it would be around 200,000 , so we definitely went above that .
In the past few months we have increased sales by 30 to 40 percent ; I think shipments will soon total around 700,000 .
The demand is so strong , especially in Japan and Europe .
But there is now a huge shortage of batteries .
I just returned from CeBIT and all the customers were requesting more and more .
The supply issue is now becoming a serious issue .
Do you think it will delay production and bringing the product to market ?
The battery , unfortunately , will remain an issue , but I think we can solve the battery issue by May .
In Europe if we can supply the batteries , the sales of the machines will go up to 300,000 or 400,000 per month .
What do you think Asus got right with the first model and what could you have done better ?
Actually when we sold the first model a lot of users started suggesting an adjustment of the screen size .
The current screen size of 7 inches is too small and the resolution of 800 x 480 is too small .
We have taken suggestions from the users .
But actually 70 percent of the users in Taiwan are satisfied with the machine .
But we have to decided to make the changes and provide a bigger machine with bigger screen sizes and more storage .
We are actually able to keep the machine the same size , but move the speakers from the side to the bottom of the machine to extend the screen size .
Beyond the screen , how will the new machines be different ?
The screen size will be 8.9 inches .
And the storage , which was originally 4GB , will be upgraded to versions with an 8 GB solid state drive and a 12 to 20 GB solid state drives .
We are n’t sure yet if the second machine will be 12 or 20 GB because of guidelines we have to follow .
The 8GB machine will run Windows XP and the 12 or the 20 GB will be Linux based .
The Windows XP machine will have 1GB of RAM .
The screen resolution on each of these will be 1024 x 600 .
All these models will have solid state drives , not hard drives ?
We are looking at an option to provide hard drives .
In June and April we will only support solid state drives .
Hard drives will be options at a later date .
Any information on the pricing on the new 8.9 - inch model ?
In the beginning and in April , around the release date , it will initially be higher and be around $ 499 in the United States .
From the user feedback , I think if we provide a bigger screen and bigger storage it may be more popular than the 7 - inch version .
The second generation is very important for us .
Do you think that by increasing the size of the notebook and making it a bit more expensive it will be difficult to be in a market against notebooks that are more powerful but that have a similar price ?
I think this is the initial price .
I believe in June the market will decide the price and it can drop down .
I also think its small size will really attract people .
It will continue to be a solid second PC choice or the PC that is good for kids .
Will you be sticking with the Xandros operating system for future Eee PCs that are n’t running Windows ?
I think most of the people are demanding a form of Windows , but others appreciate the Linux .
We will stick with both and we will continue to work with Xandros for the Linux operating system .
Will you be adding mobile broadband to future Eee PCs ?
You recently announced that Mobile WiMAX versions of the Eee PC would be coming later this year .
Do you feel like that is still on track given problems Sprint is having getting necessary funding to launch its network ?
I think the Eee PC is all about mobility , and the Internet experience when you are outside is so important on the device .
WiMAX and HSDPA built - in will be a goal for us .
I think these kinds of features will be out in Q3 2008 .
We have the module for HSDPA and a lot of carriers and telecoms could take advantage of this .
We will put the module in the machines when our partnerships with Telecoms are in place .
For WiMAX we are waiting for the maturity of this connection .
We will put the WiMAX in when it ’s ready but will be aiming to have both by Q3 .
Will you incorporate Intel ’s Diamondville processor ( now Atom ) or consider VIA ’s Isaiah ’s processor ?
Which do you think will be integrated ?
From my view point , Diamondville is the better choice , because it uses the 45 - namometer processor .
And pricewise it is very competitive .
In my planning I will continue to use Intel ’s Diamondville .
And for the VIA one I think from the power point of view , Diamondville is still better .
In May , these machines will be hitting the market .
Do you plan to stick with the color options you have now on future Eee PCs or go with a different set of colors ?
Actually that is a big focus .
In my planning , in May and June we will release very stylish colors and I think more than five color options .
I think the colors will really reflect the New York City and London city style .
It ’s a very flashy look and one will look more oriental and one more Western .
There will be a very new color design introduced in June , but I ca n’t disclose more at this time .
But you will be very surprised .
What accessories will become available for the Eee PC and what is the timetable for their release ?
In May we will try to provide storage for the Eee PC .
If you buy the Eee PC , you will have additional Web storage ; we are thinking 10 GB storage .
Web storage is very different from local storage and we want to start to experiment with that .
Another accessory that we are trying to implement is handwriting tools , like a tablet but it would be an accessory .
I think also Skype phones and VoIP phones .
You will start to see more TV tuners as well .
One of the most innovative features of the Eee PC is the that it does n’t use a power brick .
How did you manage to avoid using a power brick , and will future Eee PCs continue to be brickless ?
Yes , our new adapter is even smaller and the charge time will be very short .
We are trying to provide this new adapter in the beginning of April .
It will be available with the 7 - and 8.9 - inch models .
The charging time will be much shorter .
In the near future , we also are trying to support one - day computing which would provide more than 8 hours .
I think in May we might be closer to providing that .
Everex has come out with the CloudBook and there are rumors that HP and Acer will be launching their own low - cost laptop soon .
Are you nervous about this competition , and how do you intend to keep Asus at the top of this fast - growing market ?
We expected company from HP and Acer .
In the beginning of April we will be releasing the 8.9 - inch and then May and June we will provide another feature for each one .
I am proud of my team and the speed in which they can bring things to market .
One of our big advantages is that we have people that can do things very quickly .
I think if you look at our speed and our features we have a lot of strength there .
HP and Acer are very good at providing strong feature sets and both companies have their strengths , but we will be able to play in the race .
We have a lot of innovation and we implement those innovations .
Innovation in the style and the electronics will let us keep up with our competitors .
Are you concerned that this so - called race to the bottom in terms of pricing will cannibalize the sales of your other notebooks ?
How is the Eee PC transforming the notebook business ?
I think if we continue to use the smaller sizes with the smaller screens we will be okay .
What I have heard from the market competitors is that they would like to increase the size of the screen in low - cost notebooks .
I think that will hurt us and them .
From Asus ’ point of view for the Eee PC , we will keep the smaller size .
I plan to keep it at 8.9 or even at 10 inches .
I think we are handling it very carefully .
I think companies who do n’t do this will actually hurt themselves .

Postscript :
In addition to mental health professionals , the following highly - credible people question the government 's version of 9/11 :
And should you think that questioning 9/11 shows political or religious bias , take a look
at
how broad the coalition is questioning 9/11 :
Should people who question the government 's version of the events of 9/11 have their heads examined ?
Well , the following psychiatrists and psychologists have concluded that the official version of 9/11 is false .
Moreover , many of these mental health experts have concluded that the government 's account is sofalse that people who believe the government 's version are in psychological denial : Psychiatrist Carol S. Wolman , MD Psychiatrist E. Martin Schotz Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences , Duke University Medical Center , as well as Radiology , at Duke University Medical Center D. Lawrence Burk , Jr. , MD Board of Governors Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology and Associate Dean of the Graduate School at Rutgers University Barry R. Komisaruk Professor of Psychology at University of New Hampshire William Woodward Professor of Psychology at University of Essex Philip Cozzolino Professor of Psychology at Goddard College Catherine Lowther Professor Emeritus of Psychology at California Institute of Integral Studies Ralph Metzner Professor of Psychology at Rhodes University Mike Earl - Taylor Retired Professor of Psychology at Oxford University Graham Harris Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Nebraska and licensed Psychologist Ronald Feintech Ph.D. Clinical Neuropsychologist Richard Welser Clinical psychologist , Ed.D. , Harvard University , Gwendolyn Atwood Psychology researcher , M.A. , Psychology Victoria Ashley Psychotherapist , M.S. Clinical Psychology , Greg Henricks M.S. in educational psychology , Roy Holcombe M.A. in Counseling Psychology Tova Gabrielle
There are literally thousands of other mental health professionals who have reached the same conclusions .
So who is out of touch with reality : those who question 9/11 or those who believe the government 's version without question ?
Washington Times mocks ' Bush the bee killer ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday May 19 , 2008

Print This Email This When NBC's Richard Engel interviewed Pesident George W. Bush in Egypt during his largely unproductive Mid-East tour , Bush for the most part confined his remarks to repeating well - established positions on Iran and the Middle East .
However , Bush did respond with one interesting new metaphor when Engel suggested , " Many people say that [ the war on terror ] has not made the world safer , that it has created more radicals , that there are more people in this part of the world who want to attack the United States . "
" This is the beehive theory , " Bush replied .
" You should have just let the beehive sit there and hope the bees do n't come out of the hive . "
" Have n't you just smashed the bees ' hive and let them spread ? "
Engel asked .
" To suggest that bees would stay in their hive is naive , " Bush replied .
" They did n't stay in the hive when they came and killed 3000 of our citizens . "
In an item headed , " Bush the bee killer , " the conservative Washington Times called this an " odd exchange " and suggested that " apparently Bin Laden is the queen bee , " implying that Bush 's bee - killing has been ineffective .
An unverified audio message purporting to be from bin Laden was posted online by Islamic militants on Sunday .
It called on Muslims to fight their own governments in support of Palestine .
The beehive metaphor has most commonly been used by critics of Bush 's policies .
As early as May 2003 , terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna was comparing al Qaeda to a beehive that had been kicked , telling Reuters , " If you attack it what happens ?
The bees are dispersing and they are finding new queens . "
The metaphor was also used in 2004 by then - presidential candidate John Kerry , who charged that , " the triumphalism of this administration .... about al - Qaeda on the run has really exceeded reality .
What 's happened is we broke the beehive , but we did n't kill the bees and we certainly have n't killed the queen bee . "
The Times further noted that Bush " brings back bad memories of Joaquin Phoenix in his creepy role as a Roman emperor in ' Gladiator . ' "
In that movie , the emperor tells a story about the conspirators against his predecessor , the Emperor Claudius , calling them " busy little bees " whose plots were foiled when Claudius said to one of them , " Tell me what you 've been doing busy little bee or I shall strike down those dearest to you .
You shall watch as I bathe in their blood . "

If you look back over the last several years , the middle east that you 'll be handing over to the next president is deeply problematic .
You have Hamas in power , Hezbollah empowered , taking to the streets , iran empowered , Iraq still at war .
What region are you handing over ?
BUSH : Richard , those folks were always around .
They were here .
What we 're handing over is a Middle East that one recognizes the problems and the world recognizes them .
There 's clarity as to what the problems are .
ENGEL : The war on terrorism has been the centerpiece of your presidency .
Many people say that it has not made the world safer , that it has created more radicals , that there are more people in this part of the world who want to attack the United States .
BUSH : It 's just a beehive theory .
We should have just let the beehive sit there and hope the bees do n't come out of the hive ?
My attitude is , the United States must stay on the offense against al qaeda two ways -- ENGEL : Smash the beehive and let them spread ?
BUSH : Richard , two ways .
One , find them and bring them to justice -- what we 're doing -- and two , offer freedom as an alternative for their vision .
And somehow , to suggest that bees would stay in the hive is naive .
They did n't stay in the hive when they came and killed 3,000 of our citizens .
Alessandra Torresani and Eric Stoltz Cast in ' Battlestar ' Prequel ' Caprica '
Actress ( also credited as ) and veteran actorhave been added to the cast of the Battlestar Galactica prequel , Caprica .
Stoltz has been cast as computer engineer Daniel Graystone and Torresani will be playing his daughter , Zoe .
20 - year - old Torresani is from Palo Alto , CA , and has made appearances in films and on several TV shows , including Bones , Arrested Development , and Malcolm in the Middle , where she played Malcolm 's girlfriend .
The prequel is set on the fictional planet Caprica , approximately fifty to seventy years before the events depicted in the re-imagined series .

The transcription factor NF - κB has been well studied in its role as an inflammatory signaling factor , and more recently in the context of aging .
In the context of inflammatory lung disease , NF - κB is downregulated by SIRT1 , a pro-longevity protein .
Furthermore , a focused analyses of its role in inflammaging have revealed that NF - κB expression is regulated by FOXO transcription factors , which are also involved in longevity assurance .
Fine ; we know what sorts of factors can prevent NF - κB from wreaking its havoc in the first place — but what about havoc that has already been wrought ?
Knowing what might have inhibited NF - κB in the past is all well and good , but it ’s cold comfort for individuals whose bodies are already undergoing its inflammatory ravages .
Happy news , then , from Adler et al. , who report that genetic knockdown of NF - κB can actually reverse inflammatory damage in the skin of aged mice :
Reversal of aging by NFκB blockade Genetic studies in model organisms such as yeast , worms , flies , and mice leading to lifespan extension suggest that longevity is subject to regulation .
In addition , various system - wide interventions in old animals can reverse features of aging .
To better understand these processes , much effort has been put into the study of aging on a molecular level .
In particular , genome - wide microarray analysis of differently aged individual organisms or tissues has been used to track the global expression changes that occur during normal aging .
Although these studies consistently implicate specific pathways in aging processes , there is little conservation between the individual genes that change .
To circumvent this problem , we have recently developed a novel computational approach to discover transcription factors that may be responsible for driving global expression changes with age .
We identified the transcription factor NFκB as a candidate activator of aging - related transcriptional changes in multiple human and mouse tissues .
Genetic blockade of NFκB in the skin of chronologically aged mice reversed the global gene expression program and tissue characteristics to those of young mice , demonstrating for the first time that disruption of a single gene is sufficient to reverse features of aging , at least for the short - term .
Could NFκB inhibitors be used to turn back the clock in age - damaged skin , or in other organs ?
At the moment , the state of the art is decidedly not up to the task .
Our own lab uses a wide range of pharmaceutical NFκB inhibitors for a variety of purposes , and the consensus is that these compounds make cells very unhappy ( though we do n’t know whether that is because of a direct effect on NFκB signaling or some off - target effect on other pathways ) .
Beyond that , NFκB is actually useful in contexts where inflammation is useful , as when the immune system is fighting off infections ( and some tumors ) .
What would be nice is if we could specifically turn off the transcription of NFκB in cells or tissues of interest , perhaps using therapeutic small RNAs or some other approach — but this is pie - in - the - sky assumption of a can opener ; if we could turn off specific genes in specific cells we could basically do anything in biology .
Then again , even decades before the technology becomes available , it does n’t hurt to start compiling a prioritized list of the things we ’d do with it .
In early 2007 the Florida Bar filed a five count , 38 - page complaint against Florida Lawyer Jack Thompson , seeking sanctions against the outspoken critic of video games .
" This is frankly once again just the Bar going off the deep end trying to use Bar rules to limit my First Amendment activism , " Thompson said about the matter , according to Law.com .
The trial ended in December 2007 , and the verdict was expected in late April of this year .
Judge Dava Tunis had asked for an extension in order to , among other things , deal with 400 " pleadings , e-mails , letters and missives ( including pictorials ) " sent by Thompson since the end of the trial .
Judge Tunis has now released her report , with recommendations that Thompson be found guilty of 27 of the 31 charges .
These are not small offenses , as Judge Tunis recommended a guilty verdict for , among other things , " knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal , " " using means that have no purpose other than to embarrass , delay , or burden a third person , " " engaging in conduct involving dishonesty , fraud , deceit , or misrepresentation , " and " making statements that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity concerning to the qualifications or integrity of a judge . "
It 's hard to take Thompson 's communications with the courts , the press , or government officials seriously at this point .
Thompson has included gay pornography in his court filings , causing the Judge presiding over the case to note that " Mr. Thompson made available for unlimited public viewing , on the court ’s docketing system , these graphic images . "
In this most recent case , Thompson created a picture book in reaction to " the court 's inability to comprehend " what he was saying .
The book contained pictures of swastikas , a copied dollar bill , monkeys , and , in a surreal touch , a handprint with the word " slap " written under it .
That 's leaving out the cartoon squirrels .
Earlier this year , Thompson asked why another gaming writer does n't " just molest children directly rather than through Rockstar .
It would be more personal that way . "
Before the release of Grand Theft Auto IV , Jack Thompson wrote Ars Technica a letter that compared the game to polio .
These frenzied , nearly constant communications are at the heart of most of Thompson 's troubles .
Wisely , the Florida Supreme Court has declared that it will no longer accept any filings from the man unless they have been signed by another lawyer .
Thompson still has time before the Supreme Court makes a final ruling on these charges .
A hearing covering possible sanctions will be held on June 4 ; Judge Tunis ' final report is not due until early September .
The majority of the primary reporting on this case was done by GamePolitics.com , with the backing of the ECA .
" I want to mention that without ECA president Hal Halpin , this series would not have been possible , " writer Dennis McAuley wrote .
" When I pitched the idea to Hal and asked that the gamer advocacy organization ( which owns GamePolitics ) cover the not - insignificant cost of acquiring the initial round of transcripts , he did n't hesitate .
When we needed additional transcripts later , Hal insisted that the ECA cover the expense . "
McCauley invited Thompson to share his closing statement , and any other insights he had about the trial .
After ranting at the writer , Thompson finally stated that he " spent nine days in trial .
I do n't have to relive it for a twit who could n't care less what really happened there , asshole . "
Despite the ambivalence of the mainstream media in reporting on this case , and no matter what the final outcome turns out to be , the coverage of the trial has done something more damaging than any attack Thompson could have dreamed up on his own : it has let the public judge the man through his own actions and words .
GamePolitics was able to get Thompson 's closing statement , and the man spoke like a captain straightening his coat as the ship goes down .
" I 'm simply making the argument , Judge , that my motivations — which I have tried to make clear , maybe to the point of nausea — are religious and that my efforts against the distribution of adult material , pornographic material , violent material , adult rated material to children is violative of the law as well as violative of Scripture .
I quoted the biblical passage where Jesus says , reportedly : ' If any one of you should cause one of these little ones to stumble , it would be better that a millstone be tied around your neck and that you be cast in the uttermost depths of the sea . ' "
Parachinar , the largest town in the Kurram tribal agency , was a small market center twelve years ago .
Now it is a crowded city of 300,000 , characterized by brutal concrete , electricity outages , water shortages , battles over property rights , and terrorism powered by guns that are filtering back into Pakistan from Afghanistan .
When I asked the assistant political agent for Kurram , Massoud Urrahma , if military rule had made a difference , he replied dismissively , " Whether the government in Islamabad is military or democratic does n't matter .
We have no civil law here — only Pashtoon tribal law . "
The Pashtoon population of Kurram is split between Sunnis and Shias .
In September of 1996 a gun battle among teenage members of the two rival Muslim sects escalated into a communal war in which more than 200 people were killed and women and children were kidnapped .
A paramilitary official said that the atrocities were out of " the Stone Age " ; militants even executed out - of - towners who were staying at a local hotel .
Now the situation in Parachinar is peaceful but extremely tense .
Paramilitaries guard the streets around the Sunni and Shia mosques , which stand nearly side by side , their minarets scarred by bullet holes .
Only a few weeks before my visit seventeen people had been killed in violence between Sunnis and Shias in another tribal region of the North - West Frontier .
" The Shias are eighty percent of the Kurram agency , " the Shia leader in Parachinar , Mohammed Anwar , told me .
" The problems have all been caused by Afghan refugees who support the Sunnis . " Yet the Sunni leader , Haji Asghar Din , claims that 75 percent of the local population is Sunni .
He told me that Sunnis can not buy land from Shias — " so how can we consider them our brothers ? "
The only certainty is that Parachinar , hemmed in by the Safed Koh Mountains on the Afghan border , has little more room to expand .
A high birth rate and a flood of Afghan refugees have intensified the property conflicts .
Population growth has also weakened the power of tribal elders and created extremist youth factions .
The lack of water and electricity has increased anger .
Meanwhile , the government schools are abysmal — often without teachers , books , and roofs .
The poor , who form the overwhelming majority , cannot afford the private academies , so they send their children to Sunni and Shia madrassas , where students are well cared for and indoctrinated with sectarian beliefs .
Every person I interviewed was sullen and reticent .
One day a crowd of men surrounded me and led me to the back of a pharmacy , where they took turns denouncing America and telling me that the Taliban were good because they had restored security to Afghanistan , ending mujahideen lawlessness .
The " external hand of India " was to blame for the local troubles between Sunnis and Shias here , I was told .
Conspiracy theories , I have noticed , are inflamed by illiteracy : people who can't read rely on hearsay .
In Pakistan the adult literacy rate is below 33 percent .
In the tribal areas it is below that .
As for the percentage of women in Parachinar who can read , I heard figures as low as two percent ; nobody really knows .
Karachi
Tribal and religious unrest in Pakistan is aggravated by terrible living conditions and divisive nationalisms .
These are most clearly seen in Karachi , far to the south , on the Arabian Sea .
Traditionless , dysfunctional , and unstable , Karachi is an unfortunately apt metaphor for Pakistan 's general condition .
Only a quarter of the 14 million residents are native to Sind , the region around Karachi , and are themselves migrants from the drought - stricken interior .
The rest are immigrants from elsewhere on the Subcontinent .
At least a quarter of the populace lives in katchiabaadis , " temporary houses " built haphazardly of corrugated iron , cinder blocks , wattle , burlap , and cardboard , with stones and tires anchoring their rattling roofs .
Vistas of these houses go on for miles .
Some katchiabaadi neighborhoods have existed for decades ; they have shops , teahouses , and makeshift playgrounds .
Goats wander everywhere .
Children and adults sift through mounds of garbage in search of items to recycle .
" The water situation is getting worse ; electricity and other infrastructure are hopeless , " a foreign expert told me .
" The entire foundation of life here is imploding — except , of course , in the neighborhoods where people have lots of money . "

'... Just like natural organisms , the financial system must have death to evolve into a better form ...'
Now that he 's wearing some sort of do - good government hat , even Hank Paulson is not thinking straight .
Regulate in New York and finance goes to Toronto .
Regulate in London , it goes to Frankfurt or Paris and since Toronto , Frankfurt and Paris are run by the same nervous bureaucrat - types , we can reckon soon enough that the entire financial markets will be hosted out of Singapore and Shanghai .
There they will accept the risks as well as the rewards , to their very considerable long - term benefit .
You simply cannot enjoy being the financial center of the world but start bleating for government bailout whenever asset prices dip a few percent .
As Paulson is demonstrating , the regulatory price for being bailed out is far too high .
We must all grow up and take a full measure of punishment .
The banks must take theirs .
I hate duplicate code .
Hate it hate it hate it .
At the same time , I do like having my code check its arguments .
After a while , I noticed that half of the functions I wrote looked like this
void SomeMethod ( Foo foo ) { if ( foo == null ) throw new ArgumentNullException ( " foo " ) ; // ... }
That ’s good code in the sense that it bails on null , but it ’s got a couple of things I do n’t like .
First , I have to keep copying and pasting that exception line in every method .
I know , it ’s just one line , but it started to annoy me .
Worse is that to a caller of the function , there ’s no way to tell that SomeMethod ( ) does n’t allow a null value for foo without looking at the method body ( which may not be available to an API user ) .
The Nullable < T> type in the BCL ( which is automatically aliased to it ’s more familiar ? , as in “ int ? ” ) had me wondering .
Can I make the opposite ?
A “ not nullable ? ”
NotNull<T>
Let ’s build it a bit at a time .
The core not - very - clever idea is just a class that wraps a reference .
When you construct it , it throws our familiar ArgumentNullException if the reference is null :
public class NotNull < T > { public T Value { get { return mValue ; } } public NotNull ( T maybeNull ) { if ( maybeNull == null ) { throw new ArgumentNullException ( " maybeNull " ) ; } mValue = maybeNull ; } private T mValue ; }
Definitely not rocket science .
Now you can define methods like this :
void SomeMethod ( NotNull < Foo > foo ) {}
By the time you get to your method body , you can be sure that foo is not null .
Unfortunately , your call sites just got uglier :
SomeMethod ( new NotNull ( myFoo ) ) ;
A conversion operator will fix that :
// in NotNull < T> public static implicit operator NotNull < T >( T maybeNull ) { return new NotNull < T >( maybeNull ) ; }
Now the call sites are unchanged :
SomeMethod ( m Foo ) ;
and when you make the call , it will automatically call the conversion , which will in turn bail if myFoo is null .
We can make things a little easier by providing a conversion the other way too :
public static implicit operator T ( NotNull < T > notNull ) { return notNull .
Value ; }
Now you can do this :
void SomeMethod ( NotNull < Foo > foo ) { // will automatically convert on assign :)
Foo someFoo = foo ; // but not on member access :( // ca n't do foo .
SomeFooProperty , have to do : foo .
Value .
SomeFooProperty ; }
Not too shabby .
The bonus , and the real reason I like this is that you ’ve now decorated the function signature itself with its requirements .
Any caller of SomeMethod ( ) will now see in Intellisense that it requires a NotNull < Foo > .
We ’ve moved an imperative exception check to a declarative property of the argument itself .
Caveats
I ’d like to say this is a perfect solution , but alas it ’s not .
There ’s at least one caveat to be aware of .
This wo n’t work with interface types .
That ’s because value types can implement interfaces too , and you ca n’t compare a value type to null .
If you can figure out a way around this , holler .
Edit : as Brad points out below , this does work with interfaces … sort of .
The limitation is that implicit conversion operators do n’t work with them .
The actual wrapping and null checks are fine .
It ’s just that to use it with an interface , you have to do :
SomeMethod ( new NotNull ( myInterfaceFoo ) ) ;
which is kind of lame .
But aside from that , you can use interfaces with this .
Thanks , B - Rad !
The Whole Shebang
Oh , and here ’s a prettier version with comments and stuff .
Do n’t say I never gave you nothing :
/// < summary > /// < para > ///

Provides implicit cast operators to automatically wrap and unwrap /// values .
/// </ para> /// < para > /// NotNull{T} can be used as an argument to a method to ensure that /// no < c > null < / c> values are passed to the method in place of manually /// throwing an < see cref= " ArgumentNullException " />.

and a unit test :
The agency ’s secretary general , Ronald Noble , said : “ The law enforcement community around the world has done all it can to find this man who clearly presents a danger to young children and we are now asking the public to help identify this predator and protect other potential victims from abuse . ”
Iran says it is enriching uranium for a civilian power programme Iran has begun installing 6,000 new centrifuges at its main nuclear plant in Natanz , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said .
He also appeared to cast doubt on the official version of the 9/11 attacks and accused the US of using them as a " pretext " to launch invasions .
Iran is already thought to have some 3,000 centrifuges - which are used to enrich uranium - at its Natanz plant .
The US and Western allies condemned him but disagreed on how to respond .
Later , Mr Ahmadinejad claimed Iran had tested on Tuesday advanced new equipment - thought to be a reference to a possible new generation of centrifuges .
' Five times greater '
" The capacity of these new machines ... is five times greater than the current machines , " he told a televised event in Tehran .
He made the comments following a visit to Natanz to mark national nuclear day .
Iran has been enriching uranium at its underground facility in Natanz Turning his attention to the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US , Mr Ahmadinejad said : " On the pretext of this incident a major military operation was launched and oppressed Afghanistan was attacked .
" Tens of thousands of people have been killed until now .
Poor Iraq was attacked . "
He also alleged the names of the people killed in the attacks on New York 's World Trade Center had never been published .
And he added : " How is it possible that with the best radar systems and intelligence networks the planes could crash undetected into the towers ? "
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appealed to Tehran to halt enrichment .
" Iran faces continued isolation in the international community because it will not take a reasonable offer from the international community to have another way , " she said .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner suggested sanctions on Iran could be " reinforced " .
Last month , the UN Security Council approved a third round of sanctions against Iran .
But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov instead suggested a new package of incentives to encourage Iran to halt uranium enrichment .

Clinton asks supporters for campaign cash after PA win Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday April 22 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton scored an expected win over Barack Obama in Pennsylvania 's Democratic primary Tuesday night and she took the opportunity to ask supporters for desperately needed campaign donations .
" It 's a long road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and it runs right through the heart of Pennsylvania , " Clinton said to kick off her victory speech , reiterating a cliché her campaign repeated at nearly every opportunity leading up to Tuesday 's vote .
The former first lady , who raised half as much money as Barack Obama last month , used her nationally televised speech to direct supporters to her campaign Web site to make a donation .
She tacitly acknowledged the uphill battle that remains if she is to snatch the nomination from Obama , who has massively out - raised Clinton in the money race and holds virtually insurmountable leads in pledged delegates and the popular vote .
" Your support has meant the difference between winning and losing , " she told a raucous crowd in Philadelphia .
" We can only keep winning if we can keep competing ... so I hope you 'll go to Hillary Clinton.com and show your support tonight because the future of this campaign is in your hands . "
Clinton 's campaign
Web site automatically redirected to a donation page Tuesday night encouraging supporters to contribute at least $ 5 to Clinton 's campaign .
The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder reported that the Clinton campaign claimed it raised $ 500,000 before the Pennsylvania polls closed Tuesday .
Clinton needed the influx of cash , as she was outspent in Pennsylvania and out - raised last month by a two - to - one margin by Obama ( he raised more than $ 40 million to her $ 20 million ) .
Clinton 's campaign is also severely in debt , owing more to campaign consultants , vendors and others than it currently has in the bank .
As the votes were counted Tuesday , Clinton 's lead ranged between six and 10 points ; it remained to be seen how the win would be perceived .
Such a margin , however , would make it essentially impossible for her to overtake Obama in the pledged delegate count before the Democratic primaries end in June , MSNBC 's Chuck Todd noted .
In her victory speech , Clinton spoke of her roots in the Keystone state , repeated her insistence that she can lead " from day one " and offered herself as someone who is a problem solver .
In his post - Pennsylvania speech , Obama focused on his main message in this campaign : that he can change the way the political game is played in a way Clinton cannot .
He also implicitly accused Clinton of simply pandering to the state 's voters .
" In every election , politicians come to your cities and your towns , and they tell you what you want to hear , and they make big promises , and they lay out all these plans and policies .
But then they go back to Washington when the campaigns over .
Lobbyists spend millions of dollars to get their way .
The status quo sets in .
And instead of fighting for health care or jobs , Washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week .
It happens year after year after year , " Obama said , according to the prepared text of his speech .
Obama went on critique Clinton 's foreign policy positions .
" We can be a party that thinks the only way to look tough on national security is to talk , and act , and vote like George Bush and John McCain .
We can use fear as a tactic , and the threat of terrorism to scare up votes , " Obama said , apparently referencing Clinton 's vote in favor of sending the military to Iraq and her use of Osama bin Laden in a recent ad .
" Or we can decide that real strength is asking the tough questions before we send our troops to fight , " he continued .
" We can see the threats we face for what they are  a call to rally all Americans and all the world against the common challenges of the 21st century  terrorism and nuclear weapons ; climate change and poverty ; genocide and disease .
That s what it takes to keep us safe in the world .
That s the real legacy of Roosevelt and Kennedy and Truman . "
Despite its sciencey - sounding name , there is no such thing as " detoxification " beyond what your body already does .

Today we 're going to head into the bathroom and suck the toxins out of our bodies through our feet and through our bowels , and achieve a wonderful sense of wellness that medical science just has n't caught onto yet .
Today 's topic is the myth of detoxification , as offered for sale by alternative practitioners and herbalists everywhere .
To better understand this phenomenon , it 's necessary to define what they mean by toxins .
Are they bacteria ?
Chemical pollutants ?
Trans fats ?
Heavy metals ?
To avoid being tested , they leave this pretty vague .
Actual medical treatments will tell you exactly what they do and how they do it .
Alternative detoxification therapies do n't do either one .
They pretty much leave it up to the imagination of the patient to invent their own toxins .
Most people who seek alternative therapy believe themselves to be afflicted by some kind of self - diagnosed poison ; be it industrial chemicals , McDonald 's cheeseburgers , or fluoridated water .
If the marketers leave their claims vague , a broader spectrum of patients will believe that the product will help them .
And , of course , the word " toxin " is sufficiently scientific - sounding that it 's convincing enough by itself to many people .
Let 's assume that you work in a mine or a chemical plant and had some vocational accident , and fear that you might have heavy metal poisoning .
What should you do ?
Any responsible person will go to a medical doctor for a blood test to find out for certain whether they have such poisoning .
A person who avoids this step , because they prefer not to hear that the doctor can't find anything , is not a sick person .
He is a person who wants to be sick .
Moreover , he wants to be sick in such a way that he can take control and self - medicate .
He wants an imaginary illness , caused by imaginary toxins .
Now it 's fair for you to stop me at this point and call me out on my claim that these toxic conditions are imaginary .
I will now tell you why I say that , and then as always , you should judge for yourself .
Let 's start with one of the more graphic detoxification methods , gruesomely pictured on websites and in chain emails .
It 's a bowel cleansing pill , said to be herbal , which causes your intestines to produce long , rubbery , hideous looking snakes of bowel movements , which they call mucoid plaque .
There are lots of pictures of these on the Internet , and sites that sell these pills are a great place to find them .
Look at DrNatura.com , BlessedHerbs.com , and AriseAndShine.com , just for a start .
Imagine how terrifying it would be to actually see one of those come out of your body .
If you did , it would sure seem to confirm everything these websites have warned about toxins building up in your intestines .
But there 's more to it .
As it turns out , any professional con artist would be thoroughly impressed to learn the secrets of mucoid plaque ( and , incidentally , the term mucoid plaque was invented by these sellers ; there is no such actual medical condition ) .
These pills consist mainly of bentonite , an absorbent , expanding clay similar to kitty litter .
Combined with psyllium , used in the production of mucilage polymer , bentonite forms a rubbery cast of your intestines when taken internally , mixed of course with whatever else your body is excreting .
Surprise , a giant rubbery snake of toxins in your toilet .
It 's important to note that the only recorded instances of these " mucoid plaque " snakes in all of medical history come from the toilets of the victims of these cleansing pills .
No gastroenterologist has ever encountered one in tens of millions of endoscopies , and no pathologist has ever found one during an autopsy .
They do not exist until you take such a pill to form them .
The pill creates the very condition that it claims to cure .
And the results are so graphic and impressive that no victim would ever think to argue with the claim .
Victims , did I call them ?
Creating rubber casts of your bowels might be gross but I have n't seen that it 's particularly dangerous , so why are they victims ?
A one month supply of these pills costs $ 88 from the websites I mentioned .
$ 88 for a few pennies worth of kitty litter in a pretty bottle promising herbal and organic cleansing .
Yeah , they 're victims .
It 's already been widely reported that alternative practitioners who provide colon cleansing with tubes and liquids have killed a number of their customers by causing infections and perforated bowels , and for this reason the FDA has made it illegal to sell such equipment , except for use in medical colon cleansing to prepare for radiologic endoscopic examinations .
There is no legally sold colon cleansing equipment approved for general well being or detoxification .
As usual , the alternative practitioners stay one step ahead of the law .
There are a number of electrical foot bath products on the market .
The idea is that you stick your feet in the bath of salt water , usually with some herbal or homeopathic additive , plug it in and switch it on , and soak your feet .
After a while the water turns a sickly brown , and this is claimed to be the toxins that have been drawn out of your body through your feet .
One tester found that his water turned brown even when he did not put his feet in .
The reason is that electrodes in the water corrode via eletrolysis , putting enough oxidized iron into the water to turn it brown .
When reporter Ben Goldacre published these results in the Guardian Unlimited online news , some of the marketers of these products actually changed their messaging to admit this was happening — but again , staying one step ahead — now claim that their product is not about detoxification , it 's about balancing the body 's energy fields :
Another meaningless , untestable claim .
But detoxifying through the feet did n't end there .
A newcomer to the detoxification market is Kinoki foot pads , available at BuyKinoki.com .
These are adhesive gauze patches that you stick to the sole of your foot at night , and they claim to " draw " " toxins " from your body .
They also claim that all Japanese people have perfect health , and the reason is that they use Kinoki foot pads to detoxify their bodies , a secret they 've been jealously guarding from medical science for hundreds of years .
A foolish claim like this is demonstrably false on every level , and should raise a huge red flag to any critical reader .
Nowhere in any of their marketing materials do they say what these alleged toxins are , or what mechanism might cause them to move from your body into the adhesive pad .
Kinoki foot pads contain unpublished amounts of vinegar , tourmaline , chitin , and other unspecified ingredients .
Tourmaline is a semi- precious gemstone that 's inert and not biologically reactive , so it has no plausible function .
Chitin is a type of polymer used in gauze bandages and medical sutures , so naturally it 's part of any gauze product .
They probably mention it because some alternative practitioners believe that chitin is a " fat attractor " , a pseudoscientific claim which has never been supported by any evidence or plausible hypothesis .
I guess they hope that we will infer by extension that chitin also attracts " toxins " out of the body .
Basically the Kinoki foot pads are gauze bandages with vinegar .
Vinegar has many folk - wisdom uses when applied topically , such as treating acne , sunburn , warts , dandruff , and as a folk antibiotic .
But one should use caution : Vinegar can cause chemical burns on infants , and the American Dietetic Association has tracked cases of home vinegar applications to the foot causing deep skin ulcers after only two hours .
Since the Kinoki foot pads are self - adhesive , peeling them away removes the outermost layer of dead skin cells .
And since they are moist , they loosen additional dead cells when left on for a while .
So it 's a given that the pads will look brown when peeled from your foot , exactly like any adhesive tape would ; though this effect is much less dramatic than depicted on the TV commercials , depending on how dirty your feet are .
And , as they predict , this color will diminish over subsequent applications , as fewer and fewer of your dead , dirty skin cells remain .
There is no magic detoxification needed to explain this effect .
( Later news :
In fact , Kinoki footpads contain powdered wood vinegar , which always turns brownish black when exposed to moisture , such as sweat . – BD )
Anyone interested in detoxifying their body might think about paying a little more attention to their body and less attention to the people trying to get their money .
The body already has nature 's most effective detoxification system .
It 's called the liver .
The liver changes the chemical structure of foreign compounds so they can be filtered out of the blood by the kidneys , which then excrete them in the urine .
I am left wondering why the alternative practitioners never mention this option to their customers .
It 's all - natural and proven effective .
Is it ironic that the only people who will help you manage this all - natural option are the medical doctors ?
Certainly your naturopath wo n't .
He wants to sell you some klunky half - legal hardware .
Why is it that so many people are more comfortable self - medicating for conditions that exist only in advertisements , than they are simply taking their doctor 's advice ?
It 's because doctors are burdened with the need to actually practice medicine .
They wo n't hide bad news from you or make up easy answers to please you .
But that 's what people want :
The easy answers promised by advertisements and alternative practitioners .
They want the fantasy of being in complete personal control of what goes on inside their bodies .
A doctor wo n't lie to you and say that a handful of herbal detoxification pills will cure anything that 's wrong with you ; but since that 's the solution many people want , there 's always someone willing to sell it .

The IMF hopes to cash in from the soaring price of gold The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has proposed selling some of its gold holdings as part of radical plans to shore up its troubled finances .
It hopes to raise at least $ 6bn ( £ 3 bn ) from the sale of 12.97 million ounces of gold , about 12 % of the total held .
As the IMF 's role as a lender to troubled economies shrinks , so it needs to find other ways to access funds .
Gold has surged recently as traders looked for havens to protect their cash from troubled financial markets .
The gold sale is dependent on approval by US Congress .
It also relies on approval from many of the 185 countries that are members of the Washington - based institution .
It is a fundamental step that will enable the institution to remain an independent , astute , and dynamic international organisation
IMF boss Dominique Strauss - Khan ' Difficult choice ' IMF boss Dominique Strauss - Kahn called the decision a " difficult but necessary choice " that will help to modernise the group and put it on a " solid financial footing " .
IMF officials said the sale would likely take place over several years in an effort to avoid market disruption .
Gold prices reached an all - time record above $ 1,000 an ounce in March , but have been volatile since then .
Gold futures for June delivery added $ 13.60 to $ 926.80 an ounce in New York trade .
The IMF holds 103.4 m ounces of gold .
As of 20 February , they were worth $ 95.2 bn .
New income framework
The funds from the IMF 's gold sale would be used to buy US government and corporate bonds to generate income and plug a $ 400 m shortfall in funds that is projected over the next two to three years .
It is part of a dramatic overhaul of its income model , which has over the past 60 years been reliant on lending to poor countries to support its role as the supervisor of the world economy .
But the need for its emergency loans has tailed off in the past decade as many developing economies , particularly in Asia , have built up large reserves of foreign currency to reduce the risk of a future crisis .
This also prompted the IMF to make $ 100 m of spending cuts from its budget over the next three years to 2011 .
The move " will enable the institution to remain an independent , astute , and dynamic international organisation that facilitates global cooperation and action to ensure financial stability and prosperity for all , " Mr Strauss - Kahn said .
It follows a decision last month to move voting power away from traditional industrial powers including the US , the UK and Germany to powerful emerging countries , including China , India and Brazil , which are playing a growing role in the world economy .

What are these ?
Rep. Ron Paul had the job 20 years ago .
Now , it 's former Rep. Bob Barr 's turn .
He 's been chosen the 2008 presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party after numerous rounds of balloting that not many people care about .
The Libertarians , convening in Denver , named him Sunday .
" I 'm sure we will emerge here with the strongest ticket in the history of the Libertarian Party , " Barr said in his victory speech .
Which may not be saying much , because as determined as many of its followers are , there simply are n't enough of them to elect their ticket to anything .
The Libertarians have been good for only around 3 % of the vote in recent elections .
However , 3 % in a close election between the Republican and Democratic tickets could make the difference .
Much as Ralph Nader drew enough votes from Al Gore in 2000 to help George W. Bush win the White House , the little - known Barr could draw enough votes of dissatisfied conservatives to hurt Sen.
John McCain 's chances as the GOP nominee .
" I want everybody to remember , " Barr told conventioneers , " that we only have 163 days to win this election .
We cannot waste one single day . "

Summary
In this presentation , Lex Spoon discusses the Scala programming language .
Topics covered include the origin of Scala , the philosophy behind Scala , the Scala feature set , Object - Oriented and Functional programming in Scala , examples of Scala code , writing DSLs , how Scala is converted into Java , Scala performance , Abstract Data Types , unapply , actors and partial functions .
Bio Lex Spoon divides his time between two posts : he works at EPFL in Switzerland on the Scala team , and at IBM Research in New York on X10 .
He thus has a lot of recent experience with advanced programming languages that play nice with the existing Java world .
About the conference JAOO is the premier European developer conference on software technology , methods and best practices .
The conference presents in - depth presentations and tutorials by researchers , engineers and trend - setters in software engineering and technology .
The feature set for Firefox 3 has long been frozen , and committed – it ’s well on its way to becoming a polished browser , at this point .
It ’s time to start looking ahead , specifically , at the feature set of JavaScript in the next version of the browser .
Traditionally JavaScript 1.X releases ( 1.6 , 1.7 , 1.8 , and now 1.9 ) have served to introduce new features into the language that help to pave the way towards its next major release .
The size and scope of the features have , generally , varied – the importance of generators and iterators – or let statements – are , arguably , much more than , say , expression closures .
However , since the final feature set for ECMAScript 4 ( JavaScript 2 ) has calmed down , with implementors starting to lay their code on the line , it ’s becoming easier to get a full picture of what will be happening in the near future of the language .
A few of us Mozilla folk will be meeting tomorrow at the ECMAScript 4 implementors meeting in Newton , MA to discuss what features , and bug fixes , should be pursued .
I have a few that , I feel , are no -brainers like a builtin Function .
prototype.bind and a native JSON encoder / decoder .
It ’s doubtful that we ’ll be able to land too much with this release ( we ’re hoping to get it out as quickly as possible , post Firefox 3 – so do n’t expect too much ) but , as always , input is appreciated .
At the very least , I ’ll be able to let you know where your suggestions lie within the scope of the language .
I should have an update after the meeting with a full re-cap of what was concluded .
A US Army soldier who served as a military journalist in Afghanistan , Japan , Europe and the Philippines announced Thursday his intent to refuse orders to deploy to Iraq .
" As an Army journalist whose job it was to collect and filter service members ’ stories , I heard many stomach - churning testimonies of the horrors of the crimes taking place in Iraq , " said Sergeant Matthis Chiroux , 24 , in an announcement under the rotunda of the House of Representative ’s Cannon Office Building .
" For fear of retaliation from the military , I failed to report these crimes , but never again will I allow fear to silence me .
Never again will I fail to stand , " he said .
Chiroux said he ’s aware he will likely face prosecution for refusing the deployment , but said , " I choose to remain in the United States to defend myself from charges brought by the Army if they are willing to pursue them .
I refuse to participate in the occupation of Iraq . "
Chiroux is a victim of stop - loss , a controversial wartime power that the George W. Bush administration has used to keep soldiers from leaving the military when their term of service expires .
Critics call the policy a " back - door draft " .
More than 50,000 troops have been stop - lossed since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
In an interview shortly before his announcement , Chiroux told IPS the stop - loss order sent him into a downward spiral of depression .
" I became borderline suicidal , " he said .
" I just went into my room and shut the door and barely emerged for close to a month .
I just sat in my room reading news about Iraq and feeling completely hopeless , like I would be forced to go and no one would ever know how I felt .
I was getting looped into participating in a crime against humanity and all with the realization that I never wanted to be there in the first place . "
The turning point , Chiroux said , came when one of his professors at Brooklyn College in New York suggested he listen to the Winter Soldier hearings .
The hearings , which were organized by Iraq Veterans Against the War , took place in March in Washington , DC .
Iraq Veterans Against the War argues that well - publicized incidents of US brutality like the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the massacre of an entire family of Iraqis in the town of Haditha are not isolated incidents perpetrated by " a few bad apples " , but part of a pattern , the group says , of " an increasingly bloody occupation " .
For four days , dozens of Iraq war veterans testified about the horrors they ’d seen and the actions they carried out while deployed .
As Chiroux listened to their testimony , he realized he was not alone .
" Here ’s an organization of soldiers and veterans who feel like me , " he said .
" All this alienation and depression that I feel started to ease .
I found them and I ’ve been speaking out with them ever since . "
Chiroux timed his announcement to coincide with a Congressional forum meant to highlight testimony offered at Winter Soldier within the halls of Congress .
Nine veterans spoke at the hearing , which was organized by the Congressional Progressive Caucus .
They talked about extremely lax rules of engagement handed down by commanding officers , which they said virtually guaranteed atrocities would be committed — which in turn would create a violent backlash among Iraqi people and a continued cycle of violence .
" On several occasions our convoys came upon bodies that been lying on the road , sometimes for weeks , " said Marine Corps veteran Vincent Emmanuele , who served in al - Qaim near the Syrian border in 2004 and 2005 .
" When encountering these bodies standard procedure was to run over the corpses , sometimes even stopping and taking pictures , which was also standard practice when encountering the dead in Iraq , " he told the Progressive Caucus .
" On one specific occasion , after I had shot a man trying to flee while planting a roadside bomb , we dragged his body out of the ditch he was laying in and we subsequently left this man to rot in a field where we saw this man up to a week later , " Emmanuele said .
Members of Iraq Veterans Against the War hope Thursday ’s Progressive Caucus hearing will spark an investigation by a full Congressional committee and speed the end of the wars .
But with the House of Representatives moving toward approving another 186 billion dollars in war funding , these former soldiers and Marines will have to satisfy themselves with the sentiments of liberal Congresspeople like Maxine Waters , who praised the veterans for speaking out .
" I want to thank you for having more courage than many members of Congress have for coming here in defiance of what you have been instructed and taught to do , " she said .
" They attempted to tell you that you should be satisfied by everything that you saw and everything that you did and everything you witnessed , but you ’re not .
I praise and honor you for that . "

David Halpin looks at the litany of crimes for which former British Prime Minister Tony Blair will have to account sooner or later .
On the same day the BBC reported that former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was to go on trial after five years in prison over the deaths of a group of Baghdad merchants in 1992 , it was rumoured the former prime minister of Britain will be indicted for crimes against humanity .
The list of charges is long and not confined to the many alleged crimes in Iraq .
Mr Blair 's whereabouts are uncertain ; he has been sighted occasionally in occupied East Jerusalem where he is acting as " peace " envoy for the " Quartet " .
Most recently , he has been facilitating industrial zones for the employment of Palestinians and for the removal of a few of the over 500 Israeli Occupation Force roadblocks .
The charge list includes :
Examination of this picture shows Ali Abbas was subjected to radiated heat Breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention from the time he became prime minister in 1997 until March 2003 during whichtime draconian sanctions were being applied to the civilian population of Iraq .
These sanctions prompted the resignation of Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck who served as assistant secretaries - general of the UN .
The former stated that the effect of those sanctions was genocidal .
It was established that there was an excess mortality of babies and children of at least 500,000 between 1992 and 2003 .
This had to do with foul water , poor nutrition and deteriorating medical services , all of which were satisfactory before the sanctions took hold .
Conspiracy to join with another power in aggressive war , the supreme international war crime , contrary to the Nuremberg Rules and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nation .
This was first made public when he joined Mr George Bush , President of the United States of America , and Britain for bloodied steaks over a barbecue at Crawford Ranch in April 2002 .
High treason ( betrayal of one 's country , sovereign or government ) in manufacturing a case for war , the central one of which was the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq .
This in itself gave no grounds because the possession of such was no basis for a military assault on a sovereign country .
Three aggressive nations , the US , UK and Israel , have held weapons of mass destruction for decades ; no attempt has been made to disarm them .
The grounds for UK military action against Iraq changed as the unlawful operation proceeded under the guise of liberation of the people and Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
The part played by the " sofa cabinet " , three of whom were unelected , in promulgating a war fought on behalf of Her Majesty is being minutely examined by law officers .
One such cabinet member , Mr Charles Powell , recently stated on BBC TV that the aim of the war was the removal of Saddam Hussein from power .
He would know that was an illegal aim .
Ann Clywd MP was appointed Mr Blair 's human rights envoy in Iraq .
She has continuously claimed a virtuous aim ... [ but the fact is that ] at least a million Iraqis have been killed , about 40 per cent of whom will have been children .
Using a conservative ratio , at least two million will have been maimed .
Ali Abbas 's trunk , hands and forearms were incinerated Mr Blair is charged with a litany of war crimes that followed the invasion , one of which is the failure of the " coalition of the willing " to halt the further deterioration in the quality and quantity of medical services in Iraq which had already worsened during the 12 years of sanctions .
Another obligation of an occupier is to maintain security for the populace .
The very opposite happened .
Disbanding the Iraqi army and other Baathist structures was central to the violent chaos which followed the invasion .
Protecting the heritage of a country is another obligation of an occupier in international law .
Mr Blair failed as leader to meet these and he is so charged .
The general charges in this indictment are followed by an annex which details names in which there has been death or extreme injury .
The charges also include collusion in a military and political coalition which has used banned weapons .
The use of white phosphorus at Fallujah by the US was admitted .
Armour - penetrating tank and cannon shells , as well as " bunker busting " bombs and missiles , have used depleted uranium .
Uranium U238 is dispersed widely as a very fine dust ; it has been detected as far away as the UK .
Iraqi doctors claim that there have been dramatic rises in grotesque deformities in babies born prematurely , in leukaemia and in other malignancies .
The list of charges includes the case of Ali Abbas , then 12 years of age and formerly of the village of Zafaraniya , which is 30 miles from Baghdad , and his deceased family : his mother who was six months pregnant , his father , brother and at least 10 other relatives .
It has been reported that , just after midnight on 30 March 2003 and 10 days into " Operation Iraqi Freedom " , a weapon or two weapons exploded .
We had all gone to bed and there was this loud noise and smoke .
I felt very scared and I was in much pain .
I kept shouting for my mother .
I did not know at the time what had happened to her .
A photograph taken in hospital in Baghdad shows that Ali was burned across his trunk and that his hands and forearms were incinerated .
His head , neck , abdomen and legs were unblemished .
Examination of this photograph shows this boy was subjected to the most intense radiated heat � not contact heat .
Ali Abbas survived but his entire family were burnt by the Americans
It seems likely that his head and lower half were screened from the source of this radiation by a window aperture or similar , given the rectangular pattern of the thermal injuries .
The weapon that caused such rapid incineration is unknown .
It certainly was not a thermobaric weapon as used currently in Iraq and Gaza .
Uranium weapons give rise to a fireball as the dust ignites .
This can melt steel but there are no photographs of human victims of such attacks which match the incineration of the arms of Ali Abbas , although these weapons have been used frequently � both in the Gulf War and in the ongoing Iraq War .
The clandestine use of a small tactical nuclear weapon cannot not be ruled out .
The authorities will require that Ali Abbas comes to the Hague to give evidence .
However , he has not been able to leave Baghdad since last summer .
He has of course required someone else to attend to his every toilet need and to his dressing .
An uncle provided that for him whilst he grew from boy to man at the private boys school in London and where he excelled scholastically .
Another uncle took over last summer but a visa has not been forthcoming from the UK .
The US named Tariq Aziz the Eight of Spades , thus coming 43rd in the United States ' set of 55 playing cards .
His trial for involvement in the hanging of 40 alleged racketeers started on 29 April under a Kurdish judge and a military occupation .
The central charge against Anthony Charles Lynton Blair is that he has caused the death of thousands upon thousands of Iraqi civilians , the maiming of many more and the displacement of over four million people .
Unlike the treatment of those humans , his hearing will be fair .
It is understood that he will be able to receive a Catholic priest in the cell which was formerly occupied by Slobodan Milosevic .
The prison chaplain will encourage further study of " faith " , which with globalization were the topics of Mr Blair 's address in Westminster Cathedral .
The commander - in - chief of the USA spoke of the " sanctity of life " when he was receiving the Pontiff in Washington recently .
This principle will be applied to Anthony Charles Lynton Blair but probably not to the deputy prime minister of Iraq .

Studied outrage over the tribulations of Mark Steyn and Maclean ’s before various human rights commissions continued this last week , with editorials appearing in both the National Post and Maclean’s .
Granted , the complaints were an abuse of process , and means need to be found to prevent the frivolous and vexatious from reaching the tribunals .
Freedom of speech ought to be absolute , no matter how odious the subject .
But at the same time , I find myself unmoved by the suppression of free speech the complaints supposedly produced .
In point of fact no one ’s speech was actually curtailed .
As much as some might have wished , the authorities have not sequestered and burnt the original Maclean ’s article in any figurative or literal public square .
Mark Steyn continues to issue his screeds from his New Hampshire redoubt , unmolested .
No agents in the name of state security have hauled him to a nameless gulag .
A cursory glance at the magazine rack indicates Maclean ’s still publishes openly , its reduction to the status of samizdat postponed to the indefinite future .
At the end of the fuss , it ’s rather unclear as to whether Maclean ’s et al. are outraged over attempts to limit their speech by a few law students , or whether someone had the audacity to challenge the received wisdom on Islam and the West .
To be sure , the importance of freedom of speech cannot be underestimated , and the complaints , where they have been adjudicated , have been rightly tossed out .
My sourness at this triumph of freedom of expression resides in the generally parlous state of civil liberties in general : the subtle contempt for notions of human rights and due process by the present government , the replacement of open and fair trials by arbitrary justice , accusation treated as evidence for determining guilt or innocence , the implicit endorsement of torture as state policy , even if we do not condone it on our own soil , the endless intrusions on individual privacy by a government already bloated with information , “ no - fly ” lists , and the gaping void of secrecy which obscures all of these activities — all in the name of national security against a nebulous enemy whose strength the public cannot begin to gauge , because that too is secret .
While Maclean’s ,
The National Post and other organs of the free press fret away countless pails of ink on the real and imagined dangers to free speech , the erosion continues , unchecked and unremarked upon by the right - wing press ( and the media in general ) , in this country and abroad .
Examples of undereporting are numerous .
If you believe this is because civil liberties in Canada are intact , think again .
For example , in April 2007 The International Commission of Jurists held public hearings in Toronto and Ottawa to investigate the impact of counter terrorism legislation on civil liberties .
I quote part of its report at length :
The definition of terrorism and related offences under the Anti-Terrorism Act ( ATA ) Concerns were expressed about the speed with which ATA was enacted and in particular about the broad definition of “ terrorist activity ” contained in the Act and the risk that the clause requiring that the act be committed “ in whole or in part for a political , religious or ideological purpose , objective or cause ” leads to discrimination against the Muslim and Arab communities .
Many witnesses , including representatives of Arab and Muslim communities drew attention to a widespread belief within these communities that the implementation of the Act is directed against Muslims and Arabs resulting in their stigmatization and a sense of insecurity .
In this context , some participants welcomed the October 2006 ruling of the Superior Court of Ontario in the Khawaja case striking down the motivation requirement provision for being a violation of the rights to freedom of religion , expression and association while others expressed concern that the decision in fact broadens the definition .
The Government representatives informed the Panel that they were aware of the concerns of the Muslim community and that positive action is taken to create a climate in which these concerns can be addressed and resolved .
Concerns were raised about the breadth and imprecision of terminology used in the ATA , in particular the offence of “ facilitating terrorist activities ” and its potential implications for charities and persons .
Privacy Concerns were raised about warrantless electronic surveillance of international communications introduced under ATA and the lack of adequate safeguards over collection , storage and sharing of the data .
Participants expressed the view that an erosion of privacy within a free and democratic society could , in the long run , make the Canadian population less secure .
Secrecy Growing secrecy surrounding national security measures was raised as a major issue of concern , in particular , the increasing reliance on untested intelligence information that becomes a substitute for evidence .
In addition , concerns were expressed about cross - border sharing of intelligence information and about action taken on the basis of that intelligence that may have been obtained through torture and has often proven to be inaccurate .
These actions are a matter of great concern when liberty is at stake as documented by the Maher Arar Commission of Inquiry .
In light of these concerns , the introduction of a provision in Canada ’s domestic legislation to clearly prohibit the use in all legal and administrative proceedings of evidence obtained by torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment was proposed by some participants .
Concerns were raised also about the use of security certificates under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act ( IRPA ) as a form of administrative detention against non-citizens suspected of being a security threat and that , in practice , has led to the detention for years without charge or trial of those subject to the certificates with very limited judicial review .
Concerns were expressed about the secrecy of the proceedings ( ex parte and in camera ) in security certificate cases where evidence is presented only to the judge in the absence of the suspect and his or her counsel who only receive an unclassified summary of those proceedings .
Although almost all individuals subject to security certificates have been released as a result of the Charkaoui decision , strict conditions and limitations have been imposed on them affecting their freedom of movement and their right to privacy .
These measures constitute a severe form of punishment for persons who have not been accused or convicted of any crime .
Several participants have expressed scepticism about the possible resort to special advocates as used in the United Kingdom as this system also falls short of guaranteeing due process rights .
Deportation on the basis of diplomatic assurances against torture Serious concerns were raised about increasing reliance upon diplomatic assurances against torture to deport non-citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activities .
It was stressed that such deportation constitutes a major departure from the absolute prohibition in international law to send persons to countries where they face a risk of torture or ill - treatment .
This collection of particulars , from government invasion of privacy , to effectively imposing punishment on suspected terrorists without trial , to the use of immigration law as a tool to detain suspected security risks — an abuse of process if there ever was one — garnered exactly two references in the Canadian media , a Canadian Press story subsequently picked up by a Montreal radio station .
In contrast , a quick Google News search on the Steyn complaint yields 398 returns .
Bloggers in this case did a bit better : three posts referred to it .
The outrage was palpable , except it was n’t .
Or we can talk about the larger international scandal of detainees in United States custody .
Sami al - Hajj , an Al Jazeera journalist was released from prison four days ago .
If you have n’t heard of him , do n’t be surprised : the likes of Maclean ’s and Mark Steyn –or CBC , CTV , or CanWest Global– are n’t particularly interested in his plight .
He was one of the 275 faceless prisoners still remaining in American custody at Guantanamo Bay .
He was arrested in Pakistan after the Afghan invasion , despite being accredited with Al Jazeera , apparently for the crime of being Muslim , Sudanese , and a journalist all at once .
He had obtained an interview with Osama bin Laden and between 1996 and 2000 he transferred money at the behest of his then employer to Islamic charities linked to terrorist activity .
He spent 78 months at Guantanamo as an “ enemy combatant . ”
No charges were ever laid .
He was never tried .
His lawyer was prevented by law from seeing the evidence against him .
He went on a hunger strike , and for the last sixteen months he was force - fed by means of a naso - gastric tube twice daily , a procedure when administered against an unwilling person , is the very definition of torture .
When finally released , one imagines a few hushed words of regret , a token offer of compensation , a handshake and the equivalent of a second - hand suit and a bus ticket .
There was none of that .
Instead , he was blindfolded , handcuffed and chained to his seat on his flight home .
“ In Guantanamo , ” he says , “ rats are treated with more humanity . ”
One can believe it .
Sami al Hajj ’s treatment at the hands of U.S. authoities is not unusual .
The 275 - odd prisoners still confined at Guantanamo are just the beginning .
Reprieve , one of the few organizations which will advocate for “ enemy combatants ” estimates that 14,000 men are imprisoned in secret American jails , caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare of bureaucratic doublespeak , without legal recourse or even simple hope , and in far worse conditions than Guantanamo .
Which brings me back to Maclean ’s , The National Post and other media organizations which tilt rightward .
How many column inches did the magazine , or any other media outlet in Canada devote to the story of Sami al - Hajj , or to any of the thousands languishing in secret prisons , or even on the concerted attack on civil rights in this country in the past year ?
Instead we receive lengthly sermons on the supposed threat to individual liberty posed by those firebrand , authoritarian - minded human rights commissioners — a danger that in any reasonable analysis is negligable and in any case easily fixed , at least compared to the hysterical morass of anti-terrorist measures .
Free speech is integral to civil liberties .
But does anyone seriously think Mark Steyn ’s right to free speech and Maclean ’s right to publish this speech was ever in jeopardy ?
There is a certain gap in credibility , where the rightwing press can mouth pieties about free speech while wilfully ignoring more egregious violations of human rights .
Apparently the rights of well - connected pundits and the corporate media are sacrosanct .
Everyone else can go rot .
One suspects under different circumstances the hue and cry might be different and –let ’s say it softly –another agenda might be at work .
Fulminations against the imposition of the War Measures Act in 1970 and the civil rights iniquities of Pierre Trudeau are still regular fodder for pundits even now , twenty - four years after Trudeau left office .
Under the present government , not to mention the Bush Administration , similar abuses of power , and worse , are given a pass .
It should not be forgotten either that human rights commissions have been intensely disliked by conservatives since their inception .
They interfered with property rights , said conservatives , or religious or personal belief , and they even proposed the hackneyed arguments that more appropriate remedies were to be found in the market place or the civil courts .
( Let pass that not so long ago racial and religious discrimination was justifed by Holy Writ , and that the poor and marginalized have n’t the money to buy their way out of discrimination or launch a lawsuit . )
However unjustified the proceedings against Steyn and Maclean ’s , their cause has become a vehicle to attack the HRCs in general as inquisitional bodies hellbent on destroying individual liberty , whether the facts bear this interpretation or not .
Lastly , can it be that the conservative media has bought the government ’s position that the threat of Islamic terrorism is so overwhelming that the safety of all is worth the sacrifice of a few civil liberties and the notion of due process ?
Subtext : the story is already done ( though the abuses continue , ) the debate is over , and who really cares if a few grubby Muslims are caught up in the net .
Complicity with the authoritarian ’s eternal cry of safety trumping freedom or even silence becuase one has common cause with the ruling party ’s ideology , is a dangerous game for the conservative press .
At best it exposes the rhetoric around freedom of speech for what it is — rubbishy cant .
In the long view , secrecy , arbitrary proceedings , extraordinary renditions and the rest of it are the antithesis of democratic society , for ultimately all of these are the root of corruption of power and the seeds of tyranny , where no accountibility is possible : a no man ’s land where predators roam freely .
The contrast with the much - maligned human rights commissions , with their insistance on due process and open proceedings , accompanied by a vigourous debate on their purpose and relevance , could not be greater .
It is a contrast worth pondering .

Former deputy prime minister John Prescott has confessed to suffering from the eating disorder bulimia .
He told BBC News 24 that he suffered in misery and in silence for 10 years because of the shame of being a high - profile man with the illness .
He writes in the Sunday Times that he would gorge on food and then vomit .
Mr Prescott explains how he could " sup a whole tin of condensed milk " , eat trifles " for ever " and eat through a Chinese restaurant 's entire menu .
The 69 - year - old told the BBC : " I never admitted to this out of the shame and embarrassment .
" I found it difficult as a man like me to admit that I suffered from bulimia - the doctors told me that it was probably due to stress .
An eating disorder can affect anyone at any age , it is n't just young girls , it 's boys and men as well
Susan Ringwood , Beat " I eventually managed to control it and to stop it a few years ago . "
Mr Prescott emphasised part of his motivation for the revelation was to de-stigmatise the illness and encourage others to seek help .
He said : " I want to say to the millions of people , do take advice , it can help and it can help you out of a lot of misery that you suffer in silence . "
Bravery
He writes in the Sunday Times : " People normally associate it with young women - anorexic girls , models trying to keep their weight down - or women in stressful situations , like Princess Diana . "
Health experts praised Mr Prescott for his confession .
Susan Ringwood , chief executive of the eating disorders charity Beat , told Radio 5 Live that bulimia was not only suffered by young women .
It 's hard enough for a young girl to confess to , but for a high - profile male politician approaching 70 , it 's especially impressive
Dr Ty Glover
She said : " We do know that an eating disorder can affect anyone at any age , it is n't just young girls , it 's boys and men as well , so in that sense it was n't a surprise .
" And neither was it a surprise that someone felt they really needed to keep this a secret , and even say they felt ashamed of themselves .
" And that feeling can stop people getting help . "
Consultant psychiatrist Dr Ty Glover , an eating disorders specialist at Cheadle Royal Hospital in Cheshire , said : " It 's hard enough for a young girl to confess to , but for a high - profile male politician approaching 70 , it 's especially impressive .
" It seriously makes me think that maybe we 're completely missing a whole audience of middle - aged men who are too scared to admit they have a problem . "
Dr Glover said one in 10 sufferers were male and that Mr Prescott 's brave admission should encourage other men to seek help .
What I did was stuff my face with anything around , any old rubbish , burgers , chocolate , crisps , fish and chips , loads of it , till I felt sick
John Prescott Mr Prescott , who stepped down from Labour 's front bench last year after ten years as deputy PM , said people would never suspect he suffered from the disorder and that some could accuse him of not being " a very successful bulimic " because his weight did not drop .
He said he began binging and vomiting during his years in the shadow cabinet in the 1980s , but the condition got worse when Labour came to power in 1997 .
" So what I did was stuff my face with anything around , any old rubbish , burgers , chocolate , crisps , fish and chips , loads of it , till I felt sick - but at least I 'd had the pleasure of stuffing my face and feeling really full .
" Then there would be a weird kind of pleasure in vomiting and feeling relieved . "
Secret eating
He continued : " I could sup a whole tin of Carnation condensed milk , just for the taste , stupid things like that .
Marks & Spencer trifles , I still love them , one of my favourites .
I can eat them for ever .

" Whenever I go to Mr Chu 's in Hull , my favourite Chinese restaurant in the whole world . . .
I could eat my way through the entire menu . "
He speaks of trying to hide his bulimia from colleagues and his wife , Pauline .
" I thought , of course , I was being clever , and no - one would ever know , but Pauline realised in the end .
The signs in the toilet gave it away , and all the missing food . "
Seventeen years ago Mrs Prescott persuaded her husband to get help from the House of Commons doctor and he was sent on to a consultant .
My weight , though , is still over 15 stone - as I do love my food - but I try not to snack between meals and to eat at sensible times
John Prescott " I turned up and found his waiting room full of young women .
I was the only man there .
I felt a right twerp .
Luckily none of them shopped me to the press .
" Perhaps they thought I was on a fact - finding mission , never for one moment thinking that a man of my age and build could be suffering from bulimia nervosa , but that 's what the consultant said I had . "
He received treatment , but he continued to be bulimic when he became deputy prime minister in 1997 .
But now he says he has not suffered from the disorder for a year and exercises in the gym for 45 minutes a day .
" My weight , though , is still over 15 stone - as I do love my food - but I try not to snack between meals and to eat at sensible times . "
Mr Prescott , who also has diabetes , is now supporting the National Health Service 's awareness campaign on food disorders .

What are these ?
I wonder if the author is certain about this :
On Being Certain : Believing You are Right Even When You are Wrong :
The day after the 1986 Challenger shuttle accident , psychologist Ulric Neisser asked 106 students to write down exactly where they were and what they were doing when they first heard about the explosion .
When he interviewed the students two and a half years later , 25 percent of them gave strikingly different accounts .
But when confronted with their original journal entries , many students defended their beliefs .
One of them answered , “ That ’s my handwriting , but that ’s not what happened . ” ...
Robert A. Burton tries to get to the bottom of the curious sensation he calls the “ feeling of knowing ” — being certain of a fact despite having no ( or even contrary ) evidence .
Throughout his book , Burton makes the compelling argument that certainty “ is neither a conscious choice nor even a thought process . ”
Instead , he says , that unmistakable sense of certainty “ arises out of involuntary brain mechanisms that , like love or anger , function independently of reason . ”
Burton thinks that just as we perceive our external world through our physical senses , our internal world presents itself in the form of feelings , such as familiar or strange and correct or incorrect .
And he shows that these inner perceptions are necessary for us to function properly in everyday life , because our thoughts are subject to constant self - questioning .
For example , even though reason may tell us that running up a tree to escape a lion is an excellent strategy , experience shows that great strategies can fail and that there may be better options .
Because alternative choices are present in any situation , logical thought alone would be doomed to a perpetual “ yes , but ” questioning routine .
Burton reasons that it is the feeling of knowing that solves this dilemma of how to reach a conclusion .
Without this “ circuit breaker , ” indecision and inaction would rule the day .
One of the startling implications of Burton ’s thesis is that we ultimately cannot trust ourselves when we believe we know something to be true .
“ We ca n’t afford to continue with the outdated claims of a perfectly rational unconscious or knowing when we can trust gut feelings , ” he writes .
...
He was right .
It was hard to believe .
Not only was the prospect of two Brandons marrying each other surreal ( his boyfriend , who was then 24 , is named Brandon Lehr ) , but Brandon A. did n’t strike me as the marrying type .
Not at this point in his life , anyway .
An outgoing , freethinking art student in his last year at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston , he seemed far too busy DJ’ing at eclectic dance parties and breaking into construction sites for his installation art projects to worry about marriage .
Image VASSILI & MARC : Engaged .
Vassili , 24 , and Marc , 24 , still live with their parents , who for months didnt know about their sons impending nuptials .
Credit ... Erwin Olaf for The New York Times
Marc , a dental - office manager who still lived at home with his parents in a Boston suburb , did n’t call to tell me about his engagement .
I learned about it instead on Facebook , when , with little fanfare , he changed the relationship status on his profile from “ In a Relationship ” to “ Engaged . ”
He had been dating his fiancé , Vassili Shields , who was then 23 , for a year .
“ Are you actually engaged , ” I called to ask Marc , “ or is that just your way of saying you really like Vassili ? ”
He replied that he was , in fact , engaged .
They planned to marry in a few months .
I did n’t know what to make of these engagements  or of my subsequent discovery that more than 700 gay men 29 or younger had married in Massachusetts through last June , the latest date for which numbers are available .
On the one hand , I wondered why these guys were marrying so young .
What was the rush ?
It seemed to me that one of the few advantages of being young gay men  until gay marriage was legalized in Massachusetts , at least  was that we were institutionally protected from ever appearing on “ Divorce Court . ”
But I could also relate to young gay men yearning for companionship and emotional security .
Had gay marriage been an option when I was 23 and recently out of the closet , I might very well have proposed to my first gay love .
Like many gay men my age and older , I grew up believing that gay men in a happy long - term relationship was an oxymoron .
( I entered high school in 1989 , before gay teenagers started taking their boyfriends to the prom . )
If I was lucky enough to find love , I thought , I ’d better hold onto it .
And part of me tried , but a bigger part of me wanted to pitch a tent in my favorite gay bar .
I was n’t alone .
Everywhere I looked , gay men in their 20s  or , if they had n’t come out until later , their 30s , 40s and 50s  seemed to be eschewing commitment in favor of the excitement promised by unabashedly sexualized urban gay communities .
There was a reason , of course , why so many gay men my age and older seemed intent on living a protracted adolescence :
We had been cheated of our actual adolescence .
While most of our heterosexual peers had experienced , in their teens , socialization around courtship , dating and sexuality , many of us had grown up closeted and fearful , “ our most precious and tender feelings rarely validated or reflected back to us by our families and communities , ” as Alan Downs , the author of “ The Velvet Rage : Overcoming the Pain of Growing Up Gay in a Straight Man ’s World , ” puts it .
When we managed to express our sexuality , the experience often came booby - trapped with secrecy , manipulation or debilitating shame .
No wonder , then , that in our 20s so many of us moved to big-city gay neighborhoods and aggressively went about trying to make up for lost time .
And no wonder that some of us  myself included  occasionally went overboard .
OTTAWA  First Maxime Bernier lost his girlfriend .
Then he lost his job as Canada ’s minister of foreign affairs .
Mr. Bernier ’s political and personal setbacks are directly related .
His former romantic interest , Julie Couillard , was linked to Quebec ’s motorcycle gangs , which have long tried to infiltrate politics and the justice systems .
On Monday night , Mr. Bernier resigned shortly before Ms. Couillard disclosed in a heavily promoted television interview that he had left confidential government documents in her suburban Montreal apartment .
Although Prime Minister Stephen Harper cited only that bit of carelessness as the reason for accepting Mr. Bernier ’s resignation , the minister ’s departure was widely viewed in Canada as a response to the political fallout from the relationship and to Mr. Bernier ’s tendency to make diplomatic blunders .
Biker gangs in Mr. Bernier ’s home province of Quebec have , among other things , killed prison guards and shot one prominent crime journalist .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton used her big win in West Virginia on Tuesday to make her case that she has a better chance of beating the Republicans in the general election .
Sen . Hillary Clinton told supporters Tuesday that she believes she 's the stronger candidate .
" I am more determined than ever to carry on this campaign , " she told supporters in Charleston , West Virginia .
" I am in this race because I believe I am the strongest candidate .
... I can lead this party to victory in the general election if you lead me to victory now . "
With half of the results in , Clinton was ahead of Sen. Barack Obama by a margin of more than 2 - 1 .
Clinton has faced calls to drop out of the race because she trails Obama in delegates won , states won and the popular vote this primary season .
Clinton also now trails Obama when it comes to the support of superdelegates , and her campaign is $ 20 million in the red .
Howard Wolfson , Clinton 's communication director , said the New York senator is " in until the very end . "
Watch Clinton say she 's determined to go on »
" We think we 're going to be the nominee .
We 're going to make our case to the superdelegates , " he said .
In an e-mail to supporters , the Clinton campaign called West Virginia a " tremendous victory . "
" It 's clear that the pundits declaring this race over have it all wrong .
The voters in West Virginia spoke loud and clear -- they want this contest to go on . "
Clinton 's win wo n't do much to cut into Obama 's lead :
West Virginia had just 28 delegates at stake , and those will be awarded proportionately .
Her campaign argues that she can catch Obama in the popular vote by turning out the vote in the remaining five contests .
Clinton has also continued to tout her electability , saying she 's more fit to go up against Sen.
John McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee , in November .
" I 'm winning Catholic voters and Hispanic voters and blue - collar workers and seniors , the kind of people that Sen.
McCain will be fighting for in the general election , " Clinton said earlier .
Watch campaign aide discuss Clinton 's electability »
Reiterating a point she has made frequently while campaigning in West Virginia , Clinton pointed out Tuesday that no Democrat has won the White House since 1916 without winning West Virginia .
Bill Clinton won there in 1992 and 1996 .
George W. Bush took the state in 2000 and 2004 .
Watch analysts predict what comes after West Virginia »
In addition to West Virginia , Clinton 's campaign points to other swing states she has won -- like Ohio and Pennsylvania -- as they try to woo superdelegates to their side .
" They have changed some minds , but more minds have been changed right now in favor of Sen. Obama , " CNN contributor Donna Brazile said .
Obama surpassed Clinton in the race for superdelegates Monday .
Clinton led by more than 100 at the beginning of the year .
Obama appeared to be looking ahead of Tuesday 's vote toward a general election fight with McCain as he campaigned in Michigan and Missouri .
Read how the candidates are turning their attention to the fall »
" There 's a bipartisan tradition in foreign policy that we should try to recapture .
Unfortunately , John McCain is not going to provide that , " Obama said in Cape Girardeau , Missouri .
Both Obama and Clinton have softened their attacks on each other in recent days .
Obama has turned his attacks to McCain , and Clinton spoke favorably of Obama in her victory speech Tuesday .
Still , exit polls from West Virginia indicate a strong division among Democrats .
Almost as many of Clinton 's West Virginia supporters would vote for McCain as would for Obama , the polls show .
If Obama were the Democratic nominee , 36 percent of Clinton supporters would vote for him in the fall , the polls found .
But 35 percent said they 'd cast their vote for McCain instead .
A bare majority of his West Virginia supporters -- 51 percent -- said they would back Clinton in the fall , but 31 percent said they 'd vote for McCain .
After West Virginia , the campaign trail moves to Kentucky and Oregon , which vote in one week .
Clinton is expected to do well in Kentucky , but Obama is the favorite to win Oregon .
All About U.S. Presidential Election • West Virginia
By LAURIE KELLMAN , Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON – Attorney General Michael Mukasey refused Friday to refer the House ’s contempt citations against two of President Bush ’s top aides to a federal grand jury .
Mukasey said White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former presidential counsel Harriet Miers committed no crime .
As promised , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she has given the Judiciary Committee authority to file a lawsuit against Bolten and Miers in federal court .
“ The House shall do so promptly , ” she said in a statement .
Mukasey said Bolten and Miers were right in ignoring subpoenas to provide Congress with White House documents or testify about the firings of federal prosecutors .
“ The department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute Mr. Bolten or Ms. Miers , ” Mukasey wrote Pelosi .
Pelosi shot back that the aides can expect a lawsuit .
“ The American people demand that we uphold the law , ” Pelosi said .
“ As public officials , we take an oath to uphold the Constitution and protect our system of checks and balances and our civil lawsuit seeks to do just that . ”
The suit had a political purpose too .
Democrats have urged that the filing occur swiftly so that a judge might rule before the November elections , when all 435 House seats and a third of the Senate are up for grabs .
Criticism of Bush ’s use of executive power is a key tenet of the Democrats ’ platform , from the presidential race on down .
The House voted two weeks ago to cite Bolten and Miers for contempt of Congress and seek a grand jury investigation .
Most Republicans boycotted the vote .
Pelosi requested the grand jury investigation on Thursday and gave Mukasey a week to reply .
She said the House would file a civil suit seeking enforcement of the contempt citations if federal prosecutors declined to seek misdemeanor charges against Bolten and Miers .
The plaintiffs would be the entire Judiciary Committee , who would be represented by the House ’s lawyers , according to aides to Pelosi and committee Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich .
Mukasey took only a day to get back to her .
But he had earlier joined his predecessor , Alberto Gonzales , in telling lawmakers they would refuse to refer any contempt citations to prosecutors because Bolten and Miers were acting at Bush ’s instruction .
A civil suit would drag out a slow - motion crawl to a constitutional struggle between a Democratic - run Congress and a Republican White House that has been simmering for more than a year .
Democrats say Bush ’s instructions to Miers and Bolten to ignore the House Judiciary Committee ’s subpoenas was an abuse of power and an effort to block an effort to find out whether the White House directed the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 for political reasons .
Republicans call the whole affair a political game and walked out of the House vote on the contempt citations in protest .
The 223-32 House vote on a resolution approving the contempt citations Feb. 14 was the first of its type in 25 years .
The White House pointed out that it was the first time that such action had been taken against top White House officials who had been instructed by the president to remain silent to preserve executive privilege .
In his letter , received by the House early Friday evening , Mukasey pointed out that not only was Miers directed not to testify , she also was immune from congressional subpoenas and was right to not show up to the hearing to which she had been summoned .
“ The contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an executive branch official who asserts the president ’s claim of executive privilege , ” Mukasey wrote , quoting Justice policy .
“ Accordingly , ” Mukasey concluded , “ the department has determined that the noncompliance by Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers with the Judiciary Committee subpoenas did not constitute a crime . ”
Though they were not surprised , Democrats reacted to Mukasey ’s letter with outrage .
“ Today ’s decision to shelve the contempt process , in violation of a federal statute , shows that the White House will go to any lengths to keep its role in the U.S. attorney firings hidden , ” said Conyers .
“ In the face of such extraordinary actions , we have no choice but to proceed with a lawsuit to enforce the committee ’s subpoenas . ”

この記事は、先日開催し た 第 3 回 RHGの逆襲 のまとめみたいなものである。と、同時に『初めてのRuby(仮題) 』の宣伝である。
クラス、その例外、そのトリック
Rubyはクラスベースのオブジェクト指向だから、メソッドの情報はクラスに属している。インスタンスメソッドを呼び出すときには、そのオブジェクトの属するクラスを調べて、そのクラスの持っているインスタンスメソッドの中から探す。
でも、Rubyの場合は例外がある。1つはモジュール。モジュールはクラスではないのに、でもインスタンスメソッドを提供している。1つは特異メソッド。特異メソッドは特定のインスタンスに直接所属するメソッドだ。
でも、ここには実装上のトリックがある。Rubyにとってはモジュールのインスタンスメソッドも特異メソッドも、等しくクラスに属するインスタンスメソッドなんだな。
モジュー ル
モジュールをクラスにincludeすると、Rubyは内部的にモジュールの「身代わり」となるクラスを作成する。RHGではこれを「化身クラス」と呼んでいるので、以下ではそれにならう。
化身クラスはメソッド表( 名前からメソッド本体を参照するHash )をモジュールと共有している。だから、モジュールが提供するのと同じインスタンスメソッドを提供していると言える。
include が行われたタイミングで 、Rubyはクラスの継承ツリーにこの化身クラスを挟み込む。
class Cattle ; end class Yapoo < Cattle include FlowerGlowable end
みたいなケースを考えよう。今、モジュール FlowerGlowable の化身クラスを FlowerGlowable′ と書くことにする 。
include するまでは Yapoo の親クラス は
Cattle だ。 include すると、 Cattle の子は FlowerGlowable ′ 、 FlowerGlowable ′ の子が Yapoo という構造になる。この構造は 、 Yapoo.ancestors みたいなのを実行すると見て取ることができる。
特異クラ ス
特定のオブジェクトだけ、他の同輩たちには無い特別なメソッドを持たせたいと思ったらどうするだろう。特異メソッドとは要するにそういうものだ。
C++だったら、特別なメソッドを持った子クラスを作ってSingletonパターンを適用するというやりかたが選択肢に挙がるだろうなと思う。Rubyの特異クラスとはそれ、そのものだ。
クラス Yapomb のインスタンス kayo に特異メソッドを定義すると、 Yapomb を継承した新しいクラス ( kayo ) を作る。そして、新しいクラスにインスタンスメソッドを定義する。これが特異メソッドの正体である。
それか らRubyは、インスタンス kayo が所属するクラスを新しいクラス ( kayo ) に書き換える。そして、ここでいう新しいクラス、のことを特異クラスと呼ぶ。特異クラスを inspect する とRubyでは #< Class :#< Yapomb:0xXXXXXX @name = " kayo " >>
みたいに表示されるけれども、ここではRHGの表記に倣って ( kayo ) のように表記する 。

特異クラス地位向上運動
特異メソッドを実装するのに特異クラスを使う必要はないし、Matzは当初は他の案も検討していたらしいと聞いた。例えば、直接オブジェクトにメソッド表を持たせても良いわけだ。
つまり、特異クラスという存在 はMatz's Ruby Implementationの実装の詳細であり、Rubyの公式な仕様ではない。RHGにはそう書いてある。
でもなー、特異クラスは非公式という前提は特異メソッド定義式を導入した時点で破綻していると思う。既に、私みたいな特異クラス好きの間ではclass
<< obj ; self end として特異クラスを取り出すイディオムは常識なわけで 、Railsでも随分使われている。そこで、 [ ruby - dev:34191 ] みたいな提案も出てくるわけだ。
クラスメソッ ド
ついでに言えばクラスメソッドとは、クラスの、
Class オブジェクトとしての特異メソッドである。別の言い方をすれば
Class クラスを継承した特異クラスのインスタンスメソッドである。
クラスの特異クラス、これはクラスのクラスだからメタクラスと呼んでも差し支えない。Ruby界の英語ではmetaclass , singleton class , eigenclass という述語が混乱しているけれども、私としては次のように提唱したい。
任意のオブジェクトに対して、その特異クラスのことを英語でeigenclassと呼ぶ
Class オブジェクトのeigenclassのことをmetaclassとも呼ぶ
メタ、メタ、メ タ
metaclassもまたオブジェクトであり、特に kind_of ?
Class である。では、metaclassのクラスは ?
つまり、metametaclassの正体は何者か。
この意味では 星さんの記事 は誤解を与える恐れがある 。
class << obj ; end
この式の意味するところは、
objの特異クラスの定義を開始する
objが特異クラスを持っていなければ(普通のクラスに直接属しているなら)、新たに特異クラスを作成する
だ。
従って、それまで独自の特異クラスを持っていなかったオブジェクトも特異クラスを持ってしまう。つまり、今オブジェクトが真に属しているクラスはこのイディオムでは取得できない。
ちなみに、真に属する、とか言ってるのは、
Object#class や Class #superclass のようなメソッドは特異クラスや化身クラスをスキップしてその親クラスを返すせいだ。これらの特殊なクラスはRubyレベルでは原則として目に見えなくて、操作できないのだ。
evil - ruby というgemがある 。DLライブラリの力を借りてスーパークラスの書き換え、所属しているクラスの書き換えと言ったRubyが禁止している動作を無理矢理実現してしまう邪悪なgemだ。
これを使えば「真の」所属クラスも取得できるんじゃね? と、 RHGの逆襲 第 3 回 で言った。
でも、今調べたらその機能はなかったのでevil-rubyにパッチを書いた。あとで本家に送っとく。次のメソッドを足した。
「 真の」所属クラスを取得す る Object#actual_class
actual_class を使ってメタクラス階層を遡っていく Object#classification
を使ってメタクラス階層を遡っていく 「 真の」スーパークラスを取得する Module#actual_superclass
それを使って「真の」先祖を取得する Module#actual_ancestors
evil - ruby は1.9対応が完全ではないので、ついでに
Class クラスの処だけ直しておいた。
メタ階層連 鎖
修正版evil - rubyと次のスクリプトを使って階層を辿った。
require ' ./ evil ' class Cattle ; end class Yapoo < Cattle ; end [ Yapoo , Class , Object ] .each do | start | puts " #{ start.
inspect } : " puts " \t ancestors : " start.ancestors.each do | klass | print " \t\t # { klass.
inspect } , meta's : " p klass .
classification end puts " \t meta's " start.classification.each do | klass | print " \t\t # { klass.
inspect } , ancestors " p klass.actual_ancestors end end
オブジェクト-クラス-メタクラス-メタメタクラスの階層を辿るとこうなる。これはRuby
1.8の場合だが、1.9の場合でも BasicObject が入るだけで基本的に変わらない。
つまり、初期状態ではメタメタクラスというものは定義されていないんだな。メタクラスに対して特異メソッドを定義しようとしたとき、初めてメタメタクラスみたいなものが作成されて、その場合は星さんの記事の通り1.8と1.9で挙動が異なる。

……というようなネタを交えつ つRuby入門するための入門書『初めてのRuby(仮題)』を書いた。さすがに、入門書なのでここまで深く突っ込んではないけど、その分だけ解説も上記よりは少し丁寧なはず。
で、本はオライリー・ジャパンより動物本の1冊として6月に刊行される予定である。動物は未定みたいだけど、Rubyコミュニティから希望を出したら反映される余地ってあるのかな?
聞いてみよう。
それにしても、一昨日脱稿してようやく自分がいかに緊張していたか気がついた。初の書籍執筆だもん。正直、今になって「あー、こっちの解説のほうが良かった」とか言う点も出てきている。もう少し肩の力を抜いて書ければ良かったかな。
これらの改善点は可能なら初校段階で入れるし、「(ただでさえスケジュール圧してるので)無理」と言われたらこのサイトでフォローアップしていくつもり。
Code Complete is one of the greatest books ever written on the subject of shipping software .
There is a reason it is subtitled “ A Practical Handbook of Software Construction : ” Every page is loaded with insights and practices that can help you be a better developer , help your team be a better team , help your manager be a better manager , and help your organization ship software .
The wisdom about code style , quality , and review will pay for the book many times over .

Python ’s significant whitespace is a good example of this .
By enforcing a standard indentation , Python says that indentation is n’t worth thinking about : everybody does it one way , and that ’s a benefit for readability .
Compare and contrast this to a hypothetical language Imperitivity .
Imperitivity does not have anonymous functions or closures as first - class objects , and many Imperitivity programmers argue that they should not be added to the language because that would be bad style , or it would promote inconsistent style with some people using closures and some not .
Would we seriously equate the two positions ?
I think not : whitespace really is pretty trivial : the fact that we can write a script or IDE plug - in to “ fix ” indentation to match a style guide is evidence that it should not take up valuable team and management attention .
However , the question of whether a code base should include closures , should not include closures , or ought to enforce a consistent approach to closures is important .
Using a language to settle the question is an abrogation of responsibility : the matter should be decide by the team or technical leadership and enforced through review , mentoring , training , example code , and so forth .
The salient difference is that while consistent indentation is useful , indentation itself is unimportant in comparison to other technical choices the team must make .
Important choices , such as the appropriate paradigms or idioms to use , ought to be decided by the team and enforced through review .
I have read an argument that a programming language can enforce good programming style by restricting programmers to constructions and mechanisms that are deemed worthy , or perhaps are restricted to a small set so that there is an enforced consistency in a code base .
( I am not talking about using compilers to detect bugs or memory management being used to prevent bugs , I am talking about programming languages that do not permit certain kinds of abstractions outright ) .
The premise of the argument is that if programmers are constrained to a single , universal “ good style , ” good programs will result .
In many other forms of management , people have attempted to automate the manager out of a job .
There is an idealistic notion that if we write just the right series of instructions for people , if we build the perfect instruction manual , if we detail every possible case and script every possible behaviour , we can build a team that always does the right thing .
We see that in highly industrialized occupations like preparing fast food : there is a detailed , step - by - step instruction for everything , and employees simply follow the rules .
Many things have been written about whether that works or does n’t work for software developers .
I am now talking about why that does n’t work for teams , for team leaders , and for development managers .
Every thing you put in place in an attempt to enforce good behaviour takes something away from the team ’s responsibility to manage the process using judgement .
We joke about a compiler generating a false sense of security : it compiles , so it must work .
But that is exactly the mind set of choosing a language on the basis of it actively preventing poor style : we are choosing it because it will relieve us of the work of manually reviewing code and analysing whether it is of good style or not .
It will relieve us of the work of setting a good example and evangelizing good code .
It will relieve us of the work of teaching , of leading , or managing .
In the fast food example , we know that the “ managers ” in the restaurants are not true managers .
They have little or no authority to deviate from the rules .
And for that reason , they have little or no accountability for what results : you can fire them for failing to follow the rules , but if they follow the rules and bad things happen , it is the rules that are at fault , not the manager .
And so it is with enforcing “ good style ” with a programming language .
If someone writes code in that language , they are absolved from all responsibility for its style .
And so is their manager : the programmer ’s code compiled , it is demonstrably free of bad style , what can we demand of their manager other than to see to it that they use the language ?
Software development is a young profession .
We do n’t know an awful lot about what works and what does n’t work .
but I ’ll take a stand here :
We humans have an awful lot of experience with the relationship between authority and responsibility .
And what we have learned is that if we remove an individual ’s authority to choose , we absolve them of responsibility for the result , and ultimately performance suffers greatly even if their skills are objectively high .
Does this mean that automation is bad ?
Why do we use high level languages and compilers ?
Why do we use libraries and frameworks ?
Do n’t those tools also relieve us of responsibility ?
Well yes , of course they do .
They relive us of responsibility for things we have deemed not to matter .
For the vast majority of lines of code , the exact translation to CPU op codes is unimportant , as long as it works .
Nobody cares to look under the hood .
Compilation is the process of automating the accidental complexity of our CPU .
If you choose to use a programming language with lazy evaluation , you have decided that evaluation order is an accidental complexity that no longer matters to you , and you want the language to sweep it out of sight .
What we choose to automate speaks to what we consider irrelevant .
As long as it works , we do n’t care how it ’s done .
So when we automate style , we are deciding that style dos n’t matter .
As long as it passes the compiler , it is good style .
Automating good style ultimately weakens the notion of individual and shared code ownership , it emphasizes the notion that if it passes the gate , it must be good .
That , in turn , creates the illusion that no further inspection is required .
If it functions as we require , and it is written in the language that enforces good style , why do we need to review it ?
We can talk about why role of a programming language should be to enable good style , and have a terrific debate about what that means and which languages do a good job with it .
But it is more important to keep our eye on the ball .
The most important factor for the success of software projects is still the people .
And what makes people produce good software ?
Taking responsibility for their work .
Ownership and accountability .
Ownership and accountability is weakened when you attempt to constrain the programmer and it is enhanced when you provide a programmer with freedom and follow up with review .
Thus , my question : Whatever happened to code reviews ?
Mysteriously , four spacecraft that flew past the Earth have each displayed unexpected anomalies in their motions .
These newfound enigmas join the so - called " Pioneer anomaly " as hints that unexplained forces may appear to act on spacecraft .
A decade ago , after rigorous analyses , anomalies were seen with the identical Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft as they hurtled out of the solar system .
Both seemed to experience a tiny but unexplained constant acceleration toward the sun .
A host of explanations have been bandied about for the Pioneer anomaly .
At times these are rooted in conventional science — perhaps leaks from the spacecraft have affected their trajectories .
At times these are rooted in more speculative physics — maybe the law of gravity itself needs to be modified .
Now Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomer John Anderson and his colleagues — who originally helped uncover the Pioneer anomaly — have discovered that four spacecraft each raced either a tiny bit faster or slower than expected when they flew past the Earth en route to other parts of the solar system .
' Humble and perplexed '
The researchers looked at five deep - space probes — Galileo to Jupiter , the NEAR mission to the asteroid Eros , the Rosetta probe to a comet , Cassini to Saturn , and the MESSENGER craft to Mercury .
Each spacecraft flew past the our planet to either gain or lose orbital energy in their quests to reach their eventual targets .
In five of the six flybys , the scientists have confirmed anomalies .
" I am feeling both humble and perplexed by this , " said Anderson , who is now working as a retiree .
" There is something very strange going on with spacecraft motions .
We have no convincing explanation for either the Pioneer anomaly or the flyby anomaly . "
In the one probe the researchers did not confirm a noticeable anomaly with , MESSENGER , the spacecraft approached the Earth at about latitude 31 degrees north and receded from the Earth at about latitude 32 degrees south .
" This near - perfect symmetry about the equator seemed to result in a very small velocity change , in contrast to the five other flybys , " Anderson explained — so small no anomaly could be confirmed .
The five other flybys involved flights whose incoming and outgoing trajectories were asymmetrical with each other in terms of their orientation with Earth 's equator .
For instance , the NEAR mission approached Earth at about latitude 20 south and receded from the planet at about latitude 72 south .
The spacecraft then seemed to fly 13 millimeters per second faster than expected .
While this is just one - millionth of that probe 's total velocity , the precision of the velocity measurements was 0.1 millimeters per second , carried out as they were using radio waves bounced off the craft .
This suggests the anomaly seen is real — and one needing an explanation .
The fact this effect seems most evident with flybys most asymmetrical with respect to Earth 's equator " suggests that the anomaly is related to Earth 's rotation , " Anderson said .
As to whether these new anomalies are linked with the Pioneer anomaly , " I would be very surprised if we have discovered two independent spacecraft anomalies , " Anderson told SPACE.com .
" I suspect they are connected , but I really do not know . "
Unbound idea
These anomalies might be effects we see with an object possessing a spacecraft 's mass , between 660 and 2,200 lbs. ( 300 and 1,000 kg ) , Anderson speculated .
" Another thing in common between the Pioneer and these flybys is what you would call an unbound orbit around a central body , " Anderson said .
" For instance , the Pioneers are flying out of the solar system — they 're not bound to their central body , the sun .
For the other flybys , the Earth is the central body .
These kinds of orbits just do n't occur very often in nature — it could be when you get into an unbound orbit around a central body , something goes on that 's not in our standard models . "
The researchers are now collaborating with German colleagues to search for possible anomalies in the Rosetta probe 's second flyby of the Earth on November 13 .
" We should continue to monitor spacecraft during Earth flybys .
We should look carefully at newly recovered Pioneer data for more evidence of the Pioneer anomaly , " Anderson added .
" We should think about launching a dedicated mission on an escape trajectory from the solar system , just to look for anomalies in its motion . "
Montana State University physicist Ronald Hellings , who did not participate in this study , said , " There 's definitely something going on .
Whether that 's because of new physics or some problem with the model we have is yet to be worked out , as far as I know .
A lot of people are trying to look into this . "
Anderson and his colleagues will detail their latest findings in an upcoming issue of the journal Physical Review Letters .
“ My eyes rolled immediately when I heard what the model was , ” says Webster of Johns Hopkins , who is studying the Baltimore project .
Webster knew the forces the interrupters were up against and considered it wishful thinking that they could effectively mediate disputes .
“ But when I looked closer at the data , ” Webster continues , “ and got to know more about who these people were and what they were doing , I became far less skeptical and more hopeful .
We ’re going to learn from it .
And it will evolve . ”
George Kelling , a Rutgers professor of criminal justice who is helping to establish an effort in Newark to reduce homicide , helped develop the “ broken window ” theory of fighting crime : addressing small issues quickly .
He says a public - health model will be fully effective only if coupled with other efforts , including more creative policing and efforts to get gang members back to school or to work .
But he sees promise in the CeaseFire model .
“ I had to overcome resistance , ” Kelling told me , referring to the introduction of a similar program in Newark .
“ But I think Slutkin ’s on to something . ”
Most of the police officials I spoke with , in both Chicago and Baltimore , were grateful for the interrupters .
James B. Jackson , now the first deputy superintendent in Chicago , was once the commander of the 11th district , which has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the city .
Jackson told me that after his officers investigated an incident , he would ask the police to pull back so the interrupters could mediate .
He understood that if the interrupters were associated with the police , it would jeopardize their standing among gang members .
“ If you look at how segments of the population view the police department , it makes some of our efforts problematic , ” Baltimore ’s police commissioner , Frederick H. Bealefeld III , told me .
“ It takes someone who knows these guys to go in and say , ‘ Hey , lay off . ’
We ca n’t do that . ”
Like many new programs that taste some success , CeaseFire has ambitions that threaten to outgrow its capacity .
Slutkin has put much of his effort on taking the project to other cities ( there ’s interest from Los Angeles , Oakland and Wilmington , Del. , among others ) , and he has consulted with the State Department about assisting in Iraq and in Kenya .
( Cease Fire training material has been made available to the provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq . )
Meanwhile , their Chicago project is underfinanced , and the interrupters seem stressed from the amount of work they ’ve taken on .
THE INTERRUPTERS have certain understandings .
At the Wednesday meetings , no one is ever to mention anyone involved in a dispute by name or , for that matter , mention the name of the gang .
Instead they refer to “ Group A ” or “ Group B . ”
They are not investigators for the police .
In fact , they go out of their way to avoid knowing too much about a crime .
When Highsmith and Prater left me the night of the failed drug deal , they began working their contacts .
Highsmith found someone who knew one of the stickup men and who , at Highsmith ’s request , negotiated with them .
Highsmith ’s contact persuaded the robbers to return enough of the money to appease the drug - buyer ’s anger .
When I met with the intermediary a few weeks after things were resolved , he was still stirred up about the robbery .
“ I was mad enough to do anything , ” he told me , making it clear that he and his friends had been hunting for the stickup guys .
“ This could ’ve been a hell of a lot worse than it was . ”
To this day , neither Highsmith nor Prater know the identities of anyone except the intermediary  and they want to leave it that way .
The interrupters often operate by instinct .
Cease
Fire once received a call from the mother of a 15 - year - old boy who wanted out of a gang he joined a few weeks earlier .
The mother told Hoddenbach and another interrupter , Max Cerda , that the gang members chased her son home every day from school threatening to beat him .
They had shot at him twice .
Hoddenbach found the clique leaders and tried to talk sense to them .
If the boy did n’t want to be in the gang , he told them , he ’d be the first one to snitch .
The gang members saw the logic behind that but insisted on giving him a beating before releasing him .
Hoddenbach then tried another tack : he negotiated to let him leave the gang for $ 300  and no thrashing .
The family , though , was only able to come up with $ 50 , so Hoddenbach , Cerda and another interrupter came up with the rest .
At their next Wednesday meeting , some interrupters were critical of Hoddenbach for paying what they considered extortion money .
“ It was kind of a messed - up way , but it was a messed - up way that works , ” Hoddenbach said .
It was nearly three months before Charles Mack could find time to visit Frederick , the young shooting victim .
Frederick had since moved in with his great - grandmother in a different part of town .
In his old neighborhood , he told Mack , “ there always somebody who knows you .
And I had a reputation . ”
He complained to Mack that he had never been interviewed by the police but then declared he would never identify the person who shot him anyway .
“ I ’m going to leave it alone , ” he said .
As is so often the case , Frederick could n’t remember the genesis of the disagreement between his clique and the other .
Mack promised to stay in touch , and as we dropped him off , Mack turned to me and said , “ I think he ’s going to be all right . ”
It sounded like both a proclamation as well as hopeful aside .
Not long ago , I stopped by to visit with Hoddenbach at the Boys and Girls Club , where he holds down a second job .
It was a Friday evening , and he was waiting for an old associate to come by to give him an introduction to a group of Hispanic kids on the far North Side .
Apparently , earlier in the week , they bashed in the face of an African - American teenager with a brick .
From what Hoddenbach could make out , it was the result of a long - simmering dispute  the equivalent of a dormant virus  and the victim ’s uncle was now worried that it would set off more fighting .
As we sat and talked , Hoddenbach seemed unusually agitated .
His left foot twitched as if it had an electric current running through it .
“ If these idiots continue , ” he told me , “ somebody ’s going to step up and make a statement . ”
Britain 's climate change emissions may be 12 % higher than officially stated , according to a National Audit Office investigation which has strongly criticised the government for using two different carbon accounting systems .
There is " insufficient consistency and coordination " in the government 's approach , the NAO said .
Using one system , which the government presents to the UN and in public , Britain emitted 656 m tonnes of CO2 in 2005 , and claims an improvement on 1990 figures .
However , the lesser - known but more accurate data in the government 's national environmental accounts show emissions to be in the region of 733 m tonnes in 2005 , a NAO report says today .
" There are two different bases on which the government reports emissions : that required for the UN , and the environmental accounts prepared for the Office of National Statistics ... [ which are ] more comprehensive as they include aviation and shipping emissions .
They present UK progress in reducing emissions in a markedly different light " , says the report .
The report says there have been " no reductions in UK emissions " if measured by the national accounts method .
The figures contained in the report fly in the face of consistent government claims that it is reducing emissions .
Last week the environment minister , Phil Woolas , said in a Commons written answer : " UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 16.4 % since 1990 .
We remain on course to nearly double our Kyoto Protocol target over the 2008 - 12 period . "
Last night opposition parties and environment groups accused the government of misleading the public at a time when the UK claims to be leading the world in achieving reductions .
" This report raises profound questions about the credibility of the government 's approach to reducing carbon emissions .
In the absence of reliable and honest reporting the results could be potentially disastrous " , said Peter Ainsworth , shadow secretary of state for the environment .
" Labour 's claim that Britain 's carbon footprint is shrinking is a scam .
The figures on aviation are being fiddled , meaning the government can give the green light to airport expansion without most of the subsequent rise in emissions being counted " , said Robin Oakley , of Greenpeace .
The 40 - page NAO report found that government departments interpreted data in different contexts and for different purposes , " in one case within the same document on successive pages " .
The report said the government 's many targets and timetables for reducing different combinations of greenhouse gases were confusing .
The UK has a Kyoto target of 12.5 % reduction in all greenhouse gases by 2012 , an EU target of reducing 20 - 30 % of CO2 , three domestic goals ranging between 20 - 60 % of CO2 and is in the process of drafting a new climate change bill .
" The targets can be assessed against different bases .
There is " considerable scope " for aggregating and presenting data in different ways " , the NAO said .
WASHINGTON  Key backers of ethanol fuel are starting a push to double the amount of ethanol commonly blended with gasoline to 20 % .
The move would boost the market for grain alcohol , while skirting problems and controversy surrounding E85 , an 85 % ethanol fuel .
Blending ethanol — alcohol typically now made from corn — into gasoline is a way to cut petroleum use .
A 10 % ethanol blend , called E10 , now is standard at many gasoline pumps across the USA .
It can be used by virtually all gasoline vehicles , which is not true of the E85 being promoted as a fuel of the future .
Studies by the University of Minnesota and Minnesota State University at Mankato suggest that ordinary vehicles could burn a mix of 20 % ethanol , called E20 , as routinely and harmlessly as they now burn E10 .
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty is to announce the study results at a conference here today .
" We see E20 not exactly as bypassing E85 , but supplementing it , " says Gene Hugoson , Minnesota agriculture commissioner .
A separate study , commissioned by the Renewable Fuels Association and not yet finished , will assess the environmental impact of doubling the alcohol .
Minnesota law requires 20 % of fuel used be ethanol within a few years , making the matter more urgent there than elsewhere .
The mandate could be satisfied if enough motorists burn E85 to raise the average to 20 % — or if E20 replaces E10 as the state 's standard fuel .
Hitting the state 's goal , as well as boosting U.S. ethanol use as much as the industry hopes , " will take awhile " relying on E85 , Hugoson says .
E85 availability remains limited mainly to the Midwest .
It is potentially corrosive , making it hard to ship in pipelines and requiring special fuel system parts in vehicles .
E85 also has far less energy than gasoline , so it takes more to go the same distance .
For E20 to become a legal fuel , however , it would need U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approval .
Automakers also have doubts that it is as benign as E10 .
They are running trials , but they say they do not have enough data on how risky E20 is to components and whether it would change emissions in unwanted ways .
" Our vehicles are able to handle E10 , but to move to E20 there are technical issues .
It 's not that simple , " says Ford Motor ( F ) spokeswoman Kristen Kinley .
General Motors ( GM ) spokesman Alan Adler says that in E20 tests in Australia , " 40 % of the vehicles sustained ( catalytic converter ) damage , which allowed essentially unchecked tailpipe emissions . "
" We believe there 's not data sufficient to prove that all vehicles will function OK with E20 , " says Reg Modlin , director of environmental affairs for Chrysler .
" It 's not a legal fuel , and it would void the warranty . "

Best broadband deals
Best broadband deals – cheap broadband or Free Sky TV ?
Working from home on the internet , one thing you absolutely have to to depend upon is a reliable and fast broadband connection .
It ’s a serious matter to consider changing Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) and start looking around for the best broadband deals .
For example it ’s no use being a cheapskate and putting up with an average or poor service when it comes to having an efficient tool for the trade .
On the other hand , whilst the cheap broadband options are sure to be compromised at some point , the most expensive broadband is n’t always the best broadband .
I mentioned on twitter that I ’m looking for the best broadband deals and was then recommended Tiscali .
I found out that my current ISP has actually been taken over by a company which has been subsequently bought up by Tiscali , so I ’m already a customer of theirs by default , yet their website tells me my phone line is ineligible ?!
Shifting Marketplace for cheap broadband
This is a constant change scenario .
A few years back I was lucky enough to live in an area where the revolutionary Homechoice were piloting a new service .
This included fast 1 Mb broadband internet at a time when everywhere else was limited to 256 or 512 K , bundled in with an on demand TV via copper wire ( almost IPTV ) which was superb in functionality .
As a broadband service provider this was easily the best deal available but they never managed to raise the cash to buy enough content to take off .
That was before the unbundling of the local loop for telecomms , so BT were able to hold things back for them .
Unfortunately Homechoice pulled out of my area when they moved on to the next generation of the IPTV service , and have since been acquired by O2 .
So I would not recommend using any of the smaller companies because you never know who you are going to end up with .
Free SKY TV
This history means that I am amenable to the idea of fast broadband internet being bundled in with a TV service , which is why I ’m looking at SKY digital TV and broadband .
The interesting broadband deal on offer currently is the basic SKY TV and broadband package for £ 16 .
You can look at that as either a free SKY TV service , bundled in with what you would normally pay for cheap broadband only , or as a free broadband offer for people who have always wanted the huge number of extra TV channels .
If you have internet access out at work and mainly only use the home connection for browsing in the evenings and weekends then the best broadband deal is probably the SKY broadband Base package , whereas a home business worker or gamer would probably need to upgrade to the even faster speeds with totally unlimited bandwidth for an extra £ 5 or £ 10 a month .
SKY + and SKY HD
I ’m not that bothered about the additional entertainment channels on offer at £ 1 a bundle , nor the premium films or live football but I must admit I ’ve always been interested in the huge number of niche channels which become available free to air , upon becoming a SKY subscriber .
Turkish TV , Punjab , Arabic and NTV for a start , and then the enormous back catalogue of nature documentaries and comedy which are not always available anywhere on freeview for example .
And the geek in me is dying to have a play with the extra technology that can be added as a one - off .
The SKY PLUS ( SKY + ) box which gives TIVO like functionality ( pause and replay live TV , record one or two channels while watching something else ) and clever software to record linked series .
The Sky Multiroom client server network could be fun or the High Definition TV Sky HD box .
There ’s not much point in getting the HDTV though without getting a new TV set to do it justice , but if a new TV is on the cards then it might be worth making sure the best wiring and connections are installed ready for it as part of the setup deal .
Best Broadband Deals
Back to the broadband though , which could be the real justification for subscribing to SKY .
I ’ve noticed that the free basic broadband package is at 2 M egabits per second , which is actually twice as fast as my old Homechoice connection used to be .
The one that everybody envied .
So that might well suffice given that a lot of what I do is text and graphic based interaction and browsing .
It ’s probably only if a lot of large downloads or streaming video are required that the upgrades would be required , but that ’s completely flexible on a month by month basis anyway , so for the advantage of getting all those extra TV channels , functionality and gadgets the free broadband ‘ base ’ has to be one of the best broadband deals around .
That ’s without even mentioning the free weekend and evening telephone calls , cheaper than BT Together for calls to mobiles and international numbers , nor the “ SKY Anywhere via TV ” on - demand service which is included with any SKY + box .
Reservations
My only reservations are that satellite TV is perhaps not the future .
In the longer run , some people think that TV channels wont exist in the present format at all .
It will all be “ on demand ” so nobody is ever watching the same programme at the same time .
But the availability of on - demand music has n’t killed radio has it ?
I have a theory that channels will be with us for a long time to come , alongside all of the personalised browsing , on - demand , skip and fast forward stuff .
Besides it ’s still the best broadband deal that is the main consideration for business , with the free Sky TV as a nice bonus for myself .

According to a study by the Institute for Market Research commissioned by the daily Leipziger Volkszeitung , one out of three Germans does not trust their country 's style of federalist democracy .
Even fewer have faith in the system of social market economy .
The study , published on Tuesday , April 22 , comes on the heels of a speech by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , calling for business leaders to shore up the economic system many say contributed to the country 's " economic miracle " after World War II .
Based on responses of some 1,000 participants across the country , the study showed a regional difference in perceptions of German democracy .
In western Germany , 64 percent believe democracy is operating as it should , while in the nation 's eastern states , that number is 44 percent .
Germany 's police got top marks in the poll
Faith in the German government and the political parties seems to have suffered most among the population : 38 percent believe in the German government , and only 22 percent in the parties represented in parliament .
Police are popular , so is love
The strength of the market is a different story .
In western Germany , 51 percent believe in the power of the German market economy and 43 percent think the social welfare system is up to par .
In eastern Germany , those numbers are decidedly lower : 33 percent and 30 percent , respectively .
The study showed that Germans appear to have the most faith in their police force .
Some 85 percent of those surveyed think the work police do is satisfactory .
Some 62 percent are content with the justice system , and 64 percent said they find the reporting by German television acceptable .
Love still rules among many Germans
Germans ' outlook on daily life was the subject of a survey published Tuesday by the online version of Der Spiegel newsweekly .
Nearly 80 percent of all Germans said they begin their day with confidence .
And over 80 percent of men and women believe in " true love , " according to the survey .
The magazine 's poll looked at everything from when Germans go to bed at night , to whether they sing in the car when alone or would sleep with their partner 's best friend , to how much time they take -- on average -- to eat breakfast in the morning .
In - Depth Look at Clean Sewage Tech
March 17th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
There ’s been a lot of focus on renewable energy on Cleantechnia recently but energy is not the only “ clean ” tech out there .
What about recycling wastes ?
What about recycling … human wastes ?
What ’s the difference between traditional wastewater treatment and sewage purification ( also known as ‘ indirect potable water reuse ” ) ?
Is it safe and cost - effective ?
And does it smell like … you know … ?
Turns out , it ’s a lot cleaner than you think .
Let ’s get the “ yuck ” factor out of the way .
If you ’ve ever passed a waste water treatment plant on a hot day , you probably got a whiff of what we ’re talking about : the result of all our glorious indoor plumbing .
Traditional waste - water treatment has one main goal : “ reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level nature can handle . ”
When they ’re done filtering out most of the undesirables , they release it into a waterway – in fact most major waterways .
These traditional plants handle everything that goes down the drain : sewage , runoff , litter , chemicals , and even medication .
This cloudy mix includes dreaded disease - causing bacteria but also nutrients , minerals and metals .
Here are the basic steps for normal waste water treatment :
1 ) Screen and Grind : Everything that washes into our sewers is supposed to end up at the plant .
This includes sticks , trash , and plenty of “ unmentionable ” solid particles .
The first step to treatment is to grind everything down to a manageable size .
Now the pipes wo n’t get backed up ( that ’s one hell of a clog ) and the next steps can work their magic .
2 ) Separation :
The next step is to separate the grease and solid particles from the more manageable waste water .
Everything sits quietly in a tank ( or perhaps moves slowly through pipes ) until the most difficult ingredients , called “ sludge ” can be skimmed off the top and bottom .
These require special treatment .
Anaerobic bacteria and sometimes caustic chemicals are used to decompose sludge .
The bulk of wastewater , now deemed “ clear , ” ( but not clean ) moves on to the next major step .
3 ) Micro Dine - In : The “ clear ” wastewater is fed to bacteria that happily eat organic materials .
There are many different ways to feed these helpful bacteria , but the result is always the same : the organic material is digested away , leaving disease - causing bacteria , nutrients , and other chemicals behind .
Now the waste water moves on to the final stage before being released into a river or ocean .
4 ) Final Treatment : Plants must disinfect the wastewater before releasing it back into a waterway .
Chlorine or ultraviolet light work best , but neither are cheap .
Too much chlorine can damage natural habitat , and ultraviolet light requires a lot of energy .
In most wastewater treatment plants this is the last stage , meaning many nutrients , metals , and medication have not been scrubbed from the wastewater .
Some plants also employ “ Advanced Treatment ” that removes excess nutrients , like nitrogen or phosphorous , from the water .
This step protects natural habitat because excess nutrients cause “ dead zones . ”
( For more information on these wastewater processes , click here . )
But what about “ sewage purification ” ?
On January 10 , 2008 Orange County , California began full - scape operation of an “ ‘ indirect potable water reuse ” plant which removes * ahem * impurities from sewage to extract potable water .
They then pump that purified water back into aquifers to replenish the drinking - water supply .
Some people are a little wary .
Are they drinking their own “ impurities ” ?
How safe is it ?
And what does it cost ?
A quick look at the technology should put some of these fears to rest :
1 ) Micro Filter :
All water is gently pumped through special filters – only objects smaller than about two - tenths of a micron may pass .
That ’s smaller than many bacteria ( including the disease - causing kinds ) , and obviously the larger solids we usually associate with sewage .
But have no fear , the water is not yet “ clean ” .
The filters are cleared every twenty minutes and all pipes are cleaned weekly to ensure purity .
The solids ( sludge ) from this process are piped to an existing traditional waste treatment plant for decomposition .
2 ) Reverse Osmosis : High - pressured pumps force the filtered effluent through several layers of thin plastic .
This scrubs “ viruses , salts , pesticides and most organic chemicals ” out of the water .
Now all that ’s left are a few organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals .
Not to worry , the next step is equal to the task of removing even these hearty offenders .
3 ) UV Bath : Powerful UV lamps react with hydrogen peroxide ( added in the water ) to fry the rest of the impurities .
Now we ’re getting some clean water .
Plant officials claim that the result is cleaner than bottled water , and they ’re right .
The purified water is then pumped back into the aquifer , ready for use .
Designers claim they have planned and installed numerous fail - safe designs into the system to prevent anything unwanted from passing through their system .
But what about the cost ?
This plant , the largest of its kind in the world , cost $ 480 million .
But pricing a traditional waste treatment plant is tricky because it depends on the size , location , and methods used .
The Northend Wastewater Treatment Plant cites $ 38 million for a “ conventional treatment system ” but fails to mention details .
Nevertheless , given the gap between these estimates , I think it ’s safe to assume that sewage purification is pricey .
The cost of this kind of plant may only be rivaled by the cost of piping water across long distances or difficult terrain .
The benefit of recycling water is that you reduce your dependence on local water supplies , which are not always reliable .
The drought in the southeast United States has spurred Georgia to reconsider the state line .
My hometown of Chattanooga , TN replied by declaring “ Give our Georgia Friends a Drink Day ” , and delivered bottled water to Atlanta in a truck dutifully escorted by a Davy Crockett .
All joking aside , water is a serious issue around the world .
Orange County itself is rightfully worried about its water supply .
Ron Wildermuth of the Orange County Water District told Living on Earth , “ Because of growing population , we knew that we needed to put more water in the groundwater basin . ”
Their new facility pumps 700 million gallons of clean water back into the aquifer ( not directly to homes ) each day ; that ’s enough water for the daily needs of about 500,000 people .
“ It will give us a supply unaffected by drought , ” Mehul Patel , Orange County Water District ’s principal process engineer , told C&EN .
Though successful , the idea has n’t caught on .
Proposals in other states have met with resistance from residents and politicians .
The cost and “ yuck factor ” are the leading complaints against indirect potable water reuse .
To put the whole issue into perspective , traditional waste water plants release non-potable water into rivers everyday .
Cities and towns downstream are already cleaning that water to make it safe for drinking .
Sewage purification , though expensive , cuts out the middle man .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
ROME ( Reuters ) - Silvio Berlusconi has won his third Italian election with a bigger than expected swing to the centre right , but the media magnate said it would not be easy to solve deep economic problems .
Votes were still being counted on Tuesday , but with Berlusconi ’s victory clear on Monday evening , centre - left leader Walter Veltroni called the 71 - year - old to concede defeat .
After two years in opposition , Berlusconi is expected to return to Rome from his home in northern Italy later on Tuesday , although for procedural reasons he is unlikely to be appointed prime minister before early May .
A strong mandate should enable Berlusconi to push reforms through parliament , but many Italians are disillusioned with politics and doubt any government can quickly cure the ills of Italy ’s fourth - largest economy .
“ The months and years ahead will be difficult and I am preparing a government ready to last five years , ” Berlusconi told state television in a live phone call on Monday night .
He said his priorities were settling the future of state - controlled Alitalia , which the outgoing administration was struggling to privatize , and clean up a long - standing garbage crisis in Naples .
Berlusconi ’s pledges include cutting taxes while reducing public debt , liberalizing the economy and getting tough on crime .
But critics say he failed to carry out pledges to revolutionize Italy when prime minister for seven months from April 1994 and from 2001 - 2006 .
SURPRISE WINNER
Pollsters ’ projections , based on partial results , gave Berlusconi a 99 - seat majority in the 630 - member lower house and an advantage of up to 30 seats in the Senate , which has 315 elected and seven lifetime senators .
That contrasts with the two - seat Senate majority that the last government had under Romano Prodi , who resigned in January 20 months into his five - year term .
Berlusconi had set his sights on a 20 - seat majority in the Senate .
A surprise winner in the election was Berlusconi ’s junior coalition partner , the anti-immigration Northern League which doubled its result over the 2006 election to around 8 percent .
That result will help strengthen Berlusconi ’s majority , but analysts said it might give the League ‘ kingmaker ’ powers .
“ They are going to raise their price for cooperation , ” said Gian Enrico Rusconi , a politics professor at Turin university .

“ I do n’t think a Berlusconi government will be capable of pushing through the reforms that Italy needs .
The Northern League is a protectionist party . ”
Berlusconi promised the League at least two cabinet seats .
The election win means Berlusconi , an ally of U.S. President George W. Bush , will host the third G8 summit of his career when the leaders meet in Italy in 2009 .

Berlusconi said he wanted Franco Frattini , currently in charge of justice and security policy at the European Commission , for foreign minister and that Gianfranco Fini , his last foreign minister , would preside over the lower house of parliament .
Giulio Tremonti is likely to be named economy minister , Berlusconi has said .
The big loser of the election was the left .
Excluded from Veltroni ’s Democratic Party , the Rainbow Left , made up of communists and greens , fared so badly it may not win any seats .
With many smaller parties facing a similar fate , Christian Democratic chief Pierferdinando Casini said parliament may have only five parties , compared with some 20 last time -- a major turnaround for Italy ’s traditionally fragmented politics .

News in Science
Early Americans chomped on seaweed
Chewed - up or burned seaweed discarded more than 14,000 years ago confirm that people were in Chile at least that long ago and sheds light on what their culture was like , researchers report .
The findings at a site 16,000 kilometres from the Bering Strait add to an almost overwhelming pile of evidence that people were well distributed across the western Americas long before the so - called Clovis culture 13,000 years ago .
And the seaweed picked up at the Monte Verde site provides a direct link to people living in the area today , some of whom also use seaweed medicinally .
" What we have found ... are nine species of seaweed that are coming from rocky and sandy beaches located about 55 kilometres west of the site , " says archaeologist Professor Tom Dillehay of Vanderbilt University in Nashville , who led the study published today in the journal Science .
" It indicates to us that the people of Monte Verde had a much stronger coastal industry than we thought previously .
It indicates to us that we might be talking about people who initially entered into the Monte Verde site from the Pacific coastline itself , " he says .
Controversial
The Monte Verde site 800 kilometres south of Santiago has long been controversial .
It was discovered in 1977 and its contents have been carbon - dated to more than 12,000 years ago , dates that careful calibration using tree rings and other information suggest are actually more than 14,000 years old .
This clashes with the one - time conventional wisdom that humans first crossed from Siberia using a land bridge over the Bering Strait about 13,000 years ago and then spread over the Americas .
But it supports newer genetic , linguistic and physical evidence that suggest this migration took place earlier , at least 16,000 years ago .
And it shows the upper layer of the site was occupied more than 1000 years earlier than any other reliably dated human settlements in the Americas .
Dillehay believes it supports his theory that early Americans moved slowly down the Pacific coast , learning about the local flora , fauna and other resources as they explored .
They would have moved inland a bit as they encountered raging , turbulent rivers full of melted snow from glaciers .
Older theories have focused on a human blitzkrieg , in which fast - moving groups spread over the continent quickly as they tracked and wiped out herds of big game .
Seaweed cakes
Some of the seaweed had been pressed into cakes and chewed as quids , like tobacco is sometimes today .
Others had clearly been cooked , Dillehay and colleagues say .
" All nine seaweed species recovered at Monte Verde II are excellent sources of iodine , iron , zinc , protein , hormones , and a wide range of trace elements , particularly cobalt , copper , boron , and manganese , " they write .
At least two of the species are used medicinally by local indigenous people to treat chest and intestinal ailments , Dillehay says .
He says it might be possible to take DNA from the chewed quids , but notes they are highly likely to have been contaminated since they were collected .
Last month , researchers reported they had analysed DNA from 14,000 year old human waste found in a cave in Oregon .
The conservative columnist Robert D. Novak , who often reflects views from inside the Bush administration , wrote Thursday in The Washington Post that there was “ puzzlement over Clement ” and an expectation “ in government circles ” that the solicitor general would “ amend his position when he actually faces the justices . ”
Those who have watched the 41 - year - old Mr. Clement , a veteran of nearly four dozen arguments who enjoys the respect of justices across the ideological spectrum , think it most unlikely that he would bow to pressure of this sort .
“ Do n’t count on it , ” Martin S. Lederman , a Georgetown University law professor and former Justice Department lawyer , wrote on the Web site Scotusblog , adding that “ the institutional cost to the office of such a reversal ” would be high .
However it eventually plays out , the inside - the - administration drama underscores a point that has largely been lost in the run-up to the argument in this high - profile case : a ruling that the Constitution guarantees an individual as opposed to a collective right to gun ownership would be far from the end of the age - old debate over the meaning of the Second Amendment .
To borrow from Winston Churchill , it would only be the end of the beginning .
The court would then have to move to the next stage , defining what an individual right actually entails and what government regulations it permits .
In constitutional analysis , this is where the rubber meets the road .
For every constitutional right , the court chooses a standard of review , essentially a determination of how high a bar the government has to clear in order to justify a regulation impinging on the right .
“ Strict scrutiny , ” the most protective standard , accorded to rights the court deems “ fundamental , ” almost always dooms to failure an effort at government regulation .
The briefs on the individual - rights side of this case , District of Columbia v. Heller , No. 07-290 , argue for applying strict scrutiny , and it is Mr. Clement ’s refusal to embrace that standard that has caused such consternation .
The government ’s brief argues for judicial review that would be “ heightened ” but not strict , employing a sliding scale that balances the impact that any restriction might have on the “ protected conduct ” of private gun ownership against “ the strength of the government ’s interest in enforcement ” of the restriction .
The District of Columbia ’s law “ may well fail such scrutiny , ” the brief observes .
To its opponents , the District of Columbia law means that “ individuals may never possess a functional firearm at home , ” in the words of the brief filed for the plaintiff , Dick Anthony Heller .
He is a security guard who carries a gun on duty at the building on Capitol Hill that houses the administrative offices of the federal judiciary .
His request for a permit to keep the gun in his Capitol Hill home for self - defense was turned down .
About one percent of the Web pages being delivered on the Internet are being changed in transit , sometimes in a harmful way , according to researchers at the University of Washington .
In a paper , set to be delivered Wednesday , the researchers document some troubling practices .
In July and August they tested data sent to about 50,000 computers and discovered that a small number of Internet service providers ( ISPs ) were injecting ads into Web pages on their networks .
They also found that some Web browsing and ad - blocking software was actually making Web surfing more dangerous by introducing security vulnerabilities into pages .
" The Web is a lot more wild than we originally expected , " said Charles Reis , a PhD student at the University of Washington who co-authored the paper .
The paper , which was co-written by a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute , will be delivered at the Usenix Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation in San Francisco .
To get their data , the team wrote software that would test whether or not someone visiting a test page on the University of Washington 's Web site was viewing HTML that had been altered in transit .
In 16 instances ads were injected into the Web page by the visitor 's Internet Service provider .
" We 're confirming some rumors that had been in the news last summer , that ISPs had been injecting these ads . "
The service providers named by the researchers are generally small ISPs such as RedMoon , Mesa Networks and MetroFi , but the paper also named one of the largest ISPs in the U.S. , XO Communications , as an ad injector .
An XO spokesman said that the company does not engage in this practice and that any ad- injection linked to its network is probably being done by a " downstream " service provider that is purchasing network capacity from XO .
In June 2007 the TechCrunch blog reported RedMoon , a small Texas wireless provider , was using a system built by a Redwood City , California , company called NebuAd to insert advertising into the HTML code of Web pages .
Critics blasted the ISP for meddling with its customers ' traffic and worried that this kind of ad injection undermined the integrity of Web sites , which had no control over the ads being displayed .
NebuAd has now discontinued its ad- injection product line and now delivers only the standard type of advertising that it buys from Web publishers , a company spokesman said Tuesday .
The data also shows that pages were sometimes changed by popup blockers within products such as CheckPoint 's ZoneAlarm or CA 's Personal Firewall , but also that some products actually inserted security vulnerabilities into the pages they processed .
Even Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser is part of the problem , the researchers claim .
IE injects HTML into pages that it saves to the computer 's hard drive , making those pages vulnerable to attacks when the page is then reloaded from the local disk .
The paper 's authors characterized their work as a first step and said that more study would be required to get a clearer picture of what exactly is going on within the many networks that make up the Internet .
" One of the next steps for the community is to create better and stronger mechanisms for understanding what is happening , " said Tadayoshi Kohno , an assistant professor with the University of Washington .
" The Web is still very young and we just do n't know what 's going to happen next . "
A 1976 triptych painting by Francis Bacon brought a whopping $ 86.28 million Wednesday night at Sotheby ’s big spring contemporary art sale .
It was a record for the artist at auction and , seemingly , a retort to doomsayers who had predicted that the art market would falter seriously this season because of broad economic anxieties .

Everyone in Sotheby ’s cavernous salesroom was on the edge of their seats when “ Triptych , 1976 , ” a vast ( each of the three panels measures about 6.5 by 5 feet ) and densely painted allegorical subject , came up for sale .
Echoing multiple themes in Greek mythology , it depicts a Promethean headless body being attacked by a bird of prey in the central panel ; in the panel to either side , a blurred face looms , bearing witness to the violence .
It was being sold by the Moeuix family , producers of Château Petrus wines .
Hailing the painting as “ a landmark of the 20th - century canon , ” Sotheby ’s had estimated it would sell for $ 70 million ; the hammer price was $ 77 million .
( Final prices include the commission paid to Sotheby ’s : 25 percent of the first $ 20,000 , 20 percent of the next $ 20,000 to $ 500,000 and 12 percent of the rest .

ROME ( Reuters ) - Harry ’s Bar , the famed Venice watering hole where Ernest Hemingway held court over hearty food and stiff martinis , is offering a discount to “ poor ” Americans suffering from a weak dollar and subprime blues .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The decision by the owner of the restaurant , one of the most expensive even when the U.S. currency is strong , underscores the growing concern about the weak dollar among tourism operators in Italy and elsewhere in Europe .
A sign posted outside the restaurant at the weekend reads :
“ Harry ’s Bar of Venice , in an effort to make the American victims of subprime loans happier , has decided to give them a special 20 percent discount on all items of the menu during the short term of their recovery . ”
When the euro was introduced as the continent ’s common currency in 2002 , a dollar bought about 1.10 euros .
Today it gets about 64 euro cents , making prices seem astronomically high for most Americans .
“ Since the start of January , we noticed a drop in ( American ) customers of between five and 10 percent and now that we are in April its looks really frightening , ” Arrigo Cipriani , 76 , Harry ’s owner , told Reuters by phone from Venice on Monday .
ENIT , Italy ’s national tourism board , said in a report this month that the “ strong devaluation of the dollar compared to the European currency and signs of a recession are currently the greatest obstacle to American tourism toward Europe . ”
Harry ’
Bar was founded in 1931 when Giuseppe Cipriani , a barman at a Venice hotel , opened it with money an American named Harry Pickering had given him to pay off a loan .
He named the bar and his first son Arrigo ( Italian for Harry ) -- the current owner -- in Pickering ’s honor .
Hemingway made Harry ’s Bar his Venice headquarters .
He mentioned it in “ Across the River and Into the Trees , ” which was published in 1950 and which he wrote on the lagoon island of Torcello while living in an inn owned by the Cipriani family .
Cipriani , whose family company owns high - end restaurants and food shops in New York , Venice , Hong Kong , London and Sardinia , says even well - heeled clients look for discounts .
“ You would be surprised how people like to have a discount on their bill whether they are rich or poor , ” he said , adding that a full meal with wine at his Venice restaurant could set someone back more than 200 euros ( $ 314.5 ) .
Cipriani , who said the discount will apply only to the restaurant part of the tab and not the bar , said Americans in Venice need not bring their passports to his restaurant in order to get a discount .
“ We will judge by the accent and if we make a mistake , we will give a 20 percent discount to the English as well , ” he said .
On Sunday , May 25 , the Mars Phoenix Lander will plunge through the red planet 's atmosphere in search of water – and possibly look for evidence of life on Mars .
In less than two weeks , the Mars Phoenix Lander could realize scientists ' long - delayed dream of directly finding Martian ice for the first time .
To date , the evidence for water on Mars has been indirect .
And while the Phoenix Lander is n't specifically looking for life , the lander 's instrumentation may also find evidence of extraterrestrial organisms .
" If we 're successful , this mission will be remembered for being the first to do direct analysis of ice or water on the surface of Mars , " said NASA 's Mike Gross , who engineered the mission 's scientific instrumentation .
" We 'll dig through the topsoil layers and ice to learn ... whether that environment is or was possibly suitable for microorganisms to grow and reproduce . "
The $ 420 million Phoenix mission is also the first to have its own Twitter feed , which has been sending out updates as the Phoenix approaches Mars .
The lander has traveled nearly 120 million miles since its August 2007 launch .
On May 25 , it will attempt a landing inside an area about twice the size of Hong Kong , a mere 2,000 square kilometers .
An animation of the Mars Phoenix Lander 's entry , descent , and landing .

The new NASA mission comes after two major setbacks for Martian landers .
NASA 's Mars Polar Lander mission disappeared in January 1999 after arriving at the planet , and the European Space Agency 's Beagle 2 , which was designed to search for signs of life , met the same fate on Christmas Day in 2003 .
After these two failed missions , NASA cancelled the Mars Surveyor in 2001 and mothballed the lander .
That lander , newly outfitted and upgraded , became the Phoenix .
With the difficult history of lunar missions in mind , the Phoenix team , which has been working on the project for more than five years , will experience some difficult moments as the lander descends , followed by the watchful cameras of the planet 's three current orbiters .
" Mars is a pretty dangerous place to visit and landing is always the most tense moment , " Gross said .
" In the landing , there are no second chances . "
Once on the ground , the lander will only have access to a 160 - square - foot patch of Martian land within reach of its robotic arm .
Within that bedroom - size sample , the lander 's arm and array of scientific instruments will dig into the ground of the polar icecap , looking for a history of water and possibly life .
" We can potentially identify organic molecules , " Gross explained .
" We can identify molecules that have hydrogen and carbon in them , but the goal of the mission is not to look for life . "
While the Viking missions of the 1960s dashed hopes that Mars is home to pervasive life , scientific momentum has been building that life could have existed in Mars ' distant past , when it is believed that liquid water persisted on the planet .
At the same time , evidence has been mounting that extremophile life can find a way to survive almost anywhere water exists .
Microorganisms called psychrophiles live in temperatures as low as negative 12 degrees Celsius .
Although the surface of Mars is known to be considerably colder than that , some scientists have theorized that the subsurface of the planet could harbor liquid water , providing habitat for life .
" There 's this idea that there are reservoirs of liquid water down there and as soon as you see liquid water , you say , ' Why could n't there be microbes ? ' " said Edward Young , the principal investigator of the UCLA IGPP Center for Astrobiology .
( Young is not involved with the Phoenix mission . )
In addition to analyzing ice and looking for the ingredients of life , the Phoenix mission is likely to shed light on the climactic history of Mars as well as its present - day weather .
Along with its robotic arm and molecular analyzers , it also has a weather station and an imaging instrument that can snap two one - megapixel images that can be merged into stereoscopic photos .
The dune - buggy - size lander and all of its instruments are powered by a large set of solar panels that charge lithium - ion batteries .
All of the data and images that the lander is collecting will be relayed at a maximum of about 15 kilobytes a second to the Mars Odyssey and Reconnaissance orbiters in the UHF band , which will beam the data back to Earth .
The mission is slated to last for about 90 days , or until the Martian winter freezes the lander , ending its working lifespan .
The Phoenix mission is the first of a number of relatively modest missions to Mars .
It is the result of collaboration between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Lockheed - Martin and the University of Arizona .
Together , they beat out two dozen other proposals for NASA grant money under the Mars Scout Program , and with the start of the mission mere days away , spirits are running high on the team .
" From the payload standpoint , I 'm very confident that we 'll be successful , " Gross said .
X86 Opcode and Instruction Reference
This reference is intended to be precise opcode and instruction set reference ( including x86- 64 ) .
Its principal aim is exact definition of instruction parameters and attributes .
Quick Navigation
coder32 , coder32 - abc , geek32 , geek32- abc
coder64 , coder64 - abc , geek64 , geek64- abc
coder , coder-abc , geek , geek - abc ( these contain both x86 - 32 and x64 instructions ) .
In contrast to other references , primary source of this reference is an XML document , which guarantees clear and structured information base and therefore ability to extract many various informations such as a list of instructions from requested groups , etc .
The reference is primarily based on Intel manuals as Intel is the originator of x86 architecture .
Additionally , it describes undocumented instructions as well .
On appropriate places , it gives a notice if an opcode act differently on AMD architecture .
Support for Cyrix , NexGen etc. specific instructions is not scheduled at all .
HTML Editions
These editions are available at the moment :
The coder suite is intended to more common use and contains the following editions : coder32 , coder64 , and coder ( sorted by opcode ) , and coder32 - abc , coder64 - abc , and coder-abc ( sorted by mnemonic ) .
The geek suite is intended for deeper research of x86 architectures ' instruction set .
This includes geek32 , geek64 , and geek editions ( by opcode ) and geek 32 - abc , geek 64 - abc , and geek - abc editions ( by mnemonic ) .
More on the purpose and use of this suite see close below .
Do n't get confused by geek ( - abc ) and coder ( - abc ) editions .
Both of them contains instruction set of both x86 - 32 and x86 - 64 architectures .
If you do n't have a particular reason to use them ( such as to view the differencies between the architectures ) , the other editions would probably suit you better .
Editions coder32 a geek32 relate exclusively to x86 - 32 architecture .
Similarly , editions coder64 and geek64 relate exclusively to x86 - 64 architecture .
The following chart illustrates the differencies between editions for current release :

The Purpose of Geek Editions in Short
The geek editions contains as much complete information from the source XML document as possible .
That 's why they may seem quite unclear .
You appreciate them only if you need to get to know the instruction set deeply or if you investigate the source XML and you need to visualize it better .
These editions use specific operand codes ( which are described in Instruction Operand Codes chapter below ) .
These codes may look strange and obscure at the first sight .
The reason to use them is that they hold more information than the more common ones .
One example can be operand combination rAX , imm16/32 , such as in instruction ADD rAX , imm16/32 in coder64 edition .
One can determine that the destination operand is either ax , eax , or rax , and the source one is either imm16 or im m 32 .
A problem arises when one needs to determine what magic is behind rax , imm32 combination .
If one is just getting started with x64 architecture , it is not clear how exactly is 32 - bit immediate added to 64 - bit rax .
This question is answered by corresponding geek edition , ADD rAX , Ivds in geek64 edition .
The immediate value is encoded there using Ivds code .
I code means Immediate , v means word or doubleword ( imm16 or im m 32 ) .
The most important part is ds code , which means doubleword , sign - extended to 64 bits for 64 - bit operand size .
Now is it clear .
As for Itanium - specific instructions , they are added just for the sake of interest - they give a notice that the appropriate opcodes are already used .
Hypertext Reference to Particular Opcode
If you want to refer to particular opcode ( in any edition ) , e. g. , 0FA0 PUSH FS , it can be easily achieved this way :
ref.x86asm.net/geek.html#x0FA0
( try it )
It works for opcode extension similarly , e. g. , 83 /7 CMP :
ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html#x83_7
( try it )
Using HTML Editions
Since HTML editions can look complicated at first sight , here goes an outline how to work with them .
Following examples come from coder32's edition because it is easier to use than geek 's editions .
Example : ADC Instruction
Let 's start with more known instruction , such as ADC .
We find something similar to the following :
|pf|0F|po|so|flds|o|proc|st|m|rl|l|mnemonic|op1 |op2 |op3|op4|iext|grp1|grp2 |tested f|modif f |def f |undef f|f values | description , notes| | | | 11 | | |r| | | | |L|ADC |r/m16/32|r16/32 | | | |gen |arith| ....... c|o..szapc|o..szapc| | | Add with Carry |
First column pf ( Prefix ) is empty .
That means the instruction 's opcode does n't contain any fixed prefix .
Next column 0 F is just allocated for 0 F prefix for multiple - byte opcodes so it is empty .
Next column po ( Primary Opcode ) holds primary opcode value itself .
Because the instruction 's opcode does n't contain any added byte , the column so ( Secondary Opcode ) is empty too .
The opcode does n't contain any specific bits so the column flds ( Opcode Fields ) is empty .
The column o ( Register / Opcode Field ) here holds " r " , which indicates that the instruction uses " full " ModR / M byte ( no opcode extension ) .
Because this instruction is supported since 8086 processor , proc column ( Introduced with Processor ) is empty .
This instruction is officially documented so st column is empty too .
Instruction ADC can work on any ring level so the column rl , Ring Level , is empty .
The column x holds " L " , which means that LOCK prefix is allowed with this instruction .
Next three columns , mnemonic , op1 and op2 show instruction 's syntax .
The destination operand of this instruction is set up using bold , what always means the operand is modified by the instruction .
The column iext ( Instruction Extension Group ) is empty because the instruction does n't belong to any instruction set extension .
Columns grp1 and grp2 classify the instruction among general arithmetic instructions .
ADC instruction is influenced by CF flag , what represents tested f column .
This instruction influences ( overwrites ) all status flags .
These can be found in next column modif f column .
All of these flags are defined ( do n't contain random values ) so the same flags are in next def f column , and undef f column must be empty .
No flag is set to a fixed value ( all modified flags depend on input operands ) so f values column is empty .
Last column description , notes contains only a general description of the instruction .
Example : Opcode Extensions
Some opcodes ( only a few ) depend on Opcode Extension Field in ModR / M byte .
Using this field , the opcode is actually extended by three bits .
In most cases , different extension of the same opcode means more or less different instruction .
An example can be opcode F6 .
We choose last three extensions of the opcode :
|pf|0F|po|so|flds|o|proc|st|m|rl|l|mnemonic|op1|op2|op3 |op4 |iext|grp1|grp2 |tested f|modif f |def f |undef f |f values | description , notes |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | F6 | | |5 | | | | | |IMUL |AX |AL |r /m8 | | |gen |arith| |o..szapc|o......c|... szap .|
| Signed Multiply |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | F6 | | |6 | | | | | |DIV |AL |AH | AX |r / m8 | |gen |arith| |o.. szapc| |o.. szapc| | Unsigned Divide |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | F6 | | |7 | | | | | |IDIV |AL |AH | AX |r / m8 | |gen |arith| |o.. szapc| |o.. szapc|
| Signed Divide |
The opcode extension can be a value from 0 through 7 .
These values are indicated in o ( Register / Opcode Field ) column .
In this example , values 5 , 6 , and 7 are chosen .
Additionally , this example shows that operands , which are not explicitly used ( AL , AH , and AX operands ) , are set up using italic .
It also shows that DIV and IDIV instructions always destroy all status flags : both modif f and undef f column contain these flags .
Example : One Opcode , More Syntaxes
Some opcodes are represented by more instructions with the same meaning , using different syntaxes .
( This does n't apply to the case when an opcode depends on Opcode Extension field in ModR / M byte .
In this case , these instructions act more or less differently ) .
Best known example are conditional jumps , for example JZ / JE , where we find something similar :
|pf|0F|po|so|flds|o|proc|st|m|rl|l|mnemonic|op1 |op2|op3|op4|iext|grp1|grp2 |tested f|modif f|def f|undef f|f values | description , notes | | | | 74 | | | | | | | | |JZ |rel8 | | | | |gen |branch | ....z...| | | | | Jump short if zero / equal ( ZF=0 ) | | | | | | | | | | | | |JE |rel8 | | | | | | | | | | | | |
Each syntax has dedicated row in mnemonic column and in columns with instruction operands .
More complex case is , for example , MOVS / MOVSW / MOVSD instruction :
|pf|0F|po|so|flds|o|proc|st|m|rl|l|mnemonic|op1 |op2 |op3|op4|iext|grp1|grp2 |tested f|modif f|def f|undef f|f values | description , notes |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | |A5 | | | | | | | | |MOVS |m16 |m16 | | | |gen |datamov|.d......| | | | | Move Data from String to String| | | | | | | | | | | | |MOVSW |m16 |m16 | | | | |string | | | | | | |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | |A5 | | | |03 + | | | | |MOVS |m16/32|m16/32 | | | |gen |datamov|.d......| | | | | Move Data from String to String| | | | | | | | | | | | |MOVSD |m32 |m32 | | | | |string | | | | | | |
Here , the opcode 's record is complicated by the fact that since 80386 processor , the syntax is extended ( thanks to 32 - bit operands ) with MOVSD mnemonic and MOVS syntax is changed .
That 's why all four syntaxes have to be split by twos .
More examples with multiple syntaxes : PUSHA / PUSHAD , SHL / SAL , or SLDT .
Example : Undocumented Instruction SETALC
All main editions contain a few undocumented instructions ( from the Intel manual point of view ) .
No that in this reference , undocumented does n't equal invalid .
All undocumented instructions mentioned by this reference work well in their shape .
It is , for example , SETALC instruction :
|pf|0F|po|so|flds|o|proc|st|m|rl|l|mnemonic|op1|op2|op3|op4|iext|grp1|grp2 |tested f|modif f |def f|undef f|f values | description , notes |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | D6 | | | |02 + | D5 | | | |undefined | | | | | | | | | Undefined and Reserved ; Does not Generate # UD|
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | D6 | | | |02 + | U6 | | | |SALC |AL | | | | |gen |datamov| .......c| | | | | Set AL If Carry | | | | | | | | | | | | |SETALC |AL | | | | | | | | | | | | |
In this case , the documented meaning goes first , as indicated in st column by " D " value .
Since this opcode 's documented meaning is not a common one , there is additional reference to the description where the opcode is documented .
The column mnemonic implies by the value " undefined " ( which is set up using italic , which always means here that it is not an original mnemonic ) that the documented meaning of this opcode is " undefined and reserved " .
This is also stated in the last column .
Below goes the undocumented meaning of the opcode - st column holds " U " value .
Each undocumented meaning should contain a reference to the description where is the opcode unofficially documented , like in this case .
More examples of undocumented instructions : INT1 / ICEBP or TEST .

Instruction Operand Codes
These codes come from official codes used in Intel manual Instruction Set Reference , N - Z for Pentium 4 processor , revision 17 .
The reason of using this particular , out - of - date revision is that the codes from this revision are most apposite ones .
In next revisions the codes changed unfortunately .
These codes were modified and completed mainly because of the possibility to code operands simultaneously for 64 - bit mode .
Ideally , it would be the best to make brand new codes , but I 'm afraid those would n't be widely acceptable .
The State column says if the code is original , added or changed .
The " Geek " part in these tables in the first column indicates codes used in HTML geek 's editions and in the source XML document as well .
The " Coder " part indicates alternative codes used in HTML coder 's editions .
These are used also within instruction reference in Intel manual .

FOUNTAIN HILLS , Arizona ( Reuters ) - Republican John McCain was deemed by his doctors on Friday to be in sufficient good health to serve as president even as they reported a long history of skin cancer , colon polyps , kidney stones and dizziness .
The Arizona senator , who turns 72 in August and would be the oldest elected first - term president , “ enjoys excellent health and displays extraordinary energy , ” said his physician Dr. John Eckstein .
“ I can find no medical reason or problems that would preclude Senator McCain from fulfilling all the duties and obligations of president of the United States , ” he said in a statement .
McCain ’s health records were made available by the Mayo Clinic of nearby Scottsdale to a small group of reporters .
The McCain campaign organized the release to try put to rest lingering questions about his health and ability to handle the rigors of the presidency .
An executive summary of McCain ’s records said he has no heart problems and was able to exercise at a high level in a treadmill stress test .
He smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for 25 years until stopping in 1980 .
The records showed that McCain has chronic shoulder pain and moderate pain of the right knee from injuries he received when as he was shot down as Navy pilot and spent 5 1/2 years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp .
Also , he has had some common health problems including benign colon polyps that were removed and kidney stones .
As recently as March 29 , McCain had a total of six polyps removed during a colonoscopy .
Major surgery on his face in 2000 removed a melanoma , a skin cancer that can be deadly .
The surgery left a noticeable scar and bulge down the left side of his face .
MELANOMAS REMOVED
One source of concern about McCain for many Americans is his age , and McCain has sought to address any questions by pursuing a vigorous campaign , but until now has not released detailed information about his health .
His likely Democratic opponent in the November election , Democratic Sen. Barack Obama , will be 47 in August .
Obama , a basketball player , says he has given up smoking but has not released his medical records .
The 1,173 pages of health records detailed McCain ’s struggle with skin cancer in which four malignant melanomas were removed in 1993 , 2000 and 2002 .
None of these represented a recurrence of any previous melanoma , a summary of the report said .
Of the most serious bout , the melanoma removed in 2000 , there has been no evidence that the cancer spread , and his skin doctor , Suzanne Connolly , noted that the period of greatest risk for a recurrence is within the first few years .

A review of the records showed he has had frequent removals of sun-exposure related growths , the most recent when “ a very early squamous cell carcinoma ” was excised by shave biopsy from his right upper shin in February .
His most recent skin exam was May 12 and he has regular checkups every three or four months .
“ Other less serious skin cancers have been removed over the years without complication .
These have been non-melanoma basal cell and squamous cell cancers , ” the report said .
McCain ’s health records showed his blood pressure and weight are healthy .
He has occasional bouts of dizziness when he stands suddenly , but tests have shown they are not a concern .
A doctor ’s report from a February 6 exam said he takes medicine to control his cholesterol , along with a baby aspirin , allergy medicine and occasionally uses the sleep - inducing drug Ambien .
A regular drinker in his young days , he now has about two alcoholic drinks a month .

In the recently published thriller , The Shell Game , Steve Alten weaves a tale of a neoconservative plot to attack Iran .
To overcome resistance , a black op group associated with a Republican administration arranges for nuclear devices to be exploded in two American cities , with planted evidence pointing to Iran .
Recent developments make one wonder if fact is following fantasy .
The Bush regime ’s propaganda against Iran is going full blast and obviously has a purpose .
The foreign press reports that the reason for Cheney ’s latest trip abroad is to cajole , threaten , and purchase support for a US attack on Iran .
The Israeli government continues to see an Iranian nuclear weapon on the horizon and to agitate for US action against Iran .
According to John McGlynn in Japan Focus ( March 22 , 2008 ) , the Bush regime is already attacking Iran with Treasury Department actions to cut off Iran ’s banking system from all international banking relationships , thereby preventing Iran from importing and exporting .
McGlynn calls the US Treasury ’s action a " US declaration of war on Iran . "
Cheney ’s trip shows that the Bush regime is undeterred by the National Intelligence Estimate ’s conclusion that Iran abandoned several years ago any nuclear weapons program that it might have had .
The International Atomic Energy Agency has never found evidence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program .
Despite all the facts and without evidence , the Bush Regime continues to assert that Iran has a nuclear weapons program that warrants an American attack on Iran .
Gen . David Petraeus , commander of US forces in Iraq and a member of the Cheney / neocon team , blamed Easter Sunday ’s bombardment of the " secure " Green Zone in Baghdad on Iran .
Petraeus says the attack is " in complete violation of promises made by President Ahmadinejad and the other most senior Iranian leaders . "
Petraeus ’s claims are part of the neocon propaganda campaign to build support for an attack on Iran .
Central Command chief Admiral William Fallon is reported to have declared that there would be no attack on Iran on his watch .
With his recent resignation effective the end of March , Fallon has been moved out of the picture .
According to news reports , Fallon derided Petraeus as a " sycophant " and told him to his face that he considered him to be " an ass - kissing little chickenshit . "
That it is Fallon who is gone and the ass - kissing little chickenshit who remains tells you all you need to know about the US military under the Cheney / Bush / neocon regime .
It is an ass - kissing , yes boss , military .
On his Web site , University of Michigan professor and Middle East expert Juan Cole has an article by Vanity Fair contributing editor Craig Unger , author of The Fall of the House of Bush .
Unger makes the point that the US attack on Iraq was not the result of " mistaken intelligence . "
It was a direct result of a plot by neoconservative conspirators , who fabricated " evidence " and spread propaganda that deceived Congress , the media , and the American people .
A conspiracy that would launch a war on the basis of forged " intelligence " and false allegations is a conspiracy that believes strongly in its agenda .
Such a conspiracy would not be content with only partial achievement of its agenda .
As we should all know by now , the neoconservative agenda is for the US to overthrow Iraq , Iran , and Syria at a minimum .
As neoconservative Norman Podhoretz has formulated the agenda , the goal is to overthrow the regimes in Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Pakistan in addition , and to clear Hezbollah out of Lebanon .
The difficulties of securing Iraq and Afghanistan have not dented the neocons ’ faith in their agenda , but time might be running out for the neocons if we assume that Bush will step down and not utter the two words – catastrophic emergency – that transform him into a dictator , and that a war weary voting public will not elect " Bomb bomb bomb Iran " McCain .
A McCain presidency would give the neocons four more years to orchestrate an attack on Iran .
Jeffery St. Clair in CounterPunch , March 24 , notes that Hillary ’s vaulting ambition could cause her to split and defeat the Democrats by playing the race card against Obama so that she can run against McCain in four years before she is too old for the game .
A conspiracy willing to launch an invasion of a country on false pretenses would not hesitate to pull off a false flag event if it would further their agenda .
The massive human , financial and diplomatic cost of the Iraq invasion is a good indication that neoconservatives are willing for America to pay any price for establishing their agenda of achieving American / Israeli hegemony over the Middle East .
We will likely never know , but a neoconservative false flag operation might lie behind what appears to have been the accidental poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko by a rare and tightly controlled radioactive isotope , Polonium - 210 .
Litvinenko , a former member of KGB counterintelligence , operated in the shadowy world of " security consultants " on a fake passport given to him by the British government .
Litvinenko left Russia when his patron , oligarch Boris Berezovsky fled to escape fraud charges .
The British government and websites financed by Berezovsky blamed Litvinenko ’s mysterious death on the Russian Federal Security Service , which allegedly sent an agent to put Polonium - 210 in Litvinenko ’s tea .
On its face , the tale is far - fetched , but it served to divert attention from the fact that Polonium - 210 had somehow got into private hands .
Where had the Polonium come from ?
No one knows , but nuclear physicist Gordon Prather noted at the time that Litvinenko had recently been to Israel and that Israel ’s nuclear reactors are not subject to international safeguards .

Vista is dead .
That 's not what Bill Gates said at a seminar on corporate philanthropy in Miami on April 4 , but it might as well have been .
What Gates actually said , according to the Reuters report , is that he expects that the next desktop version of Windows , Windows 7 , would be released " sometime in the next year or so . "
Goodbye Vista .
It has not been fun knowing you .
I predicted that Microsoft was giving up on Vista in January .
It seems I was right .
Microsoft 's own top brass had hated Vista when it first came out , why should they expect anyone else to like it ?
Vista SP1 has proven to be a painful upgrade and its performance still lags behind XP SP2 and , the still unreleased XP SP3 .
Worse still , from a Microsoft executive 's viewpoint , Windows is actually losing desktop market share to Mac OS X and Linux .
Microsoft never loses desktop market share .
But with Vista Microsoft is finally losing customers .
I think Microsoft saw the handwriting on the wall early on .
The company started playing up Windows 7 as early as July 2007 .
Now , Microsoft 's business plan is always to get its customers to upgrade to the next version .
It 's how they make their billions .
But , in this case , Vista was barely out the door .
Can Microsoft actually make a Windows 7 that can ship by 2009 that will win customers ?
Vista was infamous for its blown deadlines .
Windows 7 must not only replace the failed Vista , it has to convince Microsoft 's customers that Windows 7 will really be better than XP .
That is n't going to be easy .
I find it more than a little telling that Microsoft has given XP Home a new lease on life for UMPC ( Ultra Mobile PCs ) .
Still .
I think Microsoft has one card up its sleeve that just might keep its customers happy and make it out in 2009 : Server 2008 Workstation .
RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - Dramatic photographs of previously unfound Amazon Indians have highlighted the precariousness of the few remaining “ lost ” tribes and the dangers they face from contact with outsiders .
The bow - and - arrow wielding Indians in the pictures released on Thursday are likely the remnants of a larger tribe who were forced deeper into the forest by encroaching settlement , experts said .
Rather than being “ lost ” , they have likely had plenty of contact with other indigenous groups over the years , said Thomas Lovejoy , an Amazon expert who is president of The Heinz Center in Washington .
“ I think there is an ethical question whether you can in the end keep them from any contact and I think the answer to that is no , ” Lovejoy said .
“ The right answer is to have the kind of contact and change that the tribes themselves manage the pace of it . ”
The Brazil - Peru border area is one of the world ’s last refuges for such groups , with more than 50 uncontacted tribes thought to live there out of the estimated 100 worldwide .
They are increasingly at risk from development , especially on the Peruvian side which has been slower than Brazil to recognize protected areas for indigenous people .
Jose Carlos Meirelles , an official with Brazil ’s Indian protection agency who was on the helicopter that overflew the tribe , said they should be left alone as much as possible .
“ While we are getting arrows in the face , it ’s fine , ” he told Brazil ’s Globo newspaper .
“ The day that they are well - behaved , they are finished . ”

Contact with outsiders has historically been disastrous for Brazil ’s Indians , who now number about 350,000 compared to up to 5 million when the first Europeans arrived .
“ In 508 years of history , out of the thousands of tribes that exist none have adapted well to society in Brazil , ” said Sydney Possuelo , a former official with Brazil ’s Indian protection agency who founded its isolated tribes department .
CONCERN OVER PERU POLICY
In recent years , though , tribes like the Yanomami have succeeded in winning greater protection by becoming more politically organized and forming links with foreign conservationists .
“ It ’s not about making that decision for them .
It ’s about making time and space to make that decision themselves , ” said David Hill of the Survival International group .
More than half of the Murunahua tribe in Peru died of colds and other illness after they were contacted as a result of development for the first time in 1996 , Hill said .
Sightings of such tribes are not uncommon , occurring once every few years in the Brazil - Peru border area where there are estimated to be more than 50 out of the total global number of 100 uncontacted tribes .
In 1998 , a 200 - strong tribe was discovered by Possuelo living in huts under the forest canopy , also in Acre state near the Brazil - Peru border .

In September last year , ecologists looking for illegal loggers in Peru spotted a little - known nomadic tribe deep in the Amazon .
The sighting underscored worries among rights groups that oil and gas exploration being pushed by the Peruvian government , as well as logging , is putting tribes at risk .
Peru has no equivalent to Brazil ’s long - standing Indian affairs department , which has a policy of no contact with unknown tribes .
“ There is a lot of logging going on over on the Peruvian side , ” Hill said .
“ It ’s had all kinds of effects on the groups living there , particularly on the uncontacted groups -- it ’s led to violent conflicts and deaths . ”
In May , Peru ’s petroleum agency Perupetro said it would exclude areas where isolated tribes live from an auction of oil and gas concessions .
Perupetro had been under pressure to limit exploration activities near tribal areas , and had cast doubt on the existence of isolated groups , angering activists .
Opinion
A president 's age should concern Americans
In the 1996 presidential election , the age of Sen. Robert Dole , who at 73 was the oldest man ever to run for the office , was a substantive issue .
Although he was thought to be in good general health , his right kidney had been removed , his remaining left kidney had stones , his electrocardiograms in 1980 and 1981 were abnormal , he had pre-cancerous colonic polyps removed in 1985 , and he had undergone a radical prostatectomy for cancer in 1991 .
He had smoked for many years and had a family history of heart disease , aneurysm , emphysema and cancer .
In 2004 , which would have been the last year of a second term if he had won , he had hip replacement surgery followed by a brain hemorrhage .
After the election , Richard Brody , a political scientist at Stanford , and I , in an extensive study of the media coverage at the time ( published in 1998 in the Political Science Quarterly , ) found that allusions to Dole 's age were common , but with only occasional comments on its potential consequences .
The impact of aging and ill health on the cognitive capacities essential for an effective presidency was poorly conveyed to the American public .
Hence , more than 60 percent of respondents to surveys were not concerned about Dole 's age .
Among those for whom age was an important consideration , four times as many voters believed that Dole 's age would hamper him as president .
That group of the electorate was far more likely to vote for Clinton .
The issue of age is with us once more with Senator John McCain 's run for the office .
James Reston , the great New York Times journalist of the last century , believed that younger presidents might be more resistant to the stresses of the job .
" It is not responsible in this violent age to pick candidates for the presidency from men in their 60s , " he wrote .
How would he have reacted to a president who would be 72 at his inauguration and 80 years old in the last year of a second term ?
The question is a fair one because McCain , if elected , would be the oldest person to be inaugurated in our history .
While the Constitution endorsed age discrimination by setting 35 years as the youngest age of a president , it established no upper age limit , perhaps because life expectancy was so much shorter in 1787 than in 2008 .
When we choose presidents 65 or older , we must grapple with the possibility that they may be unable to fulfill the 208 - week - long contractual obligation implicit in their candidacy .
Dominating the illnesses that affect the elderly are heart disease , stroke , cancer , infection , hip fractures , the complications of major surgery and dementia .
Heart attacks are frequently accompanied by anxiety , depression , impaired concentration and problems with sleep .
Following a stroke , depression , anxiety and emotional lability characterize many patients .
A major sequel of surgery is confusion severe enough to impede one 's ability to think clearly .
The many drugs that the elderly use have significant side effects and may produce cognitive changes .
Dole and McCain supporters may respond , " Why worry about it when the institutional constraints guard us from irrational behavior in the White House ? "
Because the inherent risks are too great .
As Sen. McCain said in a recent interview , " I understand that my age would be a factor at any time . "
The term " cognition " refers to the interaction of mental processes that produce human thought .
Under its rubric come such faculties as concentration , attention , inventiveness , intuition , memory , foresight , abstract and logical thought .
All are applicable to meaningful decision - making , and many are essential when time is short and tensions high .
The elderly are more sluggish at processing and retrieving information from short - and long - term memory .
There is a 60 percent slowing in the rate of memory search between the ages of 20 and 50 years .
To be sure , both the health problems and the memory changes are unevenly distributed among the population .
But why take a chance ?
Why push the odds and run for the most demanding job in the western hemisphere at an age when illness abounds , memory suffers and energy flags ?
This is the period when the elderly need their afternoon nap and the absent - minded become more so .
Clearly , some great leaders have functioned well beyond the age of 70 .
But the presidency is a position that is uniquely and awesomely demanding , extending well beyond thoughtful , meditative policy decisions .
It includes many large and pressing operational components , interacting with the White House staff , the cabinet , the Congress , the media , the public , the international community and many elements within the political party system .
It is a stressful , power - packed , exhausting job , requiring stamina and energy during long days , weeks and months .
It may involve rapid responses to emergencies and crises , with decisions based on a level of accelerated information retrieval and processing that elderly presidents may lack .
Those for whom Dole 's age was important and who voted for Clinton in 1996 understood the increased likelihood of illness : in comparison to men aged 45 to 54 years , those aged 75 to 84 years are 34 times more likely to die of stroke , 17 times more likely to die of heart disease , and 12 times more likely to die of malignancy .
Nineteen percent of those between 75 and 84 years and almost half over 85 are affected with Alzheimer 's disease .
While older Americans might have thought that an older person such as Dole would best represent their interests , they were also profoundly aware of their own fragility as they moved along in their seventies .
The media have an obligation to the public .
If age affects the quality and duration of a president 's performance , as it does , the national interest is best served by making certain that the public is well informed .
Thus far , attention to McCain 's age has focused on the importance of his choice for vice president .
By this time , the media should have demanded and obtained the most recent medical data from McCain .
Dole made public his medical record in detail when he ran .
McCain did so in 1999 , but has not released the results of a recent comprehensive examination .
The voters deserve no less from him , from Clinton , and from Obama .
Certainly McCain will want his physicians to inform the voters on the status of his malignant melanomas , diagnosed on four occasions , one more serious than the others .
The Congress also has an obligation .
An upper limit on the age of candidates could be achieved by passing a Congressional resolution .
This would represent a powerful deterrent to seniors who wish to run and to politicians who would like to nominate them , while leaving the Constitution intact .
Madison and Hamilton , who understood the wisdom of a lower limit 200 years ago ( when emergency decisions were rarely required ) would appreciate the deference to the radically different , complex , interconnected world that we live in today .
An upper limit of 60 to 65 would recognize that the presidency is too demanding - physically , intellectually , psychologically , and emotionally - to place the burden on the shoulders of a senior citizen .

Today Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama was on NBC ’s Meet the Press for the full hour .
Besides talking about the gas tax , Rev. Wright , and all the other regular campaign issues , Obama was also able to talk about his plan to reduce oil consumption by 35 - 40 percent .
Host Tim Russert asked Obama how long he thought it would be before our automobiles are off gasoline and using an alternative source .
Obama answered , “ Well , you know , I , I think that if we decided right now that we were going to make the kind of investment I ’ve proposed –$ 150 billion over 10 years –then I think at the end of the decade we could have a auto industry that has significantly reduced our consumption of oil by as much as 35 , 40 percent . ”
He also pointed out that China has a higher fuel efficiency standard than the United States , “ China already has higher fuel efficiency standards than we do .
If we want to compete for those markets , then we ’re going to have to invest in technology .
The government can help , but the automakers have to make some changes . ”

Obama talked about clean burning coal , “ But if we can figure out how to sequester carbon and burn clean coal , we ’re the Saudi Arabia of coal , and I do n’t think that we can dismiss out of hand the use of coal as part of our energy mix .
What we are going to have to understand , though , is , is that global warming is real , it is serious and that whatever options we come up with , if they are not addressing the fact that the planet is getting warmer , then we are failing not just this generation , but future generations . ”
He mentioned nuclear power , but said that we need to figure out how to safely store the material , and wondered if we can deal with the expense of building nuclear power plants .
Instead of giving us a ridiculous option like a gas tax holiday , or vaguely talking about creating jobs through alternative fuels , Obama understands that the key to lowering the price of oil is reducing consumption .
The man has a real plan , and one of the great things about hour long candidate appearances on programs like Meet the Press , which is the gold standard of Sunday talk , is that we get hear some of these ideas .

news
Incidentally , the " old story , not news " label was actually perfected by Karl Rove .
Specifically , Rove taught people to " slime " the character of the person accusing the White House of wrongdoing , or otherwise to misdirect the debate .
If that that was not possible , or was not working , he advocated labeling any harmful facts as " old news " , and thus not worth paying any attention to .
Every time an important fact undermining the official story about 9/11 is raised , defenders of the government 's version try to label it as an " story " which is " not " .
Are they right ?

The Bay Area celebrated May Day in traditional fashion Thursday - with an array of protests around the region : for an end to the war in Iraq , against education budget cuts and in favor of legalization for undocumented immigrants .
Dockworkers with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union walked off the job at ports up and down the West Coast , including Oakland and San Francisco , calling for an end to the war .
Union officials estimated the number of workers at 25,000 while maritime officials placed the number closer to 10,000 .
Anti-war protesters , joining dockworkers and other labor leaders , marched down the Embarcadero from Fisherman 's Wharf to Justin Herman Plaza , where a rally drew several hundred protesters and onlookers .
Students at San Francisco State University , UC Berkeley and other college campuses staged walkouts and teach - ins over the state 's proposed cuts to education spending .
By late afternoon , the attention shifted toward immigrant rights - with thousands of marchers taking to the streets in San Francisco and Oakland .
Protesters said they want laws making it easier to work , obtain driver 's licenses and keep families united , without constant fear of deportation .
This year 's marches - in major cities across the United States - did not rival the huge immigrant rights marches during the spring of 2006 , in which several million protesters took to the streets across the country .
But immigrant rights advocates are continuing the drumbeat , urging Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would provide a path to legal status , and ultimately citizenship , for the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States .
Groups that favor more restrictive immigration policies denounced Thursday 's marches .
" The U.S. should use Mexico 's legal immigration policy as a model , which would bar burdensome immigrants and would not allow the chain migration of extended families , so that we can first improve life for those who are already here legally , U.S. and foreign - born , " said Yeh Ling Ling , director of the Oakland - based Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America .
The day of protests began at about dawn at the Port of Oakland , where dozens of anti-war protesters rallied outside the port 's rail terminal .
They waved signs and urged truckers and other port workers to join the longshore workers in staying off the job , but not try to block their access .
" We 're here to support the longshore union workers , " said Toby Blome of El Cerrito who was carrying a large peace symbol fashioned from a hula hoop and covered in artificial flowers .
" This is a very courageous effort they 're doing . "
Operations in Oakland and other West Coast ports ground to a halt Thursday after ILWU workers stayed off the job , said Steve Getzug , spokesman for the Pacific Maritime Association , which represents companies that move cargo through the ports .
" There is no activity , " he said .
" The ILWU struck West Coast ports and brought cargo operations to a virtual standstill . "
In San Francisco , marchers were urged on by a spirited brass band and led by the ILWU drill team , wearing taps on their shoes and carrying grappling hooks in their hands .
At Justin Herman Plaza , Clarence Thomas , an ILWU spokesman , praised the protesters for walking off the job and called on others to join them .
" Could you imagine if this were being duplicated in more places in all the major sectors of the economy ? " he said .
" It would send a message that we want this war to end .
It 's killing our children and diverting resources from domestic needs . "
At San Francisco State University , hundreds of students walked out of classes at noon to protest fee hikes - then ended up blocking traffic on busy 19th Avenue in front of the campus for about half an hour , said campus spokeswoman Ellen Griffin .
The march from Dolores Park to the Civic Center drew an energetic and youthful crowd of hundreds of people , who walked to chanting and drumming .
Two dozen teenagers led the march , carrying a banner that depicted flags of all the nations of the Americas - from Canada to Chile .
Marchers were accompanied by a mixture of bouncy Mexican corridos and sing - song chants in English , including " We are people , we are not illegal . "
Across the bay , hundreds of immigrants and supporters flooded the Fruitvale BART station for a march to Oakland City Hall for a rally .
The rally featured Aztec dancers , singers and speeches demanding better rights for immigrants .
" All we want to do is work and put food on the table , " said Jamilent Canaca , a mother of two from Hayward who works in construction , through a translator .
" But it 's very difficult to find employment and support your family .
We still have to struggle , like we 're still in a Third World country . "
IN BUSINESS
-- Dockworkers on the West Coast brought port operations to a halt for eight hours in a war protest on May Day .

Amusement parks are n't all fun and games .
Some are strange , some are boring .
But those are exactly the ones we 've been hunting for .
1. The Ocean Dome
Located in Miyazaki , Japan , Ocean Dome is the world 's largest indoor water park .
It features a massive ( 460x278 feet ) heated fresh - water " ocean "  bedded by 600 tons of polished marble chips and filled with 13,500 tons of water , all surrounded by a three - story promenade of shops .
The Dome also has its own rainforest and a volcano that erupts hourly .
The whole park is covered by a retractable roof that lets the sun shine in on Japanese tanners .
Sounds great , right ?
A place that lets Japanese urbanites get a taste of the great outdoors .
Not quite .
The Ocean Dome is less than 1000 feet from a real beach .
2. Grutas Park
" Josef Stalin "  and " amusement "  are n't two words you normally associate with each other ; but amusing or not , Lithuania 's Grutas Park recreates life under the reign of the Man of Steel .
Grutas , a short drive south of the Lithuanian capital , features a zoo and a playground and a recreated gulag with guard towers and an electrified fence ( you know , the same kind that Stalin imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians in back in the day ) .
The real draw , though , is the 1.2 - mile - long sculpture exposition , which is home to 82 Communist - era sculptures that were dismantled following the restoration of Lithuanian independence .
Most of the sculptures were tossed into storehouses , people 's yards and anywhere else there was room .
Poor handling and storage damaged some of them , while others fell prey to scrap metal pickers .
In 1998 , Viliumas Malinauskas , a mushroom tycoon and former heavyweight wrestler , answered an open call from the Ministry of Culture to create a space that would preserve and display the statues .
Municipalities and private citizens , desperate to dump the hunks of metal and the memories of Stalin on someone else , sent Malinauskas statues en masse .
Where the petting zoo came into things , I have no idea .
3. The Nintendo Amusement Park
Why would the website for a video game theme park proclaim that there 's " nothing digital " ¦nothing projected " ¦nothing virtual "  about it ?
That sounds about as much fun as feeding the ducks at the gulag .
What gives ?
Well , the Nintendo Amusement Park has little to do with the Nintendo Corporation , less to do with video games , and is n't even really a park .
It 's a single " user - controlled interactive ride "  ( read : obstacle course ) that " players "  navigate using a mechanically powered harness to give them a sense of being inside a video game .
If you ever wondered what a real - world Mario would look like , grab a chubby , mustachioed friend and watch as he bounces from platform to platform while strapped to a crane .
The ride is only a prototype right now , and its creators , who are just " borrowing "  the Nintendo name and aesthetic , are still seeking venture capital and a contact at either Nintendo or Disney to develop a partnership .
4. BonBon-Land
BonBon - Land is an amusement park in Denmark based on a line of Danish candy .
It 's sort of like Pennsylvania 's Hershey Park , except most of the rides involve toilet humor and the giant anthropomorphic candy people have been replaced by topless anthropomorphic hippos .
A day at BonBon - Land treats candy - loving Danes to rides like The Crazy Turtle , The Horse Dropping and Hundeprutterutchebane .
That last one , which loosely translates to " Dog Fart Switchback , " is a roller coaster that takes riders on an exciting journey around giant mounds of dog poo , while speakers around the track blare fart sounds the whole while .

5. Diggerland
Dog poo not your thing , but you still want to get down and dirty ?
Then head on down to one of four Diggerland locations in jolly ol ' England , where you can " ride in , and drive , different types of construction machinery , including Dumper Trucks , Mini Diggers and Giant Diggers . "
When they 're done playing with heavy machinery , park visitors can take in a show put on by the Dancing Diggers , a stunt team that performs inside a front - end loader .

6. Suoi Tien Park
Siddhartha Gautama , the historical Buddha , was a prince that gave up his material possessions , became an ascetic and sought Enlightenment through meditation .
But just look at those tubby Buddha statues ; there 's something about the guy that screams " snow cones and water slides . " 
Suoi Tien Park is a Buddhist - themed amusement park in Vietnam that injects a little fun into the daily grind of unenlightened life .
There are thrills like race cars , water slides and roller coasters .
There are chills like the " bat cave with innumerable bats "  and an air bike suspended over a crocodile farm ( " which cause fearful feeling for tourist "  ) .
And then there 's the serious side of the park , a Pirates of the Caribbean - style journey through 12 animatronics Hells .

7. Dracula Land
We 're cheating a little on this one , since it does n't actually exist , and probably wo n't for some time .
What an idea , though : A Disney - style theme park revolving around the life and times of Vlad the Impaler , Romanian folk hero and inspiration for Count Dracula .
A few years ago , the Romanians drew up plans for Dracula Land and Tourism Minister Agathon Dan made big promises like underground tunnels , live bats , thousands of gallons of fake blood , millions of dollars a year in revenue and 3,000 jobs for a nearby village .
But alas , foreign investors were n't impressed the Romanians could n't finance the park by themselves .
Romania has since dropped plans to build the massive park in Transylvania .
Funding was one issue , but the stake in its heart was the risk of environmental damage .
The proposed site of the park is an old - growth forest that 's home to 400 - year - old oak trees .
But Dracula Land may rise from the grave yet .
Recently , there 's been talk of building closer to Bucharest , or near the site of Vlad 's real castle ( pictured ) .
8. Dickens World
Brutal dictatorships .
The torments of Hell .
Dog poop .
Yessir , we 've covered some pretty un-amusing stuff in this list .
But what could be further from fun than the literary work of Mr. Charles Dickens ?
If you want to experience poverty in 19th century London for yourself but do n't have a time machine , then Dickens World is for you .
It features the Great Expectations Boat Ride , the Haunted House of Ebenezer Scrooge and a Victorian School Room .
Fun !

A New York City man is suing JetBlue Airways Corp. for more than $ 2 million because he says a pilot made him give up his seat to a flight attendant and sit on the toilet for more than three hours on a flight from California .
Gokhan Mutlu , of Inwood section , says in court papers the pilot told him to " go ' hang out ' in the bathroom " about 90 minutes into the to New York flight because the flight attendant complained that the " jump seat " she was assigned was uncomfortable , the lawsuit said .
Mutlu was traveling on a a " buddy pass , " a standby travel voucher that JetBlue employees give to friends , from New York to San Diego on Feb. 16 , and returned to New York on Feb. 23 , the lawsuit said .
Initially , Mutlu was told a flight attendant had taken the last seat on the plane , but then he was advised she would sit in the employee " jump seat , " meaning he could have the last seat , the lawsuit said .
The pilot told him 1 hours into the five - hour flight that he would have to relinquish the seat to the flight attendant , court papers say .
But the pilot said that Mutlu could not sit in the jump seat because only JetBlue employees were permitted to sit there , the lawsuit said .
When Mutlu expressed reluctance to go sit in the bathroom , the pilot , who was not named in the lawsuit , told him that " he was the pilot , that this was his plane , under his command that ( Mutlu ) should be grateful for being on board , " the lawsuit said .
When the aircraft hit turbulence and passengers were directed to return to their seats , but " the plaintiff had no seat to return to , sitting on a toilet stool with no seat belts , " court papers say .
Some time later , a male flight attendant knocked on the restroom door and told Mutlu he could return to his original seat , court papers say .
Mutlu 's lawsuit , filed Friday in Manhattan 's state Supreme Court , says JetBlue negligently endangered him by not providing him with a seat with a safety belt or harness , in violation of federal law .
A JetBlue spokesman declined comment on the lawsuit Monday .

BBC News entertainment reporter
Cumming now divides his time between the UK and US Actor Alan Cumming has said the media 's attitude towards homosexuality is scaring off gay actors from coming out .
The 43 - year - old X - Men 2 star said actors were afraid because the press portrayed being gay as controversial .
" I do n't think the people that go see films care that much - the media make it more of a deal and it's made into controversy , " he told the BBC .
Cumming added : " There is a lot of homophobia in the world - but in Hollywood definitely . "
Pigeonholed Actors like Stephen Fry and Rupert Everett recently complained they feel pigeonholed since coming out .
But Cumming , who " married " his partner Grant Shaffer in a civil ceremony last year , does not think he has been .
" Some of them do , but lots of straight actors get pigeonholed in various roles , " he said .
Cumming will soon be seen in Tin Man , a modern take on The Wizard of Oz " I 'm quite outspoken in the media about what I perceive as a civil rights struggle that gay people in America are still going through .
" But I do n't think that I only play gay characters , or I would n't be as convincing if I had a wife or a girlfriend in a movie . "
Derek Munn , director of public affairs for Stonewall which promotes equality and justice for gay people , said : " Stonewall has long been concerned about the representation of lesbian and gay people , both in the film industry and the media in general .
" The pitifully low number of openly lesbian or gay actors suggests that there is a problem .
The film industry needs to think about why it is that gay actors choose not to come out . '
Cumming , who was born in Perthshire , Scotland , now divides his time between the UK and the US .
In addition to his theatre work , he has starred in Hollywood films including GoldenEye , Spy Kids and the 2000 remake of Get Carter .
He will soon be seen in Tin Man , a modern re-working of The Wizard of Oz , to be shown on the Sci -Fi Channel in the UK this month .
A full interview with Alan Cumming will appear on the BBC News website next week

Johnny
Whitt , a soft - spoken skateboarder , grinned just thinking about his summertime ritual of going to the pool with his friend , Rowan O'Halloran , to hang out and cool off .
But when informed that Georgia may be closing swimming pools at the height of " the sticky season , " Johnny 's happy face soured .
" That 's a bad idea , " he says .
" It 's too hot around here in the summer to go without the pool . "
Bad idea or not , the possibility of widespread pool closings this summer shows that the southeast 's drought – a dry spell of historic note making worldwide headlines – is disrupting everything from kids ' comfort to some of the region 's key industries .
Moreover , how the South responds to the improbably dry weather may affect the broader US economy , since the region 's booming metro areas and job growth have so far fended off a national recession .
" The coincidence of having [ potential ] recession plus drought is a tough one for the economy , " says Jeff Humphreys , an economist at the University of Georgia in Athens .
" It 's coming on top of the housing recession and the oil price shock , making our economy more vulnerable than would otherwise be the case .
I do n't think the drought alone is able to produce a recession , but it adds to negative forces that are already out there . "
And on it drags , as recent rains have failed to refresh exhausted reservoirs .
As an unusual bank of fronts in the West channeled the South 's usual rains into deluges in Texas and the Midwest , the drought interfered with rural baptisms and put landscapers out of work , with losses in that industry totaling nearly $ 1 billion .
A pool ban alone would wreck Georgia 's $ 150 million pool - maintenance industry , experts say .
" The economic impact of long - term water shortages could be profound because water is so central to daily living , power generation , and manufacturing , " noted a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta .
Some nuclear power plants in the Southeast , which require huge amounts of water to operate , could be forced to throttle back or temporarily shut down later this year because drought is drying up the rivers and lakes used to cool the reactors , the Associated Press reported last month .
Such shutdowns probably would n't cause blackouts , utility officials say .
But they could lead to shockingly higher electric bills for millions of Southerners , because the region 's utilities could be forced to buy expensive replacement power from other energy companies .
As governors prayed for rain , North Carolina horse breeders began shipping hay in from Canada , because hay prices in the United States have doubled , even tripled in some places .
From soybean farms facing irrigation bans to car - wash joints hawking " guiltless " waterless washes , the drought is on everybody 's mind .
" The country was founded on the theme of superabundance , " says Andy Harper , an environmental historian at the University of Mississippi in Oxford .
" We have n't changed our approaches and consumption patterns ... [ so ] it 's time to pay the price of that willful ignorance . "
So far , Southerners are adjusting in small , sometimes meaningful , ways to weeks of little to no rain .
In the silver lining department , Chris , a Decatur skateboarder , points out that empty pools make excellent skateboarding ramps .
Cities and towns are adjusting , too , as the drought begins to have political implications .
One Atlanta suburb recently enacted a moratorium on rezoning land for commercial or residential use to try to lessen its impact on the state 's two main reservoirs , Lakes Lanier and Allatoona .
In Raleigh , N.C. , some politicians say a water impact fee should be charged to discourage runaway development – which many blame , along with the weather , for the drought .
Such ideas could undermine the South 's economic vitality , says Philip Isley ( R ) , a Raleigh city councilor .
He points to a recent Brookings Institution report that calls fast - growing metro areas , especially in the Sunbelt , the last remaining stallions of the US economy .
" I 'm concerned that these so - called water policies are really stalking horses for growth moratoriums , " says Mr. Isley .
Other critics claim that measures such as pool bans could work against conservation efforts by alienating residents at a time when their cooperation is needed most .
" You have to make a rational decision about what is a good policy and what is a bad policy , " says Georgia state Rep. Chip Rogers ( R ) , who has introduced a bill that would stop the state from closing the pools .
" To take such a drastic measure and cancel every swim team and prevent every parent from having a weekend at the pool with the kids is a little too much . "
Water issues are likely to dog the Southeast well into the future , says Robin Craig , an environmental law professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee .
" A lot of communities are telling themselves that this will all go away when the drought goes away , but I do n't think it will , " says Professor Craig .
" Until you get the message across at a gut level that this is n't a resource you can take for granted ... yeah , changes are going to be hard politically . "

Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has proposed the Federal Reserve be given broad powers to regulate the financial industry .
He could not have nominated a more incompetent body .
The Coast Guard would do a better job .
Financial upheaval owes homage to derivatives that shrouded the massive growth in debt and leverage .
This murky world inflated the incentives of those who ran the machinery over the cliff � bankers , mortgage brokers , law firms , appraisers , rating agencies , politicians , and on it goes .
This is well known .
Despite protestations , the parties knew they were behaving either recklessly or criminally at the time .
The Federal Reserve encouraged them .
With a straight face , Hank Paulson proposes that the Fed quash future imbroglios .
Yet the terracotta soldiers of Xian would bring more initiative to the assignment .
In September 1998 , the Federal Reserve didn�t have the slightest idea of how the banking system functioned ; it hadn�t the slightest idea of the banks � exposure to hedge funds ; nor had it the slightest idea of the leverage within the financial system .
Maybe these deficiencies are excusable , although the Federal Reserve was responsible for regulating bank holding companies ( the holding companies being where much of the risk was housed ) .
It is unpardonable in the aftermath , having learned of its own deficiencies , the Federal Reserve made no effort to improve its oversight or to warn of the dangers it had recently discovered .
Instead , the Fed encouraged devious practices .
In the first three weeks of September 1998 , Long - Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) , a Greenwich , Conn. , hedge fund , lost half a billion dollars per week and everyone knew it .
Except , possibly , Alan Greenspan .
In mid-September , the Federal Reserve chairman told the House Banking Committee that " Hedge funds [ are ] strongly regulated by those who lend the money . "
On Sept. 21 , LTCM lost $ 550 million .
In a virtuoso rejection of every financial institution�s model , all security prices went down .
This is normal .
In a panic , everyone sells .
The Fed�s lackluster oversight was partly to blame .
On May 2 , 1998 , Alan Greenspan gave a speech in which he emphasized the advantages of " private market regulation . "
Greenspan explained , " Rapidly changing technology has begun to render obsolete much of the bank examination regime established in earlier decades .
Bank regulators are perforce now being pressed to depend increasingly on ever more complex and sophisticated private market regulation �
One of the key lessons from U.S. banking history [ is ] that counterparty supervision is still the first line of regulatory defense . "
He also noted the Federal Reserve�s decision to supervise " risk management procedures , rather than actual portfolios . "
The Fed now evaluated how banks monitored their own risks ( e.g. , their modeling techniques , the process used to monitor counterparties ) in lieu of examining specific securities .
The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) held a conference call on Sept. 29 , 1998 .
The staff and Federal Reserve governors briefed Greenspan on Long - Term Capital Management�s counterparties � the banks that lent to LTCM .
He was told that none of the banks , with the exception of Bankers Trust , had an up - to - date balance sheet for LTCM .
Even this was " only a small piece of [ Bankers� ] whole action because so much of the latter is off balance sheet . "
When assets are off balance sheet , the bank�s motivation to " strongly regulate " is diminished .
The Federal Reserve chairman was at a loss : " The question is why it happened in the first place .
Is it just that the lenders were dazzled by the people at LTCM and did not take a close look ? "
Vice Chairman William McDonough replied there " was in place a credit system that made a great deal of sense . "
In the next sentence � which simply cannot have been an explanation of this sensible system � McDonough told the FOMC : " For at least some of the lenders , there was no initial margin requirement . "
McDonough went on to suggest the Federal Reserve might have taken more initiative : " We do not regulate the firm .
But given the number of institutions they dealt with around the world , was there a way that should have enabled us to be more aware of their overall position ?
One is inclined to say , � You bet . �
But exactly how we could have done that I am not so sure . "
This was not the time for the FOMC to design a regulatory apparatus , but the Greenspan Fed never did attempt to fill this gap .
In retirement , Greenspan reminds his audiences that the Fed does not regulate hedge funds .
True , but the Fed could have worked backward from the foundation that McDonough had suggested .
( The SEC is responsible for monitoring broker - dealers .
It , too , has failed miserably . )
The need for adult supervision of banks was obvious when a staffer commented on the conference call , " It is something of a signature for [ LTCM ] to insist that if a counterparty wanted to deal with them , there would be no initial margin .
Not many other firms have gotten away with that . "
For this reason alone , the Fed should have geared up its watchdogs to better monitor the suicidal banking system it regulated .
Another staff member enlightened the FOMC with a frightful prospect : " The counterparties �get comfortable with zero percent margin .
But from the [ financial ] system�s point of view , zero initial margin permits an essentially unlimited amount of leverage .
There is no constraint other than the exhaustion on the part of the counterparties . "
Greenspan and Bernanke fiddled with their slide rules as financial derivatives grew to 10 times the world�s GDP .
In 2007 , Bernanke should have known that banks , in a desperate attempt keep dancing , were borrowing at five percent to lend at four percent .
Greenspan was vexed : " It is one thing for one bank to have failed to appreciate what was happening to [ LTCM ] , but this list of [ banks without knowledge of LTCM�s positions ] is just mind - boggling . "
So boggled was the man that the Greenspan ( and Bernanke )
Fed allowed the banks to lever as never before and write $ 400 trillion worth of derivatives between then and 2008 � without so much as a dollar bill of reserves :
Nor a peep that maybe these off - balance - sheet liabilities might bear closer attention .
A staff member described what he had learned on his field trip to LTCM .
On Aug. 31 , the hedge fund had a $ 125 billion balance sheet .
It also had $ 1.4 trillion of off - balance - sheet assets .
On Sept. 21 , when it appears ( from the transcript ) the Fed first saw LTCM�s balance sheet , its leverage was 55 - to - 1 and the " off - balance - sheet leverage was 100 - to - 1 or 200 - to - 1 � I don�t know how to calculate it . "
He wasn�t alone .
Greenspan�s " first line of regulatory defense " didn�t know if LTCM was trading interest rate swaps or stolen cars .
The models of LTCM�s " counterparty supervision " were so " complex and sophisticated " that the hedge fund�s portfolio had been translated into a Greek salad � gammas , thetas , and epsilons .
For practical purposes , LTCM had no capital by Sept. 29 .
It was not able to meet margin calls .
The hedge fund had not been required to post margin , but was required to post collateral worth 100 percent of the assets it borrowed .
Even this looked amateurish .
Greenspan , a former director of J.P. Morgan , shared his view : " If I am a bank lender and I lend $ 200 million to a hedge find , ordinarily , I would be overcollateralized .
I would hold more than $ 200 billion in , say , U.S. Treasury bills . "
Greenspan asked if the collateral was U.S. Treasuries .
A staffer replied : " U.S. Treasuries , Danish government bonds , BBB credits � you name it . "
Beanie Babies were next on the list .
The value of LTCM�s collateral was falling .
The balance sheets of the banks LTCM traded with were sinking .
A staffer explained the risk : " I�m going to say this in plain English .
If markets keep moving away from [ LTCM ] in the wrong direction , their future exposure could be large and they might not have the collateral at that point in time to cover the exposure . "
McDonough had described the house of cards earlier : " The firm�s position in a variety of instruments was very large .
What my contacts were talking about was the effect that the failure of the firm would have on world markets if all these positions had to be dumped on the markets .
People who thought they had an offsetting position with [ LTCM ] would suddenly find that they did not have one .
They would suddenly find themselves with big open positions � "
Globalization might end in a financial meltdown .
A Fed staffer thought the banks " were saying the right things in terms of the kinds of risk management processes they had in place " but " the question is how effectively the banks were actually implementing them � "
The Fed staff had not taken the initiative to check .
Greenspan was told the Federal Reserve had not examined the banks since December 1997 .
In Greenspan�s remaining decade at the helm , his bureaucrats produced masterful studies on counterparty risk , but permitted the banks � risk models to optimize executive bonus compensation .
This is interesting , but not of great utility in 2008 .
The 1998 Fed weaknesses are important because the molehill grew into a mountain .
Greenspan and Bernanke chaired the most egregious administrative failure in financial history .
Paulson�s proposal is on a par with Caligula�s decision to name his horse consul .
In March 1999 , Greenspan gave a speech on derivatives .
He might have wandered onto the podium from Mars .
Derivatives " are an increasingly important vehicle for unbundling risk . "
He doused the post - LTCM movement toward a better form of regulation : " Some may now argue that the periodic emergence of financial panics implies a need to abandon models - based approaches to regulatory capital and to return to traditional approaches based on regulatory risk schemes .
In my view , this would be a major mistake . "
The regulators � risk models " are much less accurate than banks � risk measurement models . "
The Federal Reserve is not the institution to lead the much - needed bank regulation .
The nominal value of derivative contracts held by U.S. commercial banks ( those over which the Fed has direct regulatory authority ) leapt from $ 33 trillion at the end of 1998 to $ 101 trillion at the end of 2005 , about the time Greenspan left office .
We mustn�t ignore Greenspan�s successor :
By the second quarter of 2007 , 18 months later , these banks held $ 153 trillion in derivatives .
The collapsing financial system is in the early stage of unwinding .
Ben Bernanke has had time as Fed chairman to do something � anything � to slow the production of bad debt .
Instead , the rate of financial claims in the economy accelerated .
The virtues of derivatives ( their ability to diversify risk away from the banking system ) received full approval from Greenspan and , more to the point , from his audiences .
Bernanke is considered a monetary genius .
Will we ever learn ?
Someday , we might ridicule , rather than praise , the Fed .
On that day , it should be disbanded .

Journalist released from Guantánamo details abuse
By Naomi Spencer
5 May 2008
After six years of imprisonment without charge , a well - known cameraman for Al Jazeera news was released May 1 by the US military .
The reporter , Sami al - Hajj , was captured in 2001 while covering the US invasion of Afghanistan and subjected to the torture and abuse that is routine at US military - run prison camps .
Without prior announcement , the military returned al - Hajj to his home country of Sudan with two other prisoners who had also been held for years at the US - run Guantánamo Bay prison .
Al - Hajj was gaunt and too weak to stand or speak as soldiers carried him off the C - 17 cargo plane and placed him , still shackled , on a stretcher .
He was transported immediately to a hospital in Khartoum .
His brother told reporters he did not immediately recognize al - Hajj , who had been seized as a healthy 32 - year - old and now resembled a man in his eighties .
Al - Hajj spent the last 16 months of his imprisonment as a hunger striker .
Twice a day , soldiers strapped him into a restraint chair and shoved a feeding tube through his nose to his stomach .
Human rights lawyers for al - Hajj — a survivor of throat cancer — have said that the force - feedings scraped his throat raw .
Over the course of 480 days , the journalist lost 40 pounds .
While imprisoned , he was denied medical care for his cancer , kidney infections , and injuries .
He was also subjected to beatings , extreme temperature exposures , sexual assault , threats with military dogs , and other human rights violations .
Al - Hajj also reported that guards defaced the Koran and flushed the book down the toilet .
His US captors did not publicly acknowledge that al - Hajj was among the prisoners at Guantánamo until it was revealed in documents obtained in April 2006 through a Freedom of Information Act request .
Speaking to Al Jazeera television from his hospital bed in Khartoum on Friday , al - Hajj stated : “ I ’m very happy to be in Sudan , but I ’m very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in Guantánamo .
Conditions in Guantánamo are very , very bad , and they get worse by the day .
“ Our human condition , our human dignity was violated , and the American administration went beyond all human values , all moral values , all religious values .
In Guantánamo ...rats are treated with more humanity .
But we have people from more than 50 countries that are completely deprived of all rights and privileges , and they will not give them the rights that they give to animals .
“ For more than seven years , I did not get a chance to be brought before a civil court .
To defend their just case and to get the freedom that we ’re deprived of , they ignored every kind of law , every kind of religion .
But thank God .
I was lucky , because God allowed that I be released .
“ Although I ’m happy , there is part of me that is not , because my brothers remain behind , and they are in the hands of people that claim to be champions of peace and protectors of rights and freedoms .
“ But the true , just peace does not come through military force , or threats to use smart or stupid bombs , or to threaten with economic sanctions .
Justice comes from lifting oppression and guaranteeing rights and freedoms and respecting the will of the people and not to interfere with a country ’s internal politics . ”
In a second statement that was reported by Reuters later on Friday , al - Hajj said , “ Security and human rights are inseparable issues — you cannot have one without the other .
Human rights are not only for times of peace — you need to hold onto them always , even during difficult times and times of war . ”
“ My last message to the US administration , ” he concluded , “ is that torture will not stop terrorism — torture is terrorism . ”
Al - Hajj was detained by Pakistani forces on December 15 , 2001 , at a border crossing while heading , along with another Al Jazeera reporter , into Afghanistan .
He was held in Pakistani custody for three weeks , then handed over to US forces stationed at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan , a makeshift prison camp that was notorious for torture .
He was held for 16 days at the base , which he told the press freedom group Committee to Protect Journalists were “ the longest days of my life . ”
He was severely beaten by soldiers , who accused him of recording videos of Osama bin Laden .
Al - Hajj was then shifted to another prison facility at Kandahar ; in June 2002 , he was delivered , bound and gagged , to Guantánamo .
Although US officials have given multiple rationales for his detention , al - Hajj told reporters that a primary purpose was “ to abort free media reporting ” in the Middle East .
He said that in the hundreds of interrogations to which he was subjected , his captors repeatedly tried to get him to say there was a link between Al Jazeera and Al Qaeda .
Al Jazeera news , by far the most popular media outlet in the Middle East , has been particularly targeted by the US for its critical reporting of the invasions .
Its offices and reporters have come under fire of US military multiple times since the invasion of Afghanistan , including bombings of the media outlet ’s offices in Kabul in 2001 and Baghdad in 2003 , to which al - Hajj made specific reference .
The US administration absurdly claimed both attacks were mistakes .
However , internal memos emerging in 2006 from the Tony Blair government in Britain indicated that top British and US officials — including US President George W. Bush — advocated the attacks and wanted Al Jazeera ’s Qatar headquarters bombed as well .
The US military has attempted to quash and intimidate coverage of the war that is outside of its control .
On the same day that American forces bombed Al Jazeera ’s Baghdad office , troops also opened fire on a hotel housing more than 100 “ non- embedded ” press correspondents .
Since the initiation of the so - called “ war on terror , ” dozens of independent journalists have come under US fire and been killed , wounded , or detained .
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists , since 2001 , at least 10 other journalists have been detained by the US military for long periods without charge , then eventually released .
While the news of al - Hajj ’s release received considerable coverage in the international press , US reports were notably muted .
Most of the major papers carried short items or republished wire reports from Reuters or the Associated Press .
On May 2 , ABC
News opted to run a counter - report featuring three unidentified “ Pentagon officials , ” who claimed al - Hajj had boarded the plane at Guantánamo “ healthy and good - natured ” and portrayed his weakened state upon disembarking in Sudan as his “ latest effort to influence public opinion . ”
In a nauseating display of irony , the officials , whom ABC News did not bother to identify by name , rank , or position , called al - Hajj “ a manipulator and a propagandist . ”
His credibility was questionable , the officials said , because there was “ no information to substantiate his allegations that he was mistreated at Guantánamo . ”
Indeed , the US military and the Bush administration are responsible for the fact that there is little publicly available documentation of al - Hajj ’s treatment , for reasons that are obvious by the physical condition in which the former detainee arrived .
For years , the military did not even admit to his imprisonment , let alone allow human rights monitors regular access to him .
It is beyond question that the man was abused .
In addition to bearing scars and the devastating physical effects of his hunger strikes upon his return , al - Hajj exhibited signs of paranoia from his abuse .
And in a clear indication that al - Hajj was not well treated even after his release from Guantánamo , other detainees that were aboard the flight last week told the press that they had all been handcuffed , chained and blindfolded the entire time .
Continuing to insinuate al - Hajj ’s association with militant or terrorist activity , one of the Pentagon plants told ABC , “ I expect he ’ll likely be in the news for some time to continue claiming all sorts of wild things .
It ’s the advantage they have in this fight .
It ’s a war of ideas , and they can claim any wild number of things happened to them and they ’ll capitalize on it .
It puts the pressure on us to disprove them . ”
Similarly , another unnamed Pentagon official told Reuters that al - Hajj was “ not being released , ” but rather “ being transferred to the Sudanese government . ”
Sudanese officials took pains to make it clear that al - Hajj was not in custody and did not face any charges .
For those Ron Paul supporters who are feeling weary , we need not be discouraged .
There is nothing to feel sorry about and all our hard work has not been in vain .
In many ways this revolution for change has only just begun .
Ron Paul has further passed on the baton to us and what we do with it will ultimately shape our future .
We have not been abandoned and he will continue to fight for the Constitution and freedom like he has for the last 30 years .
With insurmountable odds we have put a dent in the establishments armor and have changed the rules and the political landscape forever .
We are are not alone and our voices will be heard .
The power is in the people and together there is no limit to what we can accomplish .
This movement was always more than about Ron Paul - it is about getting proactive and taking action on our own at a grassroots level .
We have him to thank for all the ideas and issues he has injected into the campaign that would have never otherwise seen the light of day .
This has been a learning curve and along the way some mistakes have been made , but this will only help us in the long run and make us stronger .
Real everlasting change will not come easy , but it is attainable .
This is not the end but the beginning , the first stages of this peaceful revolution .
This whole election season , I have likened Ron Paul 's campaign to the Star Wars movie , A New Hope , and in particular a certain scene .
During the lightsaber duel on the Death Star , Obi-Wan Kenobi says to Darth Vader , “ You ca n't win Darth .
If you strike me down , I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine . ”
We have not been defeated as this movement will go forward and continue to grow .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Residential real estate has posted another record decline .
The S&P Case / Shiller Home Price index of 20 key markets , released Tuesday , shows that home prices plunged 10.7 % in the 12 months ending January .
That marks their lowest level since the index launched in 2000 .
Of those 20 metro areas , 16 reported record annual declines .
Ten of those cities posted double digit declines through the 12 months that ended in January .
The survey 's 10 - city index fell 11.4 % year - over - year , its steepest decline since its inception in 1987 .
A national decline .
While regional declines in home prices are not uncommon , the current decline is the " first national decline we 've had , " said Robert Shiller , Yale professor of economics and co-founder of the index .
" In a historical context we 're down substantially , down more than at any other time that we 've been keeping track , " he added .
Las Vegas and Miami reported the weakest markets in January , with each city posting an annual decline of 19.3 % .
Phoenix was the second worst with a decline of 18.2 % .
Washington and Minneapolis also registered double digit declines in January .
Only one city , Charlotte N.C. , posted a modest price increase of 1.8 % .
" Unfortunately it does not look like early 2008 is marking any turnaround in the housing market , " says David M. Blitzer , Chairman of the Index Committee at Standard & Poor's .
Housing glut .
Michael Strauss , chief economist at investment firm Commonfund , says that steep price declines are no surprise , given the number of homes on the market .
" When inventory is so high we 're likely to see a decline in prices , " he said .
Cities like Las Vegas and Miami , where speculative buyers helped fuel the housing boom , are seeing sharp reversals .
" Some of the cities that soared the most are now retracting the most , " according to Strauss .
" Though it may be disappointing to some , from an economic stand point it makes a lot of sense . "
Silver lining .
The Case / Shiller data comes one day after a report from the National Association of Realtors that showed a modest increase in sales of existing single - family homes in January , thanks to the plunge in prices .
Mike Schenk , senior economist for the Credit Union National Association , says the decline in home prices is a symptom of serious economic problems , but adds that the environment is improving for home buyers .
" Affordability is actually quite high , " he said .
" This is a pretty good market to consider taking the plunge .
And it 's going to get better as we go forward . "
Subprime fallout .
Across the nation , the market for lower - priced homes has been the most volatile over the last 12 months , a phenomenon Shiller thinks is a result of the ongoing subprime crisis .
" It 's going to take those markets a long time to recover , " Shiller said .
And the housing crisis , in turn , has rocked Wall Street .
The Case / Shiller indexes compare the sale prices of the exact same homes .
The industry considers this survey to be among the most accurate snapshots of housing prices .
The Chechen rebel leader who claimed responsibility for the Beslan school massacre and the Moscow theatre siege has been killed , Russian media reported today .
Russia 's Itar - Tass news agency reported that Shamil Basayev , who led the most violent wing of the Chechen separatist movement , had been killed overnight in the Russian republic of Ingushetia , to the west of Chechnya .
The Russian president , Vladimir Putin , was quoted as saying that Basayev 's killing was " deserved retribution " for terror attacks carried out by his group .
Itar - Tass also quoted the head of Russia 's FSB intelligence service saying that Basayev had intended to " put political pressure on the Russian leadership " during the summit of the G8 nations scheduled for this week in St Petersburg .
The remarks appear to allude to plans of a terrorist attack during the meeting , which is due to begin on Saturday .
Basayev was the most feared of all Chechen terrorist leaders , and relished his image as a ruthless and brutal killer .
His is the most significant scalp to have been claimed by Russian forces in their fight against Chechen separatists .
Alu Alkhanov , the president of Chechnya 's Kremlin - backed government , said Basayev 's death would be a major step forward in the attempt to suppress the Chechen insurgency .
" I consider that today can be considered the date of the logical end of the fight against illegal armed formations , " he told Interfax news agency .
Russian forces have killed several prominent Chechen leaders since the assassination of the separatist president Aslan Maskhadov last year .
Last month , Maskhadov 's successor , Abdul - Khalim Sadulayev , was killed and his bloodied body displayed after he was betrayed by one of his lieutenants in exchange for money to buy heroin , according to Russian officials .
But Basayev was more feared than either of those men , who were both mainly political rather than military figures .
His characteristic operation was the hostage siege , but his troops were also feared for suicide bombings and more conventional operations .
The 41 - year - old first rose to prominence during the first Chechen civil war in the mid-1990s as commander of a battalion of 2,000 fighters who fought running battles with Russian troops in the battle for the Chechen capital Grozny .
Following the failure of the Chechen military campaign , Basayev ordered the invasion of a hospital in the Russian town of Budyonnovsk and held around 1,600 people hostage until the siege was broken , with the deaths of 129 people .
After losing the 1996 Chechen presidential election to the more moderate Maskhadov he was briefly appointed Chechen prime minister in 1998 , but returned to guerrilla warfare the following year as the Russian military won back more control over Chechen territory .
Hundreds of civilians have been killed in more than a dozen operations for which he has claimed responsibility since then , most notoriously the 2002 Moscow theatre siege and the 2004 Beslan high school siege .
The former incident resulted in more than 170 deaths after Russian security forces attempted to knock out the hostage - takers with gas , poisoning many of the people they had intended to save .
The Beslan siege ended even more bloodily , with 350 people killed when Russian special forces opened fire on one of the hostage - takers and the terrorists detonated bombs surrounding the children and teachers they had kidnapped .
Basayev justified his actions by pointing to Russia 's brutal occupation of Chechnya , which is thought to have resulted in more than 200,000 deaths of Chechen civilians and military personnel .
He described the ongoing Russian occupation as " genocide " .
" I admit , I 'm a bad guy , a bandit , a terrorist ... but what would you call [ the Russians ] ? " he said in an interview with ABC News last year .
" If they are the keepers of constitutional order , if they are anti-terrorists , then I spit on all these agreements and nice words . "
Just whatever I find on the web
( CNN ) -- " Larry King Live " has devoted lots of time to the views of all the presidential candidates and their backers .
Last week , King spoke to Sen. Hillary Clinton , and there 's a standing invitation to all three candidates to appear as guests on his show any night .
TV host Larry King interviews documentary filmmaker Michael Moore on Wednesday .
On Wednesday night , King spoke to Oscar - winning documentary filmmaker Michael Moore , who in April endorsed Sen. Barack Obama .
Not surprisingly , Moore did n't hold anything back .
Larry King :
When you were last here in February , you said you had opinions on the race , but were not endorsing anybody .
What changed ?
Michael Moore :
Well , I think that the whole movement behind Obama is very impressive .
And I think it 's a good thing for the country .
As far as Obama as a candidate , I think that this is a very decent individual .
And I 've been just impressed through the various debates as to how he 's handled himself , how he has responded to the issues and responded to people .
King :
What about how he 's handled the Rev. [ Jeremiah ]
Wright thing ?
Moore : Jeez , you know , I mean I go to Mass still .
I 'm a practicing Catholic .
I 've been that way all my life .
But if I had -- if I had gotten up every time I heard a priest from the pulpit in my travels around the country say things like I 've heard them say , that birth control is a sin , that women should not be priests , that women should have a different role in church ...
King :
You'd be walking out all the time ?
Moore : I would have been walking out so much -- that would have been so much aerobic activity for me ... I would n't look like this .
King : OK .
You announced your endorsement of Obama on April 21 in a letter on your Web site .
You also slammed Hillary Clinton .
...
Why so rough ?
Moore :
Well , I supported her run for Senate .
My wife and I contributed to her campaign .
But the huge disappointment was when she was presented with an opportunity for a moment -- a profile in courage moment in October of 2002 -- to not give Bush the authorization to go to war , she voted for war .
And she continued to vote for war for the years after that ... and I 'm disappointed in that .
But when I said [ I was ] ' disgusted , ' that came with the ABC debate .
When she threw out [ Nation of Islam leader Louis ] Farrakhan , when she said the word Farrakhan and Hamas -- to somehow attach that to Sen.
Obama --
I just thought that was beneath everything that she used to stand for .
And I think at some point , she 's going to be disappointed in herself for having done that .
Watch Moore discuss his support for Obama »
King :
Are you so disappointed that you would consider , if she got the nomination , [ voting ] for [ Sen. John ] McCain ?
Moore : Absolutely not .
No , no , no ... most people I know are just going to stagger into the voting booth in November and look for the big " D " on the ballot .
And it really is n't going to matter what the name is on there , whether it 's ...
King :
You think a Democrat 's going to win ?
Moore : Yes . ...
We 've been through eight years of misery .
And it 's not just the war , although that should be enough right there .
But it 's everything from what people are paying for gas now to our health care mess and everything else in this country that has just -- we 've lost so much time .

King :
Do n't you think , Michael , that the Democrats [ are ] the one party that can figure out a way to lose this ?
Moore :
It 's not about the Democratic Party .
This has gone beyond that .
That 's what 's so great about Obama is that he 's not a partisan person in that way .
King :
Do you think the Rev. Wright thing is over ?
Moore :
It 's over when cable news decides it 's over ... and when these networks come up with something new .
I mean , I was kind of enjoying the flag lapel controversy .
By the way , Larry King , where is your flag lapel pin ?
I do n't see it on you .
King :
Where 's yours ?
Moore :
Well , I 'm wearing mine .
That 's right .
It 's the world 's smallest flag lapel pin .
...
You just can't see it .
King : Microscopic .
Moore :
That 's why you do n't wear a coat , so you do n't have to wear the flag lapel pin .
King :
So you found me out .
Moore :
Yes , that 's right .
King : How are [ Americans ] going to turn out and vote -- what percentage ?
Moore : I think we 're going to have a huge turnout this year .
People are crying uncle right now with what they 've had to go through , and they 're not going to want four more years of this .
In spite of whatever concerns they may have about Sen. Obama , or if it turns out to be Sen.
Clinton [ who is the nominee ] ... they 'll put those aside when they think about four more years of what we have had for the last eight years .
That 's not going to go down with the American people .
King :
Are your security guards ready to escort you out ?
Moore : I actually have no security here ... the power of prayer protects me .
King :
As a good Catholic , I understand that .
Moore : I do believe that .
Thank you very much .

The idea of turning farms into fuel plants seemed , for a time , like one of the answers to high global oil prices and supply worries .
That strategy seemed to reach a high point last year when Congress mandated a fivefold increase in the use of biofuels .
But now a reaction is building against policies in the United States and Europe to promote ethanol and similar fuels , with political leaders from poor countries contending that these fuels are driving up food prices and starving poor people .
Biofuels are fast becoming a new flash point in global diplomacy , putting pressure on Western politicians to reconsider their policies , even as they argue that biofuels are only one factor in the seemingly inexorable rise in food prices .
In some countries , the higher prices are leading to riots , political instability and growing worries about feeding the poorest people .
Food riots contributed to the dismissal of Haiti ’s prime minister last week , and leaders in some other countries are nervously trying to calm anxious consumers .
At a weekend conference in Washington , representatives of poor countries that have been hit hard by rising food prices called for urgent action to deal with the price spikes , and several of them demanded a reconsideration of biofuel policies adopted recently in the West .

THE New York Times once epitomised all that was great about American newspapers ; now it symbolises its industry 's deep malaise .
The Grey Lady 's circulation is tumbling , down another 3.9 % in the latest data from America 's Audit Bureau of Circulations ( ABC ) .
Its advertising revenues are down , too ( 12.5 % lower in March than a year earlier ) , as is the share price of its owner , the New York Times Company , up from its January low but still over 20 % below what it was last July .
On Tuesday April 29th Standard & Poor 's cut the firm 's debt rating to one notch above junk .
At the company 's annual meeting a week earlier , its embattled publisher , Arthur “ Pinch ” Sulzberger , attempted to quash rumours that his family is preparing to jettison the firm it has owned since 1896 .
Carnage is expected soon as dozens of what were once the safest jobs in journalism are axed , since too few of the staff have accepted a generous offer of voluntary redundancy .
Pick almost any American newspaper company and you can tell a similar story .
The ABC reported that for the 530 biggest dailies , average circulation in the past six months was 3.6 % lower than in the same period a year earlier ; for Sunday papers , it was 4.6 % lower .
Ad revenues are plunging across the board : by 22.3 % at Media General , for example .
In 2007 total newspaper revenues fell to $ 42.2 billion , not to be sniffed at , certainly , but a lot less than the peak of $ 48.7 billion in 2000 .
Much of this decline is being blamed on the rise of the internet , which offers free , round - the - clock coverage , and which has provided a new , better home for classified advertising , once the bedrock of most newspapers ' revenue .
But some of the fall in revenues is actually due to the economic slowdown in America , and especially in the housing market , which contributes a large slice of classified advertising .
The credit crunch has also come at a bad time for a group of new newspaper owners , who used loans that were readily available until last summer to buy their way into the business , but must now be having second thoughts .
Sam Zell , a property tycoon who bought the Tribune Company , the owner of papers such as the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times , is finding the going harder than expected .
He is trying to sell assets such Newsday , a New York tabloid that is the subject of a bidding war between two other moguls , Mort Zuckerman and Rupert Murdoch , and perhaps other firms .
Mr Murdoch 's enthusiasm is a reminder that not all newspapers are suffering .
He bought the Wall Street Journal last year , and is investing in a vigorous expansion of its political coverage and international news .
This foray on to the traditional turf of the Times seems to be working : the Journal 's circulation is rising .
Another flourishing outlet is the web - only Huffington Post , which is fast evolving beyond a series of political blogs into a fully fledged online newspaper with liberal sensibilities close to those of the New York Times .
Industry experts such as Lauren Rich Fine of Kent State University do not think that the Times is responding forcefully enough .
“ Now is the time to beef up its business section , ” she says .
Ms Fine also points out that although all newspapers are being buffeted by the internet , their ability to respond will probably depend on whether their audiences are national , metropolitan or local .
The first category can afford to invest in distinctive international or business coverage , while the last can prosper by becoming “ more intensely local ” .
But she fears for the big metropolitan newspapers , which may find themselves trapped in the middle .
Not all is lost , however .
Plenty of innovation is taking place , particularly at local papers , as the latest “ Newspaper Next ” report from the American Press Institute , an industry group , makes clear .
It quotes 24 examples of newspapers becoming “ information and connection utilities ” , through such offerings as local internet forums .
The hero for industry optimists is Brian Tierney , a former public - relations executive who led a group of investors that borrowed heavily to buy Philadelphia 's two main dailies .
He has since revived them with a vigorous marketing drive .
He is also finding new ways to drum up advertising , such as introducing a business column sponsored by a local bank .
People said pigs will fly before our circulation rises , Mr Tierney recalled in a recent speech , before recounting how he celebrated a rise in circulation by projecting flying pigs onto the walls of the Philadelphia Inquirer .
Rising gas and food prices have forced us to change our lifestyle .
But there is an upside .
The kids and I spend more time at home doing the free things like playing games and going for walks .
These types of activities create a much stronger bond with your child than going to the movies or sports game where you do n't interact as much .
When food shopping , we buy more fruits and veggies instead of prepared foods .
It saves money and is healthier .
We also cut back cable to just the basic stations .
Again , the effect was less TV and more quality time .
Spending less money also means doing less so there is more free time to do those free projects around the house .
For example , cleaning out the garage , basement and closets of all the useless clutter .
I 've found many treasures that can be sold on Ebay or at a garage sale .
The result is a cleaner , more organized home which in turn reduces stress and anxiety .
It was thought that the Department for Transport had decided to focus on how drivers were taught before the test , rather than imposing restrictions after they had passed it .
The warnings were going straight to President Bush each morning in his briefings by the CIA director , George Tenet , and in the presidential daily briefings .
It would later be revealed by the 9/11 commission into the September 11 attacks that more than 40 presidential briefings presented to Bush from January 2001 through to September 10 , 2001 , included references to bin Laden .
And nearly identical intelligence landed each morning on the desks of about 300 other senior national security officials and members of Congress in the form of the senior executive intelligence brief , a newsletter on intelligence issues also prepared by the CIA .
The senior executive briefings contained much of the same information that was in the presidential briefings but were edited to remove material considered too sensitive for all but the President and his top aides to see .
Often the differences between the two documents were minor , with only a sentence or two changed between them .
Apart from the commission 's chief director , Philip Zelikow , the commission 's staff was never granted access to Bush 's briefings , except for the notorious August 2001 briefing that warned of the possibility of domestic al - Qaeda strikes involving hijackings .
But they could read through the next best thing : the senior executive briefings .
During his 2003 investigations it was startling to Mike Hurley , the commission member in charge of investigating intelligence , and the other investigators on his team , just what had gone on in the spring and summer of 2001 - just how often and how aggressively the White House had been warned that something terrible was about to happen .
Since nobody outside the Oval Office could know exactly what Tenet had told Bush during his morning intelligence briefings , the presidential and senior briefings were Tenet 's best defence to any claim that the CIA had not kept Bush and the rest of the Government well - informed about the threats .
They offered a strong defence .
The team 's investigators began to match up the information in the senior briefings and they pulled together a timeline of the headlines just from the senior briefings in the northern spring and summer :
" Bin Ladin Planning Multiple Operations " ( April 20 ) and " Bin Ladin Threats Are Real " ( June 30 ) It was especially troubling for Hurley 's team to realise how many of the warnings were directed to the desk of one person : Condoleezza Rice , the National Security Adviser .
Emails from the National Security Council 's counter - terrorism director , Richard Clarke , showed that he had bombarded Rice with messages about terrorist threats .
He was trying to get her to focus on the intelligence she should have been reading each morning in the presidential and senior briefings " Bin Ladin Public Profile May Presage Attack " ( May 3 )
" Terrorist Groups Said Co-operating on US Hostage Plot " ( May 23 ) " Bin Ladin's Networks ' Plans Advancing " ( May 26 ) " Bin Ladin Attacks May Be Imminent "
( June 23 ) " Bin Ladin and Associates Making Near - Term Threats " ( June 25 )
" Bin Ladin Planning High - Profile Attacks " ( June 30 ) , " Planning for Bin Ladin Attacks Continues , Despite Delays " ( July 2 )
Other parts of the Government did respond aggressively and appropriately to the threats , including the Pentagon and the State Department .
On June 21 , the US Central Command , which controls American military forces in the Persian Gulf , went to " delta " alert - its highest level - for American troops in six countries in the region .
The American embassy in Yemen was closed for part of the summer ; other embassies in the Middle East closed for shorter periods .
But what had Rice done at the NSC ?
If the NSC files were complete , the commission 's historian Warren Bass and the others could see , she had asked Clarke to conduct inter- agency meetings at the White House with domestic agencies , including the Federal Aviation Administration and the FBI , to keep them alert to the possibility of a domestic terrorist strike .
She had not attended the meetings herself .
She had asked that the then attorney - general , John Ashcroft , receive a special briefing at the Justice Department about al - Qaeda threats .
But she did not talk with Ashcroft herself in any sort of detail about the intelligence .
Nor did she have any conversations of significance on the issue with the FBI director , Louis Freeh , nor with his temporary successor that summer , the acting director Tom Pickard .
There is no record to show that Rice made any special effort to discuss terrorist threats with Bush .
The record suggested , instead , that it was not a matter of special interest to either of them that summer .
Bush seemed to acknowledge as much in an interview with Bob Woodward of The Washington Post that Bush almost certainly regretted later .
In the interview in December 2001 , only three months after the attacks , Bush said that " there was a significant difference in my attitude after September 11 " about al - Qaeda and the threat it posed to the United States .
Before the attacks , he said : " I was not on point , but I knew he was a menace , and I knew he was a problem .
I knew he was responsible , or we felt he was responsible , for the previous bombings that killed Americans .
I was prepared to look at a plan that would be a thoughtful plan that would bring him to justice , and would have given the order to do that .
I have no hesitancy about going after him .
But I did n't feel that sense of urgency , and my blood was not nearly as boiling . "
If anyone on the White House staff had responsibility for making Bush 's blood " boil " that summer about Osama bin Laden , it was Rice .
The members of Mike Hurley 's team were also alarmed by the revelations , week by week , month by month , of how close the commission 's chief director , Philip Zelikow , was to Rice and others at the White House .
They learned early on about Zelikow 's work on the Bush transition team in 2000 and early 2001 and about how much antipathy there was between him and Richard Clarke .
They They heard the stories about Zelikow 's role in developing the " pre-emptive war " strategy at the White House in 2002 .
Zelikow 's friendships with Rice and others were a particular problem for Warren Bass , since Rice and Clarke were at the heart of his part of the investigation .
It was clear to some members of team that they could not have an open discussion in front of Zelikow about Rice and her performance as National Security Adviser .
They could not say openly , certainly not to Zelikow 's face , what many on the staff came to believe : that Rice 's performance in the spring and summer of 2001 amounted to incompetence , or something not far from it .
David Kay , the veteran American weapons inspector sent to Iraq by the Bush Administration in 2003 to search for weapons of mass destruction , passed word to the commission that he believed Rice was the " worst national security adviser " in the history of the job .
For Hurley 's team , there was a reverse problem with Clarke .
It was easy to talk about Clarke in Zelikow 's presence , as long as the conversation centred on Clarke 's failings at the NSC and his purported dishonesty .
Long before Bass had seen Clarke 's files , Zelikow made it clear to the team 's investigators that Clarke should not be believed , that his testimony would be suspect .
He argued that Clarke was a braggart who would try to rewrite history to justify his errors and slander his enemies , Rice in particular .
The commission had decided that in its private interviews with current and former government officials , witnesses would be placed under oath when there was a substantial reason to doubt their truthfulness .
Zelikow argued that Clarke easily fell into that category ; Clarke , he decreed , would need to be sworn in .
When he finally got his security clearance and was allowed into the reading room , Bass discovered he could make quick work of Rice 's emails and internal memos on the al - Qaeda threat in the spring and summer of 2001 .
That was because there was almost nothing to read , at least nothing that Rice had written herself .
Either she committed nothing to paper or email on the subject , which was possible since so much of her work was conducted face - to - face with Bush , or terrorist threats were simply not an issue that had interested her before September 11 .
Her speeches and public appearances in the months before the attacks suggested the latter .
Tipped off by an article in The Washington Post , the commission discovered the text of a speech that she had been scheduled to make on September 11 , 2001 - the speech was canceled in the chaos following the attacks - in which Rice planned to address " the threats of today and the day after , not the world of yesterday " .
The speech , which was intended to outline her broad vision on national security and to promote the Bush Administration 's plans for a missile defence system , included only a passing reference to terrorism and the threat of radical Islam .
On the day that Osama bin Laden launched the most devastating attack on the United States since Pearl Harbour , bin Laden 's terrorist network was seen by Rice as only a secondary threat , barely worth mentioning .
But if Rice had left almost no paper trail on terrorism in 2001 , Clarke 's files were everything that Bass could have hoped for .
Clarke wrote down much of what he saw and heard at the White House , almost to the point of obsession when it came to al - Qaeda .
Bass and his colleagues could see that Clarke had left a rich narrative of what had gone so wrong at the NSC in the months before September 11 , albeit filtered through the writings of the very opinionated Clarke .
Repeatedly in 2001 , Clarke had gone to Rice and others in the White House and pressed them to move , urgently , to respond to a flood of warnings about an upcoming and catastrophic terrorist attack by Osama bin Laden .
The threat , Clarke was arguing , was as dire as anything that he or the CIA had ever seen .
He pushed for an early meeting in 2001 with Bush to brief him about bin Laden 's network and the " nearly existential " threat it represented to the United States .
But Rice rebuffed Clarke .
She allowed him to give a briefing to Bush on the issue of cyber terrorism , but not on bin Laden ; she told Clarke the al - Qaeda briefing could wait until after the White House had put the finishing touches that summer on a broader campaign against bin Laden .
She moved Clarke and his issues off centre stage - in part at the urging of Zelikow and the transition team .
Bass told colleagues that he gasped when he found a memo written by Clarke to Rice on September 4 , 2001 , exactly a week before the attacks , in which Clarke seemed to predict what was just about to happen .
It was a memo that seemed to spill out all of Clarke 's frustration about how slowly the Bush White House had responded to the cascade of terrorist threats that summer .
The note was terrifying in its prescience .
" Are we serious about dealing with the al - Qaeda threat ? " he asked Rice .
" Decision makers should imagine themselves on a future day when the CSG [ Counterterrorism Security Group ] has not succeeded in stopping al - Qaeda attacks and hundreds of Americans lay dead in several countries , including the US .
Bass 's colleagues said he knew instantly that the September 4 email was so sensitive - and potentially damaging , especially to Rice - that the White House would never voluntarily release a copy to the commission or allow him to take notes from the room if they came close to reproducing its language .
Under a written agreement between the commission and the White House , notes could not " significantly reproduce " the wording of a classified document .
Bass decided he would have to try to memorise it in pieces , several sentences at a time , and then rush back to the commission to bat them out on a computer keyboard .
The day he discovered the document , Bass all but burst into the commission 's offices and rushed over to Hurley .
" Holy shit , chief , " Bass said excitedly .
" You wo n't believe what I found . "
He told Hurley that Clarke 's September 4 memo was a " document that grabs you by the throat , a document that you write when you 're at the end of your tether - or well past it " , as Clarke clearly was in the weeks before September 11 .
Hurley instantly understood the significance of what he was being told by Bass .
The question for both men was whether Zelikow would allow them to share any of it with the public .
Months later , Bass could not take it any longer .
He was going to quit , or least threaten to quit , and he was going to make it clear that Zelikow 's attempts at interference - his efforts to defend Rice and demean Clarke - were part of the reason why .
He marched into the office of Dan Marcus , the general counsel , to announce his threat to leave the investigation .
" I cannot do this , " he declared to Marcus , who was already well aware of Bass 's unhappiness .
" Zelikow is making me crazy . "
He was outraged by Zelikow and the White House ; Bass felt the White House was trying to sabotage his work by its efforts to limit his ability to see certain documents from the NSC files and take useful notes from them .
Marcus urged him to calm down : " Let 's talk this through . "
But Bass made it clear to colleagues that he believed Zelikow was interfering in his work for reasons that were overtly political - intended to shield the White House , and Rice in particular , from the commission 's criticism .
For every bit of evidence gathered by Bass and Hurley 's team to bolster Clarke 's allegation that the White House had ignored terrorist threats in 2001 , Zelikow would find some reason to disparage it .
Marcus and Hurley managed to talk Bass out of resigning , although the threat lingered until the final weeks of the investigation .
On May 15 , 2002 , CBS network reported that a daily briefing presented to Bush a few weeks before the September 11 attacks warned him specifically about the threats of a domestic hijacking by al - Qaeda .
Instead of releasing the briefing or at least offering a detailed explanation of what was in the document , the White House chose to have Rice hold a news conference at the White House in which she raised as many questions about the briefing as she answered .
It would later become clear to many of the commission 's members and its staff that she had tried to mislead the White House press corps about the contents of the briefing .
She acknowledged that Bush had received a briefing about possible al - Qaeda hijackings , but she claimed that the brief offered " historical information " and " was not a warning - there was no specific time , place , or method " .
She failed to mention , as would later be clear , that the briefing focused entirely on the possibility that al - Qaeda intended to strike within the United States ; it cited relatively recent FBI reports of possible terrorist surveillance of government buildings in New York .
Tom Kean , the commission 's chairman , could not deny the thrill of this .
A former governor of New Jersey who had left politics to become president of Drew University in his home state , Kean took a seat in the reading room in the New Executive Office building where the commission was reviewing the White House 's most secret files .
Kean was handed a sheaf of presidential briefings from the Clinton and Bush administrations .
Here in his hands were the documents that the White House had been so determined for so long to keep from him .
Lee Hamilton liked to refer to the briefings as the " holy of holies " - the ultimate secret documents in the government - and Kean assumed that must be the case .
" I thought this would be the definitive secrets about al - Qaeda , about terrorist networks and all the other things that the President should act on , " he said .
" I was going to find out the most important things that a president had learned . "
He assumed they would contain " incredibly secretive , precise , and accurate information about anything under the sun . "
Each brief was only several pages long , so Kean could read through months of them in a stretch of a few hours .
And he found himself terrified by what he was reading , really terrified .
Here were the digests of the most important secrets that were gathered by the CIA and the nation 's other spy agencies at a cost of tens of billions of dollars a year .
And there was almost nothing in them .
" They were garbage , " Kean said .
" There really was nothing there - nothing , nothing . "
If students back at Drew turned in term papers this badly researched , " I would have given them an F , " he said .
Kean pointed that out to one of his White House minders who accompanied him to the reading room .
" I 've read all this , " he told the minder in astonishment .
A lot of the information in the briefings and other supposedly top secret intelligence reports had already been revealed by the nation 's big news organisations .
" I already knew this . "
" Oh , but you 're missing the point , " the minder replied .
" Now you know it 's true . "
It occurred to Kean that this might be the commission 's most frightening discovery of all :
The emperors of espionage had no clothes .
Perhaps the reason the White House had fought so hard to block the commission 's access to the briefings was that they revealed how ignorant the Government was of the threats it faced before September 11 .
Kean could understand their fear .
Imagine the consequences if al - Qaeda and its terrorist allies knew how little the US really knew about them .
Commission member Jamie Gorelick , who , along with Zelikow , was given access to the larger universe of briefings , was more impressed by the documents than Kean had been .
Or at least she was less unimpressed .
She knew the Bush Administration was right to complain that much of the intelligence in the briefs in the months before September 11 was maddeningly non-specific about a possible date or place of an attack .
Some of the intelligence in the briefs was " paltry " ; sometimes the information contradicted itself from one day to the next , Gorelick said .
But she was astonished by the sheer volume of the warnings .
Flood , cascade , tsunami , take your pick of metaphors .
She could see that in the spring and summer of 2001 , there was a consistent drum beat of warnings , day after day , that al - Qaeda was about to attack the United States or its allies .
It was clear to Gorelick that the CIA had gone to Bush virtually every morning for months in 2001 to give him the message that the United States needed to be ready for a catastrophic terrorist strike , and from what she was reading , no one ruled out the possibility of a domestic attack .
" Something is being planned , something spectacular , " she said , summarising what the President had been told by George Tenet and what Bush should have read in the briefings .
" We do n't know what it is , we do n't know where it is , but something is happening . "
She said CIA analysts were trying to tell Bush , as bluntly as they could , that the threat in those months was " the worst thing they 've ever seen - an unprecedented threat , " worse than the threats before the millennium .
It seemed to Gorelick that Rice had " assumed away the hardest part of her job " as national security adviser - gathering the best intelligence available to the White House and helping the President decide how to respond to it .
Whatever her job title , Rice seemed uninterested in actually advising him .
Instead , she wanted to be his closest confidant - specifically on foreign policy - and to simply translate his words into action .
Rice had wanted to be " the consigliere to the President " , Gorelick thought .
Domestic issues seemed to bore her .
Her deputy , Stephen Hadley , had told the commission something remarkable in his private interview the month before :
He and Rice had not seen themselves as responsible for co-ordinating the FBI and other domestic agencies about terrorism .
But if they were n't responsible , who was ?
There was no separate domestic security adviser in the White House .
They had just demoted Clarke .
At the time of her May 2002 news conference , no reporter had a copy of the presidential briefing .
CBS had broken the story of its existence but had few details of what was actually in the document .
So the White House press corps would have to trust Rice 's description of what was in it .
She described it as a " warning briefing but an analytic report " about al - Qaeda threats and said that it contained " the most generalised kind of information - there was no time , there was no place , there was no method of attack " mentioned apart from a " very vague " concern about hijacking .
" I want to reiterate , " she said .
" It was not a warning . "
Asked if September 11 did n't represent an intelligence failure by the Administration , she replied almost testily : " I do n't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Centre , take another one and slam it into the Pentagon - that they would try to use an airplane as a missile . "
Rice 's news conference came eight months after the attacks .
Yet she was suggesting that in all that time , no one had bothered to tell her that there were indeed several reports prepared within the CIA , the aviation administration , and elsewhere in the Government about the threat of planes as missiles .
Had no one told her in all those months that the Department of Defence had conducted drills for the possibility of a plane - as - missile attack on the Pentagon ?
Had she forgotten that when she and Bush attended the G8 summit in Italy in July 2001 , the airspace was closed because of the threat of an aerial suicide attack by al - Qaeda ?
Commission member Tim Roemer made it his goal to get the August 6 briefing made public and to prove once and for all that Rice and her White House colleagues had a concept of the truth about September 11 that was , at best , " flexible " .
To Roemer , Rice had long ago passed the " threshold " between spin and dishonesty .
" She 'd lost credibility with me , " he said .
The question among the Democratic commissioners was whether anybody would be brave enough to go public to question Rice 's competence and her honesty .
Much as the staff felt beaten down by Zelikow , so did the other Democratic commissioners .
By the end , they had given up the fight to document the more serious failures of Bush , Rice , and others in the Administration in the months before September .
Zelikow would never have permitted it .
Nor , they realised , would Kean and Hamilton .
The Democrats hoped the public would read through the report and understand that September 11 did not have to happen - that if the Bush Administration had been more aggressive in dealing with the threats flooding into the White House from January 2001 through to September 10 , 2001 , the plot could have been foiled .
The Clinton administration could not duck blame for having failed to stop bin Laden before 2001 .
But what had happened in the White House in the first eight months of George Bush 's presidency had all but guaranteed that 19 young Arab men with little more than pocket knives , a few cans of mace , and a misunderstanding of the tenets of Islam could bring the US to its knees .

One of the most terrifying parts of any science fiction movie or TV show are the inevitable Future Jumpsuits that everyone seems to wear because somehow every aspect of civilization has advanced except clothing technology .
Whether you ’re in Battlestar Galactica ’s space fatigues , Star Trek ’s onesie uniforms , or whatever the hell you call that crap Jean - Paul Gaultier forced upon the hapless actors in The Fifth Element , it still boils down to one thing :
The many moods of the jumpsuit .
Below , we explore four of the most popular jumpsuits in science fiction for your sartorial edification .
Space Fatigues
Seen in BSG , Farscape , Starship Troopers ( below ) , and pretty much anywhere you ’ve got a military - style group zooming around in space .
Usually featuring an insignia with a swooshy ship or stars , lots of zippers , and maybe some kind of ammo belt , space fatigues get one crucial thing wrong .
In the future , presumably we ’ll have decent - enough nanotech armor that military types can wear ultra- lightweight clothing that looks like whatever they want and it will still be blaster - proof , and capable of hardening into splints when needed .
Plus , zippers in the future ?
Really ?
Space fatigues do , of course , have their dressier sides .

The Unisex Onesie
Advertisement
Why do all futuristic space - faring people have these frakkin onesies ?
It ’s partly Star Trek ’s fault , with their awful polyester uniforms .
But something about space just makes people think “ boxy onesie . ”
Even in the 1980s Buck Rogers ( right ) , which was all about making space sexier , they still had the onsies , albeit in ultratight white and sometimes shiny colors .
Plus , they all had these great rainbow armbands to go with their onesies , to make it seem as if in the future gay people would rule the world but no longer shop at The Gap .
A subset of the unisex onesie is also the Facist Identity - Erasure Onesie , which you see in THX - 1138 .

The Holy Crap What the Hell Uniform
The “ holy crap what the hell ” outfits of Sci-Fi Channel ’s Dune miniseries and the movie The Fifth Element are a handy way to get at what this style is really all about .
Basically , in the future we wo n’t wear onesies ( thankfully ) but instead we ’ll have wrapped ourselves in gauze tape to cover just the naughty bits — or for some reason we will wear really tall strange hats .
Dune , at least in the Sci-Fi imagining of it , is basically a future where strange headgear have taken over .
And do n’t even get me started on Sting ’s outfit in David Lynch ’s Dune movie .
It really makes you appreciate the versatility of the phrase “ holy crap what the hell ? ! ”

Gwar
I ’m glad that the styles pioneered by rock band Gwar have survived into the future , alternate dimensions , and every other nook and cranny of the science fiction universe .
For some reason , when people are n’t doing what - the - crap with their outfits , or squirming into an impossibly tight onesie , they ’re dressed in leathers and crazy giant boots .
With capes , too , sometimes .
The Klingons do it ; the Hawkmen in Flash Gordon do it ; why should n’t the entire future of

civilization do it too ?
I should point out that there are a couple of Gwar fashion corollaries .
There is the Nine Inch Nails look , shown off in Farscape quite a bit , as well as inside the Matrix .
Then there is the Hippie Shift look , which you see a lot in Star Wars and incidentally also in the Matrix when people are outside the Matrix ’s Nine Inch Nails sartorial zone .
In fact , who could forget the shocking displays of Hippie Shifts during the rave scene in Matrix : Reloaded ?
You cannot wash your eyes out with soap and make the memory go away .

Is any fact - checker in the Mother Jones San Francisco office able to lend Bill Clinton a hand ?
On the campaign trail recently , he echoed the Clinton campaign ’s argument that the pressure Hillary Clinton is facing to quit the Democratic race is “ unprecedented ” and that primary races routinely last into June .
It ’s particularly odd because Bill was part of a race where also - ran candidates were pressured to get out and the frontrunner , Big Dawg himself , had the nomination wrapped up in March .
Here ’s the NYT fact - check that disproves all this .
Look , I love Bill as much as the next guy , and I ’m weary of the Clinton pile - ons ( the RFK assassination stuff was nonsense and we did n’t touch it here on MoJoBlog ) , but Bill is either deliberately misleading Hillary ’s supporters or he ’s completely resorted his memory and convinced himself of something that is n’t true .
And this is far from the first time he ’s done this .
Remember when he defended Hillary ’s sniper fire comments ?
He made so many errors that ABC had to footnote them .
He claimed after South Carolina that the Obama campaign had played the race card on him , then denied that he had ever said that .
While Hillary Clinton gets something wrong , the press usually debunks it immediately .
But Bill Clinton largely gets a pass .
Something ’s going on here .
Possible explanations are below .
Give us yours in the comments .
(1) Bill is n’t running , so he ’s given less scrutiny .
The first half is obviously correct but the second half is n’t .
Bill ’s flubs do draw attention , they just do n’t draw out the fact - checker hidden inside every journalist .
And they do n’t seem to attract much ire .
(2) He ’s rusty and out of practice on the stump , so the media gives him a pass .
This time it ’s the first half that ’s wrong .
Bill ’s been stumping for Hillary for over half a year now .
The “ rusty ” argument does n’t fly .
(3) Bill is so devoted to his wife and her cause that he ’s either bending the facts to make the case for her or he ’s convinced himself that the misrepresentations he ’s uttering are true .
The media will give someone a pass when their psychology is laid so bare .
(4) Bill is desperately trying to show his wife and the world that he ’s making amends for mistreating her for decades .
The media will give someone a pass when they look so pathetic in front of millions .
(5) He ’s America ’s lovable ex-president and he can say whatever he wants .
Even Obama - lovers kinda roll their eyes when he gets stuff wrong .
(6) He ’s seen as a zany , cranky old man — despite being nine years younger than John McCain — whose time on the national stage is over .
Everyone will just tolerate him for a little while longer and then he ’ll go back to eating barbecue in Arkansas .
Or jetting around with Ron Burkle .
If you ’re looking for a single explanation , you wo n’t find one here .
I do n’t have a unified theory to explain Bill Clinton ’s actions .
If I had to guess , I ’d say it ’s a combination of numbers three through six .
As always with the Democrats ’ first couple , it ’s complicated .
Never allow stains , dirt or any damages that come from precipitation , moisture or water spills on your shoes .
You can easily take control of this .

Pokemon ?
Go Poke Yourself , Satan !
Landover Baptist Christian Action Alert !
FREEHOLD IOWA - Landover Baptist Pastor , Deacon Fred used a blowtorch and a sword Sunday morning to demonstrate that Pokemon games and toys are only sugar - coated instruments of the occult and evil .
Earlier this week at Landover 's Wednesday evening service , children 's pastor Marty Richards told 714 kids ages 2 through 10 that Pokemon is evil and was sent to this planet under direct orders from Satan himself .
To drive home his point , Richards burned Pokemon trading cards and video games with a blowtorch and skewered 14 plastic Pokemon action figures with a 40 inch broad sword .
Richards then held the sword with all 14 pierced Pokemon figures over a charcoal grill .
Richards ' 5 - year - old son tore the limbs and head off a Pokemon doll and spit on the dismembered carcass .
During the demonstration , the children chanted : " Burn it .
Burn it , '' and " Chop it up .
Chop it up . ''
" Kill them All ! " Manufacturers of the hugely popular Pokemon products , including Nintendo and Hasbro Inc. , lied openly about Pokemon 's association with the occult .
The national Christian Coalition told The Press on Friday that it fully agrees with Landover Baptist 's stand against the ungodly toy industry .
" Toy manufacturers are being guided by Satan 's minions . "
One source stated , " Demons are instructing the Nintendo and Hasbro companies on how to corrupt a child 's innocence and create a future army of junior Satanists that will one day rule the world ! "
" We agree with Pastor Deacon Fred , and The Landover Baptist Corporation , '' said William Barnes , a spokesman for the national Christian Coalition based in Virginia .
" It 's a policy issue , a church issue , and a national security issue .
We know all about it .
We currently fund over 15 campaigns against the Pokemon menace . ''
Pokemon , ( pronounced POH - kaymahn ) , is short for pocket demons .
The Devil loving phenomenon began in Japan over 20 years ago .
A young boy summoned an evil demon to kill his entire family because they would n't buy him a stick of chewing gum at the supermarket .
The demon came , and brought with it , other pokemons who jumped into the parents mouths while they were sleeping , and lodged themselves in their tracheas , suffocating an entire family , and setting the boy free to steal their money and buy gum .
" The whole idea behind Pokemon is to show a child that they can become a " powerful evil force , and they do n't have to listen to their parents . ''
Landover occult expert , Jonathan Edwards said .
" Kids look for different Pokemon demons , find them and utilize their specific powers to create chaos in the home .
It can be extremely violent , and the liberal media does not want anyone to know how many families have been torn apart since this menace began .
The ultimate goal for a child is to collect them , and once they 've collected all of them , they can have anything they wish for .
In most cases , the child wishes for complete control over his entire family .
The pokemons approach in the still of night , entering the parents mouths and lodging themselves in their tracheas until they suffocate .
They then scurry off quietly and return to their masters bed .
When authorities arrive , they are shocked to see no evidence of foul play .
They observe only a smiling child , fast asleep , surrounded by stuffed animals and ' innocent little ' Pokemons . "
Deacon Fred , one of 37 co-pastors of the 125,000 - member , fundamentalist - baptist church , said that his " antenna went up " over a year ago .
While driving with his kids , he heard them in the back seat talking about " Abra ' ' and " Cadabra , ' ' " A chill went down my spine , and a trickle of perspiration dribbled slowly down to the small of my back ! "
He pulled the car over , took the Pokemon action figures from his children , placed them on the road , got back into the car and backed over them " 100 times , until there was nothing left but shards of plastic . "
The teary eyed children watched from the roadside .
Pastor Deacon
Fred said that he does n't see why more unsaved folks do n't see the Devil 's hand in this .
" Three of the Pokeman characters sprouts horns ! "
Another concern , he said , is that children exploring a Pokemon Web site can click to other games , including " Magic : the Gathering , '' a Satanic game similar to Dungeons and Dragons .
" It 's got fancy sugar coating on it , but , underneath , it 's Hell 's poison , '' Pastor Deacon Fred said .
Focus on the Family , the Colorado Springs - based Christian organization whose messages reach as many as 5 million people weekly via radio broadcasts , has researched Pokemon , said David Wright , project coordinator the Youth Culture Department .
" What we found , is so horrifying , and so schocking , it would drive an unsaved person to the brink of insanity !
Godly Christians are the only ones who can see this Satanic attack , we do n't expect sinners to understand our ongoing battle with principalities that are not of this world .
We do however , expect them to take us very seriously , and to submit to our ( God 's ) authority in destroying these little beasts before they make junior Satanists out of every child on the planet ! "

Planning the next generation of GTK
The developers of GTK are preparing for a major overhaul that aims to resolve many of the framework 's most significant deficiencies and add next - generation features that will increase flexibility and simplify development .
This effort is still in the earliest planning stage , but several intriguing proposals provide valuable insight into some of the changes envisioned by prominent developers .
GTK is an open - source widget toolkit for developing applications with graphical user interfaces .
It is cross-platform compatible , distributed under the permissive LGPL license , and widely used on the Linux platform .
In addition to being used for popular cross-platform applications like GIMP , Abiword , and Pidgin , GTK also serves as the foundation of the GNOME desktop environment which comes with Ubuntu , Fedora , and numerous other Linux distributions .
GTK is also increasingly being adopted in the mobile space , where it is used by Nokia 's Internet Tablet operating system , OpenMoko , OLPC , and the Access Linux platform .
Imendio's vision
Kristian Rietveld of Imendio — a software company that does custom GTK development and is currently funding a native Mac OS X port of the toolkit — presented a proposal last month at the GTK HackFest in Berlin with a plan for moving forward and addressing many of the weaknesses that GTK developers have identified over the years .
The proposal offers clear goals for a long - term roadmap and makes the case for breaking ABI compatibility .
Topics discussed during the presentation were later clarified in a more detailed position document .
Imendio wants the next generation of GTK to enable development of better user interfaces with sophisticated visual effects , animations , physics , and stacking .
Other desired improvements include stronger OS integration , improved back - end support , increased portability , easier custom widget creation , architecture that makes language bindings easier to maintain , and support for a data abstraction layer .
In order to reduce the maintenance burden placed on third - party developers , the GTK developers have adhered to a strict policy of ABI compatibility for the duration of the GTK 2 development cycle .
This provides an extremely high level of backwards compatibility , but makes it difficult to undertake drastic rewrites or perform major architectural changes .
This incremental approach to development has helped promote GTK adoption , but has also created what many developers believe is an evolutionary impasse .
Imendio's developers argue that the GTK 2 series is a dead end because of the ABI stability guarantees and they say that a clean break will likely be necessary to continue moving forward because the code base contains a lot of legacy cruft and refactoring poses too many obstacles .
To facilitate the break without creating undue stress on third - party developers , they suggest performing scheduled API and ABI breaks at defined intervals ( possibly every five years ) and ensuring that multiple versions of the library can be installed in parallel .
They also want clear policies for deprecating and removing legacy API .
The proposal has been well received by the GTK community and is gaining widespread support among GTK contributors outside of Imendio .
Alberto Ruiz , an independent GTK developer who is contributing to the Windows and Mac OS X ports , attended the event and posted some thoughts about Imendio 's presentation in his blog .
" One of the issues discussed was to provide a predictable release that might break ABI and remove deprecated API , " he wrote .
" The intervals for this are not clear yet , but it sounds like a good idea to me .
Being predictable will let ISVs anticipate this sort of issues , which is better than getting to the situation where Gtk+ can not get any better .
There was n't any decisions taken whatsoever , but the general feeling of agreement is pretty promising . "
I recently wrote a new Erlang project call automake to ease build of Erlang module .
This module is especially useful during development phase .
Erlang is distributed with a make module that build standard Erlang files from information provided in Emakefile files ( See Erlang Make Documentation ) .
However , I get bored having to write and maintained Emakefile manually .
I decided to write a tool to do the job for me and this is what Erlang automake does .
It try to does it “ smartly ” by finding the location of your needed include files and taking this information into account in your Emakefile .
It does much more however .
You can pass several project directories and Erlang automake will build an Erlang Emakefile compiling all you project to a single directory .
This is useful during development as it ease path setting , and simplify dynamic code reload .
This is particularly usefull if you are developing code base on several different repository ( example : code coming from ejabberd main repository , from ejabberd - modules repository and / or some other private projects .
More features are already there or are planned but I will not take about them yet .
The code is developed in ProcessOne contribs Subversion repository and is tracked in ProcessOne Erlang Forge .
Your ideas , comments , patchs , feature requests are of course welcome .
Getting started
Install the Erlang Automake tool somewhere in your path .
You should also install the eautomake script as it acts as a useful wrapper .
Once your done , you can experiment with the following commands :
eautomake : Will generate an Emakefile for the project in the current directory .
It will also create an Eautomake file that describe your project .
: Will generate an Emakefile for the project in the current directory .
It will also create an Eautomake file that describe your project .
eautomake create Dir1 Dir2 … : Create a build file for several directories .
It also generate Eautomake file that kept the lists of your projects directories .
To update your EMakefile , the eautomake command is enough as the project description is then read from Eautomake file .
: Create a build file for several directories .
It also generate Eautomake file that kept the lists of your projects directories .
To update your EMakefile , the eautomake command is enough as the project description is then read from Eautomake file .
eautomake : Will update emakefile to take new Erlang source file into accounts .
“ erl - make ” command is used to compile your project once the Eautomake file has been generated .
CARLSBAD , California ( Reuters ) - News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch on Wednesday predicted a Democratic landslide in the U.S. presidential election against a gloomy economic backdrop over the next 18 months .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Murdoch has yet to endorse a U.S. presidential candidate but considers Barack Obama very promising , the media magnate said in an interview by two Wall Street Journal reporters at an annual conference for high - tech industry insiders .
News Corp recently acquired ownership of the Journal and its parent company Dow Jones & Co .
“ You have got the Obama phenomenon .
You have got , undoubtedly , a recession ...
The average American is really getting hurt financially and that all bodes well for him ( Obama ) , Murdoch said .
“ You have probably the making of a complete phenomenon in this country , ” Murdoch said in describing what he predicted will be a sweeping victory for Democrats in November .
The recent special election for a U.S. Congressional seat held by Republicans in Mississippi showed how powerless that party may be in the face of a rising political tide , Murdoch said .
Democrat Travis Childers won the seat this month .
Murdoch said Obama and John McCain , the expected nominee of the Republican Party , both have a lot of problems , but McCain will be hurt by his party and his close ties to Washington .
Race will be an issue for Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , but “ it looks like he overcomes that , overcomes that totally . ”
Murdoch is associated with conservative political views but has a reputation for a pragmatic streak in major national races where he has shown a willingness to switch sides when he detects major political changes afoot .
“ I think it ( a recession ) is one we will be coming out of for quite some time , ” Murdoch said .
“ In the next 18 months , this country is going to be in for a very hard time . ”
In the 2008 U.S. Presidential race , Murdoch said he is not yet backing anyone , but then quickly added : “ I want to meet Obama .
I want to know if he going to walk the walk . ”
Murdoch said he had played a role in the endorsement by the New York Post , one of his global stable of papers , in endorsing Obama during the Democratic primary with Hillary Clinton in New York .
Yesterday , a reader calling himself " Richard Miller " left behind a critical comment about my meeting with Congressman Nadler in which I will ask him to sponsor a " Sense of the House " resolution calling for climate change policy based on what is scientifically necessary rather than just politically possible .
Richard asked , " How are you going to feel in a few years when your pet causes are proven to be hoaxes and frauds ? "
I thought it would be fun , in today 's post , to answer that question :
First off , almost no one serious , except for oil industry spin doctors ( and welcome , " Richard , " even if you are one ) , discounts climate change anymore .
Even the current Administration accepts that it exists .
Indeed , most political observers agree that the real attacks on science pointing to climate change come from people and organizations who do n't like the regulatory implications .
They find it easier to try to obfuscate the science than to fight the resulting legislation on its merits ( though , " Richard , " if you would like to actually discuss the merits here on the blog , you would be very welcome ) .
Only yesterday , in fact , New York 's Mayor , Michael Bloomberg , called attention to the anti-regulatory attempts to manipulate science .
According to Andy Revkin of the New York Times blog DotEarth , Bloomberg compared climate - change naysayers to tobacco - industry spin-merchants :
[ Bloomberg ] focused on smoking , reviewing how the tobacco industry spent decades sprinkling doubt into discussions of science showing links between smoking ( and secondhand smoke ) and cancer and other illness .
While many wealthy countries have moved to constrain and tax smoking , the world , Mr. Bloomberg said , is still on a path toward a billion smoking - related deaths in this century .
He then shifted to climate and energy , describing how science has been distorted not only by industries and anti-regulatory groups , but also political operatives working within government agencies .
The latest example , Mr. Bloomberg said , was the ongoing politics - driven push to subsidize ethanol from corn .
[ Read the text of Bloomberg 's speech here . ]
But to return to your question , " Richard , " since many of the measures needed to deal with climate change have a lot of positive benefits , if it turns out to not exist , I will first praise God in thanks and then I will think :
I am glad we created 5 million or more new jobs here in the United States in the fields of energy efficiency and renewable generation .
I am glad we created a culture that relies less on foreign oil , so that our children can live secure lives , knowing that the energy rug can't be pulled out from under them .
I am glad we have found a way to save people and industry billions upon billions of dollars by making the use of energy more efficient .
I am glad the millions of children who suffer from asthma can now breathe easier thanks to the fact that we are n't pumping the air full of toxins from our exhaust pipes and smokestacks .
I am glad that , by no longer burning oil and coal into our air , we 've put an end to acid rain and the devastation of our aquatic life .
I am glad that we created good , reliable , fun - to - use public transportation system so that families no longer have to raid their budgets to pay for cars and gas .
I am glad we 've stopped building suburbs , which make people unhappy and are designed for cars not people , and instead build villages where people can have strong community bonds that help make life fulfilling .
I am glad we now have fuel - efficient automobiles .
I am glad that we 've learned as a culture to get off the work - more - to - spend - more treadmill which gobbles up resources and leaves us unfulfilled and instead turned to a way of live full of meaning and purpose .
I am glad we developed local , fresh food systems that care not just about filling bellies but what we put in those bellies .
I am glad that we have rejected the philosophies of survival of the fittest and competition for resources as driving philosophies and have instead embraced a philosophy of compassion and justice .
I am glad that we have understood that a sustainable society cannot work without supporting all of its people and that we looked for and found ways to improve the lives of everyone .
I 'm glad that we 've come to see people rather than things as our most valuable resource and that , in embracing the respectful and loving principles of not wasting , we have learned not to waste youth in prisons but instead to get them help for their drug addictions and alcoholism .
I am glad that , in realizing our resources are limited , we have come to use them to do what is important and to help each other rather than compete with each other .
I am glad that we have come to see education as the ultimate in sustainable industries .
I am glad that we have developed distributed , renewable energy technologies that allow kids in all parts of the world to have electric light so they can learn how to read .
The list goes on and on , but in short , I am glad that we have embraced the opportunities presented by the crisis of climate change in order to improve our society in ways we should have done anyway .
Now , a question for you , " Richard . "
Since I 've answered your question honestly , I hope you 'll do the same with mine .
What would you feel if we went your way and you turned out to be wrong ?
What would you feel if we all assumed , as you do , that we need not do anything about climate change , but then that it turns out that we should have ?
What would you feel if we buried our heads in the sand , ignored the problem , and then irreversibly damaged the planetary habitat that we depend upon for our health , happiness and security ?

Despite criticism , ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos defended his performance in last night ’s Democratic debate , which he co-moderated with Charles Gibson .
“ We asked tough but appropriate questions , ” Stephanopoulos told me by phone this afternoon .
When I asked whether questions about flag pins or Bosnia are actually relevant to voters , he replied : “ Absolutely . ”
“ The vote for the president , ” Stephanopoulos said , “ is one of the most personal ” decisions that someone makes .
“ When people make that choice , they take into account how candidates stand on the issues , ” he said , but also are concerned with “ experience , character [ and ] credibility . ”
“ You ca n’t find a presidential election where those issues did n’t come into play , ” he said .
Stephanopoulos explained that since the candidates are not far apart policy - wise , the “ core of the nomination fight ” has been about these issues .
“ They ’ve been fighting it out on this turf , ” he said , adding that these are things that “ came up between this debate and the last one . ”
This morning , websites like The Huffington Post provided multiple attacks on the debate moderators ( The Gotcha Debate ) , and I asked Stephanopoulos for his reaction to one specific piece of criticism — that of Washington Post critic Tom Shales calling the moderator ’s performances “ shoddy ” and “ despicable . ”
“ I think it just comes with the territory , ” Stephanopoulos replied , adding , “ I think you ’re going to find a wide range of opinions . ”
“ This is an election people are really engaged with , ” he said .
“ They ’ve participated .
They ’ve been watching it .
They ’re speaking their minds . ”
And what about treatment of the candidates ?
NBC ’s Chuck Todd , for instance , noted that “ in the first 40 minutes of the debate , most of the questions were focused on Obama 's negatives . ”
Did Stephanopoulos feel that the " Saturday Night Live " skit mocking how debate moderators have treated Obama was accurate , and that the Illinois senator has gotten off too easy in the past ?
“ I ’m not going to comment on other peoples ' debates , ” he said .
Finally , on the repeated shots of Chelsea Clinton on screen — which Stephanopoulos would n’t have been responsible for since he was down asking the questions — the moderator said he had n’t really thought about it .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Charges against five Guantanamo prisoners accused of plotting the September 11 attacks should be thrown out because they were improperly influenced by a Pentagon legal adviser , U.S. military lawyers said in documents filed on Friday .

Also on Friday , a U.S. military judge postponed the Guantanamo trial of Osama bin Laden ’s driver , Salim Hamdan , until July 21 , to allow time to assess his mental competency .
Hamdan was to be the first prisoner tried in the U.S. war crimes court at the Guantanamo naval base in Cuba .
The Guantanamo tribunals are the first U.S. war crimes tribunals since World War Two and have faced steady criticism from human rights activists and reversals in American courts .
The tribunals were established after September 11 , 2001 to try non-American captives whom the Bush administration considers “ enemy combatants , ” who are not entitled to the legal protections granted to soldiers and civilians .
In the case of alleged September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other prisoners who could face execution if convicted , the military defense lawyers said the charges were tainted by meddling and “ overreaching ” on the part of Air Force Brig .
Gen. Thomas Hartmann .
Hartmann was assigned to provide impartial legal advice to the Pentagon appointee overseeing the Guantanamo trials .
But the former chief prosecutor of the tribunals testified last month that Hartmann essentially took over the prosecution team , pushing it to use evidence obtained through coercion and demanding “ sexy ” cases that would pique the interest of the American public .
Military defense lawyers asked the tribunals ’ chief judge , Marine Col .
Ralph Kohlmann , to dismiss the charges on grounds that Hartmann was so heavily involved in drafting them that he “ failed to retain the required independence . ”
FACING DEATH PENALTY
“ When the government seeks the death penalty , it must not reduce legal procedures to mere formalities .
The integrity of the system must be upheld , regardless of the nature of the crimes charged or identity of the accused , ” they said in the documents .
“ The accused are entitled to due process and a fair trial ”
Mohammed and the other four -- Ali Abdul Aziz Ali , Ramzi Binalshibh , Mustafa Ahmed al - Hawsawi and Walid bin Attash -- were tentatively scheduled for arraignment at Guantanamo on June 5 .
They are accused of conspiring with al Qaeda to murder civilians and with 2,973 counts of murder , one for each person killed on September 11 when hijacked passenger planes crashed into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field .
The judge in the Hamdan case had already barred Hartmann from further involvement in those proceedings .
Hamdan was scheduled to go to trial in early June but a military judge , Navy Capt .
Keith Allred , delayed it until July 21 .
He ordered that a mental competency review be completed by June 13 , for Hamdan , a Yemeni who was to be the first captive tried in the Guantanamo war court .
His lawyers said that more than six years of detention and harsh treatment at Guantanamo had left Hamdan mentally impaired and compromised his ability to assist in his defense .
Hamdan told the judge last month he would boycott his trial because he had no hope of receiving fair treatment .
He would face life in prison if convicted of conspiring with al Qaeda and providing material support for terrorism .
Allred ’s ruling also “ alluded to his desire to await a ruling by the Supreme Court ... that may prove to have applicability to the Hamdan case , ” said a Pentagon spokesman , Lt. Col.
Mark Wright .
The high court is expected to decide by late June whether prisoners held at the U.S. base in Cuba have any rights under the U.S. Constitution .
Military defense lawyers have tried vigorously to delay any trials until after that ruling and it now seems likely they will succeed .
Hamdan was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 after U.S. - led forces invaded to oust the Taliban and their al Qaeda cohorts .
He has said he never joined al Qaeda but took a job in bin Laden ’s motor pool because he needed the $ 200 monthly salary .
Prosecutors say he was a trusted al Qaeda insider who transported weapons for the group and helped bin Laden escape U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
McCain explains Sunni / Shiite ' confusion ' : Al - Qaeda ' not necessarily just Sunni ' David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday April 9 , 2008

Print This Email This Sen. John McCain , defending his recent troubles differentiating between the two major branches of Islam , suggested today that the terror network al - Qaeda encompasses both Sunni and Shi'a .
When asked today by a Fox News host about recent gaffes in which he confused Sunnis and Shiites , the presumptive GOP presidential nominee smiled , shook his head and replied , " I 've been to Iraq eight times , I know the leaders , I know the situation on the ground , I know that Sunni and al - Qaeda are closely tied ...
The question I was asking and the question that needs to be answered is , How widespread is al - Qaeda 's influence in the region as well as in Iraq ?
" I believe that al - Qaeda does a lot of things , " McCain continued , " including with organizations and parts of the populations that are not necessarily just Sunni . "
McCain did not elaborate .
Al - Qaeda is a decidedly Sunni organization , having been founded in 1988 by an alliance of Sunni militant groups around the world .
Iraq , and Iran in particular , are on the other hand predominantly Shiite nations .
Sunnism and Shi'ism are ancient and distinct denominations of Islam .
Some are concerned that the hawkish McCain , a vociferous supporter of the war on terror , is unable or unwilling to clearly discern whom it is allied forces are battling .
Less than a month ago , while visiting Jordan with Sen .
Joe Lieberman , McCain said several times that Iran was supplying al - Qaeda , prompting Lieberman to correct him on - camera .
Just in the last week , McCain has misstated details of the ceasefire in Basra and again confused Sunnis and Shiites while referencing al - Qaeda during a Senate hearing with U.S. commander of allied forces Gen. David Petraeus .

MOSCOW  Dmitri A. Medvedev , the Kremlin insider and unprepossessing lawyer who had never held elected office before , was sworn in as Russia ’s president on Wednesday inside the Grand Kremlin Palace .
The ceremony , mixing czarist splendor with renewed Russian confidence , marked the passing of formal power from the departing president , Vladimir V. Putin , to his untested protégé .
But the events also served as a tribute to the enduring stature and popularity of Mr. Putin , whom Mr. Medvedev nominated as prime minister within hours of taking office .
Mr. Putin , a former intelligence service chief who had presided over Russia ’s economic revival while consolidating power , rolling back civil liberties and leading a government plagued by corruption , arrived at the ceremony alone and before Mr. Medvedev .
Scientist : Ben Stein's ' Expelled ' should really be ' Flunked Out ' Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday April 16 , 2008

Print This Email This Comedian and former Nixon speechwriter Ben Stein 's new documentary , Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , will not open until this Friday , but it has already been widely blasted for its alleged dishonesty and looseness with the facts .
Stein has recently emerged as a prominent spokesperson for so - called " intelligent design , " a pseudo - scientific gloss over the religious philosophy of creationism .
Using film - making techniques clearly borrowed from Michael Moore , Stein set out to confront scientists and educators about their alleged persecution of supporters of intelligent design , whom Stein claims have been " targeted for retaliation and harassment . "
However , the National Center for Science Education has performed an extensive investigation of the " martyrs " profiled in Stein 's file and has found a consistent pattern of misrepresentation .
" We reviewed public records and reports on the intelligent design promoters who were supposedly discriminated against , and we discovered that the claims that they lost their jobs over intelligent design are unsupported , " biologist Josh Rosenau explained .
" That said , professors who are n't making advances in their field , editors who disregard their journal 's established practices , and lecturers who repeat creationist falsehoods should n't be surprised if they have trouble holding jobs .
These people were n't expelled ; they flunked out . "
The controversies over Expelled began last fall , when two supporters of evolution who are interviewed in the film , Professors Richard Dawkins and PZ Myers , claimed that they were tricked into appearing by being told the film would present a serious debate about the " controversy that exists in America between evolution , creationism and the intelligent design movement . "
" At no time was I given the slightest clue that these people were a creationist front , " Dawkins complained .
Stein countered , " I do n't remember a single person asking me what the movie was about . "
Myers recently noted that the producers of Expelled appear to have stolen some of their sequences from PBS and from a small animation company , XVIVO .
Those producers have now counter - sued XVIVO , alleging that its claims are " part of an ongoing campaign attempting to discredit the film and its producers . "
Expelled has also come under fire for its attempt to link a belief in evolution to Nazi genocide .
When its producers offered a private screening to Scientific American , hoping for some sort of positive -- or at least newsworthy -- reaction , editor - in - chief John Rennie was withering in his criticism .
" We could simply ignore the movie , " Rennie wrote .
" Unfortunately , Expelled is a movie not quite harmless enough to be ignored .
Shrugging off most of the film 's attacks  all recycled from previous pro-ID works  would be easy , but its heavy - handed linkage of modern biology to the Holocaust demands a response for the sake of simple human decency . "
Scientific American columnist Michael Shermer , who also appears in the film , expanded further on the Holocaust issue : " Cleverly edited interview excerpts from scientists are interspersed with various black - and - white clips for guilt by association with : bullies beating up on a 98 - pound weakling , Charlton Heston 's character in Planet of the Apes being blasted by a water hose , Nikita Khrushchev pounding his fist on a United Nations desk , East Germans captured trying to scale the Berlin Wall , and Nazi crematoria remains and Holocaust victims being bulldozed into mass graves .
This propaganda production would make Joseph Goebbels proud . "
Shermer pointed out in contrast that Darwinian theory has often been used as the unpinning for a belief in Stein 's preferred doctrine of free market capitalism , a fact of which he found Stein to be " astonishingly ignorant . "
In fact , Shermer notes , Enron 's CEO , Jeffrey Skilling , has said that his favorite book while at Harvard Business School , " was Richard Dawkins ' The Selfish Gene ... a form of Darwinism that Skilling badly misinterpreted . "
Following sometimes bitter debate , the Senate Judiciary Committee voted Tuesday to send Michael B. Mukasey ’s nomination as attorney general to the Senate floor , where confirmation is expected soon .
With two Democrats , Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Charles E. Schumer of New York , joining the nine Republicans on the panel in support of the nomination , the retired federal judge moved a step closer to heading the Justice Department -- despite deep concern about his refusal to declare a coercive interrogation method known as waterboarding to be illegal torture .
The committee vote was 11 to 8 .
The full Senate will consider the nomination either later this week or next week , said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
Feinstein and Schumer , who signaled Friday that they would vote for Mukasey , said their overriding concern was restoring confidence in the Justice Department after two years of politically charged leadership under Alberto R. Gonzales , a longtime friend of President Bush who resigned in mid-September .

“ There is virtually universal agreement , even from those who oppose Judge Mukasey , that he would do a good job in turning the department around , ” Schumer said .
The New York senator said he was reassured after eliciting a promise from Mukasey last week that if Congress were to enact a law declaring waterboarding to be illegal , Bush would have no power to ignore it .
“ From a Bush nominee , this is no small commitment , ” he said .
Mukasey had taken the position that the technique was “ repugnant ” but that he did not have enough information to offer a legal opinion about it .
Feinstein noted that Bush had said that if Mukasey was not confirmed , he would not make another nomination , which would force the Justice Department to be led by an acting attorney general for the rest of his presidency .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t believe a leaderless department is in the best interests of the American people , ” she said , adding that apart from the waterboarding dispute , Mukasey had demonstrated a nonpartisan approach to the Justice Department .
“ I do n’t believe that Judge Mukasey should be denied confirmation for failing to provide an absolute answer on this one subject , ” Feinstein said .
Instead , she said , Congress should address the interrogation issue through legislation .
“ It is very easy to simply say , ‘ Waterboarding is prohibited , ’ ” she said .
But other Democrats on the panel , including chairman Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont , belittled the pledge that Schumer had won from Mukasey .
Among other concerns , the critics said they feared Bush could veto such legislation , leaving the new attorney general with no new law to enforce against the president .
They also said existing laws already clearly prohibited waterboarding .

“ The real damage of this somewhat empty argument is not its futility .
The real harm is it presupposes that we do not already have laws and treaty obligations against waterboarding , ” Leahy said .
“ No senator should abet this administration ’s legalistic obfuscations . . . by agreeing that the laws on the books do not already make waterboarding illegal . ”
After the hearing , Leahy declined to say whether he would support moving ahead with such a bill , calling it “ a red herring ” and the “ biggest cop - out I can imagine . ”
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) asked : “ What is the big mystery here ?
Over and over again , civilian and military tribunals have found waterboarding to be an unacceptable act of torture . ”
The practice , which dates to the Spanish Inquisition and involves water being poured down the mouth and nose of an interrogation subject to simulate drowning , is “ an ancient technique of tyrants , ” Kennedy said .
Advertisement
He called Mukasey ’s promise to enforce a potential congressional ban against waterboarding “ perhaps the most stunning and hollow promise reportedly made by a nominee for attorney general in my 45 years in the Senate . ”
“ We are supposed to find comfort in the representation by a nominee to the highest law enforcement office in the country that he will , in fact , enforce the laws that we pass in the future ?
Can our standards really have sunk so low ? ” he asked .
The panel ’s top Republican , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , said he had spoken with Mukasey on Monday and received the same assurance as Schumer .
“ We urgently need , at this moment , someone to run that department , because right now it ’s being run down , ” Specter said .
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Utah ) , a former committee chairman , contended that “ it politicizes the Justice Department to demand that Judge Mukasey take a politically correct position on waterboarding . ”
Advertisement
“ It politicizes the Justice Department to demand that the incoming attorney general be independent of the Republican president who nominated him , but compliant toward the Democratic Senate that would confirm him , ” he added .
The White House welcomed Tuesday ’s vote .
“ Judge Mukasey has clearly demonstrated that he will be an exceptional attorney general at this critical time , ” Press Secretary Dana Perino said .
Perino said that one of Mukasey ’s first jobs , if he was confirmed , would be to fill several senior leadership positions at the department .
A dozen or so posts are held by acting or interim appointees , including deputy attorney general and senior posts in the civil rights division and in the Office of Legal Counsel , which advises the president on the limits of executive power .

NVIDIA games boss Roy Taylor believes we 're at a point where he does n't believe anyone could possibly justify pirating a PC game .
Speaking exclusively to Eurogamer , Taylor said it was " really unfair " to be stealing from and effectively killing the developers trying to keep the PC market alive .
" I think that we 've arrived at a point now where I do n't know how anyone could ever possibly justify pirating a game .
I just do n't know how anyone could consider that a cool thing to do - it 's not .
It sucks , " Roy Taylor told Eurogamer .
" One of the things that I find frustrating is that PC gamers tend to be very passionate , and they love the people that make great PC games .
If you ask any PC gamer what they think of John Carmack , they 'll say he 's a hero .
What do they think of Tim Sweeney ?
He 's a hero .
Ken Levine is a hero .
And yet many of them , sadly , will go and steal from them .
I just do n't get that , I really do n't . "
Taylor believes one way to combat this is by ramping up digital authentication , and to offer more post - launch content only available to legitimate , registered owners .
" I think that we 're going to see more digital authentication , and we 're going to see more of an approach that says that PC games are n't products - they 're a service , " added Taylor .
" You 're going to start out with a basic service , which is the game , and then increase the value of that service through patches , mod packs , expansions , maps and so on .
That 's the direction it 's going to go , because the pirates are just killing the developers - and I think it 's really unfair , what they 're doing . "
BioWare recently revealed that Mass Effect PC will require an Internet connection in order to revalidate your CD key online every 10 days .
Roy Taylor 's concerns also follow the recent decision by Crysis developer Crytek to stop making PC - exclusive games because of " huge piracy " problems .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A software malfunction prevented a key piece of equipment on the Cassini spacecraft from recording data as it flew through the plume from a geyser shooting off a moon of Saturn , NASA said late on Thursday .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
NASA called the problem “ an unexplained software hiccup ” that came at a very bad time , preventing Cassini ’s Cosmic Dust Analyzer instrument from collecting data for about two hours as it flew over the surface of the moon Enceladus on Wednesday .
A key objective of the fly - by was to determine the density , size , composition and speed of particles erupting into space from the moon ’s south pole in a dramatic plume .
Bob Mitchell , Cassini program manager , said the problem meant that the instrument did not collect data as the craft flew through the plume -- a process lasting under a minute .
“ When it went through the plume , it was not working properly , ” Mitchell said in a telephone interview , expressing disappointment .
“ We had tested that software very carefully .
We do n’t know why it did n’t work properly . ”
The Cassini spacecraft , studying the giant gaseous planet Saturn and its moons in a joint U.S. - European mission , flew as close as 30 miles over the surface of Enceladus ( pronounced en- SELL - ah - dus ) on Wednesday .
“ During the fly - by , the instrument was switching between two versions of software programs .
The new version was designed to increase the ability to count particle hits by several hundred hits per second , ” NASA said in a statement .
“ The other four fields and particles instruments on the spacecraft , in addition to the ion and neutral mass spectrometer , did capture all of their data , which will complement the overall composition studies and elucidate the unique plume environment of Enceladus , ” NASA said .
The Cassini spacecraft , which first spotted the geysers in 2005 , flew over the moon at 32,000 miles per hour ( 51,500 kph ) in the first of four fly - bys of Enceladus scheduled this year .
One of about 60 moons of Saturn , Enceladus is considered among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system , owing to the geysers that spurt from fractures in the surface at the south pole and spew material about 500 miles into space at about 900 miles per hour ( 1,450 kph ) .
Enceladus , whose diameter is 310 miles , is one of the solar system ’s brightest objects .
Encased in ice , it reflects almost all of the sunlight that strikes it .
Some scientists surmise hot water must exist under the surface to eject these plumes .
The presence of liquid water raises the possibility Enceladus may boast conditions conducive to the development of life , perhaps in the form of microbes .
NASA said images taken by the spacecraft showed that the north polar region is much older and more pockmarked with craters of various sizes than much of the southern hemisphere , in particular the south pole .
The images show craters that were caused by impacts of objects onto the moon ’s icy surface in varying stages of alteration by tectonic activity and probably from past heating from below the surface , NASA said .
Enceladus is one of Saturn ’s innermost moons .
The eruptions from its geysers seem to be continuous , generating an enormous halo of fine ice around the moon and supplying material to one of Saturn ’s famed rings .
MGMbill.org is again calling on Congress and state lawmakers to enact legislation that would require men to be eighteen years old before undergoing circumcision .
Yesterday , more than 2,500 elected federal and state officials received proposed bills via email , fax , and mail from the group 's state offices as part of an ongoing effort to make circumcision laws gender neutral .
" The legislation that we are proposing would give boys the same protection from genital cutting that girls have enjoyed since 1997 , " said Matthew Hess , the group 's president .
" Circumcision removes erogenous tissue in both sexes and results in a measurable loss of sexual feeling .
It is a traumatic and disfiguring surgery that should not be performed on children unless there is a clear , compelling , and immediate medical need - period . "
Genital cutting of girls has been prohibited in the U.S. since 1997 when the Female Genital Mutilation
Act took effect , requiring women to be eighteen years old before consenting to any type of genital surgery .
The law has been credited with helping to keep forced female circumcision from spreading to the U.S. from Africa and the Middle East , where it is much more common .
Boys were not included in the law , however , and as a result circumcision is still performed on nearly 60 % of U.S. newborn males by physicians , religious practitioners , or family members .
The practice is undergoing renewed legal scrutiny now that a handful of physicians and health officials are calling for mass circumcision to control the spread of AIDS in Africa .
South Africa 's Parliament stepped in and passed the Children 's Act , which took effect in July and gives significant legal protection to boys under the age of sixteen from being forcefully circumcised .
A month later , the Tasmanian Children 's Commissioner in Australia urged the state government to ban medically unnecessary circumcision of boys , calling it an abuse of human rights .
The Australian Medical Association has generally backed the Commissioner 's position .
A Frankfurt , Germany , regional appeals court pushed circumcision further into the legal gray area when it found that the circumcision of an 11 - year - old Muslim boy without his approval was an unlawful personal injury .
And in November , the Oregon Supreme Court heard a case filed by the mother of a 12 - year - old boy trying to protect him from being circumcised by his father for religious reasons ( the court 's decision is pending ) .
" I feel strongly that boys have the same legal rights as girls to grow up with their genital organs left intact , " said Michelle Richardson , director of MGMbill.org 's
Texas state office .
" If a man wants to undergo circumcision when he becomes an adult , then that option will always be there for him .
But the decision should be his to make , and his alone .
Circumcision is not medically necessary , and it can have far reaching sexual and emotional side effects .
It should not be forced onto anyone , and that includes children . "
Ron Low , director of MGMbill.org 's Illinois state office in Northbrook , is all too familiar with those side effects .
" I hear from men all around the country about the damage caused by circumcision , " said Low , who owns and operates TLCTugger.com , a foreskin restoration device manufacturer .
" They write to complain about loss of sensitivity , about pain during sex , and about how angry they are that a part of their body was taken from them without their consent .
Although some of the damage from circumcision can eventually be reversed through non-surgical foreskin restoration , even the best restoration will not make the thousands of specialized nerve endings grow back .
Those are gone forever . "
State legislatures that received MGM Bill proposals yesterday included California , Florida , Illinois , Iowa , Louisiana , Maryland , New York , Ohio , Texas , Utah , Vermont , Virginia , and Washington .
A federal version was also submitted to President Bush and all members of the U.S. Congress .

More often than not , the question arises on OSNews why certain projects or pieces of abandonware are n’t released as open source software .
Supposedly , this would speed up development , facilitate the growth of a community , all that jazz associated with open source development .
Here are four projects I ’d like to see released under a MIT license .
4 .
BeOS
Many who read OSNews regularly probably know that both Eugenia and I have a special place in our hearts for the BeOS .
We loved it because it was all - new , fresh , and came with a feature set that other operating systems could only dream of – and a whole set of features that shined due to their absence .
Sadly , as we all know , Be , Inc. died due to a combination of business blunders and market circumstances , leaving us BeOS fans in the cold .
The BeOS withered away into irrelevance – only open sourcing BeOS could drag it out of it .
So , why is n’t the BeOS number one ?
Because of Haiku .
The project is making massive strides forward , and the first alpha release creeps ever closer .
Releasing the BeOS source code under a MIT license wo n’t be nearly as useful as it would ’ve been 5 years ago , but might still help the Haiku project .
3. SkyOS
SkyOS is a massive undertaking , especially taking into account it is mostly written by one man : Robert Szeleney .
It started out as a bootloader , but moved away from its roots , turning into an actual operating system , and as the years passed by , the project got ever more ambitious .
I ’ve personally dealt with the 2.x , 3.x , and 4.x branches , as well as the current test releases , and the progress made is just staggering .
Still , the project appears to be stuck in a perpetual state of ‘ testing ’ .
This is of course the team ’s prerogative , but it does negatively affect the perception of the project among operating system enthusiasts .
While the discussion surrounding SkyOS and open source has always evoked strong emotions , there are , of course , undeniable positive aspects to such a move .
I used be a strong supporter of the closed source nature of SkyOS , but in recent years my position swung to the other side due to an apparent lack of focus and the absence of a release .
SkyOS is a great project , with an enthusiastic community , but I think it could be even better .
2. QNX
Just like the BeOS , QNX has a special place in my heart .
I used this operating system extensively , and always appreciated how well - structured , stable , clean , and elegant it was .
Sadly , QNX Software Systems did n’t care about the three men and a cow who ran QNX as their desktop operating system , and did whatever they thought made business sense : focus on where the money is .
It meant the end of the already fragile desktop movement around the QNX operating system .
In September 2007 , QSS “ opened ” the source code behind QNX , but the construction around it is rather messy and is not truly open .
As a result , it does not appear as if the desktop movement around QNX is gaining steam again .
Which is a sad thing , as there is so much potential in QNX .
1. AmigaOS4
AmigaOS4 – the untouchable operating system .
It is done , it is out there , but in order to run it you either need to buy some classic Amiga with an upgrade board , or buy a modern AmigaOne – the latter might prove to be rather problematic since only three were built , and those who bought those three cling on to them for dear life .
In any case , for mere mortals , running AmigaOS4 is nearly impossible .
This is because the AmigaOS is clinging onto an architecture that is increasingly difficult to produce or buy desktop machines for .
The PowerPC architecture is quite alive , but not where it matters for the AmigaOS : the desktop ( or laptop ) market .
The end result is that the AmigaOS is probably the most - praised operating system no one can actually run .
Nobody is making any true profits off AmigaOS4 .
It needs to be open sourced so that the enthusiast community can do what every other sensible company would have already done ages ago : port AmigaOS4 to the x86 architecture .
“ Just smell some roses already , ” Rube told Georgia .
I would like to say the same to the companies behind the AmigaOS : stop suing each other , and allow the world to enjoy your once revolutionary operating system .
The MIT license is waiting for you .
What are your picks ?
Pretty soon , cops wo n’t just be packing stun guns .
They ’ll be carrying electrically - charged riot shields , zapping the unruly without unholstering their weapons .
That is , if the folks at Taser International have their way .
The company just introduced the " Taser Shield
Conversion Kit featuring the Taser Repel Laminate Film Technology . "
The kit " features a peel and stick perforated [ f ] ilm , power supply and necessary conversion equipment .
This laminate becomes electrified providing a powerful deterrent to protect officers and keep suspects or rioters at bay . "
What could possibly go wrong ?
Taser is demoing all kinds of gear this week — from shock - inducing shotgun rounds to " area denial " zappers that can fry groups of people at once .
It ’s all part of the Office of Law Enforcement Technology Commercialization ’s Mock Prison Riot , a showcase for new police and correctional tech , held annually at on the grounds of the former West Virginia Penitentiary in Moundsville .
( David Axe covered the so - called " Rage in the Cage " for DANGER ROOM last year . )
The peel - and - stick zapping film will be available towards the end of the year , the company says .
Our buddy Lew Page , over at El Reg , wonders , " Whatever ’s next ?
Electrified body - armour suits ?
Gauntlets ?
Truly , the day of the electric cop would seem to be upon us . "
And we can think of lots of other things one might do with this sort of
Taser - on - a - roll technology .
Troublesome dogs or drunks relieving themselves against your wall ?
People keep touching your car ?
Borrowing your stuff ?
Cover it in peel - and - stick zappercoat ( with a car - key - style remote disarm as required ) , plug it in and watch the fun ( and lawsuits )
begin .

なんて嫌すぐ る * 1 。
それと、複数のカテゴリをいっぺんにsetlocale(3) に指定する場合も
やりかたは実装によってバラバラです、いくつか確認してみましょ。
Solarisの場合
$ cat > hoge .c #include < locale.h > # include < stdio.h > # if defined ( _WIN32 ) # define JPLOCALE " Japanese_Japan.932 " # elif defined ( __linux__ ) # define JPLOCALE " ja_JP.EUC-JP " #else # define JPLOCALE " ja_JP.eucJP " #endif main ( void ) { setlocale ( LC_ALL , " C " ) ; setlocale ( LC_CTYPE , JPLOCALE ) ; printf ( " %s
" , setlocale ( LC_ALL , NULL ) ) ; } ^D $ make hoge cc -o hoge hoge .c $ ./hoge /ja_JP.eucJP/C/C/C/C/C
各カテゴリをスラッシュ区切りで表示します(順序はLC_*の定数値の小さい方から ) 。
なのですが、 " / " ではじまる場合はpathnameと解釈するちゅう仕様に反してる気が。
つかそもそもスラッシュ区切りだと、LC_ALLの場合pathnameが使えなくなりますな。
/usr/local/share/locale/ww_WW.wwwWW/LC_COLLATE;/usr/local/share/locale/ww_WW.wwwWW/LC_CTYPE ;...
とか、せめて;とか:なんかにしとけばよかったのに。
glibc2の場合は
$ ./hoge LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.EUC-JP;LC_NUMERIC=C
;...
となります、これはこれでウザい( 注：単に個人差です ) 。
われらがNetBSDは↓になってます、FreeBSDが4.4BSD runeを拡張したコードが元ネタ。
$ ./hoge C/ja_JP.eucJP/C/C/C/C
Solarisと似てますが、先頭が " /" ではじまる場合はpathnameと解釈するPOSIX仕様とはいちお整合性あります。
まあLC_ALLの場合pathname使えないのはSolarisと一緒です(汗 ) 。
んで最後、MSVCはglibc2と一緒っすね。
C:\> hoge.exe LC_COLLATE=C;LC_CTYPE=Japanese_Japan.932 ;...
んで気づいてしまったのだけど これ、将来的にカテゴリを追加する( ISO / IEC TR 14652にはある )
場合を考えると、カテゴリが足りない場合エラーになる今のNetBSD setlocale( 3 ) の
実装では glibc2のLC_*_MASK問題と同様に、やっぱりバイナリの後方互換性失われるのよなぁ。
仕様にopaqueとは書かれてないので、移植性を諦めさえすれば
ハードコードすることは別に禁じられてないし…うーむ頭痛い。
どーせ互換性無くなるならglibc2/MSVC風の方がキモイけどリーズナブル。
この問題の別解とし て
setlocale ( LC_ALL , " ja_JP.eucJP " ) ;
として、LC_ALLを指定した場合は全部同じロケールをセットすること以外は
禁止してしまえばいいようにも思えるのだけど
char * tmp , *s ; setlocale ( LC_ALL , " C " ) ; setlocale ( LC_CTYPE , " ja_JP.eucJP " ) ; ... tmp = setlocale( LC_ALL , NULL ) ; s = strdup ( tmp ) ; /* save current locale */ ... setlocale( LC_ALL , s ) ; /* restore previous locale */ free(s ) ;
というcurrent localeのsave/restoreを行うコードが動作しなくなっちまうよな。
まあアプリ側はそもそも この通り
そもそも、 / で区切る指定ができるということを
POSIX その他は 全く規定していないですし、そういうことをやりたい人は LC_xxx で 明示的に指定するべきでしょう 。
なのよな 。
つーわけでパラノイアなアプリ実装者は、とことん安全側に倒して
char * tmp , * collate , * ctype , ... ; setlocale ( LC_ALL , " C " ) ; setlocale ( LC_CTYPE , " ja_JP.eucJP " ) ; ... tmp = setlocale( LC_COLLATE , NULL ) ; collate = strdup ( tmp ) ; /* save current LC_COLLATE */ tmp = setlocale( LC_CTYPE , NULL ) ; ctype = strdup ( tmp ) ; /* save current LC_CTYPE */ ... setlocale( LC_COLLATE , collate ) ; /* restore previous LC_COLLATE */ setlocale( LC_CTYPE , ctype ) ; /* restore previous LC_CTYPE */ free( collate ) ; free ( ctype ) ; ...
とした方がいいかもしれない、save/restore目的にはLC_ALLは使うなと。

The rest of the server world can play with their piddling 2 - 3GHz chips .
IBM , meanwhile , is prepared to deal in the 5GHz realm .
The hardware maker has unveiled a Power6 - based version of its highest - end Unix server - the Power 595 .
The box runs on 32 dual - core 5GHz Power6 processors , making it a true performance beast .
This big box completes a protracted roll out of the Power6 chip across IBM 's Unix server line .
Along with the big daddy , IBM revealed a new water - cooled version of the Power 575 server dubbed the Hydro - Cluster .
In addition , it refreshed the existing midrange Power 570 server .
IBM 's top Power executives showed off the fresh gear during a customer and press event here in San Francisco .
They wheeled out three Power customers who were thrilled to be part of IBM's Unix experience .
We guess that a disgruntled Power user or two could not be located on short notice to provide balance .
The Power 595 ships in a massive cabinet that looks just like that of its predecessors , except IBM has added a few green touches to the case .
This green reflects the environmentally friendly nature of IBM 's hulking metal tower , we 're told .
The Power 595 , available on May 6 , relies on a series of four - socket " books " or boards .
You can fill a system with between one and eight boards , using both 4.2GHz and 5.0GHz chips .
This monster can hold up to 4TB of DDR2 memory .
You 'll find the rest of the specifications here where IBM details the various options with its I /O drawers .
Usually , IBM will hit customers with a massive TPC benchmark score when it rolls out a new 595 - class system - just to let HP know how much it cares .
Apparently , the company is saving that gem for a later date , opting instead just to show how the Power 595 wallops HP 's Itanium gear and Sun's SPARC systems on SAP and SPEC benchmarks .
We 're told that IBM 's new system beats out the rivals by 2 x to 3x .
We thought it rather sporting of IBM to include Sun 's gear in the benchmarks .
The Power 575 is a different type of high - end creature with IBM characterizing the system as a supercomputing machine .
As mentioned , IBM has layered water - filled coils over each of the boards in the 575 , allowing it to create a more dense design .
Customers can fit up to 14 2U boards in the huge 575 case with 16 4.7GHz dual - core chips per board .
You 'll also manage to outfit each board with up to 256GB of memory .
The rest of the rather complex specifications are here .
According to IBM , the water - cooling can reduce typical data center energy consumption by 40 per cent when compared to air cooled 575s .
In addition , the refreshed box offers up 5 x the performance of older 575 systems .
IBM has benchmarked a single 575 board at 600 GFlops .
The system will ship in May , running AIX or Linux .
The refreshed 570 still runs on 3.5 - 4.7GHz versions of Power6 , just as it has done since last year .
Now , however , customers can tap a " hot node " feature that lets them add additional systems to an already running box for extra horsepower and storage .
IBM has shipped 8,000 of the systems to date . ®

- Fascinating facts and useful trivia factoids about people , products and places
After decades of the major medias refusal to link the word working  with class ,  the print pages and airwaves are now alive with talk about the conditions , aspirations and views of working people .
Journalists , who only a few weeks ago would have scoffed at the mere mention of there being a working class .  are now throwing the term around with abandon .
The problem is that it being employed to only cover part of that class ; African American , Latino , Asian and Native American working people are somehow being left out of the demographic equation .
Up until quite recently there was only the middle class .
The term always defied precise definition .
In contemporary U.S. mass media parlance it has come to be defined by income .
That is , people - no matter what they do nine - to - five - who make too little money to be rich and too much to be poor .
On the other hand , traditionally and more logically the working class is defined as being made up of people employed by someone else  usually the rich , but sometimes the government  making refrigerators , waiting tables or data processing .
In it are people of all races and creeds .
However , as this years presidential campaign got rolling , middle class began to give way to blue collar as the nom - de - choice for describing working people .
But that didnt last long .
Soon the group whose votes the candidates were targeting became not just the working class , but the white working class . 
There is method to this madness .
The experts may argue over just how bad the economic situation is but there is no question we are in the middle of a downturn , and a lot of people are feeling insecure about the future , or are already feeling the pain of unemployment and a rising cost of living .
Never mind that  as usual  African American and other non-white ethnic groups are experiencing the negative effects disproportionately .
We are being told that economic issues are the concern of white people .
Black people do not vote according to their economic interests but on racial identity and , conversely , white people vote their interests and not their racial identity  or so this nonsense goes .
If you want to see how stupid ( and devious ) all this is , consider the words of former Bush Administration political strategist Karl Rove :  The primary has created a deep fissure in Democratic ranks : blue collar , less affluent , less educated voters versus the white wine crowd of academics and upscale professionals ( along with blacks and young people ) ,  he wrote in the Wall Street Journal last week .
African American voters here become a throwaway category , not part of the working class .
This despite the fact that they are overwhelmingly working class and make up nearly a third of the Democratic Party .
 MSNBC 's Chris Matthews , for example , differentiated between regular people  and black people ,  wrote columnist David Sirota wrote last week .
 Pundits refer separately to the working class and to African Americans - as if they are mutually exclusive . 
" I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on , " presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told USA Today last week , going on to quote an Associated Press article that showed how Sen.
Barack Obama 's support among " working , hard - working Americans , white Americans , is weakening again , and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me . "
That was not a poor choice of words .
It was part of the effort to make the racial equation the only important one in the primary campaign - and Clinton the Democrats logical choice for the nomination .
Then theres Clinton booster Paul Begala warning that the Democratic Party can't win with just " eggheads and African - Americans . "
And New York Times columnist Paul Krugman - putting it a tiny bit more delicately - describing Obamas deep but narrow base as composed of African Americans and highly educated whites . 
( Lord knows how you define highly educated  here or what happened to college educated African Americans of whom there are millions . )
Then theres rightwing luminary Pat Buchanan chiming in that ,  What Hillary and Begala are saying is politically incorrect , but it is also patently true and then going on to rap about  Hillary Democrats  who are white , working - and middle - class , Catholic , small - town , rural , unionized , middle - age and seniors , and surviving on less than $ 50,000 a year . 
Actually , MSNBC pundit Buchanan ( who by the way recently penned a piece in Human Events called  The Way the World Ends ,  in which , citing world fertility rates , he concluded that  God has another end in store for us  and rued that  The Caucasian race is going the way of the Mohicans by the year 2060 ) got most of that wrong .
He , Rove and some other commentators want us to think that young voters are classless .
They overlook the fact that in Indiana , Obama was the favorite among all voters between the ages of 17 and 45 and 47 percent of those between 45 and 60 .
Yea , some of them are in school , but most , like their parents , work somewhere .
In North Carolina he got the most votes in the 17 through 60 year - old category .
In North Carolina , Obama got a larger percentage of votes from members of families earning less that $ 50,000 a year than those earning more than that amount .
The reaction to Hillarys statement in the blogosphere was hot .
 OK , I think Ive got it ,  Tom wrote in the New York Times space .
 White = hard working , African American , Latino , Asian , Native American , others = not hard working .
Thanks for clearing that up , Hillary .
The non-use of and between hard working Americans  and white Americans is telling . 
 When Clinton says working , hard - working Americans  she tries very hard not to use the term working class ,  wrote Adam .
She almost slipped but caught herself .
What it says is , we still have a class system in America , and we need to change that .
Obama is the solution and Obama will win the general election handily . 
On May 8 , M.S. Bellows , Jr. writing on the The Huffington Post described a May 7 telephone press conference the previous day , called by Clinton Communications Director Howard Wolfson , wherein the Clinton campaign firmly reiterated its intention to keep seeking the Democratic Presidential nomination , spinning both her striking loss in North Carolina and her slender win in Indiana as positive developments - while also appearing to admit that she is not going to win a majority of elected delegates even if Michigan and Florida 's delegations are counted - and parsing primary results in starkly racial terms that are likely to exacerbate the tensions of the contest and her increasingly significant troubles reaching out to minority voters . 
 At points , the Clinton representatives ' demographic parsing bordered on surreal ,  observed Bellows .
 Wolfson seemed to imply that gasoline prices are primarily a white issue , suggesting that Clinton 's proposal for a gas tax holiday  had helped her with white voters and promising that she would continue urging that proposal on the stump .
In response to a pair of questions about whether African Americans would support Clinton in the general election , Wolfson repeatedly referred to Obama 's passionate supporters ,  seeming to conflate the two . 
All this will feed the speculation that s already out there that there are some in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party who care far less about who wins in November than who captures the party nomination and for whom its anybody but Obama .
If they keep dissing black voters they could get their way .
There are black , white and brown members of the working class but there is no white working class .
The term has been trotted out in an effort to portray African Americans as something apart from the class to which most of them belong .
Yes , African Americans know that racism is always a factor in the politics of our country .
The last few weeks have made that abundantly clear despite Obamas attempt to have it otherwise .
But I have some news for Rove , Begala and the others .
Black working people also know a lot about what their interests are and what side of the bread their butter is on .
The price of gasoline is an issue for them as is the home mortgage crisis , the awful state of the educational system , the country deteriorating physical infrastructure , unemployment , healthcare and that ghastly war in Iraq .
The effort to set them apart from other working people is as inaccurate as it is nefarious .
What is needed now is for leaders in the unions , churches and working class communities to come forward and say clearly that this splitting campaign is repulsive , immoral and defeating .
To say that without unity among the social forces some people are trying to slice and dice to serve their own ambitions , we will never have a progressive majority .
Lake of filth
The water is bright green and smells putrid .
The lake is fed by a mixture of raw sewage and rainwater that filters through the rubbish , picking up chemicals and bacteria on the way .
On the rubbish tip that surrounds it children scavenge for things they can recycle like metal , bottles or jars .
Some duck to the bottom to get rubbish others cannot reach .
After listening to futurist Ray Kurzweil speak , one is left less with concrete impressions than a general sensibility , one that 's difficult to articulate but reinforced by certain words that he uses again and again : expansion , doubling and – perhaps most significantly – predictable .
It 's a bit like being lectured by a salesman or an evangelist .
And I think there nugget of truth to the latter characterization .
At the beginning of his talk yesterday at the World Science Festival , he mentioned intelligent design :
" A more sophisticated take , " he said , " is that the laws of physics are a form of intelligent design .
Of course , the designer might be an adolescent in some other universe , and our universe is just a science fair . "
Not that Kurzweil necessarily believes this , or even that it would matter if he did .
His accomplishmentsare many , and he probably forgets more before breakfast than I figure out in a week .
But something about Kurzweil 's certainty brings out the contrarian in me , or at least the skeptic .
Of course , my inner skeptic makes plenty of mistakes – so take all this with as many grains of salt as you 'd like .
Kurzweil 's talk recapitulated the narrative for which he 's known : the steady growth of computing power and sheer reality - describing data will eventually give scientists an unprecedented understanding of biological systems , including the human body , and the ability to hack it in ways that may ultimately defy death .
This process follows an exponential growth curve , one that 's seen elsewhere in history , most notably in the progression of life from eukaryotic cells through the Cambrian explosion and finally to us , homo sapiens , who are poised at the point where things are about to shoot straight up .
Kurzweil 's confidence is tremendous .
At one point , neuroscientist V.S .
Ramachandran , who had delivered the talk before his , expressed doubt that we could quickly reverse - engineer what is fundamentally a hacked system , with evolution taking advantage of multiple shortcuts and multifunctionalities and all - purpose jerry rigging .
" God is an hacker , not an engineer – and that 's a problem we 'll have to confront , " he said .
And Kurzweil 's response was simply that it would n't be a problem .
Some of Kurzweil 's predictions I 'm perfectly willing to bet on .
The ascendance of solar energy , for example : solar panel efficiency has been doubling every two years , and Kurzweil says that only seven more doublings are needed before the sun meets humanity 's energy needs .
Likewise , nanotech - based therapies are moving from the lab into early - stage clinical trials , and look quite promising .
But can we jump from these examples , from the exponential curves
Kurzweil assembled to depict various biological and economic and social phenomena , to the Singularity – a point at which our tools are so proficient at making themselves that more - human - intelligences emerge , and change is so accelerated that we can barely make sense of it ?
This seems to require a certain faith .
Faith is often rewarded , but it also tends to have blind spots .
And in Kurzweil 's talk , the blind spot appeared to be the human condition .
At one point he predicted that we would soon be able to inactivate genes responsible for fat storage , which were useful on the savannah but not in an age dietary abundance .
But is this really the best approach ?
Does n't it make more sense to simply eat less , especially when dietary insufficiency is still a reality for billions of people ?
I know this criticism is a bit nit-picky , and does n't address the probability of what he 's saying .
But Kurzweil 's description of humanity 's ascent towards the Singularity implies that it's an essentially good thing – and though the therapies he describes would be wonderful , there 's a certain impersonality to it .
What will the future mean for us , for our relationships to other people , for our hopes and strivings ?
I 'd love to ask Kurzweil .
But in the meantime , I pose the question to you , Wired Science readers : do you think the humans of Kurzweil 's future will be happier than us ?
Note : Some great relevant reading is " Why the future does n't need us " , published in Wired back in 2000 by Bill Joy , co-founder of Sun
Microsystems and Kurzweil compatriot .
Wired also did a Kurzweil Q - and - A last November , and his website is chock full of his writings .
( Kurzweil's
World Science Festival PowerPoint presentation is also supposed to be there , but I can't find it – if you can , please post the link . )
And for fictional treatments of the Singularity , I recommend Isaac Asimov's
" The Last Question " and Accelerando by Charles Stross .
One other thing I 'll say about Kurzweil : the cocktail of vitamins , supplements and nutraceuticals he 's concocted to keep him healthy until the advent of radical longevity - enhancing therapies appears to be working .
He 's 60 years old but looks ten years younger .

It 's no surprise that a woman in a bikini can increase a man 's sexual appetite but research in the Journal of Consumer Research says that men who watched sexy videos or even handled lingerie had more appetite for everything - and it impacted their decisions about soda , candy and even money .
Authors Bram Van den Bergh , Siegfried DeWitte , and Luk Warlop ( KULeuven , Belgium ) found that the desire for immediate rewards increased in men who touched bras , looked at pictures of beautiful women , or watched video clips of young women in bikinis running through a park .
The authors believe the stimuli bring men's minds to the present as opposed to the future .
" The study demonstrates that bikinis cause a shift in time preference : Men live in the here and now when they glance at pictures featuring women in lingerie .
That is , men will choose the immediately available rewards and seek immediate gratification after sex cue exposure . "

Do all straight men respond the same ?
Actually , no .
Some men are highly responsive to rewards while others are not so sensitive , and the more reward - sensitive men are the impatient ones .
" It seems that sexual appetite causes a greater urgency to consume anything rewarding , " the authors suggest .
Thus , the activation of sexual desire appears to spill over into other brain systems involved in reward - seeking behaviors , even the cognitive desire for money .
In fact , doing a task designed to inspire financial satisfaction reduced the bikini - inspired impatience , just as feeling full reduces food cravings .
Men may want to be aware of bikinis ' effects on their bank accounts and waistlines .
" After they touched a bra , men are more likely to be content with a smaller immediate monetary reward , " writes Bram Van den Bergh , one of the study 's authors .
" Prior exposure to sexy stimuli may influence the choice between chocolate cake or fruit for dessert . "

[ darcs - devel ] announcing the darcs 2.0.0 release
Hello darcs users , I am pleased to announce the release of darcs 2.0.0 !
It 's been a long time coming , and hopefully you will be pleased with the result .
Notable new features include ( in no particular order ) : * New ssh- connnection mode that dramatically improves connection times when darcs 2.0.0 is present on the server as well as the client .
* New " hashed " format that improves darcs ' robustness with regard to network or filesystem errors , and also allows for efficient ( and safe ) caching of patch data , greatly improving access times to a repository that you have had previous contact with -- which is the common case of pulling , pushing or sending .
This format allows patches to move back and forth with darcs1 - format repositories , and is the recommended format ( with an old - format mirror ) if you do not wish to require darcs 2.0.0 , but want to benefit from most of its improvements .
* New " darcs - 2 " format , which features improved conflict handling , and also has all the benefits of the hashed format .
Because this format features new and different semantics , it is not possible to interact with darcs 1.x , and care must be taken in switching to this format .
It is the recommended format for new projects ( although we have n't made it the default ) .
*
The -- partial get is now replaced with a - - lazy get when using hashed formats , and in fact if you forget to provide one of these flags on the command line , you can acheive a lazy get simply by hitting control - C after darcs prints a message suggesting you do this .
Lazy repositories are identical to full repositories so long as you have a working network connection and the original repository is accessible , with patches downloaded as they are needed .
When the original repository is no longer accessible , a lazy repository will behave like the old -- partial repositories .
*
We have added support for pipelined http downloading via either libwww or a very recent version of libcurl .
Neither of these is yet the default , but it is recommended that you try one of them if possible , as they greatly improve download times .
*
There is now a configurable global cache , which can help reduce network traffic if you have multiple local copies of the same -- or similar - - remote repositories .
* I 'm sure there are other new features , but this is all that comes to mind at the moment .
BUGS
There are numerous issues with the - - darcs - 2 repository semantics ( see a discussion at http://wiki.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/DarcsTwo).
In general , I believe the status is that anything you could do with darcs 1.x you can do with the darcs - 2 semantics , but the high - level code has n't been updated to take into account the new possibilities opened up by the new semantics .
In particular , patch dependencies are much more complex .
Alas , there has not been enough time ( or sufficient contributors ) to make the code take these complexities into account , and if you 're clever you can reveal bugs .
You have been warned .
Darcs 2.0.0 contains some performance regressions when running with large repositories .
It is possible that these regressions will be sufficient to prevent its effective use in some projects .
If this describes your project -- and the only way to know is to try it -- then I recommend considering either switching to a different revision control system , or helping us to improve darcs .
The former is certainly the easier path .
If I knew how to easily make darcs dramatically faster , I would have done so .
FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR DARCS
The existing model for darcs maintenance has been the use of two branches , a darcs - stable branch for well - tested changes , and a darcs - unstable branch for more experimental work .
Each branch has a separate maintainer , so most patches will be reviewed by two maintainers before making it into a darcs release .
This is quite a nice system .
Unfortunately , it is also a rather labor - intensive process , and due to a lack of contributors , we 've moving to a more streamlined process .
Starting with the darcs 2.0.0 release , there will be just one central branch of darcs and only one maintainer : for now this is me , David Roundy .
Moreover , I will be attempting to act as a much lower - profile maintainer than we 've had previously .
I will not be reading bug reports , reading the darcs - users email list or even the darcs - devel mailing list .
I will only be reviewing patches that are contributed .
I will not write up long user - friendly release announcements like this for future darcs releases .
I will only be reviewing and applying contributed patches .
What does this mean ?
It means that if darcs is to continue to improve , we need new contributors .
If bug reports are to be read , responded to and bugs are to be fixed , we need new contributors .
If darcs is to be made more efficient , we need new contributors .
The new URL for the darcs repository is simply http://darcs.net.
( Yes , this is a lame ending to the email , but I 'm sending it anyhow , because I 'm tired , and I 've got to get this done . )

NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) --
With gasoline prices hitting record levels , it seems everyone has a tip on how to save fuel .
Much of the advice is well - intentioned , but in the end , much of it wo n't lower your gas bill .
Here 's a look at a few misconceptions :
# 1 . Fill your tank in the morning
You may have heard that it 's best to fill your gas tank in the early morning while the fuel is cold .
The theory goes that fluids are more dense at lower temperatures , so a gallon of cold gas actually has more gas molecules than a gallon of warmer gas .
But the temperature of the gasoline as it comes out of the nozzle varies little during the course of the day , according to Consumer Reports , so there 's little , if any , benefit , to getting up early to pump gas .
# 2 . Change your air filter
Maintaining your car is important , but a clean air filter is n't going to save you any gas .
Modern engines have computer sensors that automatically adjust the fuel - air mixture as an increasingly clogged air filter chokes off the engine 's air supply .
While engine power will decrease slightly as the air filter becomes clogged , a lack of performance or an increase in fuel consumption will be negligible , Consumer Reports says .
# 3 . Use premium fuel
With prices already over $ 4.00 a gallon , premium gasoline is a hard sell these days .
But a lot of drivers think because their owners ' manual recommends premium , they 'll get better fuel economy with it .
Really , they may be paying more money for nothing .
Newer cars for which premium is " recommended " - but not " required " - wo n't suffer with regular fuel .
Modern engine technology comes to the rescue again .
When sensors detect regular instead of premium fuel , the system automatically adjusts spark plug timing .
The result is a slight reduction in peak horsepower - really , you 'll never notice - but little or no reduction in fuel economy .
Always check your owner 's manual before putting anything into your car .
And if your car runs badly on regular , by all means , go back to the pricey stuff .
( See editor 's note at bottom )
# 4 . Pump up your tires
Proper tire inflation is important for a number of reasons .
Under - inflated tires are bad for handling and can even cause a crash .
Improper tire inflation also causes tires to wear out faster and to heat up more , which could trigger a dangerous high - speed blow - out .
According to on - the - road driving tests by both Consumer Reports and auto information site Edmunds.com , underinflated tires reduce fuel economy , so proper inflation is key .
But you should never over - inflate your tires .
They 'll get you slightly better fuel economy because there will be less tread touching the road , reducing friction .
But that means less grip for braking and turning .
The added risk of a crash is n't worth the extra mile a gallon you might gain .
# 5 . To A/C or not A /
C
There 's no question air - conditioning makes extra work for the engine , increasing fuel use .
But car air conditioners are much more efficient today than they used to be .
In around - town driving , using the A/C will drop fuel economy by about a mile a gallon .
Meanwhile , driving at higher speeds with the windows down greatly increases aerodynamic drag .
As speed increases , drag becomes more of an issue , making A/C use the more efficient choice at high speeds .
At most speeds and in most vehicles , A/C use drains slightly more fuel than driving with the windows down , contends David Champion , head of auto testing for Consumer Reports .
" My final take on is that it 's very close , " says Phil Reed , consumer advice editor for Edmunds.com .
" It 's hard to measure the difference and every vehicle is different . "
The best choice - if temperature and humidity allow - is to keep the windows rolled up and to turn the A/C compressor off .
You can keep the fans running to blow in air from the outside , but your car will be as aerodynamic as possible while still letting you breathe .
You will save gas , but the fuel economy improvement will be slight .
# 6 . Bolt -ons and pour-ins
Before you buy a device that 's supposed to make your car more fuel - efficient or pour in an allegedly gas - saving additive , ask yourself this :
Do n't you think oil and car companies are n't doing everything they can to beat their competitors ?
If BP ( BP ) could add something to its gasoline that made cars go farther on a gallon , cars would be lining up at the company 's pumps .
Sure , people would burn their fuel - saving BP gas more slowly , but then they 'd drive right past rivals ' gas stations to come back to BP for more .
BP stations could even charge more for their gas and still sell tons of the stuff .
So if there really was an additive that made gas burn up more slowly , it would n't be sold over the Internet one bottle at a time .
Likewise , car companies are already spending big bucks to increase fuel mileage .
If General Motors could make its cars go significantly farther on a gallon simply by putting a device into the fuel line , do n't think for a second it would n't be doing that .
GM 's car sales would go through the roof .
" There are a number of these gas - saving devices that are generally useless , " says Champion .
But drivers who try them will swear they work .
In reality , it 's probably an automotive placebo effect , says Reed .
Buy one of these devices or additives , and you 're like to pay extreme attention to your fuel economy and how you drive .
Of course it can't hurt to keep a close eye on your driving habits -- and what kind of car you drive .
In the end , that can make the most difference in saving gas .
Gas prices have climbed to record levels .

Report Details Complaints Over Interrogations
By ERIC LICHTBLAU and SCOTT SHANE
May 21 , 2008
Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company
WASHINGTON – F.B.I. agents complained repeatedly , beginning in 2002 , about the harsh interrogation tactics that military and C.I.A. interrogators were using in questioning terrorism suspects , like making them do dog tricks and parade in the nude in front of female soldiers , but their complaints appear to have had little effect , according to an exhaustive report released Tuesday by the Justice Department ’s inspector general .
The report describes major and repeated clashes between F.B.I. agents and their counterparts over the rough methods being used on detainees in GuantÃ¡namo Bay , Afghanistan and Iraq – some of which , according to the inspector general , may have violated the Defense Department ’s own policies at the time .
It also provides new insight into the intense debates at senior levels of the Justice Department , the Defense Department and the National Security Council over what should and should not be allowed – a debate in which the Defense Department prevailed .
The inspector general found that in a few instances , F.B.I. agents participated in interrogations using pressure tactics that would not have been permitted inside the United States .
But the “ vast majority ”  of agents followed the bureau ’s legal guidelines and “ separated themselves ”  from harsh treatment .
For instance , F.B.I. agents expressed “ strong concerns ”  about the abusive treatment by the C.I.A. in 2002 of Abu Zubaydah , a senior Al Qaeda figure , leading to tense discussions between senior officials at the two agencies over how such important prisoners should be handled .
Still , the bureau “ had not provided sufficient guidance to its agents on how to respond when confronted with military interrogators who used interrogation techniques that were not permitted by the F.B.I. , ”  and that fueled confusion and dissension , the report said .
“ In sum , while our report concluded that the F.B.I. could have provided clearer guidance earlier , and while the F.B.I. and DoJ could have pressed harder for resolution of F.B.I. concerns about detainee treatment , we believe the F.B.I. should be credited for its conduct and professionalism in detainee interrogations in the military zones in Afghanistan , ”  in Iraq and at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , the report said .
DoJ refers to the Justice Department , the bureau ’s parent agency .
Jameel Jaffer , who tracks detainee issues for the American Civil Liberties Union , took a more critical stance .
“ The report confirms that senior F.B.I. officials knew as early as 2002 that other agencies were using abusive interrogation methods , ”  Mr. Jaffer said .
“ The report shows unequivocally , however , that the F.B.I. ’s leadership failed to act aggressively to end the abuse . ” 
He said the report documents “ a failure of leadership ”  at the bureau , and “ only underscores the pressing need for an independent and comprehensive investigation of prisoner abuse . ” 
The report said that several senior Justice Department Criminal Division officials raised concerns with the National Security Council in 2003 about the military ’s treatment of detainees , but saw no changes as a result of their complaints .
John Ashcroft , the former attorney general , declined to be interviewed by the inspector general ’s office of the department he had headed , an unusual refusal and one that hampered investigators ’ attempts to learn of discussions inside the council , the report said .
A Pentagon spokesman had no immediate comment on the report .
The inspector general ’s office started its investigation in late 2004 , following widespread public attention to the question of detainee treatment spurred by graphic photographs of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
The American Civil Liberties Union , through a lawsuit , also unearthed numerous internal e-mail messages from the bureau about agents ’ complaints of rough interrogation tactics at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , which proved central in the Justice Department ’s review .
The investigation examined about a half - million documents and included surveys of 1,000 F.B.I. agents regarding their experiences with interrogation tactics by military and C.I.A. interrogators , as well as interviews with hundreds of other bureau personnel , officials said .
The investigation centered on the accounts of what the agents witnessed in the treatment of prisoners at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , in Iraq and in Afghanistan , and how those complaints were handled .
The Justice Department ’s inspector general does not have jurisdiction over the Pentagon .
The bulk of the report was completed last year , but its public release by the inspector general was bottled up for months because of concerns from the Defense Department about the disclosure of sensitive information centering on interrogation tactics .
The final report from the inspector general , unlike some earlier terrorism investigations , was released with relatively few blacked - out sections .
The bureau stationed agents at GuantÃ¡namo Bay and other military detention sites to assist in the questioning of detainees taken into custody after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , but the rough tactics by military interrogators soon became a major source of friction between the bureau and sister agencies .
Agents complained to superiors beginning in 2002 that the tactics they had seen in use yielded little actual intelligence , prevented them from establishing a rapport with detainees through more traditional means of questioning , and might violate bureau policy or American law .
One bureau memorandum spoke of “ torture techniques ”  used by military interrogators .
Agents described seeing things like inmates handcuffed in a fetal position for up to 24 hours , left to defecate on themselves , intimidated by dogs , made to wear women ’s underwear and subjected to strobe lights and extreme heat and cold .
Ultimately , the bureau ordered its agents not to participate in or remain present when such tactics were used .
But that directive was not formalized until May 2004 , and it governed only the bureau ’s own agents .
Robert S. Mueller III , director of the F.B.I. , told Congress that he was not made aware of his agents ’ concerns until 2004 .
Democrats in Congress have been anxiously awaiting the findings from the inspector general as they seek to push for answers from the Bush administration about how interrogation policies were developed .
Representative Jerrold Nadler , the New York Democrat who leads a House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution and civil right , told reporters on Monday , in advance of the report ’s release , that he sensed a “ a reluctance to confront senior administration officials ”  about interrogation policies from the bureau and elsewhere .
He said the report should help answer key questions about how policies were executed .

John
White ’s trial made two fathers the focus of Suffolk County ’s racial divide .
Philip Burke
What happened at the foot of the driveway at 40 Independence Way that hot August night in 2006 took less than three minutes .
The police later managed to time it precisely , using a surveillance camera that points directly at the street from a house a couple of doors to the north .
The readout on the surveillance tape said that it was 23:06:11 when two cars whizzed by going south , toward the cul - de-sac at the end of the street .
At 23:09:06 , the first car passed back in front of the camera , going north .
A minute later , a second car passed in the same direction .
In the back seat of that second car — a black Mustang Cobra convertible — was a seventeen - year - old boy named Daniel Cicciaro , Jr. , known to his friends as Dano .
He was unconscious and bleeding profusely .
He had been shot through the cheek .
A .32 - calibre bullet was lodged in his head .
Normally , at that time of night , not many cars are seen on Independence Way , a quiet street in a town called Miller Place .
Just east of Port Jefferson , on the North Shore of Long Island , Miller Place is in the part of Suffolk County where the commuters have begun to thin out .
To the east is a large swatch of the county that does n’t seem strongly connected to the huge city in one direction or to the high - priced summer resorts and North Fork wineries in the other .
The house at 40 Independence Way is part of a development , Talmadge Woods , that five or six years ago was a peach orchard ; it ’s now a collection of substantial two - story , four - bedroom houses that the developer started offering in 2003 for about half a million dollars each .
The houses vary in design , but they all have an arched front door topped by the arched glass transom known in the trade as a Palladian window — a way to bring light into the double - height entry hall .
When people are asked to describe the neighborhood , they tend to say “ upper middle class . ”
The homeowner with the surveillance system is an orthodontist .
Miller Place could also be described as overwhelmingly white .
According to a study released a few years ago , Long Island is the single most segregated suburban area in the United States .
The residents of 40 Independence Way — John and Sonia White and their youngest son , Aaron — are African - American and so are their next - door neighbors , but the black population of Miller Place is less than one - half of one per cent .
The Whites , who began married life in Brooklyn in the early seventies , had moved to Miller Place after ten years in North Babylon , which is forty minutes or so closer to the city .
“ You want to raise your family in a safe environment , ” John White , a tall , very thin man in his early fifties , has said , explaining why he was willing to spend three hours a day in his car commuting .
“ The educational standards are higher .
You want to live a comfortable life , which is the American dream . ”
One of the Whites ’ sons is married , with children of his own , and a second is in college in the South .
But Aaron was able to spend his senior year at Miller Place High School , which takes pride in such statistics as how many of its students are in Advanced Placement history courses .
Aaron , an erect young man who is likely to say “ sir ” when addressing one of his elders , graduated in June of 2005 .
He was one of four black students in the class .
In an area where home maintenance is a priority , 40 Independence Way could hold its own .
John
White is a serious gardener — a nurturer of daylilies and clematis , a planter of peel - bark birch trees — and someone who had always been proud , maybe even touchy , about his property .
People who have been neighbors of the Whites tend to use the word “ meticulous ” in describing John White ; so do people who have worked with him .
He has described himself as “ a doer ” — someone too restless to sit around reading a book or watching television .
He says that he ’s fished from Nova Scotia to the Bahamas .
He ’s done a lot of hunting — a pastime he was taught by his grandfather Napoleon
White , whose family ’s migration from Alabama apparently took place after a murderous attack by the Ku Klux Klan .
At the Faith Baptist Church , in Coram , Long Island , John White sang in both the men ’s choir and the mixed Celebration Choir .
A couple of polished - wood tables in the Whites ’ house were made by him .
He ’s a broadly accomplished man , and proud of it .
His wife , who was born in Panama , works as a manager in a department store and has that Caribbean accent which , maybe because it ’s close to the accent of West Indian nurses , conveys both competence and the firm intention to brook no nonsense .
The Whites ’ furniture tastes lean toward Stickley , Audi .
Their sons dress in a style that ’s preppy .
Sitting in his well - appointed family room , John White could be taken for middle management .
But he does n’t have the sort of education or occupation that would seem to go along with the house he lives in .
After graduating from a technical program at Samuel Gompers High School , he worked as an electrician for seven or eight years and then , during a slow time for electricians , he began working in the paving industry .
For the past twenty - five years , he has worked for an asphalt company in Queens , patching the potholes left by utility repair crews .
He is often described as a foreman , which he once was , but he says that , partly because of an aversion to paperwork , he did n’t try to reclaim that job after it evaporated during a reduction in the workforce .
( “ I ’m actually a laborer . ” )
On August 9 , 2006 , a Wednesday , he had , as usual , awakened at three - thirty in the morning for the drive to Queens , spent the day at work , and , after a stop to pick up some bargain peony plants , returned to what he calls his “ dream house ” or his “ castle . ”
He retired early , so that he could do the same thing the next day .
A couple of hours later , according to his testimony , he was awakened by Aaron , who , with a level of terror John White had never heard in his son ’s voice , shouted , “ Dad , these guys are coming here to kill me ! ” Instead , as it turned out , John White killed Daniel Cicciaro , Jr .
There had been a birthday party that evening for Craig Martin , Jr. , a recent Miller Place High School graduate .
Craig lives with his parents and his younger sister , Jennifer , in Sound Beach — a town just to the east that grew into a year - round neighborhood from what had begun as beach lots purchased in the twenties as part of a Daily Mirror circulation - promotion scheme .
The party was mostly in the Martins ’ back yard , where there was an aboveground pool , a lot of cold beer , and a succession of beer - pong games .
This was not the A.P. - history crowd .
Craig was connected to a number of the boys at the party through an interest in cars .
Some of them were members of the Blackout car club , a loose organization of teen - agers who , in good weather , gather in the parking lot of the Stop & Shop mall in Miller Place on Thursday nights for an informal car show — displaying cars whose lights and windows are likely to have been tinted in pursuit of sleekness .
Dano Cicciaro ( pronounced Danno Cicero ) was a regular at Stop & Shop , driving a white Mustang Mach 1 with two black stripes .
Dano had grown up in Selden , a blue - collar town to the south , and finished at Newfield High School there after his family moved in his senior year to one of a half - dozen houses clustered around a cul - de- sac called Old Town Estates , in Port Jefferson Station .
DIGG THIS
In The Revolution : A Manifesto , Ron Paul says he does n’t believe the claim that most people are indifferent about freedom as long as they ’re kept entertained and well fed .
It ’s more a lack of knowledge , he says , that keeps people from embracing the free society .
I ’ve gone back and forth on this , and I ’m inclined to think the truth is somewhere in between .
But I think the cynics , who hold out no hope for the American people at all , are surely wrong .
Case in point : this thread .
This nurse had accidentally left her copy of The Revolution : A Manifesto at her nurses ’ station overnight .
When she arrived the next morning , fearing the book might be lost , she found to her amazement that the overnight nurse had actually read the entire thing .
Not only that , but she had become an instant convert , wanting to spread Ron Paul ’s message to her friends and family , and get extra copies of his book .
This is a person who , just a day earlier , had supported Hillary Clinton on the grounds that she wanted to see a woman in the White House .
Another person in the same discussion thread says that his own father , once a staunch McCain supporter , is now firmly for Ron Paul and withdrawal from Iraq .
Having had a chance to read Dr. Paul ’s positions for himself , he is now convinced that if all Americans could do so , Ron Paul would be president .
And then there ’s my own experience .
I ’ll be frank : like most people , I was n’t intellectually creative enough to break free of the phony choices our political system gives us .
All I knew for sure was that I was n’t a leftist .
Therefore , I lazily concluded , I must be in Rush Limbaugh ’s camp .
Yes , I was once a full - fledged neoconservative , pretty much from the moment I became politically aware until around 1993 .
What jolted me out of it ?
Among other things , I attended Mises University 1993 , put on by the Ludwig von Mises Institute , while a junior at Harvard .
It was far and away the most intellectually exciting experience of my college career .
( Now I ’m on the other side of things , actually lecturing at the Mises University program , and almost envious of the students who are about to be introduced to the intellectual pleasures of the Austrian School for the first time . )
Then there ’s my experience teaching American history and Western civilization to students in New York .
I did n’t propagandize them , since that is n’t appropriate in a college history classroom , but the brighter ones perceived soon enough the chasm separating the late - eighteenth - century America I was describing and the America of today .
From time to time they demanded to know my views on this or that subject , or my political philosophy in general .
My protests that I did not want to politicize the classroom or intimidate students who had views different from my own were brushed aside : we just want to know what you think , man !
Lo and behold , it made sense to them .
And they ’d never heard it before .
I found myself making converts without really trying .
( And no , they were n’t just saying so in order to ingratiate themselves into the professor ’s favor ; most of these testimonies came in the form of emails well after the semester had ended . )
All these experiences , I suspect , are not really so unusual .
Set aside those who ( la The Matrix ) prefer the blue pill and ignorance over the red pill and knowledge .
The fact is , plenty of people want that red pill , even if they do n’t know it yet — as I myself did not , some 15 years ago now .
That pill can take many forms .
I can think of three right away : LewRockwell.com , the Ludwig von Mises Institute , and Ron Paul ’s new book .
But these things can do the work they are intended to do only if we bring them to people ’s attention — friends , family , co-workers , whatever .
You know what to do next .
The Best of Tom Woods
For a number of reasons , including ISP ad campaigns , the US broadband market has developed such that unlimited bandwidth is regarded as a universal right .
With the advent of heavy P2P traffic , demand for music and video , and increased penetration , that " right " has left ISPs in the uncomfortable position of having overpromised their network capacity and scrambling for ways to avoid paying for greater capacity .
Comcast 's varied — and often awkward — attempts to come to terms with P2P usage represent a case study of this scramble , and word has it that the company is trying yet another new strategy : a bandwidth cap with some significant costs for users that exceed it .
Comcast , like many other ISPs , has a usage policy that contains nonspecific warnings against generating excessive Internet traffic , but never defines what excessive is .
Since last year , it has grown increasingly aggressive about cutting down on the bandwidth used by its subscribers .
Tactics started with going after the highest - volume users of its service , and suggesting they needed to pay for higher levels of service .
But the company really grabbed the spotlight once word slipped out that it was throttling P2P traffic , a practice that drew the ire not only of its users but , more significantly , the FCC .
Since then , the company has sent out spasms of mixed messages .
It argued that the FCC had no authority to block their process , but still decided to stop interfering with P2P traffic anyway .
The company also joined in with other ISPs in trying to devise a P2P user 's bill of rights and contemplated the use of P4P software .
But , as Nate Anderson recently detailed , the problem is n't access to sufficient capacity for the ISPs , but that adding that capacity costs money .
Given that reality , the recent move by Time Warner to experiment with charging users for exceeding a well - defined bandwidth cap was almost refreshing in its honesty : no vague terms of service , and an obvious forwarding of the ISPs costs on to its consumers .
By these standards , it appears that Comcast may be ready to experiment with a little honesty , too .
Broadband Reports is quoting an internal Comcast source that suggests the company is considering a bandwidth cap of 250 GB per month , with users that go over the cap being charged $ 15 for every 10 GB in excess .
Comcast spokesman Charlie Douglas confirmed this report , saying , " Comcast is currently evaluating this service and pricing model to ensure we deliver a great online experience to our customers . "
For now , however , he emphasized that no final decisions have been made .
As Eric Bangeman noted in his analysis of Time Warner 's decision , honesty will only get the cable companies so far .
Although they rarely compete with each other , Verizon and other phone companies would be happy to accept their customers , and some wireless broadband technology on the horizon may increase the competition further .
Users may be even more likely to switch service providers if these bandwidth charges , instead of covering the cost of capacity , serve to increase corporate profits .

Choosing knives is one of the most important decisions an avid cook can make .
Knives are among the most used tools in the kitchen , but can also be some of the most mysterious for buyers .
One problem is that price does n't always correlate with quality .
Another is that a knife 's performance " out of the box " may deteriorate rapidly upon frequent use .
Add in unsubstantiated marketing claims , shady salespeople peddling hard - to - recognize brand names , and buying a knife can end up resembling buying a used car .
The good news is that a short list of expert tips can help you get educated in a hurry .
Following those tips will ensure that you get the most appropriate knives for your budget .
These tips can certainly save you a bundle of money but , more importantly , will help you walk away with great knives .
If you 've never wielded a light , razor - sharp Japanese Chef 's knife , you 're in for a real treat .
After I 've laid out these tips , I 'll apply them to a set of price ranges and make specific knife recommendations .
Of course , choosing knives is a personal decision .
You 'll want to consider your style of cooking , how often you cook and the tasks you frequently perform .
But the recommendations should serve as a good starting point -- they 're all great knives and are priced appropriately .
The Great Kitchen Knife Revolution
Before we get started , it 's worth reviewing some kitchen knife history .
Many people are unaware of the great upheaval that the kitchen knife industry has undergone in the last decade .
Needless to say , it has completely changed the landscape for buying cutlery .
The short version of this great story is that the best knives available today were unheard of even ten years ago .
Ten years ago , there were only two names in kitchen knives -- Henckels and Wusthof .
And it had been that way for many years .
Today , those German knife makers are scrambling to keep up with new , superior knives introduced by Japanese knife making companies .
German knives still have their place in the kitchen , do n't get me wrong , but if you 've been stuck using those knives for the last decade , you 'll be pleasantly surprised when you try out a knife from Global , MAC or Shun .

Tips for Saving Money on Kitchen Knives
Some cooks will tell you that you can't buy kitchen knives on a budget .
" You get what you pay for " , they 'll say .
Or " you ca n't get decent quality for under $ 150 " .
I do n't buy it .
Granted , you 're not going to get a full set of quality knives without shelling out some serious dough , but there ARE some great values out there .
And if you 're smart about how you spend your money , those values can be found .
1. Do n't Buy Too Many Knives
One of the first mistakes people make when buying a set of knives is to go out and get the largest set they can .
" Why buy the 14 piece set when you can get the 21 piece set for just $ 75 more ? " they reason .
The answer is simple ...
You 're never going to need all those knives .
If you 're a professional chef who needs the perfect knife for every task , then you 'll certainly need a lot of knives .
But for the rest of us , we can get by with a small number of high - quality knives .
Buying three good quality knives instead of a 14 - piece set with lots of " filler " can save you more than fifty percent .
Of course , you wo n't have as many knives as with the large set .
But your knives will be just as useful for most tasks and will be much higher quality .

Knife Set or à la Carte ?
Many people assume that the best way to buy knives is as part of a set .
And yet , most experts will tell you NOT to buy a knife set , but rather to buy knives one - at - a - time .
That way , you get exactly the knives you want and do n't pay extra for knives you do n't need .
Of course , there are times when a knife set makes sense .

2. Sharpness Matters More Than Price
Many people are happy with the performance of their knives when they first buy them , but then neglect to maintain them over time .
A few years later , they 're left wondering why these knives seem ineffective .
It may seem obvious that kitchen knives need to be sharpened periodically and I 'm sure that most people know this .
And yet , many home chefs do n't know how to do this , do n't want to do it , or just plain forget to do it .
I make a habit of inspecting knives in as many home kitchens as I can and I can reliably say that the blades are too dull in about 90 % of them .
If you do n't know how to maintain knives properly , you might be tempted to discard old knives before their time .
Or , worse yet , you might buy expensive knives in the hope that they will be sharper than an inexpensive set .
Sadly , this is not always the case .
Buying a new set of sharp knives and then keeping them sharp will put you way ahead of the game -- regardless of how much your knives cost .
How to choose sharp knives and keep them that way ?
Check out our kitchen knife sharpening guide .
3. Know Your Steel
The single most important factor in determining the quality of a kitchen knife is not its name brand , its price or whether it was stamped or forged .
It 's the steel used in the blade .
Better quality steel will last longer , can hold a sharper edge for a long time , and will be easier to resharpen .
And yet , other than making vague marketing statements about " high carbon content " , most manufacturers do not advertise the makeup of their steel .
This can lead to a costly mistake for the consumer -- purchasing knives made from inferior steel .
Generic " high - carbon " knives might feel great when they come out of the box , but they 're sure to disappoint down the road .

Recommended Knives
Applying the tips above to a set of different budget tiers yields some real bargains .
Most of the knives on this list are known more for their quality among professional chefs than for their name recognition and corporate marketing budget .
If you 've read this far , it wo n't come as any surprise that each recommendation includes just a small set of essential knives and that each knife is made of high - quality steel , is razor - sharp and can be kept that way .
Of course you do n't need to stick to a single price level -- if you 're buying à la carte as most experts recommend , consider mixing and matching knives from each price level .
You 're likely to save even more money doing that , as you may choose to get a high - end Chef 's knife but other knives from the lower - priced categories .
Where 's Cutco ?
Cutco 's made a name for themselves by showing people just how sharp home cutlery can be .
I applaud them for that , but do n't particularly care for their knives .
In my opinion , the steel 's nothing special and the price is too high .
In short , they do n't fit our three money - saving rules above .
Recommended $ 50 Knives
Cooks Illustrated 's recommendation -- the Forschner 3 - Piece Fibrox set -- is a screaming bargain .
It 's not beautiful and the steel is merely good , but it will out - perform just about any other knife in this price range .
For those looking for more stylish knives , KAI 's Komachi series is another great choice in this range .

$ 150 Knives
In this price range , buying à la carte allows you to consider a top - notch Chef 's knife from the Shun Classic or MAC Professional series , and then supplement with the less - expensive Forschners from our lowest price tier .
If you 're determined to buy matching knives , Messermeister makes a great small set in this price range .
Messermeister is not as well - known as Wusthof and Henckels , but their knives are a much better value .
Their San Moritz Elite Knives are made of high - quality steel and are reasonably - priced .

$ 300 - $ 500 Knives
At this level , you 're no longer making sacrifices .
You 'll find great knives intended for serious amateurs as well as professional chefs .
Shun is the current kitchen knife king .
You can't chop an onion without noticing their great press .
The Shun Seven Piece Classic set epitomizes the three money - saving tips outlined above .
Another option is Global .
Global was the first knife maker to introduce the world to the joys of razor - sharp Japanese steel .
The feel takes a little getting used to but the Global 5 - piece set is priced appropriately .
If you 're buying à la carte , consider the knives from Shun and Global mentioned above , but also check out MAC Professional Knives .
They 're lesser - known and are not typically sold in sets , but they are great performers and are typically less - expensive than both Shun and Global .
$ 1000 Knives
If you 're an aspiring professional or simply want the best knives that money can buy , you 've got a ton of great choices in this range .
Choosing one is really a personal decision , so it 's hard for us to recommend just one .
Look for top - notch Japanese makers such as Hattori , Misono , Blazen , Glestain and Nenox to name a few .
All of these makers produce exceptionally sharp knives with centuries - old knife - making traditions to back them up .
One Knife to Rule Them All ?
If you 've read this far , you may be curious to try out the virtues of Japanese knives without committing to a large purchase .
Choosing a single 8 " Chef 's knife from one of the recommended names above will allow you to test the waters a bit .
Either the Shun Classic or the MAC Professional make a good start to a Japanese - themed set and wo n't break the bank .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Rock ’n ’ Roll legend Elvis Presley did in fact visit Britain , it was revealed on Tuesday , with a secret visit to London accompanied by another rocker .

For more than half a century it was generally accepted the “ King ” only made a fleeting transit visit to Scotland in 1960 -- much to the disappointment of his legion of UK fans .
But theatre producer Bill Kenwright has revealed in a radio interview that Presley , then 23 , managed to go sightseeing in London with Cockney singer Tommy Steele .
The pair ’s trip , understood to have taken place in 1958 , included visits to the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace , Kenwright said .
Presley did not perform .
Kenwright , who has known Steele for decades , inadvertently revealed the secret trip in a pre-recorded Radio 2 interview on Ken Bruce ’s show Tracks Of My Years .
At the time Presley was so popular he needed military guards to control crowds whenever he made a public appearance while Steele was billed as his British equivalent .
Steele , now 71 , from Woking in Surrey , was discreet when asked on Tuesday to confirm the meeting .
“ What actually happened many years ago is something secret and memorable , ” he told the Daily Mail .
“ It was an event shared by two young men sharing the same love of their music and the same thrill of achieving something unimaginable .
“ I swore never to divulge publicly what took place and I regret that it has found some way of ‘ getting into the light ’ .
“ I can only hope he ( Presley ) can forgive me . ”
Kenwright , 62 , said he accidentally revealed the secret .
“ It ’s quite something , is n’t it -- the thought of them wandering around London together , ” he later told the newspaper .
“ But the impression I got was that they never got out of the car .
It was more like , ‘ There ’s Buckingham Palace ... there ’s the Houses of Parliament ’ .
“ Tommy is a very private person who does n’t go into the past .
It ’s only me who makes him talk about it . ”
Elvis ’ only documented visit to Britain was in brief stopover in Ayrshire when his plane landed at Prestwick airport to refuel .
Photographs show that he was accompanied by his soon - to - be wife , teenage sweetheart Priscilla .
“ Magic ” mushrooms really do have a spiritual effect on people , according to the most rigorous look yet at this aspect of the fungus ’s active ingredient .
About one - third of volunteers in the carefully controlled new study had a “ complete ” mystical experience after taking psilocybin , with half of them describing their encounter as the single most spiritually significant experience in their lifetimes .
However , psilocybin use has been associated with side effects such as severe paranoia , nervousness and unwanted flashbacks and so experts warn against experimentation .
“ Once you ’ve started down the path , you might not like where it ends , ” comments Herbert Kleber , a psychiatrist at Columbia University in New York , US .
“ These are powerful agents that are just as likely to do harm as to do good . ”
Psilocybin is found in mushrooms such as the liberty cap ( Psilocybe semilanceata and about 186 other species .
Hippies embraced the compound during the 1960s , after its mind - altering potential was touted by Timothy Leary , then a researcher at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
But as its use grew , US lawmakers took action .
It is now generally illegal to sell or possess psilocybin drugs in the US .

Demonised compound
But Roland Griffiths , of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore , Maryland , US , and his colleagues believe there is a need to revisit the biological effects of psilocybin , which have been virtually ignored by the scientific community for about 40 years .
“ It so traumatised our society that we ’ve demonised this compound , ” he says .
Griffiths ’s team recruited 36 healthy volunteers who had not experimented with the drug before .
They were informed that they would receive a hallucinogen but did not know in which of two or three sessions they would receive it .
Each session was separated by two months .
They either received a substantial dose – about 30 milligrams – of psilocybin or a similar dose of an “ active ” placebo , Ritalin .
The latter has a stimulating effect but is not known as a hallucinogen .
An inactive placebo would be easy to identify by the volunteers when compared to psilocybin , which could bias the experiences they reported .
The researchers used psychological questionnaires and found that 22 of the 36 volunteers had a “ complete ” mystical experience after taking psilocybin – far more than the four who reported this type of experience after taking Ritalin .
More than one - third of the volunteers said that their encounter with psilocybin was the single most spiritually significant experience in their lifetimes – no person given Ritalin said the same .
Experts say the study is the most rigorous study of psilocybin ’s potential to elicit spiritual feelings because it is the first to use an active control .
Spiritual shortcut
However , more than 20 % of the participants described their psilocybin sessions as dominated by negative feelings such as anxiety .
And while psilocybin appears to mimic the brain signalling - chemical serotonin , its precise action on mind function remains elusive .
Griffiths says that in the future psilocybin might have a therapeutic use , perhaps helping people who have just learned they have cancer come to terms with the news .
But he is quick to add that “ the therapeutic application is very speculative ” .
“ My guess is that there will be people saying  You ’re looking for a spiritual shortcut ' ” says Griffiths .
He stresses that the drug is no replacement for the mental health benefits of continuous personal reflection : “ There ’s all the difference in the world between a spiritual experience and a spiritual life . ”

Redundant Advice Don't Smile Too Much , German Shop Assistants Warned

It 's unlikely to become a major health issue though -- German customer service is n't renowned for its friendliness .
Taking Obama at his word
A weird moment of TV , partially captured in the clip above .
Clinton denies she thinks Obama 's a Muslim , but her denial seems something other than ironclad , and the interviewer goes back at her on the question .
There are real danger zones for even hinting this stuff , even leaving yourself open to uncharitable interpretations , more with Obama than with any other politician I can think of .
And expect a lot more of these moments if he 's the nominee .
Here 's the full " 60 Minutes " exchange , in CBS 's version :
“ You do n't believe that Senator Obama 's a Muslim ? ” Kroft asked Sen. Clinton .
“ Of course not .
I mean , that , you know , there is no basis for that .
I take him on the basis of what he says .
And , you know , there is n't any reason to doubt that , ” she replied .
“ You said you 'd take Senator Obama at his word that he 's not …a Muslim .
You do n't believe that he's … , ” Kroft said .
“ No .
No , there is nothing to base that on .
As far as I know , ” she said .
“ It 's just scurrilous … ? ” Kroft inquired .
“ Look , I have been the target of so many ridiculous rumors , that I have a great deal of sympathy for anybody who gets , you know , smeared with the kind of rumors that go on all the time , ” Clinton said .
BOISE , Idaho ( Reuters ) - J.R. Simplot , the billionaire founder of the Boise , Idaho - based agriculture business that bears his name and who helped make French fries a staple of the American diet and waistline , died on Sunday at the age of 99 , officials said .
French fries are served in a file photo .

After pioneering the first commercial frozen French fry in the late 1940s , Simplot eventually became a major supplier of Idaho potatoes to McDonald ’s , Burger King and Wendy’s .
His privately held company , where he was chairman emeritus , reported $ 3.3 billion in sales in 2006 .
An official at the Ada County Coroner ’s office said Simplot died at home on Sunday morning of natural causes .
Born John Richard Simplot in Dubuque , Iowa in 1909 , he left school at the age of 14 to work in the agriculture storage and distribution business .
He started his first produce company in 1929 , and eventually became a major supplier of dehydrated potatoes to the U.S. military during World War II .
In the late 1940s , Simplot ’s researchers began experimenting with frozen potato products .
His company began producing frozen French fries in Idaho in 1946 and the business thrived with the spread of freezers into American homes .
Simplot ’s most well - known business venture began with a handshake .
In 1967 , Simplot and McDonald ’s founder Ray Kroc shook hands and agreed the Simplot Company would provide frozen French fries to the expanding fast - food chain .
The company expanded to several potato processing plants in Idaho , Oregon and Washington , and eventually Australia and China .
It now grows and processes many other vegetables .
The postwar spread of processed American fast food has had a significant impact on the nation ’s health , with the popularity of such food contributing to an obesity epidemic .
The Simplot company also operates a feedlot business , with operations in Idaho and Washington turning out about 400,000 head of cattle per year .
The company owns and operates fertilizer manufacturing plants in Idaho , and a Simplot company called Grower Solutions has about 70 stores selling agricultural products in the West .
In 2001 , the plain - spoken businessman told Esquire Magazine luck had nothing to do with his success .
“ Work honestly and build , build , build .
That ’s all I can tell you , ” he said .
In 1973 Simplot retired from his company , but remained chairman of the board .
He stepped down from that post in 1994 after his children Gay , Don and Scott were named to the board of directors , but retained the title of chairman emeritus .
In 1980 , he provided seed money to a small Boise - based computer chip manufacturer , Micron Technology .
Micron is now one of Idaho ’s largest publicly traded companies .
A well - known figure in Boise , Simplot was often seen driving through town in a Lincoln Town Car with license plates that read “ MR SPUD . ”
In an interview for the company in 1992 , Simplot said he did n’t care how he would be remembered .
“ Oh hell , I do n’t care what they say about me , ” Simplot said .
“ I ’m not a publicity hound . ”
Olympic Gymnast Paul Hamm Injured , Beijing Games Looming
broke a bone in his right hand on Thursday night at the U.S. championships .
He was executing the finishing moves of his parallel bars routine when he jammed his ring finger and broke his right hand .
The XXIX Olympiad begins in Beijing , China on August 8 , 2008 .
An injury this close to competition would appear to put the Olympic gold medalist out of the running .
Not so fast says Hamm , who believes that he can petition for a spot on the U.S. gymnastics team .
He knows he will not be able to qualify for the squad at the upcoming Olympic trials in Philadelphia starting June 19th but if he can show that he is healthy , they will likely grant the petition based upon his stature within the sport .
Hamm was candid in saying :
There 's no guarantees , no matter what .
The only thing I can do at this point is make an attempt , try and see what happens .
I do n't really even know exactly what the game plan is going to be until I talk to the doctors .
It 's going to be a push , but if anybody can do it , I can pull it off . "
Hamm is the only American male gymnast to win a world title ( 2003 ) or Olympic gold ( 2004 ) .
He walked away from the sport for 2½ - years after the Athens Olympics but the elite gymnast has come back with a vengeance and is a favorite to defend his gold metal at Beijing .
Hamm was having an excellent night at the U.S. championship meet .
Despite the injury , Hamm finished the night almost four points ahead of his next competitor .
He had the highest score of the night on pommel horse and high bar , and tied his twin brother Morgan Hamm for best score on floor exercise .
Hamm had this to say about the Thursday night competition :
I felt I was in the best shape of my life at this past competition .
The meet was going really , really well .
I had three skills left to finish in my parallel bars routine , and that 's where the injury comes .
It 's kind of sad and ironic at the same time . "
Doctors confirmed the bone break and displacement with x-rays on Friday .
One option would have him wear a cast .
The better option appears to be surgery which will allow him to start physical therapy and rehab sooner .
He vows to continue exercising to keep his body in top form while his hand is healing .
The U.S. championship finals are Saturday night , May 24 .
He 'll be cheering his brother Morgan , who is coming back from a serious injury of his own .
He pulled a muscle in his chest in October 2007 and is slowly regaining his top form .

( As of March 2020 )
Here ’s how things seem to look one day after the vote in Virginia , Maryland and D.C .
Republicans
If there was ever going to be a chance to stop John McCain , or force a brokered convention , it was here , specifically in Virginia .
For part of the night , it looked like Mike Huckabee might actually pull it off but , as I expected , Northern Virginia came back heavy for McCain and he took the state , and all 63 delegates , by 9 percentage points .
McCain now stands just under 350 delegates short of clinching the nomination , and he ’ll get it by March 4th .
Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul ?
It ’s over , guys .
Democrats
Not only did Barack Obama sweep the Potomac Primary , he did so decisively and , in Virginia , beat Clinton in almost every demographic category .
That would seem to bode well for states like Ohio and Pennsylvania .
More importantly , he ’s ahead in the delegate count and , as Howard Fineman argued last night on MSNBC , there ’s almost no way that Hillary can win based on the pledged delegates alone :
That leaves this nomination up to two things — how the DNC treats Michigan and Florida , and what the superdelegates do .
Questions For The Future
As we head into the third act of this campaign , this seems to be what people will be talking about
How will the DNC handle the fact that Michigan and Florida were stripped of their delegates ?
Will the Democratic superdelegates go against the popular vote
Who ’s in the running for McCain ’s Veep ?
Will there be a big third - party run ?
Plenty to talk about , I would think .

How to Detect Lies
How to Detect Lies
Become a Human Lie Detector ( Part 1 )
Warning : sometimes ignorance is bliss .
After gaining this knowledge , you may be hurt when it is obvious that someone is lying to you .
The following deception detection techniques are used by police , forensic psychologists , security experts and other investigators .
Introduction to Detecting Lies :
This knowledge is also useful for managers , employers , and for anyone to use in everyday situations where telling the truth from a lie can help prevent you from being a victim of fraud / scams and other deceptions .
This is just a basic run down of physical ( body language ) gestures and verbal cues that may indicate someone is being untruthful .
Remember : these signs do n’t indicate someone is lying , just that they are more likely to be lying .
If you got here from somewhere else , be sure to check out our Lie Detection index page for more info including new research in the field of forensic psychology .
Last update : April 10th , 2013 .
Signs of Deception :
Body Language of Lies :
• Physical expression will be limited and stiff , with few arm and hand movements .
Hand , arm and leg movement are toward their own body the liar takes up less space .
• A person who is lying to you will avoid making eye contact .
• Hands touching their face , throat & mouth .
Touching or scratching the nose or behind their ear .
Not likely to touch his chest / heart with an open hand .
Emotional Gestures & Contradiction
• Timing and duration of emotional gestures and emotions are off a normal pace .
The display of emotion is delayed , stays longer it would naturally , then stops suddenly .
• Timing is off between emotions gestures / expressions and words .
Example : Someone says “ I love it ! ” when receiving a gift , and then smile after making that statement , rather then at the same time the statement is made .
• Gestures / expressions do n’t match the verbal statement , such as frowning when saying “ I love you . ”
• Expressions are limited to mouth movements when someone is faking emotions ( like happy , surprised , sad , awe , ) instead of the whole face .
For example ; when someone smiles naturally their whole face is involved : jaw / cheek movement , eyes and forehead push down , etc .
Also see our article on micro expressions & lying .
Interactions and Reactions
• A guilty person gets defensive .
An innocent person will often go on the offensive .
• A liar is uncomfortable facing his questioner / accuser and may turn his head or body away .
• A liar might unconsciously place objects ( book , coffee cup , etc. ) between themselves and you .
Verbal Context and Content
• A liar will use your words to make answer a question .
When asked , “ Did you eat the last cookie ? ”
The liar answers , “ No , I did not eat the last cookie . ”
• A statement with a contraction is more likely to be truthful : “ I did n’t do it ” instead of “ I did not do it ”
• Liars sometimes avoid “ lying ” by not making direct statements .
They imply answers instead of denying something directly .
• The guilty person may speak more than natural , adding unnecessary details to convince you … they are not comfortable with silence or pauses in the conversation .
•
A liar may leave out pronouns and speak in a monotonous tone .
When a truthful statement is made the pronoun is emphasized as much or more than the rest of the words in a statement .
• Words may be garbled and spoken softly , and syntax and grammar may be off .
In other words , his sentences will likely be muddled rather than emphasized .
• The use of distancing language .
Also see our article on Statement Analysis for a more in - depth look at word analysis techniques used by interrogators .
Other signs of a lie :
• If you believe someone is lying , then change subject of a conversation quickly , a liar follows along willingly and becomes more relaxed .
The guilty wants the subject changed ; an innocent person may be confused by the sudden change in topics and will want to back to the previous subject .
• Using humor or sarcasm to avoid a subject .
Final Notes :
Obviously , just because someone exhibits one or more of these signs does not make them a liar .
The above behaviors should be compared to a persons base ( normal ) behavior whenever possible .
Most lie detecting experts agree that a combination of body language and other cues must be used to make an educated guess on whether someone is telling the truth or a lie .

UPDATE : I just read that there are 1,173 pages of documents .
In the three hours alloted , that ’s a whopping 10 seconds a page the reporters can spend .
Yes , for three straight hours , imagine flipping a page every ten seconds , non-stop .
Assuming they ’re taking notes , and they are , the time would double , conservatively , so they ’d have 5 seconds a page .
Yeah , real full disclosure .
Joe reported yesterday on McCain ’s rather bizarre contortion regarding “ release ” of his medical records .
He ’s not “ releasing ” them at all .
Like some kind of supermarket game show where you get 5 minutes to stuff as many groceries in your basket before the time runs out , McCain is giving a select group of reporters only 3 hours to peruse through what are probably hundreds if not thousands of pages of documents , then when the buzzer rings , it ’s over , no more documents .
What does McCain think this is , some kind of game ?
We deserve to the know if the man is going to survive in office .
And playing this cute “ 3 hours , go ! ” game with his medical records , just makes it all the more suspicious .
What is he hiding ?
More from the NYT :
On Friday , the campaign will allow a small pool of reporters access to the records from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m.
Pacific time in a conference room at the Copper Wind Resort in Phoenix , near the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale .
The reporters will be allowed to take notes but not remove or photocopy the records .
Campaign officials said they were imposing the restrictions to prevent the actual records from wide dissemination .
You know what ?
Too freaking bad if John McCain does n’t want his medical records widely disseminated .
He ’s going to be 72 years old , he recently had cancer , he does n’t look all that well , and he wants us to hand him the keys to the country for the next four years .
Well , I ’d like to know he ’s going to survive four years of the hardest job in America , if not the world .
If McCain does n’t want to release his records , then he go find another job .
If he wants to be president of the United States of America during war time , then we should have access to all of his records , for as long as we wish .
Who the hell does he think he is ?
It ’s Bush and Cheney all again .
The arrogance is astonishing .

BBC Radio 4
Churchill has a deep sea port and rail but a population under 1,000 " The next economic boom is going to happen in northern Canada and Churchill 's going to be a part of that . "
So says Mike Spence , a part Cree Indian and part Orcadian Scot who is mayor of the tiny Canadian settlement of Churchill on Hudson Bay .
When I first arrived in the sub -Arctic town in early October , I found his claim hard to believe .
No one was on the streets as I wandered alongside a freight train which had just arrived from Winnipeg , 1000 km ( 600 miles ) to the south .
My big vision is that the port will be as busy as a beehive at least six months of the year
Mike Ogborn , Omnitrax Behind me was the port and the towering granary building - concrete and almost windowless .
Ahead the countless railroad trucks of grade A Canadian grain stretching far beyond the scattering of Churchill 's low lying buildings .
Countless , because I had been warned not to stray beyond the town 's limits as this was the beginning of polar bear season .
See map of the Arctic region
The weather forecast had suggested a 40 % chance of snow , but instead there was low cloud and rain , with no sign of any ice yet on the slate grey water of Hudson Bay .
Global warming Grain from Winnipeg awaits transport from Churchill harbour Winters are coming later to Churchill these days , and it 's global warming which Mike Spence reckons will bring the town 's big opportunity .
" We need to define the benefits of climate change - and there are many .
Look at a map of Northern Canada - there 's only one deep water port and Churchill is it , " says Mr Spence .
With the latest estimates of ice - free summers in the Arctic as early as 2013 and the Northwest Passage becoming navigable for the first time this year , Mr Spence claims that Churchill could find itself at the centre of a new network of international shipping routes .
Churchill can look to northern Europe as well as Asia , which puts it slap in the middle of an Arctic sea route that bypasses the Panama Canal and could shave two weeks off the journey between east and west .
$ 10 bargain
And if Churchill is to be the first boom town of the globally warmed age , one US company stands to do very nicely .
Ten years ago the dilapidated port and railroad were bought for just 10 Canadian dollars ( £5 ; $ 10 ) by Omnitrax , a transportation services company based in Colorado .
Not a bad price for derelict infrastructure which nobody wanted because it was ice - bound eight months of the year .
As the world beats a path to our Arctic doorstep , our government is working hard to ensure that Canada is ready to greet them when they arrive
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper
That C$ 10 now looks like a very good investment indeed and while managing director of Omnitrax , Mike Ogborn admits that global warming was not a topic around the board table in Denver at the time , it certainly is now .
" We already see a lengthening of the season by at least two weeks and we anticipate that that trend will continue , " he says .
" My big vision is that the port will be as busy as a beehive at least six months of the year , serving North America , Europe , the Middle East and Asia . "
That optimism is shared by the man who negotiated the sale to Omnitrax , Canadian statesman Lloyd Axworthy , minister of transport at the time .
" If you look at the transportation potential there are all kinds of opportunities which , 10 years out , I think could quite dramatically change the entire sea transit system , globally . "
He envisages Churchill as the key link in a chain , which would see goods arriving by ship from Europe and Asia , and then distributed by rail throughout North and Central America .
Arctic bridge
But the big vision for Churchill is not quite so clear out in the harbour where a tanker approaches through the mist to pick up that trainload of grain .
It is sailing in with empty holds and , as pilot Brian Moulton explains , that is the norm .
Churchill plans to be a major hub on an Arctic shipping highway " The inbound cargoes are few and far between .
Usually , coming in , it 's in ballast , " he says .
" This year they have just one Russian fertiliser ship coming in . "
That single Russian shipment , late in the season , was a historic arrival .
It was the first to use a proposed new route across the Arctic between Murmansk and Churchill .
Politicians have branded it " The Arctic Bridge " .
" What we have demonstrated is that this route is possible and is worth trying .
Now it is up to Churchill to market itself , " says Pavel Sarbashev from the Murmansk Shipping Company .
On my last day in Churchill , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper flew into this small community to announce a C$ 68 m investment in the port and railway .
" As the world beats a path to our Arctic doorstep , our government is working hard to ensure that Canada is ready to greet them when they arrive , " the prime minister told the town 's residents .
Less than one thousand people live in Churchill .
For the moment .
It is impossible to imagine how this neat and well kempt little town , rather beautifully landscaped from the rock and the scrubland on the banks of the Hudson Bay , will change if it does become a boom town in a warmer world .
And not that I want to pour cold water on its bright future , but as I leave for home I consider the natural as well as the economic uncertainties ahead .
For if sea levels rise too much , or the permafrost softens underneath the railroad , or Hudson Bay clogs up with ice floes from a disintegrating ice cap , or the Gulf Stream shifts direction , then Churchill 's big chance could melt away .

I wanted a picture of a chessboard .
Rather than boot up some drawing software and cut and paste black and white squares I decided to write a program to create the picture .
If you ’d like to know why anyone would ever create work for themselves in this way , skip to the end of this article , where you ’ll find justification and a more challenging follow - on problem .
Otherwise , please read on from top to bottom in the usual way .
Fredrik Lundh ’s Python Imaging Library ( commonly known as PIL ) must surely rank as one of the most popular Python libraries which does n’t come as standard [ 1 ] .
It ’s a fabulous tool which I ’ve used to create the graphic above ( though note that the double border around this graphic and subsequent ones is applied by a CSS style property ) .
Here ’s how .
PIL chessboard def draw_chessboard ( n=8 , pixel_width=200 ) : " Draw an n x n chessboard using PIL . " import Image , ImageDraw from itertools import cycle def sq_start ( i ) : " Return the x/y start coord of the square at column / row i. " return i * pixel_width / n def square( i , j ) : " Return the square corners , suitable for use in PIL drawings " return map ( sq_start , [ i , j , i + 1 , j + 1 ] ) image = Image.new ( " L " , ( pixel_width , pixel_width ) ) draw_square = ImageDraw .
Draw ( image ) .rectangle squares = ( square ( i , j ) for i_start , j in zip ( cycle ( ( 0 , 1 ) ) , range ( n ) ) for i in range ( i_start , n , 2 ) ) for sq in squares : draw_square ( sq , fill=' white ' ) image.save ( " chessboard -pil.png " )
Note :
We do n’t draw any black squares , instead relying on the default image background being black .
The “ L ” image type ( Luminance ? ) specifies a greyscale image .
PIL adopts the usual raster graphics convention , of the origin being in the top - left corner .
As we progress down the board row by row , the first white square alternates between being the first and second square of each row . Itertools.cycle( ( 0 , 1 ) ) achieves this nicely .
the board row by row , the first white square alternates between being the first and second square of each row .
achieves this nicely .
A regular 8 x 8 chessboard will , then , have a black square at the bottom left , which is the usual convention .
For odd values of n the bottom - left square would be white .
There may be rounding problems with this code if the supplied pixel width is n’t an integral multiple of n .
It ’s probably better to guarantee the image size , rather than round down the board size .
.
It ’s probably better to guarantee the image size , rather than round down the board size .
It would be better to parametrise the output file name , or even return the created image to clients .
For now , we ’ll just save to a fixed - name PNG .
PIL is a general purpose image processing library and it takes a little head - scratching and maths before we can even create something as simple as a chessboard .
ImageMagick provides tools to perform a similar job from the command - line , making the chessboard a one - liner .
ImageMagick chessboard $ N=8 $ PIXEL_WIDTH=200 $ convert - size $ ( ( N*15 ) ) x $ ( ( N*15 ) ) pattern : checkerboard \ - monochrome - resize $ PIXEL_WIDTH chessboard - magick.png
Here , the checkerboard pattern is an ImageMagick built - in which , inspecting its output , happens to generate 15x15 squares ( hence the 15 ’s in the script above ) .
The - monochrome filter renders the pattern in black and white , rather than its native light - on dark - grey .
The - size and - resize parameters should need no further explanation .
The ( ( double parentheses ) ) perform Bash shell arithmetic .
ImageMagick masquerades as a shell tool but really it ’s a powerful and fully featured programmer ’s imaging tool — a bit like a command - line version of Gimp [ 2 ] .
Although well documented , my gut reaction is that it pushes the command - line interface too far .
For more advanced image mangling , you ’ll probably need a program to generate the one - liner needed to drive convert .
Despite this reservation , it does the simple things simply , and it can do complex things too .
Recommended !
For a bit of fun , we can persuade Google to render the chessboard for us — in this case as a scatter plot using a square black markers [ 3 ] .
We flip the PIL processing around , drawing black squares on the ( default ) white background , and using the usual plotting convention which places the origin at the bottom left .
Google chart chessboard def chessboard_url ( n=8 , pixel_width=200 ) : " Returns the URL of a chessboard graphic . " def sq_midpt ( i ) : " Return the x/y midpt of a square in column / row i . " #
For text encoding , the graphic 's logical width is 100 return ( 0.5 + i ) * 100 . / n xys = [ ( sq_midpt ( i ) , sq_midpt ( j ) ) for i_start , j in zip ( cycle ( ( 0 , 1 ) ) , range ( n ) ) for i in range ( i_start , n , 2 ) ] fields = dict ( width=pixel_width , sqside=pixel_width/n , xs= " , " . join ( " %.02f " % x for x , _ in xys ) , ys= " , " .join ( " %.02f " % y for _ , y in xys ) ) return ( " http://chart.apis.google.com/chart? " " cht=s& " #
Draw a scatter graph " chd=t : %( xs ) s| % (ys ) s& " # using text encoding and " chm=s,000000 , 1,2.0 , %( sqside ) r& " # square black markers " chs= % ( width ) rx % ( width ) r " # at this size . ) % fields
Note that we plot our chart on a logical 100 x 100 rectangle , the coordinate space mandated by the encoding we ’ve chosen , then resize it to the physical dimensions supplied by the client .
This function actually returns the URL of a PNG which the Google chart API serves up .
Paste this URL into your browser address bar to see the graphic , or curl it to a local file .
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=s&chd=t:6.25,31.25…&chs=200x200
$ url=`python chessboard_url.py` $ curl $url > chessboard.png
We could embed the image into HTML using the IMG element , which is how I ’ve embedded the image which you should see below .
>>> from cgi import escape >>> img = ' < img src= " %s " alt =" chessboard graphic " />' >>> img % escape( chessboard_url ( ) )
As you can see , we have plenty of options , but unfortunately the image itself is n’t suitable .
You ca n’t get rid of the axes — or at least , I have n’t found a way to — and the rendered chart has some padding to the top and the right .
And worse , we ’re pretty much at the end of the line for this hack : if we wanted to do something more interesting , such as place pieces on the board , we ’re out of luck .
Of course this is n’t a flaw in the Google Chart API : we ’ve actually asked it to draw a scatter plot of the centres of black squares on a chessboard , using square black markers , a job it ’s done well enough .
Some examples showing the proper use of Google charts can be found in an article I wrote about maximum sum subsequences .
The chart URL might be considered a text encoding of the image ; the actual graphic is returned by a server .
There are other , more direct , textual representations .
ASCII art chessboard def outer_join ( sep , ss ) : " " " Like string .
join , but encloses the result with outer separators .
Example : >>> outer_join ('| ' , [ ' 1 ' , ' 2 ' , ' 3 ' ] ) ' | 1|2|3 | ' " " " return " %s%s %s " % ( sep , sep.join ( ss ) , sep ) def ascii_chessboard ( n=8 ) : " " " Draws an ASCII art chessboard .
Returns a string representation of an n x n board . " " " from itertools import islice , cycle divider = outer_join ( " + " , " - " * n ) + "
" row0 = outer_join ( " | " , islice ( cycle ( " B " ) , n ) ) + "
" row1 = outer_join ( " | " , islice ( cycle ( " B " ) , n ) ) + "
" return outer_join ( divider , islice ( cycle ( [ row0 , row1 ] ) , n ) )
I suspect this code was easier for me to write than it is for you to read !
It treats the chessboard as a sequence of alternating rows of alternating squares , which are then joined together for output .
>>> print ascii_chessboard (8 ) +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | |B| | B| | B| |B| +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| B| | B| | B| | B| | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | |B| | B| | B| |B| +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| B| | B| | B| | B| | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | |B| | B| | B| |B| +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| B| | B| | B| | B| | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | |B| | B| | B| |B| +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| B| | B| | B| | B| | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Not pretty , but such graphics may be useful in source code , which is typically viewed in a plain - text editor , and where ASCII art provides a way of embedding pictures right where they ’re needed .
On which point : if you ’re working through “ Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ” you may like to know the book is available in Texinfo format , with the pictures all rendered in ASCII art .
So you can split your editor window and run the code on one side , while browsing the book on the other .
Here ’s one of the figures :
* Figure 4.6 : * The `or ' combination of two queries is produced by operating on the stream of frames in parallel and merging the results .
+---------------------------+ | ( or A B ) | | +---+ | input | +->| A |------------+ | output stream of | | +---+ V | stream of frames | | ^ +-------+ | frames
-------------* | | merge +---------------> | | | +-------+ | | | | ^ | | | | +---+ | | | +------->|
B +------+ | | | +---+ | | | ^ | | | | | | +--*--+ | +---------|-----------------+ | data base
Even though I own a copy of the book and the full text is available on - line , this primitive info version has become my preferred format when actually running the code examples and exercises .
Most programming languages may be stuck in ASCII , but we need n’t restict ourselves in this way .
I found some block elements in the Geometrical Symbols section of the Unicode code charts ( Unicode Block Elements ( PDF ) ) .
Here ’s a pre-rendered block of text composed of the light and dark shade block characters , U+2591 LIGHT SHADE and U+2593 DARK SHADE .

I can think of plenty of other ways to draw a chessboard .
My favourite drawing environments are the pencil and paper , and the pen and whiteboard ; combine the former with a scanner and the latter with a digital camera and you ’ve got an easy route to an electronic version of your design .
For an HTML document I suspect SVG would be a good choice , but I do n’t know enough about SVG to state this with confidence .
I bet you could go a long way with CSS too .
Wikipedia ’s chess board is a table built on top of two small images , a light and a dark square , which I guess saves on bandwidth .
Why ever bother programming when all we want is a simple graphic ?
Well , for one thing , there ’s not that much programming .
The actual work of pushing pixels around is done by Google , or PIL , or ImageMagick .
Once we ’ve got a program written , it should be easy to adapt it .
We ’ve already put in hooks to specify the number of squares and the image dimensions .
It ’s equally easy to , for example , write out a JPEG rather than a PNG , or use different colours .
A programmatic solution is dynamic .
Google ’s chart API generates pictures on the fly , based on data points , ranges etc. which clients choose as and when .
It ’s rather like lazy - evaluation : pre-rendering all possibilities is n’t just expensive , it ’s out of the question .
That ’s quite enough pixels and characters for now , so this article will have to appear in two parts .
If I ’ve still not convinced you of the merits of creating images programmatically , please consider the following puzzle .
How would you draw a position reached in a game of chess , showing both the board and the pieces ?
And if I have convinced you , this exercise makes for a good workout .
Some Q&A’s .
Q : What position , exactly ?
: What position , exactly ?
A : Any !
: Any !
Q : How will the position be described ?
: How will the position be described ?
A : Your choice — it ’s an interesting part of the puzzle .
A great starting point would be to solve the puzzle using an ASCII art representation .
You can find my solution in this follow - up article .
Thanks to Marius Gedminas and Johannes Hoff for their help bug - fixing this article .
[ 1 ] I ’m confused about where exactly PIL belongs ; the official homepage seems to be on the PythonWare website ( http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/), but I usually head for the Effbot site , http://effbot.org/imagingbook/.
I think the sites mirror the same information , so it boils down to whether you prefer a blue or green theme , and how off - putting you find all the ads - by - google .
[ 2 ]
Actually , you can use Gimp from the command - line , and it comes with some tools for creating and editing batch files , and indeed for creating a personal suite of image processing scripts .
I ’ve never used Gimp in this way , so I ca n’t say much more about this .
[ 3 ]
In theory you could use the Google Chart API to render any image in a pointillist manner : just plot enough pixels in the right places .

PEP 371 -- Addition of the multiprocessing package to the standard library
PEP : 371 Title : Addition of the multiprocessing package to the standard library Author : Jesse Noller < jnoller at gmail.com > , Richard Oudkerk < r.m.oudkerk at googlemail.com >
Status : Final Type : Standards Track Created : 06 - May - 2008 Python - Version : 2.6 / 3.0 Post - History :
Abstract
This PEP proposes the inclusion of the pyProcessing package into the Python standard library , renamed to " multiprocessing " .
The processing package mimics the standard library threading module functionality to provide a process - based approach to threaded programming allowing end -users to dispatch multiple tasks that effectively side - step the global interpreter lock .
The package also provides server and client functionality ( processing .
Manager ) to provide remote sharing and management of objects and tasks so that applications may not only leverage multiple cores on the local machine , but also distribute objects and tasks across a cluster of networked machines .
While the distributed capabilities of the package are beneficial , the primary focus of this PEP is the core threading - like API and capabilities of the package .
Rationale
The current CPython interpreter implements the Global Interpreter Lock ( GIL ) and barring work in Python 3000 or other versions currently planned , the GIL will remain as - is within the CPython interpreter for the foreseeable future .
While the GIL itself enables clean and easy to maintain C code for the interpreter and extensions base , it is frequently an issue for those Python programmers who are leveraging multi-core machines .
The GIL itself prevents more than a single thread from running within the interpreter at any given point in time , effectively removing Python 's ability to take advantage of multi-processor systems .
The pyprocessing package offers a method to side - step the GIL allowing applications within CPython to take advantage of multi-core architectures without asking users to completely change their programming paradigm ( i.e. : dropping threaded programming for another " concurrent " approach - Twisted , Actors , etc ) .
The Processing package offers CPython a " known API " which mirrors albeit in a PEP 8 compliant manner , that of the threading API , with known semantics and easy scalability .
In the future , the package might not be as relevant should the CPython interpreter enable " true " threading , however for some applications , forking an OS process may sometimes be more desirable than using lightweight threads , especially on those platforms where process creation is fast and optimized .
For example , a simple threaded application : from threading import Thread as worker def afunc( number ) : print number * 3 t = worker ( target=afunc , args = ( 4 , ) ) t.start ( ) t.join ( )
The pyprocessing package mirrored the API so well , that with a simple change of the import to : from processing import process as worker
The code would now execute through the processing .
process class .
Obviously , with the renaming of the API to PEP 8 compliance there would be additional renaming which would need to occur within user applications , however minor .
This type of compatibility means that , with a minor ( in most cases ) change in code , users ' applications will be able to leverage all cores and processors on a given machine for parallel execution .
In many cases the pyprocessing package is even faster than the normal threading approach for I /O bound programs .
This of course , takes into account that the pyprocessing package is in optimized C code , while the threading module is not .
The " Distributed " Problem
In the discussion on Python - Dev about the inclusion of this package there was confusion about the intentions this PEP with an attempt to solve the " Distributed " problem - frequently comparing the functionality of this package with other solutions like MPI - based communication , CORBA , or other distributed object approaches .
The " distributed " problem is large and varied .
Each programmer working within this domain has either very strong opinions about their favorite module / method or a highly customized problem for which no existing solution works .
The acceptance of this package does not preclude or recommend that programmers working on the " distributed " problem not examine other solutions for their problem domain .
The intent of including this package is to provide entry - level capabilities for local concurrency and the basic support to spread that concurrency across a network of machines - although the two are not tightly coupled , the pyprocessing package could in fact , be used in conjunction with any of the other solutions including MPI / etc .
If necessary - it is possible to completely decouple the local concurrency abilities of the package from the network - capable / shared aspects of the package .
Without serious concerns or cause however , the author of this PEP does not recommend that approach .
Performance Comparison
As we all know - there are " lies , damned lies , and benchmarks " .
These speed comparisons , while aimed at showcasing the performance of the pyprocessing package , are by no means comprehensive or applicable to all possible use cases or environments .
Especially for those platforms with sluggish process forking timing .
All benchmarks were run using the following : 4 Core Intel Xeon CPU @ 3.00GHz
16 GB of RAM
Python 2.5.2 compiled on Gentoo Linux ( kernel 2.6.18.6 )
pyProcessing 0.52
All of the code for this can be downloaded from http://jessenoller.com/code/bench-src.tgz
The basic method of execution for these benchmarks is in the run_benchmarks .
py script , which is simply a wrapper to execute a target function through a single threaded ( linear ) , multi- threaded ( via threading ) , and multi-process ( via pyprocessing ) function for a static number of iterations with increasing numbers of execution loops and / or threads .
The run_benchmarks .py script executes each function 100 times , picking the best run of that 100 iterations via the timeit module .
First , to identify the overhead of the spawning of the workers , we execute a function which is simply a pass statement ( empty ) : cmd : python run_benchmarks .py empty_func.py Importing empty_func Starting tests ... non_threaded ( 1 iters ) 0.000001 seconds threaded ( 1 threads ) 0.000796 seconds processes ( 1 procs ) 0.000714 seconds non_threaded ( 2 iters ) 0.000002 seconds threaded ( 2 threads ) 0.001963 seconds processes ( 2 procs ) 0.001466 seconds non_threaded ( 4 iters ) 0.000002 seconds threaded ( 4 threads ) 0.003986 seconds processes ( 4 procs ) 0.002701 seconds non_threaded ( 8 iters ) 0.000003 seconds threaded ( 8 threads ) 0.007990 seconds processes ( 8 procs ) 0.005512 seconds
As you can see , process forking via the pyprocessing package is faster than the speed of building and then executing the threaded version of the code .
The second test calculates 50000 Fibonacci numbers inside of each thread ( isolated and shared nothing ) : cmd : python run_benchmarks.py fibonacci.py
Importing fibonacci Starting tests ... non_threaded ( 1 iters ) 0.195548 seconds threaded ( 1 threads ) 0.197909 seconds processes ( 1 procs ) 0.201175 seconds non_threaded ( 2 iters ) 0.397540 seconds threaded ( 2 threads ) 0.397637 seconds processes ( 2 procs ) 0.204265 seconds non_threaded ( 4 iters ) 0.795333 seconds threaded ( 4 threads ) 0.797262 seconds processes ( 4 procs ) 0.206990 seconds non_threaded ( 8 iters ) 1.591680 seconds threaded ( 8 threads ) 1.596824 seconds processes ( 8 procs ) 0.417899 seconds
The third test calculates the sum of all primes below 100000 , again sharing nothing : cmd : run_benchmarks .py crunch_primes.py
Importing crunch_primes Starting tests ... non_threaded ( 1 iters ) 0.495157 seconds threaded ( 1 threads ) 0.522320 seconds processes ( 1 procs ) 0.523757 seconds non_threaded ( 2 iters ) 1.052048 seconds threaded ( 2 threads ) 1.154726 seconds processes ( 2 procs ) 0.524603 seconds non_threaded ( 4 iters ) 2.104733 seconds threaded ( 4 threads ) 2.455215 seconds processes ( 4 procs ) 0.530688 seconds non_threaded ( 8 iters ) 4.217455 seconds threaded ( 8 threads ) 5.109192 seconds processes ( 8 procs ) 1.077939 seconds
The reason why tests two and three focused on pure numeric crunching is to showcase how the current threading implementation does hinder non -I/O applications .
Obviously , these tests could be improved to use a queue for coordination of results and chunks of work but that is not required to show the performance of the package and core processing .
process module .
The next test is an I / O bound test .
This is normally where we see a steep improvement in the threading module approach versus a single - threaded approach .
In this case , each worker is opening a descriptor to lorem.
txt , randomly seeking within it and writing lines to / dev/null : cmd : python run_benchmarks.py file_io.py Importing file_io Starting tests ... non_threaded ( 1 iters ) 0.057750 seconds threaded ( 1 threads ) 0.089992 seconds processes ( 1 procs ) 0.090817 seconds non_threaded ( 2 iters ) 0.180256 seconds threaded ( 2 threads ) 0.329961 seconds processes ( 2 procs ) 0.096683 seconds non_threaded ( 4 iters ) 0.370841 seconds threaded ( 4 threads ) 1.103678 seconds processes ( 4 procs ) 0.101535 seconds non_threaded ( 8 iters ) 0.749571 seconds threaded ( 8 threads ) 2.437204 seconds processes ( 8 procs ) 0.203438 seconds
As you can see , pyprocessing is still faster on this I/O operation than using multiple threads .
And using multiple threads is slower than the single threaded execution itself .
Finally , we will run a socket - based test to show network I /O performance .
This function grabs a URL from a server on the LAN that is a simple error page from tomcat .
It gets the page 100 times .
The network is silent , and a 10G connection : cmd : python run_benchmarks.py url_get.py Importing url_get Starting tests ... non_threaded ( 1 iters ) 0.124774 seconds threaded ( 1 threads ) 0.120478 seconds processes ( 1 procs ) 0.121404 seconds non_threaded ( 2 iters ) 0.239574 seconds threaded ( 2 threads ) 0.146138 seconds processes ( 2 procs ) 0.138366 seconds non_threaded ( 4 iters ) 0.479159 seconds threaded ( 4 threads ) 0.200985 seconds processes ( 4 procs ) 0.188847 seconds non_threaded ( 8 iters ) 0.960621 seconds threaded ( 8 threads ) 0.659298 seconds processes ( 8 procs ) 0.298625 seconds
We finally see threaded performance surpass that of single - threaded execution , but the pyprocessing package is still faster when increasing the number of workers .
If you stay with one or two threads / workers , then the timing between threads and pyprocessing is fairly close .
One item of note however , is that there is an implicit overhead within the pyprocessing package 's Queue implementation due to the object serialization .
Alec Thomas provided a short example based on the run_benchmarks .
py script to demonstrate this overhead versus the default Queue implementation : cmd : run_bench_queue .py non_threaded ( 1 iters ) 0.010546 seconds threaded ( 1 threads ) 0.015164 seconds processes ( 1 procs ) 0.066167 seconds non_threaded ( 2 iters ) 0.020768 seconds threaded ( 2 threads ) 0.041635 seconds processes ( 2 procs ) 0.084270 seconds non_threaded ( 4 iters ) 0.041718 seconds threaded ( 4 threads ) 0.086394 seconds processes ( 4 procs ) 0.144176 seconds non_threaded ( 8 iters ) 0.083488 seconds threaded ( 8 threads ) 0.184254 seconds processes ( 8 procs ) 0.302999 seconds Additional benchmarks can be found in the pyprocessing package 's source distribution 's examples / directory .
The examples will be included in the package 's documentation .
Maintenance Richard M. Oudkerk - the author of the pyprocessing package has agreed to maintain the package within Python SVN .
Jesse Noller has volunteered to also help maintain / document and test the package .
API Naming
While the aim of the package 's API is designed to closely mimic that of the threading and Queue modules as of python 2.x , those modules are not PEP 8 compliant .
It has been decided that instead of adding the package " as is " and therefore perpetuating the non-PEP 8 compliant naming , we will rename all APIs , classes , etc to be fully PEP 8 compliant .
This change does affect the ease - of - drop in replacement for those using the threading module , but that is an acceptable side - effect in the view of the authors , especially given that the threading module 's own API will change .
Issue 3042 in the tracker proposes that for Python 2.6 there will be two APIs for the threading module - the current one , and the PEP 8 compliant one .
Warnings about the upcoming removal of the original java - style API will be issued when - 3 is invoked .
In Python 3000 , the threading API will become PEP 8 compliant , which means that the multiprocessing module and the threading module will again have matching APIs .
Timing / Schedule Some concerns have been raised about the timing / lateness of this PEP for the 2.6 and 3.0 releases this year , however it is felt by both the authors and others that the functionality this package offers surpasses the risk of inclusion .
However , taking into account the desire not to destabilize Python - core , some refactoring of pyprocessing 's code " into " Python - core can be withheld until the next 2.x/3.x releases .
This means that the actual risk to Python - core is minimal , and largely constrained to the actual package itself .
Open Issues Confirm no " default " remote connection capabilities , if needed enable the remote security mechanisms by default for those classes which offer remote capabilities .
Some of the API ( Queue methods qsize ( ) , task_done ( ) and join ( ) ) either need to be added , or the reason for their exclusion needs to be identified and documented clearly .
Closed Issues
The PyGILState bug patch submitted in issue 1683 by roudkerk must be applied for the package unit tests to work .

Reliance on ctypes :

What goes around ...
The Washington Post :
A year ago , the Mortgage Bankers Association was thrilled to sign a contract to buy a fancy new headquarters building in downtown Washington .
Interest rates were low , the group 's revenues were steady and the prospects for quickly renting out part of the structure were strong .
But since then , the association has fallen on tough times as many of the subprime mortgages dispensed by some of its members proved dicey .
Borrowers discovered the loans were more costly than they had anticipated .
Foreclosures soared , and cheap , inexpensive credit dried up , slowing the economy .
The result :
The trade group is about to find it harder than it imagined to pay its own mortgage .

Until you figure out the trick of each level , you ’ll often find yourself doomed to repeat the level , and even now , when I mess up on a level , I make sure it ’s me who augers myself into the side of the truck , and not some punk ass building , “ I ’ll see you hell , nuclear truck ! ”

What makes Jet Force Gemini work is a philosophy that is prevalent throughout Rareware ’s games :
Make it easy to beat , but difficult ( and rewarding ) to complete 100 percent .
Since you ’ll find new power - ups along the way ( such as robot droids , keys , weapons and jet packs ) , you ’ll want to backtrack through the levels to explore previously unreachable areas and find secrets – this boosts the game ’s replay value immensely .

The superior opposition is definitely one of the highlights of the gameplay .
The level designs are also huge and clever .
Everything is placed to increase drama , and all the atmospheres change dramatically throughout the quest .
You will fight atop elevators , take to the sky and defy gravity , bear the desert heat , side - scroll , clash swords with the enemy , and even fight the earth itself .
Needless to say the levels are a treat for the senses and will always keep you on your toes . ”

By pressing the A or B button you can switch the blocks around .

Although S.C.A.R.S is Vivid Image ’s first Nintendo 64 title , the London - based developer managed to squeeze smooth framerates , vibrant colors and unprecedented lighting effects out of the hardware that put even Rare ’s efforts to shame .

Controlling the main character , players run around the 3D environments much like in Konami ’s own Castlevania .
The whip and sword have been replaced by a painfully wimpy weapon called the Defuser ( do n’t get your hopes up , it does n’t get more powerful ) , enemies that can be “ defused ” are limited to floating laser probes and mouse bots , and the deadly guillotine traps that plagued Schneider have made way for equally pesky flame barriers .
If you ’re the type who easily gets bored with the turn - based battles in many of the Japanese roleplaying games like Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy , then you may want to stay away from this game – the action is not enough to carry it .

( CNN ) --
Three protesters scaled the Golden Gate Bridge Monday and unfurled a " Free Tibet " banner , a likely precursor to large protests when the Olympic torch arrives Wednesday in San Francisco , California .
Members of Students for a Free Tibet climbed the bridge to place these banners , said the group 's spokesman .
The banner read , " One World .
One Dream .
Free Tibet . "
Those who climbed cables from which the bridge is suspended are members of Students for a Free Tibet , said group spokesman Tenzin Dasang .
The three were arrested along with four others at the site .
All seven were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance , said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein .
The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing .
Watch protesters and banner hung from bridge »
The incident forced the closure of one northbound lane of the bridge .
The climbers -- who were on the bridge for about three hours -- came down voluntarily about 1:15 p.m. ( 4:15 p.m. ET ) after workers with the Golden Gate Bridge District began cutting down their banner , Ziegenbein said .
Dasang said he has heard of many people planning to protest in San Francisco against China 's human rights record .
" We want it to be peaceful .
But it will be large , " said Dasang , 22 , during a phone interview in which he said he was near the bridge .
" I heard from Tibetans that now live all over the U.S. and even abroad who are coming here . "
The Olympic flame is on a 130 - day journey that will take it through 23 cities on five continents and then throughout China , culminating at the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing August 8 .
The San Francisco protest comes the same day as a demonstration in Paris , France , disrupted the torch relay many times .
In Paris , police had to cut the Olympic torch relay short Monday amid protests against China 's human rights record , French police said .
The torch was scheduled to travel 17 miles , past Paris City Hall , but that stop and others were called off after the protests .
The torch made it through about 10 miles of its scheduled journey .
It was then driven by bus to its final destination , where it was displayed again during a public ceremony at a stadium .
Authorities had to play hide - and - seek with the Olympic torch during much of the route , placing it on a bus at least twice during a sometimes chaotic relay route .
China has come under international criticism because of its crackdown last month on protesters calling for democratic freedoms and self - rule in Tibet and neighboring Chinese provinces .
Protesters have said more than 100 people have died in the crackdown , but Beijing denies that and has accused supporters of the Dalai Lama of orchestrating the violence .
U.S. and other Western leaders have called on China to provide civil rights and freedoms to those in Tibet and to enter peaceful discussions aimed at resolving the crisis .

OpportunityRover Rolls Onward
The Opportunity Mars rover is free and once again driving southward at MeridianiPlanum .
Wheelingits way ever closer to the large Victoria Crater , the robot extracted itselffrom a wheel - stopping sand trap , now dubbed Jammerbugt .
" I honestly do n't know how difficult the driving is going tobe between here and Victoria , " said Steve Squyres , lead scientist for the MarsExploration Rover project .
" The terrain we 're in right now has little exposedbedrock , and that makes it more treacherous than when there 's bedrock around .
So we 're going to tread cautiously .
But what lies farther ahead is difficult tosay ... we 'll find out as we go , " he told SPACE.com .
Squyressaid that the main difference between Jammerbugt and Purgatory - a dune that snaredOpportunity in April 2005 -- is that an onboard slip - check stopped the rover atJammerbugt before it had dug in very far .
" This iswhy we use the slip - checks , to keep us from getting deeply embedded ifsomething happens , " Squyres said .
" And because we had n't dug in as badly as atPurgatory , we got out with significantly greater ease .
It also helped , ofcourse , that we'd been through this once before ... it 's always easier when youknow what you 're doing ! "

Opportunity has beenslogging its way over sand ripples , finding the best traction by moving betweenpatches of flat - lying rock outcrops .
The robot has been wheeling toward largeVictoria Crater - an enormous depression , measuring a half - mile ( 800 meters ) indiameter .

Susan and Lance Greninger called NASA becausethey had bought the box at an auction near the Kennedy Space Center .
A Hazmat teamfrom the fire department examined the metal and said it was a solid piece ofdepleted uranium about the size of a child 's fist .
They closed the road in the front of the homefor about five hours just to be safe .
The state Bureau of Radiation Control retrieved the cylinder .
They said the piece is toxic , but does not pose a health hazardto the community .
They did say that if the couple had walked around the housewith the uranium in their pocket , they would get radiation sickness .
Authorities said the piece may have been part ofa tool .

MicrosatelliteTested Aboard Space Station
NASA astronautJeffrey Williams has put a small satellite through its initial paces aboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) , deploying the free - flying craft insideoutpost 's Destiny lab .
Williams , NASA science officer and ISS Expedition 13 flight engineer , piloted the SPHERESmicrosatellite in the first of a series of test aimed at demonstratingfundamental concepts for autonomous docking in small vehicles and formationflying .
The tests could lay the groundwork for cooperative satellites andhelper robots to aid spacewalking astronauts , NASA officials said .
SPHERES - short for Synchronized Position Hold Engage Re-orient Satellite - is anexperiment designed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) to aid the development of future cooperative space robots .
Williamswatched over the single SPHERES satellite last week as it approached twobeacons - one handheld and one wall - mounted - during simulated rendezvous anddocking maneuvers .
The satellite 's first flight included up to 15 pre-plannedmaneuvers , each of which lasted 10 minutes , to check attitude control , stationkeeping , collision avoidance , target tracking and fuel balance performance , NASA officials said .
Theeight - inch ( 20 - centimeter ) wide , seven - pound ( three - kilogram ) SPHERES satelliteis the first of three to launch toward the ISS and arrived at the space stationaboard Progress21 on April 26 .
Two additional units are expected to launch toward thestation on future NASA shuttle visits .

FormerNazi Removed From Space Hall of Fame
ALAMOGORDO , N.M. - A former Nazi scientist who was linked to experiments on prisoners inthe Dachau concentration camp in Germany has been ousted from the InternationalSpace Hall of Fame .
HubertusStrughold , who had been honored in 1978 for work in developing the spacesuitand space capsule and for his contributions to space medicine , was removed lastweek by unanimous vote of the New Mexico Museum of Space History 's commission .
The German - born scientist was brought to this country by the U.S. military afterWorld War II to work on aerospace projects .
He died in 1987 .
The removalprocess began last fall after a museum visitor noticed Strughold 's name in itshall of fame and notified the New Mexico Anti-Defamation League , said SusanSeligman , the league 's regional director .
The leagueuncovered records of Strughold 's past and presented them to the commission .
Strughold was linked to experiments on concentration camp prisoners in the1940s as the Nazi director of medical research for aviation , Seligman said , though she said she did not know of him personally conducting experiments .
Strughold ' sname was removed from Brooks Air Force Base 's aero-medical library in 1995 andhis picture was removed from the mural " The World History of Medicine " at Ohio State University in 1993 , the Anti-Defamation Leaguesaid .

FirmsPlan Low- cost Workhorse Rocket Engine
Twopropulsion firms - XCOR Aerospace and Alliant Techsystems ( ATK ) - haveannounced they are teamed to develop a low - cost liquid oxygen / methane rocketengine for NASA 's Crew Exploration Vehicle ( CEV ) .
This type of workhorse engineis being designed for possible use in returning the CEV from lunar orbit to the Earth , and to perform in - space maneuvering .
XCORAerospace is based in Mojave , California .
The company won a $ 3.3 millioncontract with ATK , headquartered in Minneapolis , Minnesota , as part of ATK 's $ 10.4 million contract to develop low - cost liquid oxygen / methane rocketpropulsion for NASA .
Methane - fueledengines offer the prospect of better performance and lower cost than existingsystems and are non -toxic .
In addition , such an engine eliminates the need forspecial ground handling procedures associated with traditional propulsionsystems .
Non-toxic engines may significantly reduce the cost of fueling andservicing operations .
Ifsuccessfully demonstrated , the liquid oxygen / methane propulsion system could beused for both the CEV Service Module main engine and on the ascent stage for acrew - carrying lunar lander .
Yet anotherconsideration is that the Martian atmosphere contains methane - and givenNASA 's future red planet plans , this type of engine should prove ideal forgas - up - and - go operations .
" This contractis a great example of a small company teaming with an established provider toprovide innovative solutions to difficult problems , " noted James Busby , an XCORAerospace spokesman .

NASA 'sShuttle Discovery Again Set for Short Trip
CAPECANAVERAL , Fla . - NASA 's space shuttle Discovery is again set to for the shortride from its hangar to the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building ( VAB ) asengineers prepare to mate the orbiter to its fuel tank and rocket boosters .
Delayedfrom Thursday due to a damaged cranescrew in the VAB , today 's rollover has been pushed back to today to allow amorning meeting for shuttle officials , NASA spokesperson Jessica Rye said .
Theupcoming 30 - minute trip from Discovery 's hangar - like Orbiter Processing Facilityto the VAB will mark the space plane 's first move since it returned to KSCfollowing last year 's STS - 114 mission - NASA 's first shuttle flight since the 2003 Columbia accident .
Shuttleengineers are preparing Discovery for NASA 's second post -Columbia test flight - STS - 121 commanded by veteran astronaut Steven Lindsey - slated to launch no earlierthan July 1 .
In the VAB , the external fuel tank and twin solid rocket boosters that will carry Discoveryto space have already been assembled and stacked atop a Mobile Launch Platform .
Engineers plan to spend about one week attaching Discovery to the launch stackbefore rolling the entire shuttle system out to Pad 39B on May 19 .
Discoverylast launched into space in July 2005 on a 14 - day mission to the InternationalSpace Station ( ISS ) .
The orbiter landedat Edwards Air Force Base in California and was ferriedback to KSC atop its 747 jumbo jet carrier .

CaliforniaPolitician Seeks Display Rights for Atlantis Orbiter
California Assemblywoman Sharon Runner has introduced a Joint Resolutionthat , if passed , would transmit an official request to the President andleaders of Congress to grant Palmdale as the future and permanent home of spaceshuttle Atlantis .
Runner 's resolution is the result of a NASA briefing thatsuggested it will ground Atlantisin 2008 , rather than put it through a required maintenance period thatcould exceed the end of the shuttle program in 2010 .
As it is written however , the bill would appear to neglect existing requirements for howNASA must dispose of artifacts and its agreement for their transfer to the Smithsonian .
Runner 's reasons outlined in the bill for Atlantis to moveto Palmdale include the city 's history as where all of NASA 's orbiters werefirst assembled , and to allocate room at Kennedy Space Center for futureexploration vehicles .
" It just makes sense for Atlantis to return home toPalmdale , " said Runner .
" This resolution is an important step in theprocess .
It will demonstrate that California is united behind Palmdale as theproper location . "

RoadkillPosse Cleans Up at NASA Spaceport
CAPE CANAVERAL - TheRoadkill Posse at Kennedy Space Center is cleaning up .
Literally .
More than 800 pounds ( 362 kilograms ) of carrion have been collected around KSC since NASA in mid-April askedworkers to call in roadkill sightings .
Coming in the wake of abird strike during the STS - 114 launch last July , the roadkill reporting program is aimed at ridding thespaceport of black vultures and turkey vultures .
The vultures roost aroundNASA 's twin shuttle launch pads , and a bird strike in flight can cause seriousdamage to an orbiter .
NASA hopes that eliminatinga major food source will prompt the scavengers to go live elsewhere .

SupplyShip Boosts Space Station's Orbit
The International Space Station ( ISS ) reached a higher orbit Thursday after a cargoship fired its engines during a brief , but successful , maneuver , NASA officialssaid .
The Progress 21 cargo ship docked at the aft end of the station 's Zvezda modulefired its onboard engines for 6.5 minutes , boosting the orbital laboratory ' sorbit by about 1.7 miles ( 2.8 kilometers ) , NASA Johnson Space Centerspokesperson James Hartsfield told SPACE.com .
NASAofficials said the orbital boost prepared the ISS for the June arrival of Progress 22 , a new cargo ship that will launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome , Kazakhstan in Central Asia atop a Soyuz rocket .
Progress 22is expected to launch on June 24 and dock at the ISS two days later , Hartsfieldsaid , adding that an older cargo ship - Progress 20 - will be cast off prior to the new spacecraft 's arrival .
Progress20 has been dockedat the Russian - built Pirs docking compartment since December 23 , 2005 .
Thursday 'sISS orbit reboost comes after an abortedtest of the two ISS engines attached to the Zvezdamodule 's aft end .
Russian ISS controllers used the test to check whether the Zvezda engines , which were last used in July 2000 , were still operational .
Thefailed engine firing did not affect the docking of Progress 21 .
Progress 21 arrived at the ISS on April 26 after a two - day spaceflightfrom Baikonur Cosmodrome .
The cargo ship ferried 2.5 tons of food and suppliesto ISSExpedition 13 commander PavelVinogradov and flight engineer JeffreyWilliams .
The two astronauts are in the midst of a six - month mission aboardthe ISS and arrivedat the station on April 1 .

BackhoeHo-Down on Mars
The nextrobotic arm headed for the red planet is ready for final testing andinstallation onto NASA 's MarsPhoenix lander , due for liftoff in August of next year .
Thebackhoe - like arm was built by Alliance Spacesystems , Inc. ( ASI ) of Pasadena , California .
Once on Mars in May 2008 , the arm is assigned a key duty of digginga two - foot deep trench in Mars ' north - polar region .
At thebusiness end of the arm is a scoop about the size of a garden trowel that willdo the digging down to an ice layer that is potentially rock - hard .
The arm willdeliver soil samples to a suite of devices on the lander 's deck for detailedanalysis .
A camera mounted on the arm will view layers in the freshly - dugtrench wall .
Theagile arm has a 7.5 - foot reach ( 2.3 meters ) , with the aluminum and titaniumdevice weighing less than 22 pounds ( 9.7 kilograms ) .
The roboticarm - inherited from a shelved 2001 Mars mission to the equator - could not dig intohard icy soils at cold temperatures and had to be completely redesigned .
MarsPhoenix is a three - month mission expected to yield new clues to the history ofwater on Mars and whether the environment was ever conducive to life .

RoadkillPickup May Save Lives , NASA Says
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . ( AP ) - Picking up roadkill may save astronauts ' lives .
Kennedy Space Centermanagers said Thursday they have launched an effort encouraging workers tonotify road - and - grounds crews when they see roadkill .
The theory is that removingdead animals could cut down on the number of vultures looking for meals at the 140,000 - acre center , part of which is a national wildlife refuge .
A vulturestruck the fuel tank of space shuttle Discovery during last year 's launch , but it did n't cause any major damage .
" We 're trying to avoid thatagain and by doing that we 're trying to reduce the food source , '' said JohnShaffer , a scientist who works at Kennedy 's environmental program office .
" Asfar as shuttle program is concerned , it 's unacceptable if there 's anotherchance of an accident . ''
Roadkillis a common sight at the center , which is home to more than 500 species ofwildlife , including bald eagles , sea turtles , alligators and manatees .
NASAlaunch managers use cameras and radar to make sure there are no birds aroundthe launch pad during shuttle launches .

Contaminationa Likely Culprit in Failed Proton M Launch
The malfunctionof a Russian - built Proton rocket that left an Arab communications satellite inthe wrong orbit after launch was apparently due to contamination in thebooster 's oxidizer system , Russia 's State Commission announced Tuesday .
The commission , which investigated the failed Feb .
28 EDT space shot
, foundthat an anomaly - likely from a foreign particle - interrupted the oxidizersupply for the Proton M rocket 's Breeze M upper stage and forced an earlyengine shutdown , according to a statement from McLean , Virginia - basedInternational Launch Services ( ILS ) , which marketed the flight .
ILS used the ProtonMrocketto launch the ARABSAT4A communications satellite for the Arab SatelliteCommunications Organization of Riyadh , Saudi Arabia .
The satellite neverreached its intended orbit .
Mishapinvestigators believe that the foreign particle blocked oxidizer flow through anozzle that fed the Breeze M engine 's hydraulic pump , the statement said .
ILS andRussian space officials have drawn up a set of corrective actions to beimplemented before the U.S. firm 's next launch .
Those actions should becompleted by the end of May , paving the way for the resumption of launchservices , ILS said .

NASA 'sCloudSat and CALIPSO Launch Scrubbed Again
The plannedlaunch of two NASA satellites aimed at taking a three - dimensional look atEarth 's clouds and particle content was called of again Sunday due to aircraft refuelingplane schedule problems , the U.S. space agency said .
For thesecond day in a row , the lack of a refueling aircraft for a radar trackingplane needed to watch over the launch of NASA 's CloudSat and CALIPSO weathersatellites prevented the planned space shot atop a Delta 2 rocket fromCalifornia 's Vandenberg Air Force Base .
The launch countdown had already begunand was about five hours from liftoff when the scrub was called .
NASAofficials said the launch of CloudSat and CALIPSO has been postponed for atleast another 24 hours as mission managers decide on a new flight date .
A similarrefueling plan unavailability on Saturday prompted NASA to shift its CloudSatand CALIPSO launch target to Sunday .
A communications glitch with the French - built CALIPSO spacecraft also scrubbed an April 21 launch attempt just 48seconds before liftoff .
The twospacecraft are expected to join a trio of other Earth - watching satellites - NASA 's Aqua and Aura , and the French Space Agency 's PARASOL - already in Earthorbit .
CloudSat is equipped with a powerful cloud - penetrating radar , while CALIPSO carries a laser ranging lidar instrument , wide - field visible lightcamera and an imaging infrared radiometer .

Japan Preparesfor Unmanned Lunar Lander Mission
TOKYO ( AP ) - Japan 's space agency has set up a team to send an unmanned mission to thesurface of the moon , possibly within the next 10 years , officials saidWednesday .
KeijiTachikawa , chairman of the space agency JAXA , provided no further details ofthe composition of the team , but said he hoped the mission would be launchedwithin a decade .
The unmannedsurface landing is a key element of Japan 's overall space strategy , which wasonce the most ambitious in Asia but has recently fallen behind China .
JAXA 's SELENEmoon orbiter is due for launch in 2007 , and officials announced last year that theyhope to send a manned mission to the moon by 2025 .
Currently , only the United States , Russia and the EU have landed probes on the moon .
ButChina , which leapt ahead of Japan by putting astronauts into orbit in 2005 , hasalso announced it has set its sights on a moon landing .
Japan has yet to launcha manned flight of its own .
No timeline for the manned program has beenannounced , other than the tentative 2025 goal for a landing .
Over the nextdecade , JAXA 's plan calls for scientists to develop robots and nanotechnologyfor surveys of the moon , and design a rocket and space vessel capable ofcarrying cargo and passengers .
By 2015 , JAXA will review whether it 's ready topour resources into manned space travel and possibly building a base on themoon .
A decision topossibly to try for Mars and other planets would be made after 2025 .
Japan ' slong - term plan resembles those of U.S. President George W. Bush and Europeanspace officials , who hope to land astronauts and robots on the moon as a firststep to sending space shuttle missions to Mars .
But Japan ' sprogram has been plagued by delays .
The SELENEprobe - designed to release two small satellites that will measure the moon ' smagnetic and gravitational field - was originally scheduled for launch in 2003 , but that had to be postponed after the failed launch of one of Japan ' sdomestically developed H - 2A rockets .
JAXA also hadto abandon a mission to Mars two years ago and earlier this year the agency nearlylostits most recent mission - a probe sent to collect samples from an asteroid - but managed to re-establish communications with it last month .
