The Flint Journal reports that Robert J. Parker
Jr filed a $ 66 million dollar federal lawsuit against the Michigan Genesse County Friend of the Court , Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox and FOC Jennie Barkey who is now a county probate judge .
I would do the same !
The Michigan Genesse County Friend of the Court pursued Mr. Parker for 20 years for past due child support he did not owe .
After being located and jailed he fought back and WON in the State Court of Appeals .
Now he is suing for damages in the Federal Court system .
Is there really this type of corruption in the Friend of the Courts systems throughout the country ?

Taken into Custody : The War Against Fatherhood , Marriage , and the Family
The scientists pinpointed three important brain areas Scientists say they have located the parts of the brain that comprehend sarcasm - honestly .
By comparing healthy people and those with damage to different parts of the brain , they found the front of the brain was key to understanding sarcasm .
Damage to any of three different areas could render individuals unable to understand sarcastic comments .
The Israeli team from Haifa University told Neuropsychology how their findings might help to explain autism features .
See what goes on in the brain Autistic children can have problems interpreting sarcasm as well as other social cues such as emotions .
If someone has a problem understanding a social situation , he or she may fail to understand the literal language
Researcher Dr Simone Shamay - Tsoory
This same skill is sometimes lost in people with brain damage , suggesting similar brain regions may be involved in autism .
Brain scan studies of autistic children have shown that they have different activity in the frontal lobe to other children .
Dr Simone Shamay - Tsoory and colleagues studied 25 people with prefrontal lobe damage , 16 with damage to the posterior lobe of the brain and 17 healthy volunteers .
They played the study participants tape - recorded stories , some sarcastic and some neutral .
An example of sarcasm was " Joe came to work , and instead of beginning to work , he sat down to rest .
His boss noticed and said to Joe ' do n't work too hard . ' "
In fact , what Joe 's boss actually meant by his comment was " you are a slacker " .
In the neutral version Joe came to work and began work immediately .
His boss made the same " do n't work too hard " comment , but this time , he actually meant that Joe was a hard worker .
The volunteers who had damage to their prefrontal lobes were unable to correctly interpret the sarcastic story , while all of the other participants could .
Anatomy Dr Shamay - Tsoory said this fitted with what is already known about the anatomy of the brain .
She said language areas on the left hand side of the brain interpret the literal meaning of words and the frontal lobes and the right side of the brain understand the social and emotional context .
An area called the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex then integrates the literal meaning with the social / emotional context , which will reveal any sarcasm .
" A lesion in each region in the network can impair sarcasm , because if someone has a problem understanding a social situation , he or she may fail to understand the literal language , " she said .
A spokeswoman from the National Autistic Society said : " The causes of autism are still being investigated .
" Many experts believe that the pattern of behaviour from which autism is diagnosed may not result from a single cause .
" There is strong evidence to suggest that autism can be caused by a variety of physical factors , all of which affect brain development . "

What are these ?
Some people ask me why I ’m working on something as big as an MMOG by myself .
Here ’s a list of reasons why you should n’t partner with someone in a business :
A partnership is a marriage
My neighbor runs the biggest Mailboxes Etc. in Newport Beach and complains about this topic every time I bring up the issue .
When you have a partner no longer can you do what is best for the business .
On all major points you now need to consult your partner .
You ’re going to spend most of your waking hours with your partner , more than your girlfriend or wife .
If you do n’t get along a ‘ divorce ’ is going to be just as expensive as a real divorce , and possibly kill the business you put the years of your life into .
You would n’t marry someone unless you knew them well first and only 1 person in 1000 is worthy marrying .
How many people do you know that well at all , much less are worth partnering with ?
Your reasons for finding a partner is probably short - term but the partnership is long - term
When starting a business there ’s a lot to do and a lot of difficulties that can be most easily and effectively solved by someone else .
In my case , I need art for my game and I do n’t have much money to pay for it .
One solution is to partner with an artist .
So lets say I were to grab a friend who I know well , get along with , and who does a good job at art .
If the business is successful , 10 years from now I gave up half the business so I could save 30 K on artwork .
Stupid .
It ’s like those idiots who get venture capital from Y Combinator .
They give up some percentage of their startup for a measly $ 6000 per founder .
If you are so hard up you ca n’t scrape together $ 6000 you do n’t have the connections , work experience , or qualifications to run a business .
Your payoff is p/n , where n goes up by 1 for each partner
That ’s profit / number of partners .
Of course p may go up too , and if p goes up by more than the inverse of ( n+1 ) then it ’s worth it .
But that ’s unlikely unless you partner with a superstar .
At n=1 you ’d have to double your profit to make up for it .
It ’s easy to envision two people doubling income but I did n’t say that .
I said two partners doubling profit .
Would a partner , vs. an employee , make that much more ?
Keep in mind a partner , unless they work for free , is going to draw a salary from your income too , thus reducing profit .
Do you need a partner , or an employee ?
Following from my previous message , do you really need a partner , as opposed to an employee ?
You have to ask yourself “ Am I partnering for someone to do a specific job ? ”
Because if you are , hire an employee instead .
If you ca n’t afford an employee … this is one reason to find a partner .
They can bring the money you need where otherwise it would be impossible to make your business succeed ( I ’m talking hundreds of thousands , not $ 6000 ) .
Another reason is if your partner is such a superstar and they are so critical to the business that you would never be able to hire them otherwise .
That ’s rarely the case .
Most people are n’t cut out to run a business
Not everyone is a superstar .
If they were , we would n’t call them superstars anymore .
We ’d call them average .
Most people are average by the very definition of the word , with half the people below average and half above average .
How many superstars do you know at work ?
Probably 1 or 2 right ?
So they can program , or do art , or whatever .
How are their social skills ?
Their business sense ?
Do they bring capital with them that they are willing to part with ?
Are they good at managing people ?
Are they a superstar at every one of these things , or enough of them to compliment yourself ?
You have a 1 / p^n chance of finding such a person .
So the odds are , whoever you are thinking of partnering with might help you today but wo n’t be carrying their weight tomorrow .
Some people can’t hold long - term interests
A business is n’t a 9 - 5 job .
It ’s a 9 - 9 job , and will be for some number of years , if not the rest of your life .
Can your potential partner stick with things this long ?
If not , it ’s going to cost you a lot of stress and money down the road when they decide they work too hard and should stick to management .
Back when I was in Alaska there was a good opportunity to start a computer store .
There was only one other computer store in the city and they overcharged , were rude , and had a poor selection .
At the time the internet was still growing so there was no real way to order over the internet either .
At the time I did n’t have much business sense so I partnered with my cousin to start such a store .
I wrote up some business proposals to send to family to try to get money to get the initial batch of parts and open the storefront .
I called and looked around to try to find a suitable location .
I worked out the math on the finances and contacted a vendor who I could order from .
My cousin… well he was excited to talk about what to name the store .
After a week of my bitching at him to help , he said “ Why should I do anything when you ’re doing it all ? ”
As it turns out I was right .
About 2 years later a Computer City opened there .
They went out of business , but then CompUSA opened a year later and has been there since .
With a 2 year lead into the market I could have potentially done very well for myself .
Summary
Do n’t partner with someone just because it ’s exciting to do so , or you need a short - term employee .
Partnerships only make sense if you
And the economists in the room smack their foreheads and let out a resounding “ D’UH ! ” *
Yep , what a surprise :
At the Coche wholesale food market in southwestern Caracas , business is topsy - turvy : Vendors say they have nothing to sell .
“ Our suppliers are saying , ` No , we had an accident at the plant , ' ” said Jose Branco , manager of a dairy store in Coche , the Venezuelan capital ’s largest open market .
“ So we have to limit the amount of product we sell to each customer . ”
The tale is being repeated throughout this country of 26 million .
The reason : Inflation is now so high that the government has put price controls on basic goods such as chicken , beef and sugar , leaving vendors in search of an escape hatch . …
The inflation rate in Venezuela has now hit 20.4 percent , the highest in the Western Hemisphere , amid the widespread changes instituted by President Hugo Chavez .
The retail sellers understand what ’s going on .
And they know they ’re stuck between a rock and a hard place :
At the Coche wholesale market , meat seller Varela says the prices have left him in a quandary .
“ I could sell the meat secretly , because there ’s demand , or I could not sell because the price is n’t any good , or I could change professions , ” he said caustically .
So he can break the law , or he can go out of business .
Either shows the folly of price controls .
As any economist will tell you , when you remove the profit margin , done here to the point where often a business will lose money by selling at the approved prices , you see the end of supply :
Wilson Rangel , who runs a meatpacking plant in the Baruta municipality along the southern edge of Caracas , said he used to get 120 cows a week .
But last week , he said , he received 20 because it ’s not profitable to slaughter cows at such low prices .
“ There are five slaughterhouses around here , but the cows are n’t coming , ” he said .
Cheese , sugar and chicken supplies have also dwindled .
Blocks of cheese can cost distributors more than double what they sell it for , they said ; sugar supplies have slowed .
Now remember , with high oil prices , Chavez and Venezuela are flush with money .
So why ca n’t the people of Venezuela get a hold of things like beef , chicken , cheese , and sugar ?
Maybe some of the Chavez apologists can explain this to me ?
Of course , the Venezuelan government has a “ plan ” to stop the inflation that has hit such high levels .
But Venezuelan financial analysts think they ’re offering empty promises .
Annual inflation reached 20.4 percent in Venezuela in February , as soaring government spending pumped cash into the economy and exchange controls trapped money in the system .
“ Prices are going to fall a little bit in March because they cut the value - added tax , ” Miguel Octavio , head of research at BBO Financial Services in Caracas , said in a telephone interview .
“ But that does n’t mean inflation will slow for long .
It ’s temporary , it ’s a one shot deal . ” …
Octavio , who called the central bank ’s 12 percent target “ unbelievable ” given the 3.7 percent inflation the country racked up in the first two months of the year , doubted the government ’s measures .
“ These things attack the effects of inflation , not the origin of the problem , ” he said .
“ Unless the government announces it ’s going to start spending less tomorrow , I do n’t know what they ’re talking about . ”
Hmm …
The answer is to stop printing money to cover your overspending …
I only wish our own politicians would figure that out .
* Okay , so most economists do n’t regularly use “ D’UH ” in their vocabulary .
For a native New Yorker mounting a first bid for national office , Rudolph W. Giuliani has shown an impressive ability to raise money in Texas , where his Republican presidential campaign collected $ 2.2 million in the first quarter of the year , far more than any other candidate .
Mr. Giuliani has drawn support from Texans who were notable donors to President Bush , including a former Enron president , Richard D. Kinder , and business executives who direct many of the nation ’s oil , gas and energy producers .
And a good part of this success , analysts say , stems from his affiliation with a well - established and politically connected law firm that is based in Houston and bears his name , Bracewell & Giuliani .
That affiliation adds to Mr. Giuliani ’s personal wealth but also could pose political risks for him .
The firm is perhaps the nation ’s most aggressive lobbyist for coal - fired power plants , heavy emitters of air pollutants and carbon dioxide , a gas associated with global warming .
Environmentalists say the firm played a significant role in persuading the Bush administration to roll back major provisions of the Clean Air Act .
But whatever the outcome , the tiff has served to highlight the power and privileges enjoyed by the heirs of creative artists .
They may have no artistic talent of their own , but they bask in reflected glory , receive royalties and determine how works are interpreted or exploited .
In the European Union , as in most copyright protection in the United States , inherited “ moral rights ” last for 70 years after the death of the artist , so the greats of the more distant past are open to all sorts of license .
A Shakespeare play can be updated to the American South , a Mozart opera can be set in Trump Tower , Marcel Duchamp can add a mustache to the image of Mona Lisa — and no one can object .
But when it comes to writers and artists who have died since 1937 , legal heirs , not always direct descendants , have the last word .
In the visual arts disputes often arise when an image is used commercially without permission .
Thus the Picasso estate spends a lot of time trying to chase down the illegal use of Picasso drawings or paintings on everything from coffee mugs and T - shirts to posters and prints , while simultaneously selling his name for use on the Citroën Xsara Picasso car .
René Magritte poses a different problem .
Although his Surrealist images are also reproduced without authorization , more often they inspire advertising images , like figures floating in the sky borrowed from the bowler - hatted men in “ Golconda . ”
But when an idea , not an image , is lifted , it is not protected by copyright .
Salvador Dalí ’s extraordinary imagination is no less plagiarized , but he got ahead of the game by commercializing his own images to the point that André Breton turned Dalí ’s name into an anagram , Avida Dollars .
And if fake Dalís abound , it is also because he is said to have signed hundreds of blank sheets of paper before he died in 1989 .

Scientists at Purdue University have developed an excellent simulation of the Jet colliding with the World Trade Center twin towers on 9 /11 / 2001 .
This computer simulation supports the findings of a federal agency that the impact of the crash defied the power of the crucial fireproofing material , which initiated the fire and that the weakened towers collapsed under their own weight .
The animation should help builders to build safer building .
Fireproofing must be made stronger than now .
Will lessons be learned ?

The United States Senate joined the House today and passed an Iraq War spending bill that includes a timetable for withdrawal of American troops :
The Senate today gave final approval to a $ 124 billion war spending bill that requires troop withdrawal from Iraq to begin by Oct. 1 , with a goal of ending U.S. combat operations there by next March .
President Bush has pledged to veto the bill , and White House spokeswoman Dana Perino promised this morning he would act “ very soon . ”
The Senate approved the measure by a 51 - 46 vote , a day after the House passed the bill by 218- 208 , brushing aside weeks of angry White House rhetoric and veto threats .
“ It is time to end the loss of American lives and to begin to bring our soldiers home , ” Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) said on Senate floor this morning .
“ For the sake of our troops we cannot repeat the mistakes of Vietnam and allow this to drag on long after the American people know it ’s a mistake . ”
Today ’s vote completes work on the rarest of bills : legislation to try to end a major war as fighting still rages .
Democrats hope to send the measure to the White House on Monday , almost exactly four years after President Bush declared an end to major combat in a speech aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln .
That would be a particularly pungent political anniversary for Bush to deliver only the second veto of his presidency .
The problem is that , just as Bush ’s landing on the Lincoln and standing below the “ Mission Accomplished ” banner was a purely political stunt , this spending bill is also a purely political stunt .
The Democrats know that the President is going to veto this legislation and it ’s fairly obvious that they do not have the votes to override the veto .
As I ’ve noted before , this leaves the Democrats with two alternatives .
Either they refuse to pass any supplemental war funding bill at all , meaning that money to fund the war will run out sometime in July .
Or , they take the timetable language out of the bill ( or turn it into a “ suggestion ” that either side can do with what they wish ) and use the President ’s veto as a political tool in 2008 .
As I ’ve also noted , it seems clear that while the public wants the war to end , they do n’t support withholding funds from the troops while they are still there fighting .
Given this , it ’s clear that what the Democrats are engaged in here is a purely political stunt and they will blink at some point in the future .
That does n’t mean it ’s a dumb move politically , of course , but they should at least be honest about what they ’re doing .
EFF sued the FBI in April for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request about the misuse of NSLs as revealed in a Justice Department report .
This week , more evidence of abuse was uncovered by the Washington Post , and EFF urged the judge Thursday to force the FBI to stop stalling the release of its records on the deeply flawed program .
" The reports we 've seen so far about NSL abuse are just the tip of the iceberg , " said EFF Staff Attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" FBI officials told the Washington Post that there have likely been several thousand total instances of misuse .
Americans deserve answers about this scandal and how the FBI has abused its power to spy on ordinary citizens . "
Under the PATRIOT Act , the FBI can use NSLs to get private records about anyone 's domestic phone calls , e-mails and financial transactions without any court approval -- as long as it claims the information could be relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation .
Without a judge 's oversight , the law is ripe for the abuse that has been uncovered in these recent reports .
" The law itself is the source of the problem .
It 's time for Congress to repeal these expanded NSL powers and protect Americans from this abuse of authority , " said Hofmann .
The judge 's order requires the FBI to process 2500 pages of NSL - related records by July 5 , and then 2500 pages every 30 days thereafter .
For the judge 's order :

Could one judge 's decision in a copyright case broadly rewrite US laws governing legal discovery ?
The EFF and the Center for Democracy & Technology are both warning that a recent legal decision could eliminate privacy on the Internet and impose massive record - keeping burdens on any company that uses computers .
Two weeks ago , a judge ruled that BitTorrent search engine Torrentspy was required to enable server logs and turn the information over to the MPAA as part of the discovery process ( the MPAA is suing Torrentspy for contributing to copyright infringement ) .
That ruling was based on the theory that the information in question is already stored in RAM and therefore already exists ;
Torrentspy would not actually need to log any new data , just record what was already passing through its servers .
The legal implications of this argument are staggering , and two technology groups have just pointed them out to the court in a new amicus brief .
In the filing , the EFF and CDT say that the judge 's decision " would mark a radical expansion of the scope of federal electronic discovery obligations ...
Virtually every business in the United States relies on digital technologies for all kinds of communications .
And virtually every function carried out by those technologies depends on and results in the temporary creation of RAM data that is not ordinarily retained . "
If the ruling stands , companies might be forced to archive any potentially - useful information that appears in a PC's RAM or face the prospect of penalties if they are sued and cannot produce the data .
Beyond creating a massive new data retention requirement ( imagine how this could affect an organization with 20,000 workstations and a host of servers ) , the ruling could threaten online privacy .
Many organizations purposely do not retain information such as the IP addresses of visitors , even though this information is available to them and passes through RAM .
If the current order stands , not logging this information could become legally hazardous if such groups are ever involved in lawsuits .
The controversy centers on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34 , which talks about producing " electronically stored " information .
The EFF and CDT argue that " as a factual matter , because information held only in RAM is not stored , but rather exists only temporarily until overwritten , RAM data does not fall within the scope of Rule 34 . "
That is , RAM was never intended to count as " stored " information under the rule .
The EFF 's Fred von Lohmann attempts to illustrate how absurd the new requirement could be by making a comparison to the analog world .
" A court would never think to force a company to record telephone calls , transcribe employee conversations , or log other ephemeral information , " he said in a statement .
" There is no reason why the rules should be different simply because a company uses digital technologies . "
The EFF and CDT are fighting to have the judge 's discovery ruling in the case overturned .

“ Demography is Destiny ” …
It ’s been a common quote on the political landscape throughout the post war era ; often credited ( with no primary sources to back it unfortunately ) to French mathematician and social scientist / philosopher ( and totalitarian socialist to boot – what a combo ) Auguste Comte .
Comte , charmingly , also penned “ Love as a principle and order as the basis ; Progress as the goal ” to support his totalitarian socialist views ( which was later shortened to “ Order & Progress ” to become the motto of Brazil – and part of the justification for their death squads ) .
Much more euphonious than “ From each to his abilities , to each to his needs ” eh .
At any rate , and disregarding the dictatorial delusions of a 19th century Frenchman ; there ’s a strong point to be made with the statement .
To the extent that human behavior is predictable ( and on the macro scale , it can be surprisingly so ) , or more to the point that societies and subcultures behaviors are predictable ; the primary factor in those predictions is demographics .
Of course that is so , because demographics is specifically the study of ones ( or ones “ group ” ) position in society ; social , economic , religious , political ; and how that is likely to effect the actions and decisions of those similarly grouped .
In fact , in many ways demography is specifically the study of how people can be broken into groups of ( at least somewhat ) predictable behavior .
I know personally two demographic experts , who happen to be married to each other ; Kim and Connie Du Toit .
Connie uses her expertise in determining the best way to train corporate workers on a large scale ( like the entire workforce of a fortune 500 company in India ) ; and Kim uses it to design retail store environments ( where to locate stores , what merchandise to sell in what stores at what locations , and where to put it in the store ) for maximum sales .
So , given that Kim is a demographic expert ( and believe me , he is … actually THEY are .
They can talk about the subject for hours ) ; the fact that he was gobsmacked by this piece that he linked is somewhat surprising :
Heinsohn is not concerned with the absolute size of populations , but rather with the share of teenagers and young men .
If this share becomes too big compared to the total population , we are facing a youth bulge .
The problem starts when families begin to produce three , four or more sons .
This will cause the sons to fight over access to the positions in society that give power and prestige .
Then you will have a lot of boys and young men running around filled with aggression and uncontrollable hormones .
And then we shall experience mass killings , until a sufficient number of young men have been eradicated to match societyâ€™s ability to provide positions for the survivors .
According to Heinsohn , 80 per cent of world history is about young men in nations with a surplus of sons , creating trouble .
This trouble may take many forms â€ ” a increase in domestic crime , attempts at coups dâ€ ™Ã©tat , revolutions , riots and civil wars .
Occasionally , the young commit genocide to secure for themselves the positions that belonged to those they killed .
Finally , there is war to conquer new territory , killing the enemy population and replacing it with oneâ€™s own .
But , as Heinsohn emphasizes again and again , the unrest and the violent acts caused by youth bulges have nothing to do with famine or unemployment .
In his book he describes it as follows : â€œThe dynamic of a youth bulge â€ ” it can not be emphasized too often â€ ” is not caused by a lack of food .
A younger brother , who may be employed as a stable hand by the first - born son and who may be well fed and perhaps even fat , does not seek food but position , one that can guarantee him recognition , influence and dignity .
Not the underweight but rather the potential losers or the dÃ©classÃ© are pushing forwardâ€ ( p. 21 ) .
And thatâ€™s just part of the prelude .
The rest , and the analysis itself , will leave you slack - jawed with astonishment , I promise you .
Itâ€™s not often I read something which makes me smack my head ( figuratively speaking ) and exclaim , â€ Of course !â€ , but this analysis managed that quite easily .
Itâ€™s one of those pieces which grabs all the little loose ends lying around in your brain , and ties them all into a big , tidy knot .
And , if heâ€™s right , we are facing some really interesting times aheadâ € ” in a bad sense .
Oh he ’s definitely right ( Heinsohn that is ) .
Astute China and India watchers have been saying for years “ watch out for the demographic bomb ” .
China and India both have a vastly disproportionate share of young males to young females due to sex selective abortion and infanticide .
Combine that with huge and growing populations , and little opportunity for upward mobility ; and it does n’t take a genius to see trouble on the horizon .
The middle east , which has comparatively few opportunities for position and advancement in comparison to it ’s huge population of young males ( also due to cultural sex selection , though there is less infanticide and almost no abortion – females are simply not allowed to be active members of society ; combined with active neglect and plural marriage , the pool of available women is very small ) , has been going through this for it ’s entire recorded history ; and the problem is only accelerating .
There are only two ways to defuse the bomb :
The first is to provide more opportunities for status , position , and advancement ; the second , to reduce birth rates , especially of males .
America has done both quite successfully , providing consistent year over year growth in excess of it ’s population , while bringing birth rates down to replacement levels through organic cultural incentives ( not through population control policies , which simply do n’t work as intended , in fact creating demographic bombs as above ) , and allowing relatively moderate immigration ( in fact our primary demographic issue in the US is assimilated illegal immigration ) .
Europe quite frankly has not done either very well ( and the mid-east has n’t done anything at all except get worse ) .
Since the 1970s ( after the post war recovery and then economic boom – also largely caused by demographics )
Europe has only provided modest opportunities for relatively small percentages of it ’s population , while reducing their birth rates far too drastically .
This population implosion has required Europe to import unskilled labor in massive amounts ; thus resulting in nearly the same problems that exist in the mid-east : large numbers of low status young men , with little opportunity for advancement , little attachment to the political and social fabric of the society in which they live ( or rather which they live outside of but conterminous with ) , and a strong incentive towards violence .
Europe cannot decrease their birth rate ( it ’s already well below the replacement rate ) , in fact they need to INCREASE it ( some governments are already offering incentives to do so – they do n’t work well either ) ; and if they stopped importing labor they would have a total economic collapse ; which would simply accelerate the descent into violence that has already begun in France , Sweden , Germany , Denmark , and the Netherlands .
They are desperately trying to stave off the problem with their welfare state , but they do n’t understand , it ’s not about hungry people , it ’s about people who feel like they have no way of getting ahead .
People who have little self worth and a burning desire to feel important ; and no way of doing so .
Those people are rife for recruitment into radical religious and political sects ; because they give an inflated sense of self worth , and accomplishment ; as well as giving people with excess of energy and aggression ( the definition of angry young men ) goals that they can expend that aggression on .
Oh , and I should note , Americas OTHER major demographic problem is also an excess of young men in an area of little opportunity , with a lot of excess anger and energy , and a lack of self worth and self respect : we call them gangs .
In many ways you can see much of the radicalism of the middle east as one giant street gang , sucking up the angry young men and using their energy to do violence on others .
The only way that Europe is going to solve this problem is by allowing opportunities for advancement and growth to ( excuse the bad reference it ’s sure to create in your head ) explode .
The only way they could do that would be to drastically reduce their regulatory and tax burdens : to remove the negative incentives and allow the positive incentives to grow and take over .
… but they wo n’t do that .
Europes choice is economic freedom , or bloody revolution ; and yet somehow they seem to think the only way to avoid the blood is through LESS freedom , thus they are accelerating the problem .
They are married to an ideology of government control , and nannyism .
This is ultimately an ideology that is incompatible with the aggressive side of human nature , and one that will eventually explode ( and not very far off unless I miss my guess terribly ) .
They believe that somehow , making sure everyone is fed and has a place to sleep , will make everything alright .
Of course they do this by taxing everyone into penury ; at the same time regulating the productive down to nearly nothing , and reducing competition … it ’s more “ humane ” after all … which eliminates jobs or reduces them to meaningless time serving .
Combined with legislating low work hours , minimum wages , and protectionist markets …
They ’ve eliminated both real work , and competition almost entirely .
In the process they ’ve eliminated all of the opportunities for people to advance socially and economically ; and to EARN self worth and self respect .
People need to have some way to earn self respect ; it ’s not something that can be given to them .
In fact attempting to do so makes the problem worse .
If you ’re given everything , you value nothing , including yourself .
People do n’t just want to be warm and safe and fed and “ equal ” … oh I know , for some it ’s enough , for a while anyway ; but man is a competitive and aggressive beast by nature , and blood will eventually out … people want to strive , and excel , and fight , and win .
You ca n’t win , if they do n’t let you play .
Some 460 suspects are believed to be being held at Guantanamo Bay
The panel voted 15 - 9 to back a milder bill , which Mr Bush has vowed to block .
Ex-Secretary of State Colin Powell backed Republicans opposing the measure sponsored by Mr Bush that would allow military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay .
Correspondents say the split within the party risks damaging its prospects in November 's mid-term elections .
The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
Colin Powell
The White House wants the new Guantanamo tribunals to maintain the right to use evidence obtained through coercion and to keep elements of prosecution cases secret from those accused .
But the senators argued that Mr Bush 's proposals would effectively redefine the Geneva Conventions to allow harsh treatment of detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay camp in Cuba .
They said their own version would provide fair trials and meet the demands of the US Supreme Court , that struck down Mr Bush 's original plan .
Four Republican senators joined opposition Democrats on the Armed Services Committee to approve their measure .
The rebels include three prominent senators , John McCain , John Warner and Lindsey Graham , who say Mr Bush 's bill would do further damage to America 's moral authority .
Surprise intervention
The senators are also worried about White House efforts to reinterpret Article Three of the Geneva Conventions in order to allow tougher interrogations of suspects .
KEY SUSPECTS Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( above left ) : Alleged mastermind of 9/11 ; believed to be the number 3 al - Qaeda leader before he was captured in Pakistan in 2003 Abu Zubaydah : Alleged link between Osama Bin Laden and many al - Qaeda cells before his capture in Pakistan in 2002 Ramzi Binalshibh ( above right ) :

Profiles of the 14 suspects Quelling critics Q&A : CIA secret prisons
The article in question governs detainee treatment ; banning torture , violence and degrading treatment - and demands that the sick and wounded are cared for .
Senators ' arguments have been joined by former secretary of state Colin Powell , who said in a letter that redefining the conventions would put US troops at risk .
In an intervention that appears to have taken the White House by surprise , Mr Powell wrote : " The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism . "
His comments were made public as President Bush made a rare personal visit to Congress in order to lobby on behalf of his bill .
Speaking afterwards , Mr Bush said the stakes were high .
" If there 's not clarity , if there 's ambiguity ... the programme wo n't go forward and the American people will be endangered , " he said .
Trial plans
Congress has two weeks to reach a compromise before it goes into recess ahead of November 's mid-term elections .
Correspondents say that if it does not , the status of Guantanamo inmates will remain in limbo - and the Republican split on national security may make it harder for candidates to campaign on an issue they had hoped would be a vote - winner .
The split comes a week after Mr Bush announced plans to resume military tribunals , which were stopped in June .
If Congress approves Mr Bush 's plan , the Pentagon 's chief prosecutor said suspects including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged architect of the 11 September 2001 attacks , could go on trial within months .
The US Supreme Court has ruled that Mr Bush does not have the authority to order such trials , but left the way open for the president to seek Congressional approval for their resumption .
SHINANOMACHI , Japan ( Reuters ) - Japanese motorists may one day pump their cars full of sake , the fermented rice wine that is Japan ’s national drink , if a pilot project to create sake fuel is a hit with locals in this mountain resort .
The faces of people are reflected on a hybrid vehicle that runs on petrol mixed with ethanol made from rice as the vehicle is refuelled with ethanol near a small test plant in Shinanomachi , central Japan May 11 , 2007 .
Japanese motorists may one day pump their cars full of sake , the fermented rice wine that is Japan 's national drink , under a government - funded project unveiled in a snow - capped mountain resort on Friday .
REUTERS / Toru Hanai
The government - funded project at Shinanomachi , 200 kilometres ( 124 miles ) northwest of Tokyo , will produce cheap rice - origin ethanol brew with the help of local farmers who will donate farm waste such as rice hulls to be turned into ethanol .
“ We want to present the next generation a preferable blue print -- a self - sustainable use of local fuels , ” said Yasuo Igarashi , a professor of applied microbiology at the University of Tokyo who heads the three year project .
If the project catches on with locals then it could pave the way for similar endeavours across Japan that will see Japanese cars running on Japanese - made biofuels in the future , he added .
Japan , the world ’s second largest gasoline consumer after the United States , is entirely dependent on crude oil imports and it has been hit by the surge in oil prices .
With hefty carbon emissions reduction targets to meet under the Kyoto protocols , Japan is turning to biofuels .
Yet motorists in Japan are still far behind drivers in Europe and the United States in their consumption of green fuels .
Some analysts say Japan is at a major disadvantage as high prices for local farm produce mean locally - made green fuels are exorbitantly expensive .
Added to that is a lack of support from the country ’s powerful oil distributors and a failure by the government to provide policy incentives such as mandatory usage .
That is where Igarashi and his team come in .
They hope to show that biofuels are feasible and inexpensive by developing a low - cost fuel and encouraging a local community of about 10,000 people to take part in producing that fuel .
SWEET AROMA OF BIOFUELS
Production has just begun at the facility at a former high school field in Shinanomachi and a sweet , sour aroma , similar to that of unfiltered sake , wafts into the air .
“ We like the idea , ” said Shigehiro Matsuki , the mayor of Shinanomachi .
“ The new fuels are renewable ... instead of fossil fuels which are running out . ”
Unlike spacious sugar cane plantations in the No.1 ethanol exporter , Brazil , family farming is dominant in Japan , with a majority of farmers working regular jobs and growing rice , the staple food , on their weekends .
There is plenty of potential to develop biofuels from agriculture waste and abandoned farmland , Igarashi said .
The project will test its biofuel on a “ flex - fuel vehicle ” , which can run on any mixture of gasoline and green fuels and which is gaining popularity in the rest of the world as the battle against global warming heats up .
But Japan has no flex - fuel vehicles even though Japanese car companies Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp. produce them for the market in Brazil .
So the team imported a red Ford Focus from Britain for the project .
With one 1 kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) of rice needed to produce 0.5 litre of ethanol , the main challenge will be creating a low cost biofuel that can compete with ordinary gasoline , which is now sold at around 135 yen ( $ 1.13 ) a litre , including gasoline related taxes of some 56 yen .
by Shaun Boyd
Two people I know just lost their day jobs .
One of them is in her late 20s , and the other is in her 50s .
Regardless of their age difference , they are both recently unemployed , and are thus facing the same frightening question :
The default reaction is to start looking for a new job .
This makes sense .
After all , when you have a job you feel safe .
You become acquainted with your routine of going to work and receiving a steady paycheck .
So even when the job is stressful , unfair , or not enjoyable , you can always feel safe by reminding yourself : “ It ’s a paycheck . ”
Wait a minute — this makes sense ?
Selling yourself into indentured servitude just to feel safe make sense ?
Strong emphasis on the word feel because you ’re not actually safe — not when your supposed safety zone can be vanquished with the simple phrase : “ You ’re fired . ”
I know what you ’re thinking — that wo n’t happen to you .
You ’re good at your job .
You ’re a hard worker that ’s been with the organization for umpteen years .
They ’d be crazy to get rid of you .
In other words , you feel safe .
Fact of the matter is , layoffs are n’t always made as a result of employee evaluations .
Budget cuts , downsizing , buyouts and outsourcing are all circumstances that are economic , not personal — meaning your job is at risk even if you ’re a model employee .
I ’m certain that the two people who just lost their jobs imagined it would never happen to them , because while still employed , both of them suggested I apply to work for their respective employers .
It ’s as if they felt sorry for me that I am unemployed , and wanted to help me by reaching out and including me in their safety zone — as if they were saying “ Come on in Shaun , it ’s safe here . ”
Although I appreciated their kind gestures , I declined .
I had my own plans , and working for someone else did n’t mesh well with them — I wanted to work for myself .
LifeReboot.com is currently my only source of income .
Some days I make as little as ten cents .
Other days I make between five and ten dollars .
I ca n’t pretend that I am unconcerned about finances — but I will proclaim that I am happily unemployed .
In other words , it feels empowering to be responsible for my own earnings .
When I fail to publish new content to my blog , I notice a definite decrease in my site revenue .
On the other hand , if I manage to write a popular article then my site revenue naturally increases .
By choosing to work for myself , I am made responsible for my own fate .
Admittedly , it ’s challenging to accept this responsibility .
If I fail , then it will be my fault .
Consequently , I do n’t always feel safe , I occasionally become discouraged , and the difficult path I have chosen often intimidates me .
By the same token , fear can be a powerful motivator .
Since I do n’t want to face that feeling of self - induced failure , I ’m determined to succeed .
Being faced with a feeling of self - induced failure is probably the primary reason people are so anxious to work for someone else .
What else could cause them to so willingly seek out jobs where they ’re overworked , underpaid , and / or miserable ?
“ To feel safe ” is not a valid reason for me anymore .
I ’d imagine someone that ’s had the unfortunate experience of being unexpectedly fired would feel the same way — but I ’ve learned that ’s not true .
The so - called need to “ get a real job ” has become so standard that people are evidently blind to alternatives , even after you ’d expect them to have learned the hard way .
Fact of the matter is , there are alternatives , and if you ’re courageous enough to embrace your inner genius and follow your life ’s calling , you ’re bound to find your own non-standard path of living .
If you ’re still not convinced , or need help determining your life ’s calling , then I encourage you to read :

Talk to any critic and you ’ll hear about a book you must read — often one you were begged to read by some reviewer when it came out , but which quickly slipped off your radar .
Such is the plight of critics .
Which is why we decided , with the help of the National Book Critics Circle , to ask professional critics ( and some other writers ) to pick the best under - the - radar book of the past ten years or so .
We sought out novels , but a few memoirs popped up .
And though we ’d never have presumed to forecast the results , we did expect some consensus and certainly one clear winner — a buried genius everyone agreed was primed for a Roberto Bolaño–style resurrection .
We were delightfully foiled .
These picks were idiosyncratic , contentious ( that writer ’s underrated ?
Really ? ) , with no two alike .
Until one novelist surged ahead to victory — garnering a whopping two votes .

David Markson ,
for The Last Novel and Vanishing Point
David Markson , who has long been a writer other writers go gaga over , got more votes than any other novelist ( that would be two — and not even for the same novel ) .
As Sarah Weinman of Galley Cat notes , in singling out his just - released novel , The Last Novel , “ Markson writes both in a postmodern fashion , all but the barest of phrases stripped away , and in a widely expansive method to reveal a greater sum of the world around him and all of us . ”
Wayne Koestenbaum highlighted an earlier book by Markson , Vanishing Point : “ It ’s a novel , yes , but it barely qualifies — it ’s simply a list of outrageously pathetic facts about artists and writers .
It ’s funny , sad , bravura , minimalist .
I adore his work . ”

Most of the high profile neocons are just wild about Teddy .
Not the perpetually inebriated one from Massachusetts but the other one — the New Yorker , FDR ’s cousin Teddy Roosevelt .
To understand why , one must understand that the bedrock political belief of neoconservativism is the oxymoronic notion of " limited but energetic government , " as David Brooks described it in the Winter 1998 issue of American Experiment Quarterly .
So - called national greatness conservativism " insists that while government should be limited , it should also be energetic , " Brooks and William Kristol nonsensically stated in a Sept. 15 , 1997 Wall Street Journal article .
So government must be big , yet small .
Unlimited , yet limited .
Energetic , yet lethargic .
This is the neoconservative philosophy of government in a nutshell .
In a September 25 , 2004 Weekly Standard article the self - described " godfather " of neoconservativism , Irving Kristol , explained that his heroes are " Teddy Roosevelt , FDR , and Ronald Reagan . "
Roosevelt , who the neocons affectionately label " TR , " is listed first because of the belief that " energetic " government was " given new life by Teddy Roosevelt , " as Brooks stated in his 1998 article .
Even Steve Forbes , who sometimes postures as a libertarian , " has embraced Teddy Roosevelt , " says Brooks .
( Forbes is also a Lincoln idolater .
Not surprisingly , Bill Clinton once said that Teddy Roosevelt was his " favorite Republican president " ) .
Understanding the real Teddy Roosevelt is therefore important if one wants to understand the mindset of the warmongering imperialists who control the Republican Party ( and the federal government ) today .
The truth is , Teddy Roosevelt was an imperialist who was morbidly fascinated with war and killing .
He was a died - in - the - wool statist who considered himself to be the political heir to Hamilton , Clay , and Lincoln .
He was a reckless , frenetic interventionist who displayed little knowledge ( especially on economic issues ) or even concern about the likely consequences of his interventions .
TR ’s mental stability was questionable , to say the least .
Mark Twain , who met him twice , judged that he was " clearly insane , " as Tom Woods recalls in an essay on Roosevelt in Reassessing the Presidency ( John Denson , editor ) .
In biographies of TR we learn that after an argument with his girlfriend a young Teddy Roosevelt went home and shot his neighbor ’s dog .
When he killed his first Spaniard in Cuba he " abandoned himself to complete hysteria , " as biographer Edmund Morris recounts .
As president Roosevelt would take morning rides through Rock Creek Park wildly shooting at tree branches with a pistol , oblivious to the harm he might do to the nearby private homes in the District of Columbia .
He once strung a wire across the Potomac River so that he could hang on it because , he said , his wrists needed strengthening .
Far more important than Teddy Roosevelt ’s insane antics , however , is his misbehavior as president , which was a disaster for the nation .
The reasons why are catalogued in a new biography entitled Bully Boy : The Truth About Theodore Roosevelt ’s Legacy by Jim Powell .
It was TR who first declared that the U.S. should act as the world ’s policeman , a dramatic contrast to George Washington ’s and Thomas Jefferson ’s policy of commercial relations with all nations and entangling alliances with none .
Consequently , writes Powell , " the United States has become involved in dozens of wars , and hundreds of thousands of American soldiers have died in wars that had little , if anything , to do with U.S. national security . "
Here you have the principal reason why the neocons are just wild about Teddy .
Roosevelt warned of " the menace of peace , " and was subsequently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize !
" His many targets [ for war ] over the years included Cuba , Hawaii , Venezuela , China , the Philippines , Panama , Chile , the Dominican Republic , Nicaragua , and Canada . "
He always masked his imperialistic impulses with humanitarian rhetoric , says Powell , in the dishonorable tradition of the Party of Lincoln .
The U.S. could n’t admit that it was seizing territory simply because it wanted it , for example , so " he asserted that the United States must intervene . . . when a nation failed to behave . "
This was a philosophy of unlimited foreign policy interventionism , not unlike the Bush administration ’s claim to be busy eradicating evil from the planet .
TR was " the most outspoken advocate of an interventionist foreign policy " and lusted for war and killing .
The more the better .
The reason for this , Roosevelt once explained , is that " All the great masterful races have been fighting races . . . " Master Race . National Greatness Conservativism .
What ’s the difference ?
Powell shows how TR reinvigorated the imperialism of the early Republican Party , especially of the activities of William Seward , Lincoln ’s secretary of state .
To show just how imperialistic the late nineteenth - century Republican party was , Powell quotes historian Warren Zimmerman as explaining how Seward " wanted to push the United States north into Canada , south into Mexico , and west toward Asia .
In the Caribbean he sought a coaling station for the U.S. Navy in the Dominican Republic , signed a treaty with Denmark for the purchase of the Virgin Islands , and won the agreement of Columbia for the right to build a canal across the Isthmus of Panama .
He also made . . . probes at . . .
Cuba , Haiti , Culebra , French Guiana , Puerto Rico , and St. Bartholomew .
He courted Denmark for both Iceland and Greenland . "
Powell describes how , as an assistant secretary of the Navy in the McKinley administration , Roosevelt helped manipulate the media and Congress into declaring war with Spain .
Unlike today ’s cowardly cheerleaders for war ( William and Irving Kristol , Rush Limbaugh , G. Gordon Liddy , Sean Hannity , New Gingrich , William Bennett , and most of the employees of the American Enterprise Institute , Heritage Foundation , Weekly Standard and National Review magazines come to mind ) , TR did volunteer to participate in the war , and he did so in Cuba .
He did have the courage to put his own life at risk .
His famed " rough riders " experienced a 70 percent casualty rate during their brief Cuban adventure , after which " Roosevelt . . . lobbied aggressively to have himself awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor . "
( His efforts failed , but he was awarded the medal posthumously by an admiring President Bill Clinton ) .
Powell does a good job of describing the opponents to Rooseveltian warmongering imperialism , namely , the Anti-Imperialist League , whose members included Grover Cleveland , Mark Twain , Andrew Carnegie , and William Graham Sumner .
Roosevelt dismissed all of these men as " men of a bygone era . "
Teddy Roosevelt became president by first serving as William McKinley ’s vice president and succeeding him after he was assassinated .
One of his first proclamations was that the Filipinos " must be made to realize . . . that we are the masters . "
( There ’s that master race notion again ) .
He referred to Filipinos as " Chinese half - breeds , " " savages , barbarians , wild and ignorant people . "
Having demonized and dehumanized Filipinos in this way , under his " leadership " the U.S. military would kill more than 200,000 of them .
" Torture became an accepted method of prompting Filipino villagers to disclose what they knew about the identity of guerrilla leaders , " writes Powell , in a statement that must give chills and thrills to modern - day advocates of torture like Rush Limbaugh .
( At a recent Heritage Foundation function Limbaugh thanked some of the actors from the television show " 24 " for " making torture respectable " ) .
Being largely ignorant of economics and economic history , the neocon TR worshippers also praise him for his " trust busting " activities .
Powell surveys the economics literature on Teddy Roosevelt ’s celebrated " trust busting " and shows how this Quixotic crusade was a matter of using the blunt force of the state to punish and intimidate many of the most competitive businesses and industries in America , to the benefit of their less efficient ( or sour grapes ) competitors .
It promoted protectionism , not competition .
While proclaiming himself to be a champion of the consumer Roosevelt supported the Republican party ’s hyper - protectionist tariff policy , inflicting even further harm on hapless American consumers .
No friend of the consumer could embrace protectionism as Teddy Roosevelt did .
Roosevelt also crippled the U.S. railroad industry by signing the " Hepburn Act " which allowed the Interstate Commerce Commission to impose price controls on railroads , all but outlawed volume discounts to large freight customers , and regulate almost all other aspects of the railroad business .
The result was a flight of capital away from the railroad industry that was a serious drag on the entire economy for decades , writes Powell .
" TR " also drummed up a phony " food safety crisis " in order to heroically " save " America from it .
But as Powell shows , " there were no epidemics related to commercial food processing " in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .
Roosevelt ’s " pure food laws " were aimed " at protecting producers , " not the general public .
For example , as Powell recounts , some of these early laws set exceptionally high regulatory standards on imported foods as a form of veiled protectionism .
Food inspection laws during the Roosevelt era were invariably favored by larger corporations who understood that the laws would disproportionately harm their smaller competitors .
" The 1906 Pure Food And Drugs Act empowered the Agriculture Department ’s notorious quack , Harvey Washington Wiley , to conduct crazy crusades against foods competing with the interest groups he served " ( mostly larger corporate interests ) .
Teddy Roosevelt is also remembered as a " great conservationist " but in reality his " conservation " policies were another disaster .
" In the name of conservation , " writes Powell , " Theodore Roosevelt squandered huge amounts of money and degraded much of our natural environment .
He launched a federal dam - building program that flooded canyons , disrupted natural water flows , silted up waterways , raised water temperatures , lost huge amounts of water through evaporation , and increased the salinity of irrigated soil so much that very little could grow on it .
Roosevelt ’s national forest policies contributed to overgrazing of grasslands and to forest fires of unprecedented ferocity . "
Socialists of all stripes praise TR’s " conservation " policies , nevertheless , because he strenuously opposed the privatization of government - controlled land .
Private property is the mortal enemy of socialism .
In reality , TR’s " conservation " policies were just another Republican party mercantilist scheme .
Mostly western " lobbying groups hoped to enrich themselves with . . . free dams , free waterway improvements , cheap water , cheap timber , cheap access to grazing lands , and other goodies , at somebody else ’s expense . "
Teddy Roosevelt ’s biggest sin was that he " revived the idea of a federal income tax after it had been given up for dead . "
In doing so , the Philadelphia Record editorialized , " Roosevelt provided more encouragement to state socialism and centralization of government than all the frothy demagogues have accomplished in a quarter century . "
Having jump - started the crusade for the nationalization of all income , TR ’s successors Taft and Wilson finished the job .
Wilson would use the government ’s newly - created riches to finance America ’s disastrous entry into World War I .
This is yet another reason why the neocons are just wild about Teddy .

When doctors diagnosed cancer and told John Brandrick that he had less than a year to live , he resolved to make the most of the time he had left .
The 62 - year - old council worker quit his job , sold his car , stopped paying his mortgage and dug into his life savings so he could treat himself and relatives to expensive restaurant meals .
He even sold all his clothes but for the black suit in which he expected to be buried .
A year later , however , with no sign of the Grim Reaper coming to call , he went for tests - which gave him a clean bill of health .
He had never had cancer at all .
Yesterday the divorced father of two said he faces having to sell his home to rescue his finances and is considering suing the hospital which mistakenly gave him a death sentence .
" We have nothing at all , " he said at his home in Newquay , Cornwall .
" It 's put me and my family through hell . "
Mr Brandrick 's ordeal began in February 2005 when he began suffering severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed with jaundice .
An ultrasound scan at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Treliske revealed what was thought to be a two - inch tumour on his pancreas .
That April , a letter from his consultant to his GP gave the bombshell news : " The clinical diagnosis is pancreatic cancer .
His life expectancy is six months .
" The cancer is progressing .
I am sorry to relate that John suffers from such a serious condition .
Certainly his life expectancy is less than 12 months . "
" It was so scary , " Mr Brandrick said yesterday .
" Being told about your own demise is the most awful thing in the world .
" It 's not something any of us think we 'll hear .
We all hope to die of old age . "
Mr Brandrick decided his priority was to spend time with his partner of 16 years , Sally Laskey , which is why he gave up work , sold his car and stopped paying the mortgage .
Even his winter clothing was given to charity shops as he did not expect to need it again , and the couple went for trips around Cornwall and to visit relatives .
" It felt like I was on Death Row , " he said .
" I got rid of everything , all the bric - a - brac around the house , the lot .
I just kept my burial outfit - a black suit , white shirt and red tie .
" We loved going to restaurants .
We paid £ 80 for meals , things Sally and I were unable to afford normally . "
In all , they spent thousands of pounds treating themselves as well as friends and relatives .
Finally a scan this year revealed the " tumour " had disappeared .
Further tests showed he had been suffering from pancreatitis - a non life - threatening inflammation of the pancreas .
It emerged that a biopsy taken soon after the original diagnosis had given him the all - clear but the result was blamed on a sampling - error .
A second test which would have confirmed the finding was never done .
" It was such a relief , " Mr Brandrick said yesterday .
" But that wrong diagnosis has left me in financial ruin . "
He and his partner , a 55 - year old receptionist , are now selling their £ 280,000 house and considering suing the Royal Cornwall for compensation .
A spokesman for the hospital insisted its staff had done everything they could to identify Mr Brandrick 's condition correctly .
" While we do sympathise with Mr Brandrick 's position , a clinical review of his case has not revealed that any different diagnosis would have been made at the time , based on the same evidence . "
As more and more workers who inhaled the dust at ground zero fall ill , it has become increasingly clear that much of the problem can be traced to the Giuliani administration ’s failure to insist that all emergency personnel and construction workers at the site wear respirators .
The then - mayor and his agency heads put their emphasis on a speedy cleanup and return to normalcy .
In that , they were remarkably successful , clearing the site in less than 10 months .
Unfortunately , the price is now being paid by thousands of workers who have developed lung and other ailments .
The evolution of this tragedy was described by Anthony DePalma in The Times and other analysts .
In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the twin towers , it was understandable that emergency workers would rush in in hopes of rescuing victims , and hang the precautions .
But as rescue operations turned into a search for remains and then debris- removal , workers continued to ignore warnings from both city and federal officials that respirators should be worn at the site .
There was some understandable delay rounding up enough of the recommended respirators .
But there was no excuse for a lag in fitting the respirators to individual faces and training the workers to use them .
The more fundamental problem was that many workers hate to wear respirators because they can be uncomfortable and inhibit talking .
There was also a certain macho disdain , especially when authorities were putting out mixed messages about the safety of downtown air .
T here are these things .
These unholy events called " Purity Balls " and you should probably fall to your knees right this minute and thank a merciful and lubricious and happily polyamorous
God that you do not know what they are and that you have access right this minute to vast quantities of wine to deflect their nasty karmic arrows because , you know , oh my God .
But hey , free country .
Purity Balls .
No , not some sort of newfangled spherical chastity device to be inserted using vacuum tubes and pulleys , but rather fancy creepy dress - up rituals taking place in towns like Colorado Springs and Tucson and Zoloft Jesusville , in which Christian dads rent a bad tux while their daughters , mostly teenagers but many as young as 6 or 7 , get all dolled up in gowns from JCPenny and they all drive out to the airport Marriott and prepare to , well , lose their minds .
It begins .
At some point the daughter stands up , her pale arms wrapped around her daddy , and reads aloud a formal pledge that she will remain forever pure and virginal and sex - free until she is handed over , by her dad ( who is actually called the " high priest " of the home ) , like some sort of sad hymenic gift , to her husband , who will receive her like the sanitized and overprotected and libidinously inept servant she so very much is .
Praise !
Would that I were making this up .
The dad -- er , high priest -- in turn , stands up and reads his pledge , one stating that he will work to protect his daughter 's virginal purity that he has so carefully and wickedly drilled into her since birth , since she was knee - high to a disturbing dogma , that he will protect her chastity and oversee it and help enforce its boundaries , which might or might not involve great amounts of rage and confusion and secret stashes of cheap scotch , although his pledge claims it's with honor and integrity and lots of bewildering Godspeak .
Which , in many households , is essentially the same thing .
It 's true .
Purity Balls are happening , right now .
And yes , you have heard this all before .
Particularly from the conservative Right , especially from America 's rigid and pale fundamentalist " core . "
Premarital sex is evil .
Female sexuality must be , as ever , contained , repressed , shoved deep down lest it tempt men to sin like gleeful pagans licking ice cream from the pierced nipples of the devil .
Girls do not know how to handle their own genitalia and therefore must be taught -- by their fathers , no less -- how to dilute their sexual power in order to attract a sexually unqualified , God-fearing husband .
You know , same as it ever was .
Very well .
Let us now trace the path of imminent cultural destruction : Virgin girl has zero experience with the joys of her own body , with orgasm , with men , with sex toys or shower heads or good gynecological gizmongery .
She then marries a man who will very likely have not the slightest clue ( as he has had the same dreadful sexual miseducation as our fair virgin ) as to what to do with a woman 's body , who will , by most all accounts , be unable to tell an erogenous zone from an elbow , a clitoris from a belly button .
Voilà , the standard recipe for emotional , physical and spiritual catastrophe , for roughly 17 years of vague marital misery capped off by divorce and much therapy and four unhappy children and the profound and aching need located somewhere deep beneath the pelvic bone to try something , anything new and different and sexually liberating .
Let 's just say it outright :
The superiority of virginity myth , it is a massive , underreported disaster .
It is a ridiculous and exhausting misconception that must be eradicated like a cancer .
Perhaps French philosopher Voltaire said it best , nearly 300 years ago : " It is one of the great superstitions of the human mind to have imagined that virginity could be a virtue . "
So true .
Which is another way of asking , Do n't we have it exactly backward ?
Should n't one 's overall happiness -- physical , marital or otherwise -- be directly equated with exceptional amounts of sexual training and education and awareness ?
Is such positively libidinous education not a recipe for health and well - being and long - term marital satisfaction ?
You already know the answer .
Look , the plague of sexual incompetence plagues our land like a plague .
It infects our schools , our popular culture , our presidential administration .
The right endorses wanton sexual stupidity ( and all ensuing miseries , drug addictions , divorces , stresses , gun fetishes , online porn obsessions ) through failed abstinence programs , STD misinformation , refusal to support quality birth control and the relentless repetition of lies about sin and depravity and a shocking ignorance of the transformative spiritual power of sex .
Purity Balls ?
Nothing but a sad celebration of that exact ignorance .
No wonder over half of all teens who take any sort of virginity pledge end up breaking the ridiculous vow within a year ( says a new Harvard study ) , and fully 88 percent end up having sex before marriage anyway .
What 's more , such silly pledges only result in more oral and anal sex among teens who try , vainly , to adhere .
They also marry younger , have fewer sexual partners ( read : less skill ) and yet have exactly the same rate of STDs as kids who are smart enough to avoid such pointless pledges in the first place .
Would that we had a new agenda , a sexually informed education system that truly empowered teens , that taught open - minded respect for bodies and flesh , pleasure and joy and physical / spiritual awareness .
Sure , include STDs and appropriate birth - control information , but not as a deterrent , not as some sort of nasty weapon of fear .
Rather , arm your virgin daughters and inept sons with slick and giddy reverence for the joys of the flesh , for its potential to transform and ease tension and make you realize all is not so wrong and sinful and hateful with the world .
Would we not be utterly transformed ?
Would we not finally be free of the sneering , churlish mentality that somehow thinks virgins are dumb , immaculate prizes to be won ?
Let 's just say it :
There is no sacredness in the virgin .
There is only the fear , were she to be educated and empowered and really let loose , of what she could become .

Counterfeiting
Is not Terrorism
This is a surreal story of someone who was chained up for hours for trying to spend $ 2 bills .
Clerks at Best Buy thought the bills were counterfeit , and had him arrested .
The most surreal quote of the article is the last sentence :
Commenting on the incident , Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey told the Sun : “ It ’s a sign that we ’re all a little nervous in the post - 9/11 world . ”
What in the world do the terrorist attacks of 9/11 have to do with counterfeiting ?
How does being “ a little nervous in the post - 9/11 world ” have anything to do with this incident ?
Counterfeiting is not terrorism ; it is n’t even a little bit like terrorism .
EDITED TO ADD ( 5/30 ) : The story is from 2005 .

In a forthcoming Virginia Law Review paper , entitled " The Piracy Paradox : Innovation and Intellectual Property in Fashion Design , " two law professors investigate how the fashion industry manages to thrive despite rampant copying of clothing designs .
The paper 's authors , Kal Raustiala of the University of California , and Chris Sprigman , start by observing that the fashion industry has what they term a " low - IP equilibrium , " in which clothing designs enjoy almost no copy protection and designers frequently turn large profits by copying each others ' work .
In spite of the lack of IP protection for clothing designs — or rather , because of this lack , the authors argue — the fashion industry remains vibrant and profitable , exhibiting none of the negative effects on creativity that advocates of strong intellectual property ( IP ) rights would predict in the absence of government - enforced monopolies on creative " content . "
Part of the overall reason for undertaking this investigation of the fashion industry is to question the standard assumptions about the relationship between intellectual property laws and incentives to create that underly all of modern intellectual property law .
The standard theory goes that if a creator 's exclusive right to profit from the distribution of her work is not protected by law , then creators will lose the incentive to create , as " free riders " drive down the price of the work by filling the market with copies .
This theory may hold true for books ( the original " intellectual property " of Renaissance IP debates ) , inventions , and music , but it 's apparently a poor fit for the fashion industry .
If it were n't for widespread copying of clothing and accessory designs , there would be no such thing as a " fashion trend . "
The fashion industry , it seems , has settled into a relatively stable state ( an equilibrium ) in which a large amount of intellectual property " piracy " effectively drives the market .
Note : I 'm going to keep putting the word " piracy " in those annoying scare - quotes because it's a terrible term for IP infringement .
If pirates hijack a shipload of cannonballs in the Mediterranean , then the owners of that shipment are now short a few tons of cannonballs .
If I download a copy of a song from a P2P service , then the owner of that IP may be out some money ( assuming I would otherwise have bought that track elsewhere ) , but they 're still in possession of the IP for the song ; I have n't taken anyone 's property from them , and it's not even clear that I 've cost them any money if I would n't otherwise have purchased the track .
Infringement , though illegal and possibly costly to an IP owner , does not equal piracy or theft , and the misuse of the term in this paper is unfortunate .
Anyway , Raustiala and Sprigman locate the roots of the fashion industry 's successful low - IP equilibrium in two factors : induced obsolescence and anchoring .
Induced obsolescence
Because clothing is closely tied to status , especially in the realm of fashion , every design eventually becomes obsolete ( i.e. it goes out of style ) when it loses its ability to confer status on the wearer .
When is something well and truly out of style ?
When everybody is wearing it , and that 's where the open nature of fashion copying helps drive the fashion market .
The authors write :
As Miucci Prada put it recently , " We let others copy us .
And when they do , we drop it . "
The fashion cycle is driven faster , in other words , by widespread design copying , because copying erodes the positional [ ed : or " status - conferring " ] qualities of fashion goods .
Designers in turn respond to this obsolescence with new designs .
In short , piracy paradoxically benefits designers by inducing more rapid turnover and additional sales ...
What was elite quickly becomes mass .
So rampant , unauthorized copying drives the fashion cycle , and in doing so it spurs designer creativity ; this is the opposite of what the standard assumptions about the relationship between unauthorized copying and incentives to create would predict .
It 's important to include the authors ' caveat about the importance of trademark law in this scheme .
A genuine Prada purse confers more status than a Prada knock - off , so designers must protect their trademarks aggressively , even if they do n't protect the designs to which those marks are attached .
Anchoring
The second phenomenon that Raustiala and Sprigman identify at the root of the fashion industry 's low - IP success is what they call anchoring .
Anchoring describes the process by which the industry converges on a few major design themes , or trends , during a fashion season — whether skirts are fitted or flowing , or cuffs are wide or slim , and so on .
Anchoring is also the mechanism by which the fashion industry signals to consumers that trends have changed , and it 's time to update the wardrobe .
While the industry produces a wide variety of designs at any one time , readily discernible trends nonetheless emerge and come to define a particular season 's style .
These trends evolve through an undirected process of copying , referencing , receiving input from consultants , testing design themes via observation of rivals ' designs at runway shows , communication with buyers for key retailers , and coverage and commentary in the press .
Copying helps to anchor the new season to a limited number of design themes , which are freely workable by all firms in the industry within the low - IP equilibrium .
A regime of free appropriation helps emergent themes become full - blown trends ; trendy consumers follow suit .
Anchoring thus encourages consumption by conveying to consumers important information about the season 's dominant styles : suits are slim , or roomy ; skirts are tweedy , or bohemian ; the hot handbag is small , rectangular , and made of white - stitched black leather , and so forth .
Thus anchoring helps fashion - conscious consumers understand ( 1 ) when the mode has shifted , ( 2 ) what defines the new mode , and ( 3 ) what to buy to remain within it .
So unrestrained copying not only drives the production of new designs by making older designs obsolete , but it also helps shape the new designs around themes so that consumers can easily identify what looks are " in " or " out " at the moment .
What does this mean for Big Content 's crusade against peer - to - peer copying ?
Probably not much , at least in the near term .
The two phenomena identified above are at the very least peculiar to markets involving " positional goods , " and may well be peculiar to the fashion industry in particular .
The models developed in the paper are n't really that generalizable to other IP regimes , and the authors acknowledge as much .
Nonetheless , the paper may be a good first step in moving beyond traditional , blanket assumptions about the relationship between copying and innovation , and it may spur legal scholars to develop more detailed models of intellectual property that fit specific industries .
The paper also suggests that when technological and market conditions change dramatically , as they have in the wake of the P2P revolution , the relationship between unauthorized copying and incentives to create may change dramatically as well .

Water can cause the brain to swell A Californian woman has died after taking part in a water - drinking contest , but why is too much water dangerous ?
We are regularly advised to drink more water : it clears skin , reduces tiredness and aids concentration .
But the death of a woman in the US after taking part in a water - drinking contest shows you can have too much of a good thing .
Jennifer Strange had taken part in the " Hold Your Wee for a Wii " game , which promised the winner a Nintendo Wii .
Afterwards she reportedly said her head was hurting and went home , where she was later found dead .
Initial tests have shown her death is consistent with water intoxication .
Drinking too much water can eventually cause your brain to swell , stopping it regulating vital functions such as breathing , and causing death .
So what happens ?
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A feature to the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
Water enters the body when we drink and is removed primarily in the urine and sweat .
The amount of water in the body is regulated to control the levels of certain compounds , such as salt , in the blood .
If you drink too much water , eventually the kidneys will not be able to work fast enough to remove sufficient amounts from the body , so the blood becomes more dilute with low salt concentrations .
" If you drink too much water it lowers the concentration of salt in your blood so that it is lower than the concentration of salt in cells , " says Professor Robert Forrest , a consultant in clinical chemistry and forensic toxicology at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield .
Confusion
The water then moves from the dilute blood to the cells and organs where there is less water .
Professor Forrest likens this to the effects seen in science - class experiments .
Actor Anthony Andrews was treated for water intoxication in 2003 " If you put salty water on onion skin the cells will shrink , if you put too much water on it the cells will swell , " he says .
This swelling is a problem in the brain .
" When the brain swells , it is inside a bony box so has nowhere to go , " he says .
" The pressure increases in the skull and you may get a headache .
As the brain is squeezed it compresses vital regions regulating functions such as breathing . "
Eventually these functions will be impaired and you are likely to stop breathing and die .
Warning signs included confusion and headaches .
Symptoms would normally occur very soon after drinking the water , but if the gut is absorbing the water more slowly then it can take longer .
Drinking several litres over a relatively short period of time could be enough to cause water intoxication .
Those most at risk include people taking ecstasy , as the drug increases thirst and facilitates the release of anti-diuretic hormones so more water is taken in but can not be excreted .
Also , elderly people because their kidney function may be impaired .
Treatment for drinking excess water is " relatively straightforward " , says Professor Forrest .
It includes giving patients diuretics to help decrease their water load , or using drugs to reduce the swelling caused by excessive water .
Hot
He says the real problem is diagnosis .
Because patients can be very confused they are often mistakenly thought to have taken drugs .
Ursula Arens , of the British Dietetic Association , says water is essential for a variety of bodily functions , for example to excrete waste products such as urea .
We lose water all the time and so need to replace it and in normal circumstances should aim to drink about one and a half litres every day , she says .
During hot weather or exercise more should be consumed as dehydration can lead to bad breath , tiredness and a higher risk of bladder infections .
" If you are going to the toilet more than once every two hours or so that might be too much , especially if your urine is clear , " she says , but adds that drinking too much water is unusual .
Below is a selection of your comments .
A partner of mine was a nurse , and I remember him telling me over 20 years ago that " The poison is the dose " .
This death illustrates the truth of that statement as clear as a bell .
Stephen Watson , Brighton , UK I believe that when drinking too much water , the water is absorbed into the red blood cells which causes them to swell also , so if there is too much water , there is a possiblity that the red blood cells will explode .
Bob , East Grinstead
I recently looked this up on web to find out how much water an adult should drink per day .
The problem was that some sites , like the above report , say to drink 1.5 litres per day , whilst others say 2 , 2.5 or even 3 litres per day .
All recommendations appear to have been made by experts so who should we believe ?
Very confusing ?
Mike Griffiths , Clydebank - Scotland
What has happened to this poor lady ( and her family ) is an absolute tragedy .
Water intoxication is something that many people pooh - pooh as nonsense , but here is absolute proof it exists .
Some of the deaths attributed to class a drugs , such as ecstacy have also been caused by the deceased having taken in too much water , but no - one believes it can be true , because water can only be ' good for you ' .
This Jennifer Strange , all for the sake of some new , five minute , flash in the pan , toy ... for God 's sake .
Rest in peace .

Yet another person harmed due to their own greed and the event coordinators stupidity .
There have been a number of cases similar to this such as the person who got third degree burns after sitting on ice for money as well as the woman who got her forehead tattooed as part of a competition .
All trying to get something for nothing ...
Sam , Guildford , Surrey A needless and tragic death of a young mother , all for a video game ?
Tragic .
Jenny , Dublin , Ireland Ironically , long distance runners have to be careful of drinking too many fluids ! ; the feeling of thirst does indicate de-hydration , but serious athletic performance can mislead you .
Holding in fluids for several hours can cause confusion , headaches and is detrimental to athletic performance .
Several marathon runners have died to due over consumption of fluids .
Richard Elliott , Bradford I just guess as the saying goes " too much of everything water inclusive is bad " keep up the good work
tijani sadiq , lagos , nigeria Tragic , as these cases always are , but also a clear warning to people not to be so stupid !
Nothing that we can and do ingest is good for us in unlimited quantities - surely that should be clear to everyone .
Sadly , it appears not to be .
Water is so innocuous , so normal , so recommended .
Yes , but do n't people ever ask WHY they have to drink water ?
I suppose none of the reported victims had ever bothered to think about why we need water .
D. Fear , Heidelberg , Germany
It is curious how the message has crept into society that one needs to drink four litres of water a day .
I am sure this has been put out by the bottled water industry .
In a temperate climate like the UK , the body 's own regulatory system easily copes with fluid balance and forcing extra water into the body is useless and maybe detrimental .
Bob Gardiner , Kirkbymoorside
This is really shocking .
My brother joined the Para 's last year and as part of one ofthe ' beasings ' he got during the training period , was for the guys to drink as much water as possible .
They drank water until and after they were sick where they were standing !
This knowledge should be more widely spread .

Tom Taylor , Warrington , UK Did the people running this stupid contest know this ?
Should there not have been health warnings to the contestants ?
theyre close to murderers if there was't , i sincerly pray for the poor woman who wanted the gameconsole that everyone seems to own .
Capitalism at its best and love to her family at this time .
The preponderence of lawyers around no doubt will help them work in a court of law against the contest runners .

It 's a problem that does n't really attract the attention it deserves .
The same problem happens if you sweat a lot or have the runs , and fail to replace the sodium or other vital minerals in your body .
Hence why we have rehydration fluids , and not just water !
Ed , London Jeremy , London I was told to drink 3 litres a day to flush out kidney stones .
This was very hard work though I was told that this was the best way to get rid of them
michael blake , Plymouth England
There is so much misinformation about water intake here in the US , and you see people walking around with their personal water bottles everywhere !
For example , everybody seems to repeat the " eight cups a day " mantra [ a US cup is 8 fl. oz. ] , even people who should know better !
In fact you need about 8 cups * including the water you get from your food * .
For most people that means about only 4 to 6 cups of liquid are needed ( even apparently dry foods like bread contain some " free water " ) -- so leave the sippy cups at home if you are over 4 years old , OK ?
Another big myth is that caffeinated drinks do n't count -- also not true .
Coffee , tea and coke do have some diuretic effect but you should still count them as about half to two - thirds their actual volume .

Given the very sound scientific knowledge upon the risk of drinking too much water in a short period of time as clearly explained above , the Californian authorities should consider prosecuting the organisers of the contest for not ensuring that participants were fully informed and adequately looked after .
Richard Little , Cambridge
Interestingly , marathon runners have known about the risks of drinking too much water for a while since there were a few deaths on the marathon circuit of people who had drunk too much water during the marathon itself .
People were loading up on water before the marathon and assuming that they would sweat out the excess water during the marathon in order to avoid dehydration .
The problem during a marathon is not one of high water levels but really one of low sodium levels .
The heat generated by the body during exercise naturally makes the runner sweat , but the sweat contains high levels of salt which is not replaced in the body by drinking water either before or even during the race .
This is the reason that all marathons now offer sports drinks , that contain salts and minerals to replace the sodium / magnesium / potassium that is sweated out during the race .
So sports drinks that advertise themselves as being isotonic are not just gimmicky but serve a very real purpose .

This is all really confusing .
We have always been told that drinking lots of water is good for us and that it is good if your urine is clear but now we are being told that is actually a bad thing .
I recently read that if you are thirsty , you are already dehydrated so you should drink enough that you do n't get thirsty but this may mean you are drinking too much .
While this sort of tragic accident seems to be the exception and not the rule , it is very scary that something that seems so benign like drinking lots of water can be deadly .
Mel Low , London , UK " If you are going to the toilet more than once every few hours or so that might be too much , especially if your urine is clear , " Well that means every time I have a few pints why I behave so strangely .
I thought I was drunk , but it must be water intoxication !
Joe Delaney , Ladbroke Grove , London " If you are going to the toilet more than once every two hours or so that might be too much , especially if your urine is clear , " This is also a symptom of Diabetes , excessive urination coupled with excessive thirst .
If this does occur get checked by a doctor , do n't wait
Mike Abbott , Kettering
Is it known exactly how much water this woman drank in this contest ?
Obviously drinking ample water IS a good thing , but I 'm curious as to how much this woman consumed in order to die ; as I 'd imagine it would have to be huge quantities to cause such a lethal effect to her circulatory system .

A few weeks ago I found a weird little sideline in the project I was working on that I decided to explore for a while and it drew me inexorably towards a subject that I ’d never even thought about before – American State Flags .
It ’s quite difficult to trace the path that brought me to these symbols – I was exploring some ideas around editorialising flat - termed folksonomies , trying to gett a generic word and giving it some kind of personality .
Many words with competing meanings do n’t really fit this kind of activity very well , but US States seem to handle this kind of stuff relatively easily ( or at least , there ’s pretty clearly a dominant meaning for most of them , even if there are multiple meanings ) .
I imagine I ’m losing most of you .
As I said , it ’s hard to explain .
Anyway , I ’d decided that I wanted to explore ways of representing US States visually , and the most obvious way to do that is to use the map of the state or an outline of it ’s shape .
But finding a coherent way of representing states as outlines within a fixed width space without them all being massively different heights or radically different scales ( or just looking dull ) seemed impossible .
So I found myself looking at State flags as a way of representing some of the colour and personality of the places – and they are extraordinary .
There ’s enormous variety – a complete range of styles from the classically - influenced through to the almost corporate .
Some are high quality bits of design work , some are very much not .
Some seem bounded by traditions of Heraldry , while others appear to have been knocked up drunkenly in a backshed a hundred years ago .
I imagine outside America most of these flags are completely unknown .
So I thought I ’d go through a few of my favourites in alphabetical order and do a bit of a clumsy design critique upon them .
The pictures that follow are all from Wikipedia and I should probably say before I start that my comments are not designed to be about the states themselves , just their flags , so please do n’t lynch me , people of Nevada …
This is the State Flag of Arizona , the stripes apparently representing the original thirteen colonies of the US in conquistador colours with the copper star representing the state ’s copper mines .
I ’m sort of puzzled by it – it ’s kind of weirdly evocative , but there ’s something very wrong about that star in the middle .
It looks muddy and confusing to me .
Perhaps it ’s a bad reproduction .

I hope I ’m not about to offend anyone by saying that the flag for Arkansas ( the winner of a 1911 design competition , subsequently revised over the next fifteen years ) reminds me of the label of a sardine can .
It ’s a resolutely puzzling piece of design work – laden with stars distributed semi-assymetrically and apparently at random ( there is meaning to them , but it ’s a fairly forced meaning ) .
I would say this was not an enormous design triumph for the state , and – given how new the flag is – quite possibly up for a redesign .

Now I have to say I pretty much love the California State Flag , even though it does n’t really seem to me to particularly capture the spirit of the state that I know .
It ’s clearly reasonable solid on design grounds , but I think it ’s history gives it a character that some other state flags do n’t have .
A much much simpler version of the flag was first flown during the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma ( a beautiful town I ’ve visited a few times on online community business ) .
The revolt came about when U.S. Army Captain John C. Fr√©mont persuaded the locals that the current Mexican government of California was about to attack them .
Years later a revised version of the flag was adopted by the State .
The original flag was in fact only flown for a couple of weeks before being replaced by the flag of the United States by officials of that power .
However , the flag survived up until the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and in pictures appears to be a hand - crafted , rather clumsy but quite beautiful piece of cloth .
The current design is a quite substantial reworking of that flag .
Both versions feature the bear , which apparently was nicknamed Cuffy by Midshipman John E. Montgomery .
As a composition it seems to me to be pretty solid – the red stripe at the bottom gives a flag - like feel and a grounding to the work – with the star at top left balancing it all pretty successfully .
The bear has been pretty well stylized and the grass does n’t seem too forced .
It ’s all pretty solid .
Even the font on the flag seems to fit quite well .
American state flags seem to have an unusual amount of writing on them .
Normally it ’s a disaster – but not here .
In fact the only thing I ’d say about the flag that troubles me a bit is that its revisions from the original have maybe left it a little too airbrushed and carefully branded .

I ’m going to stick my neck out now and say that I think Colorado ’s state flag is the worst flag of all the US States , and I ’m going to put this down squarely at the doors of design amateurism .
Apparently none of the colours or the shape of the ‘ C ’ were fixed by the legislature for decades after its original creation .
Bad branding !
I ’d fire that particular agency in a moment .
There ’s also an alarming lack of meaning to the thing .
The blue apparently represents ‘ sky ’ ; the white , ‘ snowcapped mountains ’ ; the red , ‘ earth ’ and the yellow represents the sun .
If it was n’t for the ‘ C’ , therefore , this flag could cheerfully be used to represent pretty much any country in the entire world .
In fact , to me it looks more like a bad corporate logo – perhaps for Carolco or something – than a State flag .
Bad form , Colorado .
Very disappointing .

In terms of bizarre flags , Hawaii takes the biscuit .
The flag officially predates most of the states in America itself and in its semantic cross - breeding gestures towards some of weird compromises in the state ’s history – apparently representing an attempt to hybridise the flags of the UK with the US .
That Hawaii still flies a flag with the Union Flag of Britain in the top left corner is – frankly – a bit weird .
And given that the Union Flag is already rather overloaded with design elements and meaning ( being itself a hybridisation of the flags of England , Scotland and Ireland ) , Hawaii never really had a chance …

Among the people I ’ve shown it to , the flag of Maryland triggers really dramatically different responses .
Some find it headache - inducing , but I absolutely love it .
In design terms at least it ’s totally distinctive and stark and sort of beautiful .
Historically , it ’s a bit more troubling – apparently being based upon the heraldic banners of George Calvert , 1st Lord Baltimore .
There ’s a twist though – originally only the gold and black elements were used for the flag until the Civil War , when secessionists chose to represent themselves under the red and white colours .
After the Civil War , the flag was changed to represent both halves of the struggle .

This is the flag of Mississippi .
It is , I think , rather a clumsy design effort centred around the ‘ stars and bars ’ of the Confederate flag .
The square in the corner is clearly a different aspect to the flag itself which makes the thing look inbalanced – particularly with the diagonal lines in it .
The white surround to the square confederate design is also a design compromise to allow it to sit next to the red bar without a weird bleed .
It ’s just clumsy clumsy clumsy .
In 2001 a replacement was proposed which replaced the Confederate cross with a series of circles of stars .
The replacement was – I think – a significant improvement – disposing of the diagonals for one – and looked more balanced and mature .
It ’s still far form a beautiful bit of work , but that ’s sort of irrelevant since the replacement flag was firmly rejected by politicians of the time .

The flag of Nevada troubles me a bit , mainly because of the large slogan , “ Battle Born ” stuffed unceremoniously in the top - left hand corner .
This is supposed to reflect that the state was created during the Civil War , but seems to me to be the kind of thing that could encourage your citizenry to confuse aspirations of solidarity with violence towards outsiders .
Seems to me that flags should help you aspire to something rather better than fighting .
Design - wise it struggles with fonts and writing like so many of the US State Flags , but at least it does so more discreetly than some of the others .

Now this is a classy flag – simple , elegant , modern and reflecting the history and people of New Mexico .
Or at least so it would appear at first glance .
The symbol in the middle is a sacred symbol of the people of the Zia pueblo and represents the Sun .
That would probably make you think that the flag was a sensitive representation of the indigenous peoples of New Mexico .
Unfortunately , given that the indigenous peoples of New Mexico are desperately trying to get their symbol off the flag , that ’s probably not the case .
Still in design terms , I think it ’s a triumph – simple , elegant , stark clean colours suggesting the atmosphere of the place .
All very interesting and well put - together .

Now this is a strange one – the flag of South Carolina – that I ’ve put up mainly because of the weird associations that it triggers in my mind .
At first glance it seems like a picture of a palm tree and a crescent moon , and I ’m afraid that immediately triggers thoughts of Middle Eastern flags to me .
I ’m not the only one , it seems .
In terms of symbolism there are a whole bunch of articles online about how the crescent moon came to be associated with Islam .
I ca n’t quite imagine South Carolina as an Islamic state though .
A little more digging reveals that it ’s supposed to represent not the moon , but some form of neck armour .
Problem solved , albeit in an odd way .

And my final selection is the flag of Texas .
It ’s difficult to know what to say about this flag , except that it ’s solid , representative , strong and pretty much perfect for the state it represents .
It ’s not flowery or over - designed , it has blunt and solid symbolism ( blue reflects loyalty , white reflects strength and red , bravery ) .
As such , despite the other more florid , elegant or stylish flags from around the country , I have to say that I think this is the most successful .

If you ’ve enjoyed this tour around some of the strangest and best of American State Flags , you should really explore them all on Wikipedia ’s Flags of the US states page .
You ’ll notice that there ’s a wide tradition of flags with scenes in their centre and latin proverbs .
Unsurprisingly these represent most of the older and eastern states of the US .
Of the flags I ’ve not talked about , I think perhaps Alaska is my favourite .

Bush ’s Top Ten Mistakes in Iraq during the Past 4 Years
10 . Refusing to fire Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld when his incompetence and maliciousness became apparent in the growing guerrilla war and the Abu Ghraib torture scandal .
9 . Declining to intervene in the collapsed economy or help put Iraqi state industries back on a good footing , on the grounds that the “ market ” would magically produce prosperity effortlessly .
8. Invading and destroying the Sunni Arab city of Fallujah in November , 2004 , thus pushing the Sunni Arabs into the arms of the insurgency in protest and ensuring that they would boycott the January , 2005 , parliamentary elections , a boycott that excluded them from power and from a significant voice in crafting the new constitution , which they then rejected .
7. Suddenly announcing that the US would “ kill or capture ” young nationalist Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr in spring , 2004 , throwing the country into massive turmoil for months .
6. Replying to Baathist guerrilla provocations with harsh search and destroy missions that humiliated and angered ever more Sunni Arab clans , driving them to support or join the budding guerrilla movement .
5 . Putting vengeful Shiites in charge of a Debaathification Commission that fired tens of thousands of mostly Sunni Arab state employees simply for having belonged to the Baath Party , leaving large numbers of Sunnis penniless and without hope of employment .
4. Dissolving the Iraqi Army in May , 2003 , and sending 400,000 men home , unemployed , resentful and heavily armed .
3 . Allowing widespread looting after the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9 , 2003 , on the grounds that “ stuff happens , ” “ democracy is messy , ” and “ how many vases can they have ? ” – and thus signalling that there would be no serious attempt to provide law and order in American Iraq .
2. Plotting to install corrupt financier , notorious liar , and shady operator Ahmad Chalabi as the soft dictator of Iraq , and refusing to plan for a post - war administration of the country because that might forestall Chalabi ’s coronation .
1. Invading Iraq .
Finally , assuming that total reserves are 175 Gb and that these reserves are produced at a conventional depletion rate of below 5.5 % / year , the oil production rate of Saudi Arabia is forecast to Dec 2020 .
This forecast shows that production follows an exponential decline curve down to 4.5 million barrels / day in Dec 2020 and that it is highly likely that the world 's crude oil and lease condensate production has passed a peak of 74.2 million barrels / day on May 2005 .
Aramco ’s proved reserves are equal to the annual production divided by Aramco ’s definition of annual depletion rate .
Thus , total reserves are equal to 175 Gb ( 3.5 Gb / 2 % ) , which is about half of their stated number of an extremely optimistic 359 Gb .
In 2003 , assume that Aramco could have produced at an average capacity of 9.5 Mb / day for the entire year .
Production reached this level during the Iraq invasion in March 2003 .
The annual production is 3.5 Gb ( 9.5Mb/d*365d *(1Gb/1000 Mb ) ) .
Data from the presentation is used to convert Aramco 's depletion rates into conventional depletion rates which show that conventional maximum depletion rates for Ain Dar / Shedgum , Abaiq and Berri are well above 5 % / yr .
In addition , Aramco 's stated depletion rate for Shaybah shows that Aramco believes that Shaybah has up to 20 Gb total reserves .
In Dr. Saleri ’s Saudi Aramco presentation on Feb 24 , 2004 to the CSIS in Washington , D.C. , he stated that Our typical depletion rate is about two percent .
However , Aramco ’s definition of annual depletion rate is consistently calculated as annual production as a percentage of total reserves .
Aramco ’s calculation method will be confirmed by the examples below .
Definitions
Depletion rate ( rem ) = Common or conventional definition of depletion rate which is annual production as a percentage of remaining reserves ( assumed to be the same as total reserves less cumulative oil reserves produced )
Depletion rate ( tot ) = Aramco ’s definition of depletion rate which is annual production as a percentage of total reserves ( assumed to be the same as initial proved reserves )
Reserves depletion = Cumulative reserves produced as a percentage of total reserves
URR = Ultimate Recoverable Reserves or total reserves
Gb = billion barrels
Mb = million barrels
Saudi Aramco ’s Depletion Rate Calculation Method
Dr. Saleri ’s presentation shows Aramco ’s calculation method for depletion rates .
Figs 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 are sourced from this presentation .
Fig 1 below states in the title that depletion rates are a “ % of Initial Proved Reserves ” which are the same as depletion rates ( tot ) .
Fig 1 – Maximum Annual Depletion Rates ( tot ) – click to enlarge
To check this calculation , Prudhoe Bay ’s maximum depletion rate ( tot ) of 4.2 % / yr is verified .
Here is a chart of Prudhoe Bay ’s production profile .
A total reserves ( or Aramco ’s term of initial reserves ) figure of 13 Gb is used from this source as it is dated 2002 rather than the chart ’s estimated reserves from 2001 .
The maximum depletion rate ( tot ) is equal to the maximum annual production as a percentage of total reserves .
Depletion rate ( tot ) = 0.55 Gb ( years 1980 - 87 )/13 Gb = 4.2 % which agrees with the depletion rate ( tot ) of 4.2 % shown in Fig 1 .
For comparison , in 1993 , the depletion rate ( rem ) was much higher indicating that the Prudhoe Bay field was being produced aggressively .
Annual production was less at 0.4 Gb and cumulative production was 8 Gb. Remaining reserves is total reserves of 13 Gb less cumulative of 8 Gb to give 5 Gb. Depletion rate ( rem ) = 0.4 Gb /5 Gb = 8%/yr .
Fig 2 – Prudhoe Bay
Saudi Aramco ’s Depletion Rates ( rem ) for Selected Fields
Fig 3 shows the reserves depletion of selected fields .
Abu Sa’fah has a reserves depletion of 21 % .
Fig 1 shows Abu Sa’fah ( assumed to be ABSF ) to have a maximum annual depletion rate ( tot ) of 1 % .
From the definitions above , reserves depletion is cumulative reserves produced as a percentage of total reserves .
Depletion rate ( tot ) is annual production as a percentage of total reserves .
Depletion rate ( rem ) =annual production / ( total reserves – cumulative reserves produced ) =1 % ( total reserves ) / ( total reserves – 21 % ( total reserves ) ) .
Abu Sa’fah maximum depletion rate ( rem )
The total reserves variable cancels in the above equation resulting in the depletion rate ( rem ) = 1%/( 100%-21 % ) =1.3 % / yr for Abu Sa’fah , which is a low depletion rate ( rem ) .
Applying the same formula to the other fields :
Safaniya maximum depletion rate ( rem )
Depletion rate ( rem ) = 1.5%/( 100 % - 26 % ) = 2.0 % , still low .
Zuluf maximum depletion rate ( rem )
Depletion rate ( rem ) = 1.8%/( 100 % - 16 % ) = 2.1 % .
Ain Dar / Shedgum maximum depletion rate ( rem )
Depletion rate ( rem ) = 2.2%/( 100% -60 % ) = 5.5 % , this field is being pushed hard .
Abqaiq maximum depletion rate ( rem )
Depletion rate ( rem ) = 2.8%/( 100 % - 73 % ) = 10.4 % , this is very high but this field has been producing since 1946 .
Berri maximum depletion rate ( rem )
Depletion rate ( rem ) = 4.1%/( 100 % - 28 % ) = 5.7 % , this field is being pushed hard .
As shown above , the maximum depletion rates ( rem ) range from 1.3 % to 10.4 % which is more realistic as supported by this statement for Middle East fields from this source .
“ Adopting a depletion rate for Iraq of 4 - 5 % , which is well within good management practice for large fields ” .
Fig 3 – Reserves Depletion – click to enlarge
Fig 4 below shows the actual depletion rate ( rem ) for Aramco , assuming total reserves of 175 Gb .
The actual depletion rate ( rem ) is now between 4 - 5 % .
If the depletion rate ( rem ) is kept below a maximum of 5.5 % , reflective of good reservoir management , then Aramco ’s production will stay below 9 Mb/d and will continue to decline in order to keep the depletion rate ( rem ) below 5.5 % , shown in Fig 7 .
Fig 4 – Actual Depletion Rate ( rem ) – click to enlarge .
Shaybah Field Total Reserves
The figure below is also from Dr Saleri ’s presentation .
The depletion rate ( tot ) is given as 1 % / yr with an optimistic production plateau of more than 50 years .
Fig 5 – Shaybah – click to enlarge
The annual production is 0.5 Mb/d*365d=182.5Mb/yr or about 0.18 Gb/yr. Applying Aramco 's depletion rate ( tot ) of 1%/ yr gives total reserves=0.
18Gb/1%=18
Gb for Shaybah .
This number appears very optimistic next to Colin Campbell ’s figure of 6 Gb reserves for Shaybah , discovered in 1968 , from his book “ The Golden Century of Oil 1950 - 2050 ” .
However , this source agrees that Shaybah might have 18 Gb :
UAE : Saudi Border Oilfield
The UAE and Saudi Arabia are debating the ownership of the border oilfield at Shaybah , which contains nearly 1.5 per cent of the world 's total crude resources .
Discovered in 1968 , the field straddles the UAE - Saudi border and is believed to be one of the world 's largest onshore oilfields , with current estimated proven reserves of 15.7 billion barrels .
Up until 25 December 2003 , the field had yielded one billion barrels , however oil industry sources believe its recoverable oil potential could rise to 18 billion barrels in a few years with the deployment of new technology ( such as horizontal drilling ) .
Fig 3 shows Shaybah ’s reserves depletion to be only 5 % to 1/1/2004 .
Given that Shaybah has produced ( 0.5 Mb/d*365d*5 yr plus 0.2 Mb/d*365d , or 985 Mb ) about 1 Gb to 1/1/2004 , Shaybah ’s total reserves using this calculation is the about 1 Gb / 5 % or 20 Gb .
At least , Aramco ’s data shows consistent optimism within their presentation .
I do not share their optimism and believe that Shaybah ’s reserves are much lower than 18 Gb .
Saudi Aramco ’s Real Reserves
Fig 6 shows a pie chart for Aramco ’s resources .
Based on this chart , the total reserves are 260Gb+99 Gb=359
Gb .
The reserve depletion is cumulative reserves produced divided by total reserves or 99/359 = 28 % , which is equal to the reserve depletion number of 28 % in Fig 3 .
This shows that Aramco ’s presentation data is consistent .
However , what is not consistent on Fig 3 is showing Ghawar ’s depletion at 48 % while Total Saudi Aramco is only 28 % .
Since Ghawar production has been a majority of Aramco ’s total production , the depletion for Total Saudi Aramco should be at least 48 % .
If it is assumed that Aramco ’s total reserves are 175 Gb then the more realistic figure for reserves depletion for Total Saudi Aramco in Fig 3 should be 99/175=56 % .
In 2007 , the cumulative amount produced would be 99 Gb plus 11 Gb from Jan 2004 to Feb 2007 to give 110 Gb produced .
The current reserves depletion is 110/ 175=63 % which implies that future Aramco field production decline rates will accelerate to ensure that depletion rate ( rem ) are kept below 5 % .
As the 260 Gb reserves number is reported in BP ’s annual statistics , and the BP reserves number is supposed to be remaining reserves , Aramco had no choice but to exaggerate their reserves upward to an enormous 359 Gb !
Note that in 1983 when Saudi Arabia nationalised its oil assets , BP stated reserves of 169 Gb for Saudi Arabia .
This implies that a total reserves of 175 Gb is consistent with the 169 Gb number as no giant fields have been discovered in Saudi Arabia since Lawnah ( only 1.2 Gb ) in 1975 .
Fig 6 – Saudi Aramco Discovered Oil Resources – click to enlarge
A comment from Dr Saleri from his accompanying speech to the presentation was Our typical depletion rate is about two percent .
However , to be consistent with the presentation , that means that the Aramco depletion rate ( tot ) = 2%/ yr.
Assume that Aramco could have produced a “ typical ” 9.5 Mb/d in 2003 .
Fig 4 shows that a production level of 9.5 Mb/d was reached during the March 2003 Iraq invasion .
Annual production for 2003 equals 9.5 Mb/d*365d *( 1 Gb /1000 Mb ) =3.5
Gb .
Therefore , using this method , Aramco total reserves equals 3.5Gb/2%=175
Gb , which is about half of their stated number of 359 Gb .
Saudi Arabia Production Forecast
The actual production and depletion rates ( rem ) are shown in Fig 4 above .
Fig 7 shows a forecast of production to Dec 2020 .
It is assumed that Aramco will continue to practice good reservoir management and consequently the depletion rate ( rem ) will not exceed 5.5 % / year .
If the depletion rate ( rem ) is kept lower than 5.5 % , say at 4.5 % / yr , then production rates would probably drop below 8 Mb/d in early 2008 and continue to decline .
The forecast shows clearly that Saudi Arabia having its reserves already 63 % depleted must increase production decline rates to ensure that reservoirs are not damaged .
Themegaprojects shown in the chart are too small to stop the exponential production decline .
The reserves of the megaprojects ' underlying fields are included in the total reserves of 175 Gb .
Furthermore , if the total reserves of Saudi Arabia are truly 175 Gb and Aramco 's production is constrained by keeping the depletion rate ( rem ) under 5.5 % , then the world 's crude oil and lease condensate production is highly likely to already have passed a peak of 74.2 million barrels / day on May 2005 .

I 'm willing to bet that if you are or have been sexually active , you have contracted a disease during sex .
I can think of several times in which I have caught a cold through sexual contact .
I gave strep throat to my college boyfriend days before my symptoms set in .
Twice .
And I 'm not quite sure who to blame for my months - long bout with the Epstein - Barr virus , or EBV , also known as " infectious mononucleosis , " when I was 21 .
Probably myself , but they do n't call it " the kissing disease " for nothing .
Not once did I feel even the slightest twinge of embarrassment about picking up germs through sex .
In fact , at times , I 've felt a bit smug that we had sex despite a cold , or joked about lovemaking being the best treatment for all kinds of ills .
But had I picked up a bug identified as a sexually transmitted infection , suddenly , I 'd have run smack into a cultural wall of shame and secrecy .
I 'm tired of it .
I 'm tired of people treating STIs like they 're some sort of judgment , a whole separate kind of illness .
In fact , herpes and EBV have a lot in common :
Once you have been infected with EBV , your body may periodically shed ( or give off ) the virus throughout your lifetime , possibly spreading the virus to others .
This can occur despite the fact that you do not have symptoms ....
Some newly infected people may not have any symptoms of mono and may not be aware they are spreading the virus .
– ( WebMD )
I 'll carry EBV for the rest of my life and no one gives a damn , even though it 's entirely possible that I 'm passing the virus to young people through sharing utensils or smooching .
That 's not as much of a danger now that I 'm too old to go around French kissing twenty - somethings , but 10 years ago I could have sent a dozen young dot - commers to the hospital , we worked that closely together .
Arguably , herpes is more devastating than mono because it brings a social overhead other viruses do n't .
After all , it is a – cue echo effect – Sexually Transmitted Infection .
Sex educators try to get people to think of STIs as a health issue rather than a moral one , figuring that if we can lift the veil of shame , we can get more people tested and aware and making informed choices about sexual activity .
Just look at the debate surrounding the human papillomavirus vaccination – which ultimately protects women against cancer – to see how shame can get in the way of good health .
SxCheck , which launched this month , is the latest contender in the movement to change how we think about STIs .
It 's a joint project between Stanford graduate student Doug Wightman , 23 , and the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation , or AIM , offering the general public an STI testing service based on one the adult industry has developed over a decade .
AIM made the mainstream press a few years ago when actor Darren James ( NSFW ) returned from a trip to Brazil and tested positive for HIV .
" AIM detected all of the patient 's partners within 24 hours , and found three infections within 10 days , " says AIM founder Dr. Sharon Mitchell .
The partners did n't work or have sex for 60 days until they tested negative two months in a row ; no one else became infected .
AIM was credited with acting quickly and effectively stopping an industrywide epidemic before it began .
The SxCheck process is simple .
You decide which STIs you want to be screened for , order your test online , go to a local blood draw station , and access your results on the website .
It differs from its sister AIMCheck in one way :
Your results are not sent to producers and agents .
It 's not anonymous , as you need to show your ID at the draw station .
But it 's not public , either .
Your results are available only to you , although you can choose to share them if you want to .
Doug hopes you will .
" Rather than people acting reactively toward testing , it now becomes preventative , " he says .
" You can get tested before hooking up , and have your results available digitally when you want to share them . "
Negative test results are available online via digital certificate , while positive results – and what you can do about them – are communicated to you over the phone .
Doug believes that by making STI testing routine , and the results easy to show to potential partners , SxCheck will have a profound impact on social behavior .
" When people come to realize the prevalence of STIs in the general population – about a third of Americans contract an STI by the age of 35 – a certain degree of acceptance will set in , " he says .
" The large and diverse immediate response suggests that people are accepting SxCheck very quickly . "
Doug envisions us embedding HTML in our online dating profiles to share test results and the date of our last screening , and he 's already working on making results accessible ( securely ) by mobile phone .
That makes information available when you need it , without the social awkwardness of carrying a lab slip folded up in your back pocket " just in case . "
Many STIs can be cured if you catch them soon enough .
Yet out of ignorance or fear , many people do n't get tested until it 's too late and they 've already given an STI to others .
" Chlamydia and gonorrhea are very common , but they are also easily treatable .
Same with syphilis , " he says .
" You do n't need to carry a stigma or suffer for life . "
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one out of five Americans have genital herpes , although the rate of infection has dropped in the past few years .
You can't get rid of that one , but you can manage it and significantly reduce the chances of passing it on – if you know you have it .
Coming from the technology and adult industries , the SxCheck team is intimately familiar with issues surrounding confidentiality and sensitive information .
One concern is whether insurance companies or employers will ever have access to what tests we choose , or our results .
No , says Doug , although SxCheck operates under the same constraints as any other health - care organization and test results might have to be disclosed in certain circumstances if required by law .
For example , in California , you might be held liable for passing an STI to a partner , in which case test dates and results might be subpoenaed by the court .
( How this recent case will affect people 's willingness to be tested for STIs is still unknown . )
Otherwise , " we do n't share information with any third parties , " he says .
" We do n't work with insurance companies at all , like other facilities do , so in that sense we are more restrictive . "
Doug sees SxCheck as a perfect opportunity to provide sexual health information within a very personal context : your test results .
Along with information about safer sex practices , he wants to help people whose tests come out positive , offering guidance for treatment and sex - positive health care .
" We do n't want to force anything down anyone 's throats , and by no means are we reinventing the wheel , " he says .
" We want to encourage people to get tested and share their results , to promote dialogue and understanding . "
Funny , that last bit is Sex Drive 's mission too .
See you next Friday ,

Bloody Wednesday : Guerrillas , Violence kill Nearly 300 Iraqis
Well I guess those Baghdad markets are n’t as safe as Senator John McCain thought .
And , they look remarkably unlike small town Indiana this morning , contrary to what Congressman Mike Pence alleged a couple of weeks ago .
The thing about reality and politics is that sooner or later , reality outstrips rhetoric , and then the politics is revealed for the lie it is .
The silly allegation that the guerrillas are only artificially making it look like the surge is falling is another piece of fluffy illogic .
Define “ success ” for the surge , and then measure reality against it .
You could say that it is still early to make a judgment .
You ca n’t say that there is no evidence after 6 weeks for whether progress is being made .
In that regard , the answer is clearly a resounding “ No . ”
Nearly 300 persons were killed or found dead in Iraq on Wednesday and hundreds were wounded .
Al - Hayat writes in Arabic that the smell of blood and gunpowder wafted through Baghdad on Wednesday
In the capital alone , Sunni Arab guerrillas carried out five horrific bombings in Shiite neighborhoods that , with some mortar attacks and shootings , killed around 200 persons and wounded many more .
The morning began with a guerrilla bombing of a police checkpoint at the gate to the Shiite slum of Sadr City , which killed 41 .
Then the terrorists opened the gates of hell , carefully placing high explosives in a Shiite market and detonating them as workers gathered to take minibuses home after a hard day ’s work .
The blast incinerated or tore apart some 140 persons and injured 150 more , according to Reuters .
Al - Hayat says : “ Eyewitnesses said that furious citizens , who busied themselves with collecting bodies charred by the horrific explosion and gathering body parts spread over an area of fifty years , threw stones and the rubble produced by the explosion at a joint American / Iraqi force that came to the market , forcing it to withdraw before this demonstration of popular rage . ”
Peddlers in the market put their wooden trolleys to work as ambulances for the wounded .
There were reports of children being pulled alive from beneath the charred corpses of their relatives .
Later on , the guerrillas set off two smaller bombs , killing even more Iraqis .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ordered the arrest of the colonel in charge of security for the Sadriya Market .
( That may make him feel good , but surely is bad for morale in the officer corps of the new army .
Reprimanding or demoting him would make sense , but arresting him ?
Who would want to serve under such circumstances ? )
Police also found 25 corpses in the streets of Baghdad , victims of death squads and torture .
In Ramadi , authorities found 25 more decomposing bodies on Wednesday ( they had found 17 the day before ) .
In Mosul , police found 9 bodies .
Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports in Arabic that the Baghdad coroner ’s office is reporting a significant uptick in the number of unidentified corpses coming into the Baghdad morgue , especially from the ( Sunni ) Karkh area .
This trend is a reversal of the lower numbers of corpses being found daily in February and March .
McClatchy has more details .
A big nitric acid cache was also found in Baghdad , probably intended for use in bomb making by the guerrillas .
The British turned over security in Maysan Province to local authorities on Wednesday .
The southern , Shiite province , with its capital at Amara , is largely in the hands of the Sadrists .
It is bizarre that the US is fighting them in Diwaniya but the British are handing over control to them in Maysan .
Go figure .
The British have now withdrawn from Muthanna , Dhi Qar and Maysan , three of the four provinces where they initially had security duties .
They are now at a few bases in Basra .
The US more or less turned security in Najaf Province over to Iraqis ( i.e. the Badr Corps paramilitary of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq , which is infiltrated into the police ) .
The al - Maliki government hopes to see security in Karbala turned over next .
Parliament will soon take up the draft oil law passed by the Iraqi cabinet .
The Kurds are insisting on virtual autonomy in awarding petroleum contracts in their areas .
Other parties are concerned that the law potentially gives away too much to foreign oil companies .
On the other hand , the law was drafted by Oil Minister Hussein Shahristani , a nuclear engineer who is close to Grand Ayatollah Sistani , and it is hard to imagine either that he can’t count or that he wants to detract from Iraq ’s sovereignty over its most valuable commodity .
Iraq may have twice as much petroleum as anyone thought , a new study says .
But , none of it will get developed under the current circumstances .
Kuwait is in talks with Iraq over the possible importation of natural gas .
Saudi Arabia has forgiven $ 15 billion in debt owed it by Iraq from the days of the Iran - Iraq War .
Unencumbering Iraq of its massive debts , racked up by Saddam Hussein ’s wars , is key to any hope of eventually ( 10 or 15 years down the road ? ) nursing the country back to economic health .
This step is the first major favor the Saudis have done the al - Maliki government , which Riyadh tends to view with suspicion as a sectarian , Shiite , pro-Iranian affair .
It is further evidence that of all the major regional powers , Saudi Arabia is best placed to play a major role in resolving the Iraq crisis , if only the Americans would step aside and let it .
Scott Harrop on the ridiculous claims in the NYT and the Pentagon of Shiite Iranian arms going to the hard line Sunni Taliban .
Iran is allied to the Hazara Shiite party in Afghanistan , the Hizb - i Vahdat , members of which the Taliban massacred and are still trying to kill .
Yeah , it makes a lot of sense for Iran to arm the Taliban .
Officers I ’ve talked to in the US military are absolutely convinced that Pakistan is behind the neo-Taliban .
For Peter Pace to bring up Iran is just another piece of indirection .
It is one thing to be amused by a magician ’s tricks , it is another to believe they are real .
The second belongs to a category : that of a sucker born every minute .
You let the American Enter - Lies Institute and Michael Rubin lie you into a war with Iran , America , and you will be very , very , very sorry .
Sometimes a small variation on an existing idea is enough to make it stand out .
In October 2006 , when Bessed began its search service with the manually edited results pages , it had only two editors and covered just a few hundred search terms suggested randomly by users .
Last month , another company , Mahalo ( Hawaiian for “ thank you ” ) , inaugurated a search service with manually edited results .
It started with several advantages : venture capital backing , 30 editors , systematic focus on the most commonly requested search terms , and the added idea of supplying Google ’s search results for any search not covered by its own best - of - the - best lists .
Mahalo now has pre-prepared pages for 5,000 terms related to entertainment , travel , health , technology and other subject areas .
The company plans to expand its coverage to 10,000 terms by year - end , and eventually to provide results for one - third of the most common search terms .
The company is financed by Sequoia Capital , which knows something about the search business :
It was an early backer of both Yahoo and Google .
Sequoia , like other Silicon Valley venture capital firms , offers experienced entrepreneurs an office and salary to figure out an idea for a new start - up .
It was while he was an entrepreneur in residence that Jason Calacanis had the inspiration for Mahalo .
Mr. Calacanis , 36 , published The Silicon Alley Reporter in the mid-1990s and went on to be a co-founder of Weblogs , a federation of blogging sites that was sold to AOL in 2005 for about $ 25 million .
He took up residence at Sequoia in December 2006 , founded Mahalo and gathered two rounds of financing , including backing from the News Corporation .
At the end of May , Mr. Calacanis unveiled Mahalo at the D : All Things Digital conference sponsored by The Wall Street Journal .
Mr. Calacanis said he has enough financing to provide five years of experimentation and refinements , but he has not disclosed the amounts .
A hand - built Mahalo search - results page has one conspicuous advantage over Google ’s : grouping into subthemes , which make a page of links much easier to scan and to find items of particular interest .
For example , Mahalo ’s page about Paris Hilton , the site ’s top search subject last week , arranges the recommended links into clusters including news , photos , gossip , satire and humor .
The use of subject categories also eliminates the need to provide , as Google does , two - line text excerpts from the listed sites to provide clues about the site ’s contents .
The Mahalo page about Ms. Hilton lists more than 80 sites .
Each takes up only one line ; grouped by subtheme , they are easier to skim than the 12 sites that fill the entire first page of Google ’s search results .
According to outside estimates , Firefox has about 15 percent of the market , Internet Explorer has more than 78 percent , and Apple ’s Safari a little less than 5 percent .
Mozilla has 90 employees and revenue of more than $ 100 million in the last couple of years .

Mozilla plans to make enough money to keep growing .
But a windfall came in the form of a royalty contract with Google , which , like the other search companies , is always competing for better placement on browsers .
Under the agreement , the Google search page is the default home page when a user first installs Firefox , and is the default in the search bar .
In the last two years , the deal has brought in more than $ 100 million .
( Google has a similar placement with Apple ’s Safari . )
So far , no one has figured out how to balance keeping an open - source or collaborative project fully financed while remaining independent and noncommercial .
Wikipedia , for example , holds occasional fund - raisers , while its leaders debate if it should take steps toward some sort of sponsorship or advertising .
Thanks to the Google agreement , the Mozilla Foundation went from revenue of nearly $ 6 million in 2004 to more than $ 52 million the next year .
The foundation plans to increase its work force , and to add some engineering capability .
In 2005 , the foundation created a subsidiary , the for - profit Mozilla Corporation , also led by Ms. Baker , mainly to deal with the tax and other issues related to the Google contract .
( The foundation ’s 2006 tax return has not yet been made public , but Ms. Baker said the Google revenue will remain about the same . )
She described the decision to align with Google as an organic one that predates the official release of Firefox .
“ We had Google in a beta version for a long time , so we approached them first , ” she said .
Mitch Kapor , who is on the Mozilla board , said that accepting a deal with Google was a no - brainer .
“ Always on my mind , in all my involvement is , how is it going to be sustainable ? ” he said .
“ I am a big believer that begging is not the right business model .
When it began to become clear there was a business opportunity , in monetizing search in the browser , I saw this as a great opportunity . ”
Story Highlights • Mike Huckabee , a Baptist minister , defends biblical creation narrative

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( CNN ) --
During the first GOP presidential debate last month in California , three Republican candidates raised eyebrows by indicating they did not subscribe to Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution .
When the topic came up again Tuesday night in a CNN - sponsored debate in New Hampshire , one of those evolution skeptics , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , offered a spirited defense of the biblical creation narrative .
" In the beginning , God created the heavens and the Earth , " said Huckabee , an ordained Baptist minister .
" A person either believes that God created the process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own . "
Huckabee also said that if Americans " want a president who does n't believe in God , there 's probably plenty of choices .
But if I 'm selected as president of this country , they 'll have one who believes in those words that God did create . "
He went on to quote Martin Luther : " ' Here I stand , I can do no other . '
And I will not take that back . "
Huckabee later added , " If anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate , they are certainly welcome to do it . "
However , when pressed about whether he believed in a literal interpretation of the timeline laid out in Genesis -- that God created the world in six days about 6,000 years ago -- Huckabee said , " I do n't know . "
" Whether God did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time , he did it .
And that 's what 's important . "
Many Christian denominations marry the biblical creation narrative with scientific evidence by accepting evolution as the process God used to create life on Earth .
But many conservative and evangelical Protestants adhere to a literal view of Genesis , rejecting the idea that human life evolved from lower primates over millions of years .
And some in that camp maintain the process did indeed take just six days .
Huckabee 's elucidation of his views during Tuesday 's debate drew a follow - up response from Sen. John McCain of Arizona , who , when the topic came up in the first debate , had said he believed in evolution .
" I admire [ Huckabee 's ] description , because I hold that view , " said McCain , an Episcopalian .
" There 's no doubt in my mind that the hand of God was in what we are today .
And I do believe that we are unique , and [ I ] believe that God loves us . "
Sen .
Sam Brownback of Kansas , who expressed skepticism about evolution during last month 's debate , also elaborated on his views , which he described as being in tune with a philosophy " of faith seeking reason . "
" I believe we are created in the image of God for a particular purpose , and I believe that with all my heart , " said Brownback , a Roman Catholic .
" I am fully convinced there 's a God of the universe that loves us very much and was involved in the process .
How he did it , I do n't know . "
" One of the problems we have with our society today is that we 've put faith and science at odds with each other .
They are n't at odds with each other .
If they are , check your faith , or check your science . "
The third candidate who indicated he did not believe in evolution in last month 's debate , Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado , was not asked to address the question Tuesday .
And Huckabee made it clear that he did not appreciate the question , either , calling it unfair .
" It 's interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president , " Huckabee said .
" I 'm not planning on writing the curriculum for an eighth - grade science book .
I 'm asking for the opportunity to be president of the United States . "
In the experiment guards behaved cruelly towards captives
The debate about ordinary people committing evil deeds rolls on .
But in a personal viewpoint Prof Phil Zimbardo , creator of the Stanford Prison Experiment , says its time to get to grips with why wrongdoing happens .
In 1971 I became superintendent of the Stanford Prison , a mock prison run by psychologists .
I was a young psychology professor at Stanford University , and I wanted to understand what happens when you put good people in a bad place .
To do so , it was necessary to conduct a controlled experiment , so my graduate assistants and I selected college - student volunteers - normal , healthy young men with no history of crime or violence - and randomly assigned them the roles of prisoner or guard .
During the extended experiment , we would observe and record everything that happened .
The inmates would live in their cells and the prison yard 24/7 - the guards would work eight - hour shifts .
Ordinary people can succumb to social pressure to commit acts that would otherwise be unthinkable
Our simulation tried to create a psychology of imprisonment in the minds of all participants , with all - powerful guards dominating powerless prisoners .
To increase the real - life feel , we arranged for actual mass arrests and booking by the Palo Alto police ; visits by a prison chaplain , a public defender , and parents ; even parole board hearings .
Though not part of the plan , there were also prisoner rebellions .
And , notoriously , there was chilling abuse and torture by the guards .
The experiment was supposed to last two weeks , but we had to pull the plug after only six days because nearly half the prisoners had emotional breakdowns in response to the extreme stress and psychological torments invented by their guards - good , young men who'd been overwhelmed by situational forces in the roles they were playing .
' Shocking ' images
Fast - forward to April 2004 .
Horrific images flash across our television screens - nightmarish abuses of Iraqi prisoners by young American soldiers , the male and female military police reservists stationed at Abu Ghraib .
Military commanders condemn the criminal actions of a " few bad apples , " asserting that such abuses are not systemic in our military prisons .
The images were shocking to me , but not unfamiliar .
They were , in fact , strikingly similar to what I had seen at Stanford - prisoners naked , bags over their heads , forced into sexually humiliating poses .
Could the perpetrators of these evils be like the young men in my prison - " good apples " who happened to find themselves in a " bad barrel " ?
Prof Phil Zimbardo has studied the Abu Ghraib episode
Was their behaviour shaped by the same sort of social psychological forces that had operated in the Stanford Prison Experiment ?
My conclusion , after becoming an expert witness for one of the military policemen and reviewing all the evidence of the investigations into these abuses , was that the parallels were palpable .
Indeed , one investigative report highlighted the fact that the " landmark Stanford study " should have been a cautionary tale in preventing the Abu Ghraib abuses .
Historical inquiry and behavioural science have demonstrated the " banality of evil " - the fact that , given certain conditions , ordinary people can succumb to social pressure to commit acts that would otherwise be unthinkable .
To be sure , few of us will ever end up as inmates or guards in military or civilian or mock prisons , but many of us find ourselves in relationships where we dominate other people or are dominated by them .
We spend our lives in institutions of one kind or another , from families , schools , and businesses , to homes for the elderly .
And many times we bow to the will of the group even when it conflicts with our values .
Prejudiced beliefs
In the prisons at Stanford and Abu Ghraib , men and women did terrible things to other people in part because responsibility for their actions was diffused , rather than focused on each of them as individuals ; we find ourselves in a similar situation whenever we witness someone else 's trouble but fail to help because we assume others will .
Likewise , the prisoners at Stanford and Abu Ghraib suffered unnecessarily because the guards regarded them as less than human ; dehumanisation allowed the guards to treat prisoners as lower beings .
The same applies to us when we allow members of a minority group to be derogated as inferior .
Prejudiced beliefs lead to discrimination , and in turn to abuse .
Situational forces affect us when we 're acting in the capacity of a role we 've assumed ; when rules govern our behaviour ; when we 're in uniforms or dressed in ways that conceal our identity ; and of course when we 're in a group whose acceptance seems vital to our self - image .
We want to believe that we are " good , " moral , and self - aware .
We want to believe that we 're different from " bad " or " evil " people .
Thinking so is essential to maintaining a sense of personal dignity and self worth .
But the line between good and evil is permeable , like the cell walls of our body that allow movement of chemicals across their boundaries .
Anything that any human being has ever done - anything imaginable - is potentially doable by any of us in the same situation .
This is not to excuse immoral behaviour ; the point is simply that understanding how someone could have engaged in wrongdoing , rather than dismissing it as a bad deed done by a bad person , allows us to identify corrosive social forces - the very same forces we need to counteract if we want to avoid going down the same wrong path .
Prof Zimbardo is author of the Lucifer Effect - How Good People Turn Evil .
I agree with the professor .
Minorities are often considered different and less deserving .
Once you buy into that , it is easy to dismiss when they are treated poorly .
Throughout history , countries continue to dehumanize the enemy to rally people to accept otherwise unacceptable behavior supposedly needed to defeat the enemy .
Because people want to belong , be loyal or patriotic , they go along with the group for it takes tremendous courage to be the lone person to desent .

The Stanford prison experiment was apparently also the basis for the Big Brother reality TV show - the birth of abuse and Schadenfreude as entertainment in modern society .

An intriguing article .
Of course , we seem to be talking about ' evil ' deeds by everyday people , with no hint of significant chemical or psychological imbalance ?
Is n't one aspect of the crossing of that ' line between good and evil ' that the very same group self - interest and individual need to be accepted by a group , which buttress conformity to ' good ' behaviour , the reasons why ' normal ' people can do such things , in extreme situations .
This is only a minor quibble here , but I agree more with the situationist analysis of this than corrosive social forces being to blame , as such .
Kwesi , London
I do not buy into Prof Zimbardo 's Lucifer Effect theory .
It 's simply an extention of victim culture , i.e .
I 'm not totally responsible for my actions .
When people are brought up with a clear moral compass they instinctivly know right from wrong .
As a member of my hospital 's ethics committee I deal with issues that are often not black and white .
But , I also know where the boundaries are .
No matter what Prof Zimbardo wishes to assert , I know that I would never abuse another human being ( or animal ) no matter how powerful my position over them .
Period .
Dr. David Hill , Jacksonville , Florida
Bravo !
All Professor Zimardo has done is demonstrate that - " The ( human ) heart is deceitful above all things and desparately wicked " - Jeremiah 17 v 9 .
If you do not believe this you will never make any sense of this world .
Whilst others are looking on people will curb their tendancies , but put them behind closed doors and they gravitate towards doing wrong - proved time and again all over the world throughout history .
However , to combat this tendancy means facing up to what is inherent in people and since this is unpalatable the good Professor will probably waste his life looking for non-existent " corrosive social causes " .

I remember reading about the Stanford experiement years - it was absolutely chilling how ordinary , decent young men could become vicious , heartless sadists in a matter of days simply because they were given power over someone else - and I remember looking at picture of Abu Gharib , and thinking of Stanford .
The problem is , most people in their safe comfortable think evil is something that happens to someone else , that given this kind of situation they would behave properly , and cannot understand that people are n't born vicius sadistic brutes , they get made that way .
What 's needed is not blind punishment of what makes people behave this way ( although there should be some punishment ) but study and understanding of them , so we can ensure that other ordinary , everyday people do n't become horrific monsters without them even realising it .

John Snow is asking Congress to approve more borrowing
The government needs Congressional authority to borrow and the total accumulated debt is now close to its limit of $ 8.2 trillion ( £ 4.7 trillion ) .
If the limit is not increased , the government could find it difficult to pay debts or borrow money .
Congress is expected to agree to an extension , averting any debt crisis .
Massive deficits
In a letter to Congress , Mr Snow said he has already taken " prudent and legal actions " to avoid reaching the debt limit .
These include tapping the civil service pension funds and using the $ 15bn in the Exchange Stabilisation Fund , a reserve held for smoothing out volatile movements in the value of the dollar in currency markets .
But the Treasury has warned that such measures will only postpone the credit deadline until mid-March , when an extension will be needed .
This is the fourth time George W Bush 's administration has asked Congress to raise the government debt limit .
His administration has produced a series of massive deficits , brought on by the post dot - com recession , tax cuts , the September 11 attacks and wars and reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The US government has never defaulted on its debts , and to do so would destroy its credit rating and raise the cost of any future borrowing .
Could magnets make the mind grow stronger ?
In mice at least , stimulating the brain with a magnetic coil appears to promote the growth of new neurons in areas associated with learning and memory .
If the effect is confirmed in humans , it might open up new ways of treating age - related memory decline and diseases like Alzheimer’s .
Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) has been used experimentally to treat a range of brain disorders , including depression and schizophrenia , and to rehabilitate people after a stroke .
TMS uses a magnetic coil to induce electric fields in the brain tissue – activating or deactivating groups of …
SAN FRANCISCO , July 31 — The Federal Communications Commission moved cautiously Tuesday toward creating a more open national wireless broadband network , handing a partial victory to Google , which was pushing for more competition in cellphone services .
The agency approved rules for an auction of broadcast spectrum that its chairman , Kevin J. Martin , said would promote new consumer services .
The rules will let customers use any phone and software they want on networks using about one - third of the spectrum to be auctioned .
The F.C.C. did not approve a provision that would have required the winner of the auction to sell access to its network on a wholesale basis to other companies .
Google favored the rule as a way to hasten competition and innovation in the cellphone industry , a market it is considering .
While the language of the ruling has not been made public , it appears that any company that buys the new spectrum will have to leave it open to devices it does not approve or control .
If , for instance , Verizon were to buy spectrum , consumers would have to pay Verizon for access to its network but they could use devices of their own choosing on it .

I hope the big car companies are paying attention .
Using two mopeds , $ 2000 and a little ingenuity , good Samaritan Jory Squibb built a cozy 2 or " 1.5 " passenger car that can get 100 mpg highway and 85 mpg city .
Sure , top speed is only about 50 mph , but that 's plenty fast for cruzin ' the strip for babes ... ecobabes .
The moral of the story comes from Squibb himself :
" Is n't it sad that such a simple vehicle , which could be mass produced for $ 5000 or so , which awaits no fancy fuel cells nor high - tech breakthroughs , is n't available to the public ? "

FINAL ISSUE OF THE REALIST " Opium " by Norman Rockwell .
With goodbyes , predictions and an exclusive final interview of Paul Krassner with himself .
February 2018 UPDATE :
This site completed a raster - scan archive of every issue in 2010 , but we have some recent information that improves the archive .
First , there 's a coffee table book from Fantagraphics called THE REALIST CARTOONS .
Fantagraphics worked with the archive to make a wonderful book compiling the best comics of the full run of The Realist .
It ended up great .
Get a copy here .
Secondly , I 'm delighted to mention the entire archive will soon be available in PDF text - searchable format .
Credit to Jason Witherspoon who transfered each issue to PDF format , greatly increasing the access to information in these issues .
Our THANKS to him .
You 'll see individual issues ( starting with issue one ) rolling out with a PDF option soon .
I 'll have the entire archive recoded to include PDFs within the year .
A NOTE : The Realist Archive began in June 2007 with the goal to put every issue of The Realist online and freely accessible to anyone .
The one large problem was only 1/3 of the run could be found available anywhere ( well available in some places , but at the asking price of a large truck ... Krassner himself did n't have many of the older issues ) .
And an even larger problem being many of the existing issues were ( and are ) crumbling away and required extensive digital restoration ; many issues were destroyed in the act of scanning brittle newsprint itself .
But that was part of the project , and every page of The Realist is now viewable - including even the subscriber - only sheets .

One final item added to archive , entitled " One Year of Editing the Realist " ( November 1959 ) from Lyle Stuart 's THE INDEPENDENT ( click for full scans )
For $ 25 Million , No Way , But for $ 50 Million I ’ll Think About It
At least for me , there are not too many questions that would lead me to respond , “ For $ 25 million , no way , but for $ 50 million I ’ll think about it . ”
Twenty - five million dollars is so much money that it ’s hard to think about what you would do with it .
It sure would be nice to have the first $ 25 million .
I ’m not sure what I would need the second $ 25 million for .
The U.S. Senate is hoping there are some folks in Afghanistan or Pakistan who do n’t see it that way .
Frustrated by the failure of the $ 25 million bounty on Osama Bin Laden to lead to his capture , the Senate voted 97 - 1 to raise the bounty to $ 50 million .
At one level , you have to applaud this move by the government .
To a Pakistani peasant , $ 50 million is an unthinkably large amount of money .
To the U.S. government , which is spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq , $ 50 million is next to nothing .
If one of the major goals of the Iraq war was to get rid of Saddam Hussein , think how much cheaper it would have been to offer a reward of , say , $ 100 billion to anyone who could get him out of office by whatever means they saw fit .
Saddam himself might have graciously accepted the offer and traded the hassles of running a country for a pleasant $ 100 billion pension and a well - appointed French manor .
Indeed , we have blogged before about the virtues of big prizes to encourage people to work on problems , whether it is curing disease or improving Netflix ’s algorithms .
On the other hand , if I ca n’t tell the difference between $ 25 million and $ 50 million , I ca n’t imagine upping the ante will push a wavering Pakistani over the edge of collaborating with the U.S. government .
Much more important , but harder to do , would be to find a way to make it credible that we will actually pay the bounty .
I ’m sure there is plenty of discretion in deciding to whom and how much of that bounty gets paid .
For instance , if I did some statistical analysis that somehow narrowed down his whereabouts to within 1000 yards , and then the Navy SEALS canvassed that area and found him , would I get the money ?
I ’m not so sure they would give it to me .
I ’m sure the Pakistani peasant who has some information on Bin Laden probably shares my doubts .
TWO Blighted Beings , haggard , lachrymose , and detested , met on a blasted heath in the light of a struggling moon .
Master Nicholas , the village barber , however , used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Phoebus , and that if there was any that could compare with him it was Don Galaor , the brother of Amadis of Gaul , because he had a spirit that was equal to every occasion , and was no finikin knight , nor lachrymose like his brother , while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him .
He was by turns devout and obscene , merry and lachrymose .
He grew remarkably drunk , and then he began to recite poetry , his own and Milton 's , his own and Shelley 's , his own and Kit Marlowe's .
I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project , for the next sentence took up another subject : she waxed lachrymose .
The priest comes along dandling his charge as if it were a lachrymose infant he was endeavouring to put into a good humour .
Nioche , at first , for answer , simply looked at him in lachrymose silence .
" God bless you , " the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice .
The best fun was with Madame Joubert : Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing , lachrymose and low - spirited , not worth the trouble of vanquishing , in short ; and Mrs .
Come and be locked up ! "
He slowly recovered an upright position , with the assistance of his hands , backed by the solid resisting power of the bureau ; and lapsed into lachrymose soliloquy .
" Yes , I am Wickens 's boy , " said the witness , partly fierce , partly lachrymose , " and I say I seen him , and if anyone sez I did n't see him , he 's a lie . "

Burg was built as a tower of voices , and folk songs in the minor key were sung until the choir waxed ( as happened at home , upstairs in the Oystercatcher ) lachrymose .
March 17 , 2007  --
Some political odds makers are betting Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will not make it through the week with the same job title .
" The chances of the attorney general surviving this , I think , are slim to none -- and slim just left the building , " said Norman Ornstein , a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute .
Gonzales faces what could be the most challenging week of his career .
On Monday , the Department of Justice is expected to release some 200 pages of potentially damaging e-mails to address accusations he fired eight U.S. attorneys for political reasons on behalf of a White House that felt they were not -- in the words of Gonzales ' former chief of staff , Kyle Sampson -- " loyal Bushies . "
Sampson lost his job earlier this month .
Now it is Gonzales ' own job that 's on the line .
On Thursday , he is scheduled to testify before a skeptical House Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice , as the Senate Judiciary Committee meets to decide whether to subpoena several White House officials involved in the firings , including political advisor Karl Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers .
A Newsweek poll released today found that just one in three Americans believes he should stay on the job .
Most -- 58 percent -- believe the firings were politically motivated .
No one has accused the attorney general of breaking the law , but Democrats , and some Republicans , say he abused his position .
This week , Gonzales took responsibility .
" I acknowledge that mistakes were made here , '' he said .
" I am responsible for what happens at the Department of Justice . "
But he insisted he was out of the loop .
" I am not aware of every bit of information that passes through the halls of the Department of Justice , " he added .
Administration officials say he has no plans to resign , and the president has no plan to fire him .
" I do have confidence in Attorney General Gonzales , " he said earlier this week .
That 's not necessarily a guarantee of job security .
Bush made a similar statement about then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Nov. 1 , telling a group of wire service reporters that Rumsfeld was doing a " fantastic job . "
When asked if he planned to keep Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney on his staff through the end of his term , Bush said , " Yes . "
" Once you get Republican senators calling for your resignation , " Ornstein said , " no matter how strongly the president is behind you , the pressure is building to the point where something has to happen to reduce it , and that means he will go . "
With a couple Republicans -- Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon and Sen. John Sununu of New Hampshire -- already joining Democrats ' calls for the attorney general 's ouster , the pressure for Gonzales to resign is likely to increase .
His fate could rest on whether the White House can keep other Republicans from joining them .
KELO AND CALIFORNIA ….
Last year , in Kelo v. New London , the Supreme Court ruled that local governments had the right to seize land under eminent domain even if they intended to turn the land over to a private firm for development .
At the time , I sort of approved :
The Supreme Court should n’t have invented a new constitutional restriction on eminent domain , but state and local governments should enact laws that limit land grabs designed solely to increase tax revenue .
And if different states want different rules , and want to apply those rules differently in different areas , that ’s fine too .
Well , California has an initiative on the ballot this November that does exactly what I suggested .
But a few days ago Ryan Grim warned that there might be a little more to it :
In Arizona , Montana , Idaho , Washington , and California , libertarians , in concert with the business community , have managed to put initiatives on state ballots that appear to be common sense solutions but are in fact extreme giveaways to the private sector from public coffer .
…. The plan introduces a “ pay or waive ” scheme :
If any government regulation causes a person to lose property or profit ?
even potential , imagined profit ?
the government must either pay that person the value of that which was lost or waive the regulation .
“ Takings ” ( from the constitutional restriction on eminent domain , “ nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation ” ) has been a hot button for years among hardcore libertarians and movement conservatives , who believe that if the government does anything to restrict the use of your land ( and thus lower its value ) , you should receive compensation .
The Supreme Court ruled otherwise long ago when it gave its approval to the newfangled idea of zoning back in the 1920s , and despite a few recent rulings moving slightly in the other direction , cities and states have retained wide authority to enact land use laws .
Most of us think that ’s a good thing .
But sure enough , Ryan is right .
It turns out that in addition to being an anti-Kelo initiative , California ’s Proposition 90 is also an attempt to legislate the long - time libertarian “ takings ” wet dream .
Here ’s what the nonpartisan legislative analyst says :
This measure requires government to pay property owners if it passes certain new laws or rules that result in substantial economic losses to their property .
….
In addition to the examples cited above , the broad language of the measure suggests that its provisions could apply to a variety of future governmental requirements that impose economic losses on property owners .
These laws and rules could include requirements relating , for example , to employment conditions , apartment prices , endangered species , historical preservation , and consumer financial protection .
Nice try , fellas .
A simple anti-Kelo initiative might have had a chance of passing .
But trying to prevent the government from ever enacting legislation that might have an economic effect on property owners ?
Not so much .
I imagine most Californians will elect to stay in the 21st century on this one .

It turns out that weÃ¯ Â ¿ Â ½re all liars when it comes to our sex lives .
In an online survey , psychologists found that many men and women both lied when it came to reporting the number of sexual partners theyÃ ¯Â ¿ Â½ve had .
Women tended to underestimate the number of partners they had , while men tend to overestimate .
When it comes to penises , length matters more to men than to women , according to a new study that reviews more than 60 years of research and debunks numerous sex myths .
About 90 percent of women actually prefer a wide penis to a long one , according to two studies included in the review .
Eighty - five percent of women reported being satisfied with their partner 's penis size , compared to only 55 percent for men .
The review , conducted by Drs. Kevan Wylie and Ian Eardley of the Porterback Clinic and Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield and St. James ’ Hospital in Leeds , United Kingdom , respectively , combines results from more than 50 international research projects into penis size and small penis syndrome ( SPS ) conducted since 1942 .
“ The issue of attractiveness to women is complex , but most data suggest that penile size is much lower down the list of priorities for women than such issues as a man ’s personality and external grooming , ” the researchers write .
[ How Men Lost Their Penis Spines ]
Drawing upon the results of 12 relevant studies , the review , detailed in the British Journal of Urology ( BJU ) International , finds that the average erect penis is about 5.5 to 6.2 inches long and about 4.7 to 5.1 inches in circumference .
Penis myths
The findings also deflate a few other myths about male genitalia .
The notion that penis size varies according to race , for example , is false .
Another oft - repeated myth is that older men tend to have smaller penises , but Wylie and Eardley found no differences when they combined the results of all the studies together .
One surprising finding was that small penis syndrome ( SPS ) , also known as the “ locker room syndrome , ” is much more common in men with normal sized penises than those who have so - called micropensises ( penises with a flaccid length of less than 2.7 inches ) .
An internet survey of more than 52,000 heterosexual men found that 12 percent thought their penises were too small , even though micropenis is estimated to affect only about 0.6 percent of men .
One study suggests SPS often begin at an early age .
Sixty - three percent of men with the disorder said their anxieties started with childhood comparisons , often to an elder sibling or their fathers , while 37 percent blamed erotic images viewed during their teenage years .
Be wary
The review also supports recent studies that find penis - enlarging vacuum devices , penis extenders and traction devices rarely live up to their promises , but can , in some cases , provide a “ psychological uplifting effect . ”
The authors take a wait - and - see approach to penis - enlargment surgery , which can include everything from partially separating ligaments in the penis so it hangs further from the body to injecting fat into the penis to increase its girth .
One of the most extreme procedures involves completely splaying the penis and inserting a piece of cartilage into it before suturing it up again .
“ While information is starting to emerge on the success of some surgical techniques , this is not backed up by data on patients ’ satisfaction with such procedures , ” Wylie said .
The doctors point out some ancient tried and true methods for penis enlargement , but these are n’t any more comfortable .
Indian Sadhus men , for example , use weights to increase their penis length , while the Topamina of Brazil encourage poisonous snakes to bite their penises to get a size boost that lasts six months .
The researchers say their review is intended to “ provide clinicians with an overarching summary of the many research projects that have been carried out into penile size and small penis syndrome ” so that they can better treat the disorder .
When faced with a patient with SDS , “ the initial approach should be a thorough urological , psychosexual , psychological and psychiatric assessment , possibly with more than one clinician involved , ” they write .

Let 's go back to the newspapers of the early 19th century .
They hired the journalists who ran around the city covering news stories .
They employed the editors who directed the journalists and then decided which stories to run and where to run them .
They owned the printing press that printed the papers .
They even owned the distribution system that got the papers delivered to the newstands .
If you look at the newspaper business today , it 's basically the same .
The same is mostly true of television news , at least local television news .
They own the stations , they employ the talking heads who deliver the news and producers who decide what to cover .
Traditional media is about vertical integration , from the creation of the content , to the display of it , to the distribution of it .
There have been some important moves to disaggregate and organize around a horizontal model in recent years .
Cable is a good example of that .
The production of the content is divorced from the distribution of it in the cable model .
CNN produces a 24 hour news channel but Comcast gets it to your home .
The Internet is forcing the entire media business into a disaggregated horizontal model where the creation of the content will happen in one place , the editorial function will happen in another , the production will happen somewhere else , and the distribution will happen in yet another manner .
But these horizontal layers are not going to look like slices of the vertically oriented media company of the past .
You wo n't see a layer of content producer companies selling content to a layer of editorial companies selling content to a layer of distribution companies .
These layers are going to be dominated by lighweight web services ( think google or craigslist ) that will empower the users themselves to do this work .
People talk about user generated content as if there is another kind .
There is n't .
I love the story about the animated video created for Firefox Flix that prompted the people at Firefox to say " that was done by a professional " .
Maybe so , but he is still a user and a fan , and as professional as it seems , it is user generated content .
Same is true with Om Malik .
Is he a traditional journalist or a blogger ?
Does it matter ?
Editors are quickly being replaced by services like Digg or the new Netscape where people decide what goes up on the front page and what does not .
And we are in the top half of the first inning when it comes to a people powered editorial function .
This is where I see a lot of action happening in the coming years .
And distribution ?
Well for one , its all going via IP ; wire line , powerline , coax , wifi , wimax , 3g , and who knows what other forms of IP .
But people powered distribution is the big story here too .
Whether its emailing links , embedding videos onto social network pages and blogs , or superdistribution of music and video where everyone participates in the value chain , we are seeing the end users participate actively in the distribution of media .
So when I get a business plan that suggests that all of this can be packaged into a single company , a new media company for the digital age , I cringe .
Media will not be delivered from creation to consumption by a single entity in the digital age .
Anyone who tries will fail .
I am sure of it .
UPDATE : In my haste to finish this and get to a dinner with friends , I left out the whole monetization layer .
That wo n't be any different .
Ad networks like Adsense , FM Publishing , TACODA , and FeedBurner are already showing how that 's going to play out .
But maybe that 's a post for tomorrow .
When I was kid , I loved to ask my minister questions about things that , to my young mind , made no sense when I read them in the Bible or more likely heard them in Sunday school .
His answers were always rather bland and not a little aloof since , after all , he was the pastor and I was just a kid .
I remember asking about how humans and dinosaurs could coexist .
After all , they had to be a part of the creation story , even though not mentioned specifically .
Or why would dinosaurs be taken on the ark , only to go extinct such a short time after ?
And how do you cage a T - Rex or fit a Brontosaurus on such a boat , much less a pair of all sorts ?
I got a lot of looks but very few answers .
As the years went by , I concluded that none of it was either possible or even addressed in the Bible .
I realized humans and dinosaurs had nothing in common ( unless you live in the SE USA ) and the pastor was either ignorant , deliberately deceptive or hung up somewhere in between himself , not knowing what to say to a kid .
I honestly think I would have appreciated knowing what I suspect he knew , that being the story of Noah was fiction and I did n't have to worry about dinosaurs or polar bears for tha matter on the ark .
It never happened .
I remember asking why the Bible , a book which had to know better since it was written by God himself , said Joshua raised his hands and the " sun stopped for the space of about a day , " when clearly it would be the earth that stopped rotating ?
I asked him how oceans would not slop out of their basins in such a scenario and drown the whole world ?
I asked him if humans would not be cast into space by such a sudden stop of the entire planet ?
I even asked if this really happened , why did no one else on the whole planet notice it , or write about it ?
I got that dumb look again .
I asked what about all those in history and even now who have never heard of Jesus .
He said they all are saved in their ignorance , though another minister I asked said they all go to hell of some sort .
So depending on who you ask , the ignorant either get an automatic free pass for their trouble or go to hell , having no awareness of what they did to deserve that !
Hmmmm .
Something ai n't right here !
I did respond by asking him why then we should send missionaries and put the ignorant at risk , when if we just leave them alone , they can make it in their ignorance of never having heard the only name under heaven by which a man can be saved .
I got the look again .
I went to a Christian college to study these things .
Boy if you think I had questions as a kid !
" Why did God not like Cain 's vegetable sacrifice but loved Abel 's cooked meat ? "
Answer ... Vegetarians are weak Christians .
" Who was Cain afraid would kill him when God put him out of the Garden for killing Abel ?
There were mom , dad , bro and himself on the whole planet at the time . "
Answer ... He must have known his sisters were going to have kids with dad , no not that .
He was speculating .
Cain was n't thinking very clearly that day .
" Why would God stop the whole earth for a day so Israelites could finish a genocide against the enemy ? "
I mean , I can see stopping it so there is more time to hug , or feed the hungry , or plant the crops , but more time to kill ?
Dumb story .
Answer ... God hates sin and had to kill the bastards , he just needed more time than he planned on . "
" How come the horses in the Exodus die twice in the Ten Plagues and still survive for Pharoah to mount a final attack against the Israelites , and then die again . "
Answer ... Where do you get this stuff ?
" Why , no matter what , is it always the human 's fault and God never gets any blame for not making good on his promises ? "
Answer ... It 's a mystery .
Have faith .
God 's ways are not your ways .
" Why does the Apostle Paul , who writes most of the New Testament , NEVER quote Jesus , tell a story of his life or death , discuss a miracle or teaching ? "
Answer ... Where do you get this stuff ?
" Why does neither Mark nor John know anything about Jesus birth , while Matthew and Luke do but tell contradictory stories ? "
Answer ... Because the Gospels are like four people who see a car wreck ...
" Why does Paul only say Jesus was born of a woman like everyone else ? "
Answer ... Paul was concerned about the risen Jesus , not the earthly one .
He was too busy to check up on the details .
" Did Paul ever spend five minutes with the real human Jesus ? "
Answer .. well no , but Paul 's Jesus is the risen Jesus , it does n't matter .
" Is n't it strange the man who writes most of the New Testament and tells us all how to live , think and believe about Jesus , never met him , while the Twelve who did , vanish into thin air and write nothing / " Answer ... You ain't from around these parts are you boy .
" How come Jesus never wrote anything himself while alive , but then writes perfect Greek after he is dead in the form of the Book of Revelation ? "
Answer .... He finished his PHD in Heaven .
" If Herod killed all the little children under two to get at Jesus , who escaped , can we not say the little children had to die for Jesus before he died for them ? "
Answer ... No we can 't , sheesh .
" How come Herod could n't follow the Star of Bethlehem himself to find Jesus , but sent others to report back when they found him ? "
Answer ... He was busy .
" How could Mary leave town after being warned of Herod 's intentions and never tell the women in the town , their kids were about to be butchered ? "
Answer ... she was under oath not to tell the Angel story .
" Do you think Mary thought , ' I know something you do n't know , ' as she left town ? "
Answer ... you 're sick .
" How could Jesus family flee to Egypt sometime during the first two years in one story but go home to Narareth quietly after 40 days in the other ? "
Answer ... It 's a miracle .
" How come in Mark 3 Mary and his brothers came to get Jesus and take him home because they thought he was " mad " which I assume means insane .
Did Mary forget who he was and how he got here ? "
Answer ... shut up .
" How come Matthew uses the Old Testament to weave a story of Jesus , where every quote he uses has absolutely nothing to do with the point he is making about Jesus birth ? "
Answer ... While we might flunk you for such methods , we give Matthew an A , because , well , he 's Matthew .
Bible guys get to do and say things you 're not allowed to .
" If Jesus was asked ' who sinned , this man or his parents that he was born blind ? ' , would that not imply the man had sinned before his birth , perhaps in a previous life , if his blindness at birth was some kind of punishment ?
I mean , the blindness was from birth , so the sin had to be before that . "
Answer ... Ummm.. , no .
Whatever the answer , it 's definately not that one .
" So is it just me , or are these good questions to ask about the text and theology of the Bible ? "
Answer ... It 's just you .
While we might be marginally informed ourselves , we are very piously convicted of our answers .
The wisdom of man , and this would be you in this case , is foolishness with God .
You 're fired and have a nice day .
And so it goes .
If you want to make a pastor , elder or deacon turn white with fear or red with anger , just ask a Bible question based on the actual text or what today we would simple know as common sense .
Depending on his denomination , education , candor and personal spiritual confidence , he will react accordingly .
Most pastors I know are sincere , but ill informed or duplistic and well informed , not willing to risk all for what they clearly also see is a problem with the " inerrant " text of the Bible .
Kinda sad actually , but when it comes to matters of the spirit , it is important to keep asking those questions about a book that proports to have the key to everything and the only right way for a human to think .
It 's important to ask questions of all such books and ideas .
Let 's face it , take away the zealots and fundamentalists from Judaism , Islam and Christianity , and the planet might actually find some peace .
Killing the messenger for bringing the message some do n't want to hear , is however , still the preferred way to handle such things all too often .

Net and its framework from the help included with same .
Obtaining DotLisp
DotLisp is now open source , released under the BSD license , and hosted as a project on SourceForge .
Philosophy
The idea behind DotLisp was to build a Lisp for .
Net that yielded to the CLR those things provided by the CLR that languages normally have to provide themselves : a type system , a memory management system , a library , while at the same time retaining the essence of Lisp as a language .
Table of Contents

A DotLisp program is a sequence of expressions .
An expression is a literal , or the parenthesized list indicating the application of a primitive or other expression to zero or more arguments .
The first argument of a parenthesized expression is evaluated like any other before being ' applied ' to the arguments .
Many things can be applied to arguments in DotLisp including functions , members ( both functions and properties ) , types ( as constructors ) and anything else ( as an index to an object with a default indexer ) .
DotLisp is case sensitive .
; denotes a to - end - of - line comment
true , false
Booleans ( System. Boolean )
nil
()
Nil ( equivalent to .
Net null reference , and the empty list ) , matches any type
1 , 2 , -3
Integers ( System. Int32 )
1.2 , 3.e10
Floating point ( System . Double )
" a string "
Strings ( System . String ) .
Strings can span multiple lines , whitespace is preserved .
There is no character literal yet , suggestions ?
Characters
' fred
Symbols ( DotLisp .
Symbol )
'* varname
Dynamic vars must have prefix *
:a-keyword - symbol
Keywords symbols are prefixed with : and evaluate to themselves
' ( a b c )
Lists ( DotLisp .
Cons )
[ 1 2 3 ] ; Int32 [ ]
[ 'a 'b 12 ] ; Object [ ]
Arrays ( if homogeneous args , will be array of common type , else Object [ ] )
note : arrays are not true literals , merely shorthand for ( vector ... )
Int32 .
Hashtable .
Types ( the framework name followed by a dot ) .
Funcallable , act as constructors :
( Hashtable .
1000 ) ; yields a new Hashtable with initial capacity of 1000
. foo ; instance member - can be field , property or function
( set ( . foo x ) 5 ) or ( . foo x 5 ) ; == > x.foo = 5 in C #
Console : WriteLine ; static member - type : member - field , property or function
( Console : WriteLine " Hello World " ) ; invocation
Instance members ( the member name preceded by a dot ) .
Funcallable .
Fields , properties and instance member function are all generalized to be functions on the target object .
If the member function takes arguments , they follow the target object :
(.foo x 1 2 3 )
There is some syntactic sugar for instance member access - x.foo is transformed ( at read time ) to ( . foo x ) in all cases except when in first position of form , where it is translated to . foo x ( no parens ) .
This lets you do all of the expected things with no more parens than C# ( just in different places ) :
( prn x.y ) ;=> ( prn ( .y x ) ) - access a member , no parens required
x.foo ;= > ( . foo x ) - no arg function call - no parens !
( x.foo 1 2 3 ) ;= > ( . foo x 1 2 3 ) - function call with args
In addition , explicit qualification of members is supported when needed using . type : member -
(. IEnumerable : GetEnumerator obj )
This is occasionally required when a type provides only an explicit implementation of an inherited interface function .
_ ;underscore

Reflection .
Missing .
Value
$ , $ $ , $ $ $
The last , next - to - last , and next - next - to - last values evaluated

( DotLisp .
Interpreter )
( eql ? x y )
Function : Equality - returns true if x and y are the same object , or are .
Net value types and x.Equals(y ) , else false
( eqv? x y )
Function : Equivalence - returns x.Equals(y )
( if testexpr thenexpr [ elseexpr ] )
Primitive : if testexpr is true , yields thenexpr and does not evaluate elseexpr , else returns elseepxr .
If elseexpr is omitted it defaults to nil .
Note : DotLisp has a generalized notion of truth where nil and false are conditional false and everything else is conditional true .
( when testexpr thenexpr )
Macro : same as ( if textexpr thenexpr )
( not x )
Function : returns false if x is conditional true , else true
( when - not testexpr thenexpr )
Macro : same as ( when ( not textexpr ) thenexpr )
( cond testexpr1 thenexpr1
...
testexprN thenexprN
[ :else elseexpr ] )
Macro : evaluates the testexprs in order and returns the corresponding thenexpr as soon as one is conditional true .
If no testexpr is true and else clause is present , returns elseexpr , otherwise returns nil .
Note : fewer parens than Common Lisp because thenexprs are not in implicit progns ( blocks ) .
( case testexpr
( key a1 ... keyaN ) thenexpra
...
( key n1 ... keynN ) thenexprN
[ :else elseexpr ] )
Macro : compares the testexpr to unevaluated keys with eql ?
and returns the corresponding thenexpr as soon as one is eql ?.
If no key is eql ?
and else clause is present , returns elseexpr , otherwise returns nil .
Note : fewer parens than Common Lisp because thenexprs are not in implicit progns ( blocks )
( and arg1 ... argN )
Macro : evaluates args in order , returning nil as soon as one is conditional false , else returns argN .
( or arg1 ... argN )
Primitive : evaluates args in order , returning first that is conditional true , else returns nil .
( nand x y )
( xor x y )
Macros that do what you expect
( nil ? x )
Function : returns true if x is nil , else false
( to - bool x )
Function : converts DotLisp conditional truth values to Boolean true or false , i.e. to - bool nil or false -> false , to - bool anything else -> true
( missing ? x )
Function : return true is x is System .
Reflection .
Missing .
Value ( _ )
( quote x )
'x
Primitive : returns x un-evaluated
( type - of x )
Function : returns corresponding
Type object
( is? x atype )
Function : returns true if x is instance of atype
( def x expr )
Macro : creates a top - level variable bound to x with initial value of expr
( block exprs )
Primitive : evaluates exprs in order and returns the value of the last
( fn ( [ params ] ) exprs )
Macro : creates an anonymous function object that when invoked , evaluates the exprs in an implicit block with the params bound to the actual arguments
Params can contain optional parameters ( &opt ) , keyword parameters ( &key ) and rest parameters ( &rest ) .
Pretty much like Common Lisp lambda except no supplied - p- parameters .
&opt and &key params without defaults get assigned System .
Reflection .
Missing .
Value ( _ , testable with missing ? ) .
&opt and &key parameters with defaults will get the defaults when no args is supplied , as well as when _ ( Missing . Value ) is supplied :
>( def ( foo &opt ( x true ) ) x ) >( foo ) true >( foo _ ) true >( foo false ) false >( def ( bar &opt x ) ( foo x ) ) >( bar ) true > ( bar false ) false
( def ( f [ params ] ) exprs )
Macro : creates a top - level variable f bound to a function .
Same as
( def f ( fn ( params ) exprs ) )
( let ( var1 initexpr1 ... varN initexprN )
exprs )
Macro : evaluates exprs in an implicit block , with each var i bound to the corresponding initexpr i , returning the value of the last .
Same as
( ( fn ( vars ) exprs ) initexprs )
Note fewer parens than Common Lisp since no single vars default bound to nil
( lets ( var1 initexpr1 ... varN initexprN )
exprs )
Macro : Let sequential - Like let , but vars are updated sequentially
( letfn ( ( f1 [ params ] ) body 1 ... ( fN [ params ] ) bodyN )
exprs )
Macro : Let function(s ) - Like let , but with each f i bound to a fn with body i .
Body definitions can be recursive , referring to themselves or each other :
( letfn ( ( foo x )
( when (> x 0 ) ( prn x ) ( bar (- x 1 ) ) )
( bar x )
( foo x ) )
( foo 2 ) )
( dynamic - let ( * var1 initexpr1 ... * varN initexprN )
exprs )
Macro : Dynamic - let , like let but for dynamic variables , original values are restored after exprs block completes
( eval astring )
Function : reads the string and evaluates it
( apply f arg1 ... seq )
Function :
The last arg must support get -enum .
Applies f to arg1 through argN - 1 followed by the set yielded by enumerating seq .
( load afilename )
Function : loads the file and evaluates the expressions contained therein as if entered at top - level .
( load - assembly name )
Function : loads the specified assembly and makes names and types accessible to the program .
( load - assembly - from filename )
Function : loads the specified assembly file and makes names and types accessible to the program .
( set place1 val1 ... placeN valN )
Macro : sets each place to its corresponding val in sequence , returning valN
( parallel - set place1 val1 ... placeN valN )
Macro : sets each place to its corresponding val in parallel , returning valN
( shift - set place 1 ... placeN )
Macro : each place takes on the value of the subsequent place , and placeN keeps its value
( rotate - set place 1 ... placeN )
Macro : each place takes on the value of the subsequent place , and placeN gets the value of place1
( def - setter placefn setfn )
Macro : associates setfn as the setter of placefn , such that calls of the form
( set ( placefn args ) val ) are transformed into ( setfn args val )
Allowing you to say ( set ( first x ) val ) instead of ( set - first x val )
( cons x y )
Function : creates a new Cons object with a first of x and a rest of y .
Note : Cons objects in DotLisp are not arbitrary pairs , i.e. the rest must be another Cons object or nil .
Therefore all lists are ' proper ' .
Conses implement IEnumerable .
cons ? , atom ? , list ? , first , rest , second , third , fourth , nth , len
Functions : all take a list and do what you would expect .
( set - first lst val )
( set - rest lst cons - or - nil )
( nth - rest lst n )
( reverse lst )
Functions :
Do what you would expect
( reverse ! lst )
Function : destructively reverses lst , minimizing consing
( append list1 list2 )
Function : returns a new list of the items in list1 followed by the items in list2 .
May share structure with list2
( concat ! list1 list2 )
Function : destructively concatenates list1 and list2 , minimizing consing
( last lst &opt ( n 1 ) )
Function : returns tail containing last n elements of lst
( butlast lst &opt ( n 1 ) )
Function : returns list containing all but last n elements
( mapcat ! f &rest lists )
Function : Similar to CL mapcan
( member obj lst &key ( test eql ? ) )
( member - if pred lst )
Functions : Return tail beginning with found element or nil if not found
( push ! val cons-place )
Macro : sets cons-place to ( cons val cons-place )
( pop ! cons-place )
( next ! cons-place )
Macros : set cons-place to ( rest cons-place )
( vector arg1 ... argN )
[ ar g1 ... argN ]
Function : makes a one - dimensional array with args as initial elements .
If all args are of same type , than array is of that type , otherwise an array of Object .
( vector - of type arg1 ... argN )
Function : makes a one - dimensional array of type
Note these are just sugar , you can do these same things and more through the Array type .
( n anarray )
Returns the nth element in the array .
( n array val )
Sets the nth element of the array to val and returns val
Note the above 2 array operations are just instances of the general indexing capability .
Any non-function , non - type , non-member in the first position in an expression will be ' applied ' to the first argument if it supports a default indexer , and if a second argument is supplied it will be treated as a set operation .
So :
( 1 " fred " ) -> r
( " fred " ahashtable " ethel " ) ; set fred key to ethel value
( " fred " ahashtable ) -> " ethel " ; access it
+ , - , * , / , min , max
Functions : multi-argument arithmetic .
+= , -= , *= , /= , ++ , --
(+= x n ) -> ( set x ( add x n ) )
Macros : calc and set , ++ and -- add / subtract 1

( bit - not x )
Generic function : bitwise not .
Methods defined for integer types and enums .
even ? , odd ? , zero ? , positive ? , negative ?
Functions : test what they imply
( while test exprs )
Primitive :
While test is true , evaluates exprs , returns nil
( until test exprs )
Macro :
While test is non-true , evaluates exprs , returns nil
( for inits test update &rest body )
Macro : roughly , ( lets inits ( while test ( block body update ) ) ) , returns nil
( dolist var lst &rest body )
Macro : evaluates body with var bound to successive elements of lst
( dotails var lst &rest body )
Macro : evaluates body with var bound to successive tails of lst
( for - each var seq &rest body )
Macro : seq must support get -enum .
Evaluates body with var bound to successive elements of seq
DotLisp supports a generalized notion of sequence and several functions that take and yield sequences .
A sequence is any object for whom the get - enum generic function is defined .
( get - enum x )
Generic function : Returns an IEnumerator over x .
Methods are predefined for IEnumerator and IEnumerable , so all of the sequence functions work with .
Net collections .
( make - enum inits get &rest move )
Macro : creates a lazy IEnumerator object based upon supplied code .
inits are bound as by lets , get is evaluated to define IEnumerator .
Current ( ) , and the expressions of move are in an implicit block , the last of which must yield a boolean which will be the return value of IEnumerator .
MoveNext ()
For example , range is defined as follows :
( def ( range start end &opt ( step 1 ) ) ( make - enum ( x start curr start ) curr ( set curr x ) ( += x step ) ( < curr end ) ) )
filter , map , concat and others are defined using make - enum .
N.B. no Reset ( ) support or off - the - ends protection .
( map -> list &rest seqs )
Like CL mapcar except args can be sequences and not just lists .
Differs from most of the following sequence functions in returning a list rather than another ( lazy ) sequence .
( map1 f seq )
Function : yields a lazy sequence that is the result of calling f for each element in seq .
( map f &rest seqs )
Function : f must be a function that takes as many args as there are seqs .
Yields a lazy sequence that is the result of calling f with the first element from each seq , then the second etc .
Stops when the end of the shortest seq is reached .
( filter pred seq )
Function : returns a lazy sequence that containing those values in seq for which pred returns true
( find val seq &key ( test eqv ? ) )
Function : returns a lazy sequence of those items in seq for which ( test item val ) returns true .
( concat &rest seqs )
Function : returns a lazy sequence which is a concatenation of the items in seqs .
( reduce f seq &key init )
Function :
If seq is empty , returns init if supplied , else the result of calling f with no args .
For some non-empty seq comprised of a b c , if init is supplied the result is equivalent to :
(f ( f ( f init a ) b ) c )
if init is missing , result is equivalent to :
(f ( f a b ) c )
( any pred &rest seqs )
Function : pred must take as many args as there are seqs .
Calls pred with the first element from each seq , then the second etc and returns the first true value returned , else stops when the end of the shortest seq is reached and returns false .
( every pred &rest seqs )
Function : pred must take as many args as there are seqs .
Calls pred with the first element from each seq , then the second etc and returns the first false value returned , else stops when the end of the shortest seq is reached and returns the last value returned by pred .
( into coll seq )
Generic function : Dumps seq into the collection coll by means equivalent to append ( i.e. the collection will contain the seq in order if the collection has a notion of order ) .
Methods are predefined for IList , Cons and nil , the last of which will cons up a new list :
( into nil [ 1 2 3 ] ) -> ( 1 2 3 )
The general idiom being the use of sequence functions to dump into your choice of existing or new collection :
( into ( ArrayList . ) ( map . ToString [ 1 2 3 ] ) ) ; puts " 1 " , " 2 " , " 3 " into new ArrayList
Note that you can map any funcallable thing , including member functions , properties , types ( constructors ) and indexes .
backquote ( ` ) , unquote ( ~ ) and unquote - splicing ( ~@ ) operators are all supported .
Note : use of tilde rather than comma for unquote because comma will be needed for multi-dimensional array type names ( which are not yet implemented )
( def - macro ( m [ params - pattern ] ) exprs )
Macro : Defines a macro named m.
Destructuring is supported for the params pattern as long as it does not contain &key or % opt args , i.e. params patterns can contain nested list structure including &rest params , or &key and &opt params , but not both .
( macroexpand - 1 pattern )
Function : returns the result of expansion on the pattern
( gensym )
Function : generates a new , unique symbol
DotLisp supports generic functions of arbitrary arglists that dispatch on the type or value of the first arg , and generic binary operators of exactly 2 args that dispatch on both argument types ( but not on values ) .
( def - method ( gfname ( p1 dispatch - type - or - value ) &rest params ) &rest body )
Macro : defines a new method for the generic function gfname that will be operable for calls where the first argument is of the ( best - matching ) type dispatch - type - or - value if it is a Type , or its value otherwise .
&opt , &key and &rest params are supported in the argument list .
No effort is made to ensure that different methods for the same generic function have conforming signatures .
Within the body , the function ( call - base - method ) is available ( for type - dispatching methods only ) , and when called with no args will invoke the method that would match the base class / interface of p1 .
If there are methods defined on more than one base , the one chosen is undefined .
( def - binop ( gbname ( p1 dispatch1 ) ( p2 dispatch2 ) ) &rest body )
Macro : defines a new method for the generic binop gbname .
Generic binops match only on types , not values .
Binops do a best - match on p1 followed by a best match on p2 .
( str x )
Generic Function : returns a str representation of x for printing .
Methods are defined for Object ( using . ToString ) , nil , true , false , String , ICollection , Cons etc .
No effort is made for round - tripping values via print and read .
( pr &rest xs )
Function : for each x in xs , prints each ( str x ) to * pr - writer using .
Write , with the separator * pr-sep
( prn &rest xs )
Function : same as ( pr xs ) followed by a newline
( prs &rest xs )
Function : for each x in xs , prints each x to * pr - writer using .
Write , with the separator * pr-sep
( prns &rest xs )
Function : same as ( prs xs ) followed by a newline
( def - record type &rest fields )
Macro : type can be a single symbol or ( NewType BaseType . ) , where BaseType is also a record type .
Note that the new type symbol is not followed by the dot ( . ) because the type dpes not yet exist .
After calling defrecord you can refer to NewType. with the dot like any other type .
If no base is supplied , the base is DotLisp .
Record .
Fields can be single symbols or parenthesized symbol / default - value pairs as per &keys args .
The type is created along with code to support make - record ( which must be used rather than the typical constructor call in order to create an initialized record object ) .
( make - record type &rest args )
Function : creates an instance of the type , which must have been dreated with def- record , and a set of key / value pairs corresponding to some or all of the members of type or its bases class ( es ) .
Any members for which no values are supplied will be initialized to their defaults ( if supplied to def- record ) or else _ (. Missing .
Value ) .
> ( def- record NewRec ( x 1 ) ( y 2 ) z )
NewRec .
> ( def rec ( make - record NewRec. :x 5 ) )
{ NewRec . { " x " 5} { " y " 2} { " z " _}}
Fields of records can be accessed using the member syntax :
> (.x rec ) ; access x member , rec.x ok too
5
> (.x rec 10 ) ; set x member
> rec
{ NewRec. { " x " 10} { " y " 2} { " z " _}}
In addition , record types are expando - i.e. new members can be introduced via set :
> ( set rec.w 10 ) ; set non-existent w member , ok
> rec
{ NewRec. { " x " 10} { " y " 2} { " z " _} { " w " 10}}
However it is an error to access a non-existent member that has not been set :
>rec.b
! Exception : Record does not contain member : b
Derived records add fields to their base :
> ( def - record ( DerivedRec NewRec. ) ( ethel " fred " ) ( ricky " lucy " ) )
DerivedRec .
> ( make - record DerivedRec . )
{ DerivedRec . { " x " 1} { " y " 2} { " z " _} { " ethel " " fred "} { " ricky " " lucy " }}
However only fields declared in the class can be initialized in make - record .
Base class members will get their defaults ( i.e. z below can not be initialized via make - record DerivedRec . ) :
> ( make - record DerivedRec. :z 9 :ethel " merman " )
{ DerivedRec . { " x " 1} { " y " 2} { " z " _} { " ethel " " merman "} { " ricky " " lucy " }}
To allow base members to be initialized or define new defaults , they can be redeclared in the derived record :
> ( def - record ( DerivedRec NewRec. ) ( ethel " fred " ) ( ricky " lucy " ) ( z 9 ) ) ; redeclare z
DerivedRec .
> ( make - record DerivedRec . )
{ DerivedRec . { " x " 1} { " y " 2} { " z " 9} { " ethel " " fred "} { " ricky " " lucy " }}
> ( make - record DerivedRec. :z 11 :ethel " merman " )
{ DerivedRec . { " x " 1} { " y " 2} { " z " 11} { " ethel " " merman "} { " ricky " " lucy " }}
Record types can be redefined without restarting .
To .
Net , the " members " do not exist as fields or properties , rather , the type has a default String indexer through which the member values can be obtained .
( try body &key catch finally ( catch - name 'ex ) )
Macro :
Will execute body in a try block .
If an exception is thrown and catch is provided , will execute catch expression with the catch - name symbol bound to the thrown exception .
In all cases , will execute the finally expression if provided .
( with - dispose inits &rest body )
Macro : will initialize inits via lets , then evaluate body in a try block whose finally clause will call IDisposable : Dispose on any non-null vars from inits .
( throw ex )
Function : throws the Exception ex
( error msg )
Function : throws an Exception with the message text msg
( trace &rest fnames )
Macro : will write to System .
Diagnostic .
Trace whenever functions in fnames are called
( untrace &rest fnames )
Macro : cancels tracing for funcs in fnames .
If fnames is nil , cancels all traces
DotLisp supports dynamic creation of delegates bound to closures .
( make - delegate DelegateType. ( &rest delegate - args ) &rest body )
Macro : makes an instance of DelegateType bound to the closure body .
The number of args and return type ( if any ) must match the delegate :
>( set e ( make - delegate EventHandler . ( sender e )
( prn ( list sender e ) ) ) )
System .
EventHandler
>( e. Invoke " x " EventArgs : Empty )
( " x " System .
EventArgs )
DotLisp is now packaged as a DLL assembly .
Inside the assembly the Interpreter class is public .
Creating an instance of this class gives you a fully independent interpreter , with the following interface :
Interpreter ( )
Constructor .
Builds an interpreter instance with built-ins and primitives loaded into its environment .
Boolean Eof( Object o)
Returns true if o is the end - of - file object , else false .
Use this to test the value returned by Read ( ) .
Object Eval( Object expr )
Evaluate expr , where expr is an expression returned from Read ( ) .
For now , consider the type and structure of expr to be opaque , i.e. do n't hand something to Eval ( ) that you did n't get from Read ( ) .
void Intern ( String name , Object val )
Set the global value of the symbol named name to be val .
Use this to expose your application - level objects to DotLisp code .
void InternType( Type t)
Expose the type t to DotLisp code so it can be referenced via type literals ( i.e. with Typename . )
void InternTypesFrom( Assembly a )
Interns all the types from a .
Object Load( TextReader t)
Read and Eval the code from t. Return value TBD .
Object LoadFile ( String filepath )
Loads the code from filepath .
Return value TBD .
Object Read( TextReader t)
Reads the next expression from t. Returns the expression , suitable for evaluation by Eval ( ) , or an object for which Eof ( ) will return true , indicating end - of - file was reached .
String Str( Object o)
Returns the String representation of o that would be returned by the generic function str in the DotLisp environment .
void Trace ( DotLisp .Symbol sym )
Turn on tracing of calls to sym .
void UnTrace ( DotLisp .Symbol sym )
Turn off tracing of calls to sym .
void UnTraceAll ( )
Turn off tracing of all symbols
ICollection TraceList{get;}
The set of all symbols currently being traced .
Given this interface , a basic REPL loop looks like this :
DotLisp .
Interpreter interpreter = new DotLisp .
Interpreter ( ) ;
for ( ; ;) { try{ Console . Write ( " > " ) ; Object r = interpreter .
Read( Console .
In ) ; if ( interpreter .
Eof (r ) ) return ; Object x = interpreter .
Eval(r ) ; Console.WriteLine( interpreter . Str(x ) ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { Console.
WriteLine ( " !
Exception : " + e.GetBaseException ( ) .
Message ) ; } }
DotLisp exposes the delegate type Function and the interface IFunction to allow functions written in other languages can be incorporated into DotLisp .
Any instance of Function or instance of a class implementing IFunction with be funcallable .
Just implement in the language of your choice and then Intern them with the name you desire .
The signatures are :
public delegate Object Function ( params Object [ ] args ) ;
public interface IFunction { Object Invoke( params Object [ ] args ) ; }
In addition , closures written in DotLisp implement IFunction and can be invoked via that interface .
A service has launched in the UK which allows you to track any mobile phone around the globe and follow its movements from your own computer .
The Guardian ran a feature on it yesterday called ' How I stalked my girlfriend ' .
It painted a scary picture .
The service is run by World - Tracker , a company based on the Isle of Man .
When a mobile number is entered onto the World - Tracker website , a text message is sent to that phone , to ask if the person carrying the phone wishes to be tracked .
If consent is given by reply , World - Tracker will show the location of the mobile phone on a map or as a map reading , using a Google Maps - based interface .
The accuracy is between 50 and 500 metres .
When the phone moves , the movement can be monitored online whenever the phone is turned on .
The system can be accessed through either a PC or mobile phone with internet access .
It works with mobiles on the Vodafone , O2 , T - Mobile and Orange networks .
World - Tracker is targeting parents who want to keep an eye on their children ’s movements ; businesses wanting to track their workers ; lone workers , who feel more secure if someone else knows where they are ; and anyone else who has ever lost a mobile phone – giving reassurance that their phone can be located more easily .
But in yesterday 's Guardian , freelance writer Dr Ben Goldacre revealed a sinister side to the service .
( He did n't name the site in his article ; but Dr Goldacre had discussed it previously in a Radio 4 interview in which World - Tracker was also involved ) .
He signed up – for £ 5 plus VAT – and he provided his girlfriend 's phone number .
He lives with her and said he needed her phone for just five minutes to initiate the tracking .
According to his article , the first message read : " Ben Goldacre has requested to add you to their Buddy List !
To accept , simply reply to this message with ' LOCATE ' "
He replied from her phone as instructed and another text arrived : " WARNING : [ this service ] allows other people to know where you are .
For your own safety make sure that you know who is locating you . "
He deleted these messages and tracking began .
Dr Goldacre has said that he had his girlfriend 's consent for his experiment , conducted in the interests of journalism ; but his article portrays a system open to abuse – and according to World - Tracker , Dr Goldacre omitted some vital details about its service .
OUT - LAW spoke to World - Tracker today .
It described a quite different service .
A spokesman – who did not wish to be named – said the company follows an industry Code of Practice for the use of location data .
He pointed out that a breach of the Ofcom - endorsed Code would result in the mobile networks withdrawing their services from World - Tracker .
An important step required by the Code was not mentioned in the Guardian article : it demands that periodic text messages are sent to the phone .
According to World - Tracker 's spokesman , the company complies with this requirement in the Code .
The Code of Practice states
" Subsequent to activation , the [ location service provider ] must send periodic SMS alerts to all locatees to remind them that their mobile phone can be located by other parties .
These alerts should be sent at random intervals , not in a set pattern .
The suggested text and minimum standard frequency for sending the alerts is set out in Annex D . "
In fact , Annex D is marked confidential : it is only made known to location service providers like World - Tracker , perhaps to minimise the risk of message interception .
Fiona Caskey , an Associate with Pinsent Masons , the law firm behind OUT - LAW .
COM , regularly advises companies on data protection issues , including surveillance of employees .
She said that if the company is following the code , it is probably doing all that is necessary to comply with the country 's privacy laws .
But unscrupulous boyfriends are taking a risk if they seek to exploit the service .
" If Ben had n't obtained his girlfriend 's consent , he'd be breaking the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , better known as RIPA , " said Caskey .
It is an offence under RIPA to intercept and delete someone else 's text message , she explained .
" Such behaviour runs a risk of up to two years ' imprisonment and a fine . "
Perhaps surprisingly , the boyfriend is unlikely to breach the Data Protection Act by his acts .
" He could argue that he was doing this for ' domestic purposes ' – and he's off the hook , " said Caskey .
Ben Goldacre replies ...
* Update ,
03/02/2006 18:15 : Dr Goldacre contacted OUT - LAW with the following comments : " You quote an accusation by World Tracker that I 'omitted some vital details about its service ' .
You go on to say that ' An important step required by the Code was not mentioned in the Guardian article : it demands that periodic text messages are sent to the phone . ' "
Dr Goldacre says he told a World - Tracker representative on last Friday 's Radio 4 interview that he had tracked phones through World - Tracker 's service for several days , and then deleted them from the World Tracker website – " and they have never received these follow - up warning messages .
It is as simple as that .
The Radio 4 reporter 's phone that we also tracked specifically never received any follow up text messages . "
When confronted for a response on this matter , Dr Goldacre says the World - Tracker representative replied that he would " look at our system " and " make sure that a text goes out in a sooner period . "
Dr Goldacre continues : " I explained my concern that once somebody was deleted off the system they would never get a follow - up text , and never know that they were being tracked , and he agreed : ' As things stand at the moment no , but this is something that we should seriously look at . ' "
He concludes : " The security provisions that World Tracker currently have in place present no barrier whatsoever to somebody tracking a phone undetected , exactly as I described in my piece , and there was no wilful omission of information from my article . "
OUT - LAW did not listen to the Radio 4 interview and we did not speak with Dr Goldacre before reporting the comments made by World - Tracker .
We apologise for any offence caused to Dr Goldacre as a result of these omissions .
We have notified World - Tracker that this story has been amended and suggested that they communicate directly on this matter .

MELBOURNE ( Reuters ) -
An Australian hotel catering for homosexuals has won the right to ban heterosexuals from its bars so as to provide a safe and comfortable venue for gay men .
In what is believed to be a first for Australia , the Victorian state civil and administrative tribunal ruled last week that the Peel Hotel in the southern city of Melbourne could exclude patrons based on their sexuality .
Australia ’s equal opportunity laws prevent people being discriminated against based on race , religion or sexuality .
But Peel Hotel owner Tom McFeely said the ruling was necessary to provide gay men with a non-threatening atmosphere to freely express their sexuality .
“ If I can limit the number of heterosexuals entering the Peel , then that helps me keep the safe balance , ” Peel told Australian radio on Monday .
McFeely said that , while the hotel welcomed everyone , its gay clientele had expressed discomfort over the number of heterosexuals and lesbians coming to the venue in the past year .
He said there were more than 2,000 venues in Melbourne that catered to heterosexuals , but his hotel was the only one marketing itself predominantly to gay men .
Victoria ’s state human rights commission backed the ruling , saying it was in line with equal opportunity guidelines defending the rights of groups subject to discrimination .
Commission chief Helen Szoke said the hotel ’s gay clientele had experienced harassment and violence .
“ ( They ) also have felt as though they ’ve been like a zoo exhibit with big groups of women on hens ’ parties coming to the club , ” Szoke told reporters .
McFeely told the radio that the hotel had received homophobic telephone calls since news of the ruling was made public .
Valerie Wilson , the former intelligence operative at the heart of an investigation that reached into the White House , sued the Central Intelligence Agency in federal court in New York yesterday over its refusal to allow her to publish a memoir that would discuss how long she had worked for the agency .
Although that information is set out in an unclassified letter to Ms. Wilson that has been published in the Congressional Record , the C.I.A. contends that her dates of service remain classified and may not be mentioned in “ Fair Game , ” the memoir Ms. Wilson hopes to publish in October .
C.I.A. employees sign agreements requiring them to submit manuscripts to the agency for permission before they are published , and Ms. Wilson ’s suit said she spent 10 months working with agency officials on the book to avoid disclosing national security information .
But the agency ’s refusal to allow her to include material already in the public domain , the suit said , violates her right to free speech .
“ The C.I.A. ’s effort to classify public domain information is an unreasonable attempt at prior restraint of publication and a violation of our First Amendment rights , ” said Adam Rothberg , a spokesman for Simon & Schuster , which plans to publish the book and is also a plaintiff in the suit .
Well , you know , screw you , I 'm not anti-gay .
We 're against gay marriage .
I do n't want gays to be discriminated against .
I mean , I think we have , in addition to blacks , I do n't know why all gays are n't Republicans .
I think we have the pro-gay position , which is anti-crime and for tax cuts .
Gays make a lot of money , and they 're victims of crime .
I mean , the way -- no , they are .
They should be with us .
According to " research " conducted by Salary.com ( just in time for Mothers ' Day ! ) , mothers ' work , if compensated , would bring in $ 138,095 a year .
The typical mother puts in a 92 - hour work week , the company concluded , and works at least 10 jobs .
In order of hours spent on them per week , these are : housekeeper , day - care center teacher , cook , computer operator , laundry machine operator , janitor , facilities manager , van driver , chief executive officer and psychologist .
By figuring out the median salaries for each position , and calculating the average number of hours worked at each , the firm came up with $ 138,095 ....
1 ) First off , we all have to conduct Normal Life Activities .
2 ) If you do parts of each of ten jobs , you do n't get paid proportional parts of the salary of each of the ten jobs .
3 ) Let 's talk about the CEO thing .
CEOs create wealth for shareholders .
4 ) Middle managers ( and psychologists ) are generally salaried .
5 ) Since we 've done " CEO , " let 's talk about " psychologist . "
6 ) Jobs are worth however much other people will actually pay you for them .
7 ) People who prioritize making money make more money .
8 ) Corollary to the above :
If you accept a " job " working for your husband
9 ) Let 's keep going with that .
It 's unclear what meaning it could have to say that the wife of a man who makes , say , $ 60,000 a year is really doing a $ 138,095 job
10 ) Basic economics : jobs become worth less when more people are qualified to do them .
Feminist Wrap - Up A :
Feminist Wrap - Up B :
Feminist Wrap - Up C :
( If this story sounds familiar , it 's because Salary.com releases a new figure each year , which is a great way of keeping their name in the news ) .
Before I get started on this , can we all agree that there 's something not - right about this ?
That this $ 138,095 figure is bound to provide some satisfaction to underappreciated mothers , but ... this all sounds a little wonky , right ?
I think it would be reasonable to hypothesize that mothers who take a salary survey on Salary.com on this topic may not be entirely representative of mothers as a whole .
They are likely the overachievers .
Perhaps some have applied their education and ambition to child - rearing in a way that adds to their workloads ; at very least , they are mothers with internet access and have enough familiarity with paid workplace activities to be familiar with Salary.com .
But even disregarding that possible skew , let 's continue .
Mmn-hmmn .
Ten points : Those of us who do not have children still must wash our dishes and bandage our own cuts and scrapes .
The respective hourly wages of dishwashers and nurses are wholly irrelevant .
We are all uncompensated for the business of keeping life going .
Shift managers at Starbucks perform part of the jobs of CEOs in that they manage people .
Great , you 're still a shift manager !
If you 're not qualified to do the ( of a CEO or a full - time " computer operator , " for instance ) , then it 's very unlikely that your salary will go up for being able to do part of the job .
A worker at Barnes & Noble operates computers , but is not doing the whole job of being a " computer operator " ; he or she does not receive a proportionally - higher salary during the time that he or she operates computers .
They manage companies that have thousands or millions of employees , and head organizations with multiple levels of management .
Even if you have ten kids and part of your job is to delegate to or co-manage with a spouse and possibly the hired help , your job is still more like that of a middle manager -- you know , like someone onwho has twelve people 's activities to orchestrate .
A middle manager might make $ 50,000 a year , as opposed to the millions made by a CEO .
Why do CEOs make that much money ?
Because they work harder ?
Of course not .
It 's because shareholders are banking that attracting the best CEO talent will increase their own investment in the stock .
This -- in any other than the most shady metaphorical sense -- is wholly irrelevant to parenting .
( In fact , if millions of people were buying stock in your kids and you were then obligated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to act entirely in the interest of increasing the value of your stockholders ' shares , you 'd be a pretty shitty parent ) .
So again : middle manager .
So you can't take the amount of the salary , divide it by 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year , figure out an hourly wage , and then multiply it .
The salary figure is fixed ; it does not change based on hours worked .
If you have a salaried job and you are asked to work too many hours , you can try to be more efficient , you can ask a superior for some kind of adjustment or assistance -- or you can quit .
Notice how irrelevant this seems to the profession of mothering ?
( It 's hard to leave for a better offer ) .
This is wonky math .
JUST BECAUSE YOU PERFORM DUTIES " LIKE " A PSYCHOLOGIST DOES NOT MAKE YOU A PSYCHOLOGIST .
A million dudes who call themselves " amateur gynecologists " do n't deserve $ 100 K + a year for that , either .
Psychologists , I 'm sure , are pleased that apparently their medical degrees and licenses are irrelevant .
I 've sometimes offered advice to a friend in need , but I do n't charge , and if I did , my counsel would be worth less than that of someone who , you know , passed the MCAT .
Obviously .
This is the first thing that probably made the Salary .
comreport seem a little wonky at first .
( Notably , the whole point of rest of Salary.com is not to advocate for what people " should " be paid for their jobs , but rather to aggregate data about what theypaid ) .
If the job of mothering is " worth " $ 138,095 a year , how comeever pays anyone that amount for it ?
( If such a position were to be offered , it would probably only be available to exceptionally beautiful young women -- the Melania Knauss - Trumps of the world -- which would make it a different kind of job and skew our results .
But even then , a mail - order bride is cheaper and does not demand an annual salary .
( See how this monetization business is getting a little insulting ?
Never fear , Feminist Wrap - Ups follow ! )
Shocker !
If the average salary for a receptionist is $ 40,000 a year , but you make $ 22,000 a year because you are a receptionist at an environmental nonprofit that you believe to be saving the world , then you 're probably not shocked that you make less than the Salary.com average .
You knew that when you signed up .
If making money were your top priority , you'd be a receptionist at Bear Sterns , or , better yet , not a receptionist .
If you choose a path that does not provide a traditional wage , or you follow -- through intention or simply going along with things -- one of the less lucrative paths available , it does n't mean anything to say you " deserve " some other salary .-- who very likely makes less than $ 138,095 a year himself -- of course you are not surprised that you make less than $ 138,095 . , even if no one on earth will pay her that to do it .
Hmmn .
Well , say we 're talking about even a very appreciative husband here ( the one who makes $ 60,000 ) .
Obviously , he can't pay her more than he even makes -- just as a " CEO " can't expect to be paid more money than a company has access to .
I can't go work as " CEO " for a company with less than $ 1 M in revenue and expect to be paid more than $ 1 M a year , even though that 's small potatoes for CEOs -- unless , of course , I can raise the small company 's revenues by many millions of dollars per year , such that it becomes possible and worthwhile to compensate me in proportion to my having increased the value of the firm .
How does that apply to mothering ?
It does n't .
Because having children is not a profit - making enterprise .
To ask for CEO - type compensation for it would be to ask to be paid based on how much money you can make off the children .
( And if you are one of the few Dina Lohans who makes money off the children , you 're already getting your $ 138,095 .
Is that the model we 're aiming towards ?
I think not ) .
Take " being a patent attorney " versus " delivering Chinese food in New York , on a bicycle .
"
The second is hard , unpleasant , and extremely dangerous , and , as I understand it , often pays less than minimum wage .
This is because a great many people can do it , including illegal immigrants who speak near - zero English .
How many people are qualified to be patent attorneys ?
In America , under 100,000 .
How many people are qualified to be mothers ?
Over a hundred million .
( You might argue that not all of them are good at it , which is certainly true , but only the very worst are ever removed from their positions by Social Services , so I think it 's fair to count all of the mothers allowed to remain in their jobs ) .
When more people are able to perform a certain job , the wages for that job are driven lower .
Everyone who 's every studied the Industrial Revolution , Taylorism , the AFL , or the Progressive Era should be familiar with this concept .
Okay , that was the ten points .
Now , please keep in mind , I 'm a feminist .
So where do we go from here ?
Maybe instead of painting mothers as oppressed women forced into roles in which they are embarrassingly being exploited by their overlords ( who pay themof their earned wages ! ) , we should think of them as women who 've chosen to do things they think are more important than making money .
Perhaps women are adults who have the ability to make their own choices in a capitalist society .
Maybe putting out feel - good reports right before Mothers '
Day telling mothers that they 're performing a $ 138,095 a year job -- when they know that no one will pay them that much money to do the job ( and , like most Americans of both genders , no one will pay them that much to dojob ) -- is just a little patronizing .
Women are supposed to lap up blatant lying because we enjoy flattery oh - so - much ?
Condescending in the extreme .
No one is performing this sort of calculus for , say , male activists who do n't get paid for their labor .
What if a male global - warming activist works 92 hours a week , performing parts of the jobs of CEO , marketing director , van driver , computer operator , etc . ?
Does anyone feel the need to calculate some kind of pseudo - salary expressing the total dollar value of his unpaid , but very important , work ?
Seems kind of meaningless .
I think we assume that the unpaid male global warming activist does n't need emotional shoring - up , or pretty lies .
A double - standard here is patronizing and anti-feminist .

People mock me for referring to my athletic footwear as “ sneakers . ”
Apparently that is an old fashioned term .
I am told the correct term is “ tennis shoes ” even if the athletic shoes in question are not designed for use on a tennis court .
This seems wrong .
If my athletic shoes allow me to “ sneak ” someplace without making noise , and are unsuitable for playing tennis , I say they should be called sneakers .
I was reminded of this the other day at the movies .
The theater asks customers to silence their “ cell phones . ”
This already seems old fashioned to me .
I only own one phone .
It ’s in my left front pocket all the time .
It ’s my home phone , my work phone , and my cell phone .
All of those terms will be old fashioned in your lifetime .
Your kids will simply have a “ phone . ”
Do you remember when computers were “ multimedia ” ?
That word went away as soon as every computer could handle sound and video .
The descriptor “ high definition ” will evaporate in about ten years too .
And you wo n’t have to talk about “ downloading ” music because that ’ll be the only way to get it .
Recently a friend joked about going to the library to help with his son ’s school project .

WASHINGTON , May 20 — Senator Arlen Specter , the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee , said today that Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales might resign before the Senate registers a vote of no confidence in him .
Senate Democrats have said they would bring a no-confidence resolution to the floor as soon as this week because of continuing questions about Mr. Gonzales ’s role in the dismissals of eight federal prosecutors last year and strong doubts about his leadership of the Justice Department .
On “ Face the Nation ” on CBS , Mr. Specter noted that no-confidence votes in the Senate were rare , adding , “ I have a sense that before the vote is taken , that Attorney General Gonzales may step down . ”
In the American system , no -confidence votes are symbolic .
In 1886 , the Senate adopted such a resolution against President Grover Cleveland ’s attorney general , A.H. Garland , because he had refused to provide documents explaining the ouster of a federal prosecutor .

Whatever tops your list , you may be surprised to know that all of these health problems are linked to the beverages you drink — or do n’t drink .
Last year , with the support of the Unilever Health Institute in the Netherlands ( Unilever owns Lipton Tea ) , a panel of experts on nutrition and health published a “ Beverage Guidance System ” in hopes of getting people to stop drinking their calories when those calories contribute little or nothing to their health and may actually detract from it .
The panel , led by Barry M. Popkin , a nutrition professor at the University of North Carolina , was distressed by the burgeoning waistlines of Americans and the contribution that popular beverages make to weight problems .
But the experts also reviewed 146 published reports to find the best evidence for the effects of various beverages on nearly all of the above health problems .
I looked into a few others , and what follows is a summary of what we all found .
At the head of the list of preferred drinks is — you guessed it — water .
No calories , no hazards , only benefits .
But the panel expressed concern about bottled water fortified with nutrients , saying that consumers may think they do n’t need to eat certain nutritious foods , which contain substances like fiber and phytochemicals lacking in these waters .
( You can just imagine what the panel would have to say about vitamin - fortified sodas , which Coca - Cola and Pepsi plan to introduce in the coming months . )
Steven Gilliard Jr. , a political journalist who found his calling as a combative and influential blogger on the left , died on Saturday in Manhattan .
He was 42 .
He died after having been hospitalized at Lenox Hill Hospital since February because of heart and kidney failure , said his cousin Francine Smith , a spokeswoman for the family .
From his perch at The News Blog , whose advertisements and donations paid for his modest living expenses , Mr. Gilliard offered his powerful readership a blunt and passionate take on the events of the day .
He was one of fewer than a dozen liberal political bloggers to make a living from his blog , said Markos Moulitsas Zúniga , the founder of the Daily Kos Web site , to which Mr. Gilliard had been an early contributor .
Mr. Gilliard was born in Harlem and attended Hunter College Elementary School and Hunter College High School before graduating with a degree in journalism from New York University .
Cilj vzpostavitve semantičnega spleta ( torej različice 3.0 ) je vzpostavitev okolja , v katerem bodo informacije strojem ne samo dostopne ampak tudi ‘ razumljive ’ .
Izziv , o katerem bo tekla beseda , pa je , kako narediti informacije ljudem ne samo razumljive , ampak tudi dostopne na bolj intuitiven ( domač ) način .
Bolj preprosto povedano , kako spremeniti zastarel način upravljanja z datotekami tako , da bo čim bolj podoben upravljanju s spomini .
Raziskovalci ob takšnih izzivih črpajo neizmerno inspiracijo iz poskusa poustvarjanja človekovih možganov .
Kaj se torej dogaja s spomini – zaključenimi celotami informacij , ki jih shranjujemo v glavi – od trenutka , ko nastanejo , do trenutka , ko jih potrebujemo ?
Nad njimi izvajamo naslednje funkcije :
umeščanje
( poleg shranjevanja sta ključnega pomena opis oz .
klasifikacija in povezovanje z drugimi zapisi ) ;
( poleg sta ključnega pomena oz .
klasifikacija in z drugimi zapisi ) ; priklic
( v priklicu se skrivata dve komponenti , iskanje in izpis ) ;
( v priklicu se skrivata dve komponenti , in ) ; spreminjanje
( poleg novih informacij , ki vplivajo na spreminjanje zapisov in povezav med njimi , je ključen dejavnik , ki spreminja spomine , čas ) .
Enake funkcije kot jih izvajamo nad spomini v glavi , izvajamo v računalnikih nad datotekami .
Datoteke v tem primeru predstavljajo elektronski zapis zaključene celote informacij in jih omenjam zgolj zaradi lažjega razumevanja problema .
Nikakor pa ne želim namigovati , da je sistem datotek / map kot ga poznamo danes edini pravilen ali celo najboljši način urejanja informacij .
Umeščanje
Pri današnjem konceptu upravljanja z datotekami v procesu umeščanja izvedemo dve operaciji : datoteko poimenujemo in shranimo v mapo .
S spomini ne naredimo niti prve , niti druge operacije .
Spomin zapišemo v skupno ‘ mapo ’ in ga takoj povežemo z ostalimi zapisi .
Če bi se torej želeli približati temu sistemu , bi morali datoteko , ko jo shranimo , razčetveriti ( angl. quarter ) .
Mape in druge datoteke bi morale prežati na nove datoteke in se z njimi – če bi algoritem ocenil , da je smiselno – povezati .
Ponudba za Microsoft bi se tako lahko v hipu znašla v mapah : ponudbe , microsoft , wordovi dokumenti , tomasz , danes … in bi bila povezana z drugimi sorodnimi datotekami .
Poleg tega , da moramo ( ?!) datoteko poimenovati in jo shraniti v točno določeno mapo , obstaja v obtoječem sistemu še nekaj nenavadnih omejitev : datoteka ne more biti brez imena ali imeti več imen , ne more biti hkrati v dveh mapah ali v nobeni , isto ime kot druga pa ima lahko le , če nista v isti mapi .
Tudi s klasificiranjem datotek imamo težave , saj to ponavadi storimo le s pripenjanjem pripone .
Tako definiramo le , s katerim programom smo jo ustvarili in kateri program jo bo znal odpreti .
No , v resnici naš stroj datoteko avtomatsko opiše še z datumom , avtorjem in nekaj sistemskimi atributi , ki uporabniku koristijo bore malo ali pa le občasno ( velikost datoteke na primer samo , ko praznimo diskovje ) .
Zagotovo pa preveč energije vlagamo v iskanje novega unikatnega imena za datoteko .
Ali kot pravi Gelerntner : “ If you have three pet dogs , give them names .
If you have 10.000 head of cattle , do n’t bother . ”
Bolje bi se bilo posvetiti klasificiranju oz .
označevanju ( angl. tagging ) datotek .
Saj si tudi informacije v spomin prikličemo po vsebini , ne pa po imenu .
Kako koncept označevanja datotek izgleda v praksi , lahko preizkusite z Google Docs .
Ko začnete pisati , vam dokumenta ni treba poimenovati , ampak ga v enem trenutku preprosto samo shranite .
Seveda , da ga boste lahko kasneje – ko se bo nabralo sto in več dokumentov – našli , vam bosta pomagala Googleov iskalnik in oznake ( angl. tag ) .
Dokument “ označite ” tako , da zanj preprosto vnesete poljubno število ključnih besed , ki jih ločite z vejico .
Google tako ponovno orje ledino in uporabnika vzpodbuja k označevanju dokumentov in ne k iskanju imena .
[ Pripis dodan 13.10.2006 in črtan 3.7.2007 , ko je Google spremenil način upravljanja z datotekami ]
Priklic
Kot že rečeno , je priklic sestavljen iz iskanja in prikaza rezultatov .
Na nivoju iskanja gre za izpis najbolj relevantnih enot informacij glede na podane parametre ( glej PageRank na Wikipedii , kako Google prihaja do relevantnih rezultatov ) .
O tem obstaja precej pametnih besedil , zato ne bi rad zašel preveč v detajle .
Ključen problem , ki ga še ni uspelo v celoti rešiti , izhaja iz dejstva , da je mogoče relevantnost ugotavljati tako iz vsebine kot iz tega , kdo je avtor informacije .
O boleznih srca se bo verjetno veliko bolj relevantno opredeljeval kardiolog kot ekonomist .
PageRank sicer upošteva ‘ moč ’ reference , ki kaže na stran , a še vedno gre tu le( ? ) za oceno , ki jo daje stroj .
Sicer je mogoče kompetentnost avtorja ugotavljati iz same vsebine , a se tudi tu pojavijo težave .
Mimogrede , nezmožnost ugotavljanja kakovosti vira je ena od najbolj resnih hib Wikipedie , saj moje mnenje o erupcijah vulkanov šteje enako kot mnenje priznanega geologa .
Pri izpisih se težave pojavljajo predvsem takrat , ko želimo rezultate različnega tipa izpisati na različne načine .
Gre za to , da lahko rezultate na poizvedbo ‘ Fidel ’ ( res je , Castro je prvi rezultat tega iskanja po moji glavi ) izpišem kot podobo ( slika bradatega moža v SMB obleki ) ali kot podatek v nekem besedilu ( naslov članka , ki sem ga prebral pred kratkim v reviji The Economist ) .
V iskalnikih ta problem rešujejo z zavihki : podatke tipa slika iščem na enem , video posnetke na drugem , novice na tretjem , lokacijo na zemljevidu pod četrtim zavihkom in tako naprej .
Kako torej te podatke prikazovati ne glede na tip , pa kljub temu na urejen način ?

Se nadaljuje … o spreminjanju , toku spominov in iskanju pravih rešitev .

Wanneer u frames voor uw ramen kiest , maakt u zich in eerste instantie mogelijk zorgen over de stijlen van ramen die u voor uw huis wilt .
Dit is zeker een essentieel aspect van het selectieproces .
U moet echter ook frames voor uw ramen kiezen .
Enkele van de meest gebruikte framematerialen zijn PVC , aluminium en hout .
Blijf lezen voor meer informatie over de juiste keuze bij het overwegen van raaminstallatie in Ottawa .
De professionals van Canadian Comfort Windows & Doors kunnen u helpen de beste ramen voor uw huis te vinden .
Als je vragen hebt over stijlen of materialen , aarzel dan niet om ons team te raadplegen .
Houd rekening met de volgende punten bij het winkelen voor raamkozijnen :
Hout : houten kozijnen bieden een esthetische aantrekkingskracht .
Als u de voorkeur geeft aan een natuurlijke uitstraling voor uw huis , passen houten kozijnen misschien bij uw voorkeur .
Hout kan ook vrij gemakkelijk worden geverfd , waardoor het een veelzijdige keuze is .
In tegenstelling tot metalen kozijnen , zullen houten kozijnen niet roesten .
Als hout echter niet wordt behandeld , kan het gaan rotten of kromtrekken .
Hout kan ook gevoelig zijn voor termieten en andere insecten .
Houten kozijnen kunnen duurder zijn dan aluminium of PVC kozijnen .
Dit geldt vooral voor kwaliteitshout dat niet wordt geleverd met vervormingen of knopen .
Aluminium :
Aluminium raamkozijnen kunnen slagvast worden gemaakt .
Dit kan handig zijn op plaatsen met harde wind en krachtige stormen .
Ze kunnen verschillende architectonische stijlen aanvullen .
Aluminium frames zijn over het algemeen vrij duurzaam en kunnen een kosteneffectieve optie zijn .
Ze zijn lichtgewicht en verkrijgbaar in verschillende maten .
Een van de grootste nadelen van het gebruik van aluminium kozijnen is dat ze niet zo energiezuinig zijn als hout en PVC .
Ze bieden ook niet het isolatieniveau dat houten frames bieden .
PVC :
PVC is een andere populaire keuze voor raamkozijnen .
Net als aluminium is PVC slagvast en weerbestendig .
PVC raamkozijnen hoeven niet te worden geverfd als houten kozijnen .
PVC is een recyclebaar materiaal , evenals hout en aluminium .
PVC - frames vereisen heel weinig onderhoud , zodat ze huiseigenaren tijd en geld kunnen besparen .
PVC vervormt niet of verandert op een andere manier van vorm , dus het zal waarschijnlijk niet zo vaak hoeven te worden vervangen als houten frames .
Het belangrijkste nadeel van PVC is dat het , tenzij u een product van hoge kwaliteit gebruikt , mogelijk niet de esthetische aantrekkingskracht van hout of metaal biedt .
Een ander nadeel is dat PVC van slechte kwaliteit bros kan zijn en ook kan verkleuren .

Nowadays , Centralia is an abandoned and ghostly place .
The fire still burns beneath the town and there is enough coal to feed the fire for up to 250 years .
The ruins of Centralia no longer exists on some maps .
Most of the buildings have been razed , and at casual glance the area now appears to be a meadow with several paved streets through it .
According to
Additional smoke and steam can be seen coming from an abandoned portion of Pennsylvania Route 61 , which was closed in the 1990s after several large cracks appeared on the road , the area just behind the hilltop cemetery , and various other cracks in the ground scattered about the area .
As Alan Bellows explains in his
In 1962 , a little fire in Centralia ( Pennsylvania ) migrated into an exposed vein of anthracite coal under the town .
The flames on the surface were successfully extinguished , but the coal continued to burn underground for many years , so that in 1984 the fire was completely out of control and the city had to be evacuated .

Yesterday , I was working on a Haskell program that read in megabytes of data , parsed it , and wrote a subset of the data back to standard output .
At first it was pretty fast : 7 seconds for everything .
But then I made the mistake of parsing some floating point numbers , and printing them back out .
My performance died : 120 seconds .
You can see similar problems at the Great Language Shootout .
Haskell runs at 1/2th the speed of C for many benchmarks , then suddently drops to 1/20th for others .
Here 's what 's going on , and how to fix it .
( Many thanks to Don Stewart and the other folks on #haskell for helping me figure this out ! )
Profiling in Haskell
GHC , the Glasgow Haskell Compiler , has a really nice profiler .
To use it , ask the compiler to turn on profiling :
$ ghc - prof - auto - all - O -- make ParseData.hs
Then , run your program with some extra flags , and look at the output :
$ ./ParseData +RTS -p -RTS < data.csv > / dev/null $ less ParseData.prof
You may also need to assign some " cost centers , " which give you fine - grained profiling inside larger functions .
See the manual for details .
The Culprits : String , read and show
As it turns out , my program suffered from the typical problems :
Haskell 's standard String type is painfully slow .
Code which touches it is doomed to run at 1/20th the speed of C .
To fix this problem , use ByteString for high - performance work , which should get you back up near 1/2th the speed of C. read and show are not your friends .
Either replace them with ByteString functions like readInt , or write your own versions by hand .
Don Stewart has provided some nice examples that call out to C .
Obviously , the standard library needs to get better in these areas .
And it would n't hurt to apply these tips to the Haskell code in the Great Language Shootout , either .
But my program now runs in 14 seconds , and 65 % of that time is in the one remaining call to show .
So it looks like Haskell is OK for high - performance text - munging after all !
( Update : The latest Haskell performance notes can be found on the Haskell wiki . )

Developing economies are at major risk from climate change
Wide - ranging US amendments to a draft communique prepared ahead of June 's G8 in Germany summit cite a " fundamental opposition " to the proposals .
Germany wants all G8 members to agree timetables and targets for major cuts .
Greenpeace , who leaked the document , said it showed UK PM Tony Blair failed to persuade the US to alter its stance .
In the document , US officials make major changes to the communique .
In comments printed in red ink , the US negotiators express disappointment that earlier concerns have not been taken on board .
We have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position
US comments on leaked communique
" The US still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " a red - inked note reads .
" The treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses ' multiple red lines ' in terms of what we simply cannot agree to , " it continues .
" We have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position . "
However , in Washington , senior US lawmakers have written to President Bush expressing their dismay at the administration 's position , the AFP news agency reports .
US 'isolated '
Correspondents say the document hints at a looming struggle over the issue of climate change at the G8 summit , to be held on 6 - 8 June in Heiligendamm , Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to use Germany 's presidency of the G8 to secure a major climate change deal , including :
Agreement to slow the rise in average temperatures this century to 2C
A cut in global emissions by 50 % below 1990 levels by 2050
A rise in energy efficiency in power and transport by 20 % by 2020 .
Greenpeace Director John Sauven described the US position as " criminal " .
" The US administration is clearly ignoring the global scientific consensus as well the groundswell of concern about climate change in the United States , " he said .
Mrs Merkel should make it clear the US was isolated on the issue among G8 members , he added .
Speaking on 24 May , British Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested the US could be on the verge of altering its climate policy .
The US has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol , which sets out targets for lowering emissions until 2012 .
" I can't think that there 's going to be many people running for presidential office next time round in the US who are n't going to have climate change in their programme , " said Mr Blair .
" I think it is possible that we will see action - and at least the beginnings of that action at the G8 - I hope so .
That 's what I 'm arguing for . "
Recently I was on a panel about language " usage and abusage . "
The idea was for me and three other language specialists to answer the audience 's questions about why there is such an epidemic of " sloppy grammar " afoot in America .
" Why are people using interface as a verb ? " " What 's with nucular ' " ?
For a linguist , panels like this are fun , but it 's rather like having gone back to the 18th - century to interface , if I may , with an audience unaware of Darwinian basics and , when presented with them , smugly skeptical .
The reality that animals and plants have changed eternally has gained a pride of place in enlightened conversation , such that creationism is on the defensive .
On the other hand , the general public has yet to join the 21st or even 20th century when it comes to language .
The educated person is taught that a language is something enshrined in its " right " form in dictionaries and Strunk & White , such that any departures from this book and guide are " mistakes . "
In fact , it is every bit as inherent and inevitable for languages to change as it is for animals and plants to .
What we are taught to recognize as " mistakes " are simply tomorrow 's version of the language .
Valentine 's
Day provides an object lesson , in that humble yet marvelous word  love .
A simple , proper word , some might believe .
But , in fact , like all words , it has a chaotic mess of a history .
It is one of several offshoots of a little piece of lexical kudzu that some bands of land - hungry Neolithic farmers infected in Europe .
We only know so much about them .
Apparently they were eager to make the world safe for horses , wheels , and patrilineal inheritance , and they emerged either on the steppes of southern Russia or in what is now Turkey .
But the language they brought with them when they spread westward into Europe is the seed for most of today 's European languages .
In that language there was a word , leubh , that meant " to care " or " to approve of . "
In each region of Europe these people 's language spread throughout , leubh settled in with them and morphed into different shapes and meanings , rather like Web log became blog .
By two millennia ago , this was happening to leubh in the language that was soon to become " Englisc . "
The word love was one outcome  one may well have love for something that one cares for or approves of .
Love was as a noun , but quickly started being used as a verb as well .
That is , when you say , " I love you " to someone , you are using a word that began as a noun just as fax , interface , and green - light did .
Yet we would have little interest in an early Englisc - speaking shepherd scolding us for using love as a verb .
And love was only part of the story anyway .
Meanwhile leubh also morphed into what we know as leave  not as in departing , but as in the archaic expression " I give you leave to , " or in other words , it meant " approval . "
This leave is more alive to us as it was bound into the word belief  belief means approval .
Like other nouns , belief was turned into the verb believe .
Plus , notice the jump from leubh to leave : people started " mispronouncing " leubh just as you - know - who pronounces nuclear as nucular .
But the planet keeps spinning and we have no sense that the " proper " pronunciation of belief is " beleubh . "
It was the same with the transformation of leubh into love .
Every time we say love or belief , we are , technically , mispronouncing leubh !
Then there are even more distorted morphings of leubh hiding in our language .
In the language of those Wanderlusty Roman charioteers there was a prefix s- that you could tack on to a verb to strengthen its meaning .
So , s- leubmeant to love actively , to love " hard " as black Americans used to phrase it .
For reasons I wo n't burden you with , s - leubh actually became s-neubh .
In Italy , sneubh , or " loving hard , " came to mean " to marry . "
But the s dropped off after a while , and the result was that in Latin , the word for " marry , " sneubh , became the root nub - .
As far as English goes that would be neither here nor there except that there was a time when English took on quite a bunch of Latin words , which included ones with the nub - root , like connubial and nuptial .
It is interesting that we think of connubial and nuptial , the spawn of people dropping an s and turning an l into an n , as formal , whereas Eliza Doolittle dropping her h's in " Pygmalion " is seen as evidence of a lack of refinement .
One could note that the word love is the descendant of an ancient word that contained within it desire , approval , belief , and permission .
That 's sweet , but a tad antimacassar .
The word love that we will hear in such proliferation today is one dollop of restless horsemen's heedless splattering , unconcerned with its multifarious fates , of leubh all over Europe .
US handling of Iraqi detainees has been controversial from the start
Lt Col William
Steele is accused of giving detainees free use of a mobile phone at Camp Cropper and fraternising with the daughter of a detainee .
It is the latest of several scandals involving US jails in Iraq , the worst being the 2003 Abu Ghraib abuse case .
Col Steele is also accused of improper behaviour with his Iraqi interpreter and holding unauthorised information .
There are four overall charges against Col Steele and nine specific alleged offences .
He was arrested last month and is being detained in Kuwait , a US military spokeswoman said .
CHARGES AGAINST COL STEELE
Providing unmonitored mobile phone to detainees Mishandling classified information Fraternising with detainee 's daughter Inappropriate relationship with interpreter and providing her special privileges Failing to obey a lawful order Possessing pornographic videos Failing obligations as approving authority for expenditure
The alleged offences took place between October 2005 and February 2007 , a US statement said .
Col Steele was arrested in March .
" His current status is that he is in confinement and waiting for his Article 32 hearing , " the spokeswoman said .
The hearing would be conducted by a panel of military officers who are to decide whether the suspect should face charges .
Criticism
Camp Cropper , in the west of the Iraqi capital close to Baghdad International Airport , is believed to hold about 3,300 Iraqi prisoners .
It is the second largest US military jail in Iraq , the other being Camp Bucca , near Umm Qasr in the south of the country , which holds an estimated 15,000 detainees .
Executed former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein spent time there , including for medical treatment , although the US military says he was never under Col Steele 's responsibility .
US detention facilities in Iraq have been the target of sustained criticism for holding detainees without charge and for widespread abuse of prisoners .
The worst controversy was in the first year of the US occupation of Iraq , when it was revealed that guards abused prisoners at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison on the outskirts of Baghdad .
Like plants that grow toward the sun , dark fungi , blackened by the skin pigment melanin , gravitate toward radiation in contaminated soil .
Scientists have observed the organisms — somewhere between plants and animals — blackening the land around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine in the years since its 1986 meltdown .
" Organisms that make melanin have a growth advantage in this soil , " says microbiologist Arturo Casadevall of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City .
" In many commercial nuclear reactors , the radioactive water becomes contaminated with melanotic organisms .
Nobody really knows what the hell they are doing there . "
Casadevall and his colleagues , however , have a theory .
Based on experiments with three different types of fungi , they believe the melanin - containing breeds absorb the high levels of energy in ionizing radiation and somehow turn it into a biologically useful ( and benign ) form , akin to a dark and dangerous version of photosynthesis .
" We were able to see significant growth of the black ones relative to the white ones in a radiation field , " he says .
" That is the observation .
How you interpret it is where the interesting speculations come in . "
In a paper published online in PLoS One , Casadevall and his colleagues report that ionizing radiation changes the electron structure of the melanin molecule and that fungi with a natural melanin shell ( the soil - dwelling Cladosporium sphaerospermum and yeastlike Wangiella dermatitidis varieties ) , which were deprived of other nutrients , grew better in the presence of radiation .
They also report that fungi induced to produce a melanin shell ( the human pathogen Cryptococcocus neoformans ) grew well in such levels of radiation , unlike those sans pigment .
Further , an albino mutant strain of W. dermatitidis failed to thrive as well as its black cousin when exposed to 500 times the normal amount of ionizing radiation ( still well below the level of radiation necessary to kill tough fungal forms ) .
" The presumption has always been that we do n't know why truffles and other fungi are black , " Casadevall says .
" If they have some primitive capacity to harvest sunlight or to harvest some kind of background radiation a lot of them would be using it . "
Melanin drinks in ultraviolet rays , acting as a natural sunblock for human skin .
" Melanin is very good at absorbing energy and then dissipating it as quickly as possible , " says Jennifer Riesz , a biophysicist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane , Australia .
" It does this by very efficiently changing the energy into heat . "
But Casadevall and his colleague Ekaterina Dadachova , a nuclear chemist at Einstein , speculate that the melanin in this case acts like a step - down electric transformer , weakening the energy until it is useable by the fungi .
" The energy becomes low [ at ] a certain point where it can already be used by a fungus as chemical energy , " Dadachova argues .
" Protection does n't play a role here .
It is real energy conversion . "
Mycologists and biophysicists find the notion both intriguing and potentially plausible .
" Since melanin is used commonly by fungi — and other organisms — to protect themselves against UV radiation , it is perhaps not surprising that melanin would be affected by ionizing radiation , '' says Albert Torzilli , a mycologist at George Mason University in Virginia , adding that " the subsequent enhancement of growth , if true , is a novel response . "
Riesz , for one , is skeptical .
" It does not surprise me that fungi protected with higher levels of melanin might grow better when exposed to [ ionizing radiation ] , since the nonprotected fungi are more likely to be harmed by the radiation , " she says .
" However , I find the claim that melanin is involved in energy capture and utilization to be unlikely . "
More study is needed to confirm whether fungi will be able to add the ability to grow by harvesting radiation to their list of seeming superpowers , but it does raise the question of whether edible fungi — like mushrooms — have been harboring this function undiscovered for years .
If true , melanin could be genetically engineered into photosynthetic plants to boost their productivity or melanin - bearing fungi could be used in clothing to shield workers from radiation or even farmed in space as astronaut food .
The group plans further tests to see if fungi with melanin are converting other wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum into energy , as well .
" [ Melanin ] does n't reflect any light ; it 's all going into it .
Is it all disappearing into a black pigment and has no use whatsoever ?
Biology is incredibly inventive , " Casadevall argues .
After all , extremophile microbes thrive in the heat and acid of hydrothermal vents below the sea or live off the radiation of decaying radioactive rocks deep inside Earth 's crust .
" It 's not that outlandish , " Casadevall says , for fungi to harvest the energy in ionizing radiation with the help of melanin .
But it is unexpected and strange .
Think way back to elementary or primary school , somewhere around third - grade physical science , when you first learned about the various states of matter .
At the time you were undoubtedly told that there were three states of matter : solid , liquid , and gas .
Solid is where the atoms are tightly packed into some arrangement and vibrate in place ; liquids have more freedom of motion and vibration , allowing them to take on any bulk shape ; gas molecules had near complete freedom of motion and rarely saw another molecule .
Perhaps later you learned about plasma ( molecules where the electrons have been completely stripped from the nucleus ) as a fourth state , but for most people their education regarding states of matter ends around there .
New work by a pair of theoretical physicists studying an odd quantum mechanical effect may reveal a new state of matter , and if their model is shown to be accurate , it will completely change how we view the universe .
Quasi - particles
About ten years ago the Nobel Prize in physics went to a team for their discovery of what they termed quasi- particles .
These were particles that seemed to have a fractional charge , something that should not be possible according to physics .
They were seen in an experiment where electrons moved across an interface between two semiconducting materials , and they behaved as though they did not have an integer charge on them .
This phenomena , termed the fractional quantum Hall effect ( FQHE ) , suggested that electrons are NOT a fundamental particle in our universe .
Were this to be true , much of physics would need to be rethought .
However , it was found that this observed fractional charge was due to the positions of a group of electrons near one another .
This positioning gave the illusion of a fractional charge .
The charge on the electron was correct and physics could rest easy .
This idea of quasi - particles clearly intrigued people ; Xiao - Gang Wen at MIT and Michael Levin at Harvard University began to look at this in further detail .
They felt that the electrons in this arrangement could represent a new state of matter .
According to Wen , when you look at the electrons in the FQHE system , they appear in a random position similar to a liquid .
However , the electrons move in a well - correlated manner , as if they were all entangled .
Wen speculated that this potentially new state of matter is one where quantum entanglement is a basic property .
String - nets
Using this idea , Wen and Levin postulated something incredible : what if electrons were not fundamental particles , but merely the ends of long strings of other " true " fundamental particles ?
With this idea , the pair developed a new model for matter where it was made up of these strings woven together to form what they dubbed " string - nets . "
Developing and running computer simulations of this model showed that it gave rise to both conventional particles as well as the quasi- particles , those which carried a fractional charge that began this whole adventure .
Then they discovered something completely unexpected .
As the " string - net " vibrated , it produced waves as any vibrating net would , but the pair soon realized that the waves being emitted by the " string - net " behaved exactly as they would according to Maxwell 's equations — the set of equations that describe how electromagnetic radiation behaves !
As Wen himself says " A hundred and fifty years after Maxwell wrote them down , here they emerged by accident . "
While a huge success , the model did n't stop there :
Wen and Levin showed that the model could give rise to quarks — which make up protons and neutrons — as well as the force particles : gluons and W and Z bosons !
From here , the researchers made a huge leap to suggest that this model may be capable of explaining the structure of the universe .
If it can explain how both light and matter can be formed from the vacuum of space , perhaps they are onto something big .
( Prof .
Wen 's lecture on this topic is available online . )
At this point any good scientist will be reading with a grain of salt ; it is n't every day that someone suggests that what physics considers as the basic building blocks of the universe are called into question .
Many did .
According to Michael Freedman , winner of the Fields medal in 1986 and quantum computing expert at Microsoft , " Wen and Levin 's theory is really beautiful stuff .
I admire their approach , which is to be suspicious of anything –electrons , photons , Maxwell 's equations –that everyone else accepts as fundamental . "
A very unusual mineral
While this could have been relegated to wherever science puts the many other theories that have tried to explain the universe , this idea received a big boost from an unlikely source .
In 1972 geologists unearthed a new type of mineral in Chile ; this mineral , now known as herbertsmithite , has a very unusual property : its electrons are arranged in a triangular lattice .
This is atypical since electrons usually line up in pairs so they can have the opposite spin as their nearest neighbor .
In a triangle , two neighbors will be forced to have the same spin .
According to Wen and Levin , this ternary electron system would be a string - net liquid , their new state of matter .
Recently another group at MIT who were aware of Wen and Levin 's theory started trying to synthesize this material , herbertsmithite , without defects so it could be studied in detail .
After achieving the goal of growing the mineral , they began to characterize it and found that it was unlike many other minerals on Earth .
Most minerals exhibit what is called magnetic ordering — where the electron spins in a lattice line up .
In the synthesized material no such ordering was found no matter how cold they made the crystal .
Even at a fraction of a degree Kelvin , no magnetic order appeared .
The team also measured the heat capacity of the material ; often this will change below a certain temperature due to a structural change in the material .
Again , no such change was found even down to incredibly low temperatures .
According to Y. S. Lee , the MIT professor who oversees the lab where the herbertsmithite was synthesized , " We could have created something in the lab that nobody has seen before . "
Further studies into the details of the possible entanglement properties of this material are being undertaken now .
The team , led by Prof .
Lee , is firing neutrons into the material to see if there is any long - range correlation in the motion of the electrons , indicating some degree of entanglement .
While these are both radical concepts — one challenges the very fundamentals of physics while the other suggesting a type of material never before studied — the experiments and theories are in the early stages .
Even if they do not pan out , it is worth noting that there are many other groups around the world looking for new states of matter every day .
Michael Freedman rightly notes that often people think new states of matter only occur in the high temperatures and energies of particle accelerators which , as he puts , " are just recreating conditions after the big bang and repeating experiments that are old hat for the universe . "
New materials and theories are being discovered all the time .

Always smile with your teeth , because you would never laugh at a funny joke with your lips together .
True smiles show off a toothy grin , not tightly pressed lips .
Keep your face natural by allowing a real smile to peak through . [ 3 ]
When you are showing emotions your entire face is affected .
Although many people associate a look of happiness with just a smile , your eyebrows , eyes , cheeks , and forehead are all affected equally as much .
Make sure that you are allowing freedom of movement in your entire face .
It is easy to spot someone who is photogenic from someone who is posing ; the former does n’t have to fake their emotions .
Although getting your photo taken can be nerve - wrecking , do n’t let it get in the way of your true feelings .
Do n’t create the smile you think you need , use your regular smile .
The same goes with the shape of your eyes and the curve of your cheeks .
The more you allow your natural emotions to show on your face , the better your pictures will look .
What 's the problem ?
What kind of behavior is okay ?
Prioritizing all applications of a certain general type , such as streaming video ;
Managing their networks to , for example , block certain traffic based on IP address in order to prevent harmful denial of service ( DOS ) attacks , viruses or worms ;
Employing certain upgrades , such as the use of local caching or private network backbone links ;
Providing managed IP services and proprietary content ( like IPTV ) ; and
Charging consumers extra to receive higher speed or performance capacity broadband service .
What is n't okay ?
Levying surcharges on content providers that are not their retail customers ;
Prioritizing data packet delivery based on the ownership or affiliation ( the who ) of the content , or the source or destination ( the what ) of the content ; or
Building a new " fast lane " online that consigns Internet content and applications to a relatively slow , bandwidth - starved portion of the broadband connection .
What should be done ?
If you 've ever tried copying and pasting a multi-line address into Google Maps just to realize that an input box will only take one line at a time — meaning that you have to copy and paste each line individually — there 's a simple Firefox tweak that will solve this problem :
Type " about : config " in the location bar .
In the " Filter " field type " singleline . "
You can set the value to 2 for editor.
singleLine.pasteNewlines , which will allow pasting of multiple lines to input boxes .

Of course , this tweak works for any input box , so if you 've bumped up against the multi- line paste problem elsewhere , consider it a problem of the past .

My startup history goes back a few years .
In 5th grade I sold comic books to my classmates at a 30 - 40 % markup .
I was a voracious marketer ; I handed out homemade flyers , created checklists so customers could see “ at - a - glance ” which issues they needed , and even started a subscription service .
Whenever kids in my school had extra money the first thing they thought of was buying comics .
In 8th grade I sold candy at a 500 - 800 % markup because kids could n’t buy it within walking distance of school .
I made money hand over fist , and quickly learned that you should re-invest your profits instead of purchasing DJ equipment that you think will make you cool , but will actually collect dust in the back room of your house because you never spend the time to perfect your cross -fade .
In high school I wrote a booklet about comic collecting and sold it through classified ads .
Technically I broke even , but realistically I lost money on the 50 + unpaid hours I spent researching and writing .
This was the first business I launched “ in the wild , ” and I learned a lot about what it takes to market a product in the real world ( i.e. , to someone other than my classmates ) .
During college I sold $ 5,000 worth of comic books on newsgroups and eBay ( this was circa 1997 , when eBay was still black and white and so slow you had to snipe 40 seconds before the auction ended or your bid would n’t hit the servers in time ) .
This business funded my entertainment expenses for two years .
I had many Silver Age books that were some of the few copies for sale on the internet at the time .
Fresh out of college I started an ISP with my best friend .
We closed down after a few months , but the technical experience we gained resulted in lucrative web development jobs for both of us .
Lessons learned so far ?
Be the sole source , market like hell , go for big markup , and learn something from your business .
These are basic business principles , but I learned them from hard - knox experience by the time I was 22 .
Several years later I started my consulting firm , The Numa Group , which has been going strong in one form or another for five years .
In the past two years I ’ve found time to build and launch FeedShot , Flogz ( now defunct ) , and buy and sell an ASP .
NET discussion forum package called ChitChat .
NET ( now owned by Moon River Software ) .
But the next entry in this saga , an ASP.
NET billing software package , is quite a story .
So let me start from the beginning .
Two Types of Leverage
There are two types of leverage : people and products1 .
A consulting firm leverages people .
The employees work for a lower rate than the company bills , and the owners keep the difference .
Leveraging people is lucrative if you can hire good people and keep them busy .
There is little up - front risk as the company is ( theoretically ) paid by the client for most hours an employee works .
The downside is that resource loading is difficult and you often wind up with people who are too busy , or not busy enough .
Consulting firms are also notoriously hard to sell .
I was talking about leverage with Joel Spolsky at one of his recent appearances on the FogBugz World Tour ( yes , that was a conspicuous name drop ) , and he nailed it : “ The problem with consulting is that you ca n’t find people who are as good as you . ”
You may find a few , but the better they are , the more likely they are to go off on their own .
So your growth , and thus your leverage , is limited by personnel ( one of those human sides of software people keep talking about ) .
Now to product leverage : Microsoft , Oracle , and PeopleSoft are examples of companies that leverage products .
They invest in building a product once , and then sell it to many customers .
Leveraging products is extremely lucrative if you can sell enough copies to make back your initial investment , knows as “ sunk costs . ”
Knowing how to market software , which I ’m convinced is some kind of freaky black art , is crucial to generating enough sales .
One of the benefits of a product company is that it can be sold more easily than a consulting firm .
The downside is that the investment to bring a product to market can be sizable , and typically requires outside funding ( or , for a smaller product , a lot of evenings and weekends ) , and that freaky black art of software marketing is harder than you think .
What ’s Next ?
I come from the consulting world ; I worked for small consulting firms on and off for five years .
Climbing the ranks in consulting is obvious if you work for a large firm , but there ’s not much room to advance in a six person company .
Seeking to learn more about the business side of things and to take the next step in my career , I started The Numa Group in 2002 and we are now a thriving three - person .NET development shop .
And in the midst of all this I ’ve been looking for new skills to augment my consulting background ; something new to keep the fire burning as brightly as in the early years of my career .
The Product
Earlier this year I was scanning through a forum and came across a developer who was looking for marketing help .
He and a partner had written an ASP.
NET invoicing package that was selling reasonably well , but they knew someone with more marketing experience could have a serious impact on sales .
I looked at the online demo and I was blown away .
The UI was simple , clean , filled with AJAX , and the product was easy to use .
The first thought that ran through my head ?
Buy it .
An ASP.NET invoicing package was one of the ideas in my product idea notebook , and buying the application would eliminate one of the major drawbacks to leveraging a product : the initial investment to bring it to market .
So I emailed the developer to see if he ’d be interested in selling .
( To be continued … )
==========
1 . A third type of leverage is n’t really leverage .
Some people say you can leverage fame or popularity .
Someone who writes books and articles can become a household names in a software community and command a high hourly rate for their consulting services .
While it ’s true they can make substantially more money than their colleagues there is a limit to their earning potential , and that ’s why it ’s not truly leverage .
Leverage scales .
You can hire 10 or 1,000 consultants , or sell 10,000 or 100,000 copies of your software and earn egregious amounts of money without substantially more work .
But no matter how much popularity someone achieves , their hourly rate will hit a cap , and they will still work 1 hour for x dollars .
This is not a bad thing , mind you , it ’s just that it does n’t fit my definition of leverage .

Plasma screens are getting bigger in size and energy consumption
Professor Paul Ekins , who studies the economics of climate change , said taxing plasma screens would reflect their " greater climate change burden " .
This would encourage development and take - up of more energy - efficient diode screens , Professor Ekins said .
He said government should label energy - hungry appliances as a first step .
Plasma televisions , which are 50 % bigger than their cathode - ray tube equivalents , consume about four times more energy , according to the government - funded Energy Saving Trust .
The first thing for government to do is say these kinds of energy - intensive appliances are very climate - unfriendly
Prof Paul Ekins , University of Westminster
But some researchers say exact comparisons are difficult because of the size difference between plasmas and other screen types : cathode - ray tube and Liquid Crystal Display ( LCD ) .
" At the very least you might think that government would provide some differential incentives to accelerate the development of more energy - efficient diode screens and encourage their take - up , " said Professor Ekins , co-director of the UK Energy Research Centre ( UKERC ) .
" Once plasma screens are bought , they are likely to be there for five years at a minimum - perhaps 10 years , perhaps longer . "
Organic Light - Emitting Diode ( OLED ) screens do not require a backlight and thus draw less power .
But observers say the technology needs to overcome several technological hurdles , such as the limited lifetimes of some of the materials used in them .
Energy demand
Professor Ekins was speaking at a news conference in London held to discuss issues around the government 's forthcoming Energy White Paper , including how to promote energy efficiency while reducing demand .
The White Paper is expected to be released in the next few weeks .
He also singled out patio heaters as especially energy - intensive .
The economist , who is also professor of sustainable development at the University of Westminster , said he would personally like to see taxation on energy - intensive appliances such as these - and added : " The first thing for government to do is say these kinds of energy - intensive appliances are very climate - unfriendly .
" They ought to be labelled as such and then there needs to be a detailed policy analysis , which in my experience has not been done , to determine what is the best way to deter their take - up and to develop more climate - friendly substitutes . "
He added : " Unless we have policy mechanisms of that kind we will not reduce energy demand sufficiently to achieve the kinds of reductions in carbon emissions that currently are the subject of the Climate Change Bill and are going to be signed into statute if that bill goes through . "
But Robert Gross , head of technology and policy assessment at UKERC , said debates on energy efficiency could become too pre-occupied by prices and incentives .
" When you are looking at consumer appliances , buildings and vehicles and you are looking at people not responding very well to price - based incentives - for a variety of reasons - there 's an absolutely fundamental role for straightforward legislation to improve the efficiency of these devices , " he told journalists .
A survey of the five most populous European nations , carried out by the Energy Saving Trust , found that Britons were the worst energy wasters in Europe , with bad habits which could cost £ 11bn by 2010 .

What ’s New in Python ¶
The “ What ’s New in Python ” series of essays takes tours through the most important changes between major Python versions .
They are a “ must read ” for anyone wishing to stay up - to - date after a new release .
The “ Changelog ” is an HTML version of the file built from the contents of the Misc / NEWS.d directory tree , which contains all nontrivial changes to Python for the current version .
ANDERSEN AIR FORCE BASE , Guam 
To take part in its annual exercises with the United States Air Force here last month , Japan practiced dropping 500 - pound live bombs on Farallon de Medinilla , a tiny island in the western Pacific ’s turquoise waters more than 150 miles north of here .
The pilots described dropping a live bomb for the first time  shouting “ shack ! ” to signal a direct hit  and seeing the fireball from aloft .
“ The level of tension was just different , ” said Capt .
Tetsuya Nagata , 35 , stepping down from his cockpit onto the sunbaked tarmac .
The exercise would have been unremarkable for almost any other military , but it was highly significant for Japan , a country still restrained by a Constitution that renounces war and allows forces only for its defense .
Dropping live bombs on land had long been considered too offensive , so much so that Japan does not have a single live - bombing range .
The Joint Committee on Taxation today released Description of Revenue Provisions Contained in the President 's Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Proposal ( JCS - 2-07 ) :
This document , prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation , provides a description and analysis of the revenue provisions modifying the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ( the “ Code ” ) that are contained in the President ’s fiscal year 2008 budget proposal , as submitted to the Congress on February 5 , 2007 .
The document generally follows the order of the proposals as included in the Department of the Treasury ’s explanation of the President ’s budget proposal .
For each provision , there is a description of present law and the proposal ( including effective date ) , a reference to relevant prior budget proposals or recent legislative action , and an analysis of policy issues related to the proposal .
FLOATING through the snow in their tinted - windowed SUVs , shrouded in baubles and whispered fears of losing it all , the Russian rich sometimes sense that their imaginations are not as outlandish as their offshore bank accounts .
And so they turn to Sergei Knyazev .
They call him the “ producer . ”
He loves saying that ; he even embossed it on his business card .
But he ’s really more of a psychologist - turned - opportunist , ready to help “ the overburdened rich relieve the pressure of money and its obligations . ”
“ They just do n’t know how to relax , ” he says .
“ I help them .
I ’m outrageously expensive .
These people do n’t trust anything that ’s not expensive . ”
To be so mercenary and truthful in a single breath -- refreshing , yet spooky .
But this is Russia , home to billionaires and unbridled egos , a neurotic , champagne - scented landscape of black suits , diamonds , gadgets and guns all loose amid the moneyed classes with their big dogs and security men .
Advertisement
Knyazev began conventionally enough , arranging parties and banquets several years ago for the ice - sculpture - and - caviar circuit .
But how many long tables , embroidered linens , fluted crystal , Moet bubbles and vanity portraits must a multimillionaire endure ?
Spinning capitalist schemes and pocketing oil and gas wealth , the new oligarchs craved more .
They wanted to be intrigued ; they wanted their sequins rattled .
“ I now do entertainment of all kinds , from the pretty exotic to the really indecent .
What do you want to talk about ? ”
The really indecent , of course , but let ’s go slow .
“ Once I had a client who twice proposed to a girl and each time she turned him down .
He did n’t want to be rejected a third time , so he came to me .
He was very wealthy , old Russian money .
The girl ’s name was Olga .
I found out where she lived .
It was a new house , and the grounds outside had not yet been landscaped .
So one night , while she was sleeping , we turned it into a big garden with beautiful flowers spelling out her name .
Big letters .
The ‘ O ’ was so big that you could fit two cars inside of it .
Advertisement
“ In the morning the boyfriend was standing in the garden with an orchestra .
They played a serenade ....
She looked out the window .
Three months later , they married . ”
Charming , that Olga thing , very “ Sleepless in Seattle , ” but how about something with a bit more edge ?
Knyazev smiles , a mischievous glimmer of the teeth .
It is a self - satisfied smirk that says : “ You want more ?
I ’ve got a whole lot more . ”
“ I make up games .
Sometimes I dress up my clients like bums and take them to the rail station .
They have to beg .
Whoever has the most coins in the morning wins , ” he says .
“ The wives of these businessmen wanted their own games .
So we had some of them work as waitresses in a diner .
Whoever gets the most tips wins .
Sometimes they ’ll go as striptease dancers and see who comes away with the most cash . ”

He looks down , scratches his thin goatee , reflects : “ Some very rich women want to play the part of a prostitute .
I organize that .
Of course , they do n’t go all the way .
We stop it before that ....
But , yes , some would go all the way . ”
He pauses , adding , in his best Sigmund Freud : “ Why do they want to do these things ?
Deep down they ’re driven by a fear that one day they might end up a beggar , a prostitute , because for many of them , their businesses are n’t that clean . ”
*
THE guy is wonderful , a wily bit of flash , a symbol of the new Russia .
Knyazev came of age , economically speaking , in the late 1980s , when then - Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for reforms known as perestroika .
It was a time of cigar smoke and dreams .
He opened a student cafe , a private school and an advertising agency in Siberia .
He later ventured to Moscow , founding the Empire of Passion strip club and hiring a former Bolshoi ballerina to teach dance steps .

The thing about Knyazev , 44 , is that you wonder where he draws the border between fantasy and reality .
He runs with the rich , but there are no chandeliers , no Botticelli knockoffs floating in his chamber , which resembles a dentist ’s office -- long hallway , closing doors , muffled voices .
His pinstriped suit is subtle , but it is not Armani .
You get the sense of being lured into a web of meticulously constructed origami .
“ I know Sergei Knyazev and I ’ve heard his stories about some bizarre games he invents for rich businessmen .
What can I tell you ? ” says Konstantin N. Borovoi , a founder of Moscow ’s commodities exchange and chairman of the Party of Economic Freedom .
“ There is no way to verify that because he wo n’t disclose the names of his clients .
But really , some of his tales are hard to believe .
All I can say is that Knyazev is surely not lacking in imagination . ”
Confidentiality breeds mystique .
Finding out who ’s who , or , more important , who ’s doing what , is tough anyway .
This is a nation where credit cards were decades late in arriving , where money was smuggled out or funneled to foreign banks .
Financial searches today often lead into mazes , and many firms rely on criminal background checks and the website Kompromat.ru ( Compromising Material ) , a thicket of rumors and gossip about the rich and powerful .
“ I will not reveal the names of my clients , ” Knyazev says .
Advertisement
His potential roster brims with possibility .
Russia ’s richest person , Oleg Deripaska , a 39 - year - old aluminum tycoon , is worth $ 21.2 billion , according to Finans magazine .
Seven of the country ’s top 10 billionaires were born in the 1960s , mostly young men who found fortune a decade or so ago in a mesmerizing privatization boom that mixed rough glamour , hidden bank accounts and brazen entrepreneurs , such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who ran afoul of the Kremlin and today sits in a Siberian jail convicted of tax evasion and fraud .
*
THESE days , new money seeks old - fashioned respect .
Bankers still get gunned down and businessmen tend to disappear , but the tenor is decidedly softer as at least a facade of legitimacy has been constructed around oil and gas companies , mining firms and other industries .
Still , conspicuous consumption rules ; the country ’s average monthly income is about $ 330 , but that does n’t hinder the rich from their bejeweled eccentricities .
Like Knyazev and his entourage across town , Irina Volskaya is accustomed to extravagant requests .
She heads the Russian office of Quintessentially , a worldwide concierge , make - it - happen service whose founders include the nephew of Camilla Parker Bowles .
With bronze - colored boots and cameo jewelry , Volskaya is a study in calm and confidence , a woman used to dealing with big wallets and short tempers .

“ Once a Russian guy called on Dec. 26 , ” she says .
“ He was having a party and wanted 150 silver - plated pigs delivered to celebrate the new year .
This was a problem because everything was sold out .
But this was not the only problem .
He also wanted 150 live pigs to give to each of his guests .
Finding 150 little pink pigs on Dec. 26 is a struggle ....
We have no limits , though .
One of our rules is never say no . ”
Then there was the millionaire in the plane .
“ The client calls : ‘ You know I ’m in my private jet just over a European country and the airport is closed .
Please help me . ’
But really , what do you say ?
The airport is closed for everybody .
But we did help him .
One person in one country called another person in another country .
It ’s all about connections . ”
*
KNYAZEV does n’t like to be outdone .
He has another story .
Cue violins .
Advertisement
“ One client had a little daughter , ” he says .
“ Her birthday was in seven days and he wanted it to be special .
So we made a magic tree that would grow two meters a day until her birthday .
” Each morning she came out to see it had grown .
We had to bring in a new , taller tree every night .
We used seven trees , and on her birthday the last one was filled with pineapples and oranges . ”
His favorite tale , though , is based on the movie “ The Game , ” in which Michael Douglas plays a very rich man with a hollow life .
His brother orders him a fantasy , a psychological thriller of a game that once started ca n’t be controlled or predicted .
Knyazev ’s game involved a construction magnate , planted drugs , a false arrest , actors , police cars , a jail , a meeting at the Kremlin and a bogus letter written by the queen of England .
The cost : $ 300,000 .
Advertisement
Is Knyazev telling the truth ?
Is he not ?
That ’s the strange , beguiling beauty of the new Russia .
“ My country , I must say , is rich in personality .
Our people have always been interesting and original , ” Knyazev says .
“ And now comes the epoch when such personalities can realize themselves . ”

Fleishman was recently on assignment in Moscow .
Friends of the current president have recalled how they occasionally saw Mexican workers in his father ’s oil fields , part of a steady trickle of new immigrants from the other side of the Southern border who also took jobs as ranch hands , maids and groundskeepers .
Image Luz Reyes , owner of Doña Anitas Mexican restaurant , at the table where George W. Bush ate most Friday evenings while he lived in Midland , Tex .
Some Republicans boycotted her restaurant in 2006 for a position she took on immigration .
Credit ... Erin Trieb for The New York Times
Randall Roden , one of Mr. Bush ’s close childhood friends , recalled an upbringing that included “ being aware that there were people who were poor and hard - working , and just looking for better opportunity , and a chance to do just about anything . ”
Joe O’Neill , another friend from the time who remains close with Mr. Bush to this day and who helped introduce Mr. Bush to the first lady , said of the newcomers , “ They were hard - working and they were usually very close families — there was generally a father and a mother at home ; you noticed it . ”
Mr. Bush ’s closest boyhood contact with anyone of Hispanic descent seems to have been in Houston , where the Bushes moved when George W. Bush was in middle school , two years before he went to boarding school at Andover in Massachusetts .
His mother sought household help in the local paper , and answered an advertisement for a Mexican woman who was seeking sponsorship in return for housekeeping services .
The woman , Paula Rendon , moved in and has stayed on with the Bush family for decades , following George H.W. and Barbara Bush to the White House and back home .
The current president has mentioned her only rarely , but he has described her as “ a second mother . ”
Mr. Bush declined several interview requests .
But in a brief e-mail exchange , Mr. Bush ’s younger brother Jeb said of Ms. Rendon , “ I adore her , ” and added , “ I got pretty good at Spanish thanks to her . ”
But , he said , he became fluent through his wife , Columba , with whom he has three children whom George H. W. Bush once famously , and affectionately , called “ the little brown ones . ”
The Son Returns
Mr. Bush returned to Midland in 1975 to find a much more Hispanic town than the one he left behind , because of an influx of Mexicans who went there to cash in on the 1970s oil boom just as Mr. Bush did .

Above , the " Aura of Sauron " .
It looks unreal but there is no " photoshopping " anywhere on this website .
All my photos are single exposures with very little post processing ie real photos .
The effects come from doing things during the exposure which can be striking particularly if the source of sparks have shifted or rotated as above .
Above is an animated gif showing the effects of rotating the rod on top .
In real time it takes 7 seconds per rotation .

To make this picture with a single long exposure , open the shutter and take the flash photo above .
Then run away ( in darkness so it is not recorded on the camera with shutter still open ) .
Turn on the a few seconds of Tesla coil sparks onto the globe .

As I wrote on Wednesday , the misnamed Iowans for Tax Relief and the Iowa Christian Alliance ( ICA ) have chosen to exclude Ron Paul from their candidates ’ forum on June 30 .
There is more to report .
I ’ve received emails from people telling me that the folks at the ICA insist that they had nothing to do with excluding Dr. Paul , and that the blame rests with Ed Failor of Iowans for Tax Relief .
( Ed ’s not too popular with a lot of people these days , apparently . )
Now I have no doubt that there may be some decent people at the ICA , and that they may really believe what they are saying .
But that organization cannot possibly be believed when it innocently claims it has nothing against Ron Paul .
The ICA has a page on its site that lists all the announced candidates for president .
Here is the link .
Until yesterday , when I pointed it out on the LRC blog and embarrassed them a bit , there was no Ron Paul .
Now look at the list again .
Ever heard of Hugh Cort ?
John Cox ?
Mark Klein ?
The people at the ICA evidently have , since there they are on the list .
But they apparently had n’t heard of Ron Paul until just yesterday .
Actually , though , they did know who Ron Paul was .
They even used to have him on their list , as this Google cache shows .
But then he disappeared .
They also used to have a link to Paul ’s YouTube site , along with those of the other candidates , at the bottom of the page , but that ’s also been suppressed .
So if they thought they could claim that deleting the link to Ron Paul ’s campaign site was some kind of innocent mistake , that is n’t going to work .
Heck , they even include a list of " potential " candidates .
That list includes Al Sharpton .
So Al Sharpton merits inclusion , but Ron Paul does not .
There is the faith of the apostles , according to the Iowa Christian Alliance .
Now let ’s return to my other favorite Iowa organization , the Iowans ( Allegedly ) for Tax Relief .
Its executive vice president , Ed Failor , was n’t happy about my LRC article on Wednesday .
Not happy at all .
In fact , he called me on Wednesday and insisted that I correct something I ’d said — that by replacing Jim Gilmore with Duncan Hunter at the last minute ( a fact I discovered by comparing press releases from earlier this month ) , Iowans for Tax Relief implicitly revealed that the reason they were excluding Ron Paul — that the event had supposedly been organized months ago and was now cast in stone — was bogus , and a lie .
Here is the earth - shattering change Failor wanted me to make .
Hunter , he said , had been one of the original invitees — man , these guys are just great at picking out the credible candidates , are n’t they ? — but failed to respond by the deadline .
So when Gilmore dropped out , they went back to Hunter , who accepted .
But if they really wanted " credible " candidates , why would they do such a thing ?
By now even the zombie population can see that Ron Paul is far more credible than Hunter by any measure .
The comparison is almost laughable .
And since Hunter had his chance to participate but elected not to respond , why not give Paul a chance , since his initial exclusion — on the ludicrous grounds that he was not a " credible " candidate — has subsequently been shown to be a gross misjudgment ?
Paul seems particularly “ credible ” given that he came in second behind Fred Thompson in a straw poll that Iowans for Tax Relief itself co-sponsored !
Meanwhile , with Failor ’s technicality off his chest , he had absolutely nothing to say about 99 percent of what I wrote : he never denied his support for the execrable George Pataki ( what non -hack ever supported Pataki for anything , much less for president ? ) , his support for Pataki ’s spending increases , or his donations to the McCain campaign , for which Failor is a senior advisor .
The humorless Failor appeared on Jan Mickelson ’s radio program later that day in order to justify his organization ’s exclusion of Dr. Paul ; Ron Paul campaign manager Kent Snyder also appeared .
You can listen to it here .
My favorite part is Failor ’s claim that other non-credible candidates were n’t invited , either , so Ron Paul has n’t been treated unfairly .
And which candidates would those be ?
Why , Hugh Cort , John Cox , and Mark Klein , of course !
You can not make this stuff up .
The " Rudy McRomney " moniker is meant to suggest that the establishment ’s favorite Republican candidates are indistinguishable from each other , and that they collectively represent the same inoffensive commitment to nothing that characterizes the entire political mainstream .
As surely as the sun will rise tomorrow , electing one of these men means absolutely nothing will change .
Of that you can be certain .
And that ’s just the way Ed Failor , Rudy McRomney supporter , evidently likes it .
No Ron Paul revolution for him .
Who needs a revolution when you can vote for John McCain and get a slightly more maniacal status quo ?
This is the man who sits in judgment of Ron Paul ?
And no , Ed , I do n’t buy your phony explanation .
Neither does anyone with an IQ over 75 .

Python framework design
Lately I ’ve found myself being baited into the same old debate over and over and over again , and I ’m getting tired of making the same arguments each time .
Usually it begins with someone lamenting how Django is anti-community or too inflexible or generally suffering from a raging case of NIH .
From there it progresses into people proclaiming how TurboGears or ( more often )
Pylons is objectively “ better ” because of how they ’re designed , and how it would be nice for Django to follow their lead .
Before I go any further , I ’d like you to go watch Malcolm Gladwell ’s 2004 TED talk .
He ’s going to talk about Pepsi and pickles and spaghetti sauce and mustard , but you should watch the whole thing because it has a relevant lesson for the Python web framework world :
There is no perfect Python web framework .
There are only different Python web frameworks that suit different kinds of people .
Horizontal segmentation
Fundamentally , there are two ways you can go about building a Python web framework ; I ’m going to refer to them as “ full - stack ” and “ glue ” .
In a nutshell :
A full - stack framework ’s primary goals are to provide a single set of components , covering the entire spectrum of things you ’ll need to build web applications , and to ensure that those components work well with one another .
A glue framework ’s primary goals are to provide a set of adapters and interface code which can handle many different components in each part of the stack , and to ensure that those adapters work well with as many different combinations of components as possible .
The choice of methodology here will affect every aspect of the eventual framework , and no matter how hard the developers try , they will never be able to mask that from end users of the frameworks .
Django is a full - stack framework .
Pylons and TurboGears are glue frameworks .
These are fundamentally different approaches to building a framework , and they are both perfectly valid ; the developers behind them have made a conscious choice about which approach they prefer , and put all their time and energy into fulfilling the goals of that approach .
Web developers — the end users of web frameworks — also tend to have a preferred approach , and will naturally congregate around a framework which suits their preference .
There will always be framework developers who prefer the full - stack and there will always be framework developers who prefer glue .
There will also always be web developers in each camp .
Thus there will always be a market for both kinds of frameworks .
There is no perfect framework .
There are only different frameworks that suit different kinds of people .
But they ’re wrong !
Also , there will always be people in both camps who are utterly , steadfastly convinced that they are objectively right and the other group is objectively wrong .
I expect that with time , full - stack versus glue will become one of the great holy wars of the Python web - development community ( and it probably already has ) .
People in the full - stack camp will go on and on about how glue frameworks do n’t really give you a clear roadmap ; sure , they may have a default configuration which pre-selects a particular set of components , but that does n’t really mean much and the tutorials and documentation will have to be fragmented according to which template engine or which ORM you use , and you ’ll have to go hunt up all these other projects and read their manuals , and it ’s just icky .
Those people will be wrong .
A glue framework is n’t terribly hard to learn , and if you do n’t want to research all the different options you can just go with the defaults , but the primary goal is n’t to give you just one set of components and say “ here it is ” .
And the ability to cherry - pick exactly the right set of components for a particular project is incredibly powerful .
It ’s like the world ’s most powerful Lego set ; you ’ve got blocks in all shapes and sizes , and you can build pretty much anything by combining them in just the right way .
People in the glue camp will go on and on about how full - stack frameworks are too inflexible ; sure , you can drop in another ORM or another template engine , but then you ’ll lose all the handy shortcuts and have to write more code .
And because they tend to develop their own components , they ’re not good community players — it ’d be so much better if they ’d just pull stuff off the shelf and contribute improvements back to other projects !
Those people will also be wrong .
A full - stack framework is n’t inflexible , it ’s just highly optimized for one set of components .
It ’s still easy to use others with it if you want to , but the primary goal is n’t to support every conceivable combination of components and say “ go pick what you want ” .
And having a full set of tested components that Just Work out of the box is incredibly powerful .
It ’s like having the greatest toolbox ever ; you ’ve got hammers and wrenches and screwdrivers and drills right there , and you can build pretty much anything by using them in just the right way .
The fact that all of these people are wrong will not stop any of them from continuing to maul each other in public over whose philosophy is better .
Ca n’t we do both ?
Unfortunately , I do n’t think so .
Taking one approach seems — though I could be proven wrong in time — to mean that so much of your time and effort will be spent on fulfilling the goals of that approach that you wo n’t be able to focus enough time and effort on the goals of the other , and if you try you ’ll end up looking like you did a half - assed job of it ;
Jack of all trades will be master of none .
A full - stack framework has to ensure that its components are of high quality and all work together ; that ’s a big enough job in itself without trying to make them work with any random thing somebody pulls off the shelf .
And a glue framework has to ensure that its adapters and interfaces scrupulously follow various standards and specifications ( like WSGI , which is not trivial to get right ) and work with as many components as possible ; that ’s a big enough job in itself without spending development time on maintaining a particular arbitrarily - chosen set of components .
And again , no matter how hard developers try , a full - stack framework is always going to obviously be a full - stack framework , and a glue framework is always going to obviously be a glue framework .
That fundamental choice of development methodology is going to affect every bit of code in the framework , and the particular strengths and weaknesses of each approach are always going to show through .
So this division will probably exist for as long as there are Python web frameworks .
Ca n’t we all get along ?
I ’d like to think so , but it ’s doubtful that it ’ll happen .
In an ideal world we ’d all realize that the choice of methodology comes down to subjective preference , and that it ’s a great thing to have the choice ;
Python web development would n’t be nearly as much fun if everyone were shackled into a single vision of the One True Framework ( even if Guido were to Pronounce on this , which he really has n’t — “ as standard as PIL ” is n’t much of a Pronouncement ) .
And in that ideal world the folks who like full - stack frameworks would hack on them and use them , and the people who like glue frameworks would hack on them and use them , and we ’d all come together and sing songs round the campfire about how much better off we are than those poor guys who are stuck with PHP .
But it ’s not an ideal world , and so we ’ll have the holy war and name - calling and FUD from both sides ( I ’ve certainly been guilty of it , and I ’m only hesitantly trying to reform ) , and in the end that only thing we ’ll agree on is the bit about PHP .
I ’d love to be proved wrong , though .
Anybody want to sing around the campfire and toast marshmallows with me after the web frameworks panel at PyCon ?
End users are still in for a bit of a wait , but tinkerers , devs , and 1337 hax0rz should soon be able to get their hands on FIC's Linux - based Neo1973 handset .
The device , getting thrown together courtesy of the OpenMoko project with the goal of open - sourcing both the phone and the platform , will drop first in $ 200 " Hacker 's Lunchbox " trim ( for the aforementioned hackers ) late this month featuring a seemingly bombproof plastic box to hold your GPLed bundle of joy and its dev tools .
This fall -- September , if OpenMoko 's prediction holds up -- the retail version will follow on for $ 350 with a variety of bundled accessories ( though not the pictured car mount , which 'll run an extra $ 75 ) , faster processor , and possibly a cam or integrated WiFi .
Why not both , FIC ?

China 's foreign exchange reserves have become a thorny issue for the government .
Experts around the world have suggested ways in which China might address the surplus of foreign exchange reserves .
However , many of these simply involve consuming the excess which could easily lead to inflation .
Any attempt to address the excess of foreign exchange reserves should incorporate a fundamental economic restructuring and an adjustment of the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism , which will be a long and slow process .
In the process the government can pursue some complementary policies to reduce its huge foreign currency reserves .
The author believes that raising gold holdings should be one of government 's strategic choices .
Gold has played a very important role in the international monetary system .
With the Demonetization of Gold , decided at a meeting in Jamaica in 1976 after the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system , the function of gold as a currency has been weakened and its status in the international reserve system fallen .
As a result , many countries and regions reduced their gold holdings .
However , following the Asian financial crisis , the US ' economic downturn and the depreciation of the dollar , gold once again has risen in importance .
Many countries have restored or even raised their gold holdings and adjusted the proportion of gold in their reserves , seeking a better role for gold in the modern economy .
Gold has several functions .
It can be a tool in a diversified investment portfolio and can spread investment risks .
Gold has high liquidity , high security and low profitability .
With a high liquidity , it can realize any market price freely .
This is compatible with the ability of reserve assets to deal with any unexpected economic difficulties .
Despite low profitability gold can have a very important hedging function .
It can be combined with some asset portfolios that are high risk but also high benefit , increasing investment benefits at the same level as risks .
Gold is also important in helping prevent inflation .
For emerging countries and markets , low interest rates , high oil prices and rampant fund speculation has increased the extent of inflation .
To curb the bubble economy that could arise from inflation , countries usually adopt macroeconomic controls such as increasing the interest rate .
Gold is another effective means of preventing inflation .
History shows that gold prices increase in sync with the rise of the inflation index and often in a higher range .
During deflation , the price of gold does not necessarily fall in line with the index , or by a lower margin .
In addition , holders of gold are able to meet their temporary funding needs in emergencies .
During its 1998 financial crisis in 1998 , Russia sold off 33 percent of its gold reserves .
In 2001 , to deal with a series of natural disasters that had befallen the country , it sold more of its gold holdings and invested the money into the reconstruction of Siberia .
During the Asian Financial Crisis , Malaysia , South Korea and Thailand all appealed to residents to convert their gold into local government bonds or to turn the gold they had collected directly into holdings or into dollars either to pay for the debt or to reduce risks .
This helped stabilize the local currencies .
Gold assets have unique features .
Gold holdings is an issue that concerns national sovereignty .
Every country has autonomous control of its gold .
Gold does not involve a liability , nor is it subject to any country 's economic policies , including the direct impact of monetary and fiscal policies .
China 's Central Bank says that China has 600 tons of gold holdings , equal to about 19.29 million ounces .
This figure has not changed since December 2002 .
China 's gold reserves account for only 1.3 percent of its total foreign exchange reserves , far lower than the 3 percent that is standard in other countries .
With the rapid growth of foreign exchange reserves , which now exceed US $ 1 trillion , the ratio of gold in China 's foreign exchange reserves is even lower .
In the long term , China should raise its gold holdings .
The price of gold has rebounded since April 2001 and a record high was set in May 2006 ï¿ ½C US $ 725 per ounce .
Currently an ounce of gold sells for approximately US $ 625 .
The price of gold has fluctuated but overall it remains high .
If China adopts a long - term strategic approach , accurately predict the market price of gold and purchase gold in a timely and reasonable manner , it can preserve and increase the value of gold , improve the reserve structure , and create a solid foundation for the internationalization of the RMB in the future .

I ’ve been sick for most of the week and last couple days I have had a really bad sore throat .
I had been sucking on cough drops and other common things to try to relieve my sore throat , but it kept getting worse and worse , to the point where I could barely manage to swallow .
As a kid I had tonsillitis and strep throat probably on average 5 - 6 times a year , but back then it was taboo to take your tonsils out so I spent a fair share of my time at the doctors office and on amoxicillin and other antibiotics .
Well I had n’t had strep in a long time and was worried that this had to be strep again .
I was just dying so as usual I went to the internet to find a solution .
Disclaimer : I am not a doctor and I am only posting this because I heard such great things about it and had such wonderful results myself , please consult with your physician before trying this magical elixir .
image by : AndrÃ© Karwath aka Aka
What I found was what appears to be a pretty fail safe cure for a sore throat over at earthclinic.com .
They recommend that you you gargle with Cayenne Powder .
Now before you think it ’s crazy , go ahead and read the 135 people or so that have commented on the site about their amazing results .
Believe me I was a little skeptical at first too and the thought of gargling with cayenne pepper powder makes you cringe , but honestly it is not that bad , not even near as bad as a common sore throat .
You do n’t really taste the cayenne at all and the only part that burns a little is when you spit it out the tip of your tongue burns a little bit and if you get it on your lips it will also burn a little , but nothing unbearable at all and nothing that wo n’t go away with a quick rinse of fresh water ( note do n’t gargle the fresh water as you want the cayenne to stay on your throat and work its magic . )
My Recipe
I do n’t think there is really a science to this thing as if you read around there are tons of different recipes and all seem to have very good results .
So here is what I did to make my cayenne sore throat elixir .
1 standard drinking glass of hot to warm water
1 teaspoon of cayenne powder
a couple pinches of salt for good measure ( most people say its not necessary but it wo n’t hurt )
That ’s it !
Just simply take a mouthful and gargle away .
There are two things that I want to point out though .
One you will need to constantly stir the elixir right before you gargle as the cayenne likes to settle at the bottom and two you may want to gargle with your eyes closed as maybe I ’m just a bad gargler , but one time I did gargle some of the mixture into my eye ( note : cayenne pepper in the eye burns )
My Results
Like I said I was to the point where I could not swallow anymore .
Within minutes of gargling the cayenne powder and water I could feel a marked improvement .
I kept gargling my glass of water and cayenne powder on and off for about 45 minutes and my sore throat kept dissipating and dissipating .
When I woke up this morning I noticed two things .
One my sore throat was essentially gone and two my sinuses and throat were completely free of any kind of gunk you get when you are sick .
I feel so clear and so good I just had to let others in on this little miracle .
Certainly this remedy should not take the place of seeing your doctor if your conditions do not get any better , but for about 10 cents of cayenne powder it ’s worth a try to see if you can save a costly trip to the doctor .
I ca n’t think of a cheaper remedy to a common ailment that has such excellent results .
In fact the next time I get a head cold I am going to try some cayenne gargling because it really does clear everything out and the process is not nearly as bad as it sounds .
I honestly feel amazing today compared with how I felt last night and the 3 days before that .
Other options from Earth Clinic
Hot Apple Cider Vinegar & Cayenne Pepper
I did not try this one , but it seems to have similar success .
This one you actually drink rather than gargle and again people feel great .
The recipe is found on the same page as the cayenne gargling .
Again all of the credit goes to the wonderful people at Earth Clinic for posting this cure and commenting on the results .
Cayenne Pepper –

WASHINGTON , Oct. 23 ( UPI ) --
The CIA leak inquiry that threatens senior White House aides has now widened to include the forgery of documents on African uranium that started the investigation , according to NAT0 intelligence sources .
This suggests the inquiry by special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald into the leaking of the identity of undercover CIA officer Valerie Plame has now widened to embrace part of the broader question about the way the Iraq war was justified by the Bush administration .
Advertisement
Fitzgerald 's inquiry is expected to conclude this week and despite feverish speculation in Washington , there have been no leaks about his decision whether to issue indictments and against whom and on what charges .
Two facts are , however , now known and between them they do not bode well for the deputy chief of staff at the White House , Karl Rove , President George W Bush 's senior political aide , not for Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
The first is that Fitzgerald last year sought and obtained from the Justice Department permission to widen his investigation from the leak itself to the possibility of cover-ups , perjury and obstruction of justice by witnesses .
This has renewed the old saying from the days of the Watergate scandal , that the cover - up can be more legally and politically dangerous than the crime .
The second is that NATO sources have confirmed to United Press International that Fitzgerald 's team of investigators has sought and obtained documentation on the forgeries from the Italian government .
Advertisement
Fitzgerald 's team has been given the full , and as yet unpublished report of the Italian parliamentary inquiry into the affair , which started when an Italian journalist obtained documents that appeared to show officials of the government of Niger helping to supply the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein with Yellowcake uranium .
This claim , which made its way into President Bush 's State of the Union address in January , 2003 , was based on falsified documents from Niger and was later withdrawn by the White House .
This opens the door to what has always been the most serious implication of the CIA leak case , that the Bush administration could face a brutally damaging and public inquiry into the case for war against Iraq being false or artificially exaggerated .
This was the same charge that imperiled the government of Bush 's closest ally , British Prime Minister Tony Blair , after a BBC Radio program claimed Blair 's aides has " sexed up " the evidence on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
There can be few more serious charges against a government than going to war on false pretences , or having deliberately inflated or suppressed the evidence that justified the war .
And since no WMD were found in Iraq after the 2003 war , despite the evidence from the U.N. inspections of the 1990s that demonstrated that Saddam Hussein had initiated both a nuclear and a biological weapons program , the strongest plank in the Bush administration 's case for war has crumbled beneath its feet .
The reply of both the Bush and Blair administrations was that they made their assertions about Iraq 's WMD in good faith , and that other intelligence agencies like the French and German were equally mistaken in their belief that Iraq retained chemical weapons , along with the ambition and some of technological basis to restart the nuclear and biological programs .

It is this central issue of good faith that the CIA leak affair brings into question .
The initial claims Iraq was seeking raw uranium in the west African state of Niger aroused the interest of vice - president Cheney , who asked for more investigation .
At a meeting of CIA and other officials , a CIA officer working under cover in the office that dealt with nuclear proliferation , Valerie Plame , suggested her husband , James Wilson , a former ambassador to several African states , enjoyed good contacts in Niger and could make a preliminary inquiry .
He did so , and returned concluding that the claims were untrue .
In July 2003 , he wrote an article for The New York Times making his mission -- and his disbelief -- public .
But by then Elisabetta Burba , a journalist for the Italian magazine Panorama ( owned by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ) had been contacted by a " security consultant " named Rocco Martoni , offering to sell documents that " proved " Iraq was obtaining uranium in Niger for $ 10,000 .
Rather than pay the money , Burba 's editor passed photocopies of the documents to the U.S. Embassy , which forwarded them to Washington , where the forgery was later detected .
Signatures were false , and the government ministers and officials who had signed them were no longer in office on the dates on which the documents were supposedly written .
Nonetheless , the forged documents appeared , on the face of it , to shore up the case for war , and to discredit Wilson .
The origin of the forgeries is therefore of real importance , and any link between the forgeries and Bush administration aides would be highly damaging and almost certainly criminal .

The letterheads and official seals that appeared to authenticate the documents apparently came from a burglary at the Niger Embassy in Rome in 2001 .
At this point , the facts start dribbling away into conspiracy theories that involve membership of shadowy Masonic lodges , Iranian go - betweens , right - wing cabals inside Italian Intelligence and so on .
It is not yet known how far Fitzgerald , in his two years of inquiries , has fished in these murky waters .
There is one line of inquiry with an American connection that Fitzgerald would have found it difficult to ignore .
This is the claim that a mid-ranking Pentagon official , Larry Franklin , held talks with some Italian intelligence and defense officials in Rome in late 2001 .
Franklin has since been arrested on charges of passing classified information to staff of the pro-Israel lobby group , the American - Israel Public Affairs Committee .
Franklin has reportedly reached a plea bargain with his prosecutor , Paul McNulty , and it would be odd if McNulty and Fitzgerald had not conferred to see if their inquiries connected .
Where all this leads will not be clear until Fitzgerald breaks his silence , widely expected to occur this week when the term of his grand jury expires .
If Fitzgerald issues indictments , then the hounds that are currently baying across the blogosphere will leap into the mainstream media and whole affair , Iranian go - betweens and Rome burglaries included , will come into the mainstream of the mass media and network news where Mr. and Mrs. America can see it .
If Fitzgerald issues no indictments , the matter will not simply die away , in part because the press is now hotly engaged , after the new embarrassment of the Times over the imprisonment of the paper 's Judith Miller .
There is also an uncomfortable sense that the press had given the Bush administration too easy a ride after 9/11 .
And the Bush team is now on the ropes and its internal discipline breaking down , making it an easier target .

Then there is a separate Senate Select Intelligence Committee inquiry under way , and while the Republican chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas seems to be dragging his feet , the ranking Democrat , Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia , is now under growing Democratic Party pressure to pursue this question of falsifying the case for war .
And last week , Congressman Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , introduced a resolution to require the president and secretary of state to furnish to Congress documents relating to the so - called White House Iraq Group .
Chief of staff Andrew Card formed the WHIG task force in August 2002 -- seven months before the invasion of Iraq , and Kucinich claims they were charged " with the mission of marketing a war in Iraq . "
The group included : Rove , Libby , Condoleezza Rice , Karen Hughes , Mary Matalin and Stephen Hadley ( now Bush 's national security adviser ) and produced white papers that put into dramatic form the intelligence on Iraq 's supposed nuclear threat .
WHIG launched its media blitz in September 2002 , six months before the war .
Rice memorably spoke of the prospect of " a mushroom cloud , " and Card revealingly explained why he chose September , saying " From a marketing point of view , you do n't introduce new products in August . "
The marketing is over but the war goes on .
The press is baying and the law closes in .
The team of Bush loyalists in the White House is demoralized and braced for disaster .

Basic Spin Manual
Spin は並行システム（中でもデータ通信プロトコル）の論理的一貫性を検証するツールです。システムの振る舞いは、
Promela （ Process Meta Language）と呼ばれるモデリング言語によって記述します。この言語では、並行プロセスの動的生成を記述する事ができます。チャネルを介したメッセージ通信は同期通信（ランデブ）、非同期通信（キューによるバッファリング）の両方を記述する事ができます。
われわれは、 Spin を使い Promela で記述したシステムをランダムシミュレーションしたり、また、
Promela で記述したモデルか ら C 言語の検証プログラムを生成し、システムの正当性の検証を行う事ができます。シミューレーションや検証の間、
Spin はデッドロックがない事や意図しないメッセージを受け取らない事、また実行していないコードがないか、などチェックします。検証プログラムはまたシステムの不変条件が保持されているかどうかを検証したり、ノンプログレスサイクル（non-progress execution cycles）がないか検索したり、線形時相論理（Linear Temporal Logic）で記述した制約に違反していないかを検証します。
検証プログラムは効率性にすぐれ、メモリ使用量も多くありません。
Spin による全探索検証の結果、われわれは、システムの振る舞いにエラーがないかどうかについて、数学的に裏付けされた確証を得ることができるのです。コンピュータのリソースの制限から通常は不可能とされる大きなシステムの検証も、" ビット状態空間手法 "
という倹約技術がその検証を可能としています。この手法では、副作用を最小限に抑えながら、到達可能な各状態を数ビットに圧縮することができます。
このメモの第 1 部では Promela の紹介を、第 2 部では Spin の使用方法についてとりあげます。 Promela の簡潔なリファレンスはこちらにあります。付録では、いくつかの例を示し、
Spin で検証するために Promela を使った基礎的なモデルの作成方法について説明します。
このマニュアルでは、 Spin の主要部分のみについて議論します。 Promela 言語の拡張やツールの最近のバージョンに関する話題については触れていません（詳しくは、このマニュアルの最後を参照してください）。また、LTL で記述した制約を使用した検証についても議論しません。
Promela は検証用のモデリング言語です。この言語では、検証する上で関心のないプロセス間相互作用を捨象し抽象化したプロトコル（または、一般的な分散システム）を記述することができます。
Spin の使用目的は、いくつかの理由により疑わしいと思われる少数のプロセスの振る舞いを検証することです。
Promela で関心のある振る舞い部分について記述し、検証します。
Promela モデルを段階的に詳細化していき、一連のステップを経て検証を完結させます。各々のモデルに対し、環境によって異なる様々な仮定（たとえば、メッセージをロスするとか、メッセージが重複するとか）を設定して、検証することができます。一度、
Spin により正しいモデルを構築することができれば、その後のモデルの作成と検証は、その事実をもとに進めることができます。
Promela モデルはプロセス、メッセージチャネル、変数からなります。プロセスはグローバルオブジェクトです。メッセージチャネルと変数はグローバル、もしくは、プロセス内ローカルに宣言して利用することができます。プロセスは振る舞いを記述し、チャネルとグローバル変数はプロセスが走る環境を定義します。
実行可能性 （Executability ）
Promela には、条件と文の間になにも違いはありません。単独のブール条件は単に文として扱われます。各文の実行は、その実行可能性によります。文は実行可能であるか、実行不可能でブロックされるかのどちらになります。実行可能性は、同期をとる基本的な方法です。ブロックされたプロセスは、実行可能になるイベントが発生するのを待ちます。たとえば、以下のようにビジーループで書く代わりに
while ( a != b ) skip /* wait for a==b */
Promela では下のように書いて、同じ効果を得ることができます。
( a == b )
条件は、その条件が満たされるときのみ実行可能になります。もし、条件が満たされないときは、その条件が満たされるまでブロックされます。
グローバル変数はシステムに関するグローバルな情報を保持し、プロセス内のローカル変数は各プロセスの状態を保持します。変数の宣言は、
bool flag ; int state ; byte msg ;
のように記述します。この例のように Promela は値域の異なる3つの整数型をサポートしています。変数のスコープは、プロセスの宣言の外側で宣言されたものはすべてグローバルになり、プロセス内で宣言したものはプロセス内ローカルになります。
データ型 （Data Types）
下記の表は、32-bit ワードサイズのコンピュータにおける基本データ型、そのサイズ、範囲をまとめたものです（データ型参照）。
Table 1 - Data Types
Typename
bit or bool
byte
short
int
C-equivalent
bit - field
uchar
short
int
Macro in limits .
h
-
CHAR_BIT ( width in bits )
SHRT_MIN..SHRT_MAX
INT_MIN..INT_MAX
Typical Range
0..1
0..255
- 2^15 - 1 .. 2^15 - 1
- 2^31 - 1 .. 2^31 - 1
bit と bool は 1 ビットの情報を表す同義語です。 byte は 0 から 255 までの値をとる符号なしの整数です。 shot と int はそれらがとりうる値の範囲が違うだけで、ともに符号付き整数です。
mtype は、 mtype = { ... } という形で宣言される列挙型です。これについては、後述します。
配列 （Array Variables ）
変数は、配列としても宣言できます。たとえば、
byte state [ N ]
と宣言した場合、state は N 個の byte 型の変数をもつことができる配列です。配列の各要素への代入および値の参照は、
state [ 0 ] = state [ 3 ] + 5 * state [ 3*2/n ]
のように記述し、インデックスには変数や定数を使用する事ができます。配列のインデックスはユニークな整数値を表す式を使用することができます。配列の範囲（0 .. N-1）外のインデックスを指定した場合、その値は未定義です。たいていはランタイムエラーとなります（多次元配列も
typedef を使用する事により間接的に宣言できます。WhatsNew.html 2.1.7 節参照）。
変数宣言と 2 つのタイプの文、ブール条件文と代入文の例を見てきました。宣言と代入は常に実行可能です。また、条件文はそれが満たされているときのみ実行可能です。
プロセス型 （Process Types）
変数やチャネルの状態の参照や変更ができるのは、プロセスのみです。プロセスの振る舞いは proctype 宣言により定義します。たとえば、1 つのローカル変数 state をもつプロセスの宣言の例を下記に示します 。
proctype A ( ) { byte state ; state = 3 }
この場合、プロセス型の名前は A となります。宣言の本体は中括弧 {} で囲みます。宣言の本体 は
、0個以上のローカル変数の宣言、および、文のリストからなります。上記の宣言は、1 つのローカル変数宣言と変数 state に値 3 を代入するひとつの文からなります 。
文は、セミコロンにより分けられます（セミコロンは文の終了記号ではありません。そのため、最後の文のうしろのセミコロンは意味を持ちません）。
Promela は 2 つの異なる文の分離記号（矢印記号 '->' とセミコロン ' ;' ）を持ちます。2 つの違いはありません。矢印記号はときどき 2 つの文の因果関係を表すのに使われます。たとえば、以下の例のように使われます。
byte state = 2 ; proctype A ( ) { ( state == 1 ) -> state = 3 } proctype B ( ) { state = state - 1 }
この例では 、2 つのプロセス 型 A と B を宣言しています。変数 state はグローバル変数として宣言され、値 2 により初期化されます。プロセス 型
A は矢印記号により分けられた 2 つの文からなります。この例では、プロセス 型
B は変数 state の値を 1 減らすひとつの文からなります。代入文は常に実行可能なので、
B 型のプロセスはブロックされる事なく常にその動作を完了させる事ができます。一方
A 型のプロセスは変数 state の値が適切な値をとるまで条件文のところでブロックされます。
プロセスのインスタンス生成 （Process Instantiation ）
proctype による定義はプロセスの振る舞いを宣言するのみで、実行はしません。
Promela モデルでははじめ、タイプ init のひとつのプロセスのみが実行されます。このプロセス型はすべての
Promela モデルの中で明示的に宣言する必要があります* 1 。 Promela で定義できる最も小さいモデルは、以下のものです。
init { skip }
skip は何もしないダミーの文です。しかし興味深い事に、この初期プロセスはグローバル変数を初期化し、プロセスのインスタンスを生成することができます。上記のシステム用の init プロセスの宣言は以下のようになります 。
init { run A ( ) ; run B ( ) }
run はプロセスの名前（例えば 、
A ）を引数にとる単項演算子です。 run は、そのプロセス型が定義されていてインスタンスが生成できるときのみ実行可能です。たとえばすでにたくさんのプロセスが走っていて新たなインスタンスを生成できないときは、実行不可能となります。
run は、生成するプロセスに対し基本データ型のパラメータを渡す事ができます。たとえば、以下のように宣言を記述する事ができます。
proctype A( byte state ; short foo ) { ( state == 1 ) -> state = foo } init { run A ( 1 , 3 ) }
データの配列やプロセス型をパラメータとして渡す事はできません。後で見るように、基本データ型以外にパラメータとして渡せるのは、唯一メッセージチャネルのみです。
新たなプロセスを生成する run は init プロセスだけでなくすべてのプロセスで使用可能です。プロセスは、 run により生成されます。プロセスは、終了したときに（すなわち、プロセス型の宣言の本体部分の最後まで到達すると）姿を消します。プロセスは自身が生成したプロセスが終了してから終了します。
run によりプロセス 型 A と B のコピーをいくつでも作る事ができます。しかしひとつ以上の並行プロセスがひとつのグローバル変数を読み書きする場合、よく知られる問題を引き起こしかねません（[ 2 ]
に例があります）。たとえば、以下のような 2 つのプロセスがグローバル変数 state を共有するシステムを考えましょう。
byte state = 1 ; proctype A ( ) { byte tmp ; ( state==1 ) -> tmp = state ; tmp = tmp+1 ; state = tmp } proctype B ( ) { byte tmp ; ( state==1 ) -> tmp = state ; tmp = tmp - 1 ; state = tmp } init { run A ( ) ; run B ( ) }
もし 2 つのうちひとつのプロセスが相手のプロセスがスタートする前に完了してしまうと、もう一方のプロセスははじめの条件文のところで永遠にブロックされてしまいます。もし
2 つのプロセスが同時に条件文を通り抜けたら、2 つとも完了する事ができるでしょう。しかしそのときの state の値は予測不可能です。 state の値は 0 , 1 , 2 のうちのどれかになるでしょう 。
この問題にはたくさんの解が考えられます。グローバル変数を使わないというような方法から、共有変数のテストとセットを不可分で行う事を保証する特別なマシン語を利用する方法まで。下記の例は最初に公開された解のひとつです。これはドイツの数学者
Dekker によるものです。このアルゴリズムにより、3 つのグローバル変数を使い、コード中の任意のクリティカルセクションへの進入を
2 つのプロセスが排他的に行うことができます。 Promela モデルの最初の 4 行は、C 言語スタイルのマクロ定義です。最初の 2 つのマクロは true を定数 1 、 false を定数 0 に定義しています。同様に 、Aturn , Bturn も定数として定義しています 。
# define true 1 # define false 0 # define Aturn false # define Bturn true bool x , y , t ; proctype A ( ) { x = true ; t = Bturn ; ( y == false || t == Aturn ) ; /* critical section */ x = false } proctype B ( ) { y = true ; t = Aturn ; ( x == false || t == Bturn ) ; /* critical section */ y = false } init { run A ( ) ; run B ( ) }
このアルゴリズムは、繰り返し実行する事ができ、2つのプロセスの実行スピードにはまったく依存していません。
atomic シーケンス （Atomic Sequences ）
Promela にはこのテスト & セットの問題を回避する別の手段があります。それは、 atomic です。キーワード atomic で囲まれる文のシーケンスは、他のプロセスによってインターリーブされず、不可分に実行されます。 atomic シーケンスの中の最初の文以外のところでブロックされた場合、ランタイムエラーとなります*2。このように atomic シーケンスを使う事により、先の例に示したグローバル変数 state に対する並行アクセスに関する問題を防ぐことができます。
byte state = 1 ; proctype A ( ) { atomic { ( state==1 ) -> state = state +1 } } proctype B( ) { atomic { ( state==1 ) -> state = state - 1 } } init { run A ( ) ; run B ( ) }
このケースでは state の最後の値は、どちらのプロセスが実行したかにより 0 または 2 になります。もう一方のプロセスは永遠にブロックされます。
atomic シーケンスは検証するモデルの複雑さを軽減する重要な道具です。 atomic シーケンスは分散システムがとりうるインターリービングを制限することに注意してください。例えば、ローカル変数に対する操作を atomic シーケンスとすることによって、複雑なモデルを扱う事ができるようになります。これにより複雑さを劇的に減少させる事ができます。
メッセージ通信 （Message Passing ）
メッセージチャネルはひとつのプロセスから他のプロセスへのデータ転送をモデル化するのに使用されます。以下で示すように、チャネルはローカル変数でもグローバル変数でも宣言できます。
chan qname = [ 16 ] of { short }
上記は short 型のメッセージを 16 個保持する事ができるチャネルを宣言しています。チャネルの名前はチャネルを通して他のプロセスへ送ったり、プロセスのインスタンス生成時のパラメータとして渡したりすることができます。もしそのチャネルでやり取りされるメッセージがひとつ以上のフィールドを持つ場合の宣言は以下のようになります。
chan qname = [ 16 ] of { byte , int , chan , byte }
このときこのチャネルは、それぞれ 2 つの 8 bitの値、1 つの 32 bitの値、チャネルの名前をもつメッセージを 16 個保持することができます。
次の文、
は、式 expr の値を上記の例で作ったチャネル qname へ送信します。チャネルの（キューの）末尾にその値を追加します。
上の文は、チャネルの先頭からメッセージを受信し、変数 msg に代入します。チャネルは first - in - first - out 順でメッセージをやりとりします。上記のケースではひとつの値がチャネルを通してやりとりされてます。もしメッセージごとに
2 つ以上の値をやりとりしたい場合は、下記のようにコンマで区切ったリストをチャネルに続き記述します。
qname!expr1, expr2,expr3 qname?var1, var2,var3
チャネルの宣言よりもメッセージの送受信のパラメータが多かったり、少なかったりした場合はエラーとなります。
便宜のため、メッセージの最初のフィールドはよくメッセージタイプを表すために使われます（つまり、定数が使われる事が多いのです）。このような場合の別の書き方として、送受信操作のパラメータを、メッセージタイプに続き括弧でくくってメッセージフィールドのリストを続けることがあります。
qname!expr1( expr2,expr3 ) qname?var1 ( var2, var3 )
メッセージの送信操作は、チャネルがいっぱいでないとき実行可能となります。また受信操作は受信しようとしているチャネルが空でないとき実行可能となります。また、受信時のパラメータのいくつかを定数とする事もできます。
qname?cons1,var2,cons2
この場合、定数で指定したすべてのメッセージフィールドの値がチャネルの先頭のメッセージと一致する場合、受信操作は実行可能となります。繰り返しになりますが、実行不可能であったとしてもなにも悪い事はおきません。プロセスはその文が実行可能になるまでブロックされるか、他の実行可能な文を実行します。
ここにいままで紹介したいくつかの機構を使った例を示しましょう。
proctype A( chan q1 ) { chan q2 ; q1?q2 ; q2!123 } proctype B( chan qforb ) { int x ; qforb?x ; printf ( " x = %d
" , x ) } init { chan qname = [ 1 ] of { chan } ; chan qforb = [ 1 ] of { int } ; run A ( qname ) ; run B ( qforb ) ; qname ! qforb }
プリントされる値は 、123 となります。
定義済みの関数 len( qname ) はパラメータで渡した名前をもつチャネルに現在保存されているメッセージの数を返します。もし代入文の右辺ではなく単にひとつの文として使われた場合、チャネルが空の場合は実行不可能になる事に注意してください。なぜなら、空の場合は
0 を返し、定義によりそれは一時的に実行不可能となるからです。また、
( qname ?var == 0 ) /* syntax error */
または
( a > b && qname !
123 ) /* syntax error */
のように、 Promela では条件文と送受信操作を組み合わせることはできません（このような条件文は副作用なしには評価できない事に注意してください）。上記のような受信文の代わりに、?
のうしろに [ ] を使うことができます。
この文は、条件文として評価されます。もし以下の文が実行可能だったら（ qname チャネルの先頭に ack メッセージがあったら） 、1 を返します。そうでなければ、0 を返します 。
以下の文は、受信できるかどうか評価されますが、決して受信しない、副作用のない文です。
qname ?[ ack , var ]
以下のような non-atomic なシーケンスに注意してください 。
( len ( qname ) < MAX ) -> qname !
msgtype
または
qname ?[ msgtype ] -> qname ?
msgtype
これらの文は、2 つ目の文がひとつ目の文のあとに必ず実行されるとは限りません。複数のプロセス間で共有するチャネルにアクセスする場合はレースコンディションが存在するかもしれません。最初のケースでは、このプロセスがチャネルがいっぱいではないと決定した直後に他のプロセスがこのチャネルへメッセージを送信する事ができます。また、2 番目のケースは、われわれのプロセスがメッセージの存在を確認した直後に、他のプロセスがそのメッセージを奪い取ることができます。
ランデブ通信 （Rendez - Vous Communication ）
ここまではメッセージチャネルを介した非同期通信について見てきました。ここで
N を正の整数とすると、バッファサイズ N のチャネルを以下のように宣言してきました。
chan qname = [ N ] of { byte }
このとき、論理的には以下のような宣言も認められます。
chan port = [ 0 ] of { byte }
これは、byte メッセージひとつをやりとりするランデブポートを定義しています。チャネルのサイズが
0 であるということは、この ポート はメッセージを保持しておく事はできません。このようなランデブポートを介してのメッセージのやり取りは同期になります。つぎのような例を考えてみましょう。
# define msgtype 33 chan name = [ 0 ] of { byte , byte } ; proctype A ( ) { name!msgtype( 124 ) ; name!msgtype( 121 ) } proctype B ( ) { byte state ; name? msgtype(state ) } init { atomic { run A ( ) ; run B ( ) } }
チャネル name はグローバルなランデブポートとして宣言されています。2 つのプロセスは最初の文を同期して実行します。 msgtype によるハンドシェイクによ り 、124 が B のローカル変数 state へ転送されます 。 A の 2 番目の文は実行できません、なぜならプロセス B にそれに対応する受信操作がないからです 。
もしチャネル name が 0 ではないバッファサイズで宣言されていると、振る舞いは異なります。バッファサイズが少なくとも 2 あれば、プロセス B がスタートする前であったとしてもプロセ ス
A は実行を完了する事ができたでしょう。バッファサイズが 1 の場合は、次のようなシーケンスとなるでしょう。プロセス
A が最初の送信操作を行った後 、2 番目の送信操作でチャネルがフルのためブロックされます。続いて、プロセス
B が最初のメッセージを受信します。この時点でプロセ ス
A は再び実行可能となり、どのプロセスも受信しない余分なメッセージを送信します。
ランデブ通信は、2 者間で行われます。ランデブ通信により同期がとれるのは、送信プロセスと受信プロセスの 2 つのプロセスだけです。後半ではセマフォの構築するためにこのランデブ通信を利用する例を見ます。しかしその前に、役に立ちそうないくつかの制御構造について紹介したいと思います。
前節までに、文の連結、プロセスの並行実行、アトミックシーケンスの
3 つの制御構造を見てきました。ここでは、さらに
Promela でとりあげるべき 3 つの制御構造について紹介します。選択、反復、無条件ジャンプの 3 つです。
選択 （Case Selection ）
最も単純な構造は選択構造です。たとえば、2 つの変数 a と b の関係を使って 2 つのオプションを書く事ができます 。
if :: ( a != b ) -> option1 :: ( a == b ) -> option2 fi
選択構造は 2 つの実行シーケンスからなります。それぞれの頭にはコロン 2 つをおきます。リストの中から実行されるシーケンスはひとつだけです。最初の文が実行可能なもののうちひとつが実行されます。最初の文はガードと呼ばれます。
上記の例では、ガードは排他的になっていますが、必ずしもそうでなければならいというわけではありません。もしひとつ以上のガードが実行可能な場合、実行可能なもののうちどのシーケンスが実行されるかは非決定的です。もしすべてのガードが実行不可能だった場合、プロセスはすくなくともひとつのガードが選択できるようになるまでブロックされます。ガードとして使用できる文の種類に制限はありません。以下に示すように、メッセージの受信操作も書く事ができます。
# define a 1 # define b 2 chan ch = [ 1 ] of { byte } ; proctype A ( ) { ch!a } proctype B ( ) { ch!b } proctype C ( ) { if :: ch?a :: ch?b fi } init { atomic { run A ( ) ; run B ( ) ; run C ( ) } }
この例では 3 つのプロセスとひとつのチャネルを定義しています。プロセス
C の選択構造の最初のオプションはチャネルにメッセージ a （ここでは a はマクロで定義されているように定 数
1）が含まれるとき実行可能になります 。2 番目のオプションはメッセージ b （ a と同様にこれも定数）が含まれるとき実行可能になります。プロセスの実行スピードに関して特に何も規定していないため、どちらのメッセージが最初に届くかは分かりません。
以下のプロセスは変数 count を一度だけ +1 するか、 - 1 します。
byte count ; proctype counter ( ) { if :: count = count + 1 :: count = count - 1 fi }
反復 （Repetition ）
選択構造の論理的延長線上に反復構造があります。上記の例で示したプログラムに手を加えて、変数の値を繰り返しランダムにアップダウンさせるプログラムを得ることができます。
byte count ; proctype counter ( ) { do :: count = count + 1 :: count = count - 1 :: ( count == 0 ) -> break od }
実行のたびにひとつのオプションが選ばれます。そのオプションを実行し終わると、その構造を繰り返し実行します。反復構造を終了するには通常 break 文を使用します。この例では、その変数 count の値が 0 のときにループから抜ける事ができます。 count が 0 のときに必ずしも break を実行するわけではないということに注意してください。他の 2 つのオプションは常に実行可能なので、 count が 0 になったからといって必ずしも break されるわけではないのです。 count が 0 になったときに必ず break するようにするには、以下のようにプログラムを変更する必要があります。
proctype counter ( ) { do :: ( count != 0 ) -> if :: count = count + 1 :: count = count - 1 fi :: ( count == 0 ) -> break od }
無条件ジャンプ （Unconditional Jumps ）
ループから抜けるもう一つの方法は、無条件ジャンプ、悪名高い goto 文、を使用する方法です。以下の例は、0 ではない 2 つの正の整数の最大公約数を見つけるユークリッドのアルゴリズムを実装したものです。
proctype Euclid( int x , y ) { do :: ( x > y ) -> x = x - y :: ( x < y ) -> y = y - x :: ( x == y ) -> goto done od ; done : skip }
この例の goto ではラベル done へジャンプします。ラベルは文の前におく必要があります。上記ではプログラムの最後にジャンプさせたいのですが、こういったケースではダミー文の skip が役に立ちます。 skip はいつでも実行可能な何も作用を及ぼさない文です。また goto は常に実行可能です 。
以下の例ではチャネル in に入ってくるメッセージをその大きさによりそれぞれ large チャネルと small チャネルに分配するフィルタを定義しています。マクロにより定数
N は 128 に、 size は 16 に定義されています 。
# define N 128 # define size 16 chan in = [ size ] of { short } ; chan large = [ size ] of { short } ; chan small = [ size ] of { short } ; proctype split ( ) { short cargo ; do :: in ? cargo -> if :: ( cargo >= N ) -> large !cargo :: ( cargo < N ) -> small ! cargo fi od } init { run split ( ) }
以下に示すプロセス型 merge は、2つのストリームを再びひとつにまとめます。しかし、順番はもとのものは異なることになるでしょう。
proctype merge ( ) { short cargo ; do :: if :: large ?
cargo :: small ?
cargo fi ; in ! cargo od }
もし init プロセスを以下のようにしたら、 split と merge プロセスは永遠に走り続けるでしょう 。
init { in !345 ; in ! 12 ; in ! 6777 ; in ! 32 ; in!0 ; run split ( ) ; run merge ( ) }
最後の例は、ランデブ通信を使ってダイクストラのセマフォを実装したものです。
# define p 0 # define v 1 chan sema = [ 0 ] of { bit } ; proctype dijkstra ( ) { byte count = 1 ; do :: ( count == 1 ) -> sema !p ; count = 0 :: ( count == 0 ) -> sema ?v ; count = 1 od } proctype user ( ) { do :: sema ?p ; /* critical section */ sema !v ; /* non-critical section */ od } init { run dijkstra( ) ; run user ( ) ; run user ( ) ; run user ( ) }
セマフォはクリティカルセクションに 2 つ以上のプロセスが同時にいないことを保障してくれます。しかし、ひとつのプロセスがクリティカルセクションを独占的にアクセスすることを回避してくれるわけではありません。
手続きのモデルリングと再帰 （Modeling Procedures and Recursion）
手続きは、たとえ再帰的でも、プロセスによってモデル化可能です。返り値はグローバル変数か、メッセージによって呼び出しプロセスへ返されます。以下のプログラムはそれを示したものです。
proctype fact ( int n ; chan p ) { chan child = [ 1 ] of { int } ; int result ; if :: ( n <= 1 ) -> p!1 :: ( n >= 2 ) -> run fact ( n - 1 , child ) ; child ?
result ; p!n*result fi } init { chan child = [ 1 ] of { int } ; int result ; run fact ( 7 , child ) ; child ?
result ; printf ( " result : %d
" , result ) }
プロセス fact ( n , p ) は、n の階乗を再帰的に計算し、親プロセス p へメッセージにより結果を返します 。
タイムアウト （Timeouts ）
前節までに Promela での定義済みの文を 2 つ、 skip と break について紹介しました。もうひとつの定義済みの文は timeout です。 timeout は、空のチャネルからメッセージを待つような、決して真にはならない条件を待つのを中断するためにつくられた、特別な条件をモデル化したものです。 timeout キーワードは、システムがハングした状態からの脱出を
Promela でモデル化するためのものです。 timeout 条件は、分散システム内の他のすべての文が実行不可能になったときに真になります。絶対的なタイミングを考慮にいれていないことに注意してください。これは検証作業において極めて重要なことです。また、われわれは timeout がどのように実装されるべきかについては明示していません。以下に、システムが行き詰まったときにはいつでも guard チャネルに reset メッセージを送信するプロセスの例を示します 。
proctype watchdog ( ) { do :: timeout -> guard ! reset od }
表明 （Assertions ）
Promela で多少説明が必要な重要なもうひとつの言語構成要素は assert 文です。この文は以下の形式をとります 。
assert ( any_boolean_condition )
assert はいつでも実行可能です。もし条件が満たされたならば、この文はなにも作用を及ぼしません。しかし、もし条件が満たされなかったら、この文はエラーを報告するでしょう。
このモデリング言語は検証面に特化したいつくかの特徴を持ちます。そのような特徴は、これから話題にあげるラベルの使い方や、
Promela における timeout 文の意味や、 assert のような文の使い方に見られます 。
終了状態ラベル （End-State Labels ）
検証言語として Promela を使用する場合は、モデル化した振る舞いについて非常に特殊な表明ができるようにしなければなりません。特に
Promela によってデッドロックの存在をチェックする場合は、検証プログラムは、ユーザが望んでいないデッドロックと通常の終了状態を見分けられるようにしなければなりません。
Promela では、インスタンス化されたすべてのプロセスが定義されているプログラム本体の最後まで到達し、かつ、すべてのメッセージチャネルが空である状態を、通常の終了状態と見なします。しかし、すべてのプロセスがプログラム本体の最後まで到達するようにモデル化されるとは限りません。例えば、いくつかのプロセスは
IDLE 状態に居続けるかもしれませんし、また、あるプロセスは新しいメッセージの受信をループの先頭で待ち続けるかもしれません。
そこで、検証プログラムがこのような終了状態とデッドロックを明確に見分けるために、
Promela では終了状態ラベルを使う事ができます。たとえば、前述のプロセス型 dijkstra( ) にラベルをひとつ追加します*3 。
proctype dijkstra( ) { byte count = 1 ; end : do :: ( count == 1 ) -> sema !p ; count = 0 :: ( count == 0 ) -> sema ?v ; count = 1 od }
end ラベルを追加することにより、プロセス型 dijkstra ( ) がプロセス定義の最後の括弧まで到達しなくても、ループの先頭にいればエラーとはなりません。もちろん、このような状態はデッドロック状態の一部かもしれませんが、もしデッドロックがまだあるとしたら、それはこのプロセスが原因ではないでしょう（もし他のプロセスが正当な終了状態にいない場合は検証プログラムが報告してくれるでしょう）。
ひとつの検証モデルにつきひとつ以上の終了状態があるかもしれません。もしそのようなときは、プロセス内のラベルの名前はすべてユニークにしなければなりません。また、終了状態ラベルの名前は、かならず end の 3 文字から始める必要があります。 endde , end0 , end_appel のようにラベル付けされた状態は検証プログラムにすべて正当な終了状態として扱われます。
プログレス状態ラベル （Progress - State Labels ）
終了状態ラベルと同じように、ユーザはプログレス状態ラベルを定義する事ができます。この場合、プログレス状態ラベルはプロトコルが進展しなければならない状態にマークすることができます。プロトコルの実行中にこれらプログレス状態ラベルをひとつも通過しないすべての無限サイクルは、潜在的に餓死ループ（starvation loop）になり得ます。たとえば dijkstra の例では、セマフォテストの成功に " progress " というラベルをつけ、検証プログラムは、プロトコルの実行中は必ずセマフォテストを成功するプロセスがあることを確認してくれます。
proctype dijkstra( ) { byte count = 1 ; end : do :: ( count == 1 ) -> progress : sema !p ; count = 0 :: ( count == 0 ) -> sema ?v ; count = 1 od }
もしひとつ以上の状態にプログレスラベルをつける場合は、
progress0 , progress_foo のような progress から始まるユニークな名前のラベルをつける必要があります。
- a フラグを指定し て Spin に生成させた検証プログラムはランタイムオプション -l をサポートします。検証プログラムは、デフォルトではまずデッドロックの探索を行いますが、このフラグを指定した検証プログラムは non-progress ループの探索を行います。この探索はデッドロックの探索に比べ約
2 倍の時間とメモリ使用量を要します（標準の手法に対する大幅な改良は、強連結成分解析を基盤としています）。
メッセージタイプ定義 （Message Type Definitions ）
いままでは、どのように変数を宣言するのか、また、C
スタイルのマクロを使ってどのように定数を定義するのか、を見てきました。
Promela はメッセージタイプの定義のために以下のような定義も認めています。
mtype = { ack , nak , err , next , accept }
この方法は、それぞれのメッセージタイプに実際にどういった値を使用するかということを抽象している点でより好ましいやり方です。定数の名前はそのまま検証プログラムの中で使用する事ができるため、エラーの報告を改善する事ができます。
チャネルの宣言において mtype キーワードを使用する事により、対応するメッセージフィールドを数値としてではなく、記号として扱う事ができます。例えば、以下のように宣言できます。
chan q = [ 4 ] of { mtype , mtype , bit , short } ;
偽文（Pseudo Statements ）
ここまでは、 Promela で定義されるすべての基本文（代入、条件、送信／受信、 assert 、 timeout 、 goto 、 break 、 skip ）を見てきました。そして、文でありませんが chan , len , run といった条件文や代入文で使用する事ができる単項演算子についても見てきました。
skip 文は、実際にはまったく作用を及ぼさない、構文の要求を満たすのにフィルタの役割を果たす文として紹介しました。 skip は形式的には言語の一部ではないのですが、単に 定数 ( 1 ) と書いた単純な条件文と同じ効果をもつ同義語であり、偽文です。同じような偽文に、(0 ) と等価な block や hang 、 assert ( 0 ) と等価な halt が考えられます（実際にはこれらは定義されていません）。 else はもうひとつの偽文です。これは選択や反復の中で最後のオプションシーケンスの文として使用する事ができます。
if :: a > b -> ... :: else -> ... fi
else は同じ選択の中の他のすべてのオプションが実行不可能なときにだけ実行可能になります。
例 （Example ）
Promela でモデル化した単純な（欠陥のある）プロトコルの例を示します。
mtype = { ack , nak , err , next , accept } ; proctype transfer ( chan in , out , chin , chout ) { byte o , i ; in ? next ( o ) ; do :: chin?nak( i ) -> out!accept( i ) ; chout!ack(o ) :: chin?ack( i ) -> out !accept( i ) ; in ? next ( o ) ; chout!ack(o ) :: chin?err( i ) -> chout ! nak(o ) od } init { chan AtoB = [ 1 ] of { mtype , byte } ; chan BtoA = [ 1 ] of { mtype , byte } ; chan Ain = [ 2 ] of { mtype , byte } ; chan Bin = [ 2 ] of { mtype , byte } ; chan Aout = [ 2 ] of { mtype , byte } ; chan Bout = [ 2 ] of { mtype , byte } ; atomic { run transfer ( Ain , Aout , AtoB , BtoA ) ; run transfer ( Bin , Bout , BtoA , AtoB ) } ; AtoB!err ( 0 ) }
チャネル Ain と
Bin は、ここでは定義していないバックグランドプロセス（この転送システムのユーザプロセス）によって、メッセージタイプ next と任意の値
（ASCII の文字コード）のトークンメッセージで埋められます。同様に、ユーザプロセスは、チャネル
Aout , Bout からデータを受信する事ができます。チャネルとプロセスは、アトミックに初期化され、ダミーの err メッセージによりスタートします 。
Promela で記述したシステムのモデルが与えられたとき、
Spin はシステムのランダムシミュレーションをしたり、システムの状態空間を素早く探索する
C 言語の検証プログラムを生成したりすることができます。この検証プログラムは、たとえば、プロトコルを実行中、ユーザが記述したシステムの不変条件を違反していないか、チェックします。
何もオプションを指定しないで Spin を起動した場合は、ランダムシミュレーションを行います。オプション
-n N を指定した場合は、ランダムシミュレーションのための種を整数
N に設定します 。
オプション pglrs は、ユーザがシミュレーションについて出力したい情報のレベルを設定するのに使用します。出力のすべての行は、通常モデルのソースの行番号への参照を含みます。
- p は、すべてのステップに対して Promela プロセスの状態変化を表示します 。
- g は、すべてのステップに対してそのときのグローバル変数の値を表示します。
- l は、ローカル変数をもつプロセスが状態変化したあとのローカル変数の値を表示します。
-p オプションを組み合わせて使うといいでしょう。
-r はすべてのメッセージ受信イベントを表示します。これは受信したプロセスの名前と番号、ソースの行番号、メッセージのパラメータ番号（パラメータごとに
1 行になります）、メッセージタイプとメッセージチャネルの名前と番号を表示します。
-s はすべてのメッセージ送信イベントを表示します。
Spin ではさらに 3 つのオプション（ - a 、 -m 、 -t ）を使用する事ができます 。
- a はプロトコルに特化した検証プログラムを生成します。この出力は pan.[cbhmt ] と名付けられるいくつかの
C 言語のファイルに書き出されます。生成されたファイルをコンパイルする事により実行可能な検証器が生成されます。状態空間をくまなく探索する場合は、単に次のようにコンパイルするだけでいいでしょう。
$ gcc -o pan pan.c
大きなシステムの場合は、コンピュータのメモリを使い尽くすかもしれません。そのような大きなシステムの検証をする場合は、メモリを効率的に使うビット状態空間法を使う事により検証が可能になるかもしれません。ビット状態空間法を使用するときは以下のようにコンパイルします。
$ gcc -DBITSTATE -o pan pan.c
このような探索のカバレージは、ハッシュ要素（詳細は後述）によります。生成された実行可能な検証プログラム自身にもオプションを指定する事ができます。検証プログラムに指定できるオプションは、上記のようにコンパイルした場合は " ./ pan -? "
により確認できます（検証プログラムに指定できるオプションについては、後述の「検証プログラムを使用する」で説明します）。
- m は、メッセージ送信のデフォルトの振る舞いを変更するのに使用します。通常は、送信操作はターゲットとなるチャネルがいっぱいでないときだけ実行可能になります。これは暗黙のうちに同期を引き起こす事がありますが、それはいつでも望まれるものではありません。 -m オプションを指定する事により送信操作は常に実行可能になります。いっぱいになっているチャネルへ送信したメッセージは失われます。このオプションを - a オプションと組み合わせて検証プログラムを生成した場合は、生成される検証プログラムの振る舞いも同様に異なります。検証する際には、メッセージが失われる事も考慮に入れる必要があるでしょう。
-t は、軌跡表示用のオプションです。検証プログラムが assert に対する違反やデッドロックや望まないメッセージの受信を見つけた場合、検証プログラムは pan.trail という名のファイルにエラーの軌跡を書き出します。
Spin に -t オプションを指定する事によりその詳細を見る事ができます。他のオプション（ pglrs ）と組み合わせる事によりエラーシーケンスに対するいろいろな視点を簡単に手に入れる事ができるでしょう。
ここで紹介しなかった Spin の他のオプションについては省略します。詳しくは、[ 5 ]
を見てください。またヒントとして、このマニュアルの最後にある
" さらに深く掘り下げる " も見てください 。
シミュレータ （The Simulator）
以下に示すプロトコルの例を考えてみましょう。ここでは、以下のモデルを lynch というファイルに保存したとします。
1 #define MIN 9 2 # define MAX 12 3 # define FILL 99 4 5 mtype = { ack , nak , err } 6 7 proctype transfer ( chan chin , chout ) 8 { byte o , i , last_i=MIN ; 9 10 o = MIN+1 ; 11 do 12 :: chin?nak( i ) -> 13 assert ( i == last_i+1 ) ; 14 chout!ack(o ) 15 :: chin?ack( i ) -> 16 if 17 :: ( o < MAX ) -> o = o+1 18 :: ( o >= MAX ) -> o = FILL 19 fi ; 20 chout!ack(o ) 21 :: chin?err( i ) -> 22 chout!nak (o ) 23 od 24 } 25 26 proctype channel ( chan in , out ) 27 { byte md , mt ; 28 do 29 :: in ? mt , md -> 30 if 31 :: out !mt , md 32 :: out ! err,0 33 fi 34 od 35 } 36 37 init 38 { chan AtoB = [ 1 ] of { mtype , byte } ; 39 chan BtoC = [ 1 ] of { mtype , byte } ; 40 chan CtoA = [ 1 ] of { mtype , byte } ; 41 atomic { 42 run transfer ( AtoB , BtoC ) ; 43 run channel ( BtoC , CtoA ) ; 44 run transfer ( CtoA , AtoB ) 45 } ; 46 AtoB!err,0 ; /* start */ 47 0 /* hang */ 48 }
このプロトコルはメッセージタイプ ack 、 nak 、 err を使用します。 err は 、2 つの転送プロセス間のチャネル通信におけるメッセージのゆがみをモデル化するのに使用しています。チャネルの振る舞いはチャネルプロセスによりモデル化しています。また転送プロセスの
2 つのローカル変数間の不変条件（上記のものはわざと間違っています）を assert を使って表明しています 。
何もオプションを指定しないで Spin を走らせると、ランダムシミュレーションを行い、実行が終わると単に出力するか、実行中に通った printf 文を出力します。この場合は、以下のような出力になります。
$ spin lynch # no options , not recommended spin : " lynch " line 13 : assertion violated # processes : 4 proc 3 ( transfer ) line 11 ( state 15 ) proc 2 ( channel ) line 28 ( state 6 ) proc 1 ( transfer ) line 13 ( state 3 ) proc 0 ( : init : ) line 48 ( state 6 ) 4 processes created $
上記のモデルには printf はないので printf に対する出力はありませんが、プロセスが assert に違反したため、そのことが出力されています。さらに知りたい場合は、よりたくさん（たとえば、すべての受信イベント）出力するように走らせる事もできます。その結果を下の図
1 に示します。出力についてはほとんど説明するまでもないでしょう。
上記のシミュレーションでは何度行っても同じ assert 違反を検出します。シミュレーションはランダムに非決定的選択をしているので、つねにこのケースの違反を見つける必要はありません。再現可能な実行シーケンスを強制する場合は、
-n N オプションを使います。例えば、
$ spin -r - n100 lynch
とすると、ランダムジェネレータの種に整数
100 を使用し、毎回同じ出力が得られる事を保証します。
別のオプションを指定する事により、シミュレーションの実行による出力を多く出す事ができますが、出力されるテキストはすぐに膨大な量になります。それに対する簡単な解は grep を使って出力をフィルタリングする事です。たとえば、上記の例においてチャネルプロセスの振る舞いしか興味なかったとしてら、以下のようにします。
$ spin - n100 -r lynch | grep " proc 2 "
そうすると、図 1 のような結果になります。
$ spin -r lynch proc 1 ( transfer ) line 21 , Recv err,0 <- queue 1 ( chin ) proc 2 ( channel ) line 29 , Recv nak,10 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 3 ( transfer ) line 12 , Recv nak,10 <- queue 3 ( chin ) proc 1 ( transfer ) line 15 , Recv ack , 10 <- queue 1 ( chin ) ... proc 1 ( transfer ) line 15 , Recv ack , 12 <- queue 1 ( chin ) proc 2 ( channel ) line 29 , Recv ack , 99 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 3 ( transfer ) line 15 , Recv ack , 99 <- queue 3 ( chin ) proc 1 ( transfer ) line 15 , Recv ack , 99 <- queue 1 ( chin ) proc 2 ( channel ) line 29 , Recv ack , 99 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 3 ( transfer ) line 21 , Recv err, 0 <- queue 3 ( chin ) proc 1 ( transfer ) line 12 , Recv nak,99 <- queue 1 ( chin ) spin : " lynch " line 13 : assertion violated # processes : 4 proc 3 ( transfer ) line 11 ( state 15 ) proc 2 ( channel ) line 28 ( state 6 ) proc 1 ( transfer ) line 13 ( state 3 ) proc 0 ( : init : ) line 48 ( state 6 ) 4 processes created $ spin - n100 -r lynch | grep " proc 2 " proc 2 ( channel ) line 29 , Recv nak,10 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 2 ( channel ) line 29 , Recv ack , 11 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 2 ( channel ) line 29 , Recv ack , 12 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 2 ( channel ) line 28 ( state 6 ) 図 1 . シミュレーションの出力
以下のような結果を得るには、 -c オプション（バージョン3.0での新機能）を使います。
$ spin -c lynch proc 0 = : init : proc 1 = transfer proc 2 = channel proc 3 = transfer q\p 0 1 2 3 1 AtoB!err,0 1 . chin?err,0 2 . chout !

最初の列がチャネルの id 番号、最初の行がプロセス id 番号で、各行はどのプロセスがメッセージの転送を行ったかを出力しています。
シミュレーションは新しい設計した結果についてざっとデバッグするには役に立ちますが、そのシステムが本当にエラーを含んでいないかどうかを証明する事はできません。
Spin では -a と -t オプションを使う事により、たとえ非常に大きなモデルであったとしても検証する事ができます。
プロトコルモデルに対する状態空間探索プログラムは以下の 1 行目のようにして作られる 5 つファイルからなります。
$ spin - a lynch $ wc pan .[ bchmt ] 99 285 1893 pan.b 3158 10208 70337 pan.c 356 1238 7786 pan.h 216 903 6045 pan.m 575 2099 14017 pan.t 4404 14733 100078 total
pan.c はプロトコルの検証を行う
C 言語のコードのほとんどを含みます。pan .t はプロトコルの制御フローをエンコードした遷移マトリクスを含みます。pan.b
と pan.m は順方向の遷移と逆方向の遷移の
C のコード、pan.h はヘッダファイルです。これらはいくつかの方法でコンパイルする事ができます（たとえば、全状態空間探索するとか、ビット状態空間を使用するとか）。
全探索 （Exhaustive Search ）
システムの状態空間がおおよそ100,000ほどまでならば、もっとも良い方法は、デフォルトのままプログラムをコンパイルすることです。
$ gcc -o pan pan.c
コンパイルによってできた実行プログラム pan を実行する事により検証する事ができます。この場合の検証は全探索を行います、つまり、可能なすべてのイベントシーケンスをテストします。もちろん、 assert 違反があればそれを見つけ出します。
$ ./ pan assertion violated ( i == last_i + 1 ) ) pan : aborted pan : wrote pan.trail search interrupted vector 64 byte , depth reached 56 61 states , stored 5 states , linked 1 states , matched hash conflicts : 0 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 0/5 )
( より新しいバーションの出力形式は、同じ情報を含んでいますが、もっと洗練されています。)
出力の最初の 1 行目は、 assert 違反があった事を報告し、不変条件が満たされなかった最初の反例を教えてくれます。この違反は
61 状態が生成された後に発見されています。ハッシュ " conflicts " は、状態空間をアクセスしている間におきたハッシュの衝突回数を示しています。全探索モードでは、すべての状態はリスト（linked list）に格納して、すべての衝突を解決しています。この場合における最も関心がある部分は、3 行目でしょう。これは、シミュレータによって再現可能なエラーシーケンスが trail ファイルに作られたことを示しています。そこで以下のようにすると、
$ spin -t -r lynch | grep " proc 2 "
エラーの原因がなにであったか特定する事できるでしょう。 assert が適切であれば、検証プログラムはその違反を見つけてくれます。もしこのような違反が報告されなかった場合は、間違いなく assert 違反を犯すような実行シーケンスがなかったということでしょう。
オプション （Options ）
検証プログラムはいくつかのオプションが指定できるように生成されます。どのようなオプションがあるかは、以下のようにするとチェックできます。
$ ./ pan -- - cN stop at Nth error ( default=1 ) -l find non-progress cycles # when compiled with - DNP - a find acceptance cycles # when not compiled with - DNP - mN max depth N ( default=10 k ) - wN hash table of 2 ^N entries ( default=18 ) ...etc .
最初の -c オプションの引数 に 0 を設定すると、検証プログラムはエラーを見つけても状態空間探索を続けます。エラーが見つからなかった場合や -c0 オプションが指定された場合は、その検証が終了すると、実行できなかった（到達できなかった）コードに関する要旨を示します。この場合の出力は以下のようになります。
$ ./ pan - c0 assertion violated ( i == ( last_i + 1 ) ) vector 64 byte , depth reached 60 , errors : 5 165 states , stored 5 states , linked 26 states , matched hash conflicts : 1 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 0/6 ) unreached code : init : ( proc 0 ) : reached all 9 states unreached code channel ( proc 1 ) : line 35 ( state 9 ) , reached : 8 of 9 states unreached code transfer ( proc 2 ) : line 24 ( state 18 ) , reached : 17 of 18 states
上記は、5 つの assert 違反があったこと と 165 のユニークなシステムの状態が作られた事を示しています。状態に関しては、各状態のベクタサイズは 64 byte で、循環しない最長のシーケンス は
60 であることを示しています。チャネルプロセスと転送プロセスのどちらにも到達していない状態がひとつあることも示しています。到達していない状態は、それぞれのプロセスの do ループの直後です。どちらのループも終了しないことを意図して作られていることに注意してください。
- l オプションを指定すると、検証プログラムはデッドロックや assert 違反より non-progress ループを探します。このオプションについては " より高度な使い方 " で説明します 。
検証プログラムはさらに 2 つのオプションをサポートしています。デフォルトでは探索の深さは
10,000 ステップに制限されています。もし探索が最大探索深さにまで達した場合は、探索を打ち切るるため検証は部分的になります。確実に全探索を行いたい場合は、" depth reached " が最大探索深さ以内である事を確認し、もしそうでなかった場合は -m オプションを指定して検証を繰り返す必要があります。
- m オプションは、もちろん明示的に探索を打ち切るのにも使用できます。たとえば、 assert を違反する実行シーケンスのうち最短のものを探したいときに使います。このように探索を打ち切る場合は、その探索深さの中での可能なすべての違反を検出する事を保証しません。
最後のオプションは -w N です。これは全状態空間の検証のスコープではなく、実行時間に影響を及ぼします。" hash table width " は通常検証プログラムが生成するシステムのユニークな状態数の予想値の対数と等しく、できれば、大きく設定しなければなりません（もしこれを小さく設定すると、ハッシュの衝突が増加し、探索に時間かかるようになるでしょう）。このデフォルト値
18 では 262,144 状態を扱うことができ、全状態空間探索検証ではこのデフォルト値のままで十分となるようにすべきです。
ビット状態空間検証 （Bit State Space Analyses）
全状態空間探索で検証するときに必要となるメモリ量は簡単に計算する事ができます[4]。もし、上記のプロトコルの例のように、1 状態をエンコードするのに 64 byte 必要で、探索に使用できるシステムのメモリ量が 2MB だとする と、32,768 状態格納する事ができます。もしシステムの状態空間の中で到達可能な状態数がこれ以上になった場合、検証は失敗となります。いまのところ、
Spin はこのトラップを避ける事ができる唯一の検証システムです。他の自動検証システムは（それが基盤としている形式主義に関係なく）、メモリを使い果たすとユーザに役立つ答えを返す事なく検証をやめてしまいます。
従来の検証方法では、メモリの制限に達した場合、そのカバレージは急激に下がってしまいます。たとえば、格納できる状態数の2倍の状態数をもつ状態空間を検証するとき、その探索の有効なカバレージはたったの
50 % です。 Spin ではこのようなケースでもビット状態空間法[ 4]を使う事により十分に良い結果を得られます。ビット状態空間を使うには以下のように検証プログラムをコンパイルします。
$ gcc -DBITSTATE -o pan pan.c
このようにコンパイルされた検証プログラムでももちろん同じように assert 違反を見つけ出す事ができます。
$ ./ pan assertion violated ( i == ( ( last_i + 1 ) ) pan : aborted pan : wrote pan.trail search interrupted vector 64 byte , depth reached 56 61 states , stored 5 states , linked 1 states , matched hash factor : 67650.064516 ( size 2^22 states , stack frames : 0/5 ) $
実際、中程度の大きさの問題を小さくするためにこの方法を使った場合は、全状態空間探索を比べてもほとんど違いはありません（ビット状態空間法の方が多少速く、メモリ使用量が格段に押さえられていることをのぞいてはですが）。しかし大きな問題を扱ったときには、より違いが表れます。出力の最後の
2 行に、カバレージの見積もりが出るので大きなモデルを検証するときには役に立つでしょう。ビット状態空間が適応できる状態の最大数は、最後の行に書いてあります（ここでは、2 22 byte または 3200 万ビット（状態））。その上の行はハッシュ要素を示しています。これは実際の状態数で割った状態の最大数におおよそ等しいです。大きなハッシュ要素（100 以上）は信頼性の高い事を示し、そのカバレージは
99 % か 100 % です。ハッシュ要素が 1 に近づくと、カバレージは 0 % に近づきます。
従来の検証システムが探索できなかった、もしくは、低いカバレージとなっていたケースにおいて部分的なカバレージを実現しているという点に十分に注意してください。しかし
Spin が生成する答えが従来の自動検証システムより信頼性が低いということはありません。
ビット状態検証の目標値は、ビット状態空間のメモリの最大使用量をアロケートすることによりハッシュ要素を
100 以上にすることです。最善の結果を得るには、 -w
N オプションによって状態空間のサイズを正確にあなたのコンピュータで獲得できる実際のメモリ量に適したものにすることです。デフォルトでは
N は 22 で、これに対応する状態空間は 4MB です。たとえば、あなたのコンピュータ が 128 MB のメモリを持っている場合、 - w27 と指定する事により多くの状態について調べる事ができるでしょう。
このマニュアルの最初の部分では、非同期データ通信に限らず
Promela という名の言語による並行システムのモデルの表記法について説明しました。この言語はいくつかのちょっとかわった特徴を持っています。プロセス間の通信は、メッセージか共有変数を介して行われます。同期、非同期通信はどちらも一般化したメッセージ通信の機構の 2 つのケースとしてモデル化されます。 Promela のすべての文は潜在的にモデルをブロックさせる可能性があります。それはその文が実行可能か、実行不可能かにより、ほとんどのケースはプロセスが走っている環境の状態によります。プロセス同士の相互作用とプロセス協調はこの言語の根底にあるものです。
Promela の設計、 Spin による検証とその応用範囲についての詳細は 、 [ 5 ] にあります 。
Promela は、プログラム言語ではなく、検証用のモデリング言語を意図して作られています。例えば、手の込んだ抽象データ型は含んでいませんし、変数の基本型もわずかしかありません。検証モデルはプロトコルの実装を抽象化したものです。抽象化により、プロセスの相互作用の本質的要素を分離して調査する事ができるのです。抽象化により実装とプログラミングに関する詳細を抑え込むのです。
Promela の式、宣言、代入の構文はおおざっぱに C 言語 [ 6 ] を基礎としています。 Promela は E.W. ダイクスト ラ [ 1 ] と C.A.R. ホー ア [ 3 ] の " ガードコマンド言 語 " の影響を大いに受けています。しかし、それらとは重大な違いがあります。ダイクストラの言語はプロセスの相互作用を言語のプリミティブとして持っていません。ホーアの言語は、同期通信のみをベースとしています。またホーアの言語では、ガードの中で使用できる文の種類に制限があります。
Promela の選択と循環文の意味は、他のガードコマンド言語と異なります。すべてのガードが偽のときは、その文は中断されるのではなくブロックされます（必要であれば同期がとられます）。
ユーザは最小限の努力をするだけで、 Promela の検証モデルから洗練された検証プログラムを生成することができます。
Spin 自身、そして生成される検証プログラムどちらも ANSI C で記述されているため 、Unix システム間で移植が可能です。それらは、ホストコンピュータの物理的な限界を引き出すように拡大縮小でき、プロトコルの検証においてその制限の中でできうる最善の検証を実現するものです。
Spin を使った検証においてまず第一にやらなければならない仕事は、手で問題の忠実なモデルを
Promela により記述することです。この言語はわざと小さく作られています。モデリングの目的は調査すべき協調問題に関するシステムの側面を抽出する事です。他の詳細部分は、捨象します。形式的には、モデルは縮小版のシステムであり、検証する特性に関する部分だけフルシステムと等価である必要があります。いったんモデルを構築すると、それは、その特性を検証するために使われる、われわれが " 検証スイート " と呼ぶ一連の構成物の基盤となります。検証スイートを構築するために、モデルに assert を仕掛ける事ができます。 assert により、モデルの中の変数の値やイベントのシーケンスに関する不変条件を形式化することができます。
以下で取り上げる最初の例は、ずいぶん昔に議論され、1966 年に H. Hyman が Communications of the ACM で発表した排他制御の問題に対する解です 。
1 Boolean array b ( 0;1 ) integer k , i , 2 comment process i , with i either 0 or 1 , and k = 1 - i ; 3 C0 : b( i ) := false ; 4 C1 : if k !=
i then begin ; 5 C2 : if not b ( 1 - i ) then go to C2 ; 6 else k := i ; go to C1 end ; 7 else critical section ; 8 b( i ) := true ; 9 remainder of program ; 10 go to C0 ; 11 end
この解は 、Dekker の初期の解として知られるもので 、2 つのプロセス（番号 0 と 1）を対象としたものです。いま 、Hyman の解がクリティカルセクションに対するアクセスの排他制御を完全に保証している事を証明したいとしましょう。われわれの最初の仕事は、
Promela でこの解のモデルを作る事です。ここで、この解で使われている変数に対する名前をよりわかりやすいものにします。
1 bool want [ 2 ] ; /*
Bool array b */ 2 bool turn ; /* integer k */ 3 4 proctype P( bool i) 5 { 6 want [ i ] = 1 ; 7 do 8 :: ( turn != i ) -> 9 ( ! want [ 1 - i ] ) ; 10 turn = i 11 :: ( turn == i ) -> 12 break 13 od ; 14 skip ; /* critical section */ 15 want [ i ] = 0 16 } 17 18 init { run P( 0 ) ; run P ( 1 ) }
このモデルの検証プログラムを生成、コンパイルすることで、デッドロックのような主要な問題があれば、それを見つける事ができます。
$ spin - a hyman0 $ gcc -o pan pan.c $ ./ pan full statespace search for : assertion violations and invalid endstates vector 20 byte , depth reached 19 , errors : 0 79 states , stored 0 states , linked 38 states , matched total : 117 hash conflicts : 4 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 3/0 ) unreached code _init ( proc 0 ) : reached all 3 states unreached code P ( proc 1 ) : reached all 12 states
このモデルは最初のテストにパスしました。しかし、われわれが本当に興味があるのは、このアルゴリズムが排他制御を保証しているかどうか、についてです。これにはいくつかの方法がありますが、最も簡単な方法は単に正当性を表明する assert をモデルに加えることです。
1 bool want [ 2 ] ; 2 bool turn ; 3 byte cnt ; 4 5 proctype P ( bool i ) 6 { 7 want [ i ] = 1 ; 8 do 9 :: ( turn != i ) -> 10 ( ! want [ 1 - i ] ) ; 11 turn = i 12 :: ( turn == i ) -> 13 break 14 od ; 15 skip ; /* critical section */ 16 cnt = cnt+1 ; 17 assert ( cnt == 1 ) ; 18 cnt = cnt -1 ; 19 want [ i ] = 0 20 } 21 22 init { run P( 0 ) ; run P ( 1 ) }
ここでは、グローバル変数 cnt を追加し、クリティカルセクションに侵入したときに
+1、クリティカルセクションからでるときに
-1 するようにしました。この変数の値がとりうる最大値は 1 であり、ひとつのプロセスがクリティカルセクション内にいるときのみ 1 になります。
$ spin - a hyman1 $ gcc -o pan pan.c $ ./ pan assertion violated ( cnt==1 ) pan : aborted ( at depth 15 ) pan : wrote pan.trail full statespace search for : assertion violations and invalid endstates search was not completed vector 20 byte , depth reached 25 , errors : 1 123 states , stored 0 states , linked 55 states , matched total : 178 hash conflicts : 42 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 3/0 )
検証プログラムは assert 違反があったと報告しています。このエラーシーケンスをチェックするために
Spin に -t オプションを指定してその軌跡を見てみましょう。
$ spin -t -p hyman1 proc 0 ( _init ) line 24 ( state 2 ) proc 0 ( _init ) line 24 ( state 3 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 8 ( state 7 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 9 ( state 2 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 10 ( state 3 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 11 ( state 4 ) proc 1 ( P ) line 8 ( state 7 ) proc 1 ( P ) line 12 ( state 5 ) proc 1 ( P ) line 15 ( state 10 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 8 ( state 7 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 12 ( state 5 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 15 ( state 10 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 16 ( state 11 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 17 ( state 12 ) proc 2 ( P ) line 18 ( state 13 ) proc 1 ( P ) line 16 ( state 11 ) proc 1 ( P ) line 17 ( state 12 ) spin : " hyman1 " line 17 : assertion violated step 17 , # processes : 3 want [ 0 ] = 1 _p [ 0 ] = 12 turn [ 0 ] = 1 cnt [ 0 ] = 2 proc 2 ( P ) line 18 ( state 13 ) proc 1 ( P ) line 17 ( state 12 ) proc 0 ( _init ) line 24 ( state 3 ) 3 processes created
さて、もうひとつのエラーの発見方法を見てみましょう。もう一度モデルにクリティカルセクション内のプロセスの数に関する情報を加えます。
1 bool want [ 2 ] ; 2 bool turn ; 3 byte cnt ; 4 5 proctype P ( bool i ) 6 { 7 want [ i ] = 1 ; 8 do 9 :: ( turn != i ) -> 10 ( ! want [ 1 - i ] ) ; 11 turn = i 12 :: ( turn == i ) -> 13 break 14 od ; 15 cnt = cnt+1 ; 16 skip ; /* critical section */ 17 cnt = cnt -1 ; 18 want [ i ] = 0 19 } 20 21 proctype monitor ( ) 22 { 23 assert ( cnt == 0 || cnt == 1 ) 24 } 25 26 init { 27 run P ( 0 ) ; run P ( 1 ) ; run monitor ( ) 28 }
今度は、カウンタ cnt の値に関する不変条件は、独立したプロセス monitor ( )
（名前に特に意味はないのですが）におかれました。この追加されたプロセスは、2 つのプロセスとともに走ります。このプロセスは 1 ステップを実行し終了しますが、これはシステムの実行中のどのタイミングでも実行する可能性があります。
Promela によりモデル化されたシステム、および、
Spin により検証されるシステムは、完全な非同期です。よって、
Spin による検証は 3 つのプロセスの可能なすべてのタイミングを検証の対象とするため、この assert は他の 2 つのプロセスの生存期間のあらゆるタイミングで評価されるのです。もし検証プログラムが違反を報告しなかった場合は、われわれは assert 違反を犯すような実行シーケンスが（3 つのプロセスの実行スピードによらず）まったくないことと結論づける事ができるのです。monitor プロセスによるシステムの不変条件の妥当性をチェックする方法は洗練された方法です。検証プログラムは以下のような結果を報告するでしょう。
$ spin - a hyman2 $ gcc -o pan pan.c $ ./ pan assertion violated ( ( cnt==0 ) ||( cnt==1 ) ) pan : aborted ( at depth 15 ) pan : wrote pan.trail full statespace search for : assertion violations and invalid endstates search was not completed vector 24 byte , depth reached 26 , errors : 1 368 states , stored 0 states , linked 379 states , matched total : 747 hash conflicts : 180 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 4/0 )
2 つのプロセスと 3 番目の monitor プロセスとの余分なインターリービングのため、探索すべきシステム状態数が増えていますが、エラーは正しく報告されています。
もうひとつの例 ( Another Example ）
システムの正当性がいつでもグローバルな不変条件という観点から与えられるという訳ではありません。この例はそれを示したものです。これは単純なビット交換プロトコル（alternating bit protocol）で、メッセージの損失、ゆがみをモデリングし、否定応答（negative acknowledgements）により拡張したものです。
1 #define MAX 5 2 3 mtype = { mesg , ack , nak , err } ; 4 5 proctype sender ( chan in , out ) 6 { byte o , s , r ; 7 8 o=MAX - 1 ; 9 do 10 :: o = ( o+1 ) %MAX ; /* next msg */ 11 again : if 12 :: out!mesg(o,s ) /* send */ 13 :: out!err ( 0,0 ) /* distort */ 14 :: skip /* or lose */ 15 fi ; 16 if 17 :: timeout -> goto again 18 :: in?err ( 0,0 ) -> goto again 19 :: in ?nak( r,0 ) -> goto again 20 :: in?ack( r,0 ) -> 21 if 22 :: ( r == s ) -> goto progress 23 :: ( r != s ) -> goto again 24 fi 25 fi ; 26 progress : s = 1 -s /* toggle seqno */ 27 od 28 } 29 30 proctype receiver ( chan in , out ) 31 { byte i ; /* actual input */ 32 byte s ; /* actual seqno */ 33 byte es ; /* expected seqno */ 34 byte ei ; /* expected input */ 35 36 do 37 :: in? mesg( i , s ) -> 38 if 39 :: ( s == es ) -> 40 assert ( i == ei ) ; 41 progress : es = 1 - es ; 42 ei = ( ei + 1 ) %MAX ; 43 if 44 /* send , */ :: out !ack( s,0 ) 45 /* distort */ :: out !err ( 0,0 ) 46 /* or lose */ :: skip 47 fi 48 :: ( s != es ) -> 49 if 50 /* send , */ :: out !nak( s,0 ) 51 /* distort */ :: out !err ( 0,0 ) 5 2 /* or lose */ :: skip 53 fi 54 fi 55 :: in?err -> 56 out ! nak( s,0 ) 57 od 58 } 59 60 init { 61 chan s_r = [ 1 ] of { mtype , byte , byte } ; 62 chan r_s = [ 1 ] of { mtype , byte , byte } ; 63 atomic { 64 run sender ( r_s , s_r ) ; 65 run receiver ( s_r , r_s ) 66 } 67 }
このプロトコルが正しくデータを転送するという命題をテストするために、このモデルにはすでにいくつかの assert が挿入されています。sender はメッセージとして MAX を法とする剰余からなる無限列を転送するように定義されています。
MAX の値は重要ではなく、プロトコルの中でシーケンス番号の幅（今のケースでは
2）より大きければ何でもかまいません。たとえメッセージの損失の可能性があろうとも送信されたデータが消えたり、並べ替えられたりすることなく receiver に届けられることが検証したいのです 。40 行目の assert により正確にそれを検証します。もし上記に書いた要求が満たせない可能性がある場合は、この assert の違反が検出されます 。
最初の検証では、そういった問題の可能性がなく、われわれを安心させてくれます。
$ spin -a ABP0 $ gcc -o pan pan.c $ ./ pan full statespace search for : assertion violations and invalid endstates vector 40 byte , depth reached 131 , errors : 0 346 states , stored 1 states , linked 125 states , matched total : 472 hash conflicts : 17 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 0/25 ) unreached code _init ( proc 0 ) : reached all 4 states unreached code receiver ( proc 1 ) : line 58 ( state 24 ) reached : 23 of 24 states unreached code sender ( proc 2 ) : line 28 ( state 27 ) reached : 26 of 27 states
しかし注意してください。この結果は送信されたメッセージが正しい順番で届けられたことを意味しているのにすぎません。われわれはデータがかならず転送されるということはチェックしていません。sender
と receiver が何も有効なメッセージを送らずエラーメッセージを交換してぐるぐるまわっている可能性もあります。これをチェックするために、sender と receiver がミスする事なく前進していることを示す各プロセスの状態に " プログレス状 態 " のラベルをはります（実際には片方のプロセスだけで十分なのですが）。
これでプログレス状態をまったく通過しないまま実行サイクルが繰り返される事がない事を検証できるようになりました。先の実行ファイルはそのまま使えないので、ノンプログレスサイクルを見つけるために検証プログラムをコンパイルしなおします。
$ gcc - DNP - o pan pan.c $ ./ pan -l pan : non-progress cycle ( at depth 6 ) pan : wrote pan.trail full statespace search for : assertion violations and non-progress loops search was not completed vector 44 byte , depth reached 8 , loops : 1 12 states , stored 1 states , linked 0 states , matched total : 13 hash conflicts : 0 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 0/1 )
結果によると、少なくともひとつのノンプログレスサイクルがあります。最初に見つけたものは検証プログラムにより trail ファイルにその軌跡が保存されていて、われわれをそれを見る事ができます。その結果を図
2 の前半に示します。メッセージのゆがみや損失が何度も繰り返し続けられており、事実エラーですが、エラーシーケンスとしてはあまり面白くありません。ノンプログレスサイクルがいくつ存在するのか見るために、 -c フラグを使ってみます。 -c オプションの引数に 0 を設定した場合は、エラーの合計数が出力されます。
$ pan -l - c0 full statespace search for : assertion violations and non-progress loops vector 44 byte , depth reached 137 , loops : 92 671 states , stored 2 states , linked 521 states , matched total : 1194 hash conflicts : 39 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 0/26 )
エラーは 、92 ケースあります。 -c オプションを -c1 , - c2 , - c3 , ... のように順に使ってそのシーケンスをひとつずつ見る事ができます。しかし、最初に見つかったメッセージの損失を繰り返す事を原因とするエラーシーケンスを取り除いて、少しやるべき事を減らすことができます。そのために " progress " の 8 文字から始まる接頭語をつけたラベルをメッセージを損失している各行（13 , 43 , 48 行目）に張り、残るエラーサイクルを見ます（ラベルは :: の後ろに挿入します）*4。
$ spin -a ABP1 $ gcc - DNP - o pan pan.c $ ./ pan -l pan : non-progress cycle ( at depth 133 ) pan : wrote pan.trail full statespace search for : assertion violations and non-progress loops search was not completed vector 44 byte , depth reached 136 , loops : 1 148 states , stored 2 states , linked 2 states , matched total : 152 hash conflicts : 0 ( resolved ) ( size 2^18 states , stack frames : 0/26 )
今度は、生成された軌跡によりこのプロトコルにおける真に深刻なバグを明らかにすることができます。図 2 の後半にその軌跡を示します。
$ spin -t -r -s ABP0 <<<< >>>> proc 1 ( sender ) line 13 , Send err,0,0 -> queue 2 ( out ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 55 , Recv err,0,0 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 56 , Send nak , 0,0 -> queue 1 ( out ) proc 1 ( sender ) line 19 , Recv nak , 0,0 <- queue 1 ( in ) spin : trail ends after 12 steps step 12 , # processes : 3 _p [ 0 ] = 6 proc 2 ( receiver ) line 36 ( state 21 ) proc 1 ( sender ) line 11 ( state 6 ) proc 0 ( _init ) line 67 ( state 4 ) 3 processes created $ $ spin -t -r -s ABP1 ... proc 2 ( receiver ) line 39 , Recv mesg , 0,0 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 47 , Send err, 0,0 -> queue 1 ( out ) proc 1 ( sender ) line 20 , Recv err , 1,0 <- queue 1 ( in ) proc 1 ( sender ) line 12 , Send mesg , 0,0 -> queue 2 ( out ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 39 , Recv mesg , 0,0 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 52 , Send nak , 0,0 -> queue 1 ( out ) proc 1 ( sender ) line 21 , Recv nak , 0,0 <- queue 1 ( in ) proc 1 ( sender ) line 12 , Send mesg , 0,0 -> queue 2 ( out ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 39 , Recv mesg , 0,0 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 52 , Send nak , 0,0 -> queue 1 ( out ) <<<< >>>> proc 1 ( sender ) line 21 , Recv nak , 0,0 <- queue 1 ( in ) proc 1 ( sender ) line 12 , Send mesg , 0,0 -> queue 2 ( out ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 39 , Recv mesg , 0,0 <- queue 2 ( in ) proc 2 ( receiver ) line 52 , Send nak , 0,0 -> queue 1 ( out ) spin : trail ends after 226 steps ... 図 2 . エラーの軌跡 - 拡張した Alternating Bit Protocol
ひとつの（成功を示す ）acknowledgment がゆがめられて転送されると、sender と receiver は無限サイクルに陥ってしまいます。sender は acknowledgment を受け取っていないので頑固に最後に送ったメッセージを繰り返し送信します、また、receiver もまた頑固に否定応答（negative acknowledgment）を送り拒否し続けます。
さらに深く掘り下げる （Digging Deeper）
このマニュアルは Spin の主要な機能の概要と検証で使えるより一般的なやり方について説明しているにすぎません。
Spin には、ここで取り上げたもの以外にも、検証の問題に立ち向かうのに役に立つであろうたくさんの機能があります。
Spin ではまた " タスク " や " 要求 " を never - claim でモデル化することでシステムがそれを満たすかどうか検証することもできます。ユーザがシステムが達成すべきタスクを形式化して claim で表現すると 、
Spin は素早くその claim が成り立つ事を証明するか、反例を示すでしょう。never - claim は Büchiオートマトン*5と等価で、線形時相論理をつかった制約をモデル化可能です。新しいバーションの
Spin では、要求を定義するのに LTL の構文を使う事ができます 。 Spin はユーザが定義した LTL をそれと等価な never - claim に変換することができます 。
Spin ではまた、ユーザが定義したサブセットに探索を制限するようにシステムの状態空間を縮小する事ができます（ここでも never - claim を使用しますが、今度は状態空間を切り取るために使用します）。この方法により、たとえ全状態空間探索が実行不可能でも、システムの振る舞いに与えたエラーのパターンが含まれるかどうかをすばやく検証することができます。

訳注 : Büchiは" ビューヒ " とか " ビュッ ヒ " と発音します 。
Patrick Cockburn has been hailed by Sidney Blumenthal in Salon as “ one of the most accurate and intrepid journalists in Iraq . ”
And that ’s hardly praise enough , given what the man has done .
The Middle Eastern correspondent for the British newspaper The Independent , he ’s been on the spot from the moment when , in February 2003 , he secretly crossed the Tigris River into Iraq just before the Bush administration launched its invasion .
Here , for instance , is a typical striking passage of his , written in May 2003 , just weeks after Baghdad fell .
If you read it then , you hardly needed the massive retrospective volumes like Thomas Rick ’s Fiasco that took years to come out :
“ [ T ] he civilian leadership of the Pentagon are uniquely reckless , arrogant and ill informed about Iraq .
At the end of last year [ Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul ]
Wolfowitz was happily saying that he thought the Iraqi reaction to the capture of Baghdad would be much like the entry of the U.S. Army into Paris in 1944 .
He also apparently believed that Ahmed Chalabi , then as now one of the most unpopular men in Iraq , would be the Iraqi Charles de Gaulle .
“ These past mistakes matter because the situation in Iraq could easily become much worse .
Iraqis realize that Saddam may have gone but that the United States does not have real control of the country .
Last week , just as a [ n ] emissary [ from head of the U.S. occupation Paul Bremer ] was telling academics at Mustansiriyah , the ancient university in the heart of Baghdad , who should be purged from their staff , several gunmen , never identified , drove up and calmly shot dead the deputy dean . ”
How much worse it ’s become can be measured by the two suicide bombs that went off at the same university a month apart early in 2007 , killing not a single deputy dean but more than 100 ( mostly female ) students .
Or it can be measured by this telling little tidbit written in October 2003 : “ The most amazing achievement of six months of American occupation has been that it has even provoked nostalgia in parts of Iraq for Saddam .
In Baiji , protesters were holding up his picture and chanting : ‘ With our blood and with our spirit we will die for you Saddam . ’
Who would have believed this when his statue was toppled just six months ago ? ”
Or by this description , written in the same month , which offers a vivid sense of why an insurgency really took off in that country :
“ US soldiers driving bulldozers , with jazz blaring from loudspeakers , have uprooted ancient groves of date palms as well as orange and lemon trees in central Iraq as part of a new policy of collective punishment of farmers who do not give information about guerrillas attacking US troops
Asked how much his lost orchard was worth , Nusayef Jassim said in a distraught voice :
‘ It is as if someone cut off my hands and you asked me how much my hands were worth . ' ”
Or by this singular detail from June 2004 that caught the essence of the lawlessness the U.S. occupation let loose : “ Kidnap is now so common [ that ] new words have been added to Iraqi thieves ’ slang .
A kidnap victim is called al - tali or the sheep . ”
Or this summary of the situation in May 2004 , one year after Bush ’s “ Mission Accomplished ” speech : “ Saddam should not have been a hard act to follow .
After 30 years of disastrous wars , Iraqis wanted a quiet life .
All the Americans really needed to do was to get the relatively efficient Iraqi administration up and running again .
Instead , they let the government dissolve , and have never successfully resurrected it .
It has been one of the most extraordinary failures in history . ”
Last September , typically , Cockburn traveled on his own to dangerous Diyala Province just as the fighting there was heating to a boil .
He summed up the situation parenthetically , as well as symbolically , when he commented that Diyala was not a place “ to make a mistake in map reading . ”
Cockburn should gather in awards for guts , nerve , understanding , and just plain great war reporting .
Before heading back to Iraq yet again , he put his years of reporting and observation together in an already classic book , The Occupation : War and Resistance in Iraq , which no political library should be without .
The following essay that he just wrote in Baghdad will be the introduction to the paperback edition of that book , when released this fall  and special thanks go to his publisher , Verso , for letting this site post it .

A Small War Guaranteed to Damage a Superpower
by Patrick Cockburn
At 3 am on January 11 , 2007 a fleet of American helicopters made a sudden swoop on the long - established Iranian liaison office in the city of Arbil in northern Iraq .
Their mission was to capture two senior Iranian security officials , Mohammed Jafari , the deputy head of the Iranian National Security Council , and General Minojahar Frouzanda , the head of intelligence of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
What made the American raid so extraordinary is that both men were in Iraq at the official invitation of the Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , who held talks with them at his lakeside headquarters at Dokan in eastern Kurdistan .
The Iranians had then asked to see Massoud Barzani , the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government , in the Kurdish capital Arbil .
There was nothing covert about the meeting which was featured on Kurdish television .
In the event the U.S. attack failed .
It was only able to net five junior Iranian officials at the liaison office that had existed in Arbil for years , issuing travel documents , and which was being upgraded to a consular office by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry in Baghdad .
The Kurdish leaders were understandably furious asking why , without a word to them , their close allies , the Americans , had tried to abduct two important foreign officials who were in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi president .
Kurdish troops had almost opened fire on the American troops .
At the very least , the raid showed a contempt for Iraqi sovereignty which the U.S. was supposedly defending .
It was three months before officials in Washington admitted that they had tried and failed to capture Jafari and General Frouzanda .
The U.S. State Department and Iraqi government argued for the release of the five officials as relative minnows , but Vice President Cheney ’s office insisted fiercely that they should be held .
If Iran had undertaken a similar venture by , for example , trying to kidnap the deputy head of the CIA when he was on an official visit to Pakistan or Afghanistan , then Washington might have considered the attempt a reason for going to war .
In the event , the US assault on Arbil attracted bemused attention inside and outside Iraq for only a few days before it was buried by news of the torrent of violence in the rest of Iraq .
The U.S. understandably did not reveal the seniority of its real targets  or that they had escaped .

The Arbil raid is significant because it was the first visible sign of a string of highly significant American policy decisions announced by President George W. Bush in an address to the nation broadcast in the U.S. a few hours earlier on January 10 .
There have been so many spurious turning points in the war  such as the capture of Saddam Hussein in 2003 , the handover of sovereignty to an Iraqi government in 2004 , or the elections of 2005  that truly critical moments are obscured or underrated .
The true importance of Bush ’s words took time to sink in .
In the months prior to his speech , the U.S. seemed to be feeling its way towards an end to the war .
The Republicans had lost control of both houses of Congress in the November 2006 elections , an unexpectedly heavy defeat blamed on the Iraq war .
Soon afterwards , the bipartisan Iraqi Study Group of senior Republicans and Democrats , led by James Baker and Lee Hamilton , spelled out the extent of American failure thus far , arguing for a reduced U.S. military commitment and suggesting negotiations with Iran and Syria .
President Bush did the exact opposite of what the Baker - Hamilton report had proposed .
He identified Iran and Syria as America ’s prime enemies in Iraq , stating : “ These two regimes are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their territory to move in and out of Iraq . ”
Instead of reducing the American commitment , Bush pledged to send 20,000 extra troops to Iraq to try to secure Baghdad .
In other words , the U.S. was going to respond to its lack of success in the conflict by escalating both the war in Iraq and America ’s confrontation with Iran in the Middle East as a whole .
The invasion of 2003 had destabilized the whole region ; now Bush was about to deepen that instability .
The raid on Arbil showed that the new policies were not just rhetoric .
Iraqis were quicker than the rest of the world to pick up on what was happening .
“ People are saying that Bush ’s speech means that the occupation is going to go on a long time , ” the Iraqi political scientist Ghassan Attiyah told me soon after the president had stopped speaking .
Although the new U.S. security plan for Baghdad , which began on February 14th , was sold as a temporary “ surge ” in troop numbers , it was evident that the reinforcements were there to stay .
In April , the Pentagon announced that it was increasing Army tours in Iraq from 12 to 15 months .
Without anybody paying much attention , American officials stopped talking about training Iraqi army troops as a main priority .
This was an important shift in emphasis .
Training and equipping Iraqi troops to replace American soldiers  so they could be withdrawn from Iraq  had been the cornerstone of U.S. military planning since 2005 .
Now , the policy was being quietly downgraded , though not abandoned altogether .
Could the new strategy succeed ?
It seemed very unlikely .
The U.S. had failed to pacify Iraq between 2003 and 2007 .
Now , with much of the American public openly disillusioned with the war , Bush was to try for victory once again .
Common sense suggested that he needed to reduce the number of America ’s enemies inside and outside Iraq , but his new strategy was only going to increase them .
The U.S. Army was to go on fighting the five - million - strong Sunni community , as it had been doing since the capture of Baghdad .
The Sunni demand for a timetable for U.S. withdrawal was not being met .
At the same time , the U.S. was going to deal more aggressively with the 17 million Shias in Iraq .
It would contest the control over much of Baghdad and southern Iraq of the Mehdi Army , the powerful militia led by the nationalist Shia cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , who is regarded with cult - like devotion by many Shia Iraqis .
Not content with this , Washington was also more openly going to confront Iran , the most powerful of Iraq ’s neighbors .
As with so many U.S. policies under Bush , the new strategy made sense in terms of American domestic politics , but in Iraq seemed a recipe for disaster .
Iran was easy to demonize in the U.S. , just as Saddam Hussein had been blamed four years earlier for everything wrong in Iraq and the Middle East .
The New York Times , which had once uncritically repeated White House claims that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction , now ran articles on its front page saying that Iran was exporting sophisticated roadside bombs to Iraq that were killing American soldiers .
There was no reference to the embarrassing discoveries of workshops making just such bombs in Baghdad and Basra .
Above all , the Bush administration was determined to put off the day  at least until after the Presidential election in 2008  when it had to admit that the U.S. had failed in Iraq .
A Security Plan Lacking Security
I was in Baghdad soon after Bush had spoken .
I had never known it to be so bad .
My driver had to take a serpentine route from the airport , driving along the main highway , then suddenly doing a U - turn to dart down an alleyway .
He was trying to avoid checkpoints that might be manned by Police Commandos in their mottled uniforms who often acted as Shia death squads .
The journey to the al - Hamra Hotel in Jadriyah , a district built in a loop of the Tigris river , took three times as long as normal .
In the following days , I could see Mehdi Army checkpoints , civilians with guns and a car slewed across the road , operating almost within sight of the heavily guarded July 14 Bridge that leads to the Green Zone .
The extent of the military failure over the previous three - and - a - half years was extraordinary .
The foreign media never quite made clear how little territory the U.S. and the Iraqi army fully controlled  even in the heart of Baghdad .
It was astonishing , in early 2007 , to look out from the north - facing windows in the Hamra and see columns of black smoke billowing up from Haifa Street on the other side of the Tigris river .
This is a two mile long militant Sunni corridor less than a mile from the northern end of the Green Zone .
Since the early days of the fighting , the U.S. Army , supported by Iraqi army troops , had been unsuccessfully trying to drive out the insurgents who ruled it .
Sometimes , U.S. commanders persuaded themselves ( and embedded journalists ) that they were making progress .
On this occasion , I looked up and read a long , optimistic article about Haifa Street in an American paper , claiming there were signs that “ the tide was turning on Iraq ’s street of fear . ”
It was no longer an arrow pointing at the heart of the Green Zone ; rebel leaders had been arrested or killed ; large weapons caches had been discovered ; insurgent attacks were less intense and less frequent ; Iraqi troops were at last being effectively deployed .
Having finished reading the piece , I was reflecting on whether or not the U.S. military and its local allies were at last achieving something on Haifa Street when I glanced at the piece and realized , with a groan , that it was dated March 2005 , almost two years earlier .
American commanders often genuinely believed that they were in command of towns and cities which Iraqis , including the local police , told me were dominated by Sunni insurgents or Shia militia .
On one occasion in early 2007 , senior U.S. and Iraqi officers were giving a video press conference from Diyala , a much fought over province northeast of Baghdad , confidently claiming that they were winning the fight against the Sunni rebels .
Even as they were speaking an insurgent squad attacked and captured the mayor ’s office in Baquba , the capital of Diyala .
It only withdrew after blowing up the building and kidnapping the mayor .
The government announced that it was dismissing 1,500 policemen in Diyala because of their repeated failure to resist the insurgents .
When I checked with a police commander a few months later he said threw up his hands in disgust and said that not a single policeman had been fired .
The addition , promised by Bush , of five extra brigades to the U.S. forces in Baghdad made , at least at first , some difference to security in the capital .
The number of bodies of people tortured , shot in the head , and dumped in the street , went down from the horrific levels of late 2006 .
These death - squad killings were mostly of Sunni and were the work of the Mehdi Army or of army and police units collaborating with them .
A few days before the security plan began , Muqtada al - Sadr stood down his militiamen , telling them to dump their arms and move out of Baghdad .
He was intent on avoiding direct military confrontation with the U.S. reinforcements .
But while the Shia were killing fewer Sunni , the Sunni insurgents were still slaughtering Shia civilians with massive suicide bombs , often vehicle - borne , targeting crowded market places .
These did not stop and improved security measures made little difference .
On February 3 , a truck delivering vegetables blew up in the Shia - Kurdish Sadriya quarter in central Baghdad killing 135 people and wounding 305 .
Ten weeks later , long after the Security Plan had been launched , another vehicle bomb blew up in the same market , killing 127 people and wounding 148 .
Not surprisingly , local people jeered and threw stones at American and Iraqi soldiers who turned up after the explosion .
The main failing of the security plan for ordinary Iraqis , many of whom had initially welcomed it , was simply that it did not deliver security for them or their families .
Who Rules Iraq ?
There was a central lesson of four years of war which Bush and Tony Blair never seemed to take on board , though it was obvious to anybody living in Iraq : the occupation was unpopular and becoming more so by the day .
Anti-American guerrillas and militiamen always had enough water to swim in .
The only community in Iraq that fully supported the U.S. presence was the Kurds  and Kurdistan was not occupied .
It is this lack of political support that has so far doomed all U.S. political and military actions in Iraq .
It makes the country very different from Afghanistan where foreign troops are far more welcome .
Opinion polls consistently show this trend .
A comprehensive Iraqi survey has been conducted by ABC News , USAToday , the BBC , and ARD annually over the last three years .
Its findings illuminate the most important trends in Iraqi politics .
They show that , by March 2007 , no less than 78 % of Iraqis opposed the presence of U.S. forces , compared to 65 % in November 2005 and 51 % in February 2004 .
In the latter year , only 17 % of the population thought that violence against U.S. forces was acceptable , while by 2007 the figure had risen to 51 % .
This pool of people sympathetic to Sunni insurgents and Shia militias was so large as to make it difficult to control and impossible to eliminate them .
Again and again , assassinations and bombs showed that the Iraqi army and police were thoroughly infiltrated by militants from all sides .
Nowhere was safe .
Some incidents are well known .
In April 2007 , a suicide bomber blew himself up in the café of the Iraqi parliament in its heavily defended building in the Green Zone .
The bomber had somehow circumvented seven or eight layers of security .
Earlier , on March 23 , the deputy prime minister , Salam al - Zubaie , was badly injured by a bomber who got close to him with the connivance of his bodyguards .
There were lesser unknown incidents indicative of the divided loyalties of the security forces .
On March 6 , militants from the Islamic State of Iraq movement  of which al Qaida in Iraq is part  stormed Badoush prison northwest of Mosul .
In the biggest jailbreak since 2003 , they freed 68 prisoners of whom 57 were foreign .
Of the 1,200 guards at the prison , 400 - 500 were on duty at the time , but did nothing to stop the Islamic militants breaking in or the prisoners breaking out .
Some American soldiers see that the problem is not about a few infiltrators .
“ Any Iraqi officer who has n’t been assassinated or targeted for assassination is giving information or support to the insurgents , ” one US marine was quoted as saying .
“ Any Iraqi officer who is n’t in bed with the insurgents is already dead . ”
Some problems facing the U.S. and Britain in Iraq have not changed since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 .
Getting rid of the Iraqi leader was far easier than finding a successor regime that would not be more dangerous to American interests .
It is a dilemma still unresolved more than four years into the occupation .
A prime reason why the U.S. supported Saddam Hussein during his war with Iran in 1980 - 88 is that it did not want a Shia clerical regime , possibly sympathetic to America ’s enemies in Tehran , to come to power in Iraq .
It was the same motive that stopped President Bush senior pushing on to Baghdad and overthrowing Saddam after defeating the Iraqi army in Kuwait in 1991 .
After 2003 , Washington was in the same quandary :
If elections were held , the Shia , comprising 60 % of the population that had been long excluded from power , were bound to win .
The nightmare for Washington was to find that it had conquered Iraq only to install black - turbaned clerics in power in Baghdad , as they already were in Tehran .
At first , the U.S. tried to postpone elections , claiming that a census had to be held .
It was only on the insistence of the Shia Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani that two elections were held in 2005 , in which the Shia religious parties triumphed .
Washington has never been comfortable with these Shia - Kurdish governments .
It demanded that they try to reconcile with the Sunni  though exactly how Shia and Kurdish leaders are supposed to do this , given that the main Sunni demand is a timetable for an American withdrawal , has never been clear .
For their part , the Shia , have become increasingly suspicious that the U.S. and Britain do not intend to relinquish real control over security to the elected Iraqi government .
There were many examples of this .
For instance , in the Middle East the most important force underpinning every government is the intelligence service .
In theory ( as I explain in my book , The Occupation : War and Resistance in Iraq ) , the Iraqi government should get its information from the Iraqi National Intelligence Service ( INIS ) that was established in 2004 by the US - run Coalition Provisional Authority .
But a peculiarity of the INIS is that its budget is not provided by the Iraqi Finance Ministry but by the CIA .
Over the next three years , they paid $ 3 billion to fund its activities .
During this time it was run by General Mohammed Shahwani , who had been the central figure in a CIA - run coup in 1996 against Saddam Hussein that had failed disastrously .
For long periods he was even banned from attending Iraqi cabinet meetings .
A former Iraqi cabinet minister , who was a member of the country ’s National Security Council , complained to me that “ we only get information that the CIA wants us to hear . ”
Iraqis did not fail to spot the extent to which the power of their elected government was being trimmed .
The poll cited above showed that by Spring 2007 only 34 % of Iraqis thought their country was being run by their own government ; 59 % believed the U.S. was in control .
The Iraqi government had been robbed of legitimacy in the eyes of its own people .
Destabilizing Iraq
In the course of 2006 and 2007 , Baghdad disintegrated into a dozen hostile cities at war with each other .
There were fewer and fewer mixed Sunni and Shia neighborhoods .
Terror engulfed the city like a poisonous cloud .
There was a lot to be frightened of : Sunni insurgent groups ; the Shia militias , Mehdi Army , and the Badr Organization ; police and police commandos ; the Iraqi army and the Americans .
One day I received an e-mail message from an old friend .
He wrote : “ Yesterday the cousin of my stepbrother ( as you know , my father married twice ) was killed by Badr troops three days after he was arrested .
His body was found in the trash in al - Shula district .
He was one of three other people who were killed after heavy torture .
They did nothing , but they are Sunni people among the huge numbers of Shia people in the General Factory for Cotton in al - Khadamiyah where they were working .
His family could n’t recognize his face [ and only knew it was him ] because of the wart on his arm . ”
Most of my Iraqi friends had fled Iraq for Jordan or Syria or , when they could get a visa , Western Europe .
Soon , I could not enter the coffee shop of The Four Seasons , the hotel where I usually stayed in the Jordanian capital of Amman , without seeing several Iraqis I knew sitting at other tables .
These were the better - off .
The poor often had to chose between staying in jobs where they were at risk , becoming permanently unemployed , or taking flight .
I was in contact with a Sunni family called al - Mashadani who lived in the west Baghdad district of Hurriya .
It was under attack by Shia militiamen .
Khalid , the father , worked as mechanic in the railway station .
He was forced to leave his job when the repair yard was taken over by Shia militiamen .
He stayed away and asked a Shia fellow worker to pick up his salary .
This worked until the Shia militias found out what was happening and threatened to kill any Shia who passed on the salary of a Sunni .
Khalid was forced to leave for Syria where he found work .
He left behind his wife , Nadia , and four children , the eldest of whom was eight years old .
Living with them in the house was Nadia ’s sister , Sarah , whose husband had been an ordinary guard at the Oil Ministry building .
He was killed by the resistance who considered that his job made him a collaborator with the government .
On December 25 , 2006 , this whole family group was told by the Shia militia to get out of their house immediately without taking any possessions or be killed .
They fled into the night and sat beside the road until a charitable minibus driver picked them up .
Eventually , they found refuge in a school .
Nadia recalled that “ we stayed 29 days in a dark and damp room and we could n’t go out of it when the students were studying . ”
Her husband in Syria offered to return , but she told him to stay because the family could not afford for him to lose his job .
Nadia blames the Americans for the sectarian civil war that had engulfed her family .
She says : “ We were living together , Sunni and Shia , and there was no sign of sectarian differences between us in Iraq until the Americans came and encouraged sectarianism and let in foreign terrorists . ”
Many Iraqis similarly see sectarianism as the work of the Americans .
This is not entirely fair .
Sectarian differences in Iraq were deeper under Saddam Hussein and his predecessors than many Iraqis now admit .
But in one important respect , foreign occupation did encourage and deepen sectarianism .
Previously a Sunni might feel differently from a Shia but still feel they were both Iraqis .
Iraqi nationalism did exist , though Sunni and Shia defined it differently .
But the Sunnis fought the U.S. occupation , unlike the Shia who were prepared to cooperate with it .
After 2003 , the Sunni saw the Shia who took a job as a policeman as not only a member of a different community , but as a traitor to his country .
Sectarian and national antipathies combined to produce a lethal brew .
The war in Iraq that started in 2003 has now lasted longer than the First World War .
Militarily , the conflicts could not be more different .
The scale of the fighting in Iraq is far below anything seen in 1914 - 18 , but the political significance of the Iraq war has been enormous .
America blithely invaded Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein to show its great political and military strength .
Instead it demonstrated its weakness .
The vastly expensive U.S. war machine failed to defeat a limited number of Sunni Arab guerrillas .
International leaders such as Tony Blair who confidently allied themselves to Washington at the start of the war , convinced that they were betting on a winner , are either discredited or out of power .
At times , President Bush seemed intent on finding out how much damage could be done to the U.S. by the conflict in Iraq .
He did so by believing a high proportion of his own propaganda about the resistance to the occupation being limited in scale and inspired from outside the country .
By 2007 , the administration was even claiming that the fervently anti-Iranian Sunni insurgents were being equipped by Iran .
It was a repeat performance of U.S , assertions four years earlier that Saddam Hussein was backing al - Qaeda .
In this fantasy world , constructed to impress American voters , in which failures were sold as successes , it was impossible to devise sensible policies .
The U.S. occupation has destabilized Iraq and the Middle East .
Stability will not return until the occupation has ended .
The Iraqi government , penned into the Green Zone , has become tainted in the eyes of Iraqis by reliance on a foreign power .
Even when it tries to be independent , it seldom escapes the culture of dependency in which its members live .
Much of what has gone wrong has more to do with the U.S. than Iraq .
The weaknesses of its government and army have been exposed .
Iraq has joined the list of small wars  as France found in Algeria in the 1950s and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s  that inflict extraordinary damage on their occupiers .

Julie Amero , the substitute teacher convicted of four felony counts when a computer in her classroom subjected seventh - graders to pornographic images , has been granted a new trial in light of fresh forensic information that came to light following her first trial .
Amero faced up to 40 years in prison for the offense , which stemmed from an incident in October of 2004 while she was teaching at a middle school in Norwich , Connecticut .
What seems undisputed is that a computer in the class room displayed a series of pornographic images , including one of a couple engaged in oral sex .
Less clear is how the event came to be .
Prosecutors argued Amero had actively caused the computer to display the images and argued her actions resulted in felony risk or injury to a minor .
Court rules prevented Amero 's defense team from presenting testimony that could have shown the computer was infected with malware that forced the computer to display pop-ups .
Amero 's conviction became a cause celebre for bloggers and information security professionals all over the world .
They argued , rather convincingly , that the malware epidemic - and public officials ' frequent obliviousness to it - were responsible for one of the more spectacular breakdowns in American justice this decade .
Following Amero's January conviction , a team of pro-bono researchers set out to analyze the contents of the PC which was running Windows 98 SE , an operating system with notoriously weak security .
In setting aside the conviction on Wednesday , Superior Court Judge Hillary B. Strackbein ruled that the prosecution 's expert computer witness , a Norwich police detective , provided " erroneous " testimony about the classroom computer , according to an article in the Hartford Courant .
She cited a forensic computer analysis conducted after the trial by the state police crime lab , which she said " contradicts testimony of the state 's computer witness . "
At Wednesday 's hearing , Assistant State Attorney David Smith - who during the trial argued the evidence was " clear cut " that Amero had caused the pornography to appear on the computer - acknowledged that erroneous information concerning the computer was presented to the jury .
He said the state would take no position on Amero 's motion for a new trial , an indication she will not be tried again .
" A great weight has been lifted off my back , " a tearful Amero , 40 , said following the ruling . ®
Studio bosses have given early approval for two sequels to the Transformers remake due out in July .
Director Michael Bay has also told how his version of the 1980s cartoon classic is heavy on the special effects and has cost some Â£ 50 million .
A trailer of the movie , to be released next month after several delays , is said to demonstrate impressive CGI as the Autobots go head - to - head in battle with the Decepticons .
Bay said he thought the combination of human actors and heavy effects had paid off .
" It 's got a lot of action , but at the same time it 's very funny and it's got heart , " he explained .
" I only wanted to do Transformers if I could do it realistically . "
Meanwhile , the DreamWorks studio has given the provisional go - ahead for two more movies .

These are the new language features that I found being talked about ;
Better Type Inferencing including the use of “ var ’ key word which macro-ishly rewrites to the type of object you assign to it .
This is also the case with Arrays which now do not need explicit type declarations var x = 42 ; var arr = new [ ]
{
“ This ” , “ is ” , “ a ” , “ string ” , “ array ” } ;
Keyword Arguments in Constructors new Point( X = 3 , Y = 4 ) X , and Y have a syntax to declare them similar to public accessors // Due to Better Type inferencing we can elide Point
var r = new Rectangle {
P1 = { X = 0 , Y = 1 } ,
P2 = { X = 2 , Y = 3 }
} ;
Seems to have anonymous types / classes with an easy syntax var x = new ( X = 3 , Y = 4 ) var p1 = new { Name = " Lawnmower " , Price = 495.00 } ;
var p2 = new { Name = " Shovel " , Price = 26.95 } ;
p1 = p2 ; // These are of the same anonymous type
Opening base classes to provide functionality ( a bit , you still cannot get to non public members on that class . ) namespace Extender {
public static class XMLUtil {
public static string ToXML ( this Point pt ) {
// stuff
}
}
}
Notice that our first parameter must be a type definition for the object we are wanting to extend .
Lambda expressions which in C# 3.0 seem to be mostly better syntax for anonymous delegates with outer variable capture ( sic ) .
For some reason they thought that the ADwOVC were a little verbose for the task at hand , and were not quite enough like LISP lambdas .
x => x + 1 // Implicitly typed , expression body x => { return x + 1 ; } // Implicitly typed , statement body ( int x ) => x + 1 // Explicitly typed , expression body ( int x ) => { return x + 1 ; } // Explicitly typed , statement body ( x , y ) => x * y // Multiple parameters ( ) => Console . WriteLine ( ) // No parameters ( Yay Thunk ! )
Query Expression / LINQ : This is a big , so I am only going to cover it briefly .
The goal of this is to allow set processing language in your C# program .
It will convert a “ Query Expression ” into a series of function calls that will operate on a set of data .
There is a ton more information about this out on the web if it piques your interest .
from c in customers
from o in c.
Orders
orderby o. Total descending
select new { c.
Name , o. OrderID , o. Total }
from c in customers
join o in orders on c.CustomerID equals o. CustomerID
join d in details on o.
OrderID equals d. OrderID
join p in products on d.ProductID equals p.ProductID
select new { c.
Name , o. OrderDate , p.ProductName }
Expression Trees ( from the spec ) : permit lambda expressions to be represented as data structures instead of executable code .
Expression trees are efficient in - memory data representations of lambda expressions and make the structure of the expression transparent and explicit .
While this certainly sounds interesting I wish they would have spent more than a paragraph on it in the language spec .
My guess is that this is mostly in there to support what LINQ is doing more than that this was intended for end user use much .
It is possible though that this would allow for macros expressed as operations on an Expression Tree .
It also seems to backdoor in runtime evaluation .
The final result is that C# 3 is still static all over the damn place , but hey … they are working on it .
Maybe version 4 will have a regular old eval function ( hehehe )

It ’s been 18 years since I joined Volvo , a Swedish company .
Working for them has proven to be an interesting experience .
Any project here takes 2 years to be finalized , even if the idea is simple and brilliant .
It ’s a rule .
Globalized processes have caused in us ( all over the world ) a general sense of searching for immediate results .
Therefore , we have come to posses a need to see immediate results .
This contrasts greatly with the slow movements of the Swedish .
They , on the other hand , debate , debate , debate , hold x quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme .
At the end , this always yields better results .
Said in another words :
1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo , a state in Brazil .
2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants .
3. Stockholm , has 500,000 people .
4. Volvo , Escania , Ericsson , Electrolux , Nokia are some of its renowned companies .
Volvo supplies the NASA .
The first time I was in Sweden , one of my colleagues picked me up at the hotel every morning .
It was September , bit cold and snowy .
We would arrive early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance ( 2000 employees drive their car to work ) .
The first day , I did n’t say anything , either the second or third .
One morning I asked , “ Do you have a fixed parking space ?
I ’ve noticed we park far from the entrance even when there are no other cars in the lot . ”
To which he replied , “ Since we ’re here early we ’ll have time to walk , and whoever gets in late will be late and need a place closer to the door .
Do n’t you think ?
Imagine my face .
Nowadays , there ’s a movement in Europe name Slow Food .
This movement establishes that people should eat and drink slowly , with enough time to taste their food , spend time with the family , friends , without rushing .
Slow Food is against its counterpart : the spirit of Fast Food and what it stands for as a lifestyle .
Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement called Slow Europe , as mentioned by Business Week .
Basically , the movement questions the sense of “ hurry ” and “ craziness ” generated by globalization , fueled by the desire of “ having in quantity ” ( life status ) versus “ having with quality ” , “ life quality ” or the “ quality of being ” .
French people , even though they work 35 hours per week , are more productive than Americans or British .
Germans have established 28.8 hour workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20 % .
This slow attitude has brought forth the US ’s attention , pupils of the fast and the “ do it now ! ” .
This no-rush attitude does n’t represent doing less or having a lower productivity .
It means working and doing things with greater quality , productivity , perfection , with attention to detail and less stress .
It means reestablishing family values , friends , free and leisure time .
Taking the “ now ” , present and concrete , versus the “ global ” , undefined and anonymous .
It means taking humans ’ essential values , the simplicity of living .
It stands for a less coercive work environment , more happy , lighter and more productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to do .
It ’s time to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious quality with no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products and services , without losing the essence of spirit .
In the movie , Scent of a Woman , there ’s a scene where Al Pacino asks a girl to dance and she replies , “ I can ’t , my boyfriend will be here any minute now ” .
To which Al responds , “ A life is lived in an instant ” .
Then they dance to a tango .
Many of us live our lives running behind time , but we only reach it when we die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on time .
Others are so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the present , which is the only time that truly exists .
We all have equal time throughout the world .
No one has more or less .
The difference lies in how each one of us does with our time .
We need to live each moment .
As John Lennon said , “ Life is what happens to you while you ’re busy making other plans ” .
Congratulations for reading till the end of this message .
There are many who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this globalized world .
An attempt last Saturday by a Uganda man to recycle an unexploded artillery shell ended rather badly when he ill - advisedly decided to melt it down for scrap , Reuters reports .
Francis Agwoka , acting police chief for the " once war - ravaged eastern Teso region " , pretty well summed it up when he told the news agency : " We understand this man picked up a shell and tried to melt it for scrap .
He put it in the fire and it exploded . "
Agwoka added : " Two people were killed and seven others rushed to hospital critically injured .
We are sealing off the area to look for more bombs . "
The Teso region is awash with " mines and abandoned ammunition " , Reuters notes , following a 2003 attack on the area by the Lord 's Resistance Army rebels as part of a 20 - year insurgency which has " killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly two million " .
Accordingly , and following the recycling mishap , police have warned locals " not to touch unfamiliar metal objects " . ®

Winnyを媒介して悲惨なプライバシー流出事故が続いているのは、言うまでもなく、自然現象なのではなく、ウイルスを作成し頒布している者が企図するところによるものである。いったいどういう人が何の目的で作成し頒布しているかということは、憶測にしかなりようがないので、あまり多く語られることはないが、よく耳にする陰謀論的な説としては、(1)著作権侵害行為をやめさせたいと考えている者が、Winnyの利用を危険なものにするためにやっているという説、(2)ウイルス対策や流出対策の事業者の関係者が、事業の需要を創出するためにやっているという説（これは、Winny媒介ウイルスに限らず昔のウイルスのころから語られていたもの）などがある。
私の憶測では、少なくとも初期のキンタマウイルスは、単純に愉快犯だったのだろうと思う。論座2006年5月号では私は次のように述べていた。
「 最新のウイルス対策ソフトを導入していれば大丈夫」というのは間違い。対策ソフトを常に更新していても、対応できないウイルスはある。ウィニーユーザーを標的にした日本独特のウイルスへの外資系の対策ソフトの対応は、どうしても後手に回らざるをえない。裏を返せば、「国産ウイルス対策技術の不在」という構造的な問題がある。ウイルスが早くから猛威を振るった英語圏では、ウイルス対策がかなり普及した。しかし日本では、「ウイルスをばらまく愉快犯は子どもっぽい」という文化的風潮があり、ウイルス発生が比較的少なかった。その結果、対策技術がビジネスとして育たなかったものと思われる。
ところが、日本でも情報暴露型のような「冷酷」なウイルスが増えている。当初は、非難の矛先がウイルス作者ではなくウィニーユーザーに向けられ、違法ファイルを欲しがる者は被害にあっても自業自得とされた。ずさんな情報管理の実態を暴いたとして、ウイルスがヒーロー扱いされる風潮さえある。しかし、悪質なプログラムを流布している者の責任は当然、問わなければならない。 最近の「ウイルス製造」には、高度な技術は必要ない。「ウィニーのアップロードフォルダにパソコン内のファイルをコピーする」というわずか１行のプログラムが情報流出を引き起こす。ウイルスは自己複製機能がないと大規模に広がらないが、ウィニー自体がウイルスの複製機能の役割を果たしてくれる。
ウイルス作成者を罰する立法の動きは、すでにある。今国会に提出されている刑法改正案には「不正指令電磁的記録等作成等の罪」、いわゆる「ウイルス作成罪」が盛り込まれている。（以下略） ウィニー騒動の本質 あまりにも情報流出のリスクが大きい , 論座 2006年5 月号
国内のウイルス被害に対する世論を見ていると、被害者に落ち度があると被害者に同情しないという傾向が、日本社会にはあるように感じられる（他の要因があってもそっちが軽視されてしまう傾向）。「喧嘩両成敗」あるいは「どっちもどっち」的な判断保留態度の文化が、個々の状況に関係なく単に思考停止の道具として使われているためかもしれない。キンタマ系ウイルスは、そうした日本の文化に根ざすよう作られていると思えた。自己顕示だけを目的とした愉快犯、例えば典型的なWebページ改竄の「○○参上」のような落書きは、日本では嘲笑の的になることは皆が知っており、そういう輩は現れない。一方、「悪いことをしている人だけが被害に遭う」ようにしておけば、作成して頒布した者への非難が避けられてしまう。キンタマウイルスの頒布者らはそれを承知でやっているのだろう。
しかし、キンタマウイルスの威力がもはや実証済みとなったこの2年ほどは、頒布者らの動機は別のものに移ってきているのではないだろうか。コンセプト実証としての目新しさはない。今行われていることは、漏洩事故が継続して起きるよう、キンタマウイルスの効力を維持していく小さな改良だ。そのような地味な活動を継続させている動機は何なのか。
陰謀論の基本に立ち返れば、「儲かったのは誰か？」ということになる。
キンタマウイルスの被害で金銭的利益をあげたといえば、マスコミではないだろうか。連日繰り返し報道される流出事故。次から次へと見つかる事故にネタに事欠くことがなかった新聞社もあっただろう。夕刊紙にいたっては、若い女性のプライベート写真が流出すると、何の落ち度もない一般人であるにもかかわらず、目と性器だけ隠して裸体写真を掲載することまでした。
彼らはどうやって事実確認用のデータを入手していたのか。専門の取材班を結成して日夜Winnyでキンタマを集めていたと噂する説もあれば、自分の手は汚さないよう外部の協力者に依頼して集めさせていたという憶測レベルの噂も耳にする。さすがに、新聞社自身がウイルスを作ったり頒布するなどという行為は行っていなかったに違いないが、「外部の協力者」はどうだろうか？
そうした疑念を強める記事が今頃になって日経ビジネスに掲載された。
ウィニーこそ史上最強の 「 ジャーナリスト」？ , タケダジャーナル 〜武田徹とネットとメディア , 日経ビジネスオンライン , 2007 年5月31 日
このジャーナリストは次のように言っている。
ファイル交換ソフ ト 「 Winny（以下ウィニー）」がウィルスに感染、至るところでPCのハードディスク内の情報をネットにばらまき始めたニュースは印象深かった。 （略） しかし私自身の印象は、怯えや焦りとは相当に隔たっていた。そうか、ウィニーはもはやジャーナリズムになったのだな――。そんなことを私は考えていたのだった。 （中略） （略）結果としてウィルス感染によってパソコンの持ち主の意志を越えてハードディスクからデータを垂れ流し始めたことを「歴史の偶然」として片付けるべきではない。そんなことが可能な既に技術が用意されている。それはジャーナリズムにおいて言えば、ウィニーのようなプログラムですらジャーナリストの活動ができてしまう時代が到来したということだ。
（略）その中に政治家や官僚の接待記録や、防衛関係や警察の内部資料あたりが含まれていて、それが首尾良く報道関係者に見つけられれば価値を発揮するが、流出情報の殆どは市井の人々の個人情報だろう。
だが、その種の情報の価値も軽視すべきではない。（略）個人情報をうまく扱える人間の手に渡れば、それは千金の価値を帯びるようになる。ジャーナリズムにおいても事情は変わらない。流出情報がどんな価値を持つかは、受け手側次第なのだ。 （中略） （略）対してブログの書き手の場合、以前に大手のマスメディアで仕事をしていたことをプロフィールに書けるブロガーを除いて、素姓がいまひとつ不確かなひとが多い。（略）公的なテーマを扱いながらも、所詮は「独り言」のように扱われてしまう。
しかし、ここでも状況は一変しうる。たとえばウィニーによってブログの設置者関連の個人情報が流出したとしよう。それと組み合わせられると、ブログに書かれていた「独り言」が俄然、意味を持って輝き始める。あるいは課金支払いのために登録したクレジットカードの名義などからブロガーのリアルな情報が明らかになると、その見たこと聞いたことが確かな事実の報告として信頼されるようになる。特にそれまでは匿名で、ごく身近な知人にだけ分かる形でブログに書かれていた私的な内容が、いつ、どこで、誰によって、どのように書かれたかが分かるようになり、確かな事実として利用できるようになる。こうして別の個人情報と接続されることで、事実の「表情」が変わってしまうのだ。
（略）個人ブログ百花繚乱の日本のネット状況は、そうしたシステムが、社会の隅々にまで毛細血管のように張り巡らされていることを意味する。今まではそれをジャーナリズムのメディアとして利用することはできなかったが、たとえばウィニーのようなソフトの関与ひとつで状況は劇的に変わる。 僅かな楔を打ち込むだけで、既存ジャーナリズムに属するプロフェッショナルたちの「人間的」な頑張りなどなくても、ジャーナリズムが調べて報じるべきだった情報が手に入ってしまう――。そんなことが可能となる時代の入口のすぐ近くにまで私たちは来ているのだ。 （中略） （略）備えた新しいアームチェア・ノンフィクション、いわばハードディスク・ジャーナリズムが求められているのだろう。
そんなジャーナリズムだけが、ウィニーが作られてしまった時代に自らをジャーナリズムと自称できるのではないか。

「 僅かな楔を打ち込むだけで」――すなわち、小さなプログラム
をトロイの木馬（ウイルス）として送り込むだけで、誰の秘密でも引き出せる。それが、「千金の価値を帯びる」と、このジャーナリストは言っている。しかも、ターゲットは一般人の「私的な内容」だという。
何が本題か知らないが、このジャーナリストは、「僅かな楔を打ち込むだけで一般人の私的な内容を千金の価値にできる」という手法について、否定していない。否定する表現が一切書かれていない
。これが倫理に反する行為であることをこのジャーナリストは素で知らないのではないか。もし、「キンタマウイルスを作成し頒布しているのはあなたでしょう？」と問いかければ、憤慨するどころか、褒められたと勘違いして「いえいえ私にそんなプログラム力はありません」とニコニコするのではないか。
馬鹿は死ねと言いたい。
マスコミの委託を受けてか知らないが、キンタマコレクターと呼ばれる人たちがいる。ネットエージェントの杉浦社長も言っていることだが、私も自作のNyzillaを使って何箇所ものWinnyノードを観測した際に、ウイルス入りのキンタマファイルばかりを送信可能化しているノードが存在するのを見た。
これは、 「キンタマ」などの文字列をキーワードに全ファイルを自動ダウンロードする設定
にしているノードだろう。この設定をしていると、流出ファイルを延々とダウンロードし収集し続ける。これがキンタマコレクターの仕事であるわけだが、通常のWinnyを使ってこれを行うと、それは同時に、キンタマファイルを公衆送信可能化する（他人に提供する状態にする）ことにもなる。コレクター達は、それも承知でやっているだろう。
そしてキンタマファイルにはウイルスも入っているのだから、キンタマコレクター達のキンタマ公衆送信は、ウイルス頒布に他ならない。
もし、国会で審議中の刑法改正案が成立し施行されれば、不正指令電磁的記録供用罪（第十九章の二第2項）で、三年以下の懲役又は五十万円以下の罰金だ。しかも、供用が確認されなくても、「前項の罪の未遂は罰する」とあるので、供用するつもりで送信可能化しただけで同未遂罪となる。
「 ジャーナリスト 」 が 「僅かな楔を打ち込むだけで一般人の私的な内容を千金の価値にできる」という手法を望むなら、その委託先の協力者達はこぞってウイルスの拡散を望むだろう。それは、地引きでダウンロードし続けるWinnyを24時間稼動させ続けるだけでできる。
現行法ではこれを処罰する手立てがないらしいと耳にする。合法なら何でもやるというのがジャーナリストなのか。倫理などというものは一つの価値観でしかないとでも言うのか。国会の議事録を確認してみると、不正指令電磁的記録供用罪について野党からも反対意見は出ていないのであり、上記のようなウイルスを頒布する行為が人の道を踏み外した行為であることは、既に合意されているといってよい。
そもそも 、Winny経由での情報漏洩事故はもう3年以上続いていて状況に変化はないわけだが、このジャーナリストのような発言をする人はこれまでに居なかった。なぜ今頃になってこのような発言が新しいものとして出てくるのか。
もちろん 、Winnyネットワークへの情報漏洩が起きている事実を市民に広く伝えるのは、報道機関の使命であろう。初期の漏洩のころからその報道に携わってきた真面目な記者を私は知っている。そこには常に葛藤があったはずだ。報道しないわけにはいかないが、ファイルを入手する作業自体が問題を含んでいた。
このよう なWinnyの仕組みは、設計段階から意図されたものだろう。つまり、いかがわしい行為の事実を掴もうと、いかがわしくない者が中に入ってこようとしても、いかがわしい行為をしなければ、いかがわしい行為の事実を掴めないように設計されているわけだ。
これが、2002年までの単純な情報漏洩事故の報道とは異なる、Winny流出の報道の新たな難しさであり、昔から情報漏洩問題に取り組んできたメディア記者らは、そのことをきちんと理解していただろう。
愛媛県警の流出事故で Nシステムの実態等が明るみになった際には、「自動化されたジャーナリスト」のような声は（雑談としては面白いので）あちこちで会話されていただろう
が、それをプロの記者が真顔で語ることはなかった。不謹慎だからだ。下品さで知られるボーガスニュースでギャグにされていたくらいの話だ。
ところが、何年も経つうちに世の中が少しずつ変わってきた。パソコンが普及し、Winnyが普及し、新たな初心者市民が被害に巻き込まれるようになったのと同時に、かつては情報セキュリティ問題に関心のなかったような新たな「ジャーナリスト」が参入してきた。
その結果起きた現象のひとつが、先月の「北海道新聞の記者がWinnyを使って流出ファイルを入手したことを公言しているが自分のやっていることがわかっているのか」の事例であり、もうひとつが、この日経ビジネスの「ウィニーこそ史上最強の「ジャーナリスト」？」だろう。
なにかもう末期的な危うさを感じる。どうにかならないものか。
3月にも、田原総一朗と高野孟がこんなことを言っている。
この調子でサンデープロジェクトで番組作りされるようなことにでもなれば、新たな「新参者」が次から次へと湧いてくるだろう。

The fresco is a detail from this much larger painting
Enlarge Image
A fresco painting by a Renaissance master which once decorated the bedroom of Pope Alexander VI in the Vatican has gone on show in Rome .
A leading Italian art historian and curator says he has documentary proof that it was once part of a much larger painting depicting the aged Pope kneeling in front of his youthful mistress , Giulia Farnese .
This is an unusual example of " damnatio memoriae " - a Latin phrase meaning " damnation of memory " .
It refers to a custom dating back to antiquity - the attempted removal of a famous person from the historical record for reasons of dishonour .
Roman emperors used to order the destruction or removal of portraits or statues of disgraced members of their family .
Debauched lifestyle
Pope Alexander VI , the notorious Borgia Pope from Spain , discredited the Church by his debauched lifestyle .
He fathered seven children , including Lucrezia and Cesare Borgia , by at least two mistresses .
The painting is an exquisite portrait of Jesus
Such was Alexander VI 's unpopularity that when he died - perhaps by poisoning , perhaps from the plague - in 1503 at the age of 72 , the priests of St Peter 's Basilica at first refused to accept his body for burial .
Pope Alexander 's portrait , commissioned from Pinturicchio to decorate the papal bedchamber inside the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican , was later hacked away from the wall , most likely during the 17th Century , and was believed lost until very recently .
The painting showed Alexander kneeling in front of the Child Jesus and the Virgin Mary , whose face , according to documentary evidence from several contemporary sources , was that of one of his mistresses , a handsome young Roman noblewoman called Giulia Farnese .
The small segment of this much larger original fresco painting now on display is an exquisite portrait of the child Jesus .
The child has a halo of pure gold painted around his head .
This extraordinarily fine painting came onto the international art market three years ago and was bought by an Italian industrialist from Perugia .
Mystery hands
There are five hands shown on the painting .
Professor Franco Nuccirelli from Perugia , the curator of the exhibition , who rediscovered the painting , told me he believes that two of the hands belong to the missing figure of the Virgin Mary , who clasps the child gently around his waist .
The child has one hand raised in a blessing and holds a golden orb surmounted by a cross in the other .
One of Pope Alexander VI 's children was the notorious Lucrezia Borgia
The fifth hand , according to Prof Nuccirelli , is that of the missing figure of Pope Alexander himself .
His hand gently fondles the child 's right foot .
We know exactly what the picture in the Pope 's bedroom looked like .
It was copied by a 17th - Century artist called Pietro Facchetti while still in situ .
This copy is now in the possession of another Roman noble family .
Prof Nucciarelli's proof that this fragment belongs to the lost masterpiece of Pinturicchio looks very convincing .
The famous art historian and scholar Giorgio Vasari , writing in the second edition of his Lives of the Artists in 1568 , mentioned that Pinturicchio 's painting was " over the door of a room in the Apostolic Palace " .
It was , said Vasari , " a portrait of Signora Giulia Farnese with the countenance of Our Lady , and in the same picture the head of Pope Alexander adoring her " .
Frustratingly , there is only one surviving portrait of Giulia Farnese , whose brother Alessandro Farnese later became Pope Paul III .
The portrait is in the Museum of the Castel Sant 'Angelo in Rome , where it is attributed to the Roman painter Luca Longhi .
It shows a young woman rather wistfully seated in a mountain landscape next to a unicorn - the fabled beast is one of the heraldic emblems of the Farnese family .
Naturally [ the Vatican ] are not very happy about publicity of this sort
Professor Nucciarelli
I asked Prof Nucciarelli what had been the reaction from the Vatican to his discoveries .
" Naturally they are not very happy about publicity of this sort , " he said .
" But we have been in Alexander 's bedroom , which is one of the clearly identifiable rooms in the Borgia apartment of the Apostolic Palace .
" There is exactly the right space above the door where the painting would have fitted .
But so far we have not received permission to examine the present state of the wall which is hidden by a tapestry . "
First mistress
Pope Alexander VI 's first and best known mistress was called Vanozza dei Cattanei .
She was the mother of Lucrezia and Cesare Borgia and several portraits of her are in existence .
The one surviving portrait of Giulia Farnese shows her with a unicorn
You can see her tomb and a portrait bust in a rather dark side chapel inside the church of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome .
After visiting the exhibition I went back to view her portrait which I had not looked at for some years .
Decidedly matronly , I thought .
Vanozza had three husbands in addition to her relationship with Pope Alexander , by whom she bore four children altogether .
The nice thing about living in Rome is that most events here are historically well - documented .
You can walk into any church to check the facts .
In Rome you actually touch history every day by simply walking down the street .
Early this year I did a lot of travel , so my writing ground a complete halt .
I got back home a few weeks ago , hoping to get a lot of writing done .
Well I 've done some , but things keep coming up to keep me away : surgery to remove the pins from the accident , being Flooded .
But the big productivity killer has been self inflicted - buying a new computer .
This new setup , particularly going dual head , meant another question - how to co-exist multiple operating systems .
I used to have the old desktop and the D600 hooked up with a kvm switch .
That worked well as I could easily switch between Ubuntu and Windows depending on what I wanted to do .
Kvm switching with dual heads sounded messy .
However listening to the folks in our London office extol virtualization decided me on another option .
Their view was that it was better to have Linux be the host and have windows run virtual .
That suits me as I prefer the Linux 's virtual desktop capabilities .
( Windows has a virtual desktop manager in its PowerToys which is worth having , but not as good as what comes with most X window managers .
When I buy a new desktop , I usually do n't get a new monitor - as these last much longer than computers .
However it was time for something new .
One of my favorite answers to ' how do we improve our development productivity ' is to tell them to buy larger monitors than they think they need .
Screen real estate makes a huge difference to productivity , whether you are programming or writing .
My old setup , a 21 " CRT , used to be pretty good but now I wanted more .
So I went for two Samsung SyncMaster 204B 20 " LCD monitors .
Actually I did n't follow the hot rod exactly .
Ars guides tend to focus on gamers , and I do n't do computer games .
So I decided to downgrade a good way on the video output , choosing the ATI X800GTO they picked for the budget box .
I also did n't bother with sound , relying just on what was on the motherboard - music is handled by a Squeezebox .
I did upgrade on the hard drive , adding their suggested 10,000rpm WD Raptor .
I rather like building my own desktop machines , that way I get to choose and know exactly what goes in it .
The pain with this is knowing exactly which combination of components will work well together .
As it turns out I quite often read Ars Technica and they regularly put out a system guide which provides a handy configuration .
So I decided to follow their guide for April 2006 and build the " HotRod " .
My old setup was a desktop machine running Ubuntu , a company Dell D600 running Windows , and my PowerMac .
Since the D600 is such a brick I hardly ever traveled with it , relying on the Mac .
All of these bits of kit are about two years old , which is my threshold for getting something new .
ThoughtWorks replaced the D600 - brick with a really nice Dell X1 ( small , and 2.5 lb light ) which will replace the Mac for travel .
( I like Macs , but 5 lb is too much . )
So it was up to me to figure out what to do about the desktop .
The Brutal Reality
So that was the plan - the next question is how are things working out ( just in case anyone else fancies something similar . )
Putting the hardware together was easy - just took me a couple of hours .
I booted up using a live Linux CD ( Damn Small Linux as that was closest ) and everything seemed to be working .
My first step was to install windows on one partition .
Even though I 'd intended to run Windows virtually , I was n't convinced that this idea would work out best for me - and maybe someday I would want to do something with fancy graphics .
This was n't completely straightforward as the network and video would n't work properly with a straight install - but that was easily fixed by adding drivers for the motherboard ( network ) and video .
Windows usually just works with video , so the fact that this card needed a little extra work worried me - because X can be much more ugly .
This was confirmed as I installed and then tried to boot Ubuntu Breezy - X failed to start .
This is my big nightmare with Unix desktops - configuring X is one of the worse installation experiences you can go through .
Even when you use a ' user - friendly ' X installer , it proceeds to ask you " Would you like crypto - blue covariance adaptation ? " ( or something equally meaningful to me ) and I have to guess an answer and hope my fumbling does n't fry my new and expensive monitor .
Googling is the only solution here and eventually I found this Ubuntu wiki page which told me to install some additional packages .
Well package installation in Ubuntu is a breeze :
sudo apt - get install xorg - driver - fglrx sudo dpkg - reconfigure xserver - xorg
I crossed my fingers and selected the suggested default for everything except picking fglrx as the web page told me .
X still did n't start but the web page told me about the error ( duplicate symbol rol_long ' ) and how to fix it .
I followed instructions and X burst into life .
( It was n't still quite right however .
Running fglrxinfo told me it was n't using the right drivers to get accelerated 3D - but that was fine for me , I 'm mostly in a 2D world . )
Or more precisely it burst into half - life .
I did all this with only one monitor - I like to do things one step at a time .
Again it needed some googling to find out what to do - no nice control panel like there was on Windows ( let alone the Mac where I ran dual - head over a decade ago . )
The first thing to decide is what kind of dual head to use .
X has long been able to run multiple monitors - but not in the same way as Windows / Mac does it .
The classic X way is to have separate X sessions on each monitor .
The problem with this is that they are utterly separate , you can't drag a window from one monitor to another .
Also any programs operating in both have to run separate instances ( which means different firefox profiles etc ) .
The advantage of this approach , however , is that you get separate virtual desktops for each .
All in all I decided I was happy ( for the moment ) with classic X - an alternative is to use Xinerama , but I 'll look into that another time .
I tried to use fglrx - control to set up the dual monitors .
No dice - I could set it for dual head , but it just forgot each time .
In the end fglrxconfig helped me do the trick .
Next step was to try out VMWare .
I downloaded VMWare Server from the web site ( currently a free beta - if I like it I 'll pay up when it releases . )
It was n't easy to get going - at times like this I really miss apt .
I ran the installer script and it ran into problems with dependencies .
I needed the following
sudo apt - get install make sudo apt - get install gcc - 3.4 sudo apt - get install linux - headers - amd64 - generic
Once I did that VMWare installed just fine .
I installed Windows , Visual Studio , Visio and other odds and ends .
Everything seems to run just fine .
However all has not been well on the host .
I would work for several hours happily then suddenly the screen would go black on my primary monitor ( Screen 0 in X - speak ) .
The monitor lost the signal completely .
I eventually realized I could get it back by typing ctrl - alt - f5 to get a virtual console , which would appear on both screens , and then ctrl - alt - f7 to go back to X. Annoying .
But really bad when I typed ctrl - alt - f5 and both monitors lost the signal .
This left me stuck - even logging in from another machine and restarting X would n't bring them back - I had to reboot .
I put up with this for a while , but it got too annoying .
So I decided that maybe I should go to Dapper Drake .
Dapper is the next version of Ubuntu , still in beta but supposedly pretty stable .
Maybe this would help , if nothing else it would allow me to use apt to install Java .
The install went very smoothly :
gksudo " update - manager - d "
I soon realized that the upgrade gave me the correct ATI drivers .
( I 'd wondered if the video drivers were part of the problem . )
I also got ugly orange icons and an upgraded firefox .
The bad news was some other problems I ran into .
The really bad one was that xemacs stopped working - a big deal as I use it a lot .
The problem is something to do with finding colors - see this discussion thread for more information and how I solved it .
The other problem is still with me - the machine wo n't shutdown .
If I try shutting it down ( by any route ) the screens go black , the shutdown sound stops in mid squawk and everything just hangs .
I have to turn it off at the mains .
The good news is that I have n't had a black screen moment since the Dapper install .
COCHIN , India - A few minutes before 7 on a recent morning , Greeshma Salin swiveled her chair to face the computer , slipped on her headset and said in faintly accented English , " Hello , Daniela . "
Seconds later she heard the response , " Hello , Greeshma . "
The two chatted excitedly before Ms. Salin said , " We 'll work on pronouns today . "
Then she typed in , " Daniela thinks that Daniela should give Daniela 's horse Scarlett to Daniela 's sister . "
" Is this an awkward sentence ? " she asked .
" How can you make it better ? "
Nothing unusual about this exchange except that Ms. Salin , 22 , was in Cochin , a city in coastal southern India , and her student , Daniela Marinaro , 13 , was at her home in Malibu , Calif .
Ms. Salin is part of a new wave of outsourcing to India : the tutoring of American students .
Twice a week for a month now , Ms. Salin , who grew up speaking the Indian language Malayalam at home , has been tutoring Daniela in English grammar , comprehension and writing .

In Praise of C and C ++
By Pete McBreen
Date : Jul 19 , 2002
Article is provided courtesy of Addison Wesley .
Return to the article
See why many developers prefer C and C++ over other rapid development tools .
C and C++ enable developers to create long - lived predictable applications and to interface to legacy code on practically any platform .
Introduction
While Java and C# have been receiving all of the publicity of late , a lot of software is still being written in C and C ++.
Indeed , many traditional languages such as COBOL , FORTRAN , and Ada are still in widespread use .
Although I harbor a certain fondness for COBOL , and have written more Java code over the past five years than is probably good for me , I 'm finding more and more that I 'm drawn back to C and C ++.
I 'm coming back to C and C++ in part because I prefer stable development environments , and because I 've come to appreciate the power of object - oriented scripting languages , particularly Ruby .
Ruby is evolving rapidly , but then I do n't try to write really long - lived code in a scripting language .
I use scripting languages for code that I want to be able to write rapidly , to test ideas or to implement some valuable functionality quickly .
For applications that have to last a long time , I prefer to use C and C ++.
Java is kind of neat in some ways , but it has been a moving target .
Just as you get an application working with one set of class libraries , the rest of the Java community adopts a different implementation as the " standard " at least for the next year or so .
And to add to the fun , there are always the rumors about Java being radically changed by the addition of templates , something that would drastically alter the class libraries yet again .
Taking the Long View
I might be a heretic , but I 'm coming to realize that while the bleeding edge of technology might be good for my résumé , for most business applications it 's actually counterproductive .
For the types of applications I 've worked on over the years management information systems , manufacturing systems , finance applications , middleware , and e-commerce appsbleeding edge is not important .
What really matters is rock solid , maintainable software that can be used reliably 24 hours a day , 365 days a year .
Most of these applications required a large investment of time and money , with the intention that the new system would continue to evolve and improve for many years before needing replacement .
With C and C++ , it 's easy to encapsulate dependencies on specific operating systems or components so that the application can be ported to new operating systems , databases , messaging subsystems , or GUI libraries .
True , the port can sometimes be quite expensive , but it 's always cheaper than rewriting the entire application , which would happen when the formerly bleeding - edge Java application is completely rewritten in C# to exploit some new GUI widget that 's available only on the .NET platform .
But What About Productivity ?
Over the years there have been many different " rapid application development " tools and technologies , and they 've been more productive environments than C and C ++.
Smalltalk , Java , and even Visual Basic are all good examples of productive application development environments .
Unfortunately , they 're also good examples of environments that , for one reason or another , have n't enabled developers to create long - lived applications .
Until these " productive " development environments mature to the point at which companies can trust them for long - lived , mission - critical applications , there will always be a role for C and C ++.
The reason is that for large applications , organizations do n't want to face the hassle of rewriting an application every four or five years .
After all , many organizations have mainframe applications that have lasted for 25 years or more , so why should they be forced to rewrite their new applications so soon ?
Productivity Comes from Reuse
One difference in productivity among the various programming languages is the capabilities of the libraries that are part of the development environment .
Developers are productive when using Java because of the size of the JDK class libraries .
The same thing is true for Smalltalk and Visual Basic .
It 's not so much the language that 's productive it 's all of the bundled libraries .
Once developers have learned the libraries that come with a language , they can be extraordinarily productive compared with writing a traditional 3GL .
But guess what ?
Interesting though this comparison may be , it 's misleading .
Teams that use C and C++ have a massive range of code libraries available for them to use ; they 're just not always packaged as neatly as the JDK or the new .NET framework .
Teams that understand the benefits of reuse are productive in any language .
They may start off a bit slower while the library of useful code is built up , but over time they stand to benefit from a deep knowledge of the internals of their libraries .
Leveraging Legacy Code
Another benefit of C and C++ is the ease with which they can interface to legacy code on practically any platform .
This means that C and C++ applications can easily benefit from the reuse of legacy code , number - crunching routines written in FORTRAN , business logic and transactions in mainframe applications , and any code contained in platform - specific shared libraries .
This is in marked contrast to Java , where , although it 's possible to make what are known as " native calls , " very few development teams bother to do it .
It 's just so much easier for the team to rewrite everything in Java .
So much for it being a productive environment .
Smalltalk and Visual Basic , on the other hand , suffer from the limitation of being available only on a limited set of platforms , so forget about invoking transactions on that RPG application running on an IBM AS / 400 .
True , we could always use some messaging middleware such as MQ Series from our Visual Basic code to interact with the AS / 400 , but that just reemphasizes the value of C and C ++.
After all , most of the code examples for MQ Series are written in C .
Predictable Application Development
One of the really nice things about C and C++ is that they 're predictable .
It 's easy to find out what the code is doing ; you can step through the code in a debugger without having to worry what the runtime interpreter is doing " under the covers . "
This is why a lot of real - time and embedded code is still written in the more traditional languages such as C and Adabecause developers can predict how long routines will take to execute .
Most of the code libraries for C and C++ were written by developers who understand this need for predictability .
Indeed , most libraries actually ship with the source code .
This gives C and C++ developers many of the advantages of Open Source development , because many eyes have looked at the implementation of the libraries .
This in turn makes development more predictable , because there are fewer hidden " gotchas " in the libraries , and it 's rare for libraries to interact in unforeseen ways .
This is in marked contrast to the Visual Basic world , where most of the reusable code is sealed away in precompiled DLLs .
These DLLs often interact in unforeseen ways , so much so that the term DLL Hell has been used by many teams to describe the subtle interactions between the libraries .
Java treads the middle ground here , since the source for the standard JDK class libraries is available for any developer to read and review .
On the other hand , many of the add - on class libraries for Java development environments do n't come with source code .
Java also has its own version of DLL Hell the CLASSPATH .
Getting the ordering on the CLASSPATH just right has hassled more than a few developers .
What About Memory Management ?
The price of admission is that C developers ( and , to a lesser extent , C++ developers ) have to do some bookkeeping , but it 's not that big a deal .
It 's not very hard to write C and C++ applications without memory leaks ; all it takes is a little forethought .
Obviously , the presence of destructors in C++ makes it much easier to manage memory in C++ , but memory management is very easy to learn .
The Bottom Line
Having been drawn back to C and C++ by Ruby , I find it very interesting to notice that a lot of GNU and Open Source projects use C or C++ as their language of choice .
( Indeed , Ruby itself is written in C , and hence can run on practically every platform that has a C compiler . )
One of the first GNU projects was GCC , probably the most widely ported of the C and C++ compilers .
( GCC now supports other languages than just C and C ++. )
C is also the systems programming language for most variants of the UNIX operating system .
What this means for developers is that the future of C and C++ is secure for a long time .
Other languages might have nicer development environments and be marginally more productive , but for the core business logic of mission - critical applications I still prefer C and C ++.
I 'd choose other languages for the rapidly evolving parts of the application such as the user interface and the web front - end , but for the core of the application I have nothing but praise for C and C ++.
Time Saving Tuesday
A few months ago Max got me into Greasemonkey and I did n’t realize the power that it had until I really started to search for scripts .
For those unfamiliar with Greasemonkey it is an extension for Firefox that will let you add functionality to Web sites .
You can do just about anything from changing the way eBay looks all the way to using Google Maps in Flickr .
So those things are great , but how about we look for some real time savers …( the last one is my favorite )
– Digg Mirrors ( Download ) –
Many of us love to browse
Digg looking for interesting articles but sometimes it is frustrating when the site you are trying to view wo n’t load .
Most people will wait for someone to post a cached link in the comments but there is no need to wait when you can get a Greasemonkey script to do it for you .
As seen in the screenshot the script will add three buttons at the end of the article ’s title : DuggMirror , Coral Cache , and Google Cache .
That way you are bound to find out what all the hype is about .
– Greased Lightbox ( Download ) –
This script is a must for anyone that views images all of the time .
When using Greased Lightbox it will open images on top of the current page instead of opening a new page .
It is also very heavily geared towards Google Image searches , Flickr , Wikipedia , Facebook , MySpace , and deviantART .
You will find it the most useful on those sites because it will pop-up with the image instead of taking you to another site to see it .
For example , if you do a Google Image Search and click on one of the thumbnails you will see the full - size version without being taken to another page .
You can also zoom in and out using the buttons that I point to in the screenshot or you can move on to the next picture without even going back to the search results .
This script is very useful !
– Auto Login ( Download ) –
Sometimes it is a pain to hit the submit button each time Firefox fills in your password .
Would n’t it be great if it just did that automatically ?
It can !
The Auto Login script is great because it will click on the submit button for you as long as Firefox has already filled in your username and password .
If your password does n’t get filled in automatically then the script will never run…it ’s that simple .
You can recognize when the script is automatically pressing the button because it will place a purple border around it .
The downside is that it will automatically try to log you into the sites that place a default username and password into the text boxes .
I see this happen frequently in forums but you can disable Greasemonkey in a single click so it is n’t really a big deal .
– Allow Password Remembering ( Download ) –
I have written about this feature before just not as a Greasemonkey script .
There are some sites , such as Yahoo Mail , that try to prevent you from storing your password in your Web browser .
This is done by adding autocomplete = ” off ” to the form ’s HTML code .
With the autocomplete turned off the browser will not even prompt you to remember the password , but this Greasemonkey script will remove that from the code .
Not every site uses this technique to prevent passwords from being remembered but I ’m sure you ’ll find a few that it works for .
Sorry , there was n’t really a screenshot that I could take of this one .
– Inline Google Player ( Download ) –
Every now and then I come across a song that I want to listen to but I hate having to open my media player just to listen to hear it .
A few weeks ago Google started to let users listen to MP3 files in their email without ever having to leave their Inbox .
It was a great feature and I started to wish that other sites did this as well .
Soon after that Lifehacker put together this script which utilizes the Google MP3 player .
Anytime it finds that filetype it will show you the play button along with the timeline .
I do n’t use this very often but it is nice to have when I do need it .
– My Favorite … GMail Conversation Window ( Download ) –
Out of all of the scripts that I have mentioned this is the entire reason that I now use Greasemonkey .
The other scripts are useful but this is something I use several times throughout the day .
GMail conversation window allows you to right - click on an email in your GMail account and it will pop-up with the entire message .
Using this prevents me from having to navigate away from the page I ’m currently viewing which saves me a ton of time !
To make things even easier you will find some useful links at the top of the message that lets you close the window , archive the message , mark it as unread , or immediately send it to the trash .
Ahh , it even works with those really long messages because if it is too big to fit on your screen it will give you a scroll bar .
Honestly I find it so useful that I think Google should implement a similar feature so that I can use this anywhere I go .
If you use Greasemonkey only for this script it will be well worth it .
What a great way to end the list . :D
Japan has a drinking problem ... but if you 've got a thirst for adventure , it 's where you want to be .
In honor ( or in horror ) of these bizarre beverages seemingly not fit to rinse your septic tank , raise a cracked glass to the Top Ten Bizarre Japanese Soft Drinks , our first ten inductees into the Soft Drink Hell of Fame ...
Jeers !
Our rundown of the Top Ten Bizarre Japanese Soft Drinks gives a pretty good indication why most of the 1000 or so new soft drinks and beverages launched in Japan every year fail miserably .
Look on the bright side , though : they may not be good to drink , but you can't say they 're not good for a laugh .
10 ) Pepsi Ice Cucumber :
It 's lean , green and sounds obscene
When American companies introduce products tailored for foreign tastes , we often experience discomfiting culture shock .
Sort of like when Homer Simpson uses his toaster time machine to go back 10 million years , steps on a slug , and then comes back to an oddly different world .
Maybe that really did happen , and Springfield is now Tokyo !
Exhibit A : Pepsi Ice Cucumber , introduced to the Japanese soft drinks market and Pepsi vending machines on June 12th ( 2007 ) and to our Top Ten Bizarre Japanese Soft Drinks listing immediately thereafter .
Pepsi ? Good ... Cucumbers ?
Great !
Cucumber - flavored Pepsi ? DOH !!
9 ) Hot Calpis : the drink that makes you think - about NOT drinking it
Cue suave voiceover : " Next time you 're out on the town with the one you love , treat her to a cup of Hot Calpis " ... then trudge home alone after she pours it over your head .
Yes , delicious Calpis - I can't even read it without grinning - is known as Calpico in other countries ( for obvious reasons ) and is one of Japan 's most popular and enduring soft drinks .
Milk - based with a sweet yogurt taste , Calpis comes in original and a variety of fruit flavors .
Some drink vending machines offer this bizarre beverage hot ... steaming hot .
8 ) Coolpis :
Who would n't want to drink something with a name like Coolpis ?
Ahh , refreshing Coolpis ...
THE soft drink to offer guests - before removing their blindfolds .
Actually a Korean copy of the disturbingly named Calpis , Coolpis comes in Peach flavor and ( stop reading now , if you can ... )
Kimchee flavor .
Kimchee , for those unacquainted , is a traditional Korean dish made from fermented cabbage and LOTS of red pepper .
Makes Peach flavored Coolpis almost appealing , does n't it ?
Anyone for a Calpis vs. Coolpis taste test ?
We could call it a pis-ing contest .
7 ) Mother 's Milk : the breast - tasting drink ever !
And now , for something close to the heart ...
Mother 's Milk .
Is there anything in the world more wholesome , more natural , more life - giving than mother 's milk ?
Is there anything in the world that would make you drink it from a store bought carton ?
NO , on both counts .
If I was a baby , maybe , but not from an udder - I mean , another - mother !
I shudder to think of the scene inside one of the manufacturer 's factories ... those poor farmgirls , milkmaids or what have you , shackled up to cold , pitiless machines that never , ever stop ... and then I woke up .
6 ) Black Vinegar Juice Bar : dispenses acid trips
After chugging down a pint of Mother 's Milk , head on down to your local Black Vinegar Juice bar to give it a good curdling .
Black vinegar is noted for its health benefits ; the trouble has always been making it drinkable .
Mixing it into bizarre soft drinks with soy milk , blood orange juice or blueberry juice is supposed to solve that problem , but we remain skeptical .
At least you can splash some on the salad ( via Plastic Bamboo ) .
5 ) Speaking of which , consider Water Salad ... for what , we 're not sure ...
The creative types at Coca - Cola ( yes , THAT Coca - Cola ) who devised Water Salad are probably still shell - shocked from the New Coke and C2 soft drink fiascos and would n't risk another .. or would they ?
Water Salad is ... well ... salad - flavored water .
You know , the stuff you get after centrifuging your rinsed romaine in the salad spinner .
Funny , we pour it down the drain here ; in Japan they can it and put it up for sale in a varied selection of flavors .
Not laughing now , are you , smart guy ??
( via Trendhunter )
4 ) Diet Water : all the taste and none of the calories of regular water .
Huh ?
And now , from the " selling ice to the Eskimos " department , we bring you Diet Water : the soft drink for the soft headed .
" None of that rich , fattening Perrier for me , I 'm serious about shedding pounds ! "
Not to mention shedding money .
" Diet Water of the rich and famous " ?
We 're not sure what the appeal of Diet Water is ... maybe it has negative calories .
3 ) Final Fantasy Potion drinks : for those who think life really IS a game
Got a gamer at your house who lives , breathes and eats role - playing games like Final Fantasy ?
Now you can add " drinks " to the list , thanks to Final Fantasy Potion soft drinks .
Let 's see , at last count the stores were stocking Final Fantasy 13 .
No way to know if drinking a Final Fantasy Potion soft drink will restore your health , energy level - or make you invulnerable .
Kids , do n't try this at home !
( via Japan Newbie )
2 ) Canned Coffee = Canned Laughter
Canned coffee has been a staple of those omnipresent Japanese drink vending machines since the 1964 Tokyo Olympics .
Nothing wrong with the coffee itself , which is actually quite good .
It 's the wacky names ( c/o engrish.com ) the manufacturers insist on giving it that elevates Japanese canned coffee to immortality ( one brand in particular - read on ) .
There may just be a Top Ten Bizarre Japanese Canned Coffees list coming to this site one day soon .
A few " can " - didates :
BM Coffee - Nothing beats a good BM to start the day !
BJ Coffee - I stand corrected .
Deepresso Coffee -
Is this the opposite of Espresso , or a coffee designed to bring down Type A personalities ?
Black Boss Coffee - Decaffeinated AND desegregated , for the equal opportunity executive suite .
GOD Coffee -
What does one serve with GOD Coffee ?
Communion wafers ?
1 ) Kidsbeer : the Popeye Cigarettes of children 's drinks
We 've saved the most bizarre drink for last ... Kidsbeer .
We kid you not : Kidsbeer .
What can be said in defense of Kidsbeer , except maybe that it 's alcohol - free ?
That would be like saying Hitler was n't all bad because he liked dogs .
Kidsbeer is so wrong on so many levels it makes my head spin , yet it is so popular in Japan that monthly shipments are approaching 100,000 bottles .
As for the ad campaigns , nothing else will make you feel more like you 've blundered into Superman 's Bizarro world then seeing pre-teens - heck , pre-toddlers - joyfully guzzling their bottles of Kidsbeer .
A little background : Kidsbeer used to be a normal , average soda called Guarana until 2003 , when restaurant owner Yuichi Asaba renamed the bubbly brew " Kidsbeer " and watched sales go through the roof .
Normally , some sort of government watchdog would step in at this point and read Asaba the riot act , but nope .
Encouraged , Asaba farmed out production to the Tomomasu company , who made it less sweet , more frothy - more beer - like , if truth be told - and introduced brown bottles with labels resembling those of early Japanese beers .
Still the government watchdog slept on ( or maybe it 's drunk and passed out ) , so naturally other beverage , soft drink and soda makers scrambled to get a piece of the near - beer action .
Sangaria took one look at Kidsbeer 's skyrocketing sales and decided to go one better : wine and sparkling wine for kids !
Their product website is jaw - dropping in its audacity - and nicely done as well .
Wanna be like mommy & daddy , kids ?
Drink Kidsbeer , the Little Prince of Beers !
And that wraps up our list of the Top Ten Bizarre Japanese Soft Drinks , although we 've saved up enough dishonorable mentions to form the better part of a follow - up list .
Japan sure is a wonderful place , but it 's far from home in more ways than just travel time .
Barkeep , a frosty Kidsbeer for my friend - in a jelly glass !
UPDATE : Here 's 10 Even More Weird and Bizarre Japanese Soft Drinks
It is easy to tell if top officials are meeting ( Pic : East African Standard )
Kenya 's government has spent more than $ 12 m on new cars since 2002 - enough to send 25,000 children to school for eight years , their report said .
They groups said the government should buy smaller cars , possibly second - hand , to save money .
The government is already under pressure from a corruption scandal .
Judges are not cheap .
Kenyan judges are entitled to vehicles which are commensurate with their status
Dola Indidis
Judiciary spokesman
The government has launched an international aid appeal , for four million people going hungry in the north after poor rains .
" Conspicuous consumption makes a mockery of poverty alleviation efforts , besides creating resentment in society , " said the report by the local branch of Transparency International and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights .
" Additionally , the line between wasteful expenditure and grand corruption is very thin and because of this senior government officials continue to be perceived as corrupt . "
' Thin line '
Half of the $ 12 m was spent on 57 Mercedes Benz cars , the rest of it on four - wheel drive vehicles , said the report : Living Large : Counting the Cost of Official Extravagance in Kenya .
The High Court spent more money on luxury cars than any other government department , the report said .
KENYA'S LUXURY CARS Mercedes Benz : 57 Land Cruisers : 42 Mitsubishi Pajeros : 17 Nissan Terranos : 13 Nissan Patrols : 3 Purchased Jan 2003 - Sept 2004
Source : Living Large report
" Judges are not cheap .
Kenyan judges are entitled to vehicles which are commensurate with their status , " said judiciary spokesman Dola Indidis .
The authors said Kenya should copy the example of neighbouring Rwanda , which has severely restricted the use of luxury cars by public officials .
As well as buying cheaper cars , the authors recommended that Kenya use pool vehicles , rather than allocating cars individually .
Corruption was widespread under Kenya 's former government , with the elite known as " WaBenzi " for their love of imported luxury cars .
President Mwai Kibaki promised to stamp out corruption .
" " Would you open a Swiss bank account ?

­ James Bond enters a Swiss bank in Spain and is frisked before he can meet with the banker .
In the " Da Vinci Code , " a triangular - shaped key activates a robotic arm that pulls a safety deposit box from the wall in a Swiss bank in Paris to ultimately reveal the secret to Christianity .
The funny thing is neither of these scenes would actually happen in a real Swiss bank .
There is no such robotic system and , while Swiss banks do have security , they do n't search their clients before letting them access accounts .
Most of us have formed ideas about what Swiss bank accounts are and how they work based on scenes like these that we 've seen in the movies , read in books , or maybe even heard in the news .
In other words , most of us have a distorted or mostly unrealistic view of what it really means to have the prestigious Swiss bank account .
Let 's dig deeper into Swiss Bank Accounts and see how they started , who can have an account and unlock the mystery .
­ Swiss bank accounts are n't just for millionaires , criminals or government officials trying to hide ill - gotten wealth , or celebrities protecting their assets from former spouses .
They 're available to anyone and lots of average people have Swiss bank accounts .
People who live in countries with unstable governments and banks in particular often turn to Swiss banks because of their security and privacy .

WASHINGTON , May 2 — Members of a World Bank board committee investigating the conduct of Paul D. Wolfowitz , the bank president , are leaning toward finding that he violated the institution ’s rules against conflicts of interest when he arranged a pay raise and promotion for his companion , bank officials said Wednesday .
A conclusion that Mr. Wolfowitz broke the bank rules and the terms of his own contract , which bars conflicts of interest , would be likely to increase the pressure on him to resign despite his vow not to do so in the face of such charges .
But it was unclear how harsh the committee ’s judgment would be or what penalty would be recommended to the 24 - member board of directors that will decide his fate .
“ They have had long meetings late into the night and today to ensure that they are following due process , ” said a bank official briefed on the committee ’s discussions , noting that its work was occurring in secret in a highly charged atmosphere throughout the bank .
“ There is heavy drafting and redrafting going on . ”
At issue is a raise , promotion and promise of future raises that Mr. Wolfowitz arranged in 2005 for Shaha Ali Riza , his companion and a bank employee .
Mr. Wolfowitz said that he did so at the behest of top bank officials and that they cleared his actions .
Three of the officials who Mr. Wolfowitz says approved the arrangements for Ms. Riza are disputing that contention .
Micro-organisms which live in extreme conditions could probably survive on Mars , and could be similar to forms of life that might exist on other planets , according to two recent studies .
In this week ’s issue of Science , Lin et al report on a type of bacterium discovered in samples of groundwater obtained while drilling 2.8 km below the Earth ’s surface in the Mponeng gold mine in South Africa .
The bacteria are closely related to Desulfotomaculum kuznetsovii , a sulphate - reducing bacterium which lives near hydrothermal vents on the sea floor .
They obtain their energy by combining the hydrogen produced by the actions of decaying uranium on water with the sulphate produced by geothermal activity , and do not appear to be dependent on the sun .
First author Li-Hung Lin , of National Taiwan University , says that the bacteria “ probably represent relics of the surface community ” which slipped deep underground many millions of years ago and have survived down there ever since .
Lin ’s team estimates that this microbial community could take anywhere between 45 and 300 years to double in size , and has sustained itself in this seemingly inhospitable environment for at least 20 million years .
And , because of the slow but steady growth rate of the bacteria , and their resilience in the face of such harsh conditions , they could possibly sustain themselves beneath the surface of cold planets such as Mars .
The other study , published in the International Journal of Astrobiology , was carried out by a stronomers from NASA ’s Space Telescope Science Institute and microbiologists from the Center of Marine Biotechnology at the University of Maryland in Baltimore .
The astrobiology consortium investigated several types of archaea from Antarctica , where conditions have some similarities to those found on Mars .
Two of these archaea , Methanococcoides burtonii , a methanogen which uses hydrogen and carbon dioxide for energy and produces methane as a waste product , and Halorubrum lacusprofundi , a halophilic bacterium adapted to living in extremely salty conditions , were able to survive and reproduce at temperatures as low as - 2°C .
This is about 5 °C lower than what was thought to be the minimum limit for such microbial activity to take place .
The study also showed that t hese microbes appear to have evolved a special mechanism to help them to survive at these very low temperatures .
The mechanism involves the formation of cellular aggregates , and has never been observed in microbes before .
First author Neil Reid says
“ The low - temperature limits for both species fall within the temperature range experienced on present - day Mars and could permit survival and growth , particularly in sub-surface environments .
This could expand the realm of the habitable zone , the area in which life could exist , to colder Mars - like planets . ”
You ’d think that a philosopher could reason out the best way to behave , right ?
But you ’d be wrong , very wrong .
1 . Socrates , the Barefoot Bum Notoriously ugly , clad in one coat long beyond its years , and always shoeless , yet possessed of charisma that made the youth swoon , Socrates was a fixture in the marketplace of Athens .
There he would engage people with the Socratic method , beginning with a question that seemed straightforward and easy enough to answer , such as , What is virtue ?
Never content with the first answer , his irony and follow - up questions would inevitably lead to contradictions or admissions of ignorance on the part of his interlocutors .
Socrates rubbed some people the wrong way , though , and was brought to trial on trumpeted charges of impiety and corrupting the youth .
Defiant to the end , Socrates suggested that the proper sentence for his “ crimes ” would be free meals at the public expense , as he had done the city good .
The jury gave him a hemlock cocktail instead .
2 . Diogenes , a Cynic ’s Cynic Always suspicious of society and philosophers , Diogenes ( died ca. 320 BCE ) would stop at nothing to make a point .
He once ripped the feathers out of a live chicken to disprove Plato ’s account of human beings as the only featherless biped .
Asked once what wine he liked best , his cynical response was “ other peoples ’ . ”
Alexander the Great , intrigued by stories about Diogenes , sought him out and announced , “ I am Alexander the Great .
What can I do for you ? ”
“ Stand back – you block my light ” was Diogenes ’ response .
While the ordinary person would have lost his head after such an insult , Diogenes was admired all the more , as the great conqueror said , “ If I were not Alexander , I would be Diogenes . ”
3 . Peter Abelard ( 1079 - 1144 ) , the Castrated Cleric Sex scandals are nothing new to the Catholic Church .
Take the case of Abelard , the influential medieval philosopher who , ironically , did important work in ethics and logic .
The young cleric fell in love with a beautiful young girl named Héloïse , whom he was supposed to be tutoring , and they married secretly , though they lived apart .
Héloïse ’s uncle , however , mistakenly thought Abelard had discarded Héloïse by placing her in a convent , and he took revenge by having servants castrate Abelard in his sleep .
Abelard woke up and things were never the same between him and Héloïse ( needless to say , things were never the same between his legs either ) .
The ill - fated pair were , however , reunited in death , buried together at Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris and immortalized in song by Cole Porter : “ As Abelard said to Eloise , ‘ Do n’t forget to drop a line to me , please ’ ” ( from “ Just One of Those Things ” ) .
4 . Marx : Big Heart , Skinny Wallet Unable to find work as philosophy professor , Karl Marx ( 1818 - 1883 ) plotted a revolution .
Working intermittently as journalist and largely relying on the charity of friends , Marx lost many apartments and even some children for lack of financial resources .
Declaring religion “ the opiate of the masses , ” Marx found no solace in a better world to come , but instead sought to change the one he inhabited .
“ A specter is haunting Europe , “ he said , “ the specter of communism .
The workers of the world have nothing to lose but their chains . ”
History revealed Marx did n’t adequately anticipate capitalism ’s ability to shift and change to avoid the revolution , as later workers ’ movement won concessions in the form of labor laws , the welfare state , and five - day work week .
So , the next time you sleep late on a Saturday , make sure to give props to the man who made the dream of the weekend off a reality .
5 . Arthur Schopenhauer , Poodle - Loving Pessimist
The ultimate pessimist , Schopenhauer ( 1788 - 1860 ) viewed reality as a malicious trap , believing we live in the worst of all possible worlds .
A notorious misogynist , Schopenhauer once pushed a woman down a flight of stairs .
Grudgingly , he paid her regular restitution for her injuries until her death , when he recorded in his journal , “ The old woman dies , the burden is lifted . ”
Schopenhauer despised noise but inexplicably had a fondness for something more odious , poodles .
A series of disposable poodles were his constant companions for most of his life .
Not a pleasant academic colleague , Schopenhauer resented the success of Hegel , whose philosophy he thought was the worst kind of nonsense .
Perhaps planning to undo Hegel , Schopenhauer scheduled his course lectures at the same time as Hegel’s .
The result , however , was an early retirement for Arthur .
6 . Nietzsche : A Bad Boy Who Was n’t
One might think he railed against the corrupting influence of Christianity and declared “ God is dead , ” because of his own misery ( Nietzsche suffered from migraine headaches and poor digestion , topped off with bouts of insomnia ) .
But the guy whose autobiographical Ecce Homo includes such chapters as “ Why I Am So Wise , ” “ Why I Am So Clever , ” and “ Why I Write Such Good Books ” was actually an unassuming , mild - mannered man .
His belief in “ the will to power ” as the most basic human drive finds little reflection in his own life outside his fantasies .
Though he fancied himself a warrior and a ladies ’ man , Nietzsche ’s military service was brief and unspectacular , and he never had a lover .
As a bad boy in college , he may have visited a brothel or two , though .
One theory suggests that the insanity that cut his career short and institutionalized him for the last 11 years of his life was the result of untreated syphilis .
7 . Heidegger , Nazi Sympathizer
Though he originally planned to become a Catholic priest , this philosopher of being was far from holy .
He carried on an extramarital affair with his gifted student Hannah Arendt , who later fled Germany to avoid persecution as a Jew .
This might seem a peccadillo , except that Martin Heidegger was an anti-Semite who embraced the rise of Hitler ’s Third Reich .
Notoriously , Heidegger had his dictation dedication page in his Being and Time removed in subsequent printings of the book , as it paid homage to Edmund Husserl , his former teacher , a Jew .
At a time when intellectuals should have risen up , Heidegger sank to the lowest common denominator .
What ’s worse , he never recanted or apologized .
8 . Bertrand Russell , Cambridge Casanova
An innovator in mathematics and logic , and one of the founders of analytic philosophy , at first blush Russell sounds like a dry guy .
Yet his life was anything but dull .
Plagued by bouts of terrible depression as a young man , Russell learned to cultivate a zest for life .
This heavy - drinking , pipe - smoking professor was notorious for having affairs with his friends ’ wives .
He rejected organized religion with his famous essay “ Why I Am Not a Christian , ” but nonetheless had a passion for social justice , flirting with runs for political office and doing jail time for political protest , that last time at age 94 .
Notably , Russell was a leading intellectual voice against the war in Vietnam .
9 . Michel Foucault , the Marilyn Manson of Philosophy Always the outsider , Foucault ( 1926 - 1984 ) was the voice of the marginalized and oppressed , notably as a supporter of an inspiration for the Paris student uprisings of 1968 .
Making use of Nietzsche ’s insights on the nature of power and the method of historical investigation and exposure known as genealogy , Foucault challenged the legitimacy of dominant cultural structures .
Suspicious of institutions , in works such as Madness and Civilization , The Birth of the Clinic , and Discipline and Punish , Foucault called for the abolition of prisons and asylums .
Himself a homosexual , Foucault challenged our idea of what is normal in The History of Sexuality .
As a visiting professor at Berkeley , Foucault frequented the San Francisco bathhouses and developed a passion for S&M .
Though he kept his disease a private matter , he was the first ( and to date only ) major philosopher to die of AIDS .
Bonus : Pure Genius – Thales of Miletus Thales of Miletus ( ca. 624-546 BCE ) , the first Western philosopher , set the standard for absentminded professors to come .
Lost in thought , gazing at the sky , Thales fell into a well .
Ridiculed as an impractical dreamer , Thales set out to show that philosophers could do anything they set their minds to , including amassing wealth .
One winter , using his knowledge of meteorology and astronomy , Thales predicted a bumper olive crop for the coming season .
He cornered the market on olive presses in Miletus and made a fortune when the olive harvest met his expectations .
Remarkably , Thales predicted the solar eclipse of 585 BCE .
He also measured the height of the Egyptian pyramids using their shadows .
Thales is perhaps best known for arguing that water is the basic source element , that ultimately all things are made of water .
He also argued that “ all things are full of gods and have a share of soul , ” a poetic rendering of the insight confirmed by much later science that all matter is always in motion .
" Contrary to the bland stories in The New York Times and Washington Post of Friday , Negroponte did not go voluntarily to State from his job as director of intelligence .
In fact , there was tremendous administration pressure to get him out of his current job .
The chief cause of the quarrel involved Negroponte 's balking at at request from Vice President Cheney to increase domestic collection by the National Security Agency on U.S. citizens .
Negroponte flatly refused , Cheney bridled , and from then on the pressure built to get rid of him .
( The White House did not return phone calls , but there is nothing new is that . )
The Bush people , chiefly Cheney and the president , were already annoyed by the fact that the Negroponte group has been busy producing drafts of reports that predict utter disaster in Iraq and which are utterly opposed to any increase of troops .
Cheney and Bush both flared in wrath over this .
Of course , intelligence is simply evaluated information .
Its purpose is to help inform decisions by policymakers , as Pat as so often pointed out .
But this this administration perceives objectivity as a inadequate commitment or as an absence of complete loyalty .
The new national director of intelligence Adm . " Mike " McMConnell , has my sources at NSA tearing their hair out .
In the view of some very sharp analysts there he was " among the worst directors this agency ever had , " in the words of one .
But the rift over increased domestic surveillance was the real reason Negroponte was forced out .
I am frankly shocked by seasoned reporters at the NYT who would swallow statements such as Negroponte was never comfortable being a spy and therefore wanted to return to being a diplomat .
That is like the Steeler 's coach saying he is resigning to spend more time with his family .
Rice , of course , has been looking for a deputy since last June when Zoellick resigned to go to Goldman Sachs .
She first asked for Nick Burns , a very canny and experienced guy and that request was squashed by Cheney .
Burns will resign , I 'm told .
She asked for Phil Zoellick who is her special advisor and that went nowhere .
She finally negotiated with Bush first and then Cheney and got approval for Negroponte .
She can use his expertise on the Middle East .
One further note .
Regarding Cheney 's recent trip to Saudi Arabia .
Cheney went there to get the Wahabis to start ratcheting up actions against the Hizbullah in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region .
Saudi relations with Syria have cooled dramatically since the Hariri murder .
As senior CIA officials told me in 2001 , Hariri was a Saudi agent for a long time .
But one former CIA official told me that Saudi police the other day arrested a man because he put up Nasrallah 's picture up on his wall .
What CIA officials I talked to see is a major shift in the terrain -- a growing region - wide alliance between the Sunnis that will act as a counter to the growing power of the Shia thanks to the mindless U.S. backing of them Iraq .
My sources on this are excellent -- 8.5s out of 10s .

What ’s the penalty for the alleged gangrape of a drunk , 17 - year - old girl at a party with 10 of your buddies ?
Bupkus , said the Santa Clara , California District Attorney ’s office yesterday .
The alleged rape occurred March 3 at a wild , off - campus party hosted by a member of the DeAnza College men ’s baseball team in San Jose , California .
Three partygoers , members of the school ’s women ’s soccer team , said they saw a young girl on a mattress on the floor , clothes around her ankles and vomit on her face , with one man on top of her and approximately 10 more looking on in a dark bedroom .
Feeling “ something was n’t right , ” the girls pushed their way into the room and rushed the victim the the hospital .
In the months since the contested rape , a grand jury has taken testimony in the case , DNA samples from some partygoers have been obtained , but an assistant district attorney cited “ insufficient evidence ” as the reason the DA would not prosecute .
The men will not be charged with a crime , not even statutory rape .
The only consequences so far have been that eight baseball players were suspended , resulting in the cancellation of three games .
At least one of the players brought in by the grand jury thinks justice has been served : “ From the beginning , I kind of felt like it was a witch hunt and the De Anza players were victims , and not really this girl , ” pitcher Chris Knopf told the San Jose Mercury News .
One of the infamous Duke lacrosse players made a similar statement just last month when prosecutors dropped all charges in that case , saying that “ this entire experience has opened my eyes up to a tragic world of injustice . ”
He was talking about himself , not the African American stripper hired for the players ’ party .
Undoubtedly , the Duke case and its rush to judgment is in the minds of those at the Santa Clara DA ’s office when they say they do n’t have confidence the case could be proved without a doubt .
The District Attorney in the Duke case , Michael Nifong , was removed from the case and now faces ethics complaints from the North Carolina state bar related to the year - long investigation .
The Santa Clara DA office may be looking to avoid a similar debacle .
But there are essential differences in the two situations : this girl was underage , and three eyewitnesses have come forward .
Granted , eyewitness accounts are not always what they seem , something the media often glosses over , but the Santa Clara sheriff ’s office says it ’s not yet done investigating the case .
Two of the witnesses have gone to the media to draw attention to the case .
“ What we saw was rape .
It was a crime , ” one told told a local television station .
The other said the lack of charges “ makes us think that no girl is ever going to want to come forward and say they were violated as this girl was , because they ’re going to think it does n’t even matter …
But it does . ”

LUXEMBOURG glugs more than 15.5 litres of alcohol per person in a year , more than any other country .
One explanation is that the duty on alcohol is relatively cheap in the tiny nation , encouraging booze tourism from its more heavily taxed neighbours .
No such explanation for the Irish , however , who quaff 13.7 litres a year , according to the World Health Organisation .
European countries , with their cultural acceptance of alcohol , tend to dominate the top places .
In America , where stricter minumum - age requirements apply , the average person drinks 8.6 litres a year .

Half of Americans say they would n't vote for Clinton in '08 RAW STORY
Published : Friday June 29 , 2007 Print This Email
This " More than half of Americans say they would n't consider voting for Sen .
Hillary Clinton for president if she becomes the Democratic nominee , " according to a new poll , McClatchy Newspapers reports .
" The poll by Mason - Dixon Polling and Research found that 52 percent of Americans would n't consider voting for Clinton , D - N.Y , " William Douglas writes .
Clinton , the pace - setter in the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination , raised 27 million dollars in the last three months -- but still less than top rival Barack Obama , her campaign said Thursday .
As the closely - watched second quarter presidential race fundraising stakes drew to a close , campaigns jockeyed to spin their efforts in their best light possible , as a crucial Saturday deadline loomed .
Clinton campaign communications director Howard Wolfson said in an email that her three - month - take would be around 27 million dollars .
" To put that figure in some perspective , it is more than any Democrat has ever raised in the second quarter of the ' off ' year , " Wolfson said , referring to the year before a US presidential election .
" While that figure is record - setting , we do expect Senator Obama to significantly outraise us this quarter , " Wolfson wrote .
In the first quarter fundraising period , which saw an unprecedented windfall of campaign cash , Clinton stuffed 26 million dollars into her war chest , a few hundred thousand dollars more than Obama .
But the first - term Illinois senator 's figure stunned observers as he had to piece together a fundraising operation from scratch .
He was up against Clinton 's established network , including her fundraiser extraordinaire husband , former Democratic president Bill Clinton .
Obama 's campaign said on Thursday meanwhile that he was on course to receive donations from 250,000 individual donors by the June 30 deadline .
It did not give an estimate of his third - quarter take .
" Each donation to this campaign is a declaration of commitment to the idea that we can change our politics and elect a leader who will inspire and unite this country , " said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe .
Wolfson said the " bottom line " of the second quarter figures was that Clinton and Obama would both " raise a great deal of money . "
" Ultimately , this race will come down to the candidates themselves , their message and the quality of their campaigns , " he said .
Clinton has held a double digit lead in national polls of the Democratic field for months , and put up strong showings in a series of party debates .
Multi-million dollar campaign fundraising has often been called " the mother 's milk " of US politics , and is set to be even more important in what looks set to become the most expensive US election ever .
As well as powering huge countrywide campaigns and buying television advertising , fundraising totals are seen as a key indicator of a presidential hopeful 's viability .
Figures of a third Democrat , defeated 2004 vice presidential nominee John Edwards and struggling Republican John McCain will be closely watched this time around .
Both candidates are thought to be in danger of falling out of the crucial first - tier of party candidates unless they turn in a strong performance .
Edwards 's campaign Thursday sent an email urging supporters to work within the last 72 hours up to the deadline to help him reach his goal of nine million dollars in the quarter .
( with wire reports ) Excerpts from McClatchy report : # Clinton has long been considered a politically polarizing figure who'd be a tough sell to some voters , especially many men , but also Clinton - haters of both genders .
Thursday 's survey provides a snapshot of the challenges she faces , according to Larry Harris , a Mason - Dixon principal .
" Hillary 's carrying a lot of baggage , " he said .
" She 's the only one that has a majority who say they can't vote for her . "
Clinton rang up high negatives across the board , with 60 percent of independents , 56 percent of men , 47 percent of women and 88 percent of Republicans saying they would n't consider voting for her .

An estimated 93.5 percent of motorists in the EU are driving on under - inflated tires and causing an additional 84 million tons of carbon dioxide to be released into the environment .
These 84 million tons are the equivalent of 56 million tires being wasted .
To collect this data , Bridgestone conducted free check - ups at various shopping centers and public car parks throughout Europe .
Based on 2006 data , Bridgestone also estimates 40 percent of vehicles absorb an additional 2.8 percent in fuel , due to their under - inflated tires , wasting 8.1 billion liters ( 2.14 billion gallons ) of fuel every year .

Google soars to pass IBM valuation dpa German Press Agency
Published : Tuesday October 24 , 2006 San Francisco -
Internet advertising giant Google has surpassed IBM to become the world 's third most valuable technology company , trailing only behind software giant Microsoft and network leader Cisco .
With the company 's stock trading around 475 dollars per share Tuesday , Google 's market capitalization reached some 145 billion dollars , surpassing the total value of IBM at 139.5 billion .
Google leapfrogged the venerable tech giant when its shares surged over 5 per cent on Monday following the reporting of stellar financial results last week which saw its profits almost double compared to the corresponding period one year ago .
Google 's value easily exceeds that of other tech giants like Hewlett - Packard ( 109 billion dollars ) and Intel ( 123 billion dollars ) .
It has an even clearer lead over other web companies like eBay ( 45 billion dollars ) , Yahoo ( 32 billion dollars ) and Amazon ( 14 billion dollars ) .
It is now breathing down the neck of Cisco , which has a value of around 147.5 billion dollars , but still has a long way to go to catch Microsoft at 279 billion dollars .
Google is worth some 58 billion dollars more than the combined value of America 's three largest automakers DaimlerChrysler ( 54 billion dollars ) , General Motors ( 20 billion dollars ) and Ford ( 15 billion dollars ) .
The world 's most valuable enterprise is oil company ExxonMobil , which is valued at 416 billion dollars .
Other business giants are General Electric worth approximately 367 billion dollars and the world 's largest retailer Wal - Mart with a value of about 214 billion dollars .
The two Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have fortunes of around 14 billion dollars each and are the youngest members of the Forbes list of the richest Americans , where they occupy places 12 and 13 .

Ignorance of UK sites was a disadvantage
Others were turned down because they had never previously taken any foreign travel or could not speak English .
The " ridiculous reasons " for rejecting visas were set out in a report by the independent monitor of UK visas .
Linda Costelloe
Baker 's report said that despite such flaws there had been " significant improvement in quality . "
But she said entry clearance officers could use " some ridiculous reasons when refusing visa for tourist visits " .
She said a common reason for refusal was " you wish to go to the UK for a holiday .
You have never previously undertaken any foreign travel before and I can see little reason for this trip " .
EXAMPLES OF NON - PLAIN ENGLISH USED BY STAFF
The provenance of the funds depicted is not evidenced allied to other financial commitments
You have failed to complete pivotal areas of Section 6 I can only assess your mutual knowledge in a subjective context Source : Independent Monitor
In her report she says " this is a common reason for refusal but there was a first time for everyone who has gone abroad on a holiday and not having done it before is an acceptable reason for travel " .
Another reason to reject a tourist visa was " you plan a holiday for no particular purpose other than sightseeing " .
On the use of that reason , she says : " But that 's what the UK is famous for , sights worth seeing . "
' Live like a housewife '
She said the numbers of British people " going on their hols " would be cut if other countries emulated the UKvisas officials who rejected a tourist visa request because the applicant did not have a " sufficient command of the language for the purposes of tourism " .
She also highlights the case of a person whose request was rejected by an officer because they had " little or no idea what you plan to see or do " .
This was , she discloses , because the person had answered the question on a form asking why they were going to the UK , with the words " annual leave vacation " .
That was a " perfectly sensible response " , Mrs Costelloe Baker said .
Another woman was criticised for not researching the UK 's background when she said she wanted to spend her four - month visit to her fiance to " just live as a housewife " .
" I suspect being a housewife for four months was all she wanted to do and the Immigration Rules allow that , " Mrs Costelloe Baker said .
She said it was " a little naive to worry about a list of tourist sights " being outlined if applicants wanted to visit close friends .
An applicant in St Petersburg wrote : " I just want a holiday , my friends live near the seaside " to which the officer wrote " you have not named any places you will see " .
Mrs Costelloe
Baker said this was not the case - the applicant had named the " seaside " .
' Plain English please ! '
In one case , a man was refused a visa because the officer thought it not credible that he was going to stay in a hotel in Cirencester " far from [ his ] friends in Surrey and Kent " .
The hotel was in fact in London and the man had told the officer that he had not wanted to put a burden on his friends for his entire 28 - day visit .
Mrs Costelloe Baker said the man had been offered another application free of charge and she hoped he would get an apology as well .
She also said there had been improvement in the language used to explain refusals to applicants since the " very strange wordings " seen during her previous assessment .
But she still called for " plain English please ! "
The report covers the first nine months of 2006 , which had been a very busy period for UKvisas .
Mrs Costelloe Baker , who is independent but appointed by the Foreign Office , concluded that overall " there has been a significant improvement in the quality of UKvisas work compared with 2005 and I have found that refusal notices are more consistent and less idiosyncratic " .
Russians threatened by GM Genocide
( See Note 1 on title )
Only in " MK " : the shocking results of checking GM products
Until now , scientists cannot accurately say whether genetically modified ( GM ) products are dangerous for man .
Serious and independent studies are necessary .
But now after the " Frankenstein Food " scare it will cost a great deal of money , and to find the means to undertake research is very difficult .
This problem has been encountered by our scientists , among them the leading scientist of the RAS [ Russian Academy of Sciences ]
Institute , Irina Ermakova .
She and her team conducted a series of experiments on rats , but they were not given funding to finish the work - they ran over their limited budget .
However , even those results which it was possible to obtain , proved very shocking to the scientists involved .
The sensational studies of Irina Ermakova were described in " MK " .
Studies of trans - genes should be free from lobbying or interference .
Q- Why can GM products be dangerous ?
First , during the process of introduction genes can be mutated themselves and also exert a negative influence on the genome of plants .
Second , in the GM plants novel toxic proteins can be formed , and therefore trans - genes can cause toxicoses or allergy in man .
A fantastic story appeared about how as a result of genetic manipulations the new plants led people to blindness – but that can become reality even today .
Third , the methods of gene insertion are not perfect and do not guarantee the safety of the plants created with their help .
There exist two most common methods .
The first - bombardment of cells by the microparticles of gold or tungsten with the substituted genes on them .
In this case it is unknown how many new genes there will be and where in the genome of the cell they will be incorporated .
The second ( more extended and more dangerous ) - the introduction of genes with the help of the plasmids from Agrobacterium tumefaciens .
In studies by German scientists mice were fed with food containing plasmids with the green fluorescent protein gene .
Green fluorescent proteins were found in different organs of the mice and their offspring .
Before beginning my studies I also hypothesized that the plasmids and foreign DNA from the GM plants could reach the cells of different organs of human body - the blood , sexual organs , the sperm , etc. , causing subsequently tumors , mutation and the disturbance of reproductive function .
Q - Was it important to you to conduct your experiments exclusively on animals ?
Yes .
With the help of the tests which are currently used to investigate GM plants , it is impossible to determine whether they are dangerous .
But in animals fed by GMO , results can be seen sufficiently rapidly : an animal will begin to be ill , and will experience damage to its reproductive functions , behavior , etc .
Q - And why precisely rats ?
Some scientists assure us that people and rats are very different !
Research has shown that people differ genetically much less , for example , from the mice , than had been assumed .
Although we do not have any tails and whiskers , in the structure of our organism and in biochemistry we are very close .
Rats - convenient objects for a study - are unpretentious and inexpensive .
However , it is true that the authorities rapidly stopped the financing of my experiment .
As soon as it started , there was pressure on the Institute from the GM product lobby .
And they recommended to me that I should not persist with this study .
I was also told that in this interview I should not mention the full name of the Institute where I work .
Q- What form , specifically , did that pressure take ?
As I said , two academicians , lobbyists for the GM industry , approached the presidium of RAS [ Russian Academy of Science ] with a requirement that I should terminate my studies .
This was connected with the fact that there is already a large flow of transgenic products into our market , that nothing can be done to stop it , and that it is not desirable to disturb people .
Their position is this : you are being targeted , and we will stand to one side .
Q- But now , it is probable that everything will be different ?
Has n’t Yuri Luzhkov personally allocated some money from the capital budget to the continuation of your experiments ?
That money is already allocated , but our Institute has rejected our application for investigations on this theme .
So now studies will continue in other scientific research institutes , and to carry them out there will be not only I , but also other scientists as well .
Glory to God , that desire was recognized by others and then supported .
Moreover the National Association of Genetic Safety announced the beginning of the world 's first truly public experiment .
It is principally important to gather resources from independent sources so that no one can suspect lobbying .
In the experiment , which will go online , not only Moscow scientists have agreed to participate , but also scientists from other municipalities .
Funding is needed in order to lease accomodation , to install video cameras , to begin to employ people .
In my previous studies I had to use my own personal money , and I had the help of just one woman .
Thanks to that freedom , I could conduct the experiments without interference , and now very many people speak quite freely about my findings .
References to the studies exist on 40 thousand web sites .
My experiments have been described in different countries : in England , USA , Australia and elsewhere .
I have been invited to give lectures in Japan .
The influence of GM plants on other organisms is an enormous scientific problem , which most biotechnologists ( in view of their vested interests ) cannot solve .
Moreover scientists must be allowed to carry out the scientific protocols of a study , independent from funding companies and producers of GMOs .
Q- Is it complicated to undertake these experiments ?
There are no technical problems .
But , unfortunately , something incomprehensible has happened .
I have obtained many letters from scientists from the different parts of the world .
And all acknowledge that they do not have the possibility to conduct truly independent studies .
Thus , an Austrian scientist wrote : " I just wish you much luck in the future , because such results will mean , that you will have a hard conflict with a lot of western industry interests .
Industry - affiliated scientist will lobby against you - and for sure a lot of so - called scientific panels for food - safety and “ competent ” authorities will try to ignore your results or will try to hinder the publication of your papers . ”
There is also the history of an associate from Australia , who submitted to the government of her country a proposal to repeat my experiments .
At once attacks began in the Internet , while pressure was exerted on the government from the side of the GM product lobby .
Then a letter arrived from the Netherlands .
First they wrote : " We do not believe you " .
I answered : " This is unscientific - to believe or not believe .
You can verify " .
After several months I again received a letter from one of them : " My expert friends in England know of no similar experiment elsewhere .
Neither do I . It was to be expected .
They know what they would if they were to look .
The only " safe " way for them is to close their eyes .
These people are led and misled by an evil force which is unimaginable .
That 's my impression .
We must keep up our good work !
We 'll win eventually . ”
Please note the fact that it is almost impossible to obtain funding for such studies by grants , but even if it is possible to find resources and do the work , it is almost impossible to publish the results in the peer - reviewed scientific publications .
Companies refuse to allow GM material for studies , or they require instead complete control over the experiments .
When farmers buy in a company ’s GM seeds , they have to sign a contract saying that they may not pass them on for research purposes .
By the way , very frequently the GM seeds do not germinate , and farmers are forced to buy them again .
In India there was an increase in suicides among farmers .
Mixed seeds were sold to them ( both traditional and GM ) .
After only two years they could not obtain a harvest : their seeds did not germinate .
Even normal plants as a result of repollination became barren .
In this situation the producers of transgenic seeds quite simply can arrange hunger at any point on the planet ( in the future including Russia ) , having simply refused to sell seeds to the country .
That important producer of GM cultures , the Monsanto Corporation , has already stated that all of the seeds on the planet will be transgenic in 10 - 15 years ’ time .
Q- Can you describe your experiment in more detail ?
I developed nothing new .
It is all described in the documents on the checking of GM products .
In such cases and in the operating instructions of the chief sanitation inspector of Russia Onishchenko in 2000 .
Approximately the same scheme of experiments was used , although I did not know about these guidelines .
True , in the document signed by Onishchenko it is recommended that the experiments must be carried out on five generations of rats , but you will not find such studies anywhere !
Although some producers of GMOs carry out experiments on animals , they feed them very cunningly - they begin to feed females during the pregnancy , when the maternal organism protects embryos from harmful effects .
But here if we begin to feed before mating and then continue to the end of the growing phase of the young rats , the probability of negative impacts on the organism sharply grows .
To companies , which conduct similar studies , negative results are undesirable .
According to available data , of 500 scientists , who work in the biotechnology in Great Britain , 30 % were forced on the request of sponsors to change the data from their experiments .
I conducted several series of experiments .
In essence we studied the physiological conditions and level of mortality of young rats in the first and second generations .
In the first block 30 females , divided into 4 groups , were investigated .
To the 1st group we gave together with the usual chow GM soybean flour ; normal soya was added into the chow of 2nd group ; the 3rd group had protein isolate flour made from GM soy , and the 4th group ( control ) was fed with standard chow without any additives .
Rats were fed before mating and during mating , pregnancy and lactation .
In the whole experiment we investigated 221 young rats .
The most negative result ( we did not expect that everything would go so badly ! ) we obtained in the group " GM soya " .
More than half of the young rats ( 51,6 % ) from the first generation died during the first three weeks of life , and of those remaining alive , more than a third proved to be 1,5 - 2 times less in size and weight , compared with the young rats from the control groups .
They were weakened and underdeveloped .
Curiously , even in the group " usual soya " we measured a reduction in the weight of the animals , although , according to theory , the addition of protein to the usual food should have led to the opposite result .
When then we took the surviving females and the males of the first generation from the group " GM soya " , we did not obtain any progeny from them .
With the mating of the females of the first generation from the group " GM soya " with the males from control group there were offspring , but they were very weakened .
In another series of experiments morphologists investigated the state of the internal organs of animals .
Serious pathologic changes were revealed in the liver ( it was like a sieve ) and in the testes in the males ( they proved to be cyanotic , but not pink ) .
It was desirable to further investigate the heart , brain , spleen and other organs , but we did not have the resources at that moment .
I did not expect that the results obtained by me would cause such stormy discussion .
But it is still more surprising to me , that these simple experiments have not been repeated by anybody in one - and - a - half years .
So I have been conducting a new series of experiments using again , mainly , my own money .
Q- Are the results already available ?
Results obtained thus far are processed , but already it is possible to say the following : the results of the first experiments have been confirmed .
These new studies were necessary also in order to exclude the action of herbicide on rat posterity .
It is considered that in the GM soya , resistant to Roundup herbicide ( I used precisely similar ) , the herbicide can be accumulated and can negatively influence embryos .
Therefore I changed the scheme of the feeding a little : males and females were fed by GM soya only 2 weeks prior to mating and 2 - - 3 days during the mating ( for each case ) .
However the females did n’t get GM soya during pregnancy and lactation .
The picture came out the same as in the previous experiments .
In the group " GM soya " the mortality of young rats was more than 50 % , and there are very many underdeveloped young rats .
Q- Have they put personal pressure on you during your studies ?
Yes .
Indeed , they put pressure not only on us as researchers , but also on those who supported us .
But I do not want to speak about this .
Another thing is important .
The risks which are associated with GM plants , can lead to the extinction of all life on our planet .
Plants and animals play an important role in the creation of climate , and which is currently created by the weather !
This can be a consequence of the large - scale propagation of GM cultures .
The majority of GMOs , through 1 - - 2 or several generations , become barren .
And it is possible that those who eat them , through just two generations , will also become incapable of the reproduction of their own kind .
Specifically , this is connected with the sharp reduction of biodiversity in fields containing GM crops .
Q- Are n't you afraid of conducting such studies ?
I am frequently asked about this .
But what am I to make of it ?
There is no other way to proceed .
I cannot fail to be involved in this problem .
We underestimate the dangers of GM , and if we do not now undertake action , then tomorrow it may be too late .
This is the first stage : to study , to test and to take measurements .
And to do this as quickly as possible .
I will be grateful to all who will support the beginning of this public scientific experiment on checking the safety of GM products .
BY THE WAY ………
As early as 2000 , 828 scientists of 84 countries around the world signed an open letter to the governments of all countries about the danger of the genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) .
Now such signatures have risen to more than 2 thousand .
The scientists are asking for a moratorium on the use of trans - genes in food .

Note ( 1 ) The use of the word “ Genocide ” in the title of this piece might seem surprising – and we thought initially that we might have mis-translated from the Russian .
But it can be argued , quite reasonably , that if the GM corporations are aware of the fact that their products are harmful , and that sterility is one of the side - effects of consuming GM food over an extended period , then their attempt to take control of the world ’s seed supplies and to replace indigenous staple crops with GM varieties could be viewed as genocidal .
At what point does “ turning a blind eye ” transpose into “ intent ” ?

New evidence shows that the human brain can manufacture fresh brain cells , researchers say in a study that may lead to better ways to treat brain damage and disease .
Scientists had known that other animals , such as rats and mice , make new brain cells throughout their lives and there had been indirect evidence that humans beings can , too .
Using magnetic resonance imaging , or MRI , scans and electron microscope images of tissue donated from the brains of people who died , Maurice Curtis of the University of Auckland in New Zealand and Peter Eriksson of Sahlgrenska Academy in Goteborg , Sweden , and colleagues found the elusive cells .
I recently upgraded my dedicated racing simulation PC , so I was forced to re-install Windows XP SP2 , along with all the games .
As I was downloading the no-cd patches for the various racing sims I own , I was suddenly and inexplicably deluged with popups , icons , and unwanted software installations .
I got that sinking feeling : I had become the unfortunate victim of a spyware infestation .
Of course , this is completely my own fault for browsing the web using the 2004 - era web browser included with a default install of Windows XP Service Pack 2 .
If I was thinking rationally , I would have downloaded Firefox first , or at least connected to Windows Update to get the latest patches , before venturing on to the open internet .
But I figured I 'd save myself that work , and just pop into a few specific web sites for a few quick downloads .
Could n't hurt , right ?
Let my mistake be a lesson to everyone reading this : never browse the web without the very latest version of your preferred web browser .
Intentionally choosing to browse the web with a three year old browser , as I did , is an incredibly dangerous thing to do .
The consequences in this case are fairly minimal since this is n't even my secondary machine -- it 's a special - purpose PC dedicated to gaming .
Reinstalling the operating system is no big deal .
But it 's still an inconvenient timesink , and in any case , the spyware infestation has to be dealt with because it causes serious performance problems and will even interrupt gameplay with incessant popups .
The two most common sites for no-cd patches are MegaGames and GameCopyWorld .
In case you 're wondering , yes , I do own all my games .
I download no-cd patches for convenience 's sake ; I consider them a privilege of ownership for knowledgeable , ethical PC gamers .
I figured the infection came from one of these sites .
So I set up a honeypot virtual machine under Virtual PC 2007 , using the ancient , original 2001 release of Windows XP and the classic Devil 's Own key , and began testing .
Here 's a shot of Task Manager at the desktop , after installing the necessary virtual machine additions .
This is a completely plain vanilla , clean Windows XP installation : no service packs , no updates , no nothing .
This system is connected to the internet , but it 's not as dangerous as it sounds .
Because it 's behind a NAT router that blocks all incoming connections , there 's no way it can get passively infected .
I let it connect to the internet and quiesce at the desktop for about an hour , just to prove my point .
No passive infections occurred behind a NAT router , even for this woefully out of date September 2001 era install of Windows XP .
Now we 're leaving passivity behind , and unwisely browsing the open internet with the unpatched , six year old original version of Internet Explorer 6.0 .
Danger , Will Robinson !
I left Task Manager running as I browsed to MegaGames , downloaded a no-cd patch , and ... nothing .
I then visited GameCopyWorld , downloaded a no-cd patch , and ... all of a sudden , it 's crystal clear who the culprit is .
Check out Task Manager now :
This comes as a shock to me , because GameCopyWorld is recommended often in gaming forums .
I consider ( ed ) it a reputable web site .
I 've never had a problem with the site before , because I usually surf with the latest updates .
But the unpatched browser spyware infestation from visiting GCW -- just from visiting the web pages , even if you do n't download a single thing -- is nearly immediate and completely devastating .
The virtual machine desktop , after a few scant minutes , tells the story :
It is n't pretty , and let me tell you , I have a new degree of sympathy for the poor users who become the unfortunate victims of spyware infestations .
The machine becomes borderline unusable , between ...
new icons that magically appear on your desktop
full - screen popups that occur every two minutes
dialog boxes that offer to " install antivirus software " with only an OK button
system performance degradation from all those spyware background processes
... it 's a wonder people do n't just give up on computing altogether .
Once the door is open , it seems the entire neighborhood of malware , spyware , and adware vendors take up residence in your machine .
There should be a special circle of hell reserved for companies who make money doing this to people .
At first , I was mad at myself for letting this happen .
I should know better , and I do know better .
Then I channeled that anger into action : this is my machine , and I 'll be damned if I will stand for any slimy , unwanted malware , adware , or spyware that takes up residence on it .
I resolved to clean up my own machine and fix the mess I made .
It 's easier than you might think , and I 'll show you exactly how I did it .
Our first order of business is to stop any spyware that 's currently running .
You 'll need something a bit more heavy - duty than mere Task Manager -- get Sysinternals ' Process Explorer .
Download it , run it , and sort the process list by Company Name .
Kill any processes that do n't have a Company Name ( with the exception of DPCs , Interrupts , System , and System Idle Process ) .
Right - click the processes and select Kill , or select them and press the Delete key .
You can use my initial screenshot of Task Manager , at the top of this post , as a reference for what should be running in a clean Windows XP installation .
But there 's usually no need to be that specific ; unless it has a Company Name you recognize , it 's highly likely to be a rogue application and should be terminated .
Stopping the running spyware is only half the battle .
Now we need to stop the spyware from restarting the next time we boot the system .
Msconfig is a partial solution , but again we need something more powerful than what is provided out of the box .
Namely , SysInternals ' AutoRuns utility .
Download it , run it , and start browsing through the list that appears :
As you can see , there 's a bunch of spyware , malware , adware , and god knows what else gunking up the works -- all from visiting a single website !
Scroll through the list , all the way to the bottom , scanning for blank Publishers , or any Publisher you do n't recognize .
If you see anything that 's suspect , delete it !
In a default Windows install , 99.5 % of the entries will have " Microsoft Corporation " as the Publisher .
Any reputable vendor will have no problem attaching their name to their work , so it 's generally only the blank entries you need to worry about .
Now reboot the system .
We 've removed most of the spyware infestation , but there 's a certain much more virulent class of spyware that can survive this treatment .
We 'll deal with them next .
After rebooting , check Process Explorer and Autoruns for anything suspicious , exactly as we did before .
The first thing I noticed that " came back " in Autoruns was a suspicious driver , core.sys , that did n't have a Publisher .
I used the powerful Find | Find Handle or DLL menu in Process Explorer to locate any active references to this file .
Unfortunately I did n't capture the right screenshot at the time , so I 'm showing a generic search result above .
Anyway , there was exactly one open handle to the core.sys file .
I selected the result , which highlights the corresponding handle in the lower pane of the Process Explorer view .
Right - click the handle entry in the lower pane and click " Close Handle " .
After I closed the handle , I could physically delete the rogue core.sys file from the filesystem , along with the Autoruns entry for it .
Problem solved !
The other item that reappeared in Autoruns after the reboot was an oddly named DLL file with hooks into Winlogon and Explorer .
In addition to the suspicious name , each entry carries the tell - tale sign of the missing Publisher value :
Delete the entries in Autoruns all you want ; they 'll keep coming back when you press F5 to refresh .
This rogue , randomly named DLL continually monitors to make sure its ugly little hooks are in place .
The nasty thing about processes attached to Winlogon is that they 're very difficult to kill or remove .
We can kill Explorer , but killing Winlogon is not an option ; it 's the root process of Windows , so shutting it down causes the OS to restart .
It 's a difficult catch - 22 .
But we 're smarter than the malware vendors .
Fire up Process Explorer and use the Find | Find Handle or DLL menu to locate all the instances of this DLL by name .
( See , I told you this option was powerful . )
Kill any open handles to this file that you find , exactly as we did before .
But you 'll need to go one step further .
We know from the Autoruns that this DLL is likely to be attached to the Explorer and Winlogon processes , but let the find results be your guide .
Double - click on any processes you found that reference this DLL .
In the process properties dialog , select the Threads tab .
Scroll through the threads and kill every one that has the rogue DLL loaded .
Once you 've killed all the threads , you can finally delete the entries in Autoruns without them coming back .
Reboot , and your machine is now completely free of spyware .
I count 17 entries in Task Manager , exactly the same number as when I originally started .
Of course , the smartest thing to do is not to get infected with spyware , malware , or adware in the first place .
I can't emphasize this enough : always browse with the latest patches for your preferred web browser .
But if you do happen to get infected , at least now you have the tools and knowledge to banish these evildoers from your machine forever .
Posters of a ' White List ' of clothing stores deemed Kosher by ultra-Orthodox standards popped up everywhere on Monday in the Bnei Brak haredi town .
The posters call for women to only purchase clothes from the 30 approved stores as these establishments comply with the strict laws and regulations of haredi religion .
Modesty Guard Rabbis : Modesty slacking , stand guard !
Ynet Thousands of haredim participate in conference warning of slacked modesty amongst women .
Married men only attend conference ; learn about allowed shirt length , skirt size , wigs Rabbis : Modesty slacking , stand guard !
The notices were printed by the self proclaimed ' store monitoring committee ' , all in an effort to battle the ' promiscuity problem ' apparently rampant throughout the city .
Women are requested to cooperate with the initiative ( dreamt up by the men of the ' Guard of the House of Jacob ' , the organization which oversees all the rabbinical courts in Bnei Brak ) and only shop at the aforementioned 30 stores so as to empower the pious stores .
Shoshana , a saleswoman at the ' Bat Melech ' ( King 's Daughter ) apparel store told Ynet what conditions were required of the store to be listed as on of the 30 approved stores .
" We pledged that young men wo n't be in a position where they may sell clothing here , " explained Shoshana , " we also made sure that our merchandise was deemed appropriate according to the Halacha .
For instance – we wo n't sell a red-colored garment .
Nor do we carry form fitting clothes or slit skirts that reveal the legs . "
Shoshana said that many new businesses have come to the city after entrepreneurs recognized the potential of the market in Bnei Brak , businesses that do n't bother keeping with the rules of modesty .
" All these stores from Tel Aviv showed up , the owners put yarmulkes on their heads and started selling clothes .
I keep to the guidelines not because it is profitable , but because I believe , ever since I was born , that I must do what the rabbis say . "
However to receive the coveted Kosher label Shoshana was required to take down items that failed to pass the modesty test , like shirts that were declared too tight .
Danger in the streets : Fashion
The war on promiscuity picked up steam some six months ago when stores in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv belonging to the same chain were burned by radical haredim .
In the Geula neighborhood in Jerusalem ' immodest ' women were attacked with bleach which was sprayed onto their clothes .
Ultra-Orthodox rabbis decided to institutionalize their struggle , holding an emergency conference on the subject six weeks ago .
The event took place in the presence of the Lithuainia haredi public ’s leading rabbis , including Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv and Rabbi Aharon Liv Steinman .
The conference was intended for yeshiva students only , meaning married men , most of whom are fathers of young daughters .

There is yet another United States attorney whose abrupt departure from office is raising questions : Debra Wong Yang of Los Angeles .
Ms. Yang was not fired , as eight other prosecutors were , but she resigned under circumstances that raise serious questions , starting with whether she was pushed out to disrupt her investigation of one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress .
If the United States attorney scandal has made one thing clear , it is that the riskiest job in the Bush administration is being a prosecutor investigating a Republican member of Congress .
Carol Lam , the United States attorney in San Diego , was fired after she put Randy Cunningham , known as Duke , in prison .
Paul Charlton , in Arizona , was dismissed while he was investigating Rick Renzi .
Dan Bogden , in Nevada , was fired while he was reportedly investigating Jim Gibbons , a congressman who was elected governor last year .
Ms. Yang was investigating Jerry Lewis , who was chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee .
Ms. Lam and most of the other purged prosecutors were fired on Dec. 7 . Ms. Yang , in a fortuitously timed exit , resigned in mid-October .
Ms .
Yang says she left for personal reasons , but there is growing evidence that the White House was intent on removing her .
Kyle Sampson , the Justice Department staff member in charge of the firings , told investigators last month in still - secret testimony that Harriet Miers , the White House counsel at the time , had asked him more than once about Ms. Yang .
He testified , according to Congressional sources , that as late as mid-September , Ms. Miers wanted to know whether Ms. Yang could be made to resign .
Mr. Sampson reportedly recalled that Ms. Miers was focused on just two United States attorneys : Ms. Yang and Bud Cummins , the Arkansas prosecutor who was later fired to make room for Tim Griffin , a Republican political operative and Karl Rove protégé .
Skype yesterday petitioned the FCC to lay the smack down on wireless phone carriers who " limit subscribers ' right to run software communications applications of their choosing " ( read : Skype software ) .
Skype wants the agency to more stringently apply the famous 1968 Carterfone decision that allowed consumers to hook any device up to the phone network , so long as it did not harm the network .
In Skype 's eyes , that means allowing any software or applications to run on any devices that access the network .
The reason for Skype 's interest in the issue is obvious : they want to force network operators to allow Skype - enabled calling across their networks , something currently prohibited on wireless data plans .
In its filing , Skype argues that this capability would offer " tremendous new sources of price competition provided by entities such as Skype , " and that 's exactly why wireless operators will fight the plan tooth and nail .
Something similar has happened before .
In the early days of the wired telephone network , the phone company provided not only network service , but also the equipment , and routinely took firms to court if they sold products meant to be attached to consumer telephones ( which were still owned by the phone company ) .
In 1956 , a court ruled that a device called the Hush - a - Phone was allowed to be fitted onto the telephone so long as it was " privately beneficial without being publicly detrimental . "
In 1968 , the FCC endorsed this principle in the Carterfone case .
The Carterfone was an early attempt at building a wireless phone .
It used a two - way radio and an acoustic coupler to patch a person 's voice into the telephone network , and the FCC again ruled that this was allowed so long as the network itself was not harmed .
The principle is still in place today , and wired phone networks now stop at a small termination box usually located on the outside of homes ; anything past that point is the homeowner 's responsibility , but phones , modems , and faxes can all be hooked up to the network without requiring phone company permission .
This principle currently affects the wired telephone network , the cable TV network ( any set - top box can be hooked up to any cable system , at least in theory , once the " integration ban " goes into effect later this year ) , and the data networks offered by both services ( DSL and cable , which can be hooked up to any device inside the home ) .
Wireless phone networks are a different story .
Defenders of the status quo argue that this is n't a problem , since plenty of competition already exists in the market , and the invisible hand of the market will inevitably provide that which consumers want better than any government regulation can do .
Unfortunately , the " invisible hand " has been a little too invisble here , and no operator actually offers a wide - open network .
Skype thinks a smidgen of government regulation could actually help out quite a bit , and they cite Dr. Tim Wu's recent paper on wireless network neutrality for support .
Skype ( and Wu's paper ) point out the various ways that the wireless phone companies block consumer choice : crippling features on phones , locking handsets to operators , limiting consumers ' ability to install third - party applications , and limiting the terms of service with bandwidth caps and restrictions on what content can be accessed through the network ( Skype calls are forbidden , for instance ) .
Skype essentially wants to turn the wireless phone companies into just another network of the kind currently operated on the ground .
This would require carriers to allow any phone to be used on their networks , and for any application .
Users would simply purchase a voice or data plan ( though these could easily converge into a data plan if VoIP calling is used ) and then use the device of their choice to access the network of their choice .
Verizon , Cingular , et al. hate this and would love to keep crippling WiFi and Bluetooth access on their phones in order to keep traffic flowing through their network , using their ( high - priced ) services .
Recognizing that its proposal would pose some thorny technical problems , Skype " approaches these issues with humility , recognizing that application - layer competition depends in part upon the 3G deployment efforts of wireless carriers . "
They suggest the creation of an FCC - guided forum to handle technical specifications , one that would operate transparently and would involve all stakeholders in the issue .
The forum , in Skype 's view , would ensure that " no entity can enforce techniques such as blocking , locking , or certification requirements that have the intention of preventing consumers from modifying or installing software unless it is reasonably proven that such software harms the network . "
The wireless operators do n't have any intention of being reduced to mere commodity providers of network services if they can help it , and this recent filing certainly wo n't raise Skype 's reputation within the industry .
Of course , since that industry already restricts
Skype from running on its network , this is no big loss .
WASHINGTON , May 22 ( AP ) 
The first birth - control pill meant to put a stop to a woman ’s monthly period indefinitely has won federal approval , the manufacturer said on Tuesday .
When taken daily , the pill , called Lybrel and made by Wyeth , can halt women ’s menstrual periods indefinitely and prevent pregnancies .
It is the latest oral contraceptive approved by the Food and Drug Administration to depart from the 21 - days - on , 7 - days - off regimen that had been standard since birth - control pill sales began in the 1960s , and is the first made to put off periods altogether when taken without a break .
Wyeth , based in Madison , N.J. , plans to start Lybrel sales in July .
The company said it had not determined a price .
The pill contains a low dose of two hormones already widely used in birth - control pills , ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel .

( Illustration / Christophe Vorlet Graphic ) Urban puzzle
The gentrification of rundown city neighborhoods conjures an image of well - off whites displacing poor minorities .
What 's actually going on is far more complex , and the winners and losers can be hard to predict .
In the 1990s , Boston had a face lift .
Gentrification arrived and proceeded at full steam in places like South Boston and Dorchester , where decades of poverty and economic stagnation had created landscapes of blighted homes and minimal commercial development .
Orchard Gardens , Commonwealth , Franklin Field , Harbor Point :
These new communities of town homes and condominiums replaced Boston Housing Authority housing " projects . "
Property values around these developments and entire neighborhoods became attractive once again .
Today , these areas are attracting middle - class homeowners , small - business entrepreneurs , and others who may not have viewed these areas as worthy of investment .
As in other major American cities , gentrification in Boston is an ad - hoc process ; government does n't necessarily coordinate all of the redevelopment , nor can one predict which areas will become hot markets .
Nevertheless , Boston did plan in advance by drawing on federal legislation -- most prominently , the HOPE VI Program -- to demolish its severely distressed public housing stock and then initiate a broader revitalization effort .
When government and private funds are involved , the financial arrangements supporting redevelopment can grow complex , but the objectives are straightforward : Begin by de-concentrating poverty -- that is , get rid of the projects -- and then rebuild on a smaller - scale in ways that combine multiple uses and diverse populations .
Any urban development strategy will be politicized because of the money at stake and the likely displacement of the powerless ( from both the neighborhood and the money game ) .
But in the Northeast and Midwest , revitalization is a particularly thorny process .
In post -Civil Rights era Boston , Providence , Baltimore , Detroit , Chicago , and St. Louis , the situation has grown even more complicated because blacks and Latinos have made great strides -- in government and in business .
The conventional view of urban politics can no longer be succinctly captured as whites dominating minorities :
Those calling for gentrification are equally likely to be ethnic minorities with political and commercial capital .
The long - held truism of gentrification -- namely that inner-city residents and their leadership will vocally oppose the redevelopment of their neighborhoods -- needs revision .
If white - black conflicts are no longer the most salient , what are the main lines of enmity and alliance ?
Several social scientists are helping to make sense of the emerging landscape of race and politics in the contemporary American city , where the old social divisions have been reconfigured .
Their work reveals that gentrification is still contested and economic development does not end up benefiting everyone , but predicting the winners and losers is getting harder .
Minorities may be on the winning side more often than not .
The senior and most eminent member of the group of sociologists examining gentrification is William Julius Wilson , university professor at Harvard .
Wilson has been writing about the plight of the urban poor for three decades .
" There Goes the Neighborhood , " his most recent study ( written with Richard P. Taub ) , analyzes four " working - and lower - middle - class Chicago neighborhoods " : African - American , white ethnic , Latino , and one in transition from white to Latino .
Drawing on the interviews and field notes of his graduate students , Wilson examines how ordinary residents react to urban redevelopment .
The main contribution of Wilson 's book may be to simply bring us up to date on the social and political fabric of the contemporary city .
For much of the 20th century , our views on political and economic development tended to emphasize racial and ethnic divisions .
Scholars and journalists usually looked at one ethnic group at a time , so it was not altogether surprising that our cities began to look like ethnic battlefields , with each group fighting for a share of the political and economic crumbs .
This may have been an accurate way of understanding the old urban political machines .
But Wilson 's work suggests that we need a new perspective when looking at the consequences of gentrification .
Wilson 's focus on struggling low - income and working families is also a nice counterpoint to the academic and popular reportage of the last decade , where the city can sometimes look like a playground for the rich .
In Wilson 's study , you wo n't find the commonplace infatuation with the fancy cuisine , services , and attractions of the so - called " global city . "
Nor is the working class treated solely in terms of their role as a cheap source of labor ( valets , janitors , nannies , etc. ) for the bourgeoisie .
Wilson shows ordinary Americans trying to eke out a place in a city that is changing around them .
Their concerns remain basic and their language is right out of the 1970s : Parents worry about poor kids being bused into their neighborhoods ; people want better crime prevention and improved city services .
Their concerns over redevelopment also remain basic -- they want affordable housing , lower property taxes , and limits on the number of public housing units constructed in their wards .
But , unlike the 1970s , the racial landscape appears more complicated because no one seems quite sure exactly who to trust , who to work with , and who the " enemy " is .
In such a climate , alliances never follow predictably .
In working - class Chicago , blacks and Latinos often work closely to build on shared interests and to put together initiatives that promote growth and development .
On the south side of the city , white politicians are adapting by addressing the needs of the new Latino voters in their district .
The only view residents of all four neighborhoods share is a concern over " prevalence of crime and other social dislocations in nearby black ghetto neighborhoods . "
Poor blacks get blamed by everyone .
Wilson 's emphasis on the unpredictable nature of racial politics in working - class neighborhoods reframes the contemporary perspective on gentrification , which has focused largely on the stormy conversion of poor neighborhoods to yuppie enclaves .
Lance Freeman , a professor at Columbia , further challenges this view , taking up the question of just how stormy this transformation actually is .
Freeman 's " There Goes the Hood " brings us into the homes of two gentrifying black communities in New York -- Harlem and Brooklyn's Clinton Hill .
Conventional wisdom holds that politicians and the property owners buying up dilapidated brownstones will pocket the winnings of gentrification .
But Freeman insists that we must listen to " indigenous residents " -- those living and working in the neighborhood before gentrification arrived -- if we want to find out who is affected ( and how ) by economic improvements .
Freeman shows that the commonplace view of economic development , namely that a gentrified neighborhood hurts blacks living there , is outmoded .
Inner cities are diverse spaces where the poor and homeless share streets with the black middle class and the black entrepreneur .
The popular lament over the horrible living conditions in the ghettos of the 1980s and 1990s failed to take into account those who were buying up property and establishing a productive presence during these tough years -- the working class , immigrants , and unionized workers who had well - paying jobs in transportation , parks , law enforcement , and other city agencies .
No one bothered to recognize that the ghetto had grown diverse over that time , even while staying overwhelmingly poor .
In both Harlem and Clinton Hill , Freeman found African - American store owners who struggled to stay afloat when the areas were depressed .
On the face of it , gentrification would raise their taxes and bring in economic competitors -- like fast food chains and retail outlets -- that could put them out of business .
But many end up thriving on the rising demand .
Many adjust well to the new business climate and their empowered stance actually helps them to improve their relations with the city government -- which comes to see the area as a tax boon , not a drain on the municipal coffers .
This is not to say that redevelopment does not create some divisions among neighbors who thought they had shared interests .
Freeman tends to downplay these animosities .
But it is hard to imagine that the indigenous shopkeeper and the franchise owner do n't argue on occasion , or that there is not discord among the white rehabber renting out the three - story brownstone and the black entrepreneur returning to buy a home in her childhood neighborhood .
To see how diversity creates strange and sometimes awkward bedfellows , we have to turn to Mary Pattillo 's " Black on the Block , " an in - depth sociological study of Chicago 's North Kenwood - Oakland ( NKO ) neighborhood , a historically poor and predominantly African - American community rapidly gentrifying .
Pattillo eschews most norms of social scientific objectivity by taking up residence in NKO .
She is a homeowner and secretary of a local neighborhood association with great influence over local development -- not to mention a Northwestern University professor .
Pattillo decides to stake her personal investment in a neighborhood that the city government and most financial institutions feel is still not a sure bet for short - or long - term improvement .
Pattillo acknowledges her complicated role , as both interested party and analyst .
But through her experience we see how complicated life can be for the black middle class .
In her neighborhood , Pattillo and other newly - arriving homeowners , many of whom find themselves sandwiched between empty lots and dilapidated , low - income housing projects , are caught between two motivations : the wish to live in an area with decent stores , well - maintained parks , and adequate city services ; and the ethical pull of advocating on behalf of those poorer blacks who might be displaced if the neighborhood continues to gentrify .
At one point in the book , Pattillo speaks up at a Community Conservation Council meeting convened to discuss the use of a proposed park .
Another member of the CCC wants to prevent " barbecuing " and " selling snow cones , " activities that some see as encouraging poorer residents to loiter and disrupt the leisurely strolls of middle - class users .
Pattillo dissents , standing up for her low - income neighbors .
But the consensus vote is against barbecues .
In this context , what is the responsible position of the black middle class ?
The question goes back at least to the 1890s , when W.E.B. DuBois wrote his seminal study of urban development , " The Philadelphia Negro . "
DuBois wrote that the indigenous and more cosmopolitan black middle class will forever oppose the newly arriving Southern migrant , unless the two recognize their conflicts only serve to strengthen the whites in power .
In some ways , Pattillo picks up where DuBois left off .
She cautions that , in Chicago , we must recognize that most whites will still not move into a black neighborhood .
And because they still face discrimination by financial institutions and real estate agents , the black middle class have few options of potential neighborhoods in which to live , and many of the potential sites are poor areas where they will displace their poorer counterparts .
This leaves blacks in a precarious position .
They end up becoming the public face lending support to redevelopment of ghettos and public housing demolition .
It is the black political leader who , when their neighborhood is on the upswing , advocates for protecting property values by demanding limits on low - income housing construction .
But although it is the black middle class moving in and buying real estate , the physical infrastructure of their neighborhoods is being rehabilitated by white - owned firms that get the lion 's share of the city contracts .
Thus , the net result is that middle - class blacks have become brokers , helping to ease the path of mostly white - controlled real estate firms that wish to reclaim undervalued inner-city neighborhoods .
White developers and politicians no longer need to suffer charges of racism .
Even though they recoup much of the revenue from construction , it is the black homeowner who will be the first to support economic improvements to their block -- perhaps not willingly , but what choice do they have if they want to live in a decent neighborhood ?
Taken together , the work of Wilson , Freeman , and Pattillo offers a more nuanced picture of gentrification .
Given the state of disrepair of US inner cities in the 1990s , it is not entirely shocking to find local voices supporting economic development and hoping to protect their investments .
Not many general truths can be gleaned , except perhaps that the impact of gentrification depends largely on a constellation of local factors -- some concrete , like the existing makeup of minority political power , and some more abstract , like patterns of metropolitan residential segregation .
We are left with a sobering look at the modern American metropolis , one still mired in the social obstacles and challenges that afflicted earlier generations .
And we find compelling evidence that race still matters in American society , although after reading these books , it is not always easy to predict exactly how .

Is there anything standing in the way of this “ Angolan Oil Miracle ? ”
Other than the majority of present and future oil production being locatdd in a small and ethnically separate territory , a territory with an active and violent independence movement , and with the budding capability to effectively disrupt oil production , no .
Angola is one of the few bright spots in global oil production — oil production is expected to increase by roughly 2 million barrels per day to around 3.4 mbpd within the next 10 years .
Angola has been wracked by civil war and violence since its independence from Portugal , with perhaps 1.5 million people dying in conflict .
That 27 year civil war ended , however , in 2002 , and Angola is generally seen as a relatively stable host for oil production , a perception that is further enhanced because the far - offshore , deep - water nature of most Angolan oil production makes it a difficult target for local groups with an axe to grind .
Through a quirk of colonial cartography , Angola includes the exclave province of Cabinda ( it was actually three independent African kingdoms who collectively asked the Portugese for protection from the Belgians ) .
And , to complicate matters further , the offshore territory controlled by Angola by way of this exclave is home to the most productive present and future oil fields — currently accounting for roughly 700,000 barrels per day of production , and home to many of the major production blocks currently making Western oil companies salivate .
Figure 1 : Map of Cabinda Exclave , with location relevant to Angola shown in inset .
Figure 2 : Cabinda 's offshore oil " Production Block O "
The situation with regards to the Cabinda exclave would be far less problematic if the people of Cabinda were happy participants in the “ Angolan Oil Miracle . ”
The huge royalties derived from Cabinda ’s oil production , however , flow directly to the Angolan capital of Luanda , with very little flowing back in the form of development funds .
This is especially significant considering that Cabinda has a population of only 300,000 people — that ’s nearly two barrels of crude produced per person , per day , with this number expected to increase significantly over the next few years .
The people of Cabinda understand that they should be among the wealthiest in Africa .
Instead , only 10 % of the oil revenues produced in Cabinda stay there -- in theory .
Because Angola has n't held elections in 14 years , and because provincial governments are appointed top - down from Luanda , the theoretical 10 % that " stays " in fact enriches the pockets of Angolan officials hand - picked for these luctrative positions ( see Ghazvinian , " Untapped , " pg. 154-65 )
Complicating the situation further , there is a long history of armed struggle for independence in Cabinda .
The FLEC ( Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda , or Cabinda Liberation Front ) and FAC ( Fuerzas Armadas de Cabinda , or Armed Forces of Cabinda ) have been longtime participants in Angola ’s past conflicts , and were the lone holdouts to the 2002 cease fire .
The Government of Angola claims that the FLEC & FAC signed a cease fire in the Summer of 2006 , but this is widely considered a sham by the people of Cabinda , and is disputed by the “ President ” of the “ Republic of Cabinda , ” Nzita Henriques Tiago .
Communiqués by various independence organizations from as recently as March , 2007 , suggest that this movement is very much alive .
John Ghazvinian , while visiting Cambida several months after the " cease fire , " reported that the armed conflict continued in the mountainous villages outside Cabinda City ( Ghazvinian , id . ) .
The Potential for a “ Nigerian - Style ” Oil Insurgency
What is the potential for the Cabinda insurgency to significantly impact the future oil output from Angola ?
While some major oil facilities are located ashore in Cabinda , the majority of oil infrastructure is far offshore ( See Figure 2 ) .
What are the probabilities that Cabinda will decide to target its own oil production as a means of gaining independence or autonomy ?
Do they have the tactical capabilities to carry out such a campaign ?
Are there any signs that this will happen ?
In analyzing these questions , I think the “ open - source ” model for learning in insurgencies is highly relevant .
Increasingly , due to better access to information and global communications , as well as lower barriers to entry for potential violent actors , insurgents around the world are using an open - source methodology to innovate in the areas of tactics and targeting methodology .
The effect of oil - infrastructure targeting in Nigeria , for example , is likely not passing unnoticed in the cafes of Cabinda .
Likewise , the tactical methods for attacking oil infrastructure — especially the developments in the tactics for attacking far - offshore infrastructure — are being effectively communicated “ open - source ” by the news media .
To the extent that tactical and targeting innovations are being made in Nigeria by groups like MEND , or other violent factions , they are available for adoption by insurgents in Cabinda .
Does this mean that insurgents in Cabinda have the means of disrupting the “ Angolan Oil Miracle ? ”
Probably not yet , but it seems likely that if more development funds and revenue sharing efforts are not advanced by Luanda , this combination of capability and intent cannot be far off .
In a troubling recent development , a Total oil platform in the Nkossa field ( in neighboring Congo , see Figure 2 above ) caught fire on May 10th .
There is insufficient evidence at this time to firmly establish the cause of the fire , but investigations have turned up a “ suspicious boat , its hull and body completely burned . ”
The result of the fire : 60,000 barrels per day are currently shut in , with no word on when the production will be restored .
Is this the opening salvo in a new Cabinda Oil Insurgency ?
It ’s far too early to tell , but one thing is certain : if the incident was not an intentional attack , it certainly publicized a potentially effective tactic to carry out such attacks .
Admittedly , the incident did not take place in Cabinda ’s “ Block O , ” but rather a few miles away in Congo ’s Nkossa field .
Ethnic groups in Africa do not tend to neatly conform to the borders laid down by former colonial masters — this may mean that there is an ethnic component to discontent in the region that has its sights set on both Brazzaville ( Congo ) and Luanda ( Angola ) , it may be a mere coincidence , or it may be a very intelligent tactical move :
One of the key limiting factors ( at least in the past ) to MEND ’s operations in Nigeria was the desire to maintain future production potential — it is possible that , IF this was an attack , it managed to inform Western companies operating in the region without damaging Cabinda ’s infrastructure , the revenues from which Cabinda hopes to one day enjoy .
I must concede : this is largely speculation at this point .
However , given the importance of increasing Angolan oil production to a world facing the onset of Peak Oil production , and given the success of inhibiting oil production in places like Nigeria , I think that this is highly important speculation .
This is yet another example of geopolitical feedback loops spawned by geological peaking in oil production .
The technical complexity of oil production off the coasts of Angola and Congo are well understood .
I , for one , have been generally unaware of the concomitant geopolitical complexities in the region .
Will the word “ Cabinda ” become as commonplace as the term “ MEND ” ?
It is certainly an area worth watching .
I wrote this article primarily to fill in my own knowledge gaps on this topic .
I hope that it has been equally useful to TOD readers -- there is no shortage of institutional knowledge to lean on here , as a quick search for " Cabinda " in the TOD archives shows that one reader had mortar shells land within 50 yards of him while in Cabinda .
Layoffs .
Downsizing .
Rightsizing .
Job cuts .
Separations .
Terminations .
Workforce reductions .
Off - shoring .
Outsourcing .
Whatever the term , getting rid of employees can be a necessary and beneficial strategic move for companies to make .
Layoffs can signal that a company is reorganizing and moving in a more profitable direction and , as a result , give Wall Street a reason to cheer and improve the morale of remaining employees .
But unless job cuts are handled and explained properly — and are indeed necessary to achieve a thoughtful , overarching purpose — the solution may cause as many headaches as the ailment it was meant to cure , according to Wharton faculty members and an outplacement expert .
Consider a recent move by Circuit City Stores , a big electronics retailer based in Richmond , Va .
The company announced on March 28 that it cut 3,400 jobs , or 7 % of its workforce , effective that day , because the salespeople were paid “ well above the market - based salary range for their role . ”
The company did not disclose specifics , but The Baltimore Sun reported that the laid - off workers , known as “ associates , ” made 51 cents more per hour above what the company had set as market wages .
Circuit City also announced that it had entered into an agreement with IBM to outsource its technology infrastructure operations , which would eliminate the jobs of 130 employees .
Fifty of these workers , however , were to be hired by IBM and remain on - site to serve the Circuit City contract .
These various moves , Circuit City said in a news release , were part of a “ series of changes to improve financial performance largely by realigning [ the company ’s ] cost and expense structure . ”
The decision to terminate the 3,400 employees was disclosed in the fourth paragraph of the release and described as a “ wage management initiative ” that led to the “ separation ” of the workers .
The job cuts “ focused on associates who were paid well above the market - based salary range for their role , ” the news release added .
“ New associates will be hired for these positions and compensated at the current market range for the job . ”
The company said , however , that the people who lost their jobs received severance packages and could reapply for their old jobs , at lower pay , but had to wait 10 weeks to do so .
The March 28 move , coupled with a decision made in February to realign Circuit City ’s retail structure by reducing the number of operating regions from 10 to eight , would save $ 250 million over the next two years , the company noted .
Peter Cappelli , management professor and director of the Center for Human Resources at Wharton , says Circuit City may have valid reasons for having to reduce costs , but the way it treated the 3,400 workers was highly unusual .
“ That ’s the most cynical thing I ’ve heard about in a long time , ” Cappelli says .
“ I like to think I ’m cynical , but sometimes it ’s hard to keep up . ”
According to Cappelli , Circuit City ’s decision to replace the terminated workers with lower - paid people is like saying : “ We made a mistake in compensation by paying them more than they were worth for their performance , so we ’re going to get rid of them . ”
Cappelli adds that he “ had never heard of that before .
Companies have always done sneaky things like getting rid of higher - wage workers with two - tier wage plans , but this … takes the cake . ”
A Once - Rare Occurrence
There was a time in the United States when large workforce reductions were few and far between .
An employee hoped — indeed expected — that his or her job would last for life , and often it did .
But layoffs have become so run -of - the - mill that even news editors sometimes pay them scant attention .
In an April 2 column , New York Times writer David Carr lamented the lack of coverage of the Circuit City job cuts .
His article was headlined : “ Thousands Are Laid Off at Circuit City .
What ’s New ? ”
According to Michael Useem , management professor and director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at Wharton , “ After waves of large - scale layoffs among American companies , most notably in the early 1990s , but again in the early 2000s in the wake of the dotcom bust , we have learned a lot about good practices and bad practices [ in eliminating jobs ] by watching companies in action . ”
Research has shown that if a company announces a downsizing without a broader reference to a strategic plan , its stock price will , on average , drop 5 % to 6 % over the next several days , according to Useem .
By contrast , if large - scale job cuts are announced as part of a broader restructuring , and a strategic plan is laid out , the firm ’s stock will rise some 4 % , on average , in the days following the announcement .
Useem says the research shows that , contrary to popular wisdom , Wall Street does not always welcome job cuts for their own sake .
“ The tough - minded , big institutional equity market is actually skittish and worried about downsizings that are simply short - term cost - cutting measures without a broader plan described behind them , ” Useem notes .
“ Investors are not beating the drum for downsizing as much as it is sometimes said they are .
It really is the restructuring they are applauding , not the particular method within it .
It ’s helpful to think about downsizing as restoration — cutting costs as a move to restore luster and performance . ”
Cappelli says , however , that Wall Street does sometimes support layoffs for their own sake .
“ If we define layoffs as being necessary because it makes sense to keep financial analysts happy , then it may make sense for companies to lay off people because analysts have a bias toward layoffs , ” he says .
“ They love layoffs because they immediately improve the bottom line .
They ca n’t easily assess what the long - term prospects of layoffs will be , but they can see immediate benefits . ”
Academic research , according to Cappelli , shows that layoffs usually have negative effects on a company ’s performance after the cuts take place .
“ But in fairness to companies that feel they have to cut jobs , part of the problem with the research is how the research is done , ” Cappelli adds .
“ Companies laying off people are , by definition , already in trouble .
So it ’s not surprising that if you select companies already in trouble [ for a research study ] , they look in worse trouble later . ”
It typically makes sense for a company to lay off workers only “ when it has a particular problem — excess capacity .
When you do n’t have excess capacity and you ’re cutting , you ’re cutting muscle . ”
Sending Signals
Wharton management professor Lawrence Hrebiniak says layoffs that are part of a restructuring can send a signal that a company is “ refocusing its use of scarce resources . ”
He likens such a move to investors who reallocate assets in their portfolios to move from poorly performing securities to more promising investments .
Downsizing can also send an important signal to customers , competitors , suppliers and Wall Street .
“ Years ago , Procter & Gamble cut thousands of jobs , ” Hrebiniak recalls .
“ They called it ‘ cost savings , ’ but the CEO also said P&G was sending a signal that this was a sign of a cultural revolution at P&G : to eliminate inertia , to wake people up to the focus on new markets and products and innovation , to get rid of dead wood .
So layoffs can represent a refocusing . ”
Robert E. Mittelstaedt , dean of the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University , notes that the stock market “ has more respect for [ job cuts ] if they are part of a broader plan .
Just signaling that you ’re going to cut costs and not saying anything else about what you ’re going to do does n’t impress people a whole lot . ”
In fact , Wall Street respects companies for divesting themselves entirely of unprofitable or barely profitable businesses rather than trying to strengthen them through large job cuts , because jettisoning unwanted businesses can make better strategic sense , according to Mittelstaedt .
“ There are times companies have to say that they believe exiting a business is right , ” Mittelstaedt says .
“ That gives a better signal to the market , as opposed to trying just to cut costs . ”
A March 26 story in The Wall Street Journal that Citigroup was in the process of finishing up a restructuring plan that will result in the elimination of some 15,000 jobs appears designed to achieve both short - and longer - term goals — to juice up the company ’s lagging stock price and to refocus the firm , according to Hrebiniak .
Citigroup reportedly wants to put more emphasis on its international operations and consolidate back - office functions .
“ He ’s getting pressure from shareholders , ” Hrebiniak says of Charles Prince , Citigroup ’s chief executive .
“ He ’s feeling no love .
He ’s got to show he ’s doing something to cut costs , improve margins , make some more money .
So it may not primarily be a move to restructure at all ; it could be a move to get critics off his back . ”
If Citigroup does decide to cut 15,000 jobs , it would represent nearly 5 % of its workforce of about 327,000 .
Adrian Tschoegl , a Wharton management lecturer who follows the banking sector closely , says the planned Citigroup layoffs have a strategic purpose : consolidating various functions that have grown redundant over the years and have become costly and difficult to manage .
He calls a 5 % workforce reduction far from draconian .
“ Citigroup has built up lots of bits and pieces over time , and it ’s a culture that tends to be combative , ” Tschoegl says .
“ Clients have been known to remark that Citibank ’s most tenacious competitors have been other Citibank units .
So this is a case of having a lot of bits and pieces and tidying things . ”
But cost - savings also play a big role in Citigroup ’s restructuring .
Tschoegl says the company could benefit , for example , by moving back - office functions from high - cost locations like New York to lower - cost operations in South Dakota and India .
In general , Tschoegl says , cutting jobs makes sense when a company is not only trying to reduce costs but also complexity .
One common way to achieve both goals is to outsource functions — such as security and janitorial services — to firms that specialize in such services .
In these cases , outsourcing can actually benefit janitors and security guards because they will be employed by firms that can offer them an upward career path in ways that a big corporation never could .
“ Where you get into trouble is if you simply cut heads across the board , ” Tschoegl warns .
“ Then you ’re not being sensible ; you ’re not getting rid of things that could be done better by somebody else ….
No company has ever gotten good by simply cutting . ”
Another risk is that a downsizing company can get rid of people whose knowledge and experience are vital .
Wharton management professor Daniel A. Levinthal points out that Circuit City ’s decision to cut 3,400 veteran sales people “ sounds like a massive de-skilling ” of the company .
Since the people who will be hired to replace the laid - off workers probably will not know the merchandise as well as the workers who were dismissed , customers who want to know how to set up a high - definition TV or why one music player is better than another might not receive the best advice .
If this is the case , Circuit City might have a hard time differentiating itself from its competitors .
“ These new people will be order takers and have less knowledge [ about the merchandise ] , ” says Levinthal .
“ Circuit City would now be competing against e-commerce because it ’s become similar to e-commerce and lost its differentiation as a bricks and mortar store . ”
As for the financial benefits associated with layoffs , Wharton accounting professor Wayne Guay says eliminating jobs can help a company financially in several ways .
One benefit is that labor expenses are lower and cash flow is higher in the current and following years simply because the firm does not have to pay as many people .
But layoffs do not necessarily allow a company to take a large write - off that can sharply reduce its tax liability for the year in which the job cuts take place .
Bad News in One Big Dose
Typically , it is best for a company that is downsizing to announce all the bad news “ in one fell swoop ” rather than in a “ series of smaller , separate , sequential layoff announcements , ” Useem notes .
“ Employees do n’t like the sequential approach — they do n’t like any downsizing , of course — but they like least the suffering of a thousand cuts .
The same thing is true for the stock market . ”
The way people are treated during a downsizing is a “ testament of the values and soul of a company , ” according to Useem , and firms should follow several steps that demonstrate to employees and the world at large that the firms practice good management principles .
First , companies should engage in as much transparency as possible , revealing as much financial information as they can to show the need for job reductions and help laid - off workers obtain retraining , outplacement assistance and resume - writing guidance .
Second , firms should work intensively with the employees who remain on the job because these people “ will be shell - shocked and fearful that they could be next , ” Useem says .
“ Gloom and anxiety are exactly the opposite of what companies need when they go through downsizing because they need to get more work done with fewer people .
Good morale is essential .
If top and middle management works with the people who remain , it can be a vital formula for ensuring that the people who are survivors get behind the new , leaner company , and achieve the results top management wants to achieve . ”
Regardless of the motivation behind , and execution of , layoffs , it is clear that they will continue to occur with almost drumbeat regularity .
“ The use of layoffs as a management tool to cut costs is widespread , ” says John Challenger , chief executive of Challenger , Gray & Christmas , a Chicago - based outplacement firm .
“ Virtually every Fortune 500 company has done it .
Only the absolutely most successful companies , [ whose ] profits have been consistently up , may have [ avoided ] them .
Layoffs have come to be expected by shareholders , and we are more and more in an environment where shareholders drive company actions . ”
If you want to understand this gathering storm , check out the Daily Mail , the Telegraph , the Spectator - even Tatler .
You could see it in the coverage last week of the private equity bosses hauled up before the Commons select committee to defend their paltry tax returns , or the news reports that " non doms " , those resident but not domiciled in the UK , do n't pay stamp duty .
" It 's not fair " is the indignant cry , and out tumbles a self - pitying litany of dispossession and deprivation .
The middle classes , normally a bastion of effortless entitlement , are feeling very hard done by .
It 's the struggle to scrape together the half a million required for a modest south - east house with some cash spare to pay the childcare ; the scramble for a half - decent school ; the prospect of pathetic pensions ; and the impossibility of easing their own children 's university debts , let alone their entry into the London housing market .
These last , assistance to the next generation , were key to how the middle class reproduced itself so successfully - but no longer .
Never have the middle classes looked so rich on paper - house values topping a million - and felt so poor .
As Lloyd Evans put it in a Spectator column last month after buying his first house : " In theory , we 're halfway to being millionaires .
Yet we do n't have a car , we can barely afford a holiday , and when we go for a drink , we sit on the green outside the pub , quaffing Tesco £ 2.99 Frascati to save money . "
What 's slowly dawning on middle England is that they 've been duped : they were sold a line - a " fair deal for hard - working families " ; meanwhile , another very different scenario was unfolding .
Britain became the world 's billionaire playground , attracting the super - rich with such a generous tax regime that in April the IMF went so far as to define the City of London as effectively a tax haven .
The wealth of Britain 's top 1,000 has quadrupled since 1997 and the rate of growth is now spiralling out of control - a massive 20 % jump in the past year .
Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have happily presided over an unprecedented golden age of wealth accumulation in this country - on a par with the US in Gatsby 's Roaring Twenties .
Yet the protests have been oddly muted - until now .
Except for complaints about soaring executive pay from dogged critics , there has been a peculiar tolerance of Britain 's super - rich elite 's mushrooming wealth .
Why has n't Brown had the roasting he deserves for being so pusillanimous about closing the tax loopholes that enable these billionaires to pay less tax than their cleaners ?
Why was it left to a fully paid - up member of the super - rich , Sir Ronald Cohen , to warn that the widening gulf of inequality could lead to riots in the streets ?
This bizarre tolerance is revealing : huge wealth is now regarded as a fabulous spectator sport and massively enviable .
It is also , most importantly , regarded as legitimate - the global economy is akin to a vast lottery , some just get lucky .
The " winner takes all " has become a respectable formula of economic life , not evidence of a systemic injustice .
Any other view is dismissed , in that derogatory phrase , as the " politics of envy " .
Peter Mandelson summed it up in 1998 with a magnificent use of adjectives : " We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich . "
The wealth may be obscene but the means of achieving it are presumed , naively , not .
This wealth is perceived as victimless - not achieved at the expense of someone else 's exploitation , but as a product of the near mystical vagaries of global stock markets .
To still any incipient protest , the Treasury championed the claim that this wealth benefited Britain - it resorted to that widely discredited fiction of the Thatcherite years , that wealth trickles down .
No Treasury review has ever attempted to prove this economic benefit to the country ; this is an issue on which myths abound .
But the worm has turned .
What " trickle down " means is massive inflation in the London housing market - which , in turn , drives the entire nation 's housing market .
Prices are being sharply skewed by an elite who are prepared to pay ludicrous money , and , insult to injury , manage to evade stamp duty - that bete noire of the property - obsessed - by transferring ownership of the property to an offshore company ( another tax dodge ) .
What infuriates the middle classes is not just the injustice , but that they are now priced out of the neighbourhoods they grew up in , and forced into near - unmanageable mortgages to cling on - hence the cheapo Frascati , taking your own lunch into work , the love of Ikea , Primark and Lidl .
Some of you old class warriors will be saying poor diddums to the middle - class whingers who are still doing substantially better than the hefty , and increasing , chunk of the population living in absolute poverty - now running at 7.4 million .
But do n't scorn such useful allies ; if the " hard - working families " of middle England can be recruited to campaign for a hike in tax rates for the rich ( say , those with annual incomes over £ 100,000 ) and closure of tax loopholes , Brown might actually do something .
The charge sheet is being assembled .
A super - elite rachets up social comparisons , leaving everyone lower down the pecking order disgruntled - the US economist Robert Frank argues that the relationship between inequality and lower rates of happiness is now well established .
His new book , Falling Behind , examines the phenomenon in the US , where the middle classes are now working harder than ever to pay exorbitant mortgages on incomes that have stagnated while the wealth of the super - rich has ballooned .
" Richistan " is another country , argues a Wall Street reporter assigned to cover the subject full - time in 2003 : private banking , private planes , private health and education .
And it 's a country stuffed full of absurd opulence - watches worth hundreds of thousands , but hey , why stop at one , what about a " watch wardrobe " ?
We are as ghoulishly gripped by Richistan as if we were watching a car crash - and that 's exactly what it is .
A slow - motion catastrophe : an elite , however small , with this kind of immense wealth has a hugely disproportionate impact , skewing the whole frame of reference in a society of value , worth and status - which are all human needs basic to dignity and wellbeing .
The super - rich are poison to the body politic , racheting up social tensions - most acutely in London , the global capital of Richistan - and those tensions , tragically , play out on the streets not of Belgravia but in the poorest neighbourhoods .

Climacs attempts to improve on the concepts found in other free Common Lisp - based emacsen , , such as Goatee ( the original editor component of McCLIM ) or Portable Hemlock .
Many design choices of Climacs are based more on the editor of the Genera operating system , Zmacs , and the other original Lisp emacsen , such as Hemlock , than on GNU Emacs .
Climacs is free software , released under the LGPL ( version 2 or , at your option , any later version ) .
Climacs contributes a few important things that are not found neither in Goatee nor in Portable Hemlock :
A buffer protocol with a potentially very efficient implementation based on flexichains ;
An " undo " protocol that is both general and powerful and that works on top of the buffer protocol ;
An implementation of the association between multi-keystroke gestures and commands using nested CLIM command tables ;
The possibility of having the buffer contain arbitrary objects .
These will be rendered by the CLIM `present ' function , so that they become clickable in the right context ;
Syntax highlighting in the form of incremental parsers , especially for Common Lisp code .
Climacs is not yet ready for prime time as a complete replacement for GNU Emacs .
Climacs is quite capable as a Common Lisp editor , though .
If Swank is available ( or loadable through ASDF ) when Climacs is loaded , Climacs will automatically use the Swank functions to provide useful assistance when you are writing Common Lisp code ( symbol completion , hyperlinking of compiler notes to source code locations , parameter hinting , definition finding , etc ) .
For better integration of Climacs into other CLIM applications , take a look at the CLIM - desktop - project .
Patches for Climacs are very welcome .
There is currently a lot of low - hanging fruit in the form of Emacs commands and functions that need to be reimplemented for Climacs .
Knowledge of the CLIM command system and being able to read the existing command definitions is all that is required .
See How to contribute below .
Installing Climacs is fairly easy ( the hardest part is tracking down the dependencies ) , please see the INSTALL file in the CVS archive .
Also , a CVS dump of Climacs from 2006 / 05/04 is installable via ASDF - install ( see the Cliki- page ) .
It is recommended to use the version in CVS , however .
Once loaded , Climacs is started by typing ( climacs : climacs ) at the Lisp REPL .
Climacs depends on a CVS version of McCLIM , Flexichain , and , conditionally , Swank ( part of SLIME ) .
Climacs will load and work properly without Swank , but its ability to help with the editing of Lisp code will be greatly diminished .
There is some incomplete Texinfo - based user documentation in the Climacs distribution .
See the file Doc/climacs-user.texi .
Also , some of the usual on - line Emacs help commands ( such as C-h f , C-h k and C-h w ) work in Climacs .
For developer - documentation , see Publications below , as well as the file Doc/ climacs - internals .
texi in the distribution .
Additionally , the chapter in the McCLIM manual about Drei also contains useful information .
These manuals may or may not be slightly out of date .
Note that Climacs is an Emacs - like editor , and a lot of keybindings are the same , so if you are familiar with Emacs , you should be able to reuse most of your knowledge .
One thing that is different , though , is that commands look " Like This " and not " like - this " , that is , they are english words instead of Lisp symbols .
This is a list of screenshots showing various Climacs features in action Description Image Images being moved around like any other buffer object Symbol - completion in Lisp syntax mode A Common Lisp source file with syntax - highlighting and parenthesis - matching A file open without syntax - highlighting Climacs just after startup
The following screenshots are somewhat old , and may not represent the current state of Climacs .
Climacs is a full CLIM application , and should take advantage of CLIM as much as possible , in particular for completion , presentations , etc .
Climacs employs a number of fairly well - defined protocols and internal API 's , some of which are documented in the Climacs Internals manual ( see Documentation ) and others that are described by comments in the source code .
It is hard to resist the temptation to re-implement functionality that is currently in Emacs but that really belongs either in CLIM or in separate CLIM applications .
In particular , we are not interested in :
Mail and News readers ( see mel , Hermes and Stamp ) ;
A debugger ( see the debugger pane of McCLIM ) ;
An inspector ( see the inspector pane of McCLIM , affectionately known as Clouseau ) ;
Dired , Bufed , Shell mode , Calendar and other functionality that is best done as a CLIM pane or a separate CLIM application .
We ARE however interested in the following items :
A grammar checker based on an incremental parser for natural languages
Incremental parsers for programming languages other than Common Lisp
Indentation warnings for Common Lisp
Additional commands for editing text .
It would also be nice to have someone flesh out the documentation .
Additionally , Climacs is based on a number of other libraries , and improving them may help Climacs .
Climacs is a CLIM application , and the favoured CLIM implementation is the free McCLIM .
Hence , any improvements of McCLIM will indirectly benefit Climacs .
Most of the functionality Climacs needs from CLIM is already provided by McCLIM , but a flexible interface for talking to other programs will be necessary if we want Climacs to talk to , for example , debuggers and Listeners .
Climacs makes use of a CLIM library , called ESA , that provides an Emacs - style UI , rather than the normal CLIM UI .
ESA supplies a new command loop , and enables support for chained gestures ( such as C- x C-f ) and macros .
Since improvements to ESA will benefit other ESA - using CLIM applications ( such as Gsharp , a score editor ) , any feature that can be moved to ESA probably should .
Conversely , improvements to ESA , for example in the on - line help system , will directly benefit Climacs .
Climacs uses an editor substrate provided by McCLIM , called Drei .
Drei was based on earlier Climacs code , but has been refactored to function as a general editor substrate , used , for example , to implement the text - editor gadgets and input-editor of McCLIM .
This means that many possible improvements to Climacs will have to be done by enhancing Drei .
Also , this means that the Drei documentation covers parts of Climacs , and should be the primary source of documentation for the protocols used in Climacs .
Most typical editor commands one might want to add to Climacs probably belong in Drei proper , so that they can be generally used everywhere , and not just in the Climacs application itself .

Robotic snail takes ceilings in its stride .
This robot loosely imitates a snail 's movements with five moveable parts on its artificial ' foot ' and clay in place of slime .
© AIP / MIT / Chan , B. et al
A robotic snail that can climb smooth vertical walls and traverse ceilings has oozed into action .
The mechanical mollusc was developed by a team of engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , led by Anette Hosoi .
They built the robot to test out mathematical models of how snails move and stay stuck to surfaces , but they also hope that robotic snails might one day find a use in the real world .
Land snails generally get around by contracting their single foot , which sits on top of a bed of sticky slime .
A region of compressed muscle travels from the back of the snail 's foot towards the front , while the snail 's attachment to the surface stops it from sliding backwards .
When the compression reaches the very front of the foot it is released , allowing the snail to stretch out to its full length , slightly ahead of its original position .
This allows the animal to inch forwards .
To loosely imitate this process , the artificial gastropod has five movable segments lined up on its underside .
One by one , each of these sections moves forwards along a track on the robot 's body .
After all five have advanced , the body itself slides forward , returning the segments to their original positions .
Good gel
The team tested out their snail on a tilting platform , covered with a 1.5 - millimetre - thick layer of slime made from Laponite , a type of clay that forms a clear , sticky gel when mixed with water .
As the engineers increased the incline , they saw that the snail took the hill in its stride , continuing to plod along even when the surface was vertical .
When the platform was flipped over so that the robot was upside down , it still made steady progress .
The secret to this gravity - defying stunt is apparently to keep the snail as light as possible ( just 31.6 grams ) , while ensuring that the Laponite has just the right stickiness .
They publish their findings in the November issue of Physics of Fluids1 .
Glue for you

So has the world been crying out for a robotic snail ?
" One can easily argue that snail locomotion is slow , slimy and inefficient , " admit the researchers in their paper .
But they also point out that because gastropods have only one foot , it is much easier to build mechanical analogues of snails than of two - footed people or four - footed animals .
And although they are slow , snails can crawl over pretty much anything , making them extremely versatile at getting around different environments .
The group has now developed mathematical models to come up with the optimum weight and slime characteristics for a robotic snail .
Hosoi says that these should help to build a second generation of robosnails that are much faster and more manoeuvrable .
Usenix
When security consultant Dan Klein was culling decades - old snapshots for his digital scrap book , he specifically omitted photos taken during his college years , when some of his behaviors were n't exactly role - model material for his offspring .
Left unscanned , for instance , was the picture of him wearing a tee - shirt bearing a marijuana leaf or another one showing him brandishing a six - inch switchblade while sitting in front of the pelt of an endangered animal .
Because the pictures were shot in the 1970s , preventing them from seeping into the digital ether was a trivial matter that required only that he keep them in the same musty closet that had been their home for years .
Klein 's secret was safe ... until now .
Contrast his experience with the students Penn State University students who rushed the football field in 2005 after a their team led a stunning defeat of Ohio State University .
Police investigating the disturbance were able to identify some suspects using images posted on Facebook , including some bearing the title " I Rushed the Field After the OSU Game ( And Lived ! ) . "
" We 're living at the dawn of a new age , or participating at the dawn of a new information age , " Klein said during a session at the Usenix Annual Technical Conference in Santa Clara , California .
" Whether it 's good or bad , whether it 's correct or incorrect , the data is preserved forever . "
Klein's 90 - minute talk was packed with plenty of other cautionary tales .
There was the Google search from Robert Petrick 's computer for " Body decomposition " and " neck , " " snap " and " break , " that helped lead to his conviction for the murder of his wife and the dumping of her body in a North Carolina lake .
Scott Peterson , who was convicted of murdering his wife and dumping her in the San Francisco Bay , was similarly implicated by a Google search , in his case for queries relating to tide schedules .
There was also the former nanny of a friend who maintained a blog on LiveJournal that volunteered that she was a survivor of child abuse .
The friend , acting in response to statistics that suggest past abuse is a strong predictor of future abuse , fired the woman .
Indeed , Klein himself has been snared by stale digital information that later got dug up .
In his case , the offending document was a PowerPoint presentation he gave for a Usenix talk years ago in which he discussed his experience providing technical support to a variety of adult - themed websites .
" In a lot of people 's minds , I 'm that porno guy , " he said .
The latter anecdote demonstrates how easy it is for digital information to be misconstrued .
Despite all the lessons about the inaccuracy of Wikipedia and other digital repositories , we still give a great deal of credence to what we see online .
The means even seemingly benign details can become liabilities if they are misrepresented .
Of course , search engine queries , blog postings and photo sharing are only a few of the ways personal data can leak out in ways we never intended .
RFID tags are already being embedded in passports , and laws have already been proposed to put them in driver 's licenses .
Given technologies that extend the range at which tags can be read , Klein said , it 's not a stretch to imagine readers being installed in doorways , roadsides , walls and other places and having our comings and goings monitored .
" Once you know where somebody is , you can do correlations , " Klein said .
" That is the greatest boon and the greatest threat of the information age . "
An example of a useful correlation : a reminder to renew an eyeglass prescription a few years following a visit to an optometrist that was logged by a mall 's RFID system .
More invasive is the report sent to the health insurance provider that the person just ate two jelly doughnuts at the cafeteria .

Python is Nearly Safe - or is it ?
I 'm sure that by now you 've seen the Joel Spolsky blog entry , Language Wars .
He debates the benefits of using ' safe and mature ' platforms for projects .
These debates are enormously fun and a total and utter waste of time , because the bottom line is that there are three and a half platforms ( C# , Java , PHP , and a half Python ) that are all equally likely to make you successful .
...
Python get a half because it's on the border , about to cross the line from an " interesting " choice to a " safe " choice .
Of Ruby he says :
Ruby is a beautiful language and I 'm sure you can have a lot of fun developing apps it in , and in fact if you want to do something non-mission - critical , I 'm sure you 'll have a lot of fun , but for Serious Business Stuff you really must recognize that there just is n't a lot of experience in the world building big mission critical web systems in Ruby on Rails , and I 'm really not sure that you wo n't hit scaling problems , or problems interfacing with some old legacy thingamabob , or problems finding programmers who can understand the code , or whatnot .
So while Ruby on Rails is the fun answer ... that 's not a safe choice for at least another year or six .
Needless to say the Ruby world is up in arms about this , which is especially fun for me because I work with two Ruby enthusiasts and can tease them about it .
Fredrik Lundh comments that just as Python is becoming generally recognised as a mature and safe platform , we 're about to break it .
Could he have a point ?
Possibly .
Will people looking for a long term development platform , be scared off by the choice between the Python 2.X series , which is soon to become ' apparently obsolete ' , and Python 3 , which will essentially be a new and untested platform ?
We shall see I guess .
IronPython , Threads and More GUI Pain
Ahh , the joys of threading .
Up until recently Resolver has been a basically single threaded application .
The main exception is the test suite , where we run the application on a separate thread to the tests so that we can interact with it even when it is blocked .
We also have the odd asynchronous callback ( implemented in .NET with a thread ) , but nothing too serious .
Today though , this might have all changed .
I say might , because the glorious fun that threads inevitably cause mean we have n't been able to check - in yet .
My colleagues will be delighted to read this , by the way .
They 're all away at the moment except for the two interns , so we 're busy causing devastation behind their backs .
It all started innocuously enough .
A simple user story to display a ' throbber ' style activity indicator when a document enters a potentially time consuming process .
We set up the ' enter processing ' and ' exit processing ' events fine , and got the throbber displayed and undisplayed when these were fired .
All that was left was to wire these events to the method that does the job .
Unfortunately , if it is being processed on the main application thread then it blocks the GUI from updating and you can't see the darn throbber anyway .
sigh
The obvious answer is to kick off the processing on another thread .
A mutex around the method should stop any potential risk of it being called simultaneously , and two threads is hardly multi- threaded so it should n't be too difficult right ?
Hmmm ...
The first problem was that the throbber needs to be enabled on entering the method , and then disabled on exiting .
The method is now non-blocking , so we can't just wait for it to exit and then disable , it has to be done from within the thread .
You can't access Windows Forms controls ( or interact with them anyway ) from another thread .
Luckily IronPython and .NET between them provide a way round this :
import clr
clr .
AddReference ( ' IronPython ' )
from IronPython .
Runtime .
Calls import CallTarget0
control .
Invoke ( CallTarget0 ( DisableThrobber ) )
DisableThrobber is a function that does the work .
The Invoke method on a control , causes the callable you pass in to be invoked on the thread the control is running on .
You have to use CallTarget0 so that IronPython can turn your callable into a delegate .
Fine ...
This is where it got fun for us .
This process can be kicked off when one of our controls loses the focus .
If the user has the focus in this control and then exits the application , then first there is a LostFocus event causing the process to kick off .
When this was all synchronous there was no problem , there would be a slight delay before the close dialog appeared , but we did n't realise this was happening .
So I guess it was a ' bug ' that was already there .
As it had no bad , or even visible , side effects ; we never noticed it .
Joy of joys , because this process is now run in another thread , the close dialog appears first which blocks the GUI thread .
The control .
Invoke is blocked until the dialog is left .
If you confirm your exit , the invoke is now happening on a control which has been disposed and everything blows up .
Hurrah .
This is where we left it and went home .
The fix should be simple , unwire the LostFocus event in the FormClosing event .
They are on different controls , managed by different adapters , so this is not quite trivial but still easy .
Well , we 'll find out tomorrow I guess .
The summary is that , yet again , what should have been a really simple job has spiralled .
double sigh
One alternative is to manage the throbber gif from another process altogether and just synchronise the positions .
Even threads are less evil than this though .
Python and Curly Braces
How long has this been in ?
A Busy Schedule
I 've got a lot of stuff on at the moment , particularly with the various Python projects I run .
For those of you who might be waiting for an update on any of these , this is a rough ordering of what I have to do :
Movable Python Write new documentation .
I am also intending to create distributions of SciPy ( and possibly other common extension modules ) especially for Movable Python .
ConfigObj
Fix a couple of bugs reported on sourceforge .
Add PEP 292 Interpolation Ensure ConfigObj is picklable Allow interpolation from the current section A minor change to allow ConfigObj to work with IronPython
rest2web
A new release is just sitting in subversion , waiting for documentation updates .
I also need to create a manpage .
I may also add a couple of additional features , like a new filemask keyword for the restindex and fix a bug that prevents you using hard tabs for indentation in the templates .
pythonutils
With a new version of StandOut just out , and hopefully a new version of ConfigObj by the time I get to this , it will be time to update pythonutils .
Should just be a case of putting together a new release .
Alongside this I am in discussion with Manning about a possible IronPython book .
It depends on whether they think there is sufficient market for one ( and whether or not I am the right person to write one ) , so it may never happen .
Stay tuned !
I also have several more entries in the IronPython tutorial that I have planned , but have n't yet done .
Unfortunately , amidst all this activity , Firedrop2 is being neglected .
Firedrop2 is a great blog client , and with a little more work could be even better .
Unfortunately it does all I need at the moment , so it is dropping off the bottom of my priority list .
All Our Code is Broken ( or Python 3000 is Coming )
Python 3000 is really on its way .
Guido's move to google has finally provided the spur ( or at least the time ) for real development to happen .
Python 3 k is no longer vapourware !
It even has its own mailing list and branch in the Python Subversion Repository .
You can see from Guido 's report on the recent google sprint some of the concrete work that has been happening to make Python 3 a reality .
So what 's the big deal ?
Well , Python 3 is the opportunity for Guido ( and the other Python core developers ) to fix what they ( and others ) see as mistakes in Python by breaking backwards compatibility with the Python 2.X series .
That means that in Python 3 terms , your code is probably broken .
If you look through PEP 3100 for everything marked ' to be removed ' , you might see some of your old friends disappearing or changing .
One of the major changes is that the unicode data - type will die .
In Python 3 all strings will be unicode and there will be a new data - type bytes for byte strings .
Opening a file in ' text ' mode will return a unicode string , and will rely on a new I /O layer for ' guessing ' the appropriate encoding of a text file .
This will actually make text handling a lot easier if you understand the basics of unicode .
You will still have problems if you want to load in an arbitrary file and treat it as text without knowing the encoding , but to be fair you already have this problem even if you 're not aware of it .
See this article on guessing text encoding for one approach to handling this .
Another controversial change is that print becomes a function rather than a keyword .
This change alone is enough to guarantee that all Python text books have to be rewritten and a huge proportion of code is just plain broken .
Personally , I think print feels like a keyword and that this is gratuitous breakage , but I 'm not in the mood to fight against the wind and there is a lot in Py3 k that is very good .
Guido sets out his reasoning here .
Part of his reasoning is , programs that use print are much harder to refactor to modify the behaviour of print .
For example to add logging .
Of course this can be done without any refactoring , by using an approach similar to StandOut .
StandOut modifies the behaviour of print , adding logging and filtering based on message priority , by making sys.stdout and sys.stderr a bit more ' clever ' .
Of course ' clever ' is not always a compliment in Python , and for a large application this kind of magic may not be appropriate .
However , it can be done without breaking everything ...
The advantage of this approach is that sys.stderr is diverted : so exception tracebacks are also logged without having to be explicitly handled ( and are logged even if your explicit handling fails ) .
A long time ago we were promised that there would be tools to help us migrate our code from Python 2.X to Python 3.X .
In recent discussions there was scant mention of these tools .
Some of my legacy code may fare better if quietly consigned to the annals of history , but I have not been looking forward to converting all the code that I did want to keep current .
Fortunately news of such a tool has surfaced from Jeremy Hylton .
It is a remarkably simple approach ( at least in theory , lots of detail to sort I imagine ) .
Code is parsed to an AST with a 2.X parser , and then transformed into a Python 3 AST ( or CST or whatever ) and rewritten .
Great !
It even looks like a tokenizer can be used to decorate the AST with the real tokens used in the original source .
This means that whitespace , comments , quotes and multiple lines may be able to be preserved in the ' re - generated ' code .
Very cool .
As a kind of last word , there is little you can do to try and keep your code ' Python 3 ' compatible whilst still writing for the current interpreter .
Python 3 does n't yet exist and the details are still being worked out .
Many of the changes will be syntax errors in Python 2 anyway .
StandOut 3.0.0 Released
There is a new release of StandOut , the flexible output object .
This version is a complete rewrite , with a full set of unit tests .
standout is a module that provides a single class : StandOut - the flexible output object .
It provides a simple way of adding logging to a program , and an easy way of adding verbosity levels .
By assigning a priority level to each message , it makes it trivially easy to allow your users to choose their own verbosity level .
Verbosity levels for normal output and the log file can be different .
Alternatively you can just use StandOut for logging stdout and stderr to a file .
As an added bonus it includes a software unbuffered mode .
In this mode all writes to stdout and stderr are flushed immediately .
Quick download links :
The zip file includes full documentation and unit tests .
See StandOut Homepage for the online documentation .
Basic usage , for logging all output on the standard output and standard error streams to a file :
from standout import StandOut
stout = StandOut ( ' log.txt ' )
print ' This will be logged to the file '
stout .
close ( )
StandOut is currently used in both Movable Python and rest2web .
Code Reuse
Plus a nifty bit of blog title re-use too .
I 've discovered a few of my modules are in use in other projects :
ConfigObj Configuration file reader and writer ( ini files ) , with an emphasis on ease of use and flexibility .
Flazzle A language flashcard program with both a commercial and an Open Source version .
PyKeylogger
A key logger !
I hope this has nothing to do with the Python Virus .
Dynagen Dynagen is a text front - end to Dynamips , a Cisco 7200 emulator written by Christophe Fillot .
It emulates a 7206 hardware platform , and runs standard 7200 IOS images .
scraper.py
A simple HTML scraper class , for easy parsing of dirty HTML .
Rather than presenting the structure of the HTML as an object , it provides methods to override for processing the HTML as it is being parsed .
Cedar Hepforge
A development environment for high energy physics software development projects .
Hepforge uses scraper.py in the CEDAR project .
akismet .py
This modules provides a Python interface to the Akismet comment spam blocking web service .
The Trac Spamfilter Plugin has taken this module and adapted it .
It still bears more than a passing resemblance to my code , and they were nice enough to credit me .
Commercial software and a keylogger !
Serves me right for the lax license terms .

People seek ways to lose weight for a number of reasons .
They could be healthy but they weigh more than the ideal indication .
Their intentions are to prevent from getting into health problems that can be caused by over - weight .
Or , they have no other choice because they have already developed complications such as diabetes or heart disease as a result of the extra weight they have .
“ If we exercise hard enough , we can lose weight faster . ”
This is the impression that most people will have .
But , in reality , exercising intensely may not necessarily be effective in losing weight .
It is believed that if our heart rate is kept at 60 to 70 percent of its maximum rate during exercise , we will be converting relatively more fat than carbohydrates into energy .
However , if we exercise with a heart rate more than 70 percent of the maximum , more carbohydrates rather than fat will be burnt .
Although our cardiovascular fitness will be higher than someone exercising at a slower heart rate , we will be burning less fat and thus losing less weight .
As a rule of thumb , your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age .
Although the proportion of fat burnt at higher exercise intensities is less relative to carbohydrates , the absolute amount of fat that is burnt is still higher than the amount of fat burnt at lower intensities , since the overall rate of energy expenditure is higher .
Hence , you will burn actually fat at a substantial rate if you exercise at high heart rates .
Besides intensity , duration will also determine whether the exercise is effective .
If you are able to exercise at a high heart rate for a long time , you will utilize a lot of fat .
This does not mean that high - intensity exercise is advisable for those desperate to lose that flab .
Most people are unable to exercise intensely for a long period of time .
The key is then to strike a balance between intensity and duration .
It is recommended to exercise at a level where calories can be burnt at a substantial rate .
For most people , this balance is achieved at an intensity of 70 percent of the maximum heart rate – the ideal pace for burning a good proportion of fat .
Your total expenditure will not be high if you push yourself to 95 percent of your maximum heart rate , then stop 5 minutes later due to fatigue .
But this should not be taken as an excuse to slack off on your exercise regime .
Exercising too lightly can cause you to pack on those pounds .
To lose weight , we need to incur an energy deficit , forcing the body to remove and burn body fat to make up for the deficit .
This deficit should be substantial , because if it is small , the body can compensate by lowering the metabolic rate to conserve energy to the extent that it does not even have to draw on the body fat .

Remember the buzz about anonymous commenters damning their luck that the attempt in Afghanistan on VP Dick Cheney ’s life was unsuccessful ?
In fact , several commenters on my post yesterday about Donald Rumsfeld ’s recent hospitalization have accused me of wishing the former Secretary of Defense dead .
Well , in the spirit of tit for tat , I call your attention to Glenn Greenwald ’s blog post on responses at the major conservative blog Little Green Footballs to news that among the many — too many — things that KSM has confessed to was a plot to assassinate Carter .
( How old is this guy ? )
Greenwald ’s post is worth reading in its entirety , but here are a few of the choicest comments :
Can we furlough him–just so he can realize the Carter plot ?
Please ?
/ Is this wrong ?
Can we trade Carter to get the WTC and it ’s occupants back ?

Can we trade Carter to get the WTC and it ’s occupants back ?
Yes .
Absolutely .
We wo n’t get them back in the trade , but we will have gotten rid of Carter , so there is still a net benefit .
Really , why would Islamic terrorists plan to kill Jimmy Carter … the man is their best friend .
“ Mohammed also admitted to planning assassination attempts on former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter . ”
Even this schmuck had some good ideas .
Here are some supporting the torture that almost certainly , err , facilitated KSM ’s catch - all confessions :
But they got those confessions through torture !
And worse than that , they probably hurt his feelings too .
They probably gained those confessions through brutal torture – you know , panties on the head and all .
Little Green Football ’s blogger - in - chief Charles Johnson has already blocked the link from Greenwald ’s post ( which took time , Greenwald points out , that Johnson could have used to delete the comments ) , so check them out before they ’re gone .

The Christmas Wars / Christmas Dilemma Events during 2006 Sponsored link .
Overview :
The conflict over Christmas in 2006 started to heat up well in advance of the holiday , as in past years .
The root of the debate is a conflict over whether to acknowledge and value religious diversity in America :
Some people regard late December as a multi-cultural time when North Americans should acknowledge the beliefs and practices of various religious faiths and secularists .
These include Christians , Wiccans , Muslims , Jews , Atheists , secularists , etc. , as they enjoy observing their unique seasonal days of celebration .
They assert that they have nothing against observing Christmas .
However , they want celebrations of other faith groups and unbelievers to be recognized as well .
Others believe that , among all of the religious and secular celebrations in late December , only a Christian celebration of Christmas should be acknowledged and recognized .
Still others have a heightened concern about the separation of church and state during this season .
2006 - OCT : InterFaithFamily.org conducts survey : InterFaithFamily.org publishes " helpful , welcoming articles about interfaith families exploring Jewish life .
They conducted a December Holidays Survey during 2006 - October among 759 people , most of whom were Jewish or had a Jewish partner .
Some results : 99 % planned to celebrate Hanukkah .
93 % planned to exchange gifts at Hanukkah .
89 % planned to celebrate Christmas .
78 % plan to keep Hanukkah and Christmas celebrations separate .
44 % planned to decorate a Christmas tree. 18 % plan to attend Christmas religious services .
5 % planned to tell the Christmas story .
12 NOV - 09 : USA : Wal - Mart restores " Merry Christmas " greeting : Having suffered a loss of sales as a result of the 2005 boycott by the American Family Association , the Catholic League and other conservative Christian groups , Wal - Mart has decided to revert to the greeting " Merry Christmas " instead of " Happy Holidays . "
Wal - Mart spokesperson , Linda Blakley , told USA Today : " We , quite frankly , have learned a lesson from last year .
We 're not afraid to use the term ' Merry Christmas . '
We 'll use it early , and we 'll use it often . "
They plan to show TV ads starting in mid-November promote " Christmas . "
It 's changing the name of its seasonal decorations department to " The Christmas Shop " from " The Holiday Shop . " 2 NOV - 15 : USA : Alliance Defense Fund mobilizes 950 attorneys : On 2006 - NOV - 15 , the Alliance Defense Fund ( ADF ) announced that it has over 950 attorneys available across the U.S. to combat the censorship of Christmas celebrations in schools and public property .
However , they plan to fight only " improper attempts " to restrict celebrations .
This implies that there are certain restrictions that are legitimate and required by the U.S. Constitution .
ADF President Alan Sears said : " Frankly , it 's ridiculous that Americans have to think twice about whether it 's okay to say Merry Christmas .
Thanks to the ACLU and its allies , Christmas is n't what it used to be .
It 's time to repair the damage that such organizations have done to America 's favorite holiday .
An overwhelming majority of Americans oppose censoring Christmas .
...
It 's a sad day in America when you have to retain an attorney to wish someone a Merry Christmas .
The fear , intimidation , and disinformation spread by the ACLU and its allies over the years will not be changed overnight .
That 's why ADF wants to dispel the myths about religious expression at Christmastime that have prompted wrongful acts of government censorship of religious speech . "
In their news release , they appear to recognize that a simple , government - sponsored religious displays -- Christian or otherwise -- are not permitted , and that the content of displays must meet certain standards in order to be constitutional .
They write : " Often , the ' Three Reindeer Rule ' is used by courts , whereby a judge reasons that having a sufficient number of secular objects in close enough proximity to the Christmas item ( such as a crèche ) renders the overall display as a constitutional community observance of the holiday . "
1 Mid November : WA : Rabbi asks for menorah at Seattle - Tacoma airport :
The origins of this story began in October .
Mitchell Stein , a Jew , is a construction consultant for the Port of Seattle .
He offered to supply the Port Authority with a large , 8 feet tall , menorah to be installed in the airport 's international arrival hall .
It would be located beside the many Christmas trees that the airport sets up each December .
He was never able to get a clear answer from the airport staff about his request .
Orthodox Rabbi Bogomilsky attempted to resolve the issue .
He had his attorney sent a letter to the Port Authority .
The letter allegedly mentioned the possibility of a lawsuit if the menorah was not added to the seasonal display .
He said : " Everyone should have their spirit of the holiday .
For many people the trees are the spirit of the holidays , and adding a menorah adds light to the season . "
Airport staff decided that if they added a Jewish menorah , they would have to also be open to adding symbols of other religions and cultures in the area .
But if they did not add the menorah , then they might be sued .
They decided to resolve the problem by removing all of the Christmas trees and having no decoration for the holiday season .
Harvey Grad , Bogomilsky 's lawyer , said : " They 've darkened the hall instead of turning the lights up .
There is a concern here that the Jewish community will be portrayed as the Grinch [ who stole Christmas ] . "
Airport maintenance workers removed the trees on early Saturday morning , DEC - 09 .
Airport spokesperson Terri-Ann Betancourt said : " We decided to take the trees down because we did n't want to be exclusive .
We 're trying to be thoughtful and respectful , and will review policies after the first of the year . "
6 Later developments NOV - 25 : CO : Homemaker threatened with fine for Christmas wreath : Lisa Jensen of Pagosa Springs , CO decided to decorate her house with a Christmas wreath .
Showing innovation , she created a novel wreath in the form of a peace symbol , with a red ribbon at the bottom .
Her homeowners association went ballistic .
They called it " politically divisive " and a " symbol of Satanism . "
3
The latter was a common view back in the late 20th century among conservative Christians .
In fact , the peace symbol was derived from an overlapping of the two international semaphore symbols for the letter " N " and " D . "
The symbol was designed by Gerald Holtom for the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament back in the 60s .
The " N " and " D " stand for " nuclear disarmament . "
4 Jensen was threatened with a $ 25.00 per day fine until she removed the wreath .
She refused , saying : " It seems whenever someone tries to say ' Peace on Earth ' it is met with so much resistance .
The incredible amount of support we have received over the last couple of days really is proof to us of how many people believe in peace and in our right to say it . "
Hundreds of strangers offered to pay her fine .
She told the Associated Press her display was not political , saying : " Peace is way bigger than not being at war .
This is a spiritual thing . "
Eric Rauch , who is opposed to the display , commented on the American Vision web site : " It was n’t that the association banned wreaths or outdoor decorations of any kind ; they viewed Jensen ’s wreath as a political — or even worse — a religious , statement .
The peace wreath was deemed ' divisive , ' and since the association ' does n’t allow flags or signs that are considered divisive , ' the obvious decision was to demand removal of the festive monstrosity . "
" To her credit , Jensen was not put off by the association .
A past president herself , Jensen knew her rights and stood her ground .
She insisted the wreath was neither a political , anti-war statement nor a shrine to the ' evil one . '
She said the wreath was simply a way to proclaim the hope that she shares with every Miss America contestant : world peace .
After she received overwhelming support from the Pagosa Springs community , the homeowners association backed off and claimed that the whole affair was a misunderstanding .
I guess it was … and it still is .
By caving in and allowing the wreath to stay , the association is revealing just how out of touch they are with the rest of the country . "
NOV - 28 : Christian triumphalism doing well in Colorado :
In 2005 - DEC , the council had refused the request of the Chabad Center of Northern Colorado to display a 9 - foot - tall menorah next to a Christmas tree in its town square .
Rabbi Gorelik of the Center was permitted to light the nine - branched candelabrum in Old Town Fort Collins , and then move it quickly to a local pub : CooperSmith 's Pub & Brewing .
It appears that the same arrangement will be implemented in 2006 .
During 2006 - JUL , Fort Collins ' city council decided to limit seasonal displays to Christmas trees , wreaths and white lights .
On NOV - 28 , a group of church leaders from the local Inter Faith Dialogue Group sent a letter to council noting that the city seems to be showing a bias in favor of only one religion -- Christianity .
They suggested that the council either allow symbols of all faiths , or ban religious objects entirely .
The council continued its previous policy .
Fort Collins Mayor Doug Hutchinson hopes the council will reconsider its decision and allow multi - faith displays .
He said : " Great cities are inclusionsary and I hope Fort Collins becomes inclusionary . "
Some members of council believe that Christmas Trees are not a Christian symbol , and that by allowing only Christmas trees , the city is thus banning all religious symbols .
14,15 NOV - 28 : IL : Ad for a film " The Nativity Story " prohibited at Christmas festival : New Line Cinema prepared a short TV advertisement for its new movie " The Nativity Story . "
They arranged to have it continuously displayed at a downtown Christmas festival , the German Christkindmarket in Chicago , IL .
The city banned the ad saying that it might offend non-Christians .
Paul Braoudakis , spokesperson for the Barrington , IL - based Willow Creek Association , a group of more than 11,000 churches of various denominations , said : " The last time I checked , the first six letters of Christmas still spell out Christ .
It 's tantamount to celebrating Lincoln 's birthday without talking about Abraham Lincoln . "
Cindy Gatziolis , a spokesperson for the Mayor 's Office of Special Events said that the city does not want to appear to endorse one religion over another .
" Our guidance was that this very prominently placed advertisement would not only be insensitive to the many people of different faiths who come to enjoy the market for its food and unique gifts , but also it would be contrary to acceptable advertising standards suggested to the many festivals holding events on Daley Plaza . " ]
Fox News , quoting Christina Kounelias , an executive vice president at New Line Cinema , reported that : ] " Kounelias said she finds it hard to believe that non-Christians who attended something called Christkindlmarket would be surprised or offended by the presence of posters , brochures and other advertisements of the movie .
' One would assume that if ( people ) were to go to Christkindlmarket , they 'd know it is about Christmas , ' she said . "
DEC - 08 : DC : Annual White House holiday card does n't mention Christmas :
For the second consecutive year , the White House 's " holiday card " does not mention Christmas .
7 Undated : Vision America petition to President Bush : Vision America is a fundamentalist Christian group attempting to restore " the original American vision " by " mobilizing pastors and churches to win the war on Christianity . "
8
They note that the ACLU and " activist ' judge who enforce the First Amendment 's separation of church and state have " assaulted " " public displays celebrating Christmas . "
We have never seen any evidence of such an assault , although the ACLU and other groups have often initiated lawsuits to have religions other than Christian represented at municipal and school displays at this time of year .
Vision America has issued a petition to President Bush asking him to issue an executive order " prohibiting the federal enforcement of any court decisions that seek to remove Christ from Christmas . "
The effect would be to trigger a constitutional crisis between the executive branch .
9
Their web site sells printed cards to people who object to " Happy Holidays . "
They say : " Like 90 % of the American people , we celebrate Christmas in our home .
Since businesses derive 20 % of their annual income from Christmas Shopping , -- the greeting ' Merry Christmas ' would be appreciated .
Thank you for considering this request . "
10 They also sell bumper stickers that say : " It 's OK to say ' Merry Christmas ' . "
11 2006 - DEC - 12 : Christmas trees reinstalled at Seattle - Tacoma airport : Officials at the Seattle - Tacoma airport learned on DEC - 11 that Rabbi Elazar Bogomilsky 's organization would not file a lawsuit over the Christmas tree display .
His lawyer , Harvey Grad , said : " We are not going to be the instrument by which the port holds Christmas hostage .
He mentioned that the rabbi had received " all kinds of calls and e-mails , " many of which were " odious . "
Local Jewish organizations also began receiving hate Emaikls .
Bogomilsky wrote on behalf of Chabad of Greater Seattle : " For many people , the Christmas tree is an important symbol of the season .
Our goal was to include a menorah in the airport as well so that we could bring extra light with Hanukkah 's universal message of hope .
Our discussion of possible legal action was never about removing Christmas trees - it was about protecting the right to add menorahs . "
Patricia Davis , president of the Port of Seattle commission , issued a statement saying that Rabbi Elazar Bogomilsky : " ... never asked us to remove the trees ; it was the port 's decision based on what we knew at the time .
...
A key element in moving forward will be to work with the rabbi and other members of the community to develop a plan for next year 's holiday decorations at the airport . "
Fourteen plastic Christmas trees , and zero menorahs were installed at the airport during the early morning of DEC - 12 .
13 2006 - DEC - 19 : The lucrative business of keeping Christ in Christmas : Daniel Burke of the Religious News Service wrote an article about the financial benefits to conservative Christian groups who are fighting the Christmas War .
He wopte : " The Mississippi - based American Family Association says it has sold more than 500,000 buttons and 125,000 bumper stickers bearing the slogan ' Merry Christmas : It 's Worth Saying ' . "
" The Alliance Defense Fund , a Christian legal aid group that boasts a network of some 900 lawyers standing ready to ' defend Christmas , ' says it has moved about 20,000 ' Christmas packs . '
The packs , available for a suggested $ 29 donation , include a three - page legal memo and two lapel pins . "
" And Liberty Counsel , a conservative law firm affiliated with the Rev. Jerry Falwell , says it has distributed for free 16,000 legal memos on celebrating Christmas . "
" Leaders say demand for the goods — which are pitched online and through e-mail to supporters — is driven by what they view as a coordinated effort to secularize Christmas . "
Alliance Defense Fund , American Family Association , James Dobson 's Colorado - based Focus on the Family , and Concerned Women for America have banded together for a 2006 Christmas Project .
Chief on its agenda is a list of ' nice ' retailers that use the word ' Christmas ' in their stores and catalogues and ' naughty ' ones that do not .
" ' It 's a way to fight back against the secular progressives and promote the real meaning of Christmas , ' said Tim Wildmon , president of the American Family Association .
' They make a statement to anyone who looks at them and reads them that the person wearing them wants to keep Christ in Christmas ' . "
The AFA found the Christmas outreach so successful that they plan to make Easter buttons available this spring .

Web Services using a TCP proxy server ( Part 1 of 3 )
Last edited 2003 -04-13 by Jay Nelson
This tutorial demonstrates a simple , but non-trivial , example of a TCP proxy server using the OTP construct gen_server .
The goal is to implement a process that can be used to deliver web services to HTML browsers .
The source code is here .
This tutorial contains three parts : A generic TCP proxy server based on gen_server How to implement the ProxyModule interface A Web Service using the TCP proxy server Please , report all errors , omissions or improvements to the author .

Recognizing requests Extracting from web pages Synonym dictionary Pattern matching dictionary Zoning a page Pulling content from a zone Reconstructing web pages 1 . Description of a Proxy Server
We would like to provide Web Services , such as a page with 30 results from Google or a single page with news from Yahoo !
France , England , US and Argentina , however we do not have access to program the server .
Instead we provide a proxy server that relays information to the website and reformats the response for display in a web browser .
The proxy server can be used for other tasks , but as described , it expects to receive requests over a TCP socket .
Because we expect the proxy server to be transparently available at all times , we will use erlang 's OTP to manage the proxy server .
OTP provides a generic model of server functionality as well as the means to automatically restart the server if it fails , among other capabilities .
1.1
The proxy server interface
The proxy server has a very simple interface .
It can be started , it can list the clients that are currently attached to it and it can be stopped .
Once it has been started , the parent application may send it requests ( the clients of the server will be making requests using TCP socket requests rather than function calls ) .
It is implemented using the gen_server module .
The proxy server is linked to the calling process so the caller will know when the server goes down .
The code to implement the proxy server interface is in Listing 1 .
Other aspects of the server implementation are described in the following sections .
tcp_proxy.erl contains the full source code for the TCP proxy server .
Listing 1 . tcp_proxy external interface . - module( tcp_proxy ) . - behaviour ( gen_server ) . - define ( MSGPORT , 8000 ) . - define ( MAX_CONNECTS , 3 ) . - export ( [ start_link /1 , start_link / 2 , start_link / 3 , start_link / 5 , report_clients /1 , handle_request/3 , stop /1 ] ) . start_link ( ProxyModule ) -> start_link ( ProxyModule , ProxyModule , ?
MSGPORT , ?MAX_CONNECTS , ?CLIENT_TAB ) .
start_link ( ProxyModule , MaxConnects ) -> start_link ( ProxyModule , ProxyModule , ?
MSGPORT , MaxConnects , ?CLIENT_TAB ) . start_link ( ProxyModule , Port , MaxConnects ) -> start_link ( ProxyModule , ProxyModule , Port , MaxConnects , ?CLIENT_TAB ) .
start_link ( ServerName , ProxyModule , Port , MaxConnects , ClientTab ) -> case gen_server : start_link ( {local , ServerName} , ?
MODULE , [ ProxyModule , Port , MaxConnects , ClientTab ] , [ ] ) of {ok , Pid} -> start_listen ( Pid , Port ) ; {error , {already_started , OldPid}} -> {ok , OldPid} ; Error -> error_logger:error_report([ {start_link , Error} ] ) , Error end . report_clients ( Server ) > gen_server : call( Server , report_clients ) .
handle_request( Server , Request , Data ) -> gen_server : call( Server , {msg , Request , Data} ) . stop( Server ) -> gen_server : call( Server , stop ) .
start_link / 4 creates a new process that listens on the specified TCP port or the default port 8000 .
There is a maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed to prevent the server from being overloaded .
ProxyModule is an external module that is used by the application to define what the TCP proxy server is supposed to do .
Part 2 of this tutorial will explain how that module works using simple examples and Part 3 will describe a complete example for providing web services .
The name of the proxy module is stored internally by the tcp_proxy server until it is needed later .
gen_server : start_link / 4 takes a name , a module , an init list and a list of system options .
It creates a new process linked to the calling application with the name tcp_proxy registered locally as the name of the new process .
All callbacks used by gen_server are implemented in the tcp_proxy module ; all callbacks used by tcp_proxy are implemented in the ProxyModule module .
tcp_proxy : init/1 will be called with the list [ ProxyModule , Port , MaxConnects ] to initialize the state of the proxy server .
After it has initialized , it will start listening for TCP requests as well as application - level requests .
None of the debug or system options are used .
If the parent application needs a list of attached clients , report_clients / 0 is called .
It returns the list of clients along with some statistics about them by using the gen_server callback tcp_proxy : handle_call ( report_clients , From , State ) described below .
When an application - level request is received by the proxy server in handle_request / 2 , it passes the request to gen_server to generate a callback to tcp_proxy : handle_call ( {msg , Request} , From , State ) which is implemented later .
When an application - level command to stop the server is called , tcp_proxy passes it off to gen_server which in turn will callback to tcp_proxy : handle_call ( stop , From , State ) .
So far , we have seen that a separate process is running the gen_server behaviour .
Whenever the parent application needs to know anything about the server , or wants to shutdown the server , a function call is used that passes the work off to the gen_server process ( via a message send occurring inside the call to gen_server : call / 2 ) .
The reason for the indirection is that gen_server provides the main loop of the server and all the debug and system messages that can be monitored .
Any application requests have to be interleaved with the system messages and any debug requests have to be enforced .
Also , the server starts up with no state information but initializes a state variable to be used for subsequent requests .
gen_server manages the state variable and only passes it to the tcp_proxy when the callbacks described in the next section are invoked .
In addition , using callbacks is a way of encapsulating the format and protocol enforced by gen_server to communicate information between the application process and the gen_server process .
The function call interface prevents protocol translation errors .
1.2
The gen_server behaviour gen_server is what is called a behaviour .
It is a collection of functions that together provide a generic service that can be adapted to a particular application by supplying callbacks .
The callbacks that must be provided to instantiate a behaviour are available through the function behaviour_info / 1 as shown in Listing 2 . gen_server is defined in the stdlib module of erlang .
Listing 2 . Displaying gen_server required callbacks .
Erlang ( BEAM ) emulator version 5.2 [ source ] [ hipe ] Eshell V5.2 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > gen_server :behaviour_info( callbacks ) .
[ {init,1} , {handle_call, 3} , {handle_cast , 2} , {handle_info , 2} , {terminate , 2} , { code_change ,3} ]
The callbacks serve the following purposes : init( List ) -> {ok , State} | {stop , Reason} Called when the server is started .
This function must create the State that will be used in all subsequent callbacks , as well as set up any resources that are expected to be available by other callbacks .
This function is invoked by gen_server : start_link and gen_server : start .
handle_call( Request , From , State ) -> {reply , Reply , NewState} | {stop , Error , NewState}
Used by gen_server : call to make synchronous callbacks for service requests .
The server will block until this function returns .
This is typically where the meat of a gen_server implementation module will do its work .
handle_cast ( Request , State ) ->
Result Used by gen_server : cast to make asynchronous callbacks .
Is analogous to handle_call , except that it is non-blocking and it does not allow a message to go back to the From requester since that argument is not supplied by gen_server .
handle_info( Info , State ) ->
Result Called when a timeout occurs or a message other than a gen_server : call , gen_server : cast or system message is received .
Typically the implementation of this function just logs the Info for later analysis , but it is also useful for monitoring linked processes because any EXIT messages caused by them will be reported as a call to this interface .
terminate ( Reason , State )
Called when gen_server is about to end so that the implementation can clean up anything allocated in init / 1 .
It also gives a chance for statistics reporting , saving collected data for the next start up and generally to allow an orderly shutdown .
code_change ( OldVsn , State , Extra ) -> {ok , NewState} Called when a live upgrade of the code version occurs to notify the application that the old code is about to disappear .
This function should take care of any issues that might occur with the unloading of the current code version and then return an updated state to be used when the new code is loaded .
1.3 Architecting a server design
We now need to make some architectural design decisions .
The proxy server will accept connections via telnet , web browsers or other similar means .
Many processes may connect simultaneously and they all need to be served responsively , even though some sessions may be long and others short .
We also would like the server to be generally useful for a broad set of server applications that are accessible via TCP / IP .
Because we will have more than one simultaneous session , the code is simpler if there is a separate process for each connection .
Some applications may be concerned about overburdening the server , so we should keep track of the current set of active connections and update it as connections are started or dropped .
Also , we should provide a means for limiting the number of connections , as well as reporting to the client that the server is too busy to accept more requests .
To make the server generally useful , a ProxyModule callback behavior is implemented .
The application writer will create an instance of a tcp_proxy server and supply the module name that contains the callbacks implementing the proxy functionality .
For a browser cache , one ProxyModule would be written , for a webserver , a different ProxyModule would be provided .
In either case , the same gen_server process , protocol and semantics would apply but the implementation of the proxy functionality would differ .
Since there may potentially be a large number of clients , we need an efficient data structure for tracking them and a lightweight method of watching whether they are still connected including disconnections caused by process failure or network problems .
We will use the built in Erlang Term Storage ( ets ) data structure to track them since it runs in memory , provides constant time lookup to large amounts of data and has a convenient interface for managing the data .
If the client processes are linked to our server , we would have to trap EXITs to ensure a failing client does n't take down the whole server .
Instead we will use the erlang : monitor / 2 function so that a poorly implemented ProxyModule has less impact on the tcp_proxy server .
The only remaining decision is the protocol for accepting new connections .
The gen_tcp : accept /1 function blocks the currently running process until a TCP request to connect is received .
To prevent it from blocking the server so that it cannot respond to requests , the protocol must be to create a new process to use when waiting for a client connection .
Now the problem becomes one of managing and communciating the current State of the server .
While the Accept process is waiting , other calls may arrive which cause the server 's internal State to change .
When the Accept process finally receives a connection , the information must be communicated to the server process so that the connection bookkeeping can be kept current .
The moment immediately after a connection is received becomes a key synchronization point between the two processes because the gen_server needs to control how many connections are active while the Accept process has no knowledge of this information .
Synchronization of the two processes is achieved via a message .
Rather than having to pass a complex message containing an aggregate State from the gen_server , it is easier to pass the information about the new connection to the gen_server .
Since the gen_server needs to know when the connection is no longer active , even if the failure is caused by a process fault , it needs to monitor the process containing the socket .
The Accept process already owns the socket , and the gen_server is already monitoring the health of the Accept process , why not use it as the process that manages the connection until the client session ends ?
This means that the Accept process will only accept one connection .
The server must replace the Accept process with a new Accept process to allow a simultaneous connection .
This approach reduces the communication protocol that would be necessary if the Accept process continued looping and allowing new connections , ensures that a single Accept process is not running forever ( thus making hot swap to a new code version easier ) , and allows the gen_server to decide what to do when too many connections are active .
This last issue becomes a communication problem if the Accept process is looping independent of the gen_server .
Where possible it is best to solve problems by avoiding them altogether .
1.4 Implementing gen_server callbacks
Let 's start by implementing the initialization callback .
Listing 3 shows the init /1 function and the start_listen / 2 function .
After these two run , the server has created the Accept process which is waiting for a TCP connection , while the first gen_server process is waiting for either an application - level request for information , a request to stop the server , or a notification by the Accept process that a new connection has arrived .
Listing 3 . tcp_proxy initialization functions . - export ( [ init /1 ] ) .

Other end .
The init function receives the module name and port to listen on .
It creates a TCP Proxy State record ( of type tp_state ) that will be used in all subsequent calls to keep track of any persistent information that might be needed for bookkeeping purposes .
A record is commonly used to represent the state of a gen_server process .
We want to keep track of the TCP options used , the name of the ProxyModule , the port to listen on , the actual socket used for listening , the Accept process that is listening for socket connections , some statistics about connections as well as the ets table of connected processes .
Since we need to catch failures of the accept process , the gen_server must trap exits .
The init function must return the State representation to the gen_server .
Just as the gen_server provided an opportunity for tcp_proxy to initialize its internal state , this init function has to provide the ProxyModule a chance to initialize .
Later we will see the ProxyModule : init/0 function used to allocate a cache for storing webserver names .
The call must be wrapped in a catch so that we can detect failure and tell gen_server to shut the process down .
The ProxyModule initialization returns a state that tcp_proxy has to manage and send to the ProxyModule whenever a callback occurs .
start_listen makes a call to the gen_server requesting a callback to tcp_proxy : handle_call ( {listen , Port} , State ) , and if that succeeds , it requests a callback to tcp_proxy : handle_call ( accept , State ) .
The first callback will set up the listen socket , the second will spawn a new process to accept connections .
All the alternatives for handle_call / 3 are shown in Listing 4 , Listing 5 and Listing 6 .
Listing 4 . tcp_proxy : handle_call listen implementation .
- export ( [ handle_call /3 ] ) . %
Set up a new listen socket to prepare for connections handle_call ( {listen , NewPort} , _From , #tp_state {port = OldPort , tcp_opts = TcpOpts} = State ) -> %
Open a new listen port case catch gen_tcp: listen ( NewPort , TcpOpts ) of %
If we succeed , modify the state ( possibly closing the old % listen port ) and return a successful reply {ok , LSocket} -> NewPortState = State#tp_state{port = NewPort , listen = LSocket} , case OldPort of undefined -> {reply , ok , NewPortState} ; Port -> {reply , ok , NewPortState} ; % Close the old port , but do n't pay attention to result Other -> Table = State#tp_state.clients , ets:delete_all_objects( Table ) , gen_tcp:close ( OldPort ) , {reply , ok , NewPortState#tp_state{client_count = 0}} end ; %
If the call fails , tell the caller and do n't change state or % close the existing listen port since terminate / 2 will finish NotOK -> {stop , NotOK , State} end ;
The first clause of handle_call / 3 starts listening on the TCP port using the TCP options for the socket .
If this call occurs after the tcp_proxy is already listening on another port , the old port is closed and the new port becomes active .
If we change anything about the server state that was passed in , it needs to be updated in the state record and returned to the gen_server .
If this function returns a tuple that begins with the atom ' stop ' , gen_server will call tcp_proxy : terminate / 2 as soon as it can .
Listing 5 . tcp_proxy : handle_call accept and connect implementations .
%
Accept connections in a new process , recording it for later reference handle_call ( {accept , Server} , _From , #tp_state {accept_pid = undefined , listen = LSocket} = State ) -> Pid = spawn_link ( fun( ) -> accept( Server , LSocket ) end ) , {reply , ok , State#tp_state {accept_pid = Pid}} ; % Handle an incoming connection by replacing the Accept process handle_call ( {connect , Pid , Socket , Server} , _From , #tp_state {accept_pid = Pid , client_count = Connects , max_active = Max , clients =
Table , listen = LSocket , requests = Requests , pmodule = ProxyModule , pm_state = ProxyState} = State ) -> %
Start a new accept process NewAcceptPid = spawn_link ( fun( ) -> accept( Server , LSocket ) end ) , erlang : unlink ( Pid ) , % Avoids handle_info when too many connected case Connects < Max of %
Keep the new client but change to a lightweight monitor true -> MonitorRef = erlang : monitor ( process , Pid ) , %
Add the client process to the set of current connections ets:insert ( Table , { MonitorRef , Pid} ) , {reply , {ok , ProxyModule} , State#tp_state{accept_pid = NewAcceptPid , client_count = Connects +1 , requests = Requests + 1}} ; % Too many connections are currently active false -> Busy = State#tp_state.server_busy , {reply , {error , too_many_connections , ProxyModule} , State#tp_state{accept_pid = NewAcceptPid , requests = Requests +1 , server_busy = Busy + 1}} end ;
The second clause receives an open listen socket and accepts new connections to this socket from other processes and / or machines .
Because accept is a blocking call which will wait forever for a connection , a new process needs to wait so that the control thread of this process can be returned to gen_server to handle application - level requests .
When a new connection does arrive , the accept process makes a callback to connect handle_call passing the socket and server id .
A new accept process is spawned to replace the old one which will only live on as a client connection .
The client connection is unlinked and changed to a monitored process , added to the table of clients and the state statistics are updated , unless there are already too many client connections .
Listing 6 . tcp_proxy : handle_call msg request , report_clients and stop implementation .
%
Allow direct calls to functions defined in ProxyModule handle_call ( {msg , Request , Data} , From , #tp_state {pmodule = ProxyModule , pm_state = PMState} = State ) -> case catch ProxyModule : Request ( From , PMState , Data ) of {ok , NewProxyState} -> {reply , ok , State#tp_state {pm_state = NewProxyState}} ; % Report failure in other cases , but do n't take server down Other -> Fun = atom_to_list ( ProxyModule ) ++ " : " ++ atom_to_list ( Request ) ++ " /3 " , error_logger:error_report ( [ {Fun , Other} , {' State ' , State} ] ) , % Only return a new state if the ProxyModule detected and updated case Other of {error , Error , NewPMState} -> {reply , ok , State#tp_state{pm_state=NewPMState}} ; _ Other -> {reply , ok , State} end end ; handle_call ( report_clients , From , #tp_state {pmodule = ProxyModule , accept_deaths = Deaths , client_count = Active , clients =
Table , max_active = Max , requests = Connects , server_busy = Busy} = State ) -> {reply , {ok , [ {proxy_module , ProxyModule} , {active_clients , Active} , {clients , ets:tab2list ( Table ) } , {max_active_clients , Max} , {total_requests , Connects} , {server_busy , Busy} , {accept_failures , Deaths}]} , State} ; handle_call ( stop , _ From , State ) -> {stop , requested , State} .
The ProxyModule may implement data structures or processes that need to be periodically managed .
For example , if we build a caching proxy server that stores a copy of all webpages visited , there may need to be a periodic call to flush the cache , reap old entries , write it to disk , or perform other maintenance tasks .
The {msg Request} message is what triggers an arbitrary function in the ProxyModule , which is invoked by calling tcp_proxy : handle_request / 2 .
Since we can't anticipate the needs of the ProxyModule , a flexible run-time interface is used .
This function calls out by using the ProxyModule name stored in the State record coupled with the Request atom which should correspond to a function name in the ProxyModule .
Again , the ProxyState is passed to the ProxyModule and returned , potentially updated .
The application may request a list of the attached clients .
This is returned by the report_clients clause of handle_call .
For simplicity this function returns a proplist of the important values .
A clean way to shutdown the server is to call ' stop ' on it .
This causes gen_server to issue a terminate call and then shutdown .
This is exactly the effect of the application - level interface call tcp_proxy : stop/1 .
Listing 7 . tcp_proxy : handle_info implementation . - export ( [ handle_info /2 ] ) . handle_info({' EXIT ' , Pid , Reason} , #tp_state {accept_pid = Pid , accept_deaths = Deaths , listen = LSocket} = State ) -> error_logger:error_report ([{' Accept EXIT ' , Reason} , {' State ' , State} ] ) , ServerId = self ( ) , NewPid = spawn_link ( fun ( ) -> accept( ServerId , LSocket ) end ) , {noreply , State#tp_state{accept_pid = NewPid , accept_deaths = Deaths + 1}} ; handle_info( {' DOWN ' , MonitorRef , _Type , _Object , _Info} , #tp_state{clients = Table , client_count = OldCount} = State ) -> case ets:member ( Table , MonitorRef ) of true -> ets:delete( Table , MonitorRef ) , {noreply , State#tp_state{client_count = OldCount - 1}} ; false -> {noreply , State} end ; handle_info( Info , State ) -> error_logger:info_report ([ {' INFO ' , Info} , {' State ' , State} ] ) , {noreply , State} .
The function handle_info / 2 is called whenever any otherwise unhandled message is received by gen_server .
We need to handle the case when the accept process goes down and when a client connection is no longer active .
When the accept process dies , a new accept process is spawned and the death is counted for later analysis .
If a client connection goes down , the client process is removed from the client table and the active count is reduced .
All others are treated as informational messages and are logged .
Listing 8 . tcp_proxy : handle_call implementation . - export ( [ handle_cast /2 , terminate / 2 , code_change /3 ] ) . %
Just log any asynchronous gen_server requests handle_cast ( Cast , State ) -> error_logger:info_report ([ {' CAST ' , Cast} , {' State ' , State} ] ) , {noreply , State} . %
Log the failure of a linked process and then die handle_info ( {' EXIT ' , _ Pid , Reason} , State ) -> error_logger:error_report ([{' INFO -EXIT ' , Reason} , {' State ' , State} ] ) , {stop , Reason , State} ; % Just log any other informational messages handle_info( Info , State ) -> error_logger:info_report ([ {' INFO ' , Info} , {' State ' , State} ] ) , {noreply , State} . %
Log the termination reason and close any open listen port terminate ( Reason , State ) -> % Shutdown the ProxyModule first ProxyModule = State#state.module , ProxyModule: terminate ( State#state.pm_state ) , % Then the Socket error_logger : error_report ([{' TERMINATE ' , Reason} , {' State ' , State} ] ) , case State#state.listen of undefined -> ok ; Port -> gen_tcp:close( State#state.listen ) end . %
Just log a code change request code_change ( OldVsn , State , Extra ) -> error_logger:info_report([{' CODE -CHANGE-OLDVSN ' , OldVsn} , {' State ' , State} , {' Extra ' , Extra} ] ) , {ok , State} .
The callback for terminate / 2 just closes the listen socket and does n't bother to wait for a response to the request as shown in Listing 7 .
When the gen_server terminates , the attached Accept process will receive an ' EXIT ' message and will be shutdown automatically unless it chooses to respond to the message in a different way .
The remaining callbacks handle_cast / 2 and code_change are not needed by this example but must be included to avoid a failure when they are called by gen_server .
In the case of handle_info we include a handler for when an attached process dies as an example .
1.5 Implementing the Accept Connection process
When we started the listener , it spawned a new process that was linked to the gen_server .
The new process executed tcp_proxy : accept / 1 which is shown in Listing 9 .
This function blocks waiting for a TCP connection .
Once it receives one , it asks the gen_server to spawn a new accept process .
The existing process continues on relaying the client request to the ProxyModule as shown in Listing 10 .
If there are too many clients connected , a call is made to ProxyModule : server_busy / 1 so that it can properly relate the current status and then it is shut down .
Listing 9 . tcp_proxy : accept implementation . accept( Server , LSocket ) -> %
Wait for a client to connect case gen_tcp : accept ( LSocket ) of {ok , Socket} -> %
Request a new accept socket then start ProxyModule response Result = gen_server : call ( Server , { connect , self ( ) , Socket , Server} ) , case Result of {ok , ProxyModule} -> relay ( Server , ProxyModule , Socket ) ; % Let ProxyModule issue a server busy message {error , too_many_connections , ProxyModule} -> %
Socket refuses to accept data if it has n't been read gen_tcp: recv( Socket , 0 , 1000 ) , ProxyModule : server_busy ( Socket ) , gen_tcp:close ( Socket ) end ; %
Just let this process die if gen_tcp : accept fails %
The handle_info callback will notice and restart it .
NotOK -> error_logger:info_report ([ {" gen_tcp:accept " , NotOK} ] ) end .
tcp_proxy : relay /1 is the final function of the tcp_proxy module .
It reads all the data from the TCP socket as a binary and then hands this information to the function ProxyModule : react_to / 3 including the Socket connection so that the proxy module can reply to the requester if necessary .
The relay function makes sure that the Socket is closed when it is finished .
If the socket could not be read properly , or the callback to the proxy module fails , the event is logged before the relay process exits .
This function could easily be modified to route the request to any of several different ProxyModules or processes based on the format or contents of the received binary data .
Listing 10 . tcp_proxy : relay implementation . relay ( Server , ProxyModule , Socket ) -> %
Get the full TCP request case gen_tcp : recv( Socket , 0 ) of % Let the ProxyModule deal with it {ok , BinData} -> case catch ProxyModule : react_to( Server , Socket , BinData ) of ok -> ok ; {' EXIT ' , ok} -> ok ; {' EXIT ' , Reason} -> error_logger :info_report([{atom_to_list( ProxyModule ) ++ " : react_to/3 failed " , Reason} ] ) ; Other -> error_logger :info_report([{atom_to_list( ProxyModule ) ++ " : react_to/3 failed " , Other} ] ) end ; % Log any Socket receive problem NotOK -> error_logger:info_report ([ {" gen_tcp:recv/2 " , NotOK} ] ) end , % Close the socket in all cases gen_tcp : close ( Socket ) .
Continued in Part 2 .
Global Warming as Religion and not Science
Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction .
Blaise Pascal
It was Michael Crichton who first prominently identified environmentalism as a religion .
That was in a speech in 2003 , but the world has moved on apace since then and adherents of the creed now have a firm grip on the world at large .
Global Warming has become the core belief in a new eco-theology .
The term is used as shorthand for anthropogenic ( or man made ) global warming .
It is closely related to other modern belief systems , such as political correctness , chemophobia and various other forms of scaremongering , but it represents the vanguard in the assault on scientific man .
The activists now prefer to call it “ climate change ” .
This gives them two advantages :
It allows them to seize as “ evidence ” the inevitable occurrences of unusually cold weather as well as warm ones .
The climate is always changing , so they must be right .
Only the relatively elderly can remember the cynical haste with which the scaremongers dropped the “ coming ice age ” and embraced exactly the opposite prediction , but aimed at the same culprit – industry .
This was in Britain , which was the cradle of the new belief and was a response to the derision resulting from the searing summer of 1976 .
The father of the new religion was Sir Crispin Tickell , and because he had the ear of Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , who was engaged in a battle with the coal miners and the oil sheiks , it was introduced into international politics with the authority of the only major political leader holding a qualification in science .
The introduction was timely yet ironic since , in the wake of the world ’s political upheavals , a powerful new grouping of left - wing interests was coalescing around environmental issues .
The result was a new form of godless religion .
The global warming cult has the characteristics of religion and not science for the following reasons .
Faith and scepticism
Faith is a belief held without evidence .
The scientific method , a loose collection of procedures of great variety , is based on precisely the opposite concept , as famously declared by Thomas Henry Huxley :
The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority , as such .
For him , scepticism is the highest of duties ; blind faith the one unpardonable sin .
Huxley was one of a long tradition of British sceptical philosophers .
From the Bacons , through the likes of Locke , Hume and Russell , to the magnificent climax of Popper ’s statement of the principle of falsifiability , the scientific method was painfully established , only to be abandoned in a few short decades .
It is one of the great ironies of modern history that the nation that was the cradle of the scientific method came to lead the process of its abandonment .
The great difference , then , is that religion demands belief , while science requires disbelief .
There is a great variety of faiths .
Atheism is just as much a faith as theism .
There is no evidence either way .
There is no fundamental clash between faith and science – they do not intersect .
The difficulties arise , however , when one pretends to be the other .
The Royal Society , as a major part of the flowering of the tradition , was founded on the basis of scepticism .
Its motto “ On the word of no one ” was a stout affirmation .
Now suddenly , following their successful coup , the Greens have changed this motto of centuries to one that manages to be both banal and sinister – “ Respect the facts . ”
When people start talking about “ the facts ” it is time to start looking for the fictions .
Real science does not talk about facts ; it talks about observations , which might turn out to be inaccurate or even irrelevant .
The global warmers like to use the name of science , but they do not like its methods .
They promote slogans such a “ The science is settled ” when real scientists know that science is never settled .
They were not , however , always so wise .
In 1900 , for example , the great Lord Kelvin famously stated , " There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now .
All that remains is more and more precise measurement . "
Within a few years classical physics was shattered by Einstein and his contemporaries .
Since then , in science , the debate is never closed .
The world might ( or might not ) have warmed by a fraction of a degree .
This might ( or might not ) be all ( or in part ) due to the activities of mankind .
It all depends on the quality of observations and the validity of various hypotheses .
Science is at ease with this situation .
It accepts various theories , such as gravitation or evolution , as the least bad available and of the most practical use , but it does not believe .
Religion is different .
Sin and absolution
It is in the nature of religion to be authoritarian and proscriptive .
Essential to this is the concept of sin – a transgression in thought or deed of theological principles .
Original sin in the older religions derived from one of the founts of life on earth – sex .
The new religion goes even further back to the very basis of all life – carbon .
Perhaps the fundamental human fear is fear of life itself .
The amazing propensity of carbon to form compounds of unlimited complexity made the existence of life possible , while its dioxide is the primary foodstuff , the very start of the food chain .
Every item of nutriment you consume started out as atmospheric carbon dioxide .
It is therefore the ideal candidate for original sin , since no one can escape dependence on it .
This manna that gave us life is now regularly branded in media headlines as “ pollution ” and “ toxic ” : surely one of the most perverse dysphemisms in the history of language .
The corrective to sin in religion is absolution , and the power of most religions comes from their claim to have the monopoly on absolution .
So it is with the new godless religion .
Furthermore , it is in the nature of religion to create false markets .
In the time of Chaucer the Pardoner sold papal indulgences , which freed the prosperous from the consequences of sin .
Likewise , the new pardoners sell carbon offsets .
As in so much of both ancient and modern society these activities divert effort from wealth creation and so act as a drag on the economy .
They also grant to the rich a comfort that is not available to the poor – a sure road to success .
Proselytes and evangelists
Most religions seek to grow by means of proselytism .
Science does not seek or need converts .
It teaches those that are willing to learn , but it does not impose itself on those who are indifferent .
Religions ( at least those that are successful ) have a different imperative .
A growing cohort of believers reinforces the beliefs of existing adherents and participating in the quest for converts helps assuage the inevitable doubts they might harbour .
Successful religions are structured to encompass this expansionary mechanism .
Those who can recruit others to the cause are therefore held in high regard .
Demagogues and hypocrites
Demagoguery is also , therefore , a feature of religion .
Some people have the capacity to hold the masses in their thrall .
It is a mysterious art , as their skills of oratory do not often stand up to any sort of critical examination .
They are idols of the moment , who often turn out to have feet of clay , as so frequently seems to happen with charismatic TV preachers .
One of the most notorious demagogues of the godless religion is Al Gore .
He is certainly no great orator , but he makes up for it with chutzpah .
His disregard for truth is exemplified by his characteristic and ubiquitous pose in front of a satellite photograph of hurricane Katrina .
Even some of the most vehement climate “ scientists ” refrain from connecting that particular isolated and monstrously tragic event with global warming .
Likewise his Old Testament style prophecies of further disasters , such as floods due to a rise in sea level , greatly exceed the more modest claims of the “ professionals ” .
As in the overthrow of the cities of the plain and other biblical prophecies , Gore promises a rain of fire and brimstone on us , unless we change our ways .
Gore also displays all the characteristics of the classical religious hypocrite .
He disregards his own proscriptions with abandonment and ostentation .
By his own measure ( carbon footprint ) his sins are great ; at least twenty times those of the average American .
It is all right though , because he purchases absolution ( carbon offsets ) through his own company .
As he is a private individual it is not known whether he profits directly , but at a minimum he does not pay out of his taxable income and , worst of all , he demonstrates that the rich are immune from any of the actual privations that attachment to the new religion visits upon its poorer adherents .
This is also not unknown in traditional religions and has been a source of material for satirists throughout the centuries .
Infidels and apostates
Religions vary in their treatment of unbelievers , which ranges from disregard to slaughter .
The new religion relies at present on verbal assault and character assassination , though there are those who would go further .
They call the infidels “ deniers ” – a cheap and quite despicable verbal reference to the Holocaust .
There is a sustained campaign to deny the deniers any sort of public platform for their views .
Apostates are universally even more reviled than infidels .
They have turned their backs on the true faith , whichever that might happen to be .
Partial apostates , or heretics , are even more loathed and through the ages have been subjected to the most appalling punishments and deaths .
In the case of the “ sceptical environmentalist ” , Bjorn Lomborg , he is of the faith .
In fact he is a serial believer ; accepting , for example , that eating celery causes two percent of all cancers and , of course , that global warming is man made , but he rejects the sacrificing of humanity to the belief .
This is unacceptable !
What are a few million deaths from dirty water , mosquito bites and other hazards so long as people can be made to conform ?
So far he has only been assaulted with insults and custard pies .
Patrick Moore , a founder of Greenpeace , broke with the movement over its growing anti-human , anti-scientific tendencies and drift into extremism .
The last straw for him was the campaign against chlorine , not only an essential component of human life but also the basis of one of the most dramatically life - saving hygienic interventions .
He has , consequently , been subjected to a prolonged campaign of vilification , described as an eco -Judas , turncoat and traitor .
Every minor commentator or blogger who manifests disbelief can expect to be the target of abuse from self - appointed protectors of the creed .
Sacrifice and ritual
It is part of human nature that we do not like to admit making a mistake , even to ourselves .
So if , for example , we buy a magic device that by some mysterious means improves the fuel efficiency of our car , we drive a little more conservatively in order to prove that we have not been had .
Religions exploit this weakness as a means of creating and reinforcing commitment .
If someone can be induced or coerced into making a sacrifice they then have a stake in the cause .
Windmills , for example , are the symbols of power , not physical power ( of which they are derisorily short ) but political and religious power .
They are like the great domes of temples , the statues of Saddam or the big “ M ” arch of MacDonald’s .
Windmills are ugly : they destroy the visual ( and aural ) landscape , but that is their purpose .
They are part of the sacrifice .
It would not be so bad if they were simply useless , but it is worse than that .
Conventional generating systems of equivalent power have to operate for 80 % of the time , while the wind is blowing too soft or too hard , and then be switched to warm standby when it is just right , an expensive and wasteful process .
Windmills are there to remind us of our commitment , willing or not , to the cause , both in excessive taxation and loss of visual and aural amenity .
As in other forms of mental conditioning , continued reinforcement is a necessary part of the process and that is where ritual comes in .
Ritual comprises tiny sacrifices infinitely repeated .
Going round the house switching off standby lights performs the same function as the repetitive chanting of mantras .
The fact that it is pointless is the whole point .
One of the most valuable ideas of modern engineering , lost in the noise , has been lost in the noise .
In most applications a change of , say , one part in ten thousand is too small to be measured and therefore not worthy of concern .
If standby in domestic devices ever were a problem , it is now a rapidly diminishing one .
In the old days of thermionic devices ( valves or tubes ) it was necessary to keep cathodes heated to avoid a prolonged warming up period , but transistors and LCDs do not have cathodes and are therefore instantly available .
Present standby powers are about five watts .
In the temperate zone that is transferred from your central heating bill for half the year , though it is barely enough to keep your big toe warm .
In fact , it would be relatively easy to make the standby power microwatts , just enough to power an optical sensor and decoder , though until now nobody thought such a pointless exercise necessary .
Prophecy and divination
In the real world attempts at prophecy always come to a bad end .
Only in religious texts and the currently popular fantasy fiction do prophecies come true .
H G Wells , in
The shape of things to come , successfully predicted the mechanised War , as did Winston Churchill , but little else , and the film that Wells closely supervised now provides rather comic entertainment ( but wonderful music ) .
Even those of us closely involved in electronics did not foresee that a development of the ancient art of writing on stone , lithography , would result in millions of transistors being available on one chip , changing the world forever , including granting new and sinister means of control to those in authority .
Likewise , divination was greatly regarded in all cultures , ancient and modern .
Stars were observed , chickens and other animals slaughtered , so that their steaming entrails could be examined to predict the future , cards were shuffled and crystal balls peered into .
Comparatively recently the leader of the most powerful nation on earth relied on the advice of astrologers .
Now divination has returned with , for example , the examination of the entrails of ancient trees .
Though the methods used are invalid ( they wrongly assume linearity ) and have been comprehensively shown to be irreproducible and misleading , the results have been paraded before the world in defence of draconian sacrificial policies .
The main form of modern divination , however , is computer models .
Forty odd years ago an instruction passed round the Faculty of Engineering of the University of London that no PhDs were to be awarded on the basis of computer models unsupported by measurement .
As T S Eliot asked in Choruses from The Rock
Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge ?
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information ?
Now , huge and generously funded university and government departments do nothing but develop computer models , involving assumptions about physical interactions that are still not understood by science .
Their dubious ( to say the least ) results are used by the new international priesthood to frighten the people into conformity .
Puritans and killjoys
No one has bettered Mencken ’s definition of Puritanism – the haunting fear that someone , somewhere , may be happy .
It is an unfortunate characteristic of many varieties of religion that this characteristic is to the fore and Global Warming is far from being an exception .
Nothing the proponents offer involves an improvement or even maintenance of human contentment , quite the opposite in fact .
You might think that any philosophy of life would involve swings and roundabouts , good and bad , but think again .
Virtually everything you enjoy is now sinful – holidays , driving your car , having a comfortable temperature in your home , being free from the stink of rotting garbage , and on and on .
As with the flagellants of old , for some people a feeling of self - righteousness not only transcends all discomforts , but derives from them .
The rest of us have to be coerced into conformity .
It is an unfortunate fact of life that there are people who get their kicks out of pushing other people around .
The existence of little pleasures of life , such as savouring a fine wine or cigar ( and even more so the proletarian equivalents ) is intolerable to them .
They will exploit any means – the distortion of science , the suborning of weak politicians , the repetition of mendacious propaganda – to achieve the elimination of the hated practices .
The eleventh commandment for the killjoys is “ Thou shalt not have fun ” , and global warming provides a delightful playground for them .
Censorship and angles
Freedom of speech and publication is at the very heart of science .
Even the most foolish of hypotheses is allowed to be offered for examination .
In much of religion the opposite is true ; challenging the established dogma is heresy , for which the punishment has ranged from ostracism to horrific torture and death .
One of the greatest ironies produced by the successful policy of entryism by the eco- theologians is that it is none other than the Royal Society that has been orchestrating the attempt to censor any deviation from establishment beliefs .
Authoritarian politicians , such as Congressman Brad Miller , would give such suppression the force of law .
It is a curious repetition of history that those who advance the hypothesis that the sun is the controlling element in changes of climate are vilified , just as Galileo was , for supporting the Copernican heliocentric description of the solar system .
Yet the sun is clearly the driver for climate – if it stopped shining , the earth ’s temperature would drop to near absolute zero .
In the establishment dogma the sun is barely mentioned , while the puny efforts of mankind are gratuitously magnified out of proportion .
In a scientific approach to climate , a full understanding of the behaviour of that solitary driver would be the first prerequisite , but this is waived in the interests of piety ; so leading solar researchers have been deprived of funding .
One of the most exploited ways of angling the news is by “ ratchet reporting ” .
News of unusual warm weather , for example , is given copious coverage , while cold weather is studiously ignored .
Thus the spring of 2007 was disastrously cold in parts of North America , with ice - bound ships and snowed - off baseball , but this was kept secret from the British , whose wonderful summery April was presented as though it were bad news ( and that in the land of rheumatism and bronchitis ! ) .
The fact that Britain had no spring at all in 2006 was conveniently forgotten , except as a basis of comparison to establish that 2007 was substantially warmer .
That the media know that they are peddling untruths is demonstrated by these tricks they get up to .
If they were confident of the truth of their case there would be no need to fake the coverage .
They have been frequently caught out faking their numbers and graphs , but only a few internet surfers know about it .
If you think you have a good case , you can afford to present both sides , but they do n’t .
The great majority of the population have no idea that there is an alternative view .
That is not science , it is religion .
Control and taxation
Religion has always played an important part in the imposition of authority .
For many centuries it took the form of the “ Divine Right of Kings ” or the “ Mandate of Heaven ” .
Once you get the people to believe , you can get away with almost any imposition .
The alliance between the shaman and the legislator has long been the very foundation of authoritarianism .
Even when the dogma is a godless one , such as Marxism , it is imposed with religious fervour , for that is the way to induce conformity .
People now accept laws that restrict their liberty and standard of living , which would once have provoked riots , because they are cloaked in a quasi-religious formula of environmentalism .
So - called environmental burdens , for example , now greatly outweigh the incremental effect of the poll tax that met with such violent opposition in England , yet are now meekly accepted , as is the parasitic presence of various forms of snooper , who even invade people ’s dustbins .
Contradictions and irrationality
Traditional religions not only tolerated contradiction and irrationality , they embrace them as part of the mystique .
Words and phrases are repeated ad nauseam and in strange contexts , until they lose all meaning and become self - preserving mantras .
Contradictions and irrationality also abound in the modern theocratic world .
The EU , for example , gratuitously destroys a tiny industry making traditional barometers , on the grounds of an irrational fear of mercury , then imposes the use of fluorescent light bulbs that distribute that same dreaded substance in huge quantities across the continent , all on the basis of the threat of global warming .
People who have never heard of Wien or Planck confidently assert that it is “ obvious ” that man-made CO 2 will cause runaway warming of the planet , when it is not at all obvious to many who are familiar with the works of those gentlemen .
It is obvious in the sense that it is obvious that believers will have everlasting life or that a senseless act of self - immolation will earn the eternal attentions of 72 virgins in Paradise .
The capacity to believe six impossible things before breakfast has been restored from fantasy to accepted normality .
Wealth and power
Some organisms develop the ingredients to survive and multiply , so it is with business and religions .
It is characteristic of businesses that they dispose of the entrepreneurs who create them and are taken over by a different breed of corporate manager : so it is with religions .
The brutally suppressed troglodytes who were the early Christians of Rome were a different breed from the cardinals , bishops and abbots who bestrode mediaeval Europe and lived the opulent life .
There were also , of course , the humble and saintly mendicant friars .
The equivalents of all these varieties exist within the new movement .
Money is the basis of the new religion .
It poured in from various foundations ( the so - called ketchup money ) and naïve donors .
The activists found that they had to maintain and innovate their product ( anxiety ) to keep the income rising , so they had to keep increasing the imaginary threats both in intensity and number .
With money came power .
In Britain , the political parties are all effectively bankrupt , so the temptation to hang onto the coattails of a movement with so much momentum was irresistible .
Even the Conservative Party submitted to a coup that was totally alien to everything it had ever believed in .
The other route to power was the Trotskyite method of entryism .
Once one adherent to the cause obtained a position of authority he could recruit others of a like mind .
One by one the bastions of the media , and even science itself , fell to the intruders .
A new breed of environmental editors achieved a monopoly of reporting in those areas that coincided with their beliefs .
With powerful media organisations behind them they then also had the protection of the law to intimidate their adversaries .
Opposition to the movement was largely confined to the internet and a few determined individuals in remote institutions , such as the emasculated rump of the British House of Lords .
With power comes patronage .
At its best this has produced great architecture and art .
At its worst it produces vast acres of ugly , worse than useless windmills and rigidly controlled research .
What passed as scientific research a quarter of a century ago now barely exists .
To get funding , your project has to conform to one of the mantra descriptions , such as “ sustainable development ” .
Doubters are afraid to speak out .
Their institutions are dependent on millions in grants at the disposal of green officials to obtain “ appropriate ” results relevant to global warming and related scares .
When your institution is involved in a fight for survival , you do not rock the boat .
The lavishness of the tax - funded , aviation - fuelled , international junkets enjoyed by the global warming priesthood , contrasted with the frugal gatherings of their relatively impotent scientific opponents , is the very stuff of mediaeval satire .
Just as Rabelais had to go into hiding from the anger of the priesthood of his time , so critics of the new religion are largely confined to the interstices of the internet .
As ever , wealth and power determine the ability to propagate one ’s views .
It might be some small compensation for members of the resistance , cowering in the electronic maquis , that history remembers the name of Rabelais , while his persecutors are forgotten .
Confession and salvation
One of the last bastions of science to fall was the British Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts , Science and Manufacture .
It has a Chief Executive who was formerly one of the most powerful green civil servants .
It now offers its fellows the opportunity to make public confession of their sins in the form of their “ carbon footprint ” .
They even have a programme of “ Carbon Control ” directed at seven to fourteen year olds , urging them to take control of their carbon emissions .
Young children now have nightmares about the burning planet , just as some of us once had nightmares about burning in hell unless we believed , and then lay awake at night wondering whether we believed or not , or what “ believe ” actually means .
The ruthless exploitation of the receptivity of the young , and their relentless indoctrination , is one of the less pleasant characteristics of much of religion .
As the Jesuits say “ Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man . ”
Hell - fire is the stick and salvation is the carrot .
Perhaps the best you can say about the new religion is that the object of salvation is “ the planet ” and not just oneself .
It is also the worst you can say ; for it is essentially inhuman ; which is what inflames heretics like Lomborg .
Science , of course is also inhuman .
Science though , unlike religion , does not seek to dictate policy .
It can provide information for policy - makers , such as “ If you do this , millions of Africans are likely to die ” but it does not say “ You must , or must not , do this . ”
Religion , depending upon its particular variety , will say “ They must be saved ” or , while not so indelicate as to put it into words , “ Let them die . ”
One of the most offensive manifestations of the new religion occurred when hundreds of the priesthood went on one of their lavish junkets in Africa , where all around them was suffering and death .
Envoi
The human spirit is sick .
It soared during the enlightenment of the eighteenth century .
It flowered during the nineteenth .
It beat off the tyrants of the twentieth century .
Now , at an alarming rate , it is surrendering its freedoms to a concocted religion based on fraudulent science .
Of course , it is not only science that has suffered in the overwhelming cultural downturn .
The great artistic tradition has given way to displays of dead animals and soiled beds .
In much of what passes for literature and drama , the expletives remain while the loftier aspirations of humanity are deleted .
Entertainment is debased by displays of banality , cruelty and vacuous , groundless celebrity .
It was science , however , that gave us lives of a length , comfort and healthiness that were unthought - of , even within human memory ; a gift that is cold - bloodedly , but covertly , being denied to millions in poorer parts of the world .
Extremists of the new religion regard humanity as an inconvenience or a pestilence that can be disposed of ( not including themselves , of course ) .
Above all , science represented the triumph of humanity over the primitive superstitions that haunted our ancestors , a creation of pure reason , a monument to that evolutionary ( or , if you prefer , God - given ) miracle of the human brain .
It is too valuable just to be tossed away like a used tissue .
But who will speak for science when the barbarian is already inside the gate ?

先月、朝日新聞社「論座」のインタビューを受けたものが記事となり、今月5日発売号に掲載されている。
ウィニー騒動の本質 あまりにも情報流出のリスクが大きい , 論座 2006 年5 月 号
ここで確認しておきたい論旨は次の点である。
情報流出はウィニーだけの問題ではないとの声もある。だが、ウィニーの登場で情報漏洩による被害は格段に深刻なものとなった。ウィニーから流出した情報は、ほとんど自動的に無制限に広がっていく。回収する手段は皆無と言っていい。その深刻さは、今年3月に注目された新種のコンピューターウイルス「山田オルタナティブ」と比較すれば一目瞭然だ。「山田」に感染すると、パソコン内のデータが全部、外部から直接閲覧できてしまう。しかし、感染に気づいてパソコンをインターネットから切断すれば1次流出はそこで止まり、積極的に2次流出させる第三者がいない限り、それ以上は拡散しない。他人の個人情報を2次流出させたがる人はそういないし、何の罪もない人の個人情報が暴かれた場合、「かわいそう」「ひどい」という感覚が、ネットユーザー間で生まれることがある。「人間的良心」が抑止力として働くのだ。
しかし、ウィニーは違う。何十万台ものパソコンを相互に接続し、常時ファイルを流通させる仕組みのため、1次流出が自動的に2次流出、3次流出、4次流出となる。（略）
いったん流出したファイルが止められないのは、その独特の使用方法にも原因がある。ウィニーユーザーは、必要なものだけ選んでダウンロードするのではなく、キーワード検索にヒットするファイルを片っ端からダウンロードして、後から必要なものだけ見るという使い方をする。そのため延々とウィニーを接続し続ける。（略）
暴露ウイルスはそれを利用し、「お宝 」
「美少女」などの人気キーワードや流出データと分かるタイトルをつけてファイルを「放流」する。誰かの検索にヒットすることで、いつまでもウィニー・ネットワーク上を流通するのだ。
ウィニーでは、他の人がやりとりするファイルまで勝手に自分のパソコンに入ってくることがある。第三者のパソコンを経由することで匿名性を高めているのだ。最近は女性のウィニーユーザーも少なくないと聞く。「私のウィニーはきれいなウィニー」と思っていても、実際には児童ポルノなどのデータが自分のウィニーの「キャッシュ」というフォルダ内に自動的に入ってくる。キャッシュ内のファイルは簡単には開けない。知らず知らず他人の違法行為の片棒を担がされ、流出情報の2次流出役を担わされるのである。
海上自衛隊の被害者は、ウイルス対策ソフトを常に更新しており、「自分は絶対にウイルスに感染しないと思っていた」と話したという。しかし、最新のウイルスは防ぎようがない。生命体のウイルスに対するワクチンと同様に、感染の拡大を一定レベルに抑えるための仕組みでしかないからだ。流行の初期段階で感染する少数の人を守るものではない。少数の個人だけを標的にした不正プログラムは、普通のウイルス対策ソフトでは防げない。
どんなに正しい知識を持って注意していても人はミスをする。たった一度のミスでも、ウィニー・ネットワークに秘密を流出させてしまったら終わりだ。たとえ自分がウィニーを使わないようにしていても、他人が動かしているウィニーに接続してファイルを放流する悪質なウイルスが今後出てくる危険性もある。勤務先のファイルは持ち帰らないように徹底しても、プライベート写真やメールが流出したら困る。万が一の被害を抑えるために、ウィニー・ネットワークはできるだけ縮小したほうがいい。ウィニーの使用を自粛するよう国民に呼びかけた安倍官房長官の発言（3月15日）には、そうした意味もあると思う。根絶は難しいにしても、少なくともウィニーユーザーは、自分のウィニーが何をしているかを知り、自分が何の片棒を担がされているかを自覚すべきだということだけは言える。
論座の記事には明確には書かれていないが、「ミス」とは、脆弱性を突かれてトロイを実行させられるケースも含む。もちろん、普段からWindows
Updateして脆弱性を排除する作業を怠らないのは元々当然だが、脆弱性が見つかるのはWindowsだけではない。FlashプラグインやQuickTimeプラグイン、Becky!などのメールソフト、Java 2 実行環 境( JRE ) など、インストールしているソフトウェアのすべてにパッチをあてていなければ、事故は起こり得る。そのような管理を完遂できると自信を持って言える人がどれだけいるだろうか。加えて、未公表の脆弱性が発見者に悪用される「0 -day 攻撃」のリスクも存在する。
シナリ オ( A )
Winnyを巡る現在の世論はどうなっているだろうか。不思議なことに現時点ではマスメディアも「
Winnyが悪い」と決め付ける様子がない。人気ブロガーたちもこぞって「 Winnyは悪くない」の大合唱だ。「悪いのはトロイを踏んだ人だ」と言ってみたり、「悪いのは情報を自宅に持ち出した人だ」とか、「悪いのはウイルスだ」とか、「包丁は人も殺せるが……」とか延々繰り返している。
トロイを踏む不用意さも問題だし、自宅に持ち出すことも問題だし、ウイルスも悪いが、Winnyネットワークも危険なのである。なぜその事実を直視することから逃れるのか。
たとえば、「 japan.internet.com編集部」が客観性を失っている様子が次の記事に見てとれる。
これはアンケートの結果を分析する記事なのに、「 Winnyそのものに原因があると思う」との回答の前に、どういうわけか、「ソフトウェアは常に人間が動かすものだが」などという著者の主観による注釈（多かった回答に対する反論めいたもの）を付け加えてしまっている。
人気ブロガー が 「 Winnyは安全である」などというトンチキなことを言い始めた事例もある。
Winnyが残したもの , アンカ テ( Uncategorizable Blog ) , 2006年3月22 日 Winnyは安全である。メーラーやブラウザのように、外部から来たデータがオペレータの意図に反して、間違って実行されてしまうことがない。本来、ワームとは利用者に何の落ち度がなくても拡散するものであり、Winnyのようにセキュリティーホールが無いソフトではあり得ないものだ。「暴露ウィルス」は別の名前で呼ぶべきものだと思う。
Winnyが危険であるというのは全くの間違いで、外部から来た信頼できないデータをプログラムとして実行してしまうことが危険なのである。「暴露ウィルス」では、実行するのは馬鹿なユーザであって、Winny本体が勝手に外部から来たデータを実行することはない。
正直、この人がこんな馬鹿だとは思わなかった
この種の「識者」達にとっては、Winny礼賛に導く新しい「理論」をどれだけ唱えられるかが思想エリートとしてのテーゼなのだろう。
│ Winnyが危険であるというのは全くの間違いだ。
│ ソフトウェアは常に人間が動かすものだ。

ここまで「識者」達の思考を狂わせてしまうものはいったい何か。それは、Winny作者が著作権法違反幇助の罪で逮捕、起訴されたことが発端であろう。
Winnyニートのみならず、関心がなかったあるいは中立的だった人たちさえ、作者が幇助犯として処罰されること自体に対する危機感から、「ということにしたい」症候群に陥ってしまった。あるいは、本当のことはわかっていても、意図して「大人の議論」をしている人もいるのだろう。そしてその「大人の議論」を真に受ける人が続出している。それどころか、それまで「 Winnyはけしからん」としていた人たち（著作権ビジネス界の）さえも黙らせてしまった。Winnyを悪く言うだけでバッシングの対象となる恐れがあり、本当のことを言うのが難しくなっている。
しかし、ここで注意したいのは、「 Winnyネットワーク自体が危険である」という事実を認めることが、「
Winnyの製造は悪である」を意味するわけではないということだ。今では作者自身が、Winnyネットワーク自体が危険であることについて「 Winnyの技術的的欠陥」と認めているのである。
開発者が語 る “ ポスト Winny ” , ITmediaニュース , 2006 年 1月30 日 金子氏は、 一度放流したファイルは消せないという管理不可能性 は「 Winnyの技術的欠陥 」 と自ら認め る 。これを解決するアイデアはいろいろあるというが、Winny開発をめぐって公判中の今の彼は、それを試せる立場にはない。
Winny開発者が講演 「 ウイルスの対処は可能だが現状では身動きが取れない 」 , INTERNET
Watch , 2006 年3 月13 日 金子氏は、 「 これを応用すれば、ファイル共有の方も管理可能になり、現在流通しているファイルを変更・削除するといったことも可能になるのではないかと考えていた」と語った。こうした管理機能は、掲示板については確実に実装する予定で、ファイル共有については当時は可能性について考えていただけだが、現在ではファイル共有についても管理は可能だと考えているという。
現在の作者のスタンスは 、Winnyは技術的な試験のために作り配布したもので、その技術は発展途上のものだった（「そのため意図せず著作権侵害の蔓延を許してしまった」ということか？）ということになっている。だからその意味でもむしろ、現在のWinnyには欠陥があるということに「しなくてはならない」のだ。いまさら「 Winnyはすばらしい」などと言い続けようとしている連中は、頭のネジが緩んでいることに気づくべきである。
ところで 、AntinnyがWinnyネットワークを崩壊させるために作られたとみる人もいるようだが、それは違うだろう。
日本人ウイルス作者というものを考えてみると、従来、単純に増殖するだけのウイルスはあまり登場しなかった。これはおそらく、「ウイルスをばらまく愉快犯は子どもっぽい」と見なす文化的風潮からくるものだろう。発展途上国ではメールで広がるワームを作った程度でヒーロー扱いされることがあったようだが、（フロッピーディスクに感染する昔のウイルスならともかく）いまどきワームを作ることくらい何ら高度な技術を要しないのであるから、単に増殖するだけで喜んでいては馬鹿にされるだけだ。システムに甚大な被害をもたらすウイルスを撒く行為は厳しく断罪されることだろう。
だが 、Antinny作者は、Winnyユーザだけをターゲットとすることで、そうした批判が自分に向かうのを避けることに成功している。Winnyを使っていること自体がろくなものではないと皆わかっているので、ウイルス被害者は同情されない。「悪いのはトロイを踏んだ人だ」と言っている人たちは、愚かなことに、ウイルス作者の思惑にまんまと乗せられてしまっている。
つまり 、Antinnyは、Winnyネットワークを壊すことなく、人を罠に陥れる楽しみを続けられるように（手加減して）作られているのである。
したがって、次の展開によって、Winnyネットワークは崩壊への道をたどると考えられる。
メールソフト やWebブラウザの脆弱性を突く 0-day攻撃で、何の落ち度もない人達に感染するウイルスが登場する。そのウイルスは、被害者のコンピュータ内の秘密のファイルをWinnyネットワークに放流する。Winnyを使っていなくても、他人が使っているWinnyに接続して放流してしまう 。
自称進歩的識者達がこの被害に遭う。このとき、もはや「誰それが悪い」と言えないだろう。自分の身に降りかかった痛みを知ってようやくWinnyネットワークの存在自体の危険に目を向けることとなる。「
Winnyは安全だ 」
「悪いのはトロイを踏んだ馬鹿な人だ」などと言っていたトンチキが目を覚まし、「やっぱりWinnyを止めよう」ということになり、Winnyネットワークはようやく縮小の方向に向かう。

ネットエージェント社が以前から、Winnyプロトコルを自在に操るツールを作っていることを公表していた。
ネットエージェント 、Winny上のファイル共有者を特定するソフトを開発 , INTERNET Watch , 2004 年5月13 日
だが、これはビジネスとして展開されていたようで、これが一般の人の手に渡ることはなかった。ところが、先日、米eEye社がその種のツールを無償で公開する予定であることを明らかにした。
検出ツールの開発者が語る ，「 Winnyを検出する方法 」 , 鵜飼裕司 , 日経IT Pro , 2006 年 4月12 日 Winnyプロトコルを利用すれば、Winnyネットワーク内のノード情報（IPアドレス、ポート番号、クラスタリング情報など）を収集することができます。また、キー・パケットの収集により、特定ノードが持つファイル一覧や、特定ファイルを持つノード一覧なども取得できます。
このような仕組みを実現するWinnyネットワーク分析システムは既に実装が完了しており、今後、何らかの形で一般に無償配布できればと考えています。その他、漏洩してしまった情報の追跡や消去を支援するためのツール群も開発中です。こちらもあわせて無償配布したいと考えています。
このようなツールが誰でも利用できるようになると、次のような展開が予想される。
まず、個人情報を流出させた者もしくはその代理人、あるいは被害者（漏らされた情報の主体）の代理人が、これらのツールを使って、そのファイルを持っているWinnyノードのIPアドレスを洗い出し、プロバイダ責任法に基づいてISP経由で当該ノードのWinny利用者にファイルの削除を要請する。
そのとき 、 「そのファイルをダウンロードした記憶がないので、何かの間違いではないか」との疑問を持つWinnyユーザが続出し、そのことが世間で話題となる。
それにより、Winnyがcacheと呼んでいる仕組みのことがあちこちで解説されるようになり、「cacheにファイルを持っているだけで公衆送信可能化しているのだ」という事実が広く知れ渡り始める。実際、任意のWinnyノードの所有するファイルを閲覧できるツールを皆が使うようになれば、そのことは一目瞭然となるだろう。（Webを閲覧しているのと同じに見える。）
一方、Winnyネットワークからダウンロードだけするプログラムが作られて無償配布されると、流出ファイルのお宝探しをしていた報道関係者たちが、Winnyを使うのではなく、ダウンロード専用プログラムを使うようになる。
これによって、ようやくマスメディアが、中継するだけでも違法性がある可能性について語り始める。それまではそれを語ることができなかった。なぜなら、Winnyの実態を報道するためにはWinnyを使わざるを得ず、Winnyの中継を違法ということにしてしまうと、自分の首を絞めることになるからだ。実態が報道されないのはより悪いことだ誰もが思うため、それまでは誰も（表では）そのことに触れないできた。
その状況を踏まえて、ネットランナー等がDOM（ダウンロードするだけの行為）を推奨する。DOMが増大し、DOMだけとなり、Winnyネットワークは消滅する。

today 's WSJ
, an excellent article by University of Rochester economist Steven Landsburg ( author of "
Armchair Economist
: Economics and Everyday Life " and "
More Sex is Safer Sex
: The Unconventional Wisdom of Economics , " and Slate.com columnist for " Everyday Economics " ) , here are some excerpts :
Modern humans first emerged about 100,000 years ago .
For the next 99,800 years or so , nothing happened .
Well , not quite nothing .
There were wars , political intrigue , the invention of agriculture -- but none of that stuff had much effect on the quality of people 's lives .
Almost everyone lived on the modern equivalent of $ 400 to $ 600 a year , just above the subsistence level .
( See graph above , click to enlarge . )
Then -- just a couple of hundred years ago , maybe 10 generations -- people started getting richer .
And richer and richer still .
Per capita income , at least in the West , began to grow at the unprecedented rate of about three quarters of a percent per year .
A couple of decades later , the same thing was happening around the world .
( See graph above . )
Then it got even better .
By the 20th century , per capita real incomes , that is , incomes adjusted for inflation , were growing at 1.5 % per year , on average , and for the past half century they 've been growing at about 2.3 % .
If you 're earning a modest middle - class income of $ 50,000 a year , and if you expect your children , 25 years from now , to occupy that same modest rung on the economic ladder , then with a 2.3 % growth rate , they 'll be earning the inflation - adjusted equivalent of $ 89,000 a year .
Their children , another 25 years down the line , will earn $ 158,000 a year .
The underlying expectation -- that the present is supposed to be better than the past -- is a new phenomenon in history .
No 18th - century politician would have asked " Are you better off than you were four years ago ? " because it never would have occurred to anyone that they ought to be better off than they were four years ago .
Rising income is only part of the story .
One hundred years ago the average American workweek was over 60 hours ; today it 's under 35 .
One hundred years ago 6 % of manufacturing workers took vacations ; today it 's over 90 % .
One hundred years ago the average housekeeper spent 12 hours a day on laundry , cooking , cleaning and sewing ; today it 's about three hours .
As far as the quality of the goods we buy , try picking up an electronics catalogue from , oh , say , 2001 and ask yourself whether there 's anything there you 'd want to buy .
That was the year my friend Ben spent $ 600 for a 1.3 - megapixel digital camera that weighed a pound and a half .
What about services , such as health care ?
Would you rather purchase today 's health care at today 's prices or the health care of , say , 1970 at 1970 prices ?
I do n't know any informed person who would choose 1970 , which means that despite all the hype about costs , health care now is a better bargain than it 's ever been before .
The moral is that increases in measured income -- even the phenomenal increases of the past two centuries -- grossly understate the real improvements in our economic condition .
The source of this wealth -- the engine of prosperity -- is technological progress .
And the engine of technological progress is ideas -- not just the ideas from engineering laboratories , but also ideas like new methods of crop rotation , or just - in - time inventory management .
Some good ideas even come from economists .
Julian Simon came up with the idea of bribing airline passengers to give up their seats on overbooked flights -- and gone were the days when you relied on the luck of the draw to make it to your daughter 's wedding .
Economists first suggested creating property rights in African elephants , a policy that has given villagers an incentive to harvest at a sustainable rate and drive the poachers away .
The result ?
Villagers have prospered and the elephant population has soared .
Engineers figure out how to harness the power of technology ; economists figure out how to harness the power of incentives .
Our prosperity relies on both .
See some previous CD posts on economic growth over time here , and here , and here .
Entering a supermarket here is a bizarre experience .
Shelves are fully stocked with Scotch whiskey , Argentine wines and imported cheeses like brie and Camembert , but basic staples like black beans and desirable cuts of beef like sirloin are often absent .
Customers , even those in the government ’s own Mercal chain of subsidized grocery stores , are left with choices like pork neck bones , rabbit and unusual cuts of lamb .
With shoppers limited to just two large packages of sugar , a black market in sugar has developed among street vendors in parts of Caracas .
“ This country is going to turn into Cuba , or Chávez will have to give in , ” said Cándida de Gómez , 54 , a shopper at a private supermarket in Los Palos Grandes , a district in the capital .
José Vielma Mora , the chief of Seniat , the government ’s tax agency , oversaw a raid this month on a warehouse here where officials seized about 165 tons of sugar .
Mr. Vielma said the raid exposed hoarding by vendors who were unwilling to sell the sugar at official prices .
He and other officials in Mr. Chávez ’s government have repeatedly blamed the shortages on producers , intermediaries and grocers .
Those in the food industry argue that the price controls prevented them from making a profit after inflation rose and the value of Venezuela ’s currency plunged in black market trading in recent weeks .
The bolívar , the country ’s currency , fell more than 30 percent to about 4,400 to the dollar in unofficial trading following Mr. Chávez ’s nationalization of Venezuela ’s main telephone company , CANTV , and its largest electric utility , Electricidad de Caracas .
Fears that more private companies could be nationalized have put further pressure on the currency as rich Venezuelans try to take money out of the country .
Concern over capital flight has made the government jittery , with vague threats issued to newspapers that publish unofficial currency rates ( officially the bolívar is quoted at about 2,150 to the dollar ) .
Regardless of efforts to stop illicit currency trading , the weaker bolívar has made imported food , fertilizers and agricultural equipment more expensive .
Venezuela , despite boasting some of South America ’s most fertile farmland , still imports more than half its food , largely from Argentina , Brazil , Colombia and the United States .
Supermarket owners expressed relief when the government this week cut value - added taxes on retail food sales and raised the prices on more than 100 staples in an effort to alleviate the shortages .
The announcement included an average 32 percent increase in beef prices and a 45 percent increase in chicken prices .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - An Internet parody of “ The Simpsons ” has drawn the ire of 20th Century Fox .
The studio is pressuring online video hub Broadcaster.com to remove “ The O.J. Simpsons , ” three animated clips that reimagine the Fox series starring the former football star .
After receiving notices from Fox lawyers , Broadcaster Inc. is reviewing their demand but noted Friday that fair - use doctrine protects parodies .
“ We respect the rights of content owners , ” Broadcaster CEO Martin Wade III said .
“ We are examining all the issues raised by the Fox request .
Our goal is to be a respecter of content rights and at the same time find legal ways to bring our community members the content they enjoy . ”
Fox , which declined comment , has been aggressive about protecting perceived copyright infringements .
In January , Fox had Google subpoenaed over uploaded episodes of “ 24 ” and “ Simpsons . ”
Google complied , disclosing the names of individuals who did the uploading .
The three “ O.J. Simpsons ” clips are titled “ Black and White Christmas , ” “ Warzone ” and “ If I Did It , ” which directly references Fox and its decision to withdraw publication of O.J. Simpson ’s proposed book about the murder of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and Ron Goldman .

Possibly , your boss is a truly fine person — wise , kind , perceptive , capable , understanding , the all - seeing director of the office sitcom , the sort of individual one might like to have , in an ideal world , as a parent or a confidant .
Or not .
In the real world , bosses are known to suffer from a long list of social pathologies : naked aggression , credit hogging , micromanaging , bullying , you name it .
According to one report , 60 to 75 percent of employees — it does n’t matter the organization — say the worst aspect of their job is their boss .
It ’s not difficult to believe , as one office expert concludes , that “ every employed adult will have to work for a bad boss for some significant period . ”
In the natural world , there are brutal processes by which , say , one especially vicious bull walrus ends up on the rock , with all the females , while all the others are forced to skulk around the periphery .
Dogs , we ’re told , inevitably select a leader , who emerges naturally through some mysterious language of dominance rituals , reinforced with tactical urination .
Could the same be true , somehow , in the world of work ?
Is there some law of office life that dictates that jerks rise to the top ?
In search of an answer , I began to explore the vast and ever - growing field of office psychology .
The field is packed with off - the - top - of - their - head pundits and latest - idea peddlers of all stripes .
Sprinkled among these are a few thinkers and scientists .
One of them is Seymour Adler , an industrial - organizational psychologist at Aon Consulting .
Adler is tall , talkative , and unassuming ; he wears large glasses , khakis , a shirt without a tie .
He has the mild look of a weekend boater .
And yet it does n’t take long to figure out that Adler is a kind of office utopian , who dreams of remaking the office cubicle by cubicle .
Adler is one of a brash , almost swaggering set of psychologists with a wildly ambitious goal : the perfection of the society of work .
“ The thrust of my research is to identify the traits required to be an effective leader , ” says Adler , “ and then systematically select those traits ” ; each according to his personality , if not exactly according to his needs .
Adler has a new set of scientific tools by which to remake the office .
“ There ’s been a revolution in thinking about personality , ” he tells me .
“ The revolution is how little of who we are is determined by nurture and how much is determined by genetics . ”
Psychologists are reducing personality to a linked series of statistical clusters that the research literature now confidently correlates with performance .
Essentially , Adler makes his living by helping companies decide which pegs should go into which holes .
Adler says he knows which personality traits help make for a responsive customer - service rep , which make for an eager salesman .
( Rule of thumb : Throw the obsessives into operations . )
That customer - service rep should have an agreeable , tolerant personality and one without deep ambition .
“ There ’s no incentive pay , ” Adler says .
The salesman probably should be achievement - oriented , someone who needs to prove himself against measurable goals .
In the same vein , another researcher reports that one law firm deconstructs its HR needs by personality traits .
It insists on extremely bright employees who are also extremely insecure .
“ They want them to think that working really hard matters , ” he explains .
Through this prism , personality types can even be mixed and matched to make a team function more efficiently .
Psychologist Robert Hogan , a pioneer in organizational psychology , says it ’s a matter of balance ; three basic types are required .
“ You need an ambitious person , someone who will step up .
You need someone inquisitive and with ideas .
Then you need one smoother - outer , a person who ’ll keep on task . ”
In this view , failure is nothing more than incompatibility .
Match the appropriate trait cluster to a well - understood task and you ’ll have rebuilt the office along rational lines .
Like other utopian visions , Adler ’s can seem profoundly inhumane — reducing people to a collection of qualities , manipulating them by identifying their weaknesses .
In a sense , it ’s a boss ’s vision .
Man Is Born Free , But Everywhere
He ’s Working for a Jerk
In many offices , the boss ’s focus tends to be on himself , in a mirror , heroically distorted .
Take Michael Scott , Steve Carell ’s character in The Office .
Scott is craven , self - admiring , clueless , the Ur-narcissist .
Others ’ feelings and talents register little , if at all .
Subordinates exist to serve — one , in fact , does Scott ’s laundry .
Scott ’s only redeeming trait is that he ’s a buffoon , the butt of the running joke .
Still — and this is a crucial insight into the narcissistic boss — he is among the few who do n’t see this .
“ Narcissists have unrealistically exaggerated views of their abilities and achievements , ” reports University of Florida professor Timothy Judge , whose 2006 study of narcissists was titled “ Loving Yourself Abundantly . ”
As a TV character , Scott is laughable , in part , because we assume no one quite like that could really be boss .
Yet the sad irony of office life is that a large and growing body of evidence argues that narcissistic personality traits are some of those that propel the jerk up the ladder .
Research suggests that he who climbs quickly is likely more talkative , social , and at the same time more obviously — obviously is the key word — dominant than his peers .
“ He answers to himself , ” as one management consultant puts it .
He ’s self - referential — “ I believe … ” is the way he starts most every sentence .
He has a talent for manipulating others ’ impressions .
One way he sometimes does that is by flashing a little anger .
“ Leadership research shows that subtle nasty moves like glaring and condescending comments , explicit moves like insults or put - downs , and even physical intimidation can be effective paths to power , ” reports Robert Sutton , a Stanford professor and author of The No Asshole Rule .
And so , the research shows , employees tend to see the jerk , the narcissist , and yes , even the asshole , as boss material .
“ Yeah , the narcissist has advantages , ” Adler says , as if fingering a nemesis .
Most important among them , the narcissist believes that it ’s his natural right to be the boss .
“ Narcissism , ” says Adler , his hands flapping the air , “ makes a person feel that he should be a leader .
He ’s the one motivated to sell himself to peers . ”
Certainly no one in the corporate - psychology business wants to be seen as soft - minded about nasty , brutish workplace tactics .
If the jerk who shoves others aside to rise in fact makes the best boss , so be it .
If employees have to suffer , so be it .
That ’s why they call it work .
But the one who reaches the top fastest does n’t necessarily make the best boss .
A foundational bit of research on this issue was done by Fred Luthans at the University of Nebraska .
“ What do successful managers — those who have been promoted relatively quickly — have in common with effective managers — those who have satisfied , committed subordinates and high - performing units ? ” asked Luthans .
“ Surprisingly , the answer seems to be that they have little in common . ”
And the problem is n’t easily controlled .
Dysfunction at the top tends to infect an organization .
When the boss is disagreeable , disagreeableness spreads .
Sutton and others see assholicness as a disease vector .
“ There ’s powerful evidence from longitudinal studies that if you ’re around jerky people you ’ll become like them if you do n’t leave , ” Sutton tells me .
“ Specifically , studies show that if you work for a bully boss , you will become a bully .
“ Being an asshole , ” he says flatly , “ is a contagious disease . ”
We Hold the Boss to Be Self - Evident
The fact that the boss was a bastard did n’t used to make such a difference .
Dad , the Organization Man , put in his time at the office — he called it the grind , the rat race — then caught the 5:14 home to an armful of kids .
That one ’s boss was an old - fashioned authoritarian , a yeller , and possibly not the smartest guy in the room was simply part of the natural order .
At your job , you were a cog , a tool .
Life took place at home .
That idea took a couple of decades to die , but by the nineties it was clear that work was viewed differently .
It became a place ( perhaps the place ) where people look for personal fulfillment .
The office , by this view , is n’t a big anonymous organization to be tinkered with by engineers ; it ’s as intimate as a family .
In this paradigm there is no room for the boss - as - tyrant .
Leadership books of the nineties , The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People , by Stephen Covey , and Daniel Goleman ’s Emotional Intelligence , often cast the boss as a kind of ideal parent .
Soon , books with titles like Growing Great Employees would take up more and more real estate on the business bookshelves .
One talks of a boss who “ believ[es ] in people ’s potential and want [s ] to help them grow . ”
Another book says the boss ought to be like the Buddha ; it suggests the key to leadership is “ loving kindness . ”
In the same vein , “ servant leadership ” has recently become a popular term ; the idea is that the boss serves his employees .
Not all office psychologists have a lot of patience with this theme .
“ Where do they get this stuff ?
Do they make it up ? ” asks Hogan .
For these psychologists , the personality is a deconstructible combination of five sets of traits : openness , conscientiousness , extroversion , agreeableness , neuroticism .
( Conveniently , they spell OCEAN . )
These traits are statistical clusters that can describe every one of us .
And also predict leadership .
Researchers have found a moderate correlation between each of the five traits and the effective boss .
But when the traits were amalgamated into a kind of personality profile , their predictive power proved stronger than intelligence , a quality every boss is supposed to have .
And yet , in their hardheaded way , organization psychologists incorporate their own version of the touchy - feely vibe .
For the effective boss , openness may be the most important personality trait .
Someone high in openness , as the expression goes , is open to new experiences , new ideas , new people .
He ’s not dogmatic .
He likes diversity .
He ’s not a routinized taskmaster barking orders down the organizational chart .
Organizations change quickly these days .
They ’re supposed to be nimble , and bosses are , too .
The conscientious person shows up on time , he meets deadlines , he ’s got a good work ethic .
He ’s a dependable achiever .
Conscientiousness may be most significant when climbing the ladder , less so when you ’re at the top .
Then , apparently , others can be conscientious , just as others can be agreeable .
The agreeable person likes everyone and enjoys being liked .
It ’s a great trait for the team member , less important for the boss .
In fact , effective leadership correlates with low agreeableness .
Someone high in neuroticism is a natural alarmist .
He ’s antsy and prone to anxiety .
He ’s the office catastrophist ; something is always going wrong .
“ I ’m working with a hospital now , ” says Adler .
“ You do n’t want a hospital run by neurotics emoting stress all the time .
You ca n’t project urgency . ”
“ Managers are rarely promoted based on their talent for leadership , ” says Hogan .
The challenge is to sort out effective leaders from effective climbers .
When it comes to whether one personality is good or bad , nice or mean , the organizational psychologist is agnostic .
Given certain situations , you may want a neurotic boss .
“ What is good about a neurotic ? ” asks Adler .
“ Our research shows that neurotics are emotionally expressive .
They ’re candid and honest , and have a sense of urgency .
Sometimes that ’s exaggerated , which creates unnecessary anxiety , but other times it has a place . ”
Take financial services , which is subject to market fluctuations worldwide .
“ You need to operate in conditions of uncertainty , ” says Adler .
“ In this case , a sense of anxiety , of alert , is not a negative .
If you are not neurotic , maybe you ca n’t create a sense of urgency . ”
So your boss on the trading desk may be a yeller with a short fuse .
That , quite possibly , is bad for the heart - disease rate , but good for business .
Adler and his colleagues sometimes observe the nuances of the different personalities by putting a dozen people in an ordinary conference room , the usual bland office setting with the firm ’s founder pictured on the wall , a pitcher of water on the large rectangular table .
The drill is to give them an hour to choose a location for a new office , or some other task .
Then ask the group to vote for a leader .
The exercise mirrors the way bosses are often chosen .
In its purest form , the purpose is to observe how the group interacts when there ’s no structure .
It ’s Lord of the Flies in a conference room .
“ We study people exerting power ” is how Adler puts it .
Often you find the Big Five represented .
There ’s at least one agreeable personality .
He may have the best ideas but presents them politely , even meekly .
There ’s that neurotic , watching the clock .
He ’s the emotional one , his voice rising .
There ’s an achiever ( an element of conscientiousness ) .
He ’s full of ideas and determined to figure out the best result .
There might be an obsessive , taking notes , making sure everyone sticks to the topic .
Invariably from this mix one person emerges as a leader figure , often the same type of person .
The researchers call the person who wins the nod “ an emergent leader , ” which they distinguish from “ effective leader . ”
The effective leader will be suited by personality to manage others .
The emergent leader seems bosslike , and , most of the time , gets the job .
He ’s the successful climber .
But will he be the effective boss ?
The Origins of Office Totalitarianism
“ Leaderless - group research provides virtually no information about the effectiveness [ of the leader ] , ” says Hogan .
“ Rather it tells us about what a person must do in order to be perceived as leaderlike . ”
It turns out that people , including those who do the hiring , select bosses based on what they think bosses should be .
Hogan points out : “ Managers are rarely promoted based on their talent for leadership . ”
The challenge is to go beyond the leaderless group and sort out the emergent from the effective leader ; the successful climber from the good boss .
The difficulty , as Luthans discovered , is that there is little overlap between the great climber and the great leader ; 10 percent is all he found .
The narcissist , inevitably , performs well in the conference - room experiment , partly because the narcissist manages to act like he already is the boss .
In leaderless groups ( as at dinner parties ) he ’s an expert , which he does n’t mind letting you know .
Think of Harvey Pitt when he was the embattled SEC chairman .
“ It would be unthinkable to deprive people of my expertise , ” he said , a few months before being forced to resign .
At heart , the emergent leader might not particularly value people .
But he seems to listen and to care .
He is , in the language of the trade , a high self - monitor , a gifted manager of perceptions , a winning quality in a leaderless group .
He ’s got a sixth sense — “ at the blink level , ” says Adler — for knowing what people want to hear .
Or , as Sutton explains , “ narcissists are socially skilled at adjusting their personality . ”
Still , perhaps the most prominent characteristic of the emergent leader — the engine of the rest — is that he seems charismatic .
“ I can light up a room with my eyes , ” one narcissist confided to Robert Kaiser , co-author , with Hogan , of The Versatile Leader .
People love charisma , the sense of something big , alive , engaging .
Freud was probably the first to point out that the narcissist is “ the type of person who impresses us as a personality . ”
We not only want our boss to like us , we want to like him .
In this regard , charisma is like fairy dust .
And so the guy with the narcissistic instincts , with personal command and an ability to fill up a room ( especially a leaderless one ) , gets the tap on the shoulder .
And that ’s where the calamity begins .
Sadly , once he is the boss , the narcissist often sees the job as a stepping - stone to the next one .
Climbers climb .
They do n’t even do the same job as the effective manager .
As one told Luthans , “ I find that the way to get ahead around here is to be friendly with the right people … I find a common interest … and interact with them on that level .
The other formal stuff around the office is important , but I really work at this informal side and have found it pays off when promotion time rolls around . ”
Charisma may be an asset for the climber , but it does n’t necessarily help the manager .
“ Four scholarly studies have examined charisma , ” says Kaiser .
“ Not a single one finds charisma and performance linked .
The only thing charisma correlates to is high salary . ”
The promise of the new office psychologists is that they can do something about the self - absorbed guy before he gets to the top .
Personalities do n’t change , they know ; better to eliminate those you do n’t want before they strike .
For this , the tool of choice is the business simulation , a kind of business video game .
Aon , where Adler works , has its own proprietary version , called the Leader .
A candidate sits in front of a computer and a phone , the modern manager ’s tools .
A video pops up on the screen .
It ’s a supervisor behind on a product development .
He wants to borrow another team ’s engineer .
Who is this guy ?
What ’s the project ?
The executive candidate has to dig into the e-mails , the organization chart .
Meanwhile , the phone rings .
It ’s one of his reports calling for a scheduled job - performance discussion , a role played by one of the test administrators .
The simulation tests intelligence and skills .
The real purpose , though , is to filter out personality traits .
“ We determine which is your preferred style , ” he says .
“ We ca n’t change it .
But we can measure it . ”
Companies look for different personalities , but not many want the thoroughgoing narcissist .
( And watch out :
There is no more toxic colleague than a thwarted narcissist , with his rage and sense of victimization . )
There ’s a no- asshole rule , as the popularity of Sutton ’s book suggests .
And here , apparently , the enemy can be met .
“ We ’re likely to spot them and red - flag them , ” says Adler , “ and the odds are they wo n’t make it to a top spot . ”
Workers of the World , Unite !
You Have Nothing to Lose But Your Jobs .
The truth is that many employees are utopians of a kind , too .
No one wants to work with ego monsters .
The office is still supposed to be a kingdom of fairness where no one ’s feelings get hurt and everyone gets the same portion .
Excellence is an end , but not the only one .
Teamwork is our watchword ; we are all proud , busy collaborators .
The office , in this view , is a happy tribe sharing everything , making decisions communally , with the same worldview , the same DNA .
Some studies inevitably buttress this conception .
People are more satisfied in their jobs if they like their co-workers .
If they fit in , they tend to stay longer .
“ There is powerful evidence from longitudinal studies of accounting firms that the people who fit the culture better have lower turnover and better performance , ” says Sutton .
But should the office really be a welcoming mother ship full of happy people and groovy background music ?
Organizations can slip toward homogeneity , not only in race or gender , but in personality .
In the absence of objective criteria , search committees tend to select people they like .
And they like people who resemble them .
What ’s more , the research shows that people who are already similar tend to grow increasingly alike the more time they spend together .
The office moves toward sameness — comforting for the employee , but is it healthy for the organization ?
A body of research holds that complacency , the kind that results when everyone gets along , depletes workplace energy just as much , perhaps , as office strife .
In nature , randomness creates a robust system .
Boot out the uncongenial and you end up with a kind of office inbreeding .
The idea pool shrinks with the personality pool .
“ You end with people who are going to be followers , ” as Michael Maccoby , author of The Productive Narcissist , puts it .
Simply put , you need a strong leader .
The boss - as - guidance - counselor with nurturing instincts may be the rage , but a strong leader stirs the pot .
Maccoby , who has been writing about leadership for the better part of four decades , extols the virtues of the narcissist ’s selfishness , ethical blindness , and lack of empathy as indispensable to being an agent of change in a large corporation — or the world .
To move the cheese , a strong man is needed .
The book is a paean to strong leadership of a kind that Leni Riefenstahl might have admired .
That is not an employee ’s point of view ; we like the person who waits his turn .
And seeing as there are more employees than leaders , this may be why books about asshole bosses tend to sell so well .
And yet , anyone can see , rationally , that unless the cheese is sometimes displaced , no one will end up with anything to eat .
And the best person to move the cheese , the only person with the inner strength , is the narcissist .
Narcissism can work .
The narcissistic boss does n’t tend his employees ’ sensitive inner selves .
For him , it ’s all about the means .
The process may be brutal .
The ends justify the means .
Hollywood producer Scott Rudin , who ’s fired over a hundred assistants , says , “ It ’s impossible to get to the level I want to get to without making a lot of enemies . ”
Andrew Grove , Intel co-founder , encourages bosses to be blowhards , oozing confidence , even when they ’re wrong .
“ Act on your temporary conviction as if it was a real conviction , ” he says , and when you change convictions , act sure of that one , too .
Of course , the organizational psychologist is onboard ( the boss pays him , remember ? ) .
He ’s no sentimentalist .
( “ The office is a family ?
No , ” says Adler . )
He does n’t care about our happiness unless it adds to return on investment .
He wants the machine to work .
“ The question is n’t necessarily , ‘ Is narcissism bad ? , ’ ” says Timothy Judge , the University of Florida professor , “ but rather , ‘ In what ways is narcissism bad and in what ways is it good ? ’ ”
Because , after all , it ’s a tragic fact of the human condition that the world changes , the cheese gets moved , and someone has to move it .
Which is why your office , whatever else it is , will never be a Utopia .

Illustration by Riccardo Vecchio __With the Library of America 's __publication of Philip K. Dick : Four Novels of the 1960s — edited by Jonathan Lethem , whose own early fiction owes a lot to Dick 's — the most outré science fiction writer of the 20th century has finally entered the canon .
The Man in the High Castle , Dick 's coolly rendered imaginings of Japanese - Nazi confrontation in occupied America , was his breakthrough work .
The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch and Ubik established him as one of the most hallucinatory yet insightful critics of late - capitalist American civilization .
And Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? inspired the film Blade Runner .
Wired caught Lethem as he was promoting his latest novel , You Don't Love Me Yet , to ask about this sanctification of Dick 's oeuvre — or as Lethem calls it , his " irv . "
Wired : Vintage has some three dozen Philip K. Dick novels in print .
So , why collect these four ?
Lethem :
For a great writer , the marginal stuff should be available — and Dick 's a great writer .
But because he was so prolific , the masterpieces now nestle up alongside books that Dick himself might have been horrified to see back in print .
You cringe on behalf of the potentially receptive reader who comes away with Dr. Futurity or The Cosmic Puppets .
Wired :
What was it that made his early works so bad ?
Lethem :
He was expending his energies on these unpublished realist novels .
What happened with The Man in the High Castle was that he invigorated his science fiction with all the ambition he'd been reserving for his mainstream efforts .
Suddenly , he vaulted up to this other level .
Wired :
You discovered him as a teen ?
Lethem : I found a copy of Ubik in a used bookstore .
That changed my life .
It was a book - length metaphor for feelings that were churning within me .
Turning the pages — all epiphany , all the time .
Wired :
Do you think Dick would have been better received if he were writing today ?
__Lethem : __It 's easy to say he'd be Don DeLillo , but he 's so deeply of his time .
And I do n't think it 's an accident that he was so marginal .
There was something about him that was deeply fugitive .
It 's hard to believe in a Dick who 's been domesticated into a life of literary prestige the way we are currently domesticating him .

Kevin Mitnick
An excerpt from Takedown .
Who is Kevin Mitnick ?
The picture that emerged after his arrest in Raleigh , N.C. last February was of a 31 - year old computer programmer , who had been given a number of chances to get his life together but each time was seduced back to the dark side of the computer world .
Kevin David Mitnick reached adolescence in suburban Los Angeles in the late 1970s , the same time the personal computer industry was exploding beyond its hobbyist roots .
His parents were divorced , and in a lower - middle - class environment that lacked adventure and in which he was largely a loner and an underachiever , he was seduced by the power he could gain over the telephone network .
The underground culture of phone phreaks had already flourished for more than a decade , but it was now in the middle of a transition from the analog to the digital world .
Using a personal computer and modem it became possible to commandeer a phone company 's digital central office switch by dialing in remotely , and Kevin became adept at doing so .
Mastery of a local telephone company switch offered more than just free calls :
It opened a window into the lives of other people to eavesdrop on the rich and powerful , or on his own enemies .
Mitnick soon fell in with an informal phone phreak gang that met irregularly in a pizza parlor in Hollywood .
Much of what they did fell into the category of pranks , like taking over directory assistance and answering operator calls by saying , " Yes , that number is eight - seven - five - zero and a half .
Do you know how to dial the half , ma'am ? " or changing the class of service on someone 's home phone to payphone status , so that whenever they picked up the receiver a recorded voice asked them to deposit twenty cents .
But the group seemed to have a mean streak as well .
One of its members destroyed files of a San Francisco - based computer time - sharing company , a crime that went unsolved for more than a year -- until a break - in at a Los Angeles telephone company switching center led police to the gang .
The case was actually solved when a jilted girlfriend of one of the gang went to the police ...
That break - in occurred over Memorial Day weekend in 1981 , when Kevin and two friends decided to physically enter Pacific Bell 's COSMOS phone center in downtown Los Angeles .
COSMOS , or Computer System for Mainframe Operations , was a database used by many of the nation 's phone companies for controlling the phone system 's basic recordkeeping functions .
The group talked their way past a security guard and ultimately found the room where the COSMOS system was located .
Once inside they took lists of computer passwords , including the combinations to the door locks at nine Pacific Bell central offices and a series of operating manuals for the COSMOS system ..
To facilitate later social engineering they planted their pseudonyms and phone numbers in a rolodex sitting on one of the desks in the room .
With a flourish one of the fake names they used was " John Draper , " who was an actual computer programmer also known as the legendary phone phreak , Captain Crunch , the phone numbers were actually misrouted numbers that would ring at a coffee shop pay phone in Van Nuys .
The crime was far from perfect , however .
A telephone company manager soon discovered the phony numbers and reported them to the local police , who started an investigation .
The case was actually solved when a jilted girlfriend of one of the gang went to the police , and Kevin and his friends were soon arrested .
The group was charged with destroying data over a computer network and with stealing operator 's manuals from the telephone company .
Kevin , 17 years old at the time , was relatively lucky , and was sentenced to spend only three months in the Los Angeles Juvenile Detention Center , followed by a year 's probation .
A run-in with the police might have persuaded most bright kids to explore the many legal ways to have computer adventures , but Mitnick appeared to be obsessed by some twisted vision .
Rather than developing his computer skills in creative and productive ways , he seemed interested only in learning enough short - cuts for computer break - ins and dirty tricks to continue to play out a fantasy that led to collision after collision with the police throughout the 1980s .
He obviously loved the attention and the mystique his growing notoriety was bringing .
Early on , after seeing the 1975 Robert Redford movie Three Days of the Condor , he had adopted Condor as his nom de guerre .
In the film Redford plays the role of a hunted CIA researcher who uses his experience as an Army signal corpsman to manipulate the phone system and avoid capture .
Mitnick seemed to view himself as the same kind of daring man on the run from the law .
After he was released , he obtained the license plate " X HACKER " for his Nissan ...
His next arrest was in 1983 by campus police at the University of Southern California , where he had gotten into minor trouble a few years earlier , when he was caught using a university computer to gain illegal access to the ARPAnet .
This time he was discovered sitting at a computer in a campus terminal room , breaking into a Pentagon computer over the ARPAnet , and was sentenced to six months at the California Youth Authority 's Karl Holton Training School , a juvenile prison in Stockton , California .
After he was released , he obtained the license plate " X HACKER " for his Nissan but he was still very much in the computer break - in business .
Several years later he went underground for more than a year after being accused of tampering with a TRW credit reference computer ; an arrest warrant was issued , but it later vanished from police records without explanation .
By 1987 , Mitnick seemed to be making an effort to pull his life together , and he began living with a woman who was taking a computer class with him at a local vocational school .
After a while , however , his obsession drew him back , and this time his use of illegal telephone credit card numbers led police investigators to the apartment he was sharing with his girlfriend in Thousand Oaks , California .
He was convicted of stealing software from the Santa Cruz Operation , a California software company , and in December 1987 , he was sentenced to 36 months probation .
That brush with the police , and the resultant wrist slap , seemed only increase his sense of omnipotence .
In 1987 and 1988 , Kevin and a friend , Lenny DiCicco , fought a pitched electronic battle against scientists at Digital Equipment 's Palo Alto research laboratory .
Mitnick had become obsessed with obtaining a copy of Digital 's VMS minicomputer operating system , and was trying to do so by gaining entry to the company 's corporate computer network , known as Easynet .
The computers at Digital 's Palo Alto laboratory looked easiest , so every night with remarkable persistence Mitnick and DiCicco would launch their modem attacks from a small Calabasas , California company where DiCicco had a computer support job .
Although Reid discovered the attacks almost immediately , he did n't know where they were coming from , nor did the local police or FBI , because Mitnick was manipulating the telephone network 's switches to disguise the source of the modem calls .
...he agreed to one year in prison and six months in a counseling program for his computer " addiction . "
The FBI can easily serve warrants and get trap - and - trace information from telephone companies , but few of its agents know how to interpret the data they provide .
If the bad guy is actually holed up at the address that corresponds to the telephone number , they 're set .
But if the criminal has electronically broken into to the telephone company 's local switch and scrambled the routing tables , they 're clueless .
Kevin had easily frustrated their best attempts at tracking him through the telephone network using wiretaps and traces .
He would routinely use two computer terminals each night -- one for his forays into Digital 's computers , the other as a lookout that scanned the telephone company computers to see if his trackers were getting close .
At one point , a team of law enforcement and telephone security agents thought they had tracked him down , only to find that Mitnick had diverted the telephone lines so as to lead his pursuers not to his hideout in Calabasas , but to an apartment in Malibu .
Mitnick , it seemed , was a tough accomplice , for even as they had been working together he had been harassing DiCicco by making fake calls to DiCicco 's employer , claiming to be a Government agent and saying that DiCicco was in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service .
The frustrated DiCicco confessed to his boss , who notified DEC and the FBI , and Mitnick soon wound up in federal court in Los Angeles .
Although DEC claimed that he had stolen software worth several million dollars , and had cost DEC almost $ 200,000 in time spent trying to keep him out of their computers , Kevin pleaded guilty to one count of computer fraud and one count of possessing illegal long - distance access codes .
It was the fifth time that Mitnick had been apprehended for a computer crime , and the case attracted nationwide attention because , in an unusual plea bargain , he agreed to one year in prison and six months in a counseling program for his computer " addiction . "
It was a strange defense tactic , but a federal judge , after initially balking , bought the idea that there was some sort of psychological parallel between the obsession Mitnick had for breaking in to computer systems and an addict 's craving for drugs .
After he finished his jail time and his halfway - house counseling sentence for the 1989 Digital Equipment conviction Mitnick moved to Las Vegas and took a low - level computer programming position for a mailing list company .
His mother had moved there , as had a woman who called herself Susan Thunder who had been part of Mitnick 's phone phreak gang in the early 1980s , and with whom he now became reacquainted .
It was during this period that he tried to " social engineer " me over the phone .
In early 1992 Mitnick moved back to the San Fernando Valley area after his half - brother died of an apparent heroin overdose .
He briefly worked for his father in construction , but then took a job he found through a friend of his father 's at the Tel Tec Detective Agency .
Soon after he began , someone was discovered illegally using a commercial database system on the agency 's behalf , and Kevin was once again the subject of an FBI investigation .
In September the Bureau searched his apartment , as well as the home and workplace of another member of the original phone phreak gang .
Two months later a federal judge issued a warrant for Mitnick 's arrest for having violated the terms of his 1989 probation .
There were two charges : illegally accessing a phone company computer , and associating with one of the people with whom he 'd originally been arrested in 1981 .
His friends claimed Mitnick had been set up by the detective firm ; whatever the truth , when the FBI came to arrest him , Kevin Mitnick had vanished .
His escape , subsequently reported in the Southern California newspapers , made the authorities look like bumblers who were no match for a brilliant and elusive cyberthief .
In late 1992 someone called the California Department of Motor Vehicles office in Sacramento , and using a valid law enforcement requester code , attempted to have driver 's license photographs of a police informer faxed to a number in Studio City , near Los Angeles .
Smelling fraud , D.M.V. security officers checked the number and discovered that it was assigned to a Kinko 's copy shop , which they staked out before faxing the photographs .
But somehow the spotters did n't see their quarry until he was going out the door of the copy shop .
They started after him , but he outran them across the parking lot and disappeared around the corner , dropping the documents as he fled .
The agents later determined that they were covered with Kevin Mitnick 's fingerprints .
His escape , subsequently reported in the Southern California newspapers , made the authorities look like bumblers who were no match for a brilliant and elusive cyberthief .

A caucasian actor -- made to look Japanese -- sits behind a desk and tells us that Americans have many misconceptions about the Japanese people ( for example , that a Japanese actor would willingly play this role ) .
" We do n't have big teeth and thick glasses , " he hisses through his taped - back cheeks .
He then proceeds to show us what Japan and the Japanese are REALLY like .
" You think you can defeat us by wiping out a few , inexpensive lives , " he snickers .
" We are not like you ! "
As we are shown what the narrator claims is captured Japanese war footage , we are told that that the Japanese people are brutally " realistic , " and willing to sacrifice everything for their ultimate goal -- " to win the war . "
The narrator mocks Americans as being too soft -- a nation of dreamers .
" We think you 're stupid ! " he snorts .
" You can destroy Japan 's cities with your bombs , but you cannot destroy its heart ! "
Were the producers of this film trying to create an American version of Japanese propaganda ?
Or were they told to create something that would justify ( at least in the public 's mind ) America 's anticipated bloody invasion of Japan ?
Whatever its makers ' intentions , My Japan stands as a unique -- and decidedly racist -- film .
My Japan , one of the most unusual documentary films ever made , dares to question America 's invincibility .
But I wonder whether in fact it 's the unheralded first film of the atomic age .
Is it too far out to imagine that its real purpose was to desensitize Americans to the horrors of the A - bomb ?
By citing American weaknesses and vulnerabilities and seeming to praise Japanese patriotism , strength and resolve , it challenges Americans to support a strategy of total war .
Its stealthy assertion : that the Japanese military machine will not be broken without an unprecedented effort .
It supports this assertion by presenting highly charged and emotional images with an bogus " insider " narration that is at once deceptive and inflammatory .
My Japan is constructed largely from newsreel film , combat photography and captured Japanese images .
To most of us today , it all looks pretty much like old black - and - white stock footage .
What we do n't remember is the power that many of its images used to carry in the public mind .
During World War II , images of the Japanese siege of Nanking , China were often used to inflame anti-Japanese passions .
Shots of the attack on Pearl Harbor fulfilled the same function ; at the war 's outset they were embargoed by American authorities , who feared the consequences of showing images of an America caught unawares and defeated .
When it later became possible to recontextualize Pearl Harbor as a focus of anger and popular vengeance , the shots were seen over and over again .
Unlike many other World War II propaganda films , My Japan shows actual atrocities -- executions , beheaded heads and bodies , the stumps of severed limbs .
The mobilization of all of these inflammatory images , and more , supports the idea that this film advocates total war against Japan .
" So ... you are the enemy ... " .
How many films begin so provocatively ?
War creates , and then is sustained by , two levels of enemies .
One , the actual military opponent on the battlefield , constructs itself .
The other level of enemy , the dehumanized " Other , " is a creation of our own minds , often aided by propaganda .
Constructing an enemy is a sophisticated effort that employs crude tactics : ignorance , oversimplification , and simplistic appeals to patriotism .
And patriotism itself often draws strength from the existence of a constructed enemy .
Wartime media show the pervasiveness of this process ; the evidence is on this disc in the Archives section under " Constructing an Enemy . "
Advertisements similar to those shown in that supplement were deemed too sensitive to include in Life magazine 's recent reprints of some 1945 issues .
A review of Gulf War news coverage will show , however , that this process is still in fashion .
It 's understandable , whether or not justifiable , that warring nations divide the world into allies and enemies .
But the " enemy " as pictured in My Japan is more than simply an opposing army .
" You cannot destroy Japan , " says the narrator in his ersatz accent , " because you cannot destroy the Japanese people . "
And the Japanese people are , in the film 's twisted way , pictured as an inhuman race , without compassion , and described as tireless , fanatical workers who lack the desire and capacity for leisure and enjoyment .
" They work longer hours than you do , twice as long , quite often .
Why not ?
They 're not working for the clock .
They 're working to win the war . "
But these characterizations of an enemy are not based on any kind of reality .
Rather , they are created in relation to some supposed American weaknesses : " How we suffer when you do not have a full tank of gasoline .
How devastated we are at the sight of you jammed into pleasure trains .
How we tremble when you have to wait to get into the movies , restaurants and nightclubs .... You are a nation of bargain - hunters . "
Our anger at finding ourselves too materialistic and selfish is invoked so that it can be turned against the enemy of the moment .
My Japan adopts the pretense that the " Japanese " narrator is confiding in us , telling us secrets , exposing the true nature of his society .
" Captured Japanese film " is invoked , furthering the " insider " feeling .
It pretends to be a critique of popular consciousness , to deconstruct a myth .
" How sad to disillusion you ... and how easy , easy because you do not know the Japanese , you only think you do , and you 're wrong . "
" We are Japan -- a mountain , a spiderweb , a flame that feeds on hate of you . "
My Japan charges the Japanese with atrocious conduct , but is itself charged with viciousness and brutality , both in the images it presents and in the way it 's edited .
Its producers ( whose identities are unknown ) were skilled polemicists , geniuses who , in their own way , were as evilly minded as the killers represented in the footage .
Ultimately , My Japan sets the stage for total war .
It implies that nothing less will be sufficient to defeat an enemy like Japan .
And this is the argument that was invoked to support the decision to drop the atomic bomb ; an argument that resurfaced in summer 1995 around an exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution recalling the bomber Enola Gay .
We cannot know whether My Japan 's producers were privy to the secrets of the Manhattan Project , but we can assert that propagandists bear as much responsibility as generals .

Subject : I feel sorry for anyone who buys into this garbage ..
While I would perhaps , in some sense , agree with the rightwing nut - jobs that have already commented that dropping the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were plenty justified , specifically , to end the war and ultimately bring about peace , albeit an intensely uneasy peace ; the intense hatred that this short film was obviously meant to increase , set fire to , and instill in the viewing audience of the day itself permeates with an intense bigotry that anyone with a working brain can not deny !
This film is not a cognitive & freethinking being , with it 's own thoughts , opinions , and ideology / ies .
But , it is very much a representative of the hatred that it spews forth ...
It in principle is the exact same thing as the confederate flag !
How anyone can believe , and furthermore express , some developmentally stunted , politically and socially ignorant , bloated and putrid bag of hot air is something that never ceases to amaze me ...
Those that say that this film is not racist express their own form of racism as they defend this piece of pro-racist , pro-xenophobic , propaganda .
I can perhaps not recommend highly enough that anyone with such a point of view do a gut check on their sense of right and wrong .
If you find that you have none , or if you find that it is so warped that it is beyond redemption , then it is unfortunately apparent that you should cut off and / or out your sexual organs so that you will not contaminate the rest of the human race ; it just IS the right thing to do !

Reviewer : Okii onara - favorite favorite favorite favorite - September 17 , 2010
Subject : A lesser known historical sidebar Many of the reviewers of " My Japan " have alluded to the two nuclear attacks as the defining cause of Japan 's surrender .
Perhaps so , historians differ , but the American planners of the final invasion , " Operation Downfall , " plotted without the surety of knowing if the bombs would actually work as hoped .
Concurrently , the Japanese counter - invasion plan , " Operation Ketsugo , " called for an organized homeland army of seven million , supported by as many as twelve million partially trained but equally impassioned civilian milita forces .
Of these almost twenty million Japanese , four million were positioned in well prepared defensive positions within sixty miles of the selected invasion beaches of southern Kyushu .
All in all , a fearsome force .
American casuality estimates covering the initial invasion and one month thereafter ranged from a little less than 200,000 to a high of one million with the accepted consensus being approximately 600,000 .
Fatality estimates were placed at twenty percent of all of these totals .
Without assurance of nuclear success , what new weapon might the Americans employ to oversome the expected scope of Japanese defense ?
The answer , certainly never well advertised , lie in chemical agents .
Quite obviously , in mid 1945 the 1916 - 1917 agony of gas warfare at Passchendale and Ypres remained a hideous memory to the populations of all the Allied nations .
Nevertheless , in secrecy accelerated production of VX , Serin and other nerve agents commenced and a vast inventory of the less deadly sulfur mustard gases was readied for deployment .
The unexpected end of hostilities posed a significant disposal problem for these chemical agents .
An immediate destruction effort was complicated by the onset of the Cold War which suggested there may ultimately be a new enemy for their use .
The bombs , miles , shells and rockets containing the gaseous horrors went into protected bunkers on far off Johnston Island and several remote rural sites in the United States .
Perhaps we have seen the light .
Through treaty with Russia , successor to the Soviet Union , massive and mutual chemical agent disposal programs started in the first decade of the 21st Century .
This week as I drove serenely along I - 84 on the shore of the mighty Columbia River from small Hermiston , Oregon toward Portland I once again viewed the hundreds upon hundreds of turf - covered , low - lying dark bunkers buried in the grounds of the Umatilla Army Depot .
If we can believe the forecasts of the US Army Corps of Engineers and the firm with the federal contract for the destruction work , all of the most lethal nerve agents have been destroyed and weapons containing the sulfur mustard compounds are due for total descruction by 2014 .
So far no leaks , no deaths and no major labor injuries .
Similar claims are made for the Russian stockpiles .
A touch of local gallows humor in far eastern Oregon is that that location represents the purest form of democratic freedom of choice .
One can select his / her preference ... asphyxiation from the gases at Umatilla or radiation from the residual ground leaching of plutonium at the decommissioned nuclear production complex at Hanford , Washington , twenty miles north .
Onward and upward !

This is an interesting period piece .
It was apparently made in the late spring / early summer of 1945 to prepare Americans for the anticipated
invasion of the Japanese home islands , which was scheduled for November , 1945 .
One gathers that the script writers reflected government concern that American war fervor might be waning in the wake of Germany 's surrender and the devastation
of Japanese cities .
The message : the invasion of Japan proper will be a bloody affair , so be ready .
It will be like 1000 Iwo Jimas .

is what underlay the decision to drop the atom bombs .

Pathetic .

There was NO other way to deal with a Demonic and Sadistic Enemy .
While the narrator is a tad corny - the Religoious and Political extremism portrayed in this movie is EXACTLY what the Japanese felt in their hearts .
They were SERIOUS about what they fought for .
The Japanese felt that their Emperor was DIVINE and the only true " Son of Heaven " - a sort of God Man .
They felt it their honor bound duty to bring by FORCE all of the " inferior races " of the world into total subjection to the " Son of Heaven " .
We are facing the same thing today with Radical Islamic Fascism .
Like the Japanese of WW2 the Islamic Sadists will DIE to bring about a world Islamic State .
They are NOT afraid to die to bring about their world view into existence .
Unfortunately we lack the Testicular Fortitude of our Great Grandparents who dealt with the Japanese in the only means that was effective .

Where to start ?
Until ' My Japan ' , I had never seen an American WWII propaganda film that took this type of approach to shake up the audience .
Its clever use of selected footage while listening to the " Japanese " narrator 's " Japanese " point of view was designed to promote hatred , boost American enlistment , validate bombing in Japan and increase war funding in one fell swoop .
Then I started reading the posts .
While I was n't shocked as to the volume of posts , I was appalled to see the apparent animosity that a 40s piece was still able to effectively bring to the surface .
I observed that the majority of the posters were more interested in berating one another than contributing something pertaining to this film , turning it into a political shouting match .
Worse still , I 'm not sure some viewers knew the Japanese monologue in ' My Japan ' was written by Americans .
Pretty sad stuff indeed .
Almost as sad as Japanese guy 's accent .
Apparently he did n't pass YellowFace 101 .

It 's amazing ... how many people watching this do n't GET it .
This movie used captured footage from Japan , including pictures of dead babies , massacred prisoners ( including one picture that has a decapitated head ! ) , and American POWs who were relentlessly tortured , maimed and killed .
The only thing about this that was remotely cheesy was the Japanese commentator 's makeup ; the accent could 've sounded a bit less Charlie Chan-ish , too .
But it 's like a free for all otherwise , this stupid notion that this film is " racist . "
WHAT is racist about it ??
We were at WAR with Japan after Pearl Harbor .
The projections of how many americans and japanese civilians would have to die if we island - hopped over YEARS to the Japanese mainland were staggering .
Any of these people remotely familiar with the rape of Nanking ?
The Bataan Death March ?
The dopes who think this movie is " racist " are absolutely ignorant of the Japan of the Emperor .
They made Islamic terrorists look almost reasonable !
I give the movie five stars for the Japan footage and for how well it put forward its positions that were based in FACT .
The vast majority of the info for this movie ( which , btw , was a War Bond fundraiser ) were TRUE .
There is no other conclusion one could draw , unless one is hopelessly ignorant , or pushing a very predictable political agenda .

No amount of wordplay or statistic juggling can ever justify the atrocities commited by the US in the bombing of civillians and children .
Atrocities were being commited all over the globe during this period , yes war is barbaric .
However nobody has the audacity or sheer inhumanity to even attempt defending such events except the blind nationalists of America .
They parrot statistics and talk of hypothetical lives saved as a result of dropping the atomic bombs .
Of course any normal person finds such self - righteous justification to be disgusting , immoral and quite pychopathic in nature .

This short was obviously intended to increase the resolve of the American public for further casualties , and perhaps buy a war bond to boot .
How strong is American resolve for war today ?
Apparently , some amping up of our resolve was necessary for WWII but I 'm very concerned for our will to fight in the MTV generation .
Vietnam obviously weakened our taste for war , to the point where Saddam Hussein was willing to take us on in Gulf War I because he truly believed the US public had no will to fight ( he was quoted saying that ) .
After the Iraqi War bogged down , as is the wont generally with complete takeover of any country larger than Grenada , it was simply stunning how quickly many in the American public wanted out ( thus proving Saddam 's instincts right , albeit he was off on the timing ) .
It appears , unlike the old days , our attention span for war is all too brief .

The more I watch of this the more I think that is was done more to prepare the public for the causalities of Operation Downfall than to sale bonds despite the fact that it was made by the Treasury .
Many have called the film racist but compared to some of Capra 's work ( especially Know Your Enemy - Japan ) it is surprisingly even handed .
It shows the planned invasion of Japan ( Operation Downfall ) is not going to be easy .
It compares the Japanese people to the English in that destroying the capital did not kill the country .
There is even a scene showing kids training to be soldiers - echoing Hitler 's use of 12 year old boys in defense of Berlin .
It even talks about the US not willing to pay what it will cost in lives to win the war .
No , the more you view this film the more it becomes obvious that this was intended to prepare the US public for the huge causality rates ( 1 million on the US side alone ) that were expected .

I 've lived in Japan for 15 years , and much of what this story says is true even today .
Of course you have to update it , but the points expressed , that Japan is not weak , and that Japan is not made of paper and fragile , and that Japan is not going to just lay down and die are all correct .
The point of the short was to show that Japan is stronger than most Americans and her allies were thinking at that time .
Is Japan not a global power economically and militarily ?
Japan has the largest military in Asia , yes , including China and Korea .
Do n't give in to the easy and tempting trap of calling old films propaganda .
Compared with the MTV / Moore / Gore stuff that calls itself documentary , these government shorts are flawless !
BTW , not a month goes by when nationalist black trucks w/ rising sun flags and loudspeakers and imperial uniformed men are n't making a day - long protest at Tokyo or Shinjuku station .
It is no coincidence that the rest of Asia feels no anger toward the U.S. and use of the atomic bomb .
It is no coinicidence that each year as Japan mourns its dead in Hiroshima and Nagasaki , that the rest of Asia does not drown out the crying with cries of anger toward Japan .
( the western press never reports that part , of course . )
If those who label this as untrue are serious they need to study history A LOT more , and that goes for whoever wrote the caption .
Study Bataan where Japanese soldiers practiced katana skills on prisoners for fun , Study Okinawa , where Japanese civilians were forced to commit suicide or face the bayonette of the Japanese military .
Study Harbin where Chinese civilians were experimented on , limbs amputated and sewn back on different people or in different places , where animal limbs were sewn on to replace their own , where humans stripped naked and hosed down w/ cold water in sub zero weather then watched as their own limbs , frozen solid , were shattered like glass when ' doctors ' struck them with hammers .
Study Nanjing , where tens of thousands were ' recruited ' to serve as prostitutes , slaves , targets , biological guinnea pigs , Study the Comfort Women of Korea , of China , of Singapore , of the Phillipines , Study how even to this day , November 2 , 2007 , the more than 10 , 000 korean slaves held in Hiroshima who were also killed along with the Japanese are not permitted to have their names listed along with Japanese dead .

Subject : StunnedandAmazed ... your narrow - mindedness is appalling ...
Actually , AlexJonesLemming is quite astute about the war .
The Japanese did indeed agree BEFORE the a - bombs were dropping to surrender ... on the condition that they could keep their emperor .
The emperor himself was their god , but still just a figurehead .
But the U.S. wanted an UNCONDITIONAL surrender ...
How much would it have cost the U.S. to agree ?
Not much ... in fact , it would have saved them 2 a - bombs and a lot of lives .
The a -bomb was indeed dropped as a means of intimidating the Soviet Union .
Truman had just come in as president , and , uninformed about Roosevelt 's ongoing funding to the development of the a - bomb , had to be quickly briefed on the project and the implications of its use .
Thus , when it came to crunch time , there were several options : demonstrate the bomb to the Japanese in America or in the jungles of Japan , warn the Japanese before using it , attack only military bases , attack civilian centers , use both bombs , use one bomb , etc .
Eventually , Truman ( the uneducated hick he was ) decided to use it .
And it did indeed intimidate the Soviet Union .
They started to work frantically on developing their own shortly afterwards .
And remember Potsdam , where Truman had just been informed of the success of Trinity ?
He was bragging to Stalin about it .
If that 's not intimidation , I do n't know what is .
Why would n't American industrialists finance Nazis ?
If they support the enemy secretly , the U.S. has more need to join the war , and the eventual effect is heavy reliance on American industry in the war effort .
But Rockefeller actually supported Nazis because of their euthanasia / sterilization of the elderly campaign .
I have n't heard about the last point , about U.S. leaders knowing about Pearl Harbor before it happened , but it sounds very likely .
The U.S. needed an excuse to break out of its isolationist shell and Pearl Harbor was the perfect excuse .
After all , wars stimulate rapid industrial growth , as well as medical growth .
Penicillin was used copiously during the war , and promoted more research and eventually nobel - prize winning discoveries and inventions related to it .
StunnedandAmazed , you illustrate your obvious lack of knowledge of historiography when you cite simply one source for all of your conservative beliefs , and demonstrate how you allow yourself to be indoctrinated by a single viewpoint .
You treat books as propaganda yourself , ironically enough .
All of the facts that AlexJonesLemming stated are compiled from various sources , National Archives , several primary sources and secondary sources , data , declassified CIA documents , etc .
In other words , a wide variety of sources .

Subject : Racism in WWII
If you look at the most brutal , inhuman aspects of WWII , I do not see anyone can help but recognize how huge a factor racism was in making it that way .
We viewed Japanese as an inferior race in which everyone wore glasses as thick as coke bottle bottoms , had buck teeth , technically inept etc. etc .
The Japanese on the other hand felt the were superior to all other races , after all they were the only people on the planet who had a living deity for a ruler .
The Japanese military actually made a conscious decision indoctrinate their troops in this way as a way after WWI .
During their military expansion between the wars they saw this as the best way to maintain the very highest level of discipline and obedience .
There was the Emperor , then their officers , then their NCOs then the enlisted men .
It was not at all unusual for an NCO to beat an enlisted man viciously for even very minor infractions .
All Non-Japanese persons were lower in the pecking order than the average Japanese soldier , so they felt perfectly justified do what ever they wanted to with them without a thought of remorse .
The same level of racial hatred existed on the eastern front in Europe as well .
There is no doubt that we backed Japan in a corner with our embargo of oil and steel .
They did not even have the resources to run a peace time economy , much less feed a massive war machine , but we were not willing to accept their occupation of China and Manchuria , and they felt like we were trying to deny the right of Asians to govern Asia .
It still amazes me though ; 62 years after the war ended how we can all look at , and study the history of that conflict and come up with so many different conclusions to the whys and wherefores of what took place and where is right and wrong ?
I have a book to recommend to any of you who would care to read it .
It ’s called Downfall : The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire by Richard B. Frank .
It ’s an analysis of the last 6 month of the Pacific war .
As for me , my opinion is that if we had not dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki there would not be much of a Japanese people left .
If the US had had to invade Japan and fight the type of battles that we fought on Peleliu , Iwo Jima and Okinawa there would have been wholesale slaughter of the Japanese people and the ones that were not killed by US weapons would have most likely fallen victim to the starvation .
I highly recommend this book to you especially AlexJonesLemming .
I have no idea where you got your facts , but I doubt any of it would hold up to scrutiny .

Subject :
Where would I begin ...
I could sincerely write a decent sized book in response to this and the often times inane comments written here , but , where to begin ?
Rather than make people cringe at posting such a long story , I 'll try to make a few points only ...
I 'll preface this by making my position clear : I have no side , I have friend in both the US and Japan and would hold myself to be one of the few who is really non-partisan in this case .
1 . This was propoganda and people have to see it for what it is .
Its also made a long time ago !
You'd think people would know this since its dated , but , from some of the comments I begin to wonder .
Every body did this kind of stuff .
The British made some equally bad stuff about Germans , and vice versa , in both WW 's.
[ see also point 3 ]
2. World perceptions of Japan .
Nowadays we see Japan as a big economy .
According to usual measures it was the second largest until Europe started calling itself a single economy and took 1st place from the US .
Back then , despite all that had happened , most people including governments perceived Japan as no more threat than say Thailand or Fiji .
I believe this was a very big problem for the American government of the day ... hence this particular film .
We often like to " bag " american governments for their failure to perceive or learn from history but , for once , they got it right , in that sense .
Its interesting to note that earlier in 1904 another then " self proclimed " world leader made the same mistake .
I 'm not going to say who [ see point 4 ] but , they thought they 'd boost citizen morale by kicking ass on this " little pretender " only to get their own kicked instead .
Suffice to say that within less than two decades those leaders were all gone and mostly executed [ that might give it away ] .
3 . The ultimate question about the nature of war .
This is the real question in fact and it is probably the explanation as to why most comments and indeed reviewers themselves appear polarized .
Lets look at history again .
Not that much earlier , in historical terms , European wars were fought to rules .
I mean can you believe all these people lining up to fight as if it was a game , all waiting for the agreed time to start !
At some point war took a change and peple realized that to lose meant more than just losing a fight .
WWI introduced the masses to some appalling modern war things , not the least because it was so much in the new media .
Anyway , to get to the point before I make this a min-essay ... is anything justified in war since losing can mean losing more than just a bit of territory ?
If not , where DO we draw the line ?
AS I said before , I beleive this is what polarizes opinions and people .
4 . For goodness sake people , if you dont have any hitorical knowledge , do some reading before posting knee - jerk reactions !
It would also help to think first too ! :)
There are so many ridiculous comments here I would need pages to address them all .
5 . Okay I 'll try to stop with this one .
One of the worst errors on both sides is the conclusion that the acts of goverments , whoevers , reflects the acts , ideas , thoughts ... etc of the people .
With all the acces we have to knowledge nowadays which people then did not , you would think we would know better than to still believe that nonsense .
For example , and this is just an example I 'm not taking sides as it applies equally to all , the remarks about the Japanese PEOPLE are inane .
Back then they had very little say in what was done for both reasons of law [ fear of arrest ] and perception [ brainwashing by propoganda and limited access to knowledge ] .
Even today , the government there continues to edit history so most ordinary people dont even know a fraction of what we know about the historical events .
Again I could do another essay on that one but I wont .
I better stop here or I 'm gonna need a blog for this subject , haha !

These are what caught my attention .
I 'm not even going to touch on who did what then or now .
My interests are purely in the how and why of media and propaganda .
This piece is very atypical for the time , both in propaganda method and a little bit in its production .
I highly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in American propaganda .
As a media studies student , I think this video was fascinating .
It was a very broad departure from typical American WWII propaganda methods .
I wonder how well it worked for the war bond effort ?
A few things I would like to point out : 1 . This was a great example ofgyellow - face.h
Just as it was used in minstrelsy and blackface , a common tactic of Hollywood in the 40s and 50fs was to use white actors painted up and trained togsound Asian .
This was done for many reasons , sometimes it was because many studios / crews / actors refused to work with minorities , or sometimes they were worried about the audience reaction .
My question is , since this was claimed to begcaptured Japanese footageh and a realgview of what they think , h why did n't they use an actual Asian actor ?
There had to have been an Asian in America who disliked the Japanese and was willing to do it .
It would have added a much deeper level of authenticity to drive the point home .
Any thoughts on what their motivation to use a Caucasian actor might have been ?
2 .
This is a departure from the common propaganda tactic of the time , including strategies still used today by the US and other countries .
Usually the method isglook at these inhuman monsters , they savage and mindless .h
This reel takes a very different strategy .
It 's more of a taunt than anything .
To me it sounds likeglook how capable and ready we Japanese are .
Just try and fight us.h I personally think they used this strategy because the goal was to sell war bonds and not recruit fighters .
They needed to make the Japanese look perfectly capable to establish that we were not being thegpolice of the world , h but that the Japanese were fighting to win , and thus the public needs to buy war bonds to counter .
Anyone else have any ideas about why they took this route ?
3 .
On the subject of making Japan look perfectly capable , they also made the country itself look perfectly functional and civilized ( at least domestically . )
Especially in anti-German propaganda , the imagery usually made the enemy country look like an establishing shot of George Orwellfs 1984 .
Japan was under an authoritarian government at the time , but they didnft really depict the nation as internally very bad , or at least not as bad as the Germans .
Why do you suppose that is ?

This is history , like it or not , not some KKK recruiting film .
Let us not forget who created this film , along with many more during WWII - yes its those bleeding heart liberals in HOLLYWOOD .
The same ones that McCarthy went after in the 50's , and who many liberals hold up as icons of public morality even to this day .
I think its time to WAKE UP people .

Subject : Hardly Racist
I thought this was a very interesting film .
It takes a huge departure from the typical anti-Japanese propaganda , depicting the " Japs " or " Nips " as buck toothed and spectacle clad .
The narrator instantly dismisses this notion .
In fact , I have trouble seeing how this is called racist at all .
Keep in mind a couple of things .
First , the government 's motivation to appeal to the public so was a genuine fear and appal of the Japanese government and citizenry .
This is all after a 10 + year pattern of terrible attrocities , conquest , and horrifying POW treatment .
While the film can certainly not speak for every man , woman , and child that lived in Japan , its implication that / all / citizens work so hard and hate Americans so much is hyperbole , not racism .
Many object to the choice of narrator .
Remember that cinema at this early point did n't care so much for accurate casting .
It was n't uncommon for Italians to play Arabs and put on similarly cheesey accents .
The context and message make it clear that this is a scripted event .
The choice was considered " close enough " at the time , and demonstrates historical trends , not racial bigotry .
The film also makes no presumption or statement upon the attitudes , feelings , or actions of those of Japanese descent living in America .
That said , I thought this was an interesting film .
Some points were obviously exagerated for influence , and I wonder how they must have seemed to a contemporary viewer .
There are a few disturbing frames , such as execution shots and decapitated heads .
The line about Japanese waiting for hours in line to buy war bonds came off as a bit heavy handed .
Finally , I must address the review that stated that though the Japanese government commanded cruelty and genocide , the true crime is for us to submit to a hasty generalization of the Japanese .
I 'm forced to disagree ; the true crime is genocide .
I hope this was fecetious .

Subject : Chilling
It 's strange - you 'd expect from the introduction , with the obvious caucasian man made up to look Japanese , that this will be an utter rascist crapfest , along the lines of " Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips " .
But his first lines are to laugh at the prominent American stereotype of the time depicting the Japanese as buck - toothed , glasses sporting sub-humans .
What we get instead is a look at people who are quite human - and an enemy that was more than willing to throw away their lives in the belief of divinity of their imperial government .
Instead , this film attempts to gear the populace up for the reality of a Japanese land invasion .
The only staged piece of film is the introduction - the rest is actual footage from WWII , being narrated with a rather bad Japanese accent .
Much of what you see here is actually true , sadly .
The atrocities in Japanese POW camps are well documented .
The extreme , terrifying loyalty they felt to their government as it moved forward in it 's conquest is also sadly true ( just ask the Chinese or the Koreans ) .
As this was filmed before the infamous Hiroshima and Nagasaki incidents , the reality at the time that many Americans faced was a bloody war on the Japanese mainland .
The narrator rightfully points out that the soldiers could hide anywhere and attack at any time - as soldiers making landfall on occupied territories in the Pacific learned .
The only part that made me laugh from cheesiness was the perky fanfare playing encouraging you to buy war bonds after the film has been scaring you to death .
People watching this with closed eyes , or even using it as an excuse for their own prejudices are sadly ignorant of the truths this film portrays of some of the most uncertain hours of WWII .
While we are now allies with Japan , back then they were a feared enemy .
Pick up a history book and you 'll find the same sentiments echoed , only without the goofy narration to convince today 's viewers that it was an exaggerated propaganda piece .
Imperial Japan was a fearsome force during WWII , and today even the Japanese have openly denounced their government at the time ( though sadly they have yet to apologize for their actions in Asia . )
The film tells you " This is what ALL Japanese think . "
An exaggeration , yes .
But so iron - handed was their Imperial government that it did n't matter what it 's people thought - even their own religion was part of the state .
To them , it was n't the emperor , but the kami making the decrees ( part of the reason why so many Japanese are now atheists ) .
Yes , the US has comitted atrocities in wars .
That does not mean other countries get a free pass in history because they give us anime and pocky .

It actually does debunk the sillier , outdated notions of Japan , that no doubt still existed in many people 's minds and show the militaristic mindset that did by an large exist in imperial Japanese government .
This film was clearly intended to drum up confidence for what was then thought to be an almost certain bloody battle on mainland Japan .
There 's no hint of the Manhattan Project here , folks .
And who knows how bloody and totally destructive such an invasion would have been , on both sides .
Thankfully , we never had to find out .
I find it amusing ( and a source of consternation ) that so many people here find the horrible , realistic war images shown here racist and too violent or whatever , yet they also decry it whenever propaganda films pretty up war into a big patriotic jingoistic happy fun time of glory .
And these terrible images may well have played out in the case that the invasion had gone forward .
And the film is almost prophetic in its vision of asymmetric and guerilla warfare ( " ... to dig millions of us out of caves , gullies , buildings , mountains " ) that played out in Vietnam , Afghanistan and Iraq in the decades that followed .
Folks , just lower the gain on your hypersensitivity meters for a little bit when you watch it .
Racist ?
Sure , it 's a war film .

This film was cleverly made where we are led to view WWII through the eyes of the Japanese ( no pun intended ) .
We see just how powerfull their army really is and how their people are willing to give many more sacrifices and go to much more extremes to win this war .
We Americans are left to feel as if whatever we are currently doing to win this war ( planting victory gardens , conserving gas , etc.. ) is not enough .
That is percisely the point of the film and we see a war bonds announcement at the end encouraging Americans to donate even more .
It should be noted that this film is extremely graphic in parts and dismembered bodies are pointedly shown .
Toward the end of the film our Japanese narrator announces " By all means come visit Japan , if you dare , after all it is beautifull here .

Anyway , after the A bombs were dropped , ( which could have probably been avoided but nevertheless beats the hell out of a land invasion in terms of casualties on both sides ) Japan , with US help , mended its ways to become one of the most successful countries of the modern era .

not even a " fair play to you tom , you did well " or anything , its " sweet im the best i kick all ur asses " complete and utter son of a mother of a daughter of a unvcle of a mother of a son of a beech .
" Well , I say no GOOK comes even close to the strongest or even the weakest American for that matter " yeah the strongest american m
Before the demonstration I returned to the 1955 recording , which I had not heard for several years .
I was swept away again .
This is not spiritual playing , plumbing the profundity of Bach ’s meditations ; it is ecstatic , uncanny in its intoxication .
The recording is skittish , illuminating , thrilling and extraordinarily physical : the playing seeps into muscles as well as ears ; every phrase exerts the pressure and play of dance .

John Q. Walker , Zenph ’s president , knows this as well .
He is a brilliant software engineer ( who did important work in computer networking ) and a musician who speaks of his enterprise with impassioned fervor .
Last week , when he started the Yamaha instrument playing his encodings of Gould , something thrilling really did take place .
The piano produced sounds that were indisputably human and unmistakably Gouldian .
The playing could not have come from any other pianist .
But wait .
...
Gould ’s recorded piano sound is dry , as if each note were squeezed free of moisture .
The phrases quiver ; connections between notes are tensile , as if they were being held together by sinews .
But at the demonstration the sound was often plump , rotund , even bell - like .
That is partly the character of Yamaha pianos .
And is n’t that a problem ?
Any great pianist will adjust a performance to the instrument , treating one with a “ wet sound ” differently from one with more sharply etched qualities , phrasing differently , even adjusting tempo .
This difference in instruments limits Zenph ’s claims ; it also seemed to slacken the music ’s sinews .
Presumably though the recording — done on another Yamaha that the piano technician , Marc Wienert , voiced to resemble Gould ’s old Steinway — would have a better effect .
Yet it leaves a similar impression .
Is this some psychoacoustic phenomenon then , some disorientation caused by close familiarity with the old mono sound ?
When recordings were first becoming widely available at the turn of the 20th century , there were demonstrations in concert halls in which singers would begin a song , and a hidden gramophone with its amplifying horn would complete it .
One London newspaper reported : “ The most sensitive ear could not detect the slightest difference between the tone of the singer and the tone of the mechanical device . ”
Bizarre .
But am I experiencing something in reverse , treating sonic antiquity with reverence and not recognizing musical similarities ?
We all learn languages of listening , ways of interpreting reproductions , imagining full - size orchestras emerging from clock radios , ignoring hisses or distortions , compensating for flaws .
Does the new instrumentation seem less convincing because it disrupts the old familiar language of listening ?
I do n’t think so .
In Zenph ’s recording , the music ’s tensile line really is loosened .
I admire what I hear and might not even realize what was missing without comparing , but I am not intoxicated with Gould ’s exuberance or infected with his ecstatic amazement .
The music is the same , yet not the same .
It was only 9:15 in the morning and Neal was ready to write the day off as a complete loss .
Neal 's day started off with him accidentally pressing the " Alarm Off " button instead of " Snooze , " missing his morning workout , driving downtown through the tail - end of a traffic jam , and arriving forty - five minutes late to work .
But when he stepped in the office , it was oddly vacant :
Was it a company holiday ?
Did he miss the field trip memo ?
Was today actually a Saturday ?
" Neal , " the president shouted from his corner office , interrupting Neal 's workless fantasy , " get in here ; come see this ! "
The president could get a bit emotional at times , and Neal had no idea why he was this time , but whatever the reason , it was important .
Every employee -- all nine of them -- were huddled in his little office , awkwardly watching him as he yelled out swear words , grunted random advertising terms , and scowled in disappointment .
It was a somewhat familiar sight , watching the president like that .
He was steaming furious and on the verge of taking his keyboard , chomping off the spacebar , breaking the whole thing across his knee , and then smashing his head through his monitor , parading it around as he stomped out of his office .
Neal dared to ask what was wrong .
" It 's f--- ing Google ! " he screamed , " they 're f--- ing trying to put me out of f--- ing business .
They 're screwing me , you 're screwing me , everyone is f--- ing screwing me ! "
Stunned by his words and the fury in his voice , Neal paused a moment before a eye roll with a wry smile and then asked again .
The president scowled at him , but went on to explain .
Everything started with his first search of the day : " war banners . "
The news reported that the White House edited out some war banners from its videos and he was curious to learn more about the story .
But Google would have none of that : it completely ignored his query .
It 's not that it returned " zero results , " it 's that it returned nothing .
No matter how many times he clicked the button , it just sat on Google 's home page .
Every other search worked just fine .
The president 's first culprit was the White House , who he figured was trying to cover up the story by censoring the Internet .
But then he quickly figured out who really was to blame : Google itself .
Anytime he had the word " banner " in a search result , Google would not respond to his clicks .
Typing in " bnner " worked : Google suggested " banner " and then would not do anything when he clicked on the suggestion .
It was obvious what as was going on .
Google wanted to put him and all other banner advertising companies like him out of business .
If people could n't search for or find any banner advertising services , then they 'd use Google 's advertising .
He and his employees spent the last thirty minutes discovering a whole list of banned words : " ad , " " media , " " advertisement , " " advert , " etc .
It was official : he'd be ruined .
He 'd uncovered a great Google banner ad conspiracy to allow them to control advertising revenue and put all the little guys out of business .
Sure , he could sue , but Google 's team of overpriced lawyers would crush him .
His only hope was that Google would quit because of the bad publicity .
But why should they ?
Why would they ?
They could just ban those words , too !
Neal was a bit skeptical ( to say the least ) and asked to see it in person .
" B - A - N - N - E - R , " the president said , speaking aloud every letter as he typed it , " Search .
LOOK !
Nothing !
F---ing nothing ! "
Neal let out a sigh and told the president to click the search button again , but to watch the address bar this time .
It flashed which , in Opera , indicates that the URL is considered " blocked content . "
The president had entered his own filters to block all URLs that contain the string " ads " , " advert " , " banner " , " media " , and so on .
Since those words become a part of the URL when you search for them , Opera refused to load the pages .
In addition to being completely embarrassing , it was a bit ironic .
The president of this banner advertising firm spent the entire morning making a complete fool of himself because , like the rest of us , he did n't like viewing banner ads .

昨日公開した記 事 「 IEに0 - dayのバッファ・オーバーフロー？」に対して、ある知人から次のような質問をされました。「スタック・オーバーフローが任意コードの実行に結びつく可能性があるとの事だが、それは一体どのような状況なのか？」といった内容です。同様の疑問を持った読者がいるかもしれません。そこで、この場を借りてお答えしたいと思います。
「 絶対ない」とは書かなかった理由
前回の記事で書いたように、スタック・オーバーフローで任意コードの実行が可能になる状況は非常に限定されています。というよりも、通常はあり得ません。単に無限再帰がスタックを消費し尽くすだけであり、バッファ・オーバーフローのように、リターン・アドレス（関数からの戻り先アドレス）などの特定アドレスを書き換えられるわけではありません。
ただし、 「任意コード実行が可能となる状況は絶対にあり得ないのか？」と言えばそうとも言い切れません。前回の記事を書いているとき、任意コード実行の危険性は絶対に無いと言い切ってよいかどうか考えてみましたが、無理やり考えると無くは無さそうなので「理論的には、非常に限定された条件なら可能となる場合もありますが……」としました。
そこで今回は、スタック・オーバーフローで任意コードの実行が可能となる、特殊な状況（脆弱性）についてお話したいと思います。また、そのような状況はどの程度発生しやすいのかについても考えてみます。
任意コードの実行が可能となる例
スタックには、通常、リターン・アドレスと、関数内で確保されたローカル・バッファ（ローカル変数エリア）が格納されます。再帰無限呼び出しが発生すると、関数からの戻りアドレスとローカル・バッファを格納するためのメモリー・エリアがスタックに確保され続け、最終的にはスタックが足らなくなり、スタック・オーバーフロー例外が発生します。ここまでの過程では、DoS攻撃に至る事はあっても攻撃者が用意したコードを実行される事はありません。
再帰呼び出しが発生する前に例外ハンドラが定義されていた場合、スタック・オーバーフロー例外が発生すると、その例外ハンドラに処理が移行します。この例外ハンドラの中で、もしスタック・フレーム中に記述されている特定の4バイト値を参照し、その値を関数のエントリ・アドレスとして解釈して呼び出すようなコードが記述されていると、場合によっては任意コードの実行が可能となります。
具体的には、以下のすべてを満たすと任意コードの実行が可能となります。
スタック・フレーム中のあるアドレスに、関数 e( ) のエントリ・アドレスがセットされている
ローカル・バッファに、攻撃者がセットできるデータのポインタ buf を入れる処理がある ローカル・バッファが再帰により確保およびセットされ続け、関数 e( ) のエントリ・アドレスが bufのアドレス に上書きされる 例外ハンドラがあらかじめ用意されており、その例外ハンドラの中でスタックから関数 e( ) のエントリ・アドレスを取得し、呼び出している
現実的には限りなくゼロ
しかし条件3は、よほどトリッキーな処理をしない限り発生しないバグだと思います。また、上記すべての条件を満たすコードというのは、現実的にはちょっと無さそうな気がします。他にも、任意コードが実行可能となる状況はいくつか考えられますが、いずれのバグも上記の条件に負けず劣らず特殊であり、「ついうっかり」作りこんでしまうレベルのものでは無さそうです。
という訳で、スタック・オーバーフローによる任意コード実行は、「可能となる状況もあるが、その発生率は限りなく0に近い」と思います。ですので、通常はスタック・オーバーフローで可能な攻撃は最大でDoSであり、ウイルス感染や攻撃者による不正侵入などを許す事は無いでしょう。
Media accounts and statements by officials have been full of misperceptions about the weaponization of space .

The dozen space weapons myths
The successful Chinese anti-satellite missile test two months ago , the launch on Thursday of the Pentagon ’s robot rendezvous craft that can service — or terminate — other satellites , and an impending US test of an orbiting rocket - tracking sensor package ( the controversial NFIRE mission ) have blasted “ space warfare ” back into the front of national attention .
The timing is critical , too , with changing political winds in Congress and new agendas still taking shape .
Probably the greatest impediment to productive debate over alternative national security strategies for space is the torrent of misinformation and disinformation that seethes around the subject .
Sometimes deliberately contrived , but more often innocently ignorant and enthusiastic , these myths and misconceptions can short - circuit and detour news media coverage , public debate , political maneuvering , and even international diplomacy .
Probably the greatest impediment to productive debate over alternative national security strategies for space is the torrent of misinformation and disinformation that seethes around the subject .
Some of the most alarming accusations in recent official speeches by ambassadors , delegates , and even heads of state seem to be based not on sound research , technical intelligence agency analyses , or even direct face - to - face inquiries , but on unwarranted reliance on the most inflammatory and off - base news media reports .
It ’s “ diplomacy by headline ” , and it ’s frighteningly off course .
The consequences of such carelessness could be even more serious miscalculations .
As an attempt at a roadmap through this space minefield , here is my own take on the ideas that need to be avoided or discarded on the trek towards a useful plan for handling the subject and for developing a workable , reality - based response to the problem .
1 . The United States already has satellite killers , why should n’t anyone else ?
It ’s not just the hard - line Russian commentators or the North Korean press that alleges that US military forces are already armed to the teeth for space warfare : the same explicit assumption often appears in the mainstream Western press as well .
Sometimes the argument even goes , “ Well , there ’s no official acknowledgement of them — that proves they exist in secret ” ( as if the absence of evidence were transformed into evidence of presence ) .
But since the 1985 air - launch satellite intercept , a project cancelled by Congress ( see “ Blunt arrows : the limited utility of ASATs ” , The Space Review , June 6 , 2005 ) , there is no evidence that a new satellite - killer technology has been developed .
Laser tests seem focused on interfering with satellite observation equipment , as well as to determine how to develop US countermeasures against other countries using lasers to interfere with US observation satellites .
Non-destructive radio spoofing seems to be the limit of the amount of force — short of setting off a nuclear weapon in space , which would be suicidal — the US is currently prepared to use against space objects .
2 . The latest United States “ space policy ” declares that it will “ deny access to space ” to those players it deems hostile , which translates to pre-emptive attack on non-US space objects and their supporting ground infrastructure .
Western news dispatches from Moscow , reporting on Russian official complaints about the policy , stated that it asserted the right “ to deny adversaries access to space for hostile purposes , ” and that it claimed the right ( some say “ tacitly ” ) for the US to deploy weapons in space .
Vitaly Davidov , deputy head of the Russian Space Agency , complained : “ They [ the US ] want to dictate to others who is allowed to go there . ”
But the actual policy document makes no such claim and displays no such intent to “ deny ” access .
The Russian anxiety , echoed on the editorial pages and in news stories around the world , is apparently based on some over - wrought page 1 stories in US newspapers , written by people too careless to actually read the original US document and subsequent official US government clarifications , or too eager to misinterpret it in the most alarmingly stark terms .
3 . The US is planning to deploy space - based weapons ( including nuclear weapons ) to attack other objects in space and on the ground .
Many of these stories deal with weapons that travel through space on their way to surface targets — as military missiles have done since about 1944 .
Stationing weapons in space for use against ground targets has long ago been recognized as far more expensive and less flexible than basing them on Earth , say , in a submarine .
Even planning a space - to - space attack can take hours or days or longer for the moving attacker and target to line up in a proper position .
This goes double for nuclear weapons : putting them into space on a permanent basis was last taken seriously in the Sunday comics in the late 1950’s .
So these accusations seem to confuse proposed projects ( usually already rejected — that ’s why the proponents go public with their ideas ) or even Hollywood science fiction for actual hardware .
4 . The embryonic US “ National Missile Defense ” ( NMD ) system will give the US an unfairly asymmetric and destabilizing military advantage by threatening low - orbit satellites .
References to the “ latent antisatellite capability ” of the embryonic US anti-missile system in Alaska are somewhat disingenuous since Russia has a deployed anti-missile system with launchers around Moscow and in Kazakhstan , with much the same capability and nobody seems to complain .
Most discussions leave the impression the Russian system simply does n’t exist .
Furthermore , range and tracking systems and warhead lifetimes restrict anti-missile systems to very low satellites , if any .
5 . Sensor tests of a proposed space - based missile interception system are first steps on the road to using such a weapon as an anti-satellite system .
Stationing weapons in space for use against ground targets has long ago been recognized as far more expensive and less flexible than basing them on Earth , say , in a submarine .
Equating a boost - phase anti-missile weapon ( based at sea , on an aircraft , or even in space ) to an anti-satellite weapon overlooks a fundamental design difference , their guidance mode .
To kill a missile during ascent , before it has a chance to deploy its warheads and decoys , relies on chasing down its most visible feature : its hot rocket plume .
Russian and US space tests have observed such rocket plumes for decades : there were tests from the Mir space station , and from at least one Space Shuttle mission , and there are ongoing tests from new satellite projects .
Their purpose is n’t just to develop a kill vehicle , but also to examine how an opponent might do so , and thus what features of one ’s own missiles might be modified to make them more survivable .
But these experiments should n’t deflect attention from one key fact : satellites do n’t have hot rocket plumes , and sensors developed to chase such plume generators ( i.e. , attacking missiles ) would n’t even see a passively orbiting satellite .
It ca n’t be a target if it ’s invisible to the weapon system under development .
6 . The Soviet Union opted out of the “ space arms race ” in 1983 by declaring — and following — a moratorium on further testing of anti-satellite weapons .
“ Moratorium ” is the wrong word , often deliberately so , because Moscow insisted it had never done anything it now had to stop .
Once it became clear that the Reagan Administration was going to respond to a decade of space - to - space combat tests of an operational Soviet “ killer - satellite ” , Soviet premier Andropov applied diplomatic and propaganda pressure ( to encourage Western political forces ) by announcing that “ the USSR would never be the first to test anti-satellite weapons ” — a cynically - phrased promise that belied the fact that they had already been the first many years earlier .
The promise was widely described in the West as a declared cessation of acknowledged space weapons testing , but Moscow insisted it was not , since it claimed that since it had never began testing , there was nothing it was doing that it was obligated to stop .
That sounds like the way space lawyers ( and space propagandists ) quibble .
7 . The Soviet “ killer satellite ” of the Cold War was big , clunky , and ineffective , so no US response was needed .
While Western advocates of not developing space weapons could not , with a straight face ( as Moscow did ) , proclaim there were no Soviet space weapons , they found a next - best - thing argument .
Sure , the weapons existed , but they did n’t work , so they were nothing to worry about .
But the widely - reported “ low reliability ” numbers were generated by often guessing about a test ’s success , and then conflating results from operational , deployed models with research missions with more advanced and experimental guidance systems ( which did fail a few times before working right , at which point tests of that variant were stopped ) .
Following the Soviet collapse , Russian military space historians were able to release documentation that demonstrated the high reliability of the operational Soviet “ killer satellite ” and thus the wish - away delusions of many Western experts .
Determining it was operational into the early 1990s was also easy : US spy satellites observed that the rail lines from the hangars to the launch pads were the first areas plowed of new - fallen snow .
8 . A “ killer satellite ” ( like the Soviet weapon ) is no more of a threat than any other kind of “ satellite killer ” .
Some experimental ASATs in the 1980s and 1990s were ground launched ( like the recent Chinese shot ) , and some ( all Soviet ) were space - to - space by an attacking craft already in orbit .
The enormous advantage of an orbital system ( even if launched only hours or days before making its attack ) is that simply by selecting a larger booster , the weapon can be sent into nearly any orbit of potential interest , at any altitude .
With proven support hardware from other space projects , a killer satellite with a lifetime in years could be quickly built for deployment in orbits close to potential targets .
These days , much smaller vehicles could be launched and then maneuvered , undetected , into such ambush orbits .
They could even use the Moon ’s gravity to surreptitiously slip into the high - altitude orbits of key US observation , communications , and navigation satellites .
9 . The Outer Space Treaty ( 1967 ) prevented the development of orbital nuclear weapons and this success is an example for new treaties to do the same for anti-satellite weapons .
This treaty is widely touted as having outlawed the placing of nuclear weapons in orbit .
The USSR went and built and tested and deployed a system to do exactly that : to place warheads in low atmosphere - skimming orbits that could approach their targets “ below the horizon ” of defense radars ( or approach them from unexpected directions ) , paving the way for a thermonuclear first strike .
The weapons were not explicitly forbidden by the treaty , so building them was not illegal , and using them in wartime would have entirely mooted the question of “ legality ” .
The treaty allowed Western specialists to convince themselves they had kept the genie in the bottle , but the Soviets had their fingers on the cork .
10 .
Without new treaties there is no legal protection for US military space assets .
An enemy really only needs to break a treaty once to gain enormous temporary military advantage , and after having done so , and exploited that advantage , who will be around to “ punish ” them ?
Proponents of an anti-weapons treaty are essentially saying that the rest of the world is dying to formally agree to leave the United States in possession of an overwhelming military advantage based on space - based assets , and to willingly submit to any future utilization of those capabilities .
If the military forces of at least half a dozen other nations are not at this time working out ways to neutralize the US space - based military advantage , they should be court - martialed for incompetence and lack of imaginative planning .
And if they are making such plans , the efforts become even more potentially effective if the US can be persuaded that they are not making such preparations .
Experience has shown that paper makes a very poor shield against potential attack , and parties that thought so have almost always been eventually faced with unpleasant and costly surprises .
11 . Rules and treaties can be helpful , even if they “ leak ” , because anyone breaking them can be identified and punished by the international community .
This rationalization of the tacit confession that treaties can be disregarded , with the claim that it does n’t really matter , ignores the one - time criticality and “ single-use - sensitivity ” of a reliable space weapons treaty .
An enemy really only needs to break it once to gain enormous temporary military advantage , and after having done so , and exploited that advantage , who will be around to “ punish ” them ?
It ’s not like a fine for littering , as some arms control advocates have analogized : it ’s like hoping some all - powerful referee will declare a “ do - over ” after Pearl Harbor .
Prime example : the Soviet Union ’s orbital nuclear weapon , built and tested and deployed while the 1967 Outer Space Treaty expressly forbade its use — and once used , it would render the legal proscription obsolete .
Yet this 1967 treaty is widely held up as a “ model ” for broader space treaties to emulate .
12 . Other nations are justified in building “ space weapons ” because the US has done so , or is about to do so .
This argument never seems to work both ways .
It always justifies any other country ’s space weapons , laying the blame on something the US has done , may do , is thinking about doing , or is merely accused of doing in the mass media .
But it never seems to justify any US hardware - development response to actual space weapons deployed by other countries , from the cannon mounted on a Soviet manned space station , to its operational killer satellites and orbital nuclear weapon launchers , to the recent Chinese anti-satellite missile test .
The US did not respond in kind to those weapons because they made no military sense — there was no mindless reflex , but instead a rational assessment of security requirements .
Those assessments usually can be made regardless of the actions of other parties , especially regarding the level of required space weapons .
Perhaps as befits a subject related to outer space , there seems no limit to the use of misinformation and disinformation in public arguments about “ space weapons ” .
One final example is from Russian complaints in recent weeks about US plans to deploy anti-missile systems in Poland and the Czech Republic .
The US says they are focused at potential Iranian missiles aimed at North America .
Russian spokesmen insist they are intended to destroy Russian missiles retaliating against the US in a nuclear exchange .
The Russian statements are so preposterous one has to wonder either at the intelligence of the speakers , or at their estimate of the lack of intelligence in their target audience ( true , the complaints have been taken seriously in much of the Western mass media ) .
The technological flaw is simple : missiles launched from the Czech Republic , say , cannot ever hope to intercept missiles launched from Russia against America , because — now , pay attention , Western mass media — Earth is round .
If you look at a flat map and use a ruler , a missile flight path from Russia to North America might indeed seem to fly directly westwards and cross Poland and the Czech Republic .
But run the path on a globe , with a string , and you can see that the true paths run to the northwest from Russia , out over Iceland .
The only destinations of long - range Russian - based rockets that cross the Czech Republic would be Brazil or Venezuela : not likely enemies .
Is it too much to expect that , fifty years after Sputnik , diplomats and journalists and policy wonks begin to get a few clues about how rockets really work , and how propagandists play to baseless fears and ignorance ?
Russian military missiles are fast - burn boosters , so there is only a two - or three - minute interval when an infrared - guided anti-missile could actually see and hope to hit its target .
The flight path is so far north of the proposed bases that to reach the missile in that interval would require a rocket able to achieve 20 to 40 G’s and a burnout velocity four times escape velocity from Earth ’s gravity : far greater power than any rocket ever built or even just imagined .
If this interval is missed , the would - be anti-missile would then be in a hopeless “ tail chase ” of the Russian missile , requiring the anti-missile to be much bigger and much faster than its target .
Nobody is building such an anti-missile , and probably nobody knows how to even start .
So by principles of rocket science , the recent Russian complaints can be exposed as fraudulent .
Is it too much to expect that , fifty years after Sputnik , diplomats and journalists and policy wonks begin to get a few clues about how rockets really work , and how propagandists play to baseless fears and ignorance ?
If we ca n’t even get verifiable facts and limits correct , there ’s no hope of developing a trustworthy set of international reality - based agreements regarding constraints on future actions in space or on Earth .

Seafood allergy sufferers may soon be able to eat prawns without the fear of an adverse reaction .
Chinese scientists have taken a promising step towards removing from prawns the proteins that cause an allergic response without resorting to genetic manipulation , reports Lisa Richards in Chemistry & Industry , the magazine of the SCI .
Li Zhenxing led the research at the Ocean University of China .
The team revealed that treating prawns with a combination of heat and irradiation significantly reduced the level of reactive proteins called allergens .
They took blood from patients with shrimp allergies , added samples of treated and untreated prawn , and measured how antibodies in the blood reacted .
They found that levels of ‘ Pen a 1 ’ , one of the major allergens , decreased 20 - fold after treatment ( Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture DOI 10.1002/jsfa.2746 ) .
Zhenxing ’s team suggests that irradiation damages the proteins , revealing hidden reactive amino acid residues .
Subsequent heating then destroys the exposed residues .
" Radiation and heat seems to be a promising method for reducing the immunoreactivity " say the researchers .
Samuel Lehrer of Tulane University in New Orleans , USA , is already working on removing allergens from prawns using genetic techniques .
But Zhenxing ’s method could be preferable for people wary of eating genetically modified foods .

He says tactics used by Shell are unfair to operators 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
It has become almost a regular stop for San Francisco tourists .
Once they 've seen the Golden Gate Bridge and the Transamerica Pyramid , they can drive down Harrison Street to see the most amazing sight of all .
Regular gas for $ 4 a gallon .
Actually , it is higher than that .
At Bob Oyster 's Shell station at Sixth and Harrison , regular is $ 4.33 a gallon , plus is $ 4.43 , and " V - Power " is $ 4.53 .
Motorists can be seen rolling their eyes as they drive by .
Just another example of a greedy station owner , sticking his customers for all they are worth ?
Not really .
There 's a much deeper story here , and it begins with Oyster , a respected , self - made businessman who turned a single station into Oyster Petroleum , a profitable firm in Redwood City .
Oyster is nobody 's fool .
Do n't think he is n't well aware that the Chevron station across the street is selling regular for 70 cents less .
Putting the price way up over $ 4 a gallon is n't about making a profit .
It 's about making a statement to a multinational corporation .
After Shell forced him to pay higher prices for gas in San Francisco and jacked up his rent , Oyster says , he decided to fight back .
" I got fed up , " Oyster admits .
" It makes a statement , and I guess when people see that price they also see the Shell sign right next to it . "
In fact , far from making a huge profit , Oyster is going out of business .
He has operated the Shell station at Sixth and Harrison for 22 years , but he 's walking away from it at the end of the month , handing over the keys to Shell officials and expecting them to shut it down .
" I 'm getting nothing for the station , " he says .
" I just give them the keys and walk away .
They told me they were probably just going to fence it and bulldoze it anyway . "
For franchise dealers like Oyster , it is the ultimate irony .
At a time when the oil companies are posting record profits , the little guys are struggling to stay in business .
And many , like Oyster , are giving up the fight .
" The dealer can no longer be competitive , " says Dennis DeCota , executive director of the California Service Station and Automotive Repair Association .
" The companies are squeezing these guys out .
Bob 's tired of it , and a lot of us are .
It 's just wrong . "
Shell , of course , says nothing could be further from the truth .
" I can only speak for Shell , but the majority of our sites are independently owned , " says company spokeswoman Karyn Leonardi -Cattolica .
In fact , she says , the number of independents is increasing .
Maybe so , but anyone entering the business had better be prepared .
Oyster says his rent has gone up exponentially .
Fifteen years ago it was $ 1,000 a month .
Then it went to $ 6,000 , then $ 8,000 , and five years ago the company wanted $ 13,000 .
Oyster says he was able to appeal that amount , based on real estate values , and " we got it down to $ 6,000 , " but this year Shell came back with a demand of $ 13,000 again .
Leonardi-Cattolica did not get back to us Wednesday about Oyster 's station , but when asked in the past about similar rent increases , she said , " To the extent that rents went up , it was to bring them in line with the rest of the market . "
DeCota and Oyster see a more sinister motive :
If the dealers like them leave , a company like Shell can run its stations with its own employees and set its own pump prices .
" That way they really are controlling it from the well head to the gas pump , " says DeCota .
" Once the gas companies get control , you are going to pay the price . "
It is n't just the rents that put the squeeze on the independents .
Oyster has other stations in the Bay Area where he can buy gas for up to 20 cents a gallon less than what he has to pay Shell for gas in San Francisco .
" We 've said , ' Just let me buy my gas where I want to , ' " Oyster says .
" They wo n't let me do that .
I want to say , ' You guys make enough off of me .
' Why do n't you give me a little break ? '
They do n't care .
Shell would rather put us out of business . "
That 's a job that has been pretty well accomplished .
Despite a location that is just off the entrance ramp to Highway 101 , Oyster 's station is n't getting much traffic .
Part of that is the price , of course .
I stood on the curb for a full 20 minutes Wednesday afternoon before the station had a single customer .
And that was motorcyclist Ken McNary , who said he stops by only because he thinks his Yamaha needs " V - Power " gas .
But when I asked him if he'd noticed that the Chevron had much lower prices , Oyster 's station lost another customer .
" Well , I 'm going across the street from now on , " he said .
" The last time we filled up our van here it cost $ 120 . "
While the price per gallon gets all the attention , Oyster says the little secret of independent dealers is that , like movie theater operators , they make their profit on the extras -- snacks , drinks and other items .
But with the automated pumps and a small lot , he 's limited to three gas pumps and a tiny cashier kiosk .
" All I 've got is gas and cigarettes , " he says .
" And you ca n't sell that many cigarettes . "
So Oyster took matters to their logical conclusion .
If it took $ 4 gas to get people 's attention , he 'd give them $ 4 gas .
" I 'm going out with a bang , " says Oyster .
" And I do n't care if I do n't pump a gallon on the last day . "
