Deutsche Telekom 's Musicload , one of the largest online music stores in Europe , has come out strongly against DRM on account of its effects on the marketplace and its customers , according to German - language Heise Online .
Musicload said in a letter distributed last week that customers are having consistent problems with DRM , so much so that 3 out of 4 customer service calls are ultimately the result of the frustrations that come with DRM .
In a business where the major music labels expect to be paid well for their source material , the costs of supporting DRM are borne entirely by the music retailers .
If the labels ' love affair with DRM is hurting the companies trying to make a go at selling music online , something is horribly wrong .
According to Musicload , DRM " makes the use of music quite difficult and hinders the development of a mass - market for legal downloads . "
The lack of interoperability is unfair to customers and prevents true competition between music services , in other words .
Musicload itself is in heated competition in Germany with Apple 's iTunes Store .
Apple 's Steve Jobs has come out against DRM as well , although his iTunes Store does not offer DRM - free music despite the fact that many artists have requested it .
A new upstart in the online music sales business , Amie Street , has inked deals with a number of top artists to do what Apple thus far has been unwilling to do , while eMusic has seen moderate success selling DRM - free music from independent labels for quite some time now .
Musicload has also tried to differentiate itself by allowing independent music labels to sell their music on the service sans DRM , and the move has reportedly been a success .
Championing the " Comeback of MP3 , " Musicload said that artists choosing to drop DRM saw a 40 percent increase in sales since December , and that more artists and labels are showing interest .
The company hopes that DRM - free MP3s make a comeback , though there have been few signs that the major labels are interested .
EMI has been toying with the idea , but the company expects resellers like Musicload , Apple and others to carry the supposed " risk " by paying increased fees upfront .
In a harrowing first - person account , published in the latest edition of the German news magazine Der Spiegel following the release of the six last week , Dr Alhajouj described how following his initial arrest in January 1999 , along with the nurses , he was taken to a police dog training centre outside Tripoli .
" For the first days I was locked up with three dogs who were ordered to attack me .
My leg is full of scars and marks from where they bit me [ and ]
I had a big hole in my knee , " he said .
Later , he said , wire cable that had been stripped of its plastic coating , was wound round his penis and he was dragged " screaming and crying " across the floor .
He was also given electric shocks with a generator - style machine .
" They put the minus cable on my finger and the plus cable on my ear or my genitals .
The most painful thing was their ability to increase the speed of the electricity flow .
When I fell unconscious they would throw cold water over my naked body and then begin all over again , " he said .
The torture times were set for between 5 pm and 5 am and continued for 13 months .
The nurses were submitted to similar treatment .
" Sometimes we were tortured in the same room .
I saw them half - naked , they saw me completely naked when I was being electrocuted .
We heard each others ' whimpering , crying and screaming . "
He said he saw the women being raped and watched as one of them broke a piece of glass from the window and cut her wrists when she could not bear it any longer .
Dr Alhajouj , who is temporarily living in Bulgaria , denies the charges that he and the nurses infected 426 Libyan children with HIV .
He described the hygiene conditions at Bengasi hospital , where he went to work in 1998 , as " catastrophic " .
" We had no needles , the sterilisation apparatus was broken and there was only one pair of scissors to cut the umbilical cord of a dozen newborns " .
He said he planned to sue his torturers .
以前にも書いたような気がするけど、私は現役大学院生だけど、授業料、生活費、諸々は奨学金とアルバイトで払っていて、親の援助は受けていない。私の場合は大学院からこの形態だけど、兄は私立大学の学部で同じことをやっている。まぁ、ぶっちゃけ実家は貧乏なのである。
正直な話、大学にいけないのを親の収入のせいにするのはそれこそ甘えだろう。国公立大学には授業料減免制度もあるし、有利子でよければ日本学生支援機構の第二種奨学金は最大で月額10万円あるわけで、学業に支障をきたさない程度のアルバイトで修学できる。奨学金の成績基準も普通に勉強していれば問題ない程度。
別の場所 。
「 頑張らないと暮らしていけない」という言説は「暮らしていけない人は頑張っていない」という烙印を押しているに過ぎません。
それは違うだろうと思った。
あとまぁ、社会ってやつは働ける人間は働いて、個々人がより豊かなろうとする、というのが前提だと思うんだ。
そういや、日本はレール( 新卒就職)を外れた瞬間に格差が決まって元に戻れないという話もあったりするけどその辺にはだれも言及しないのかな。
追記 なんかブックマークが・・・かるく読んで思ったことを。
思い出したが、日本学生支援機構の場合、第一種奨学金と第二種奨学金を併用すれば月15万までいけたりするので、地方の国立大なら奨学金で授業料も生活費も工面できる(学生なので年金も健康保険も払わないで済む)し、さらに授業料が免除されて寮住まいとかだと経済的にはむしろ余裕があるかもしれない。まぁ、借金なんだけどね。
貧乏なのが不利なのも間違いないけど、本質的に平等にするのも無理(たとえば予備校はどうする)な話で、平等にパスが用意されていることが重要なんだと思う。あまり格差があるのも問題だけど。
あとまぁ、いささか話を単純化しすぎているので、個別のケースがみんな「甘え」なわけではないです。たとえば、「親の援助なし」だけではなく、「親を援助」しないといけないケースだって有り得て、それで進学しないのが甘えかというとそんなことはないと思う。ただ、「大学は行かしてもらう物」ではなく、自分への投資だと理解するべき。別に大学に限った話じゃないけど。
まぁ、なんかぐだぐだ書いたけど、格差というかいわゆるワーキングプアが問題なのなら、そこから抜け出すパスがきちんと用意されているか、パスに乗り損ねても別のパスに乗ることができるか、という話な気がした。
追記 # 2 勘違いする人もいるようなので一応書いておく。私は授業料減免は全額免除どころか半額免除の枠からも外れているので、授業料は全額払っている。
US officials guilty of “ sociocide ” in Iraq must be held accountable
the Editorial Board
24 May 2007
This week the World Socialist Web Site ran a three - part article , “ The US war and occupation of Iraq — the murder of a society , ” by Bill Van Auken .
The series , bringing together facts and statistics drawn from the international media and a variety of studies and surveys , painted a horrifying picture of Iraqi society after more than four years of US - led war and occupation , preceded by more than a decade of lethal sanctions .
“ Taken together , ” the article argued , “ US operations in Iraq have amounted to sociocide — the deliberate and systematic murder of an entire society . ”
Here are certain of the series ’ key findings :
— The US occupation is responsible for the death , displacement or disappearance of between 4 and 5 million Iraqis .
— Iraq has experienced a staggering and globally unprecedented increase in the rate of infant mortality .
Since 1990 , on the eve of the first Gulf war , the rate has grown by 150 percent .
In 2005 , 122,000 Iraqi children perished , half of them newborns .
— Half of Iraqi children suffer from some form of malnutrition , less than one - third attend school ( compared to 100 percent before March 2003 ) and the war has produced thousands of orphaned and homeless children .
— The status of women in Iraqi society has been driven back generations as a result of the general social retrogression and the rise to prominence of Islamic parties and armed militias .
— A report by the Minority Rights Group International now ranks Iraq as the second - worst country in the world in its treatment of minority peoples , better only than Somalia and worse than Sudan ( Darfur ) .
— Eighteen thousand of Iraq ’s 34,000 doctors have left the country .
An additional 2,000 have been murdered under the US occupation .
Forty percent of Iraq ’s “ professional class ” ( including doctors , professors , pharmacists and other university - trained personnel ) , have left the country since 2003 .
Iraq ’s educational system , once one of the best in the region , has virtually collapsed .
— The official jobless rate in Iraq is 48 percent .
The actual figure is estimated to be closer to 70 percent .
Iraq ’s inflation rate in 2006 , the second highest in the world , soared to 50 percent .
Fifty - four percent of the population is surviving on less than US $ 1 a day , 15 percent on less than 50 cents a day .
The country ’s GDP has been more than halved in the past two decades .
In sum , the encounter of America with Iraq has been catastrophic for Iraq ’s population , and the situation grows worse on a daily basis .
In official US circles , there is less and less talk about Iraq ’s “ fledgling democracy , ” which was never more than a smokescreen , and a good deal more cynical discussion about how America ’s interests in the country , i.e. , its vast oil reserves , can still be “ secured . ”
Having raped and pillaged the country , the cabal in Washington is still calculating how to carry out its plunder .
Every major institution in American life is complicit in the Iraq war .
Upon reading “ The US war and occupation of Iraq — the murder of a society , ” one of the first things that comes to mind is that this generalized portrait of Iraqi life is never presented in the US mainstream media .
The New York Times and the Washington Post have vast resources , considerably greater than those of the World Socialist Web Site , but they have not troubled themselves to investigate in a systematic manner or comment upon the tragedy inflicted on the Iraqi people .
Nor has the Los Angeles Times or the Boston Globe , or CNN , or ABC News or CBS News , or any other major news outlet .
All these organizations transmitted , without criticism , the lies of the Bush administration about “ weapons of mass destruction ” and Iraq ’s “ ties to terrorism ” and share responsibility for the present situation .
Their silence implies both indifference and a guilty conscience .
The present horror in Iraq has profound implications not only for that ravaged nation , but for American society as well .
Whatever tactical differences exist between Bush and his Democratic opponents , the entire ruling elite is agreed that America must “ succeed ” in the region .
By “ success ” is meant taking whatever ruthless measures are necessary to guarantee US domination of Middle East energy supplies .
The barbarism of the Iraq occupation casts a dark shadow over American life .
The social , political , cultural and psychological health of the US population is also at stake in this war .
Despite the blackout of the Iraq reality in the major media , a growing section of the American people feels shame and anger over what has been done in its name .
At present this finds no possible expression in the public arena .
The lack of mass protest does not , however , betoken satisfaction or acquiescence .
With both major parties , the media , the trade unions , indeed every official social organism , firmly and conspicuously “ part of the problem ” in America , to whom should protests be directed ?
This simply means that the inevitable social explosion will occur outside official channels .
It is absolutely critical that those responsible for the vast crimes in Iraq be held accountable .
George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Colin Powell , Donald Rumsfeld , Condoleezza Rice , Robert Gates , leading Democrats , the top generals and media conglomerate moguls are guilty of preparing , encouraging or carrying out war crimes .
Crimes of this magnitude cannot go unpunished without the most devastating social and moral consequences .
As we have explained before , this is not a matter of vengeance , but the political education of the population as a whole .
The process by which these bloody crimes against foreign peoples are set in motion , as well as their true geopolitical driving forces , needs to be exposed in full view of masses of people .
Only when the population understands the character of such wars , sees through the lies of the establishment and takes political matters into its own hands will the mad war drive of American imperialism be halted .

In a speech to the Association of American Publishers today , Microsoft associate general counsel Thomas Rubin launched a harsh attack on his company 's chief rival , Google .
At the core of his criticism is the assertion that Google is no friend to copyright holders .
" Companies that create no content of their own , and make money solely on the back of other people 's content , are raking in billions through advertising revenue and IPOs , " said Rubin .
" Google takes the position that everything may be freely copied unless the copyright owner notifies Google and tells it to stop . "
Harsh words , but accurate to a degree .
Google 's book search project uses an opt - out model , requiring copyright owners to inform Google that they do not want their books indexed .
In contrast , Microsoft is part of the Open Content Alliance , a book - indexing project also backed by Yahoo , HP , and the Internet Archive .
Unlike Google Print , the OCA is only digitizing books that are currently in the public domain .
Books still under copyright protection will only be scanned if the publisher opts in to the program .
Google 's Book Search program has been a sore point with publishers .
The search giant was sued by The Authors Guild in 2005 , which accused Google of " massive copyright infringement . "
Google has dismissed The Authors Guild 's claims that Google Book Search is a " plain and brazen violation of copyright law , " saying that the project fully complies with copyright law and that it is consistent with the principles of Fair Use .
Given Rubin 's audience , Microsoft 's broadside on Google is no surprise .
The Association of American Publishers has been critical of Google 's efforts and is no doubt receptive to Rubin 's arguments : " Google has chosen the wrong path for the longer term , " says Rubin , " because it systematically violates copyright and deprives authors and publishers of an important avenue for monetizing their works . "
Moving beyond Book Search , Rubin brings up Google 's AdWords and AdSense programs .
Last month , we reported on the discovery that some of Google 's AdSense customers were aiding piracy web site by directing traffic to them and selling advertising for them .
Noting that Google reportedly earned $ 800,000 in advertising revenues from four of those sites , Rubin says that the incidents " are not the actions of a company that has the interests of copyright owners as one of its priorities . "
In contrast , Rubin paints Microsoft as a friend of copyright holders .
" Microsoft and most other companies , by contrast , take the position that they should get the copyright owner 's consent before they copy , " Rubin explained .
" The Copyright Act , in our view , supports this approach .
It 's hard to see any justification for exempting Google from its requirements . "
Microsoft and Google have definitely chosen different paths when it comes to copyright .
Google 's approach could be described as " index first , ask later . "
In contrast , Microsoft has been very willing to accommodate the concerns of copyright holders — witness the efforts to which Microsoft has gone to appease rights - holders with its new Soapbox video site — but the company does so to the point that it limits the usability of their products or makes them less useful to its users ( e.g. , the Zune 's crippled WiFi functionality ) .
It 's a great strategy if you 're primarily interested in building strategic partnerships with major industry players , but consumers arguably prefer Google 's approach .
Leahy :
Is Bush directly responsible for firing US Attorneys ?
Michael Roston
Published : Thursday August 2 , 2007
Print This Email This The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee started a hearing on the firing of eight federal prosecutors by asking if President George W. Bush was directly responsible for the termination of the prosecutors .
" We are quickly reaching the point where , given the claim of executive privilege , the logical question is what did the President know and when did he know it ? " asked Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) in his opening remarks .
" By his claim of executive privilege , is President Bush now taking responsibility for the firing of such well - regarded and well - performing U.S. attorneys ? "
Leahy also pointed to Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald 's statement that a cloud was hanging over Vice President Dick Cheney during the trial of his former aide I. Lewis ' Scooter ' Libby , and compared it to the current situation .
" Federal prosecutors observed that such a cloud hangs over the Vice President in the Libby case , " he added .
" A similar cloud now envelopes Mr. Rove and his partisan political team at the White House , as well . "
Top Bush adviser Karl Rove was absent at the hearing , claiming that the President 's assertion of executive privilege covered all statements that he might make under subpoena .
However , an aide to Rove , J. Scott Jennings , was permitted to attend the hearing and testify on a limited basis .
Jennings serves as Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Political Affairs .
Leahy went on to knock the President 's theory of executive privilege .
" How can communications with the Justice Department , the RNC and others outside the White House be subject to any claim of ' executive privilege ? ' " he asked , further pointing out that Rove had spoken in public about the US Attorneys firings on several occasions .
Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) next criticized the Attorney General for his clarification of his testimony last week on the government 's counterterrorism - related spying program .
" He is playing a cat and mouse game with Congressional oversight , " the Ranking Republican on the committee said .
But he went on to suggest that Congress should make an effort to stay out of court .
He proposed sitting down with Rep. John Conyers and President Bush to come to a compromise .
" We can work it out , we have had disagreements where we have sat down with the President and worked it out , " Specter said .
" I think we need to finish this investigation and find a way to end the tenure of Attorney General Gonzales so we are not distracted by these issues . "
Senator Leahy 's response to Specter 's proposal seemed less than positive .
" Let 's you and me talk about this afterward , " he said to Specter , adding that he was dubious of cooperation because of " this total lack of cooperation , this stonewalling . "
Jennings notes spam , ' hate mail ' after RNC e-mail outed Scott Jennings gave a brief opening statement in which he noted that he would not answer any questions relating to the firing of the federal prosecutors .
Senator Leahy started his questioning on Jennings ' use of a ' gwb43.com ' e-mail account supplied by the Republican National Committee .
Jennings at first noted that he had stopped using that particular e-mail address because it had been filled with spam and ' hate mail ' after it first emerged in documents turned over to Congressional investigators .
Ironically , the Vermont Democrat had just asked the White House aide if he was still using an RNC e-mail account .
Jennings confirmed he was , and then said the new address out loud .
Leahy then asked Jennings when he chose to use the RNC e-mail account in place of his White House account .
" I must respectfully decline to answer your question at this time , " he responded .
The phrase was repeated often in Jennings ' exchange with Leahy regarding such matters as whether or not he had spoken with the President since 2004 on the firing of the prosecutors .
" It sounds like the American taxpayers are paying you to stonewall , " Leahy said at the end of his time .
However , on the use of the e-mails , Jennings conferred with his attorney and answered Leahy 's question about the use of the RNC e-mail account .
He stated that he preferred the RNC account because he had ' 24 - 7 access ' to it , in contrast with his White House e-mail account which he could only use in the White House .
The answer seemed to vary with that of Sara Taylor , his former boss , who testified earlier before the committee , and said that she simply used the RNC e-mail account out of ' efficiency . '
' I am a current employee , ' Jennings insists Senator Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) followed on with the inconsistency between his responses and Taylor's .
Taylor , Durbin noted , had answered queries on whether or not she had spoken with the President about the US Attorneys firings .
In contrast , Jennings had refused to answer Leahy 's yes or no questions despite the senator 's protestations that he was not seeking the content of any communications with the President .
The current White House adviser argued there was a difference between Jennings and Taylor 's place because she testified after quitting her post .
" Sara is a former employee , " he said .
" I am a current employee and I simply do not intend to disobey a directive from the President . "
Kennedy asks Jennings about Hatch Act violations Senator Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) then turned the discussion to another subject : whether or not presentations given by Jennings and other White House officials to political appointees at federal agencies violated the Hatch Act .
The Hatch Act outlaws the use of federal employees for politicking and electioneering .
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has investigated the conduct of such briefings , one of which was carried out at the General Services Administration and delivered by Jennings .
Administrator Lurita Doan appeared to ask during one such briefing how GSA could help Republican political candidates .
Jennings admitted to conducting ' roughly ten ' such briefings .
The White House aide insisted that the briefings was that had a primarily ' morale boosting ' function and that they were ' informative . '
He did not believe that they violated the Hatch Act .
" It is my understanding that this kind of briefing has been occurring for several years and over the course many administrations and that many people had decided that it does not violate the Hatch Act , " he told Senator Kennedy .
But when Kennedy pointed to Doan 's reported remarks , Jennings refused to answer , saying that Bush 's decision on the results of an Office of Special Counsel investigation should be deferred to .
" I 'm not sure it would be appropriate for me to comment on a pending presidential decision , " he said .
He also claimed he " did not recall " Doan making the remark .
However , he did admit that at these briefings he discussed , " specific candidates ... in the context of forecasting the political landscape in the forthcoming cycle . "
Kennedy was dubious .
" What real purpose other than overt political activity could these briefings have served ? " he asked .
Jennings only repeated his insistence that the briefings were ' morale - boosters . "
Aide consults lawyers frequently on NM meetings
In an exchange with Senator Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) on meetings he had with a pair of New Mexico Republican attorneys , Jennings consulted his attorneys frequently .
In addition to his personal attorney , Emmet Flood , an attorney from the White House Counsel 's office , also advised the witness on his responses .
Jennings confirmed that he had breakfast with Pat Rogers and Mickey Barnett , two Republican attorneys who had actively sought the removal of David Iglesias , the former US Attorney for New Mexico .
Jennings , who worked on the President 's 2004 campaign in New Mexico insisted that the meeting was social , and that Iglesias ' performance did not come up .
" It was a social breakfast , I do n't remember any conversations about business in general , " he claimed .
But when Schumer then asked why Jennings had arranged a meeting between Rogers , Barnett , and former Justice Department White House Liaison Monica Goodling , Jennings refused to answer , pointing to the President 's assertion of executive privilege .
" Can you explain or your counsel explain to me why all these other questions are not privileged , and this one is ? "
Schumer asked .
" You ca n't just answer the ones you want to answer and not answer the ones you do n't want to answer . "
His counsel responded that the meeting had nothing to do with the US Attorneys .
Schumer was suspicious of the response .
" Why after a purely social meeting would there then be a memo sent to Monica Goodling on a sensitive matter asking her to see Mr. Barnett , " he probed .
As Schumer pressed , Jennings asked for leeway .
" Senator , I 'm doing the best that I can , and believe me , this is likely as frustrating for me as it is for you , " the White House aide responded .
The remark produced an agitated response from Chairman Leahy .
" No , trust me , it is not , " he quipped to laughter in the room .
Schumer then closed his questioning , doubting that executive privilege was at issue .
" It seems to me it depends on the difficulty on the question , not the amount of privilege , " he concluded .
Cannibal Holocaust / Holocosto Cannibal ( 1979/1984 ) *****
I tend to view most movies of the kind that I end up writing reviews of with a sort of wry humor , and I try to convey some sense of that attitude when I sit down to write about them .
That said , I want to advise you not to look for any of that in this review , or in the film it discusses .
Cannibal Holocaust is absolutely not , under any circumstances , a fun movie .
It is beyond disturbing , a movie to be watched alone with the sort of sober attentiveness due a rattlesnake or a Moroccan fat - tailed scorpion .
I have seen a fair number of Italian cannibal movies in my time -- Make Them Die Slowly , Cannibal Apocalypse , The Mountain of the Cannibal God , Dr. Butcher , M.D. -- plus a few quasi-cannibal flicks like White Slave and The Grim Reaper , but I seriously can’t recall ever having seen a film so uncompromisingly vicious , so unflinching in the face of its own hideousness in my entire B - movie - watching life .
And believe me , coming from me , that is saying something .
This movie is divided fairly neatly into two sections , and today , its story is likely to remind people of a certain low - budget independent horror film that recently caused quite a stir because of the synergistic interaction of its mock - cinema verite approach and the unparalleled marketing savvy of its creators .
Cannibal Holocaust begins with a TV news anchorman talking about a team of highly respected freelance telejournalists , led by director Alan Yates ( Gabriel Yorke ) , who went to the Amazon basin to film a documentary about the local stone - age tribesmen and never came back .
At the time of the news broadcast , the filmmakers have been missing for several months , and a distinguished anthropologist named Harold Monroe ( cannibal movie regular Robert Kerman , who would do this again in Eaten Alive and Make Them Die Slowly ) , of New York University , has decided to embark on his own expedition in search of Yates and his companions .
When Dr. Monroe arrives in South America , the local paramilitary police authorities inform him that they have captured a man from the Yakumo tribe , an inhabitant of the region of the jungle where Yates ’s team disappeared .
Significantly , because the Yakumo have never been known to practice cannibalism , when the tribesman was found , he and several of his fellows were sitting around a campfire , far from their own territory , eating the remains of a human being .
The policemen attacked the primitives , killing all but the one to whom they now introduce Dr. Monroe .
Monroe decides to take the man along as a guide , in addition to Chaco ( Salvatore Basile ) and Martinez ( Paolo Paoloni , from Inferno and Dr. Jekyll Likes Them Hot ) , the guides whom he had already hired .
This turns out to have been a wise decision , as the Yakumo prove unexpectedly hostile when Monroe and his guides finally reach them .
Like all primitive peoples , the Yakumo are potentially dangerous , living in a world where human life is among the cheaper commodities ( as the grisly execution of a young adulteress , which serves as our introduction to the Yakumo way of life , reminds us ) .
But the hostility that confronts Monroe is unusually extreme for what is generally considered to be a fairly peaceful people .
Indeed , it seems fairly likely that he , Chaco , and Martinez would have spent the trip home pulling poison darts out of their asses had they not had a hostage to trade .
Even then , the Yakumo treat the outsiders with uncharacteristic suspicion -- later on , the reason will become abundantly clear .
Nevertheless , Monroe learns from the Yakumo what he wanted to know .
Yates had in fact been to their village , and his team had then continued upstream into a part of the jungle where the Yakumo fear to venture .
The Yakumo ’s trepidation stems from the fact that that region is inhabited by two extremely fierce tribes of cannibals , the Yanomamo ( the People of the Trees ) and the Shamatari ( the People of the Swamp ) , who war constantly with each other , and are both perfectly happy to kill and eat any other strangers they come across .
That Yates and his people would venture into their land is eloquent testimony to their fearlessness and ambition .
Monroe and his guides continue following the trail until they , too , encounter the Yanomamo .
By a stroke of luck , they arrive on the scene just in time to save a Yanomamo foraging party from an attack by Shamatari raiders , driving the latter cannibals off with their rifles .
This is the first step in the difficult process by which Monroe ingratiates himself to the Yanomamo , a process that culminates in his joining them in a feast where the main course is the body of a Shamatari captive , and which pays off with the discovery in the Yanomamo ’s territory of a totem made of the bones of Yates and his crew , along with their film and equipment .
Monroe trades his tape recorder for the film ( which the Yanomamo are perfectly happy to get rid of -- they believe it to be the source of Yates ’s black magic , a revelation which should worry you at least a little bit ) , and returns to New York .
The rest of the movie , about half its running time , consists of Monroe watching Yates ’s film in the company of various employees of some big , cynical TV network .
Call it The Blair Cannibal Project , if you ’d like .
As the footage reveals with ever - increasing ghastliness , Yates and company more than earned their fate .
The first troubling hint ( after the revelation that the Yanomamo considered Yates an evil sorcerer ) comes when one of the TV people tells Monroe that Yates had a reputation for doctoring his documentaries .
He was n’t exactly a fraud , but if he decided that his subject was n’t exciting enough , he was not above steering events in a more sensational direction .
But that does n’t begin to describe his conduct in Amazonia .
Yates ’s jungle expedition was nothing less than a nihilistic rampage of terror for the sake of ratings , right from the moment when his guide , Felipe , was bitten by a poisonous snake , and Yates decided to treat the bite by amputating the man ’s leg at the knee with his bolo knife .
The Yates party ’s interaction with the natives was simply one atrocity after another .
The director had hoped to film an attack by one or the other of the cannibal tribes on the Yakumo village , but when no such massacre was forthcoming , Yates opted to improvise by rounding up as many of the Yakumo as he could , herding them into one of the larger huts , and setting it ablaze , his cameras running the entire time .
His treatment of the cannibals was no better .
His first contact with the Tree People came when he encountered a lone Yanomamo girl by the riverbank .
Again , an atrocity resulted , as he and his cameramen took turns filming each other raping the girl , even over the vociferous protests of Yates ’s own fiancee ( arguably the least evil of this degenerate crew ) .
When Yates ’s comrades begin to fall victim to the Yanomamo , their conduct only makes them seem even slimier .
Yates himself films from a hideout in the brush as the cannibals emasculate his cameraman and then hack him to pieces with stone adzes .
He does the same when his other companions are killed , even going so far as to film the gang - rape and dismemberment of his girlfriend .
By the time the cannibals get their hands on Yates , we ’re practically cheering for them .
On its face , this does n’t sound too much different from the plot of Make Them Die Slowly , and on the surface , the two movies are very similar .
But differences in tone make Cannibal Holocaust a beast of another species altogether .
Make Them Die Slowly is brainlessly exploitative .
Cannibal Holocaust is plenty exploitative , but it is a canny , manipulative exploitiveness that no other cannibal movie I know of has matched .
The mainspring of this film is the horrific blurring of the line between fantasy and reality .
To begin with , the half of the movie that is supposed to be Yates ’s footage uses a different film stock from the framing story .
This film stock is grainy , scratched , and discolored ; its frame composition is imperfect and inconsistent ; some scenes are over - exposed , some under - exposed ; the sound comes and goes erratically , and is always underlain by the rattling of the camera ’s internal machinery .
The poor quality of the picture and sound add an extra layer of believability both by mimicking what you would expect from film that had been sitting undeveloped in its canisters in the jungle for four months , and by making it harder to spot the shortcomings of the gore effects .
I ’ve heard a story about an English reviewer who watched Cannibal Holocaust over and over again the day she went to see it in an attempt to find something to assure her that what she had seen was not real .
That story may not be literally true , but it makes a great legend , conveying exactly the nature of this movie .
But there ’s more to Cannibal Holocaust ’s aura of ghoulish verisimilitude than sneaky camera tricks .
You see , this film is laden with the most monstrous cruelty to animals that I have ever seen in a movie .
I ’m not talking about stock footage of animals eating each other , either .
I ’m talking about the actors in this movie actually killing actual animals right in front of the leering camera .
A smallish snake is decapitated ; a muskrat has its throat slit ; a monkey ’s skullcap is hacked off ; and in the most loathsome sequence of all , Yates and company catch , butcher , cook , and eat an enormous turtle .
I want you to understand me here .
I ’m neither an animal rights activist nor a vegan .
I eat meat ; I wear leather ; I have taken biology and anatomy courses in which I have personally dissected earthworms , oysters , lampreys , sharks , perches , frogs , fetal pigs , rabbits , and even a cat that looked uncannily like a beloved childhood pet .
I am no stranger to the arguments both for and against taking an instrumental view of animal life , and most of the time , I incline more toward the affirmative side of that debate than the negative .
But I do recognize certain distinctions and boundaries , and the treatment of animals in this movie is hideous , unspeakable .
You may recall that in my review of Cannibal Apocalypse , I mentioned that this movie has actually been mistaken for a snuff film ( and , hey , it is if you ’re a turtle ) .
Here ’s the story , which I think is important for a complete understanding of this film .
Director Ruggero Deodato shot Cannibal Holocaust in Venezuela , a part of the world that had a reputation as a point of origin for snuff films .
Now think about this .
A gore movie of unprecedented intensity comes along , shot in the jungles of Venezuela , positively loaded with nauseating animal cruelty that seems to say , “ hey , if we were willing to do this ... ”
Looked at in those terms , it ’s scarcely surprising that , upon his return to Italy , Deodato was actually prosecuted for making this movie , while the Venezuelan authorities launched their own criminal investigation into the production of Cannibal Holocaust .
Reportedly , Deodato had to round up the extras who had played several of the featured victims in order to prove that they were still alive .
Meanwhile , in less vigilant parts of the world , the movie ’s distributors drew up lurid advertising campaigns promising that it depicted real - life events , even if the movie itself was merely a dramatization of them .
Makes the internet feeding - frenzy over The Blair Witch Project seem positively tame , does n’t it ?
Moral considerations aside , it seems inescapable to me that Cannibal Holocaust has a certain vile , monstrous genius about it .
It may not be a good movie in the commonly understood sense of the term , and it certainly plays dirty , but this is a film that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do .
I have thus given it my highest rating , albeit with a certain amount of discomfort .
I had looked for this movie literally for years , and I ’m glad I finally saw it .
But I ’d be a liar if I said I had any particular desire to see Cannibal Holocaust again any time soon , maybe even ever .
This is not a film you enjoy watching .
If you do -- if you derive pleasure from the experience , as most of us understand pleasure -- it probably would n’t be a bad idea to seek out a mental health professional of some sort .
No , really .

Charles Antony Richard Hoare is one of the most productive and prolific computer scientists .
This volume contains a selection of his published papers .
There is a need , as in a Shakespearian Chorus , to offer some apology for what the book manifestly fails to achieve .
It is not a complete ' collected works ' .
Selection between papers of this quality is not easy and , given the book 's already considerable size , some difficult decisions as to what to omit have had to be made .
Pity the editor weighing the choice between a seminal paper , perhaps widely republished , and a lesser known gem overtaken by subsequent developments .
The only defence that can be offered is to reassure the reader that Tony Hoare was consulted .
The paper published as Chapter 1 is so placed because it provides biographical context .
With this exception , the papers appear in chronological order of main publication .
Each paper is introduced by ' link material ' .
Here again , there is need ( at least ) for explanation : how can one embellish such papers ?
The idea behind the link material is to record things which could not have been written in the original paper .
Sometimes , it is possible to explain better the context in which a paper was conceived ; the subsequent development of the ideas introduced can only be written with hindsight .
Apart from these inputs , the papers speak so well for themselves that it has been possible to keep the link material brief .
Because the editor 's text varies in length , the ( abstract and ) paper follow immediately rather than being laid out on separate pages .
In order to avoid confusion , the link material is set in a smaller fount .
Again to assuage the reader 's doubts , Hoare does have the last word in the Postscript .
An attempt has been made to trace some of the key dates of drafts , submissions , etc. leading up to publication .
For a scientist who points out that ' writing the paper is my method of research ' this is both necessary and difficult .
Some of Hoare 's papers go through many drafts which are circulated to colleagues ( sometimes changing title , sometimes using the same title on a complete rewrite . )
A complete historiography has not been attempted .
In particular , many of Hoare 's papers have been reprinted ( sometimes in several places ) : normally , only the first source is given .
With some caution , Hoare 's work can be divided under a number of headings .
These themes are not disjoint , the whole output comes from a single person .
Hoare 's work on language definition is seen in Chapters 3 , 13 , 14 , 16 ( and also , to a lesser extent , in Chapters 11 , 12 ) ; his contribution to methods of reasoning about programs is covered in Chapters 4 - 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 20 ; his seminal work on parallelism can be traced through Chapters 10 , 12 , 15 - 17 .
Amidst writing these , often difficult , papers Hoare has produced a number of articles aimed at a wider audience : here , Chapters 1 , 2 , 7 , 18 , 21 , 22 represent this form of his writing .
The papers themselves have all been re-typeset and only minimal changes have been made .
The form of references to other publications has been made uniform and all references have been collected at the end of this volume .
In order to provide a useful snapshot , all papers by Hoare ( even if there are co-authors ) have been gathered into a separate list of references .
( Except where they are referred to , Technical Reports etc. are not included : only true ' publications ' are listed . )
The form of reference to these is ' [ 72 ] ' or ' Hoare ( [ 72 ] ) ' , the list being ordered , and numbers accordingly assigned , on a chronological basis .
( This results in the use of ' Hoare ' as a key even where the article lists a co-author before Hoare .
No disrespect to his erstwhile colleagues is intended . )
The other list of references gives works to which Hoare has not contributed .
It is listed alphabetically , and references take the form ' Dijksta ( 1976 ) ' , with a , b etc. to distinguish publications in the same year .
The editor and the publishers acknowledge , with thanks , permission to reprint the copyrighted articles in this book that have been published in various journals , proceedings , and books .
Individual credits , with details of the sources of the papers , are given as a footnote to each chapter opening .
The task of editing these essays has been most rewarding .
The fact that it did not become a burden is largely thanks to the support I have received .
I should like to thank Julie Hibbs who has typed and controlled the evolving book ; Alison McCauley undertook all of the bibliographic research with real enthusiasm .
Thanks are also due to the staff at Prentice Hall International who provided enormous support and encouragement .
I am also very grateful to those other computer scientists who have offered advice and / or references .
In particular I should like to thank John Reynolds , Jim Horning , Bob Tennant , Brian Randell , David Gries , and Jim King .
Finally , I should like to thank Tony Hoare , with whom co-operation is always so stimulating .

Atom is done .
Now the editorial processes grind away and eventually the official specification of the Atom Publishing Protocol will be an RFC substantially identical to draft - ietf - atompub - protocol - 17 ; it ’ll join RFC4287 as the official products of the IETF Atompub Working Group .
What ’s Next ? ·
Now we ’ll find out who ’s interested .
The Atom feed format is a success ; RSS is n’t going away , but a steadily - increasing proportion of the world ’s new feeds are Atom 1.0 .
I personally think the protocol ’s going to be a big deal ; here ’s why .
My track record as a prognosticator is good but not perfect .
There ’s one thing of which I ’m confident though : if Atompub takes off , it ’ll be in at least one area that makes no sense at all to me , seems completely crazy .
Atom and Me · I started getting interested in in Sam Ruby ’s “ Pie ” project in 2003 .
The IETF process started in 2004 .
So that ’s four years of my life , more or less .
I do n’t regret a moment of it .
I got to actually work , not just hang out , with Sam and Joe Gregorio and , well , if I start listing names , this entry will get out of control .
Except for Paul Hoffman , who combined IETF process expertise with deft interpersonal skills , exercised not least in putting me on a leash when I wanted to deal with blockages by applying extreme violence .
He ’s become a friend , and you ca n’t have enough of those .
I should also say thanks to Sun for paying me while I spent part of my time working on this .
Having said that , I think anything that makes the Net bigger and easier and more useful is good for us because after all we sell the iron ; so I think it was a decent investment .
Plus , well , I think the Internet and the Web really need the Atom protocol .
I ’m kind of hoping , though , that I can take a vacation from standards work for a while .
The IETF ?
Well , it ai n’t perfect , but work gets done .
It ’s absolutely intolerable , though , that the name of our spec co-editor Bill de hÓra will appear mis-spelled on the RFC because of the IETF ’s bone - headed ignorant backward - looking bigoted ASCII - only policy .
Speaking personally , it ’s a problem I ca n’t just live with , which means probably not much further work in the IETF .
Oh well .
What Do We Call It ? ·
The term “ Atom ” is hopelessly vague , and most people use it to refer to the feed format , which is fine .
We could say “ Atom Protocol ” or “ APP ” or “ Atompub ” ; let ’s see what shakes out .

Summary
The installation of Ubuntu is a major barrier to its spread and use .
This project aims to solve this problem by allowing installation from within Windows using an install .
exe file , and eliminating the need to partition the hard drive or burn a CD to install .
It will allow a faster and more user - friendly installation for Windows users , the ability to install without the risk of data loss through repartitioning , and the ability to install on ultra-portable laptops without CD drives .
Rationale
Approximately 90 % of desktop computers in the world , the target audience of Ubuntu , run Microsoft Windows .
Most Windows users are familiar with install .
exe programs , and know how to use them .
Few , however , know how to burn a CD from a .iso file , boot from a CD , shrink partitions , and install Ubuntu .
By providing Windows users with an installer they are more familiar with , we can ease their learning curve , and open Ubuntu to the vast market of casual computer users .
The elimination of the need for partitioning , and thus the chance of data loss , will help Ubuntu gain acceptance in the corporate world .
The elimination of the need for an installation CD will allow users without CD burners or spare CDs to try Ubuntu , ease burdens on ShipIt , and allow installation on ultra-portable laptops with no CD drives .
Use cases
Brenda is an inexperienced Windows user who is tired of viruses and crashes , so she decides to try out Ubuntu .
She then downloads the .iso file , and is confused about what to do with it .
She reads pages of installation guides , which overwhelm her , and she figures she has neither the time nor skill to switch to Ubuntu .
Following the release of the Ubuntu install.exe , though , she downloads it , runs it , clicks " OK " through the installer , reboots , and has a fully functioning and user - friendly OS .
Peter is an amateur video editor who is interested in trying out Ubuntu .
However , he hears that shrinking his NTFS partition and repartitioning may lead to irrecoverable data loss .
He does n't want to risk losing his several gigabytes of videos on his NTFS partition , but he has no means to back up all his data , so he grudgingly continues using Windows .
Following the release of Ubuntu install.exe , though , he rests assured that because no repartitioning is occurring , his data is safe .
He clicks his way through the user - friendly installer , and has an Ubuntu installation within minutes .
Jane and her coworkers are employees at WidgetTech Corporation who would like to use their favorite OS , Ubuntu , at work .
Since Ubuntu can do everything required for their job , their employers agree to let them use Ubuntu , so long as they keep Windows installed , in case there is a need for it .
However , the employers hear that there is a chance that all data on the computer 's hard drive may be lost while reformatting .
They do not want to spend precious time and money making backups of terabytes of critical data and restoring it in case it is lost , so the company does not allow employees to use anything other than Windows .
Following the release of Ubuntu install.exe , though , Jane and her coworkers show their employers that there is no chance of data loss during the Ubuntu installation , due to the lack of partitioning .
They are then permitted to install and use Ubuntu on their corporate desktops .
Mark is an Ubuntu user who has just bought an ultra-portable laptop .
He wants to install Ubuntu on it , but can't , because his laptop is too small to accommodate a CD drive .
However , following the release of Ubuntu install.exe , he just downloads the installer , runs it from the spot , reboots , and has Ubuntu ready for usage .
Implementation
The installer will be based on the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System , because it is flexible and open - source .
It will use the BattleTorrent plugin to download ubuntu.img and swap.img via BitTorrent , in order to conserve bandwidth .
As it is downloading , a progress bar will indicate how much longer it will take to download .
ubuntu.img will be the Ubuntu hard drive image .
It will be used as a loopmounted EXT3 filesystem , and will be placed in the C:\ubuntu directory .
ubuntu.img will be a preconfigured hard drive image , which already has all portions of the installation set up , except those specific to the hardware , such as the X11 configuration , and the user - specific portions , such as the home directory and timezone .
swap.img will be a hard drive image of the swap partition .
It will be placed in the C:\ubuntu directory .
The installer will ask the user to specify his desired username and password .
It will also detect the time zone and locale based on information in the Windows registry .
The installer will write this data into the file config. txt in the C:\ubuntu directory .
GRLDR , a modified version of GRUB , allows dual - booting the loopmounted hard drive image and Windows , and does n't require any changes to the MBR , as it writes to the Windows boot.ini , so it will be used as the bootloader .
This bootloader will be installed at the end of the installation , and the original boot .ini file will be backed up .
Once the bootloader is installed , the installer will have a " reboot into Ubuntu " button that will restart the system .
On the first bootup , the data from the config .
txt file generated by the installer will be read , and will be used to set up the system .
The hardware will be detected , and X11 and other hardware - dependent portions of the system will be configured .
All of this will be done automatically , and will not require user interaction .
Once this is done , booting will continue , and will boot into Ubuntu .
What 's Completed
In the prototype , the installer now automatically downloads and installs the initrd , kernel , disk image , and GRLDR via BitTorrent .
The disk image is now booting a standard Ubuntu 7.04 feisty installation with a modified initrd with ntfs - 3g support built in , and a standard feisty kernel .
The Windows - based uninstaller is now working
Windows NT , 2000 , and XP are fully supported .
Windows 95 , 98 , and ME are supported , but the disk images must be 4 GB or less due to the limitations of the FAT32 filesystem .
Windows Vista support is being worked on .
TODO
Install to a real linux partition like debian.exe --
Has already been completed , see UNetbootin
Automatic generation of /etc / fstab on first boot
Read values from the config .
txt file generated by the installer on the first boot and automatically configure the username , password , language , and timezone accordingly
The user 's password in the config .
txt file will have to be hidden or deleted , as it will be a security risk .
This can be done by adding a startup script to Ubuntu that will delete the config .
txt file on the first boot , after configurating the username , password , language , and timezone
A correct regeneration of initrd.img ( with ntfs - 3g enabled ) when upgrading the kernel - NicolòChieffo
Installation to the USB keydrive , with the BootLoader and uninstaller in the USB stick .
It can use and configure PPP modems and DHCP , to connect to the Internet .
Possible add -ons
Once Ubuntu has been installed , we may provide a wizard that offers to upgrade Ubuntu 's performance by shrinking or removing the NTFS partition , giving Ubuntu a dedicated EXT3 partition , and dumping the contents of the image file into it .
We may be able to resize the disk image if space on the Ubuntu partition runs out .
While the installer is downloading the disk images via BitTorrent , we may provide users with a tutorial to educate them about ubuntu .
The installer may read data from the Windows registry to detect hardware , download the necessary drivers to C:\ubuntu , and add a section to config .
txt that will instruct Ubuntu to install the drivers and set the hardware up on the first boot , in order to provide a better out - of - the - box experience for users .
The installer may import settings from programs , such as mail from Outlook , Outlook Express , or Thunderbird , and bookmarks from Internet Explorer or Firefox , place them in the C:\ubuntu directory , and add a section to config .
txt that will instruct Ubuntu to import these settings into the user 's profile on the first boot .
The importers from Thunderbird and Firefox could be used here .
USB memory stick
One could use install.exe to install Ubuntu in a USB keydrive from a Windows computer with Internet connection .

Environmentalists who sued the Bush administration for failing to issue legally - mandated climate change reports have won .
On Tuesday , a federal judge ruled that the administration had broken a 1990 law requiring the President to regularly issue two climate change plans , one guiding research and the other summarizing the effects of climate change in the United States .
The former report was due in 2006 , and the latter in 2004 .
Reports the Associated Press ,
The administration had claimed that it had discretion over how and when it produced the reports _ an argument the judge rejected Tuesday .
" The defendants are wrong , " Armstrong wrote in the 38 - page ruling .
" Congress has conferred no discretion upon the defendants as to when they will issue revised Research Plans and National Assessments . "
It 's certainly a victory for holding the government accountable to the law .
But in a way I hope the administration appeals the ruling and does n't release the reports .
At this point , they 'd probably be so hopelessly politicized that it'd be better to let the next administration do the job right .

Just in time for the most dangerous days of the year to drive -- July 3 and 4 -- the national Center for Excellence in Rural Safety ( CERS ) at the University of Minnesota today released a list of the states where Americans are more likely to die in a traffic crash on a rural road ; and Minnesota makes the top 15 .
According to the study , 72 percent of Minnesota 's traffic fatalities happen on rural roads .
While U.S. Census figures show that about two out of ten ( 21 percent )
Americans live in rural areas , the U.S. Department of Transportation has found that about six out of ten ( 57 percent ) highway deaths happen on roads that it considers rural .
" Millions of Americans will be driving this holiday weekend , and they would be wise to carefully consider these findings before they do , " said CERS Director Lee Munnich , professor in the University of Minnesota 's Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs .
" America 's rural byways seem so tranquil and safe , but the reality is that they can be as lethal as they are lovely . "
The states with the highest proportion of their total traffic fatalities occurring on rural roads are :
1 ) Maine ( 92 % )
2) North Dakota ( 90 % )
advertisement
3 ) South Dakota ( 89 % )
4 ) Iowa ( 88 % )
4 ) Vermont ( 88 % )
5 ) Montana ( 86 % )
6 ) Wyoming ( 84 % )
7 ) South Carolina ( 83 % )
advertisement
8 ) Mississippi ( 82 % )
9 ) Arkansas ( 81 % )
10 ) West Virginia ( 80 % )
15 ) Minnesota ( 72 % )
18 ) Wisconsin ( 68 % )
The state - by - state rural fatalities data reflects deaths on rural roads in 2005 and was compiled by CERS researchers using information from the U.S. Department of Transportation .
Rural roads are identified as those located outside of areas with a population of 5,000 or more .
The entire list is available at http://www.ruralsafety.umn.edu.
There are many reasons for America 's high rate of rural crash deaths .
Head - on collisions and driving off the road crashes -- both of which are disproportionately deadly -- are common on the two - lane , undivided highways prevalent in rural areas .
Rural roads , with lighter traffic and pleasant scenery , can easily lull drivers into a false sense of security .
An over - relaxed comfort level can lead to motorists driving at unsafe speeds , distracted , fatigued , unbelted or impaired , all of which increase the likelihood of a crash .
Additionally , emergency response time to a rural crash and hospital transport can be lengthy and thus jeopardize survival rate .
Crash victims are five to seven times more likely to die from their injuries unless they arrive at a trauma center in the first half - hour following the crash .
" All states need to improve rural highway safety , but the issue is particularly pressing in these states , " said Munnich .
" Fortunately , there 's much that can be done to prevent future deaths . "
CERS works to raise awareness of the problem of rural road fatalities and advocate policy changes impacting road design and driver behavior .
For instance , CERS advocates state adoption of primary seat belt laws , which allow law enforcement officers to pull people over for not using their seat belts .
States that enact primary seat belt laws have increased their seat belt usage rates dramatically , by an average of 14 percent , which in turn reduces the number of injuries and deaths .
" This is a public health issue we must take much more seriously , " said Munnich .
" Two years ago , 23,549 Americans died on rural roadways .
We are right to focus significant attention and resources on preventing things like AIDS , SARS , E coli poisoning and skin cancer , but we can't forget that this public health problem is even more deadly . "
Traveling America 's roads is particularly dangerous this time of year .
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , the top two days of the year for motor vehicle fatalities over the years 1986 - 2002 have been July 3 and July 4 .

Separation logic系の話．エイリアスしうるポインタとかヒープメモリとかについての性質を検証するためのプログラム論理．OSみたいなシステムレベルのCコードの正しさを検証したい．とりあえずkmallocの正しさを定理証明器上で検証したらしい．ちょっと「力ずく」っぽいが，メモリ上のデータを（抽象化しすぎないで）ちゃんとバイトレベルで定式化したとのこと．正確にはバイトレベルの表現と値レベルの表現を定義して，必要に応じて両方を行き来できるようにした．
Foundational proof carrying code系の話（実行系まで安全性の証明が付加されたプログラミング言語システムを構築したい）．証明を簡単にするために，意味論的型つけ( semantic typing ) を用いたい．そのためには，非叙述的多相型と（破壊的代入の可能な）参照セルを両方ともサポートするsemanticsが必要．Appel/Ahmedらのindexed modelと，中野のmodal modelを利用して，そういうKripke semanticsを構築したとのこと( cf. [ Nakano 2000 ] ) ．自分の研究に我田引水すると，安全性（一項関係）だけでなく等価性（二項関係）の証明にも有用かどうか？
[ Q by somebody ] Scottの不動点帰納法との関係は ? [ A ] わからないが，domain theory のかわりに自然数ベースの初等的モデ ル( indexed model ) を利用している ( ? )
Separation logicやambient logic（＆その拡張であ るcontext logic）を様相論理の一種で解釈する，という話？

i Phone Will Broker World Peace / Luscious uber - gizmo also rumored to cure brain cancer , provide oral sex .
All true !
Baby , the Cold War is so back on .
Did you hear ?
Dour , pale - as - vodka Russian President Vlad " Cold , Humorless Stare " Putin took one look at the war - hungry Bush - pocked American agenda for building a new missile shield and stockpiling fresh arsenals of WMD in eastern Europe ( It 's to protect us from those scary Iranian nukes !
BushCo stammered , obviously lying like dogs ) , slammed a shot of frozen Stoli and pounded his tiny white fist on the solid mahogany parliament table and said , " We will bury you , " just before spontaneously bursting into a glorious shower of silver confetti , pink flower petals and tiny black sparrows .
Wait , I might have that a little bit wrong .
I might have torqued my facts a little , my vision slightly askew , though surely you can understand given how right now it 's just so easy to become , you know , distracted , just slightly sidetracked , what with so many brutally numbing war stories and then this loud divine humming noise coming from Cupertino and what with this entirely enthralling quadruplet of dangerously beautiful new iPhone commercials now available to the world like sultry Siamese cats wearing shiny necklaces made of chocolate and Ecstasy and porn .
Wait , I might be exaggerating that just a little , too .
What can you do ?
Ah , but what a distraction it is .
Have you heard of the iPhone ?
Have you heard of , say , oxygen ?
Duh .
Of course you have .
Fact is , not only has the entire universe heard of this glorious and eminently distracting gizmo , but anticipation for the damnable thing is apparently running so scaldingly high for its now - official June 29 release date that Apple is rumored to be downplaying the rollout just a bit .
It 's true .
Apple PR is apparently actually being forced to manage expectations so there 's not some sort of titanic weeping backlash when those 3 million iPhones finally hit the streets and everyone goes ,
Hey , what the hell , you mean it 's only a cell phone and an iPod and a Web browser and an e-mail program and a digital camera and an IM client and photo library and a movie player in one gorgeous tiny gizmo the size of a tin of Altoids ?
That 's it ?
That 's all it does ?
You mean it does not confer instant transcendental enlightenment ?
It does not make my skin look younger and more supple ?
It will not make my wife want to deliver more enthusiastic oral sex or make my kids actually want to speak to me or perhaps get Israel and Palestine to stop hating on each other and it wo n't help us all numb the savage karmic pain of the fact that our president remains a childish hell - born imbecile ?
Well , maybe just a little .
Because this , I am hereby forecasting , will be the feeling .
This is the sort of hope we put on new goods from Jobs and Co. these days .
And why not ?
Why not allow ourselves the momentary pleasure of presuming that , for one of the few times in our short history , a delightful human gadget might enter the technological food chain and maybe , just maybe , make life just a tiny bit more ... oh , I do n't know .
Elegant ?
Sensual ?
Cohesive ?
Tactile ?
There are worse things to imagine , no ?
Perhaps you do not believe me .
Perhaps you 're all " oh , pish posh humbug bulls --" ( in which case I doubt you are reading this column right now because you are probably 116 years old , and dead .
But never mind that now ) .
Then perhaps you should just watch the new ads yourself , over at Apple.com and on YouTube and in your florid orgasmic gizmo daydreams , which I admit is a crazy proposition in and of itself as normally I would never encourage anyone to intentionally watch a commercial ( except perhaps that one brilliant European ad for condoms ) , but , hey , it 's the iPhone , the most hyped and most anticipated new gadget since The Cone vibrator and the iPod - enabled fireplace and hence if you care at all for modern tech and elegant design and Steve Jobs ' godlike aura you simply have to pay attention because it's , like , the law .
The ads are , as you might expect , beguiling , and lucid , and nearly perfect .
They do nothing but show the lovely thing in action , up close and entrancing , this little $ 500 toy doing so much so fluidly with such a graceful and intuitive interface you can only sit back and watch and go , Oh please .
Come on .
Nothing is that good .
Nothing is that easy .
Nothing can possibly deliver on such a promise of making my media - soaked life so much more clear and likable and harmonious and peaceful dreamlike juicy happy .
Wait , can it ?
Here 's the thing : Maybe this time such a distraction can be healthy .
Maybe this time it's a good form of anticipation , the kind of sheer unadulterated consumerist nirvana that actually lifts you out of this brutal spiritual stasis and allows you a glimpse of a world sans scowls and warmongering and incessant error messages .
You think ?
Hey , I know how it is .
There you are , trying like any good American to be all wary and jaded and depressed for the thousandth time as you read about , say , the bloodiest month on record in Iraq for U.S. war casualties or how Bush has nominated yet another absolutely awful candidate for a high - ranking judicial slot or even the one about Scooter Libby taking the 2.5 - years - in - prison bullet for Dick " Waking Nightmare " Cheney , when boom , you see the ad about how the iPhone senses which way it 's rotated and the screen adjusts accordingly , and suddenly you 're whipped out of your torpid lethargy and spanked back into some sort of shallow but delightful oh - my - God - it 's - so - cool happiness .
Really , why not just give in ?
Why not , in this case , just enjoy it ?
Yes , the thing 's wildly overhyped .
Yes , it 's just a glorified telephone and , yes , the army of Apple haters is right this minute sharpening their knives in anticipation of slamming every tiny flaw they can find in the iPhone , right along with how much they hate anything Apple does because , you know , who cares about simplicity and grace and thoughtful functionality in modern technology ?
Right .
It 's OK .
Let 'em rage .
I say let the iPhone divert our collective attention , just for a few precious , suspended moments .
Why not ?
After all , with the iPod as its stunning , groundbreaking predecessor , it 's one of the few things -- unlike Putin or Lindsay or even our wayward and war - weary national agenda -- that seems to actually have earned it .

Italian media have been publishing transcripts of an inquiry into the policing of the 2001 Genoa G8 summit in which officers admit fabricating evidence against protesters .
Suspected truths which had already emerged are being officially confirmed
Suspected truths which had already emerged are being officially confirmed
Rai Uno television
At the centre of the inquiry is a police raid on a school being used as a dormitory by anti-globalisation demonstrators , in which dozens of people were injured .
A senior officer , Pietro Troiani , reportedly admitted under questioning that two petrol bombs allegedly found at the school were planted by police to justify the raid .
In fact , they had been found elsewhere in the city , in the Corsa Italia , where protesters and police had clashed earlier in the day .
Mr Troiani's lawyer later denied any involvement of his client in fabricating evidence , saying he had only handed the bombs to another police official , reports say .
Police disciplined
Out of 93 people arrested at the school in the early hours of 22 July , 72 suffered injuries , and all were later released without charge .
" Now that the investigation into the G8 events is drawing to a close , suspected truths which had already emerged are being officially confirmed , " reported the Italian television channel , Rai Uno .
At least 77 police officers have been under investigation for alleged brutality , and three police chiefs have been moved to other jobs .
Transcripts of some of their interviews have been published in Italian newspapers , including Italy 's leading left - wing daily , La Repubblica , and the Genoa daily newspaper , Il Secolo XIX .
Demonstrators said riot police beat them with clubs , smashed windows and wrecked computers in the raid .
The BBC's Bill Hayton was among those who stood outside the Diaz school , hearing the screams coming from within , then watching bodies brought out on stretchers .
When the police left he went in and saw blood on the walls , floors and radiators of an upstairs room .
' Simulated ' stabbing
One of the key witnesses is Michele Burgio , Mr Troiani 's driver , who admits to planting petrol bombs at the school .
According to the media reports , Mr Troiani later admitted to prosecutors that fabricating evidence was a " silly thing " to do .
Attention is also focusing on a knife attack on one police officer , Massimo Nucera .
A senior police chief , Franco Gratteri , head of the Central Operations Services , is quoted as saying that the stabbing was not carried out by protesters , but was simulated .
Mr Gratteri says the " attack " could have been aimed at justifying the excessive use of violence used by some flying squads .
Hundreds of police and protesters were injured in street battles during the summit , which was attended by violent anarchists as well as peaceful protesters .
One protester died after being shot by police .
April 16 , 2007  --
By all accounts , Lou Pearlman , the millionaire pop music mogul who virtually invented boy bands , has led a charmed life .
It was his charm , investigators say , which helped him to bilk more than 1,400 people out of hundreds of millions of dollars in a classic pyramid investing scheme .
Pearlman is now at large , and his whereabouts remain unknown .
His alleged victims -- some of them now destitute -- are left to wonder how they were taken by the man who created and once managed the Backstreet Boys and ' N Sync .
" I lost everything , " said John Spears , an 80 - year - old , wheelchair - bound veteran who invested his life savings , some $ 200,000 , in what he was led to believe was an insured interest - bearing savings fund .
According to Florida state officials , Pearlman swindled people out of $ 317 million and , more surprisingly , bilked banks out of an additional $ 150 million .
That money allowed him to lead a lavish lifestyle .
Pearlman owned a Rolls Royce Phantom , a Gulfstream private jet and a 15,000 - square - foot Florida mansion .
State and federal investigators , as well as lawyers for the alleged victims , say Pearlman and his associates sold investors , many of them senior citizens , phony securities which he called an " employee investment savings account " through his company Trans Continental Airlines Inc .
In numerous documents obtained by ABCNEWS.com , Trans Continental assured investors that their money was insured both through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the well - known insurance brokers AIG and Lloyd's of London .
By offering reasonable interest rates , investors did not initially believe they were being scammed , lawyers for the victims say .
Some initial investors were paid quarterly with money invested by new investors .
Others , like Spears , " never saw a dime . "
" It was clever how he did stuff , " said Robert Persante , a Florida lawyer who represents eight people -- including Spears -- who accuse Pearlman of fraud .
" He would advertise to senior citizens and say he was FDIC insured but he was n't and could n't be . "
" He 'd charm people with his showbiz connections ...
He even gave some people paraphernalia from the boy bands , " Persante said .
" Mom and pop see FDIC in an ad and they are conditioned to trust that .
People were disinclined to ask an attorney because they thought , ' Do I really need to , if this is FDIC insured ? ' "
" Only , the FDIC does n't cover con artists .
It only covers the failure of federal lending institutions , " Persante said .
The Florida Office of Financial Regulation , which initiated the investigation , has been unable to contact Pearlman since he left the United States in January 2007 .
On Feb . 1 , 2007 , Pearlman sat in a theater in Berlin and watched as his latest boy band , the German sensation US5 , received a Goldene Kamera Pop International Band award .
Within days of his band receiving that award , perhaps the last triumph in Pearlman 's career , a Florida judge had appointed a receiver over Trans Continental 's few remaining assets .
Within weeks , FBI and IRS agents stormed the company 's Orlando offices .
" It was a Ponzi [ fraudulent ] scheme , " said Robert Rosenau , chief of financial investigations for the Florida Office of Financial Regulation .
" Money invested with [ Trans Continental ] was diverted elsewhere to shore up his other companies , " he said .
In an emergency court motion filed yesterday , Soneet Kapila , the court - appointed bankruptcy trustee , wrote that Pearlman had shuttled money among more than 100 companies from AC Productions to Zeppelin Restaurant .
" The trustee also has reason to believe that the debtor [ Pearlman ] utilized many of these business entities in the perpetration of the ' ponzi ' scheme alleged by creditors and the state of Florida , and / or funneled monies from the ' ponzi ' scheme through many of these business entities , " Kapila wrote .
" When someone invests outside a regulated industry , they need to do due diligence , " said Rosenau .
" There are a lot of resources .
There are many places to determine what is [ insured by the ] FDIC . "
Monty Montgomery , a 67 - year - old retiree living in St. Petersburg , Fla. , learned about those " many places " the hard way .
Montgomery said it was not until he read an article about Pearlman in a September issue of the St. Petersburg Times that he bothered to check with the FDIC and learned the federal agency did not protect his investment .
In promotional materials obtained by ABCNEWS.com , Trans Continental promises that " Your investment is 100 percent insured .
The FDIC shall cover up to $ 100,000 and Lloyd's of London shall insure up to $ 1,000,000 @ account . "
In other documents ( note the fine print ) , including a brochure given to new investors , the company said , " All funds shall be insured under FDIC standards with Lloyd's of London coverage . "
As early as 1999 , Lloyd's of London learned Trans Continental was using its name to promote sales of securities and contacted Pearlman , telling him to stop .
Pearlman wrote back to Lloyd 's explaining that a Trans Continental agent " mistakenly relayed incorrect information , " and he included a letter supposedly sent to investors explaining and apologizing for the mistake .
Montgomery said that when he began investing with Trans Continental in 2006 , he was told the FDIC , Lloyd 's and AIG would insure his investment .
Montgomery was among the estimated 3 percent of investors who actually saw an initial return on their money .
Spears , the disabled veteran , never got any money back .
When he tried to withdraw $ 20,000 of the $ 200,000 he invested to give his children as Christmas presents , he was told on several occasions he would have to wait .
Pearlman , he said , called him personally to apologize for the delay and promised he would soon get his money .
He never received anything .
The FBI would not discuss the details of their ongoing investigation .
However , Kevin Farrington , an FBI spokesman , confirmed the bureau " participated in a search warrant at Pearlman 's residence and business several months ago in an effort with several other agencies . "
Farrington said he " ca n't get into where [ Pearlman is overseas ] , " but that " generally , we work with international law enforcement agencies if an investigation moves overseas . "
Pearlman was last seen in Germany .
Calls to Triple - M Music , the Berlin - based company that manages his band US5 , were not returned .

That 's the problem : President Bush suggests uninsured children go to hospital emergency rooms for their care President Bush suggests uninsured children go to hospital emergency rooms for their care .
After the Senate Finance Committee approved an expansion of the federal Children 's Health Insurance Program to cover nearly 10 million kids , President Bush offered a strange rationale for threatening to veto it .
" People have access to health care in America , " he told an audience in Cleveland .
" After all , you just go to an emergency room . "
As any executive of a Houston hospital can attest , that is precisely the problem created by the high number of uninsured people in the United States .
Texas has the highest rate of uninsured children in the nation , and Harris County the highest in the state .
Those who lack insurance coverage frequently delay seeking medical care until they are seriously ill .
Then they swamp hospital emergency rooms that are required by law to treat them even if the patient has no ability to pay .
Since emergency care is far more expensive than a scheduled visit to a doctor or clinic , hospitals wind up with large costs that they then pass on to insured patients using their overtaxed facilities .
As a result , insurance companies raise their rates ever higher to cover the increased payouts , making their policies too expensive for more working families .
The result is a health care system spiraling out of control and more children left unprotected and in poor health .
The senators who voted 17 - 4 to expand the S - CHIP understand the situation .
Their plan would boost funding for S - CHIP from $ 25 billion to $ 60 billion for the next five years with the aim of covering 3 million more children .
The measure would provide a uniform eligibility level of three times the poverty line for a family with four children , $ 51,510 .
The increase would be primarily funded by a steep hike in federal taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products
The Bush administration insists on holding the increase to $ 5 billion over the five year period , a level that U.S. Sen .
Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , said would not even maintain the current number of children enrolled .
Administration officials claim that expanding the program would undermine the insurance industry .
But having more children insured would lower costs passed on to private insurers and employers .
Perhaps the most dubious reason cited by the White House for opposing the increase concerns the tax hike on cigarettes , which would go up from 39 cents a pack to a dollar .
According to spokesman Tony Fratto , it would unfairly penalize the poor " to finance a new subsidy for the middle class . "
He did n't mention that higher tobacco taxes would likely reduce teen access to cigarettes and lower the health care costs of treating millions of Americans for respiratory disease and cancer caused by smoking .
America 's health care system is broken .
Expanding S- CHIP is a stopgap measure that would expand the number of Americans with access to health care .
Doug has already written about how our courts have denied Angel Raich her right to life but I think this is such a fundamental miscarriage of justice that it deserves further discussion .
Angel Raich suffers with a brain tumor , chronic pain , seizures , Scoliosis , TMJ and other medical conditions ; her physician has determined that cannabis is her only effective treatment option for these conditions .
According to Raich ’s website , from 1996 to 1999 she could not move the right side of her body and had to use a wheelchair .
After smoking the cannabis as recommended by her doctor , she was able to ditch the wheelchair and better manage her pain , and products all over the world are helping to do this increasingly often .
Companies in Canada provide a wide range of products that can have similar effects , known as CBD Oil UK wide .
Cannabis has done more than restore Raich ’s mobility and alleviate pain .
According to her physician Dr. Frank Lucidio , taking her off her cannabis regimen would cause “ imminent harm ” which would likely lead to her death by starvation or malnutrition .
Many of the beneficial notes have been spoken about passionately by other experts on the subject , such as Christopher Wright , and there is a growing movement across the States to allow people access to this medication due to the known benefits .
Yet somehow the powers that be in their infinite wisdom have determined that Raich ’s life is not worth saving .
Their precious prohibition of marijuana is more important .
If you ’re fortunate enough to live in a medicinally legal area and you frequent dispensaries , you may want to change up how you buy your cannabis while also adding to the collection of strains you can smoke if you buy weed online instead .
It seems that Raich will have to risk going to jail if she wants to live .
This is n’t the first time Raich has had legal setbacks regarding this issue .
Back in 2005 , SCOTUS ruled against her 6 - 3 in Gonzales vs. Raich .
The majority opinion even acknowledged that without the cannabis she could die .
The following is a post I wrote on June 9 , 2005 at Fearless Philosophy for Free Minds in reaction to this disastrous ruling .
State , Economic , and Individual Rights Up in Smoke
I cannot say that I was surprised with the unfortunate 6 - 3 Supreme Court ruling ( Gonzales vs. Raich ) in which the court determined using marijuana for medicinal purposes violates federal law .
In the process of fighting the war on drugs , civil liberties of this great country have been compromised over and over again from courts all across the land .
My interest in this case initially was due to my opposition to the war on drugs .
The reasoning this court used to justify the ruling , however ; should disturb every capitalist , supporter of states ’ rights , fiscal conservative , constructionist , and those who value limited government , irrespective of how each views the war on drugs .
In the majority opinion delivered by Justice Stevens ( joined by Kennedy , Souter , Ginsberg and Breyer ; Scalia wrote his own opinion concurrent with the ruling ) , the ruling recognized that Respondents Raich and Monson may indeed benefit from using marijuana for their conditions , written as follows :
They [ Raich and Monson ] are being treated by licensed , board - certified family practitioners , who have concluded , after prescribing a host of conventional medicines to treat respondents ’ conditions and to alleviate their associated symptoms , that marijuana is the only drug available that provides effective treatment .
Both women have been using marijuana as a medication for several years pursuant to their doctors ’ recommendation , both rely heavily on cannabis to function on a daily basis .
Indeed Raich ’s physician believes that forgoing cannabis treatments would certainly cause Raich excruciating pain and could very well prove fatal .
( p. 3 , paragraph 2 )
So what ’s the problem then ?
If Raich ’s condition could become fatal because she stops using marijuana , she now has to risk arrest by federal agents or chose to die by following the law ?
What happened to this â€˜culture of life ’ conservatives like to talk about ?
Despite the benefits as determined by the court ’s majority , the court still managed to find reason to rule against a law passed by the people of California .
As disturbing as denying medication to those who truly need it is , the reasoning is even more cause for alarm .
The ruling reads :
Our case law firmly establishes Congress ’ power to regulated purely local activities that are part of an economic “ class of activities ” that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce …
As we stated in Wickard , “ even if appellee ’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce , it may still , whatever its nature , be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce …
When Congress decides that “ ‘ total incidence ' ” of a practice poses a threat to a national market , it may regulate the entire class .
( p.13 - 14 , paragraph 3 )
What kind of flawed reasoning is this ?
This so - called interstate commerce is grown , sold , and used locally .
How does this local activity affect commerce in other states ?
It appears that this bad court decision is based on a few other bad court decisions , loosely interpreting the â€˜commerce clause ’ ( Section 8 ; Clauses 3 and 18 ) of the U.S. Constitution .
The obvious problem is that the court is granting power to the congress to manipulate the economy however it sees fit regardless of if the commerce is interstate or not .
This is frightening .
Using this line of reasoning , any activity one could choose to participate in or not participate in could be considered an â€˜economic activity , ’ subject to the will of the U.S. Congress !
If you think I am being an alarmist , read Justice Clarence Thomas ’s dissent .
Thomas gets straight to the point writing :
Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never been bought or sold , that has never crossed state lines , and that has had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana .
If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause , then it can regulate virtually anything - and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers .
( Justice Thomas Dissenting , p.1 paragraph 1 or p.62 paragraph 1 in the pdf. format )
What does Thomas mean when he states that “ … under the Commerce Clause , then it can regulate virtually anything … ” ?
Thomas continues :
If the majority is to be taken seriously , the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees , clothes drives , and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States .
This makes a mockery of Madison ’s assurance to the people of New York that the “ powers delegated ” to the Federal Government are “ few and defined , ” while those of the States are “ numerouse and indefinite . ” ( Justice Thomas Dissenting , p.13 paragraph 1 or p.74 paragraph 1 in the pdf. format )
It is truly amazing the lengths our Federal Government will go to continue fighting the war on drugs .
The casualties in this battle are people such as Diane Monson and Angel Raich who must find an alternative treatment for their conditions ( though by the court ’s own admission , marijuana is probably the best treatment available for these women ) , the California voters who passed the proposition , the free market , the States , the Constitution , and ultimately , everyone who believes in limited government .
Brian over at Enfranchised Mind always has something interesting to say .
Just recently it seems he 's been grappling with C# and trying to work out a good abstraction for a particularly recalcitrant COM object .
The first problem he has is here :
Thus I was coding this in C# , because of the three possible languages , VB.
NET , C# , and C++ , I disliked C# the least .
This is his first error .
He 's chosen his implementation language based on personal preference rather than suitability to the task .
I 'm sure that Brian has his reasons for disliking C++ , but in this case his dislike has cost him dear .
It turns out that C++ has the abstractions that he misses from OCaml and the solution that he 's after is an almost trivial use of them .
Let 's take a look at it .
Here is a function not entirely unlike the sort of thing that he 's struggling with :
void print ( const std:: string & what , bool &succeed ) { if ( ! succeed ) { succeed = true ; throw std::invalid_argument ( " succeed is false " ) ; } std::cout << what << std::endl ; }
We can invoke it in one of two ways :
bool f( false ) , t( true ) ; print ( " Hello " , t ) ; // works print ( " Hello " , f ) ; // throws an exception
This simply allows us to control whether or not it throws .
Notice that if we can call it a second time then it will always succeed because it sets the second parameter 's value to true before throwing the exception .
Here is the sort of thing that he needs for his attempts and their recovery :
template < typename R > R execute ( boost : : function < R( void ) > f ) { int count ( 0 ) ; while ( true ) { try { return f( ) ; } catch ( std:: invalid_argument &e ) { if ( ++ count > 3 ) throw ; std::cout << " Caught exception ... " << e.what ( ) << " ... retrying " << std::endl ; //
Recovery procedure } } }
It 's a simple function that takes another function to try up to three times .
If you 've not done any functional programming in C++ then the type boost : : function < R( void ) > probably looks a little odd .
It simply describes a function that returns an R and does n't take any arguments .
So how do we get one of these function objects ?
The easiest way is to use a lambda .
We 're going to use something akin to partial function application , but we 're going to apply all of the parameters in one go but not execute the function .
Here is how to do that :
bool local_var ( false ) ; boost : : function < void ( void ) > functor ( boost : : lambda :: bind ( print , " Hello world " , boost : : ref ( local_var ) ) ) ;
The variable functor now contains our lambda which we can execute whenever we like by just calling it :
functor ( ) ;
Here is a complete listing that you can play around with
#include < boost/ function.hpp > # include < boost / lambda/bind.hpp > # include < iostream > # include < stdexcept > void print ( const std:: string & what , bool &succeed ) { if ( ! succeed ) { succeed = true ; throw std::invalid_argument ( " succeed is false " ) ; } std:: cout << what << std::endl ; } template < typename R > R execute ( boost : : function < R( void ) > f ) { int count ( 0 ) ; while ( true ) { try { return f( ) ; } catch ( std:: invalid_argument &e ) { if ( ++ count > 3 ) throw ; std::cout << " Caught exception ... " << e.what ( ) << " ... retrying " << std::endl ; // Recovery procedure } } } int main ( ) { try { bool local_var ( false ) ; boost : : function < void ( void ) > functor ( boost : : lambda :: bind ( print , " Hello world " , boost : : ref ( local_var ) ) ) ; std::cout << " About to try " << std::endl ; execute ( functor ) ; } catch ( ... ) { std::cout << " Exception caught " << std::endl ; } }
The output is this :
About to try Caught exception … succeed is false … retrying Hello world
Many people dislike C++ for what they think it is , rather than what it actually is .
There 's plenty to dislike about it as a language , but do n't let that fool you into thinking that it 's power and expressiveness is in the same league as Java or C# .
“ Heavily Doctored ” by MTV ’s venerable newsreader , Kurt Loder , is an embarrassingly flawed and tendentious attack on Michael Moore ’s new documentary “ Sicko “ .
This tediously protracted diatribe is neither a review nor a balanced examination of the important public policy issues raised by the film .
The article begins with Loder reciting several of the health care horror stories exposed in the film .
His tone is deceptively favorable as he describes the purpose of good muckraking .
But it does n’t take long for him to plant his ideological flag .
After alleging that Moore is a brazen con man who cherry - picked facts and manipulated interviews , Loder lobs this rhetorical grenade :
“ As a proud socialist , the director appears to feel that there are few problems in life that ca n’t be solved by government regulation … ”
Moore regularly articulates his pride in being an American – and one who advocates the fruits of capitalism for himself and all Americans .
But Loder does n’t stop with this ad hominem insult .
He continues with the utterly false and unsupported ( and prejudicially phrased ) assertion that “ Americans have never been keen on socialized medicine . ”
Someone needs to introduce Loder to the most popular government - managed programs ever created – Social Security and Medicare .
Additionally , polls show that Americans would overwhelmingly approve of a national health insurance program , even if it would require higher taxes ( 64 % for , 35 % opposed ) .
Still , Loder persists in mischaracterizing the reality of the health care crisis and the response to it in the United States and around the world .
In a rebuttal to Sicko , he offers up a short and undistinguished 2005 documentary called “ Dead Meat . ”
This film is the flip side of Sicko , recounting alleged horror stories of government - managed health care .
Although he devotes six paragraphs to the film , Loder neglects to provide some illuminating facts about Dead Meat and it ’s producers .
The film made its debut at the Liberty Film Festival , which describes itself as “ a forum in the heart of Hollywood for conservative and libertarian filmmakers . ”
In 2006 the festival operations merged with ultra-right wing provocateur David Horowitz ‘ Freedom Center .
The film ’s credits include special thanks to the rightist Manhattan Institute , the Pacific Research Institute , and the Heartland Institute .
The latter is particularly notable for its refusal to acknowledge the dangers imposed by global warming or smoking – both of which they feel are frauds based on junk science .
All three institutes are partially funded by pharmaceutical companies or lobbies .
The producers have also released films critical of immigration reform protests and what they perceive as a left - wing assault on free thought in U.S. universities .
Health care expert , Loder , does n’t hesitate to dispense advice on policy matters .
His prescription for reform is firmly planted in the free - market medicine camp .
And despite the fact that there is nothing identifying this article as an editorial , it is overflowing with opinion and innuendo .
Here is another example of his insertion of bias that is presented without context but with the expectation that we accept it on faith :
“ When governments attempt to regulate the balance between a limited supply of health care and an unlimited demand for it they ’re inevitably forced to ration treatment . ”
Loder does n’t seem to appreciate that there is no system that produces a greater degree of rationing than one that denies care to all but the fortunate .
The kind of system that is presently in place in the U.S .
The rest of the article provides incontrovertible evidence that , in addition to being an inferior analyst and a prejudiced observer , he also lacks any sign of a sense of humor .
He totally misses the satirical points made in episodes involving French excesses in care and the now famous Guantanamo landing .
As such , Loder proves that he is ill - suited for this type of assignment .
His readers would be better served if he would just put his sunglasses back on and take his mark on the red carpet in time to welcome back the Spice Girls .
Update : I was just alerted to this column wherein Loder predicted that “ An Inconvenient Truth ” would win the Oscar for best documentary :
“ Actually , the best film in this category is Amy Berg ’s devastating “ Deliver Us from Evil , ” a true investigative report on a shameful cover - up by the Roman Catholic Church of 20 years of child - molesting by one of its priests , Oliver O’Grady .
But Al Gore ’s environmental alarmism – much of it since heavily questioned – no doubt plays better in Beverly Hills . ”
Loder is apparently fully subscribed to the anti-science , free market philosophy of the three institutes cited above ( whom I will now refer to as the “ Dead Meat Coalition ” because that perfectly describes the contents of their craniums ) .
Is the online world as important to Internet users as the real world ?
Large numbers of Internet users hold such strong views about their online communities that they compare the value of their online world to their real - world communities , according to the sixth annual survey of the impact of the Internet conducted by the USC - Annenberg School Center for the Digital Future .
Among a broad range of findings about rapidly - evolving methods for online communication , the 2007 Digital Future Project found that 43 percent of Internet users who are members of online communities say that they “ feel as strongly ” about their virtual community as they do about their real - world communities .
“ More than a decade after the portals of the Worldwide Web opened to the public , we are now witnessing the true emergence of the Internet as the powerful personal and social phenomenon we knew it would become , ” said Jeffrey I. Cole , director of the USC Annenberg School Center for the Digital Future .
“ The Internet has been a source of entertainment , information , and communication since the Web became available to the American public in 1994 , ” said Cole .
“ However , in 2006 we are beginning to measure real growth and discover new directions for the Internet as a comprehensive tool that Americans are using to touch the world . ”
The findings about online communities and more than 100 other issues are published in the 2007 Digital Future Project , the comprehensive annual examination of the impact of online technology on America .
The project surveys more than 2,000 individuals across the United States , each year contacting the same households to explore how online technology affects the lives of Internet users and non-users .
It also examines how changing technology , such as the shift from Internet access by modem to broadband , affects behavior .
The 2007 Digital Future Project found that Internet use is growing and evolving as an instrument for personal engagement – through blogs , personal Web sites , and online communities .
Online communities : a catalyst for connection and activism
Online communities and offline action -- The Digital Future Project found that involvement in online communities leads to offline actions .
More than one - fifth of online community members ( 20.3 percent ) take actions offline at least once a year that are related to their online community .
( An “ online community ” is defined as a group that shares thoughts or ideas , or works on common projects , through electronic communication only . )
Social activism – Participation in online communities leads to social activism .
Almost two - thirds of online community members who participate in social causes through the Internet ( 64.9 percent ) say they are involved in causes that were new to them when they began participating on the Internet .
And more than 40 percent ( 43.7 percent ) of online community members participate more in social activism since they started participating in online communities .
Online communities : daily use --
A significant majority of members of online communities ( 56.6 percent ) log into their community at least once a day .
Member interaction --
Online communities are online havens for interaction among members .
In 2006 , 70.4 percent of online community members say they sometimes or always interact with other members of their community while logged in .
Internet users : reaching out across the Web
Posting information -- Growing percentages of Internet users are going online to post information , whether on a blog , posting photos , or maintaining a personal Web site .
--
The number of Internet users in America who keep a blog has more than doubled in three years ( now 7.4 percent of users , up from 3.2 percent in 2003 ) .
-- Likewise , the number of Internet users who post photos online has more than doubled in three years ( now 23.6 percent of users , up from 11 percent ) .
--
The number of users who maintain their own Web site continues to grow steadily ( now 12.5 percent of users ) .
The Internet and social links
The Digital Future Project found continuing growth of the Internet for connection to family and friends – but with virtually no negative effects on time spent in person with them .
New friends , online and in person -- Internet users are finding growing numbers of online friends , as well as friends they first met online and then met in person .
In 2006 , Internet users report having met an average of 4.65 friends online whom they have never met in person .
Internet users in 2006 report an average of 1.6 friends met in person whom they originally met online -- more than double the number when the Digital Future Project began in 2000 .
Does the Internet increase regular contact with other users " --
Responding to a question last asked in 2002 , 42.8 percent of Internet users agree that going online has increased the number of people they regularly stay in contact with -- marginally less than the 46.6 percent who voiced the same response four years ago .
Internet users and communication with family and friends --
Although more than 40 percent of users say that the Internet has increased the number of people with whom they stay in contact , a lower percent say that since starting to use the Internet they are communicating more with family and friends .
In 2006 , 37.7 percent of Internet users agree that since they started to go online they are communicating more with family and friends -- down from 45.5 percent in 2002 .
Does the Internet change the amount of time spent with friends and family face - to - face " --
While large percentages of Internet users say that going online increases contact with family and friends , almost all users report that the Internet has no effect on the time spent with close friends or family face - to - face .

In my last post I had a little DSL embedded in Haskell .
Defining the Fibonacci function looked like this : Compare that with ordinary Haskell :
Why do they look different ?
Could I make my DSL look exactly like Haskell ?
First , lets look at the parts that look the same , like .
In Haskell , withof type , this just an expression and it has some value ( depending on ) .
In the DSL , withof typethe value of this expression is in fact an abstract syntax tree , namely ( something like ) .
The reason we can make the same expression mean different things depending on the type is that numerical operators likeare overloaded , and so they do different things forand .
So what about , can we overload that too ?
Theoperator is already overloaded and has type .
But theoperator in the DSL returns , so there 's no way we can use ; the return type is fixed .
What to do ?
Well , there 's nothing sacred with the operator , it 's just another name , but defined in the Prelude .
We can make our own if we hide the Prelude .
So let 's do that , but carefully .
We want to be able to still useas before , and for ourreturn type .
So we need to overload the return type as well as the argument type .
Before we do that , let 's define a class that is analogous to , but for Boolean values .
We 'll need this class soon .
Thetype has a few important functions and values , let 's put those in the class .
First we import the Prelude explicitly , this allows us to hide some things we want to redefine .
The we define the Boolean class , which gives new meaning to some prelude functions .
Finally , we make an instance saying that the new , andbehave as the old ones for good oldfashioned .
After this definition we can use the Boolean operators just as before , they are just overloaded now , but forthey resolve to their old meaning .
So back to comparison , first .
The new ( we need to hide the Prelude one ) is now more general ; the return type is overloaded as well .
Too avoid ambiguities we have a functional dependency .
The type of the values we compare will determine the type of the Boolean result .
( This is n't necessary , but without this we might need many type annotations . )
Nothing is a member of this class , so we need to add the types we need .
We really should all types that have equality , but let 's do two samples .
And since the whole point of this was to allow special equality for ourvalues , let 's look at that too .
A new ( simplified ) looks similar , both the class and the instances .
So now for the next challange .
The Haskell Fibonacci function uses , and the DSL uses a special function .
Well , now we are stuck .
These is no way at all to overload the specialsyntax in Haskell ; it 's wired in .
This could be viewed as a design mistake in Haskell , but so it is .
So could we use thefunction in the Haskell version too ?
Well , not the original , it has type .
We need to overload that too .
Again , we add a functional dependency .
And again , it will save some ambiguities .
The obvious instances : Oh , and the instance forthat I skipped before .
After this effort we can write the body of the Fibonacci function the same way for both typeand type , namely And what about all these new classes and instances .
how do we package them to make them easy to use ?
We hide the stuff we want to override , and re-export the rest of the Prelude .
Any module that wants to use this new Prelude now has to say :
After this all regular Haskell code works as before , but we can also take advantage of the new overloadings .
Enough for today .

Senator Inhofe Vows To Block " Live Earth " Concert In D.C .
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Reading articles like this simply make me giddy .
I just ca n’t wait to hit the keyboard and type about the lunacy that people like Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma are blasting off about .
Once again , it all has to do with global warming — or does it ?
Inhofe is busting buttons over Live Earth ’s plans to hold one of seven worldwide concerts on the west end of the Capitol ’s Mall .
Late last week , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) attempted to pass the authorizing measure for Live Earth by unanimous consent .
Â Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) raised an objection on the floor , seeking more time for his side to look at the resolution .
Inhofe then went off saying , â€ œThere has never been a partisan political event at the Capitol , and this is a partisan political event . ”
Is it a partisan event , M. Inhofe ?
Or are you using the health of the planet as a partisan issue because you ’re pissed off at , oh say , Al Gore ?
For the record , the resolution to allow Live Earth to party on was sponsored by both a Democrat AND a Republican .
It ’s not secret that Inhofe greatly dislikes Al Gore and pretty much everything he stands for .
Besides calling global warming “ the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people ” , the Senator also got into a heated exchange with the former V.P. last week in D.C.
From the article ,
“ Inhofeâ€™s latest challenge to Gore comes after their forceful exchange during last weekâ€™s hearing in the environment committee , when Chairwoman Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) stepped in to stop Inhofe from dictating terms of response to the 2000 presidential nominee .
Gore declined to sign a personal energy usage pact proffered by Inhofe . ”
Anyways , organizers of the event have booked the Mall regardless — for a cool $ 5 million .
None of the money involved in hosting the concert will come from American taxpayers .
Now , they ’re just waiting for congressional approval to move forward ; an issue they say is silly since that part of D.C. has been used for Earth Day events before .
Methinks the Gore association is driving the largest wedge in between their plans .
Â
That , or Inhofe is just pissed that Gore now gets more chicks than he does .
I ’m going to go with the latter .

More Details
Who brought this concept to public awareness ?
Norman Vincent Peale was an American minister and author , who popularized the concept of positive thinking , especially through his book ‘ The Power of Positive Thinking ’ , which was published in 1952 .
In his book , which is still popular nowadays , he provided practical instructions designed to help the reader achieve an optimistic attitude .
His techniques involved using affirmations and visualizations .
How the Power Positive Thinking Works
The following stories illustrate how the power of positive thinking works .
Richard ’s Story
Richard applied for a new job , but he did n’t believe he will get it , since his self - esteem was low , and he considered himself as a failure and unworthy of success .
He had a negative attitude toward himself , and therefore , believed that the other applicants were better and more qualified than him .
Richard ’s mind was occupied with negative thoughts and fears concerning the job , for the whole week preceding the job interview .
He actually , anticipated failure .
Ad - Continue reading below .
On the day of the interview , he got up late , and to his horror he discovered that the shirt he planned to wear was dirty , and the other one needed ironing .
As it was already too late , he went out wearing a wrinkled shirt and without eating breakfast .
During the interview , Richard was tense , negative , hungry and worried about his shirt .
All this , distracted his mind and made it difficult for him to focus on the interview .
His overall behavior made a bad impression , and consequently , he materialized his fear and did not get the job .
Jim ’s Story
The second story is about Jim , who applied for the same job too , but approached the matter in a different way .
He was sure and confident that he was going to get the job and had a good measure of self - esteem .
During the week preceding the interview , Jim often visualized himself making a good impression and getting the job .
He also and repeated affirmations to that effect .
In the evening before the interview , he prepared the clothes he was going to wear , and went to sleep a little earlier .
On day of the interview , he woke up earlier than usual , and had ample time to eat breakfast , and then to arrive to the interview before the scheduled time .
Who eventually got the job ?
It was Jim , because he made a good impression , and therefore , was hired for the job .
What do we learn from these two stories ?
Was there any magic used ?
No , everything happened in a natural way .
The difference was in attitude , behavior and approach .

Positive Thinking Is a Way of Life
With a positive attitude we experience pleasant and happy feelings .
This brings brightness to the eyes , more energy , and happiness .
Our whole being broadcasts good will , happiness and success .
Even our health is affected in a beneficial way .
We walk tall , our voice is more powerful , and our body language shows the way we feel .
Positive and negative thinking are contagious .
We affect , and are affected by the people we meet , in one way or another .
This happens instinctively and on a subconscious level , through words , thoughts and feelings , and through body language .
Is it any wonder that we want to be around positive people and prefer to avoid negative people ?
People are more disposed to help us , if we are positive and in a good mood .
Most people dislike and avoid anyone broadcasting negativity .
Negative thoughts , words and attitude , create negative and unhappy feelings , moods and behavior .
When the mind is negative , poisons are released into the blood , which cause more unhappiness and negativity .
This is the way to failure , frustration and disappointment .
The Benefits of Positive Outlook
A positive mental attitude affects many aspects of life in a favorable way .
It affects career and success , health and state of mind , and everything else in every area of your life .
It has a good effect on your mental health and emotional health , because it makes you more confident and happy , and therefore , less worried and anxious .
This kind of mindset reduces stress and anxiety .
Less stress and anxiety means better immunity system and improved physical health .
It makes you more optimistic , friendly and considerate , and this of course , can improve your relations with people .
With this attitude , you program your mind to be aware of opportunities to improve your life , and you have the confidence to take advantage of these opportunities .
With this mental outlook , you feel more motivated , and can more easily motivate people to improve themselves and their life .
With a positive frame of mind there is faster recuperation , both physically and emotionally .
It helps you avoid negative self talk and shift to positive self talk .
This kind of outlook is one of the main keys to success , since you expect only constructive results , and no other option .
Focusing on positive thoughts awakens positive emotions and contributes to making people happy people .
Obtaining the above mentioned results requires some training of the mind and changing its focus from negativity to positivity .
There are various techniques that can help you make this shift .
Harnessing the Power of Positive Thinking
In order to turn the mind toward the positive , some inner work is required , since attitude and thoughts do not change overnight .
Here are a few instructions and tips for harnessing this power and using it effectively :
Read books and articles about this topic , think about its benefits , and persuade yourself to try it .
Realize that the power of your thoughts is a mighty power that is always shaping your life .
This is usually a subconscious process , but it is possible to make the process a conscious one .
Even if the idea seems strange to you , give it a try .
Strive being more conscious of what is going on in your mind .
It might happen that friends or family members might try to dissuade you from changing your attitude and way of thinking .
If this happens , ignore what say or think about you .
Use your imagination to visualize only favorable and beneficial situations .
Use positive words in your inner dialogues , or when talking with others .
Smile a little more .
Once a negative thought enters your mind , you have to be aware of it , and strive to replace it with a constructive one .
If the negative thought returns , replace it again with a positive one .
It is as if there are two pictures in front of you , and you have to choose to look at one of them , and disregard the other .
Persistence will eventually teach your mind to think positively and ignore negative thoughts .
In case you experience inner resistance and difficulties when replacing negative thoughts with positive ones , do not give up , but keep looking only at the beneficial , good and happy thoughts in your mind .
It does n’t matter what your circumstances are at the present moment .
Think positively , expect only favorable results and situations , and circumstances will change accordingly .
If you persevere , you will transform the way your mind thinks .
It might take some time for the changes to take place , but eventually they will .
Another useful technique is the repetition of affirmations .
This technique is similar to creative visualization , and can be used together with it .
Positive Thinking Words and Phrases
Add constructive , optimistic , helpful and encouraging words to your conversations .
While thinking , strive to use such words too , to drive away negative thoughts and negative words .
In this way , you will change your mindset from negative to positive , and your life will change accordingly .
This will also make you more popular and liked by the people around you and the people you meet .
Here Is a List of Words to Use :
Happy , Successful , Satisfied , Joy , Encouragement , Motivated , Agreeable , Attractive , Beautiful , Charming , Kind , Patient , Accomplish , Creative , Harmony , Inspirational , Constructive , Helpful .

Fascinating New Scientist article ( for subscribers only , but there ’s a copy here ) on conspiracy theories , and why we believe them :
So what kind of thought processes contribute to belief in conspiracy theories ?
A study I carried out in 2002 explored a way of thinking sometimes called “ major event – major cause ” reasoning .
Essentially , people often assume that an event with substantial , significant or wide - ranging consequences is likely to have been caused by something substantial , significant or wide - ranging .
I gave volunteers variations of a newspaper story describing an assassination attempt on a fictitious president .
Those who were given the version where the president died were significantly more likely to attribute the event to a conspiracy than those who read the one where the president survived , even though all other aspects of the story were equivalent .
To appreciate why this form of reasoning is seductive , consider the alternative : major events having minor or mundane causes — for example , the assassination of a president by a single , possibly mentally unstable , gunman , or the death of a princess because of a drunk driver .
This presents us with a rather chaotic and unpredictable relationship between cause and effect .
Instability makes most of us uncomfortable ; we prefer to imagine we live in a predictable , safe world , so in a strange way , some conspiracy theories offer us accounts of events that allow us to retain a sense of safety and predictability .
Other research has examined how the way we search for and evaluate evidence affects our belief systems .
Numerous studies have shown that in general , people give greater attention to information that fits with their existing beliefs , a tendency called “ confirmation bias . ”
Reasoning about conspiracy theories follows this pattern , as shown by research I carried out with Marco Cinnirella at the Royal Holloway University of London , which we presented at the British Psychological Society conference in 2005 .
The study , which again involved giving volunteers fictional accounts of an assassination attempt , showed that conspiracy believers found new information to be more plausible if it was consistent with their beliefs .
Moreover , believers considered that ambiguous or neutral information fitted better with the conspiracy explanation , while non-believers felt it fitted better with the non-conspiracy account .
The same piece of evidence can be used by different people to support very different accounts of events .
This fits with the observation that conspiracy theories often mutate over time in light of new or contradicting evidence .
So , for instance , if some new information appears to undermine a conspiracy theory , either the plot is changed to make it consistent with the new information , or the theorists question the legitimacy of the new information .
Theorists often argue that those who present such information are themselves embroiled in the conspiracy .
In fact , because of my research , I have been accused of being secretly in the pay of various western intelligence services ( I promise , I have n’t seen a penny ) .
Like most of their neighbors in the sprawling , ramshackle Oasis Mobile Home Park , the Aguilars have no heat , no hot water .
On cold nights , the family of eight stays warm by bundling up in layers of sweaters and sleeps packed together in two tiny rooms .
Bathing is a luxury that requires using valuable propane to boil gallons of water .
So the farmworker clan spends a lot of time dirty .
Jose Aguilar , a wiry 9 - year - old , has found a way around the bath problem .
He just waits until dinner .
“ My mom makes frijoles , ” he said , “ then I take a bath in that water . ”
Jose and his family live in a world few ever see , a vast poverty born in hundreds of trailer parks strung like a shabby necklace across the eastern Coachella Valley .

Out here -- just a few miles from world - class golf resorts , private hunting clubs and polo fields -- half - naked children toddle barefoot through mud and filth while packs of feral dogs prowl piles of garbage nearby .
Thick smoke from mountains of burning trash drifts through broken windows .
People -- sometimes 30 or more -- are crammed into trailers with no heat , no air - conditioning , undrinkable water , flickering power and plumbing that breaks down for weeks or months at a time .
“ I was speechless , ” said Haider Quintero , a Colombian training for the priesthood who recently visited the parks as part of his studies .
“ I never expected to see this in America . ”
Riverside County officials say there are between 100 and 200 illegal trailer parks in the valley , but the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition says the number could be as high as 500 .

California Rural Legal Assistance says as few as 20 parks are legal , and they are often as dilapidated as the illegal ones .
When county inspectors locate a park without permits , they prefer to let owners bring the place into compliance through loan and grant programs rather than evict the tenants .
Some of the largest and poorest parks are on the Torres Martinez Indian Reservation where they are not subject to local zoning laws and the county can’t monitor safety , hygiene and building standards .
The reservation is also home to the worst illegal dumps of any tribe in California , Arizona or Nevada , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
The federal agency has closed 10 of the 20 most toxic dumps and cited four of the largest trailer parks for health violations .
Despite the conditions , park owners say they are providing a vital service in an area where housing prices have soared .
“ Before the parks , they were living in their cars , in the desert and bathing in the canals .
Five guys would pay 50 bucks a month to share a camper shell , ” said Scott Lawson , a tribal member and co-owner of the Oasis park on the reservation .
“ Nobody cared when they lived like that , only when they moved into trailers .
You ca n’t expect the poorest to live like the wealthiest .
They feel comfortable here ; it ’s like being back in Mexico .
They tell me that . ”

Lawson ’s 300 - trailer park has been cited by the EPA for clean - water violations and was recently ordered to stop pumping raw sewage into the nearby Salton Sea .
“ We had some citations about water but it ’s because we did n’t know how to test it , ” he said .
“ I ’m not ashamed of my place .
There are a lot worse places than mine . ”
Exactly how many people live in the trailer parks is unknown , but social workers estimate tens of thousands .
The biggest park , Desert Mobile Home Park , or “ Duroville , ” has more than 4,000 residents and can be seen off California 195 near Thermal .
Others are on private property and virtually invisible to passing motorists .
The tenants are almost entirely Latino farm or construction workers .
Many are in the United States legally , but plenty are not .
Their average income , according to county officials , is about $ 10,000 a year .
Many parents rent out their children ’s rooms for extra money , leaving kids to sleep on floors or in sheds .
Many families keep warm by burning grape stakes , which fill their trailers with toxic fumes .

In one nameless park on the reservation off Avenue 70 in Thermal , trailers with broken windows and unhinged doors sit against piles of trash .
Box springs , tires , car parts are stacked 10 feet high .
Sewage runs behind the trailers , and wild dogs yap and howl .
“ This place has some of the worst conditions I have seen , ” said Sister Gabriella Williams , who does community outreach in the parks and is raising money to build a learning center for residents .
“ And it ’s actually gotten worse since I last saw it . ”
She picked her way through a yard that doubled as a trash heap .
“ The park owners have to look into their own conscience as to why they run these kinds of places with these kind of conditions , ” she said .
“ They would n’t want this in their backyard .
They would n’t tolerate it .
We all need to recognize the dignity in each other . ”

Former resident Conrrada Valenzuela said she went three months without electricity , living by candlelight .
Maria Renosa , 35 , from Guatemala , lives in the park now .
She makes $ 7.25 an hour picking broccoli and shares a battered , sparsely furnished trailer with six other adults and her children , Edith , 2 , and Frank , 3 .
Renosa ’s husband was recently deported for being undocumented .
“ It would cost him $ 5,000 to return , ” she said .
“ I am not going back .
What am I going to do there ?
I ’d love to live somewhere else , but here it only costs $ 360 a month . ”
The EPA has cited park owner Robin Lawson for clean - water violations ; Lawson could not be reached for comment .
He is Scott Lawson ’s brother .
Another brother , Kim , operated a vast , illegal dump for more than a decade that was shut down last year by a federal judge .

The presence of the parks on the reservation has frustrated Torres Martinez Tribal Chairman Raymond Torres .
“ The owners started off with good intentions , then I think it overwhelmed them , ” he said .
“ I have a real problem with it .
Someone is going to get hurt .
I ’d like to see the parks gone and the owners start over again . ”
But in the complex world of tribal sovereignty , Torres cannot close the parks ; only the Bureau of Indian Affairs can .
The bureau said last week that parks on the reservation are illegal because they do not issue bureau - approved leases to tenants .
They are now threatening legal action against Duroville and said other parks could be next .
Trailer parks began springing up on Indian land largely because of a county crackdown .
In 1998 , after several fatal accidents caused by faulty wiring , Riverside County began closing parks that did not have permits and threatening to sue others not up to code .
Faced with outrage from farmworker advocates and the Roman Catholic Church , who feared thousands could be rendered homeless , officials backed off , but not before many panicked park dwellers had moved onto the reservation .

“ We wish we could wave a magic wand and make them go away , ” said County Supervisor Roy Wilson .
“ But we can ’t . ”
Adding to the misery is Kim Lawson ’s dump .
Since 1992 , it has burned paint cans , car batteries , plastic pipe and treated wood and other waste , throwing so many toxins into the air and soil that EPA said the dump represented an “ endangerment [ that ] can be considered imminent and increasing over time . ”
And the dump , its smoke blowing for miles up and down the valley , sits right beside Duroville .
A 2003 EPA memo reported some areas of the dump contained levels of dioxin 20 times the national average .
Dioxin , a carcinogen , is one of the deadliest manufactured substances .
According to agency documents , soil samples revealed dioxin , PCBs and asbestos in Duroville itself .
Citing the risks of cancer and other illnesses , the EPA urged the dump ’s immediate closure .
The park remained open because the danger to it was not deemed “ imminent , ” said agency attorney Letitia Moore .

Four years after the EPA recommendation , a federal judge in Riverside closed the dump in August .
On Thursday , the judge ordered Lawson to pay $ 46.9 million to help clean up the mess .
Since the facility was padlocked , there have been 20 fires -- most the result of spontaneous combustion , said Ray Paiz , battalion chief with the Riverside County Fire Department .
One fire in November nearly forced the evacuation of Duroville and nearby schools .
Smoke in the parks is as common as wild dogs and swirling dust .
Health workers report that children suffer high levels of pulmonary illnesses , coughs , infections and skin rashes .
“ These are almost Third World conditions , ” said Rosa Lucas , a nurse who runs the Oasis Clinic , across the road from a trailer park .
“ It ’s unbearable out there when there is burning .
You literally ca n’t go outside . ”
Although poverty is endemic in the parks , nothing rivals Duroville for sheer blight .

The 40 - acre park is a grim , colorless warren of dirt roads with more than 300 trailers tightly packed inside .
It ’s often hard to tell an abandoned scrap heap from a home .
There are start - up businesses -- car dealerships , a small taco stand and a restaurant specializing in Michoacan food -- squeezed in amid the clutter .
Trash blows here and there .
Toddlers , some naked from the waist down , wander around in fetid muck .
A wall surrounds part of the place , a thin barrier separating it from the dump .
What began as occupants of a few trailers seeking refuge from the county has turned into a vast slum bearing streets named after members of park owner Harvey Duro ’s family .
Duro declined to comment for this article .
Efforts by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to close Duroville fizzled in 2003 when the owner agreed to make basic electrical and sewage improvements .
Still , officials said , he has failed to provide tenants bureau - approved leases defining minimum living standards .
“ He will have to come up with an approved lease or we will shut him down , ” said James Fletcher , the bureau ’s superintendent for Southern California .

Fletcher said all the parks on Indian land could be closed if they do n’t provide leases .
“ If that happens , where do the people go ? ” he asked .
“ I do n’t know . ”
Duroville is a bastion of poverty divided between the poor and the desperately poor .
Among the most destitute are the Purepecha , an indigenous people from the Mexican state of Michoacan who speak neither Spanish nor English but their own language , Purepechan .
They are often mocked by other Latinos who consider them backward .
In their culture , girls often marry young and drop out of school to have children .
Anjelica Serrano , a Purepechan , watched her children play in the dirt .
“ I got married at 15 , ” she said through an interpreter , “ and have five children . ”

She is 24 .
At night , the dark streets come alive with thumping rap and mariachi music pouring from cars .
Ice cream vendors work the narrow streets .
Because there are no sidewalks , pedestrians keep a wary eye on traffic .
Men gather in front of trailers , some drinking themselves into oblivion .
Others have hard stares and watchful eyes .
Residents say drug dealing is rife .
Theresa Argueta , 42 , would leave if she could afford to .
She lives in a two - bedroom trailer with her husband and eight children .
The four boys sleep in the living room , the four girls in a tiny bedroom .
Inside , the trailer is festooned with rosaries and statues of Our Lady of Guadalupe .
“ The smoke has affected my children ’s health , ” she said .
“ When the smoke comes , they get bloody noses and have difficulty breathing . ”

On the other side of the park , Cesar Rafael , 17 , a Purepechan , lives in his parents ’ trailer .
He and several other students at Desert Mirage High School in Thermal made a short video about their world , “ The Contaminated Valley , ” which was shown at school .
“ I wanted people to see another side of life , ” he said .
“ Everything is poisonous here , even the water is poisonous .
And nobody really cares about it .
We are invisible . ”

WHAT kind of people live in this building ? ”
That is often the first question brokers are asked by apartment hunters — be they couples with children , retirees seeking peace and quiet or 20 - somethings prone to the occasional raucous party .
But in recent months , thousands of brokers have learned that in answering that question , they might just be breaking the law .
Many real estate ads , for instance , use “ family friendly ” to describe large apartments .
But according to a strict interpretation of federal , state and local fair - housing laws , that is illegal .
“ If a family with children wants to know if there are other children the same age in a building , we ’re supposed to say , ‘ You should stand outside the building between 2 and 5 p.m. and see who walks in , ’ ” said Michele Kleier , the president of Gumley Haft Kleier .
“ But how do you say something like that with a straight face ? ”
A glance at real estate listings online reveals that there are still companies whose ads say things like “ Best family building in New York , ” but there are many more that in the interest of fairness or out of fear of a lawsuit have cleansed their ads and are retraining their brokers .
Check out the above video .
It 's just about the coolest thing I have ever seen .
My initial thought was " this has got to be fake " but Zcorp is a real corporation and the process seems plausible , especially the way that simple models take several hours to " print " out .
I did n't know such things were possible , but it looks like somebody found a way .
I guess they took inkjet and laserjet technology and added a 3rd dimension to it ( thus , the " Z " , as in the Z - axis ) , using some sort of plaster - like material to form the objects .
I just think it 's so amazing that they got this crazy - ass idea to work .
I bet it does n't come cheap , though .
What 's more , scientists are using similar technology to try and " print " organs ( like , as in human organs ) at the cellular level .
Imagine a world where waiting for a liver transplant does n't involve waiting for a donor but waiting for the printer to finish .
Of course , the error messages will get that much more annoying : " Out of BioInk .
Please insert fresh flesh cartridge .
Or you will die .
" I can only imagine that something this powerful would be insanely expensive .
If this technology is going to come down to the masses we 're going to have to get the word out to the people who matter , the people who can really make a difference .
Yes , that 's right : Pornographers .
Once the porn industry gets ahold of this and starts making life - sized models in a big-ass printer the world will never quite the same .
Of course , you can already predict which organs will be the first to reach the mainstream .
Just be careful what you ask for when you go to the printer .

Saudi Arabia
had its first palace political upheaval about a decade after the death of its founder King Ibn Saud .
That was when a group of influential princes staged a palace coup against their brother ( or half - brother ) King Saud Bin Abdulaziz .
Crown Prince Faisal al Saud was a major drive behind the coup , which forced Saud to abdicate in favor of Faisal .
After that there were no serious palace upheavals , not that we know about anyway .
There was an incident in the late 1950 ’s when a group of rebellious princes ( The Free Princes ) sided with Nasser of Egypt and flew to Cairo in exile .
One of them was Prince Talal Bin Abdulaziz , brother of the king and father of Prince Al Waleed .
Another unrelated incident was when king Faisal was assassinated by one of his nephews in 1975 .
resumed openly and in full force after King Salman took over in 2015 .
There was a protracted turmoil as the king positioned his son MBS to gain absolute power over the country .
That turmoil did not end when Mohammed took over absolute power , he felt insecure with too many important princes in prominent positions .
So he went about cutting them down to size with purges .‘ known ’ major purge was in the fall of 2017 , when a large number of businessmen , officials , and princes ( including the once high - flying Prince Al Waleed ) were incarcerated in thefor weeks and months .
Many were shaken down for a share of their wealth , which they gladly gave up in exchange for restricted freedom and only within the kingdom .
There have been other smaller purges since then , but nothing involving the most prominent princes who were so close to ascending the Saudi throne .
These princes were politically emasculated , apparently .
shock .
Some of the most senior princes , in fact the highest princes in the kingdom were arrested yesterday .
No charges announced yet , almost certainly none will be .
Senior prince Ahamd Bin Abdulaziz is an elderly son of , the founder of the kingdom .
He was often mentioned as a possible heir during the past decade .
But the main catch of this new purge is Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef ( MBN ) , the former crown prince who was deposed after King Salman picked his own son ( MBS ) .
The third mentioned captive is a brother of MBN , a former deputy minister .
Of course in such a system , a prince is never alone : he has many aides , sycophants , minions , and allies .
So we can assume that many others have been arrested as well with these three prominent princes .
Some of these other important detainees will also be princes .
So , the circle , the radius of the purge , widens by nature , and covers more people over time , both royals and hapless non-royals .
Meanwhile , the circle of princes and potentates left untouched by the purges shrinks .
was not historically known as an unstable country that experienced domestic political shock .
Not in the royal palaces anyway .
Not that any outsiders would notice .
It may return to its past normal form after one person consolidates his secure power to such an extent that there will be no need to fear new upheavals .
Maybe no more purges , but I doubt it .
This is not his grandfather ’s world anymore , nor is it his grandfather ’s kingdom anymore .

Was there an Armenian genocide during World War I ?
While it was happening , no one called the slaughter of Armenian Christians by Ottoman Turks " genocide . "
No one could :
The word would n't be coined for another 30 years .
But those who made it their business to tell the world what the Turks were doing found other terms to describe the state - sponsored mass murder of the Armenians .
In its extensive reporting on the atrocities , The New York Times described them as " systematic , " deliberate , " " organized by government , " and a " campaign of extermination . "
A Sept. 25 , 1915 , headline warned : " Extinction Menaces Armenia . "
What the Turks were embarked upon , said one official in the story that followed , was " nothing more or less than the annihilation of a whole people . "
Foreign diplomats , too , realized that they were observing genocide avant la lettre .
American consular reports leaked to the Times indicated " that the Turk has undertaken a war of extermination on Armenians , especially those of the Gregorian Church , to which about 90 percent of the Armenians belong . "
In July , US Ambassador Henry Morgenthau cabled Washington that " race murder " was underway -- a " systematic attempt to uproot peaceful Armenian populations and . . . to bring destruction and destitution upon them . "
These were not random outbreaks of violence , Morgenthau stressed , but a nationwide slaughter " directed from Constantinople . "
Another US diplomat , Consul Leslie Davis , described in grisly detail the " reign of terror " he saw in Harput and the corpses of " thousands and thousands " of Armenians murdered near Lake Goeljuk .
The mass deportations ordered by the Turks , in which hundreds of thousands of Armenians were crammed into freight cars and shipped hundreds of miles to die in the desert or at the hands of killing squads , were far worse than a straightforward massacre , he wrote .
" In a massacre many escape , but a wholesale deportation of this kind in this country means a longer and perhaps even more dreadful death for nearly everyone . "
Other eyewitnesses , including American missionaries , provided stomach - clenching descriptions of the " terrible tortures " mentioned by Morgenthau .
Women and girls were raped , then forced to march naked through blistering heat .
Many victims were crucified on wooden crosses ; as they writhed in agony , the Turks would taunt them : " Now let your Christ come and help you ! "
Reuters reported that " in one village , 1,000 men , women , and children are reported to have been locked in a wooden building and burned to death . "
In another , " several scores of men and women were tied together by chains and thrown into Lake Van . "
Talaat Pasha , the Turkish interior minister who presided over the liquidation of the Armenians , made no bones about his objective .
" The Government . . . has decided to destroy completely all the indicated persons " -- the Armenians -- " living in Turkey , " he wrote to authorities in Aleppo .
" An end must be put to their existence . . . and no regard must be paid to either age or sex , or to conscientious scruples . "
Was there an Armenian genocide during World War I ?
The Turkish government today denies it , but the historical record , chronicled in works like Peter Balakian 's powerful 2003 study , " The Burning Tigris , " is overwhelming .
Yet the Turks are abetted in their denial and distortion by many who know better , including the Clinton administration and both Bush administrations , and prominent ex-congressmen - turned - lobbyists , including Republican Bob Livingston and Democrats Dick Gephardt and Stephen Solarz .
Particularly deplorable has been the longtime reluctance of some leading Jewish organizations , including the Anti-Defamation League , the American Jewish Committee , and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , to call the first genocide of the 20th century by its proper name .
When Andrew Tarsy , the New England director of the ADL , came out last week in support of a congressional resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide , he was promptly fired by the national organization .
Shaken by the uproar that followed , the ADL finally backed down .
The murder of a million Armenians at the hands of the Ottoman Turks in 1915 , it acknowledged yesterday , was " indeed tantamount to genocide . "
Now the other organizations should follow suit .
Their unwillingness to acknowledge that the Turks committed genocide stems from the fear that doing so may worsen the plight of Turkey 's beleaguered Jewish community or may endanger the crucial military and economic relationship Israel has forged with Turkey .
Those are honorable concerns .
But they cannot justify keeping silent about a most dishonorable assault on the truth .
Genocide denial must be intolerable to everyone , but above all to those for whom " never again " is such a sacred principle .
And at a time when jihadist violence from Darfur to Ground Zero has spilled so much innocent blood , dissimulation about the jihad of 1915 can only aid our enemies .
The Armenian genocide is an incontestable fact of history .
Shame on anyone who refuses to say so .

If a restaurant , dry cleaner , or home - repair business provided inferior goods or shoddy services , it is likely that the concern would go belly - up .
Yet when the U.S. government makes a blunder , the more its citizens reward its failure with further money and authority .
For example , after the Bush administration exacerbated the worldwide threat from Islamic terrorists by invading and occupying two Muslim nations , spied on Americans without warrants  which is both illegal and unconstitutional  to “ urgently ” combat such terrorism , and then saw its attorney general dissemble about the espionage program , Congress has actually rewarded the administration for its actions .
Afraid of being labeled “ soft on terrorism ” after an administration report cleverly stoked public fear by hyping al - Qaeda ’s regrouping , the legislators not only granted the administration legal authority for such warrantless domestic spying , but widened it to include cases in which terrorism is not suspected .
Now the government may listen in on every phone call made by Americans to or from overseas .
Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , has vowed that this cowardly travesty will be rectified when Congress reconvenes in September ; but now that it ’s law , President Bush need only veto the bill and obtain the votes of one - third of one chamber of Congress to block any changes to the horrific provisions .
At this point , the one scant hope seems to be that a more conservative Supreme Court would really be “ strict constructionist ” and rule that the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution  which should protect people from unreasonable searches and seizures  makes no exception to the requirement that wiretapping warrants be subject to judicial approval .
Not even for reasons of “ national security ” does the Fourth Amendment waive warrants .
In fact , protecting citizens ’ rights during especially stressful situations was considered quite deliberately in the design of the Constitution .
This example is not the only self - generating demand for government activism that has arisen from the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
Although al - Qaeda had no presence in Iraq under Saddam Hussein , the Mesopotamian branch rose in opposition to the U.S. occupation , and now is causing mayhem by launching numerous suicide attacks against both military and civilian targets .
Yet with a straight face , George W. Bush maintains that the U.S. must continue expending U.S. and Iraqi lives and hundreds of billions of dollars in Iraq to battle a threat he helped generate .
He is also arming former enemies in Iraq  the Sunni guerrillas  to help battle the destructive group .
Trust in the guerrillas may be misplaced , and could come back to haunt the United States later or exacerbate the ongoing civil war .
Furthermore , after the elimination of Saddam Hussein ’s regime in Iraq  Shi’ite Iran ’s greatest rival  it was predictable that the strength of America ’s greatest strategic competitor in the Persian Gulf region would grow .
It is unwise to conduct military action that is likely to help your chief rival , but the zealous Bush administration did exactly that .
After the United States created an 800 - pound Iranian regional gorilla , it then felt the need to sell $ 20 billion dollars ’ worth of arms to shore up its skittish , oil - rich , Sunni Gulf allies , and to try to buy some cooperation from them in supporting the Shi’ite - Kurdish government in Iraq .
These sales in turn meant that the United States had to open its wallet  hiking by 25 percent the already huge military aid subsidies to the Gulf states ’ nervous rival Israel , to an average of $ 3 billion per year .
Finally , in the chain of largesse , aid to Egypt , a potential rival of Israel , also had to be increased to an average of $ 1.3 billion per year .
Thus , to compensate for its bungling , the United States is stoking an arms race in a volatile region , which could lead to further catastrophes .
Most of the U.S. public does not seem to notice that its government ’s actions have exacerbated or even created foreign threats , which that same government then says it needs more resources in order to counter .
Instead of demanding that their government cease its excessive military interventions and occupations , arms sales , and foreign military assistance , and insisting that Congress cut off funding for such actions , the U.S. public rewards a government that not only performs poorly against those threats , but actually exacerbates them .
The public would never stand for such failure from private business .

Statue unveiling in Washington :
Bush , Democrats resurrect anticommunism in service of US “ war on terror ”
By Bill Van Auken
14 June 2007
US President George W. Bush was joined by a crowd of right - wing Republican ideologues and several Democrats Tuesday for the unveiling of yet another monument in the already statue - and memorial - crowded streets of Washington , D.C .
This rather unimpressive 10 - foot bronze statue , modeled on the papier - mâché figure of “ Liberty ” erected by the protesting Chinese students in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , has been dubbed the “ Victims of Communism Memorial . ”
The monument , the pet project of the right - wing Heritage Foundation think tank , has been 17 years in the making .
Much of the funding for the statue came from the government of Taiwan , with other money contributed by anti-communist émigré organizations and from some governments in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union .
The chairman of the commission that organized the statue ’s building is one Lee Edwards , a Heritage Foundation regular and “ historian ” of the Republican right , whose latest book is a paean to Reagan ’s former attorney general , Edwin Meese .
The commission ’s “ honorary chairman ” was George W. Bush .
Carved on the pedestal of the statue are the words , “ To the one hundred million victims of communism and to those who love liberty . ”
The 100 - million figure was invoked by virtually all of the speakers .
In his remarks , Bush described communism as “ an ideology that took the lives of an estimated 100 million innocent men , women and children . ”
He went on to include in that figure all those who died in famines in the Soviet Union and China , Ethiopians killed by the Mengistu military junta , Miskito Indians who died during the US - backed contra war against Nicaragua and Cubans who drowned trying to get to Florida by boat .
The crimes carried out by the Stalinist regime that usurped power in the Soviet Union are without question massive and horrific .
The aim of those who erected the monument in Washington , however , is to equate those who carried out these crimes with their first and principal victims , the entire generation of Marxists who led the October 1917 revolution and the tens of thousands of socialist opponents of Stalinism within the USSR , who were systematically exterminated in the Moscow Trials and the great terror of the 1930s .
Of course , the US officials who were the predecessors of those erecting the monument in Washington viewed this act of political genocide with grim satisfaction , recognizing in the murder of Trotskyists , and all those identified with socialist and Marxist opposition to the Stalinist bureaucracy , an irrevocable turn by the Kremlin against the revolutionary internationalist policy identified with Lenin , Trotsky and the October Revolution .
The hypocrisy of those erecting and dedicating the monument by no means ends there .
If one were to utilize the same methodology in calculating the number of victims that can be attributed to the crimes of capitalism , it would produce the justification for a far larger memorial .
They would include not only those tens of millions killed in two World Wars , the Holocaust , the US wars in Korea , Vietnam and Iraq as well as innumerable CIA - backed counterrevolutionary bloodbaths from Indonesia to Guatemala , but also the countless victims murdered or worked to death under the colonial regimes established by capitalist states in the oppressed countries .
And what about the hundreds of millions condemned to die from hunger and disease by a world economic system driven by profit ?
It is estimated that six million infants under the age of five , the vast majority of them in the oppressed countries , die each year because they lack clean water or elementary forms of health care .
These basic necessities are denied to them because of the impoverished conditions to which capitalism condemns billions of human beings all over the planet .
Even more directly , what can one say of the historically unprecedented rise in the mortality rate in Russia following the dissolution of the Soviet Union ?
The number of excess deaths resulting directly from the restoration of capitalism has been estimated at more than 1.3 million in the first four years alone .
Needless to say , no monument is in the works for these innumerable victims of capitalism .
And , if Bush and company came out to cry crocodile tears for the victims of Stalinism , it was not , as they sanctimoniously claimed , to honor their memory or record history ’s lessons .
Rather , it was to prepare new crimes to further the interests of capitalism and to employ anticommunist demagogy in an attempt to deny that there is any possible alternative to global militarism and social inequality .
As it quickly became clear at the monument unveiling , the victims of Stalinism were meant to serve merely as a prop for furthering and justifying the war policies that are being pursued by Washington .
Bush and other speakers essentially attempted to draw an improbable equal sign between communism and those responsible for the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
“ Like the communists , the terrorists and radicals who have attacked our nation are followers of a murderous ideology that despises freedom , crushes all dissent , has expansionist ambitions and pursues totalitarian aims , ” he told the crowd gathered in front of the new statue .
He continued : “ Like the communists , our new enemies believe the innocent can be murdered to serve a radical vision .
Like the communists , our new enemies are dismissive of free peoples , claiming that those of us who live in liberty are weak and lack the resolve to defend our free way of life . ”
No one at the ceremony was so impolite as to point out that those blamed for the attacks of September 11 were Washington ’s allies in the “ struggle against communism ” barely 20 years ago , when the CIA poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the Mujahideen fighting against the Soviet - backed regime in Afghanistan .
In those days , President Ronald Reagan , whose memory was invoked ad nauseam at the statue ceremony , proclaimed these “ freedom fighters ” — Osama bin Laden among them — the “ moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers . ”
Such unpleasant contradictions are beside the point , as far as the White House is concerned .
Its aim in promoting the anticommunist statue was to invoke the Cold War as a precedent for what is being presented to the American people as a “ global war on terrorism , ” a supposedly inevitable and “ generational ” struggle that will see the US occupying Iraq and waging war elsewhere for many decades to come .
It was left to a Democrat to spell out this aim most directly ... and crudely .
Representative Tom Lantos of California , the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , was brought on to the platform for the opening speech , which quickly turned into a tirade not only against Iran and Islam , but also against various European leaders .
Comparing what he termed “ distorted Islamic fascism ” to “ godless communism , ” Lantos said that NATO must be rebuilt “ as the military arm of the civilized world and see to it that no Nazism , no communism , no Ahmadinejad - ism [ referring to the Iranian president ] , will prevail on this planet . ”
He went further , denouncing the former leaders of both Germany and France for failing to support the illegal US invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
His harshest words were reserved for former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , whom he termed a “ political prostitute ” for “ taking big checks from [ Russian President Vladimir ] Putin . ”
After leaving office in 2005 , Schröder took a position as chairman of the North European Gas Pipeline , which is 51 percent owned by Russian state natural gas company Gazprom .
As for former French President Jacques Chirac , Lantos said he “ should go down to the Normandy beaches .
He should see those endless rows of white marble crosses and stars of David representing young Americans who gave their lives for the freedom of France . ”
“ I am so glad that the era of Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Schröder in Germany is now gone , ” Lantos said to applause from the right - wing audience .
Lantos , a Holocaust survivor , who fled his native Hungary for the US in 1956 , said he had fought Nazism and communism , and “ it is now my privilege to fight against Islamic terrorism determined to take us back 13 centuries . ”
How is one to explain the gratuitous swipes at Schröder , Chirac and Putin and the thinly veiled appeal for military action against Iran at a ceremony supposedly called to honor the memory of the “ victims of communism ” ?
The tirade from the California Democrat helped place this strange little political episode in perspective .
Behind all of the rhetoric about a supposedly endless struggle between “ totalitarian evil ” and “ freedom , ” ideologues in both major US parties are attempting to mythologize the Cold War in order to better promote an agenda of global US militarism .
In the final analysis , US imperialism waged the Cold War for the same reason it is now pursuing its “ global war on terror ” : to pursue US geopolitical and economic interests , further American capitalist hegemony and suppress the threat of social revolution .
The targets of Lantos ’s vitriol — the European powers , Russia and Iran ( China came in for ample attacks from others ) — are those global actors seen as impeding the hegemonic ambitions of US imperialism .
In the end , there was something tawdry and almost pathetic about this statue unveiling , which took place in a largely deserted corner of Washington surrounded by parking lots .
The right - wing ideologues who had promoted it were veterans of the anticommunist crusade of the Reagan administration , who saw the collapse of the USSR as the advent of “ unipolar world ” in which Washington would rule unchallenged .
It was based upon this false perspective that they promoted the policies of “ preemptive war ” that have created such a debacle in Iraq and led to the unprecedented popular opposition to the Bush administration and its war policy .
This attempt to resuscitate anticommunism , which for decades served as what amounted to an official state ideology in the US , in order to rescue the discredited occupation of Iraq and “ global war on terrorism , ” is a measure of the growing desperation and disorientation of the American ruling elite .
BAGHDAD / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki reacted sharply on Wednesday to U.S. criticism of his government ’s slow progress toward reconciliation , and U.S. President George W. Bush restated his support for Maliki after earlier lukewarm comments .
Bush also drew a comparison with the U.S. experience in Vietnam as he urged perseverance in the unpopular Iraq war .
He cited the example of the emergence of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and violence in Vietnam after U.S. troops pulled out to warn of the consequences of leaving Iraq .
The comparison with Vietnam is one the Bush administration has tended to avoid .
Many Democrats have likened Iraq to Vietnam , calling the war a quagmire that has exacted a toll in American lives and money without furthering U.S. interests .
U.S. officials have voiced increasing frustration this week with Maliki ’s failure to advance political reform despite an increase in the number of U.S. troops , which is intended to give breathing room to his fractured Shi’ite - led coalition .
On Wednesday , Hillary Clinton , the leading Democratic candidate in the 2008 presidential race , joined another Democratic senator ’s call for Maliki to be replaced .
Even Bush , speaking to reporters in Canada on Tuesday , noted “ a certain level of frustration with the leadership ” and failed to offer a direct endorsement of Maliki .
Earlier on Tuesday , U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker said the Maliki government ’s progress toward reconciliation was “ extremely disappointing . ”
Maliki hit back during a visit to Damascus , saying no one outside Iraq had the right to set timetables for progress .
On Wednesday , Bush said in a speech to U.S. war veterans in Kansas City , Missouri : “ Prime Minister Maliki is a good guy , a good man , with a difficult job and I support him . ”
As the diplomatic heat rose , there was more violence in Iraq .
A suicide bomber killed 25 people , including 15 policemen , and wounded 73 in an attack on a police headquarters in Baiji .
Fourteen U.S. soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash in northern Iraq blamed on mechanical failure , the worst incident of its kind since January 2005 .
Bush ’s Republican administration is pushing for Iraq ’s warring Shi’ite Muslim majority and minority Sunni Muslim Arabs to reconcile so it can start bringing troops home from an unpopular war .
Crocker and the top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , are due to deliver a progress report next month that could signal a change in U.S. policy in Iraq .
Maliki ’s response to the criticism was blunt .
“ The Iraqi government was elected by the Iraqi people , ” he told reporters in the Syrian capital .
“ Maybe this person who made a statement yesterday is upset by the nature of our visit to Syria , ” Maliki said , without making clear if he was referring to Bush or Crocker .
“ These statements do not concern us a lot , ” Maliki said .
“ We will find many around the world who will support us in our endeavor . ”

‘ IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLE ’
In his Kansas City speech , Bush said the war in Iraq , like World War Two , the Korean War and the Vietnam War , was an “ ideological struggle , ” and he again depicted the conflict as part of the broader U.S. war on terrorism .
“ The militarists of Japan and the communists in Korea and Vietnam were driven by a merciless vision for the proper ordering of humanity , ” Bush said .

“ Like our enemies in the past , the terrorists who wage war in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places seek to spread a political vision of their own : a harsh plan for life that crushes freedom , tolerance and dissent , ” he added .
The U.S. military has launched a nationwide offensive targeting Sunni Islamist al Qaeda fighters and Shi’ite militias to thwart an expected increase in attacks ahead of the report to Congress , expected on September 11 or 12 .
Washington has set a series of benchmarks for Maliki ’s government , including a revenue - sharing oil law , which it sees as key to ending the sectarian conflict that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis .
Reporting the helicopter crash , a U.S. military statement said initial indications suggested the Black Hawk , one of two involved in night operations , had suffered mechanical failure .
It was the second incident of its kind in eight days .
“ There were no indications of hostile fire , ” it said .
“ That helicopter had been carrying four crew members and 10 passengers . ”
The exact location of the crash was not immediately clear .
The deaths took to 3,721 the number of U.S. military killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein , including 63 this month .
Good Haskell Style
Introduction
There is a common misconception that the purpose of writing Haskell programs is to instruct a machine to perform certain computations , and to report the results thereof .
This myth is perpetrated by numerous lecture courses , books , websites and other media , which merely teach how to write programs with the desired functionality .
In actual fact , to write a good Haskell program is to create a work of art .
As such , any Haskell program worth writing must be beautiful .
In fact , rumour has it that the GHC optimiser analyses programs it is asked to compile and , if it finds it aesthetically pleasing , will work harder to make your program run faster .
But what determines whether a Haskell program is beautiful or not ?
Read on , my intrepid friend , and you shall find out !
Notation
Not to give too many clues away as to what is coming up , but let 's start off with a little notation .
Haskell code will be written thus :
f = map g g = id
As spaces , tabs are invisible , where we need to talk about them we will shade them thus :
space = ' ' tab = ' '
Unless otherwise stated , tabs will continue to the next column that is a multiple of 8 , as required by the Haskell report .
Trailing white space
Let 's warm up with a nice easy one : trailing white space .
Quite simple really : trailing white space is ugly .
Just to make it concrete , this is bad :
f x = let y = x in y
and this is good :
f x = let y = x in y
Our favourite revision crontrol system can help keep us on the straight an narrow here ; if you try to record the bad example above then it will prompt you with
hunk ./ foo.hs 1 +f x = $ + let y = x ^ I$ + in y
clearly highlighting the trailing white space .
Tabs
Now we 're nicely warmed up it 's time to turn the heat up some more , with one of the more contentious issues : tabs .
Haskell defines tabs to align to the next column that is divisible by 8 characters - informally refered to as " 8 space tabs " .
It is this definition that is used by the layout rule .
However , many people configure their editors with 2 or 4 space tabs .
This means that when editing nested - block , such as C :
int main ( void ) { if ( 1 ) { while ( 1 ) { ...
the code is less likely to be wider than the editor .
Before we begin , it is worth taking a look at what happens when no policy is agreed upon .
Here are two excerpts from some real code ; the first is from the GHC sources , while the second is from the base package :
let dflags1 = dflags0 { ghcMode = mode , hscTarget = lang , -- leave out hscOutName for now hscOutName = panic " Main.main:hscOutName not set " , verbosity = case cli_mode of DoEval _ -> 0 _other -> 1 }
if eol then do if ( w == off + 1 ) then writeIORef ref buf{ bufRPtr=0 , bufWPtr=0 } else writeIORef ref buf{ bufRPtr = off + 1 } return ( concat ( reverse ( xs:xss ) ) ) else do
I think we can agree that these examples are ugly , and there are many more like them to be found .
As we will see , this undisciplined style of indentation causes other problems as well .
Some people have claimed that a benefit of tabs is as a primitive form of compression .
While this is undeniably true , we believe that this is a minor benefit given the size of source code and today 's abundance of disk space .
But what disadvantage is there of treating tabs merely as white space compression ?
Consider this function definition :
f x = case x of Just y -> case y of Just z -> z
If people read the code with tabs configured as Haskell dictates , then of course they will see the correct definition you wrote .
However , suppose the reader has his editor configured to show 2 space tabs ; then they will see :
f x = case x of Just y -> case y of Just z -> z
which no longer looks like a syntactically valid program !
Let us say that this program is tab - significant , i.e. the width of a tab can change the meaning of the program , while the earlier C program example was tab - insignificant .
Then it is possible to use tabs in Haskell code and stil write tab - insignificant Haskell programs , it is just either non-trivial or constrains your code layout .
Let us now look at each in turn .
First the non-trivial way .
Consider this program :
f x = case x of Left y -> let z =
Right y in case y of True -> print z
Here we use tabs to indent the blocks of code which the layout rule will be creating .
Let us look at the last line of the program .
We must first use 6 spaces to indent to the level of the outer case expression , and then a tab to enter the block started by the case .
A further 13 spaces take us to the level of the inner case , and a second tab finally gets us into the block that this case starts .
However , while this is correct , it is not easy to do by hand , nor is it easy to instruct an editor to do it for you automatically .
Thus we do n't wish to require people stick to this style .
Now let us consider the constraining style .
Here , each time we start a new block we also start a new line , and indent with one more tab than previously .
Here is the same example rewritten in this style :
f x = case x of Left y -> let z =
Right y in case y of True -> print z
As you can see , there are also a couple of tweaks needed to make this style work correctly , such as indenting " in " by a space .
It can be made to work , though , and is simple .
So what is wrong with it ?
Unfortunately , it constrains you to a code layout that we believe is ugly .
So , we have eliminated both options ; what is left ?
Simple : Do not use tabs .
At all .
Now all programs look identical everywhere , and everyone is happy , regardless of their editor settings !
From simplicity comes beauty .
Line length
Resolving the tabs question in favour of " no tabs " means that the question of how long a line should be becomes a valid one to ask .
For better or for worse , the nearest thing we have to a standard editor width is 80 columns .
Therefore we should strive to keep lines to at most 79 columns .
Sometimes the extra ugliness necessary to contort the code to this restriction will be worse than just letting a line or two wrap , but it 's a good target .
CamelCase versus underscores
Another bone of contention between Haskellers is whether to go for CamelCase , e.g. myVariableName , or underscores , e.g. my_variable_name .
We advise the use of CamelCase for two reasons .
First , the report and standard libraries use it , so it helps keep Haskell code consistent .
Second , we have just decided on a maximum line length , and the extra character or two saved in an identifier or two can make the difference between a line that simply does not fit nicely in 79 columns , and one that makes it look effortless .
Layout
While the Haskell syntax is defined with braces and semicolons , similar to lesser , more traditional , languages , we are also able to omit the braces and semicolons and have them infered by the parser .
But which is the better style ?
Some people argue that the use of explicit braces and semicolons makes code easier to understand , particularly for those new to the language .
For example , in
f x = case x of { Just y -> case y of { Just z -> z ; Nothing -> 1 } } ; Nothing -> 0 }
the structure of the program is clearly defined by the braces and semicolons .
Unfortunately , after a few bug fixes , it is all too easy to end up with code that looks more like this :
f x = case x of { Just y -> case y of { Just z -> z ; Nothing -> 1 } } ; Nothing -> 0 }
By following the braces and semicolons it is still possible to see the program structure , but it is now obscured by poor layout .
By contrast , if we write the program with implicit layout , thus :
f x = case x of Just y -> case y of Just z -> z Nothing -> 1 Nothing -> 0
then our Haskell implementations will make sure that we keep it vaguely readable , by giving a parse error if we break any of its rules .
Note also that omiting the punctuation gives smaller , cleaner - looking code .
Thus we recommend that you use implicit layout .
Conclusion
And that concludes our journey .
To summarise , then :
Do n't leave trailing white space in your code
Do n't use tabs
Aim to keep lines under 80 characters
Use the CamelCase variable naming convention
Do n't use explicit braces and semicolons
In order to help you on your quest to write beautiful programs , we have some tips on how you can get vim to assist you .
I look forward to admiring your artistic creations in the future !
General Motors Giving Payola To Radio Talk Shot Hosts
Ralph Nader writes in a recent column that General Motors has a huge payola deal going with talk show hosts across the political spectrum .
GM gives the hosts new cars two weeks each month and brings them to Detroit for meetings with company executives .
Those signed up for the deal include Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly , and Laura Schlessinger , but also Bill Press and Ed Schultz .
Much of Nader 's column is based on a story in Automotive News , which has a lot of damning detail which Nader did n't include .
It 's subscription only , but I 've liberated it from the Automotive News website in the public interest , below .

General Motors Payola
GM woos the radio stars
Rush , Whoopi and others plug vehicles on the air
By Mary Connelly
( Detroit ) General Motors is recruiting many of America 's best known radio personalities - including Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly , Laura Schlessinger and Whoopi Goldberg - to talk up its vehicles on the air .
GM says it does n't pay the stars directly for their endorsements , although it advertises on their shows .
It gives them new GM cars and trucks to drive for two weeks each month .
The company also invites the celebrities to Detroit for private meetings with top executives and VIP tours of GM facilities .
The attention is paying off .
One day last month , for example , Limbaugh - who has the largest audience in talk radio - told his listeners that " GM cars and trucks have never been better .
" GM has a ton of momentum , '' Limbaugh enthused .
" They are working hard and they are thinking smart .
Believe in General Motors , folks .
They 're a classic American company doing it all . ''
A Dallas disc jockey named Atom Smasher told his listeners : " I am driving around in this Cadillac , and I am not going to want to give it back - the Cadillac SRX .
Named best luxury SUV three years in a row .
And do they look good blinged - out .
To all of the guys at GM : Good job . ''
Said another Dallas DJ , Chris Ryan : " Have you seen all the cool things that 's going on at GM ?
I have .
If you 're thinking about a new car , you got to look to GM . ''
' Emotional connection '
Sam Mancuso , GM 's director of brand marketing alliances and operations , said the company initiated contacts this spring with 17 national radio hosts , as well as dozens of local personalities in cities such as Dallas and Los Angeles .
Mancuso said he and Betsy Lazar , GM executive director of advertising and media operations , have done much of the wooing .
" Radio personalities have unique relationships with their listeners , '' Mancuso told Automotive News .
" They make a real emotional connection .
The audience knows they are being genuine .
" We said , ' Let 's provide them with information about the vehicles and let them engage and discuss . '
And that is what they are doing .
When they come out here and get to meet with us , their eyes open wide .
They are so excited about the product . ''
GM 's monitoring confirms that the personalities are talking about the company 's vehicles on their programs , Mancuso said .
But he insisted that GM does not give any of them a script .
" They are not required to mention GM , '' he said .
" Do they mention the product ?
Yes .
Do they mention GM ?
Some yes , some no . ''
Limbaugh and both Dallas radio hosts said in their spiels that GM has " 24 models that get an EPA - estimated 30 miles per gallon or more on the highway . ''
They used the words " more than any other manufacturer . ''
And they all cited E85 flex - fuel vehicles and the Saturn Aura Green Line in discussing GM 's environmental initiatives .
Mancuso would not say how much GM spends to advertise on the hosts ' radio shows .
Limbaugh visited GM headquarters in early May , Mancuso said .
He met with Vice Chairman Bob Lutz and design chief Ed Welburn and toured the company 's design center .
Right and left
Mancuso said the radio hosts whom GM works with fall along a broad spectrum of political opinions .
The list includes conservative commentators such as Limbaugh , O'Reilly , Schlessinger , Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck .
But it also includes liberals such as Bill Press and Ed Schultz .
Other personalities , such as Goldberg , Ryan Seacrest and John Tesh , host essentially apolitical entertainment and music - oriented programs .
Jim Rome hosts a daily sports talk show .
Other local and national personalities host shows aimed at black and Hispanic audiences .
" There is no political agenda here , '' Mancuso said .
" We do n't associate ourselves with what ( the hosts ' ) beliefs are . ''
Several of the celebrities appear on TV as well as radio .
O'Reilly and Hannity host nightly programs on Fox News Channel .
Beck is a host on CNN Headline News and contributes to ABC's " Good Morning America . ''
Seacrest hosts
Fox 's " American Idol ' ' - which is sponsored by Ford Motor Co .
While the personalities may also discuss their GM experiences on TV , Mancuso said , the company is " not involved in that . ''

By nature or personal choice , they are rich and famous and yet … ugly as hell !
1 Michael Jackson
Did you really expect anyone else ?
Michael Jackson used to be a successful black singer , but took it upon himself to destroy his face and reputation .
He now looks like an albino alien whose nose appears to change on a daily basis .
Just goes to show you what can happen if you are too critical of your looks … you can end up an albino alien like Mike .
2 Marilyn Manson
Seriously … what the hell happened to this kid ?
From the ghostly white makeup you can see on his black collar to the funky blue eye and blood red lips … Marilyn Manson is a freak and there ’s nothing more to say , he ’s ugly by choice .
And not only is he ugly , but he scares the crap out of us .
3 Jocelyn Wildenstein
Holy crap !
This is what happens when you get obsessed with plastic surgery .
A wealthy socialite from Switzerland , Jocelyn is actually a celeb for being so ugly .
Her extreme appearance has led to the press giving her the nickname “ The Bride of Wildenstein , ” a reference to The Bride of Frankenstein .
Wildenstein has allegedly spent almost US $ 4,000,000 on cosmetic surgery over the years , all payed by her husband , the billionaire international art dealer Alec Wildenstein .
4 Michael Berryman
No , it is not make - up .
This actor born in LA , suffers from Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia ( a rare condition leaving him with no sweat glands , hair , fingernails or teeth ) .
He played Pluto in Wes Craven ’s 1977 horror film The Hills Have Eyes .
He has also appeared in numerous science fiction and fantasy movies such as My Science Project ( 1985 ) , Weird Science ( 1985 ) , Armed Response ( 1986 ) and Evil Spirits ( 1990 ) .
He also appeared in One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest , and The Devil ’s Rejects .
Berryman generally portrays mutant bikers , evil undertakers , monsters and other frightening characters .
He has also starred in episodes of Star Trek : The Next Generation and The X - Files .
5 DJ Qualls
Ok , we are going to be really mean again , since he ’s actually ugly for a another terrible reason .
We ’re actually happy to see he has turned it into a good thing , just like Berryman .
Qualls also suffered from a rare condition : Hodgkin ’s lymphoma , a form of cancer , at age 14 .
After two years of surgery ( including the removal of his spleen ) , chemotherapy , and radiation treatments , Qualls ’s cancer went into remission , which lent him his famous thin stature .
In 1997 , he enrolled at Nashville ’s Belmont University .
At a performance in a local theatre he was discovered by David LaChapelle and became … a model !!
Yes , a model , for Prada and Calvin Klein .
He then got famous for his role on the movie “ Road Trip ” .
6 Marty Feldman
And yet another terrible case .
Marty Feldman ( 1934 – 1982 ) was an English writer , comedian and BAFTA award winning actor , notable for his bulging eyes , which were the result of a thyroid condition known as Graves Disease .
He wrote situation comedies such as The Army Game , Bootsie and Snudge for the BBC and later had a series of his own on the BBC called Marty .
He also appeared in The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes ’ Smarter Brother and Mel Brooks ’ Silent Movie , as well as directing and starring in The Last Remake of Beau Geste .
He guest - starred in the “ Arabian Nights ” episode of The Muppet Show .
7 Clint Howard
No weird disease this time — he ’s just plain ugly .
But then , again , it is probably what made him famous .
Born in 1959 , the actor appeared in Cocoon , Steve Martin ’s Parenthood , EdTV , Apollo 13 , Austin Powers , That Thing You Do among others .
In 1998 , Howard was awarded the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award .
He got married twice , just to show you that looks do n’t matter .
8 Shane MacGowan
This Irish musician is best known as the original singer and songwriter with The Pogues , and is considered one of the most important and poetic Irish songwriters of the last thirty years .
A great find for our list … he ’s terribly horrible .
9 Lyle Lovett
Lyle Lovett has to have some good blackmail on someone .
Otherwise , how in the hell did he ever get into acting ?
And the fact that Julia Roberts married this beast makes us think she ’s not only nuts , but ugly too .
Tell us one thing that you find attractive about this man … go on .
Then we ’ll laugh at you .
10 Kelis
Holy hell … Kelis is not bringin’ any boys to the yard looking like that .
There have been rumors that she is really a man , and quite frankly we are thinking something ’s not right with this chick .
Every time we see her she has her mouth open and looks like she ’s ready to eat us .
She ’s scary .
Next time we see her , we are looking for the Adam ’s apple .
11 Iggy Pop
Rock singer , songwriter , and occasional actor , he is sometimes referred to by the nicknames “ the Godfather of Punk ” .
Iggy Pop was the lead singer of The Stooges , a late 1960s / early 1970s garage rock band who were influential in the development of the nascent heavy metal and punk rock genres .
The Stooges became infamous for their live performances , during which it was not uncommon for Iggy Pop to leap off the stage ( in fact , he was among the first to “ stage dive ” ) , smear raw meat ( and on one occasion peanut butter ) over his chest and / or cut himself with broken bottles .
So this is how you get ugly by being nut .
12 Steven Tyler
Dude looks like a zombie .
He ’s a great singer , a cool guy , the daddy of one of the hottest girls on hollywood , plus all the money and women one could ever dream of … and yet … ugly as hell .
13 Courtney Love
Drugs do n’t make people pretty … and this woman is about as ugly and classless as it can get .
14 Donatella Versace
Oh , how the years go by .
Yes , she ’s talented , famous and rich , but … she ’s now ugly as hell !
15 Amy Winehouse
English soul , jazz , and R&B singer and songwriter , she ’s another drug victim .
Now , get this : she has a number of “ old school ” tattoos of naked women on her body .
When asked about them , she was quoted as saying “ I like pin-up girls .
I ’m more of a boy than a girl in that way .
I ’m not a lesbian , though — not before a sambuca anyway .
And the she said she would own a beauty salon once her singing schedule calms down … that ’s a must .
16 Ronaldinho
Probably the world ’s best soccer player at this time , Ronaldinho might be one of the funniest , honest , and nicest celebs around … but he ’s also one of the ugliest .
This brazilian is certainly saving his huge salary for something other than helping his image .
17 Kelly Osbourne
“ Uh , I ’m ugly . ” Yeah , we know Kelly .
The British accent is cute and we love that she is all about being an individual , but quite frankly Kelly Osbourne ’s annoying and a brat .
And we ’re not picking on her weight , because it fluctuates and we do n’t care .
Weight really can’t change whether you are ugly or not .
And Kelly is on our list !
18 Tori Spelling
Tori Spelling must be thanking her daddy for helping her get into the acting business ’ cause there is no other way she would EVER have made it .
Thanks Aaron Spelling for ruining our lives !
Sometimes you hope someone will grow on you after awhile , but even now when we see Tori on TV we immediately switch the channel .
Yeah , it ’s that bad .
And do n’t even get us started on her acting .
19 Rosie O’Donnell
Rosie O’Donnell is a bully , but it ’s not the bad temper what got her on our list … she ’s ugly , plain and simple .
20 Rachel Dratch
Do n’t get us wrong : we love Rachel .
Her SNL sketches are hilarious , she ’s a great actress .
But we are sorry to say she truly earned the last place on our list .

BY THE narrowest of margins , five votes to four , the Supreme Court on Thursday June 28th ruled against positive discrimination by race in certain American high schools .
The ruling is sure to upset many people , striking down as it does well - meaning attempts by local school districts to ensure that a government - funded school 's racial mix should not deviate too much from the local average .
Critics will also note that this was the fifth case in a week to be decided on the conservative side by the same team of five judges , and will conclude that the Supreme Court under President George Bush 's chosen Chief Justice , John Roberts , has tilted decisively to the right .
That conclusion would be correct , but the panic should not be over - done .
The judgments have mostly been quite narrowly defined , and may not presage any sharper shift : in fact , the truly conservative members of the bench , Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia , were left disappointed rather than thrilled .
Chief Justice Roberts ends his first full legal year in the job with his reputation enhanced for cautious attention to the spirit of the constitution .
That said , the days of creative judicial activism on the side of liberal causes is plainly over .
The schools case concerned two school districts , one in Seattle and the other in Louisville , Kentucky , but the implications could affect similar programmes in hundreds of other districts .
However , the result need not be fatal to attempts to mingle the races .
The cases were brought after the parents of white children excluded from schools by the positive - discrimination policy sued .
All the court has decided is that skin colour should not be used as a basis on which to assign students to one school or another .
That , Mr Roberts argued , is no way to solve the problem of race discrimination .
Across America a variety of other , better , mechanisms for improving schools are being tried .
Many educators would argue that instead of being fixated by race ( in any case intermarriage and the rapid rise in the number of Hispanics make race a difficult thing to define these days ) , it makes more sense to design policies that offset the disadvantages faced by all children from poor or uneducated families , regardless of their colour .
Much better , some districts reckon , to consider other indicators such as the receipt of free school lunches as a proxy for poverty .
Positive discrimination is acceptable , the court is saying , just not on the grounds of skin colour .
The issue is also complicated by the fact that the districts in question are not , anyhow , deemed to suffer from racial segregation that requires correction .
So it was not clear in either case that black children 's rights were being harmed and needed correcting .
The new court 's tilt has also been discerned in a couple of cases concerning free speech , which were decided on June 25th .
In one of them the Roberts court struck down restrictions on some kinds of political advertising brought in by a 2002 law on political campaigns , the McCain - Feingold act .
Although critics have denounced this as giving in to money politics , the court 's ruling arguably reflects the spirit of the constitution more accurately than the 2002 bill does , while being careful to address itself only to the particulars of the case .
The same goes for the second free - speech case , concerning the right of a high - school student to wave a banner reading “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” during a school parade .
The right to free speech , the court concluded , does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline , and nor does it protect the promotion of illegal drugs .
The justices were careful to note that this was only a very limited and exceptional decision .
So far , at least , the court is indeed tilting , but not lurching .
There is so much green being bandied about that it ’s practically impossible for us mere mortals to sort out the true green from the green wash .
Some of the claims are indeed true , some are a pile of hocus pocus , and some are well , good in theory but too bloody bad because of unintended consequences .
So in this , my new series about what ’s green and what ’s not , I am going to attempt to figure out just that .
You and I can then vote green thumbs up , or alternatively , down .
( See the thumb key at the end to see how to rate ) .
In this my inaugural piece , I thought I ’d go straight for the jugular , and tackle that most maligned of issues … carbon credits .
Do they have an objectively positive effect on our atmosphere , or are they – as many claim – only a license to pollute ?
Firstly , let ’s make sure we all get the basic concept , which , if you ’re reading this you probably do .
But just in case , here goes ...
Let ’s say your next door neighbor starts grinding away on his electric guitar at three in the morning .
He ’s not only burning through your patience , but electricity , which usually comes from carbon dioxide - emitting power plants .
Carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) is , of course , one of the primary greenhouse gases making our global thermostat rise .
Your neighbor can now keep you awake with a clear conscience – he can shell out to deal with his guitar ’s pollution .
Here he has two options : he pays to either 1 ) support companies / projects that remove existing CO 2 from the air , or 2 ) buy into a project that theoretically prevents an equivalent amount of CO 2 from going into the air .
That ’s a carbon credit , or offset , or reduction .
His serenade may be contributing to your stress , but not global warming … in theory .
The concept is grand .
For under the cost of one grande cappuccino a week – about $ 100 a year – you can buy enough carbon credits to essentially add no CO 2 to the world ’s atmosphere .
You ’d be ‘ carbon neutral . ’
If every human was carbon neutral there ’d be no more global warming .
This same general principal holds true at the country level too .
Under the United Nations ’s ( U.N. ) Kyoto protocol , if country A is n’t going to make a deadline to reduce its carbon emissions to a given allotment , it can purchase credits from country B , or UN - accredited projects in the developing world .
The concept sounds so brilliant , such a win-win , what ’s all the fuss about ?
The first issue – and perhaps the most confused issue in the retail market in particular – is whether a carbon credit is truly ‘ additional ’ .
That ’s U.N. jargon that basically means “ would the carbon reduction have occurred anyway if the carbon market did n’t exist ? ”
For example , let ’s say our midnight guitarist bought carbon credits that paid farmers to plant a bunch of trees that store carbon in their trunks and soil .
If the farmers were going to plant their trees anyway with or without your annoying neighbor ’s money , then all the fellow has done is give a nice little bonus to the farmers .
His cash has not added at all to the amount of carbon reductions .
The poor bloke ’s carbon credits are not additional and thus entirely bogus .
However , if the farmers were scraping by and could n’t afford to plant those trees until our budding musician came along and paid them , then the resulting carbon credits are additional ( assuming they meet several other criteria , if you use the U.N. guidelines ) .
Now we get to a second rather unfortunate issue , the permanence of the carbon credits / offsets / reductions .
How does our musician know that the farmers will still have his trees in 10 years , 20 years , 40 years ?
A couple of years ago , the band Coldplay paid villagers in India to plant mango trees to sequester the carbon the band emitted during CD production .
The villagers would soon have fruit , and the trees would soak up the CO 2 .
When someone checked on the status of the trees only a couple of years later , many had shriveled and died from lack of care and watering .
Ouch !
This inability to guarantee permanence for some sequestration techniques is why advocates of carbon credits tend to prefer projects that stop CO2 and other greenhouse gases from going into the air in the first place .
The CO 2 prevented from going into the atmosphere by making an old , inefficient coal - fired plant more efficient will forever more not have gone into the air – if you see what I mean .
At the country level , most carbon credits fall under fairly rigorous regulation by the U.N. – except for those in places like the U.S. that do not fall under the Kyoto Protocol and so currently have no laws governing them whatsoever .
For us consumers valiantly trying to do the right thing and offset those emissions that we just ca n’t do anything about ( I ’m sorry , but I am not riding my bicycle to work in over 100 degree weather ) , the world of retail carbon credits is unregulated , and an utterly confusing mess .
Currently there are over thirty online retailers , and they are definitely not made equal .
Some are altogether iffy , making claims that frankly are n’t true .
( Currently , carbon credits based on Renewable Energy Credits are questionable at best because of the inaccuracies of calculating carbon reductions with them .
And do n’t be fooled into thinking that they ’re certified for said use , as some might like you to believe .
A few months ago I called the certifier to confirm , who said it ’s not so . )
Last year , Clean Air Cool Planet wrote a good report that analyzed the sellers and the quality of their products – how they calculate the amount of carbon they claim to offset , whether they include additionality , and a bunch of other metrics .
The report shows that none is perfect , but some do have solid products , that not only reduce CO 2 , but help people too .
Through such groups as Native Energy and Climate Trust you can , for instance , pay a struggling American farmer to plant his fields with windmills .
He can then sell clean electricity to the grid .
Carbon credits represent a horribly complex market , and I ’ve only touched on a couple of the challenges facing those trying to make it work .
I believe that whether carbon credits are useful or not depends on the execution .
One reason I give carbon credits a green thumbs up , even with all the caveats , problems , fraud and other nefarious activities charading as positive actions for our global atmosphere , is the power of historical data .
In the latter half of the 20th century , acid rain was a hideous environmental problem , killing forests and poisoning lakes and streams .
High levels of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide ( NO x and SO 2 ) , mostly emitted by power plants , react with gases in the air to create nitric and sulfuric acid .
These compounds also cause asthma .
Almost 16 million tons of SO2 wafted into the air in 1990 alone .
That same year , Congress amended the Clean Air Act to include a mandatory cap and trade scheme for SO 2 akin to carbon credits , with extraordinary results .
By 1995 , the emissions had dropped by more than 20 % .
By 2002 they were down below 50 % of 1990 levels , and acid rain is pretty much a thing of the past ( Environmental Defense Fund ) .
Would that the carbon market has such an effect on greenhouse gas emissions !
In 2006 , $ 34.5 billion - worth of carbon changed hands worldwide , according to Point Carbon .
Has that resulted in an equivalent amount of CO 2 reduction ?
That would be a resounding no .
Has some of that money prevented CO 2 from going into the air that otherwise would have polluted the skies ?
Yes .
How much is impossible to say .
In the final analysis my P.O.V. is that carbon credits are valuable for fighting greenhouse gas emissions , but that a lot of ground needs to be covered to increase their reliability and relevance .
For instance , in the U.S. they need to be regulated , otherwise just about anyone can make any claims and it ’s practically impossible to substantiate them .
They should be mandatory for major polluters , otherwise they have no teeth .
With the disclaimer to those of us buying retail credits of ' buyers beware ' , I currently give carbon credits one green thumb up .

Bank Cracks Down on Wily Yarn Merchant
This story sounds too weird to be true , and yet I have a feeling it is true .
It concerns knitting .
It seems that knitting has become an increasingly popular hobby among a large slice of middle - and upper - class American women .
We here at Freakonomics are not unfamiliar with this phenomenon : Levitt ’s sister runs Yarnzilla , an online and brick - and - mortar knitting emporium ; and my wife has recently become a knitting zealot enthusiast .
( I am always intrigued that so many people have embraced menial tasks — knitting , cooking , gardening , e.g. — as high - end hobbies , but that is a whole ‘ nother story . )
So when the following e-mail arrived , I read it with interest .
To summarize : a yarn company gets so successful so fast that its bank suspects it is a front for something illegal and shuts down its credit - card operation .
As I said , sounds too weird to be true .
Judge for yourself .
Dear S&S ,
I ’ve gathered from reading the Freakonomics blog that at least one of you lives in New York , so you are no doubt aware that in the last few years knitting has become pretty hip .
The knitting community is large and rich ( Stephanie Pearl - McPhee ’s blog , yarnharlot.ca , raised over $ 120,000 for Tricoteuses Sans Frontiers in less than three days , this Christmas ) , so it ’s surprising that we are still so socially invisible .
Maybe $ 120 K is n’t so much , on the scale of the entertainment industry .
But here ’s the interesting part :
This morning , one of the most popular producers of hand - dyed sock yarn , Blue Moon Fiber Arts , announced that they were making so much money on their sock yarn that their bank managers decided it must be a front for something illegal , and shut down Blue Moon ’s credit card system , and refunded all of the money for the 2007 Sock Club !
Blue Moon has found another bank that is happy to take knitter ’s money , no matter how much of it there is , so all is well again in the knitting world .
It does seem , however , that this gobsmacking development deserves to be known outside the knitting community - and must be of some kind of interest to economists .
The incident has been blogged about by the Yarn Harlot .
And also by one of Blue Moon ’s biggest fan - blogs , January One .
Sincerely ,
Katrina Triezenberg , Ph.D. , sock knitter
President Bush may be a headless horseman .
But the biggest problem is what he rode in on .
Martin Luther King Jr. had a good name for it 40 years ago .
" The madness of militarism . "
We can blame Bush all we want  and he does hold the reins right now  but his main enablers these days are the fastidious public servants in Congress .
They keep preparing the hay , freshening the water , oiling the saddle , even while criticizing the inappropriately jocular rider .
And when the band plays " Hail to the Jockey , " most of the grown - up stable boys and girls ca n’t help saluting .
The people who actually live in Iraq have their own opinions , of course .
UPI reported at the end of December that a new poll , conducted by the Iraq Center for Research and Strategic Studies , found that " about 90 percent of Iraqis feel the situation in the country was better before the U.S. - led invasion than it is today . "
Meanwhile , according to a CNN poll last month , 11 percent of Americans support sending more U.S. troops to Iraq .
Buried in a New York Times news article on Tuesday ( Jan. 9 ) was this statement of fact : " By law , Congress can limit the nature of troop deployments , cap the size of military deployments and cut financing for existing or prospective deployments . "
Some Democrats in Congress want to hand the president his head and some do n’t .
But , as a practical matter , the distinction is moot .
He ’s in the thrall of what you might call a repetition compulsion disorder that manifests as digging in his heels .
Obviously the president likes the wind in his ears .
And he shows no sign of slowing down .
Bush can keep riding the madness of militarism at a gallop unless people on Capitol Hill stop nourishing it with appropriations .
And they wo n’t do that unless we find effective ways to insist that they cut off funding for the war .
The key problem right now is n’t the headless jockey .
It ’s the stable hands who keep feeding the horse he rode in on .
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry has run into another roadblock in its legal battles against suspected file - sharers in Europe .
German prosecutors have begun denying requests to force ISPs to identify the subscribers behind IP addresses , saying that the alleged file - sharing was a " petty offense . "
The most recent ruling came from a court in Offenburg , Germany .
Responding to a request from the German music industry for the names and addresses of users allegedly engaged in file - sharing , the court instructed the public prosecutor 's office not to turn over the data .
According to German - language Heise Online , the court said that the labels did not explain how a " criminally relevant damage " could have arisen from the alleged file - sharing
Under German law , if the IFPI or anyone else wants to get subscriber data from an ISP , it needs to go through the public prosecutor 's office .
Unlike the US — where the RIAA can file a John Doe lawsuit , obtain an ex parte subpoena , and finger the suspected infringer without his or her knowledge of the lawsuit — German law has no provision allowing for civil proceedings to obtain ISP subscriber info .
The Offenburg decision is only the most recent in a string of setbacks for the record labels in Germany , according to Heise Online .
A February complaint made by a law firm that typically handles file - sharing litigation for the music industry in Germany was rejected by the chief public prosecutor 's office in Celle .
In that case , the prosecutor ruled that the law firm could not demonstrate that any " substantial " damages to the record labels occurred .
According to a copy of the letter seen by Heise , the prosecutor 's office also expressed doubts that the labels would pursue a criminal case .
Tracking down suspected file - sharers may soon become more difficult throughout the EU .
In an advisory opinion released shortly after the Offenburg decision , an advocate general for the European Court of Justice ruled that ISPs are not required to disclose subscriber information in civil infringement cases .
In that case , music industry trade group Promusicae had sued Spanish ISP Telefonica after a number of its subscribers had been flagged for file - sharing on KaZaA .
Telefonica had fought Promusicae , arguing that Spanish law only allowed subscriber information to be turned over in the course of criminal investigations , not civil proceedings .
Should the advocate general 's opinion be adopted by the court — which happens about 80 percent of the time — it would make the kind of legal campaign waged against suspected P2P users in the US all but impossible in the EU .

This has been so absurdly trailed it is bound to be a total anticlimax
yes folks its
The long awaited Freakonomics review Part 3 :
Happy New Year to most of my readers .
Time to crack on with the Freakonomics review , which I actually wrote last year , but wanted to hold back until I 'd finished the whole thing ( yes I know , touching is n't it ? ) .
Thanks to Radek for giving me the heads up on this review , which makes a number of good points .
The remaining parts are tentatively entitled " Freakiology " , on the subject of Levitt & Dubner 's in my opinion very sketchy treatment of important issues of sociology , and " How Freaked is Economics ? " , on what the success of Freakonomics as a popular book , and the success of Levitt as an academic economist , say about the current state of the science of economics .
This bit rounds off the statistical and methodological critique .
It is entitled ...
Natural experiments ai n't so Freaking Natural
This section of the Freakonomics review deals with my problems with the underlying econometric methodology of Freakonomics ( or more specifically , with themes in the career of Steven Levitt which are summarised in the book ) .
It expands on this post from a year ago , in which I got rather alarmed at Levitt 's reaction to being criticised in a working paper on his abortion & crime model .
I need to start with a big caveat ; if you 're criticising someone 's statistics , it is easy to get into the realm of the unprofessional and / or defamatory .
Nothing I say below should be taken as accusing Levitt or any of his coauthors of intentionally misrepresenting anything .
In particular , references to " data - mining " refer to what I regard as a deformation of the general field econometric methodology rather than to anything purposeful or specific to Levitt .
So here we go .
Levitt 's reputation in economics rests on micro-economic empirical work rather than theory .
Empirical microeconomics is in general a rather hairy mathematical field ; unlike empirical macroeconomics , when you are generally dealing with a relatively small number of well - known and consistently collected aggregate time series , microeconomic datasets tend to be idiosyncratic , problem - specific , collected in ways which might be considered to introduce bias , qualitative ( ie , yes / no ) rather than quantitative and statistically hairy in all sorts of other ways .
This is why microeconometricians tend to be much stronger on nonlinear methods than macroeconometricians ( although generally weaker on time series modelling ) and generally more familiar with the dusty end of the STATA instruction manual .
Very few macro models are particularly complicated from a mathematical standpoint ; they are often big , which makes them complicated in a different way , and in general a lot of thought has to go in to the process of deciding what variables to include and exclude , but the actual statistical guts of the thing is normally a linear regression – probably one that is estimated by maximum likelihood because of the time series issues , but basically a model where the output is a linear function of the input , with parameters chosen to minimise squared error .
Microeconometric models are much gnarlier , almost always estimated by ML ( or these days , as often as not , by Bayesian methods which allow for even more complicated functional forms ) , with structures that are highly non-linear .
On the other hand , my assessment of microeconometric modelling is that they do n't spend anything like as much time and effort on the modelling issues ( as opposed to estimation issues ) as the macro guys , and they might be surprised what they found if they did .
Levitt , on the other hand , does a lot of microeconometrics , but he is not a good econometrician ( as he freely admits ) .
How does he manage it ?
Well , partly by having good co-authors ( I will return to this issue in part 5 ) .
But partly by making very extensive use indeed of the instrumental variables approach .
As part of my " mission to explain " , I should probably now explain what the IV approach is and why anyone might be interested in it .
OK here goes then .
Imagine you are the chancellor of Oxford University , trying to find out whether rugby players are thicker than rowers [ 1 ] .
You might want to carry out a regression analysis of the form :
Alpha ( % of rugby players ) + Beta ( % of rowers ) = Average Finals mark .+/- an error term
, across the colleges , and have a look at the coefficients on rugby and rowing .
However , the dean of your medical school points out to you that this regression wo n't work .
The variation across the finals marks of different colleges is also affected by the amount of beer the students drink .
Rugby players drink more beer than the average student , so colleges with a high proportion of rugby players will have lower marks than average , not because rugby players are morons , but because they are also boorish drunks .
Also , because you 're not on speaking terms with any of the bursars , you can't get any college - level data for beer consumption .
Hmmm .
Inspiration strikes .
You realise that Welsh students are more likely to be rugby players than the average student , but no more likely than the average student to be a drunk .
Furthermore , from a previous year 's study you have data on the number of closeted gay men in each college , and it too is well - correlated with the proportion of rugby players .
Bingo zingo , it turns out that the college - level data on purchases of annoying novelty hats also correlates well with the rugby players , while the readership of the Financial Times correlates strongly and negatively .
So you can estimate a preliminary regression thus :
Rho ( % of Welsh ) +
Tau ( % closet gays ) +
Theta ( novelty hats ) + Mu ( FT readers ) = % Rugby players +/- an error term .
Call the left hand side of this equation Gamma .
Gamma is a pretty good estimate of the number of rugby players , and ( because Welshness , closeted gayness , novelty hat purchase and FT readership are none of them correlated with beer drinking ) , unlike the raw data for the number of rugby players , it is n't correlated with the variance in the error term for finals marks .
You can therefore substitute Gamma for the % of rugby players in the first equation , and your estimates will now be consistent , because you 've got rid of the confounding factor of beer consumption .
Gamma is an " instrument " for the number of rugby players , and the version of your regression equation which substitutes Gamma for the percentage of rugby players is the " instrumental variable " estimate of the relationship between rugby , rowing and finals marks .
That 's IV estimation [ 2 ] .
Levitt does a hell of a lot of it .
As long as the left hand variables of your preliminary regression are n't themselves correlated with the variance in the original equation ( in other words , as long as Welshness is n't itself correlated with drunkenness ) , and as long as the fit of the equation estimating Gamma is reasonably good , it will be OK .
( You can actually make do even with a really bad fit in the Gamma equation if you have loads and loads of data [ 3 ] , but usually you do n't ) .
It 's a good method of estimating these models , so why does n't everybody do it ?
Well , in the real world ( a place I have often visited ) , you are n't allowed to randomly pluck series out of the air and say that they are strongly correlated with the variable you want them to be instruments for .
If it turns out that they are weakly correlated , then you are in hell .
The reason for this is that , although we said that Gamma was " uncorrelated " with the error term in the finals marks equation , in any real ( finite ) dataset the measured correlation is likely to be a small number close to zero rather than the actual number zero .
This matters like hell because :
1 ) the bias introduced by this small empirical correlation gets " scaled up " by the reciprocal of the covariance between the instrument and its target variable ( this is now technical as hell , but here 's the best discussion I can find ) .
The idea here is that you are trying to explain the ( signal + noise ) in finals marks with ( signal + noise ) in the instrument .
If there is only a small correlation between the two signals , then there had better be no correlation at all between the two noise terms , or you are just fitting noise to noise and your overall signal / noise ratio will go through the floor .
2 ) in finite samples , the sampling distribution of the IV estimate is the ratio of two normally distributed variables .
The ratio of two normals is a surprisingly complicated distribution ; basically , if it is important to you to estimate something which is the ratio of two normals , then you had better hope that the correlation between them is pretty high because as it goes to zero the ratio of two normals becomes a Cauchy distribution , which is in statistical terms " a really awkward bastard to deal with " [ 4 ] .
Do you see why this took so bloody long to write , by the way ?
So the take - away here is that weak instruments in IV estimation are really bad news , much much worse than poorly correlated regressors in normal regression analysis .
It can actually be better from a mean - squared error point of view to just ignore the bias and do the ordinary regression , if the only instruments you can find are weak .
This is important .
In general , in those of Levitt 's published papers that I 've read , there really is not very much discussion of the strength of the instruments .
There is also a hell of a tendency to say that " there is no reason to believe that this is correlated " , with a bit of a lacuna where the bit ought to be where you check that it is actually uncorrelated , or to have a look at how any small correlation might get inflated by a weakish instrument .
What was that Malcolm Gladwell quote again ?
Steve Levitt has the most interesting mind in America , and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out .
Yup , always with the waving of the fingers .
We should have got suspicious the moment that anyone told us that econometrics could be fun .
In fact , as with all statistical work , the ratio of inspiration and creativity to meaningless grind is so low that it is scarcely possible to reject the null hypothesis of no fun at all .
In fairness , a lot of the work that made Levitt famous predates a lot of the weak instruments literature - it is only comparatively recently that it has even become standard practice to report the results of the first - stage regressions so that everyone can make their own mind up about the strength of the instrument .
And Levitt is actually quite good by the standards of econometricians when it comes to doing crosschecks and similar non -data - driven tests of whether the model is working or not , which is really the only " solution " to a weak instruments problem at present ( people keep working on statistical refinements and there are a few goodish rules of thumb , but basically weak instruments is an unsolved problem of estimation theory ) .
So it 's not that this is an awful thing about Levitt ; the point I want to make here is that the idea that creativity and flair can substitute for the hard yards in econometrics sounds like a free lunch and it probably is .
On the other hand , however , in most cases , it looks to me as if Levitt is using quite strong instruments ( the seminal abortion ' n ' crime paper is an exception though ; without doing the work , it looks to me as if the crack epidemic in the data takes nearly all the strength out of the instrument Levitt & Donohue were using ) .
I did n't really want to write this piece about weakness of instruments .
The real critique I have is based on the way the instruments get found .
Levitt is a hell of a one for " natural experiments " .
A " natural experiment " is a subspecies of instrumental variable estimation , taking advantage of some natural or otherwise exogenous variation to create a situation where some units get assigned to a treatment group and some get assigned to a control group , by chance rather than design .
The stereotypic textbook example is one where you want to investigate whether military service creates human capital ( whether ex-soldiers do better in civilian life than non ex-soldiers ) , but you think that there might be some unobserved characteristics ( like self - discipline or bravery ) which affect both the decision to sign up , and later success .
So what you do is take the cohort of men born in the early 1950s , and use their draft number as an instrument .
Natural experiments are another of those " why does n't everyone do econometrics this way ?!?!? " areas .
The answer is twofold .
The first part of the answer is that natural experiments are really quite hard to find .
Things like the Vietnam draft do n't really come along with anything like the frequency at which econometric problems arrive which look like they'd be amenable to an econometric approach .
Levitt 's big thing , the one that won him the John Bates Clark and the fawning adulation of millions of groupies Steven Dubner , is being really creative and unconventional in the selection of quirky things which can be used as natural experiments .
This is the whole selling point of Freakonomics - it 's all about this sort of lateral thinking and " making you see the world in a whole new light " .
Which brings me to the second part of the answer which is , unfortunately , that since the success of Freakonomics , every bugger does use natural experiments , all the time .
Levitt 's book is Edward de Bono for the green eyeshades set .
I am wholly suspicious of this outpouring of creativity on the part of economists , rather as I would suspect and fear a sudden outbreak of interest in stochastic calculus among teachers of modern dance .
The problem is that the upsurge in economists finding natural experiments is not a result of there being more natural experiments to find , but a result of economists deeming more things to be acceptable natural experiments .
This is worrisome , from a statistical point of view , and it is here that the discussion of " data mining " shall begin , so I redirect your attention to the disclaimer above in which I make it clear that I use the phrase in a sense which is pejorative from a methodological point of view but not personally
The trouble is that there are two ways in which you can go about discovering a natural experiment if you do n't have an obvious one to hand .
You can either be more assiduous in searching for them , or you can lower your standards as to what constitutes a decent natural test of your thesis .
Of these two , oddly enough , I regard the second as much less potentially harmful .
It just gives us a social phenomenon whereby not a robin can fall without some lazy graduate student or junior faculty member using its passing as a " natural experiment " on the market for bird seed .
It tends to mean that crap papers proliferate in the journals ( in general , purporting to prove propositions that nobody was ever disposed to doubt , using econometric techniques so bad as to make you doubt it after all ) , but it is hard to get worked up about this on opportunity cost grounds , as the authors of these papers would be churning out crap of some kind or another anyway .
The first phenomenon , however , is more subtly pernicious .
Choosing natural experiments is a form of data - mining .
Since all sorts of things are happening all the time , if you are prepared to get really creative about it , and prepared to put up with weakish instruments in an IV estimate , you are often able to find all sorts of natural experiments for propositions of interest if you look hard enough .
Specifically , you will as likely as not be able to find one which gives you the result you are looking for .
I direct readers now to my discussion of data mining and stepwise regression from a couple of years ago .
And to this stupid joke from roughly the same period , in order to point out that the decline in quality of this blog since then is largely illusory .
The point I want to make is that the natural experiment version of data - mining causes just the same problems as stepwise regression .
Recall that in the case of stepwise regression , it became impossible to interpret the normal tests of statistical significance , because the critical values of the test statistics assumed that the underlying process was a random one .
And the process which generated the test statistics was n't a random one , because it had been specifically set up to iterate through combinations of regressors until a model was found with the " right " result .
I think something exactly similar could be at work in the natural experiments literature .
We just do n't know how many potential " natural experiments " were looked at and did n't work out , and why .
In many ways , we 're even worse off than we were in the stepwise regression case , because there is at least a sensible mathematical way of getting an idea of the size and shape of the space of possible regression models that a data - miner has iterated over , and constructing an algorithm like PcGets in order to do so in as sensible a manner as possible .
There is no such objective way of dealing with the potential space of natural experiments .
I note here that , as with the stepwise case , the point has to be made that simply trusting in the honesty of our econometricians is n't going to do any good .
As I pointed out back then , the double blind criterion is not used in medical tests in order to protect us from dishonest experimenters .
It 's there to protect us from unconscious bias , wishful thinking and the temptation to find rationalisations for a course of action that is most congenial .
And as far as I can see , there is simply no way to introduce any equivalent of the double blind into this form of econometrics .
Another way of describing this problem is to notice that the business of coming up with a natural experiment to test some hypothesis or other is basically the same thing as looking for a piquant anecdote to illustrate a point .
It 's the same sort of thing that Gladwell or Friedman do , without the statistical manipulation .
And to be honest , the econometric toolkit does not actually add anything much at all to the evidentiary value of a natural experiment - all the persuasive power is in the selection of the " experiment " itself .
I think that this is both a bad thing about the natural experiment literature and a good thing about anecdotal evidence and case studies ( which are , at the end of the day , often a good way of backing up a hypothesis about the world ) .
There is nothing wrong with what Gladwell does , but it is a mistake to think that one is adding anything by taking the semi-attached anecdote and turning it into a regression .
Or to put it another way , the plural of " anecdote " is not " data " - it 's " Freakonomics " .
Postscript I think it makes sense to repeat a third time my disclaimer above that I am specifically not accusing Levitt of sharp statistical practice .
My dislike of the natural experiment methodology is general , and while Levitt is the poster boy for its renaissance in American economics , I think he is simply the expression of much wider trends , which result from much deeper pathologies of the subject , which I 'll be dealing with in Part 5 .
Note in particular that I 've poured a lot of scorn in the past on the " Devastating Critique " school of statistical rhetoric as exemplified by Steve Milloy , where one takes an utterly standard limitation of some methodology or other ( canonically , a suggestion for further research made in the paper itself ) and inflates it into a " Devastating Critique " of the methodology itself .
I have n't changed my mind about " Devastating Critiques " and did n't intend to deliver one here myself .
A fair old amount of Levitt 's work does not use natural experiments , and not all of his natural experiment work is necessarily data - mined .
But a lot of the key claims made in Freakonomics look to me to be based on " Just So " stories where opposing " Just So " stories could easily be told ( Ariel Rubinstein 's review picks out a lot of them ) , and Dubner does not seem to realise how impressive and definitive it is n't that Levitt has converted his " Just So " story into a model .
Parts 4 and 5 to come some time between next week and the heat death of the universe .
[ 1 ] Strictly speaking this regression would n't answer that specific question but cut me some bloody slack here will you .
[ 2 ] Specifically it 's " Two - stage Least Squares " .
IV is a bit more general than this ; it is also possible to do it through the General Method of Moments and Limited Information Maximum Likelihood , which I am fucked if I 'm going to explain because I barely understand them myself .
However , Levitt often uses 2SLS , and I think most of my comments here also to GMM and LIML estimation too .
[ 3 ]
Everyone says this but it is n't really true .
Asymptotically , the IV instrument is unbiased , which is what I mean here .
But weak instrument bias can be a problem in finite sample estimation even with huge numbers of data points - famously , Bound , Jaeger and Baker found it in a study with 329,000 data points
[ 4 ]
Benoit Mandelbrot advocates the widespread use of the Cauchy distribution for capturing the uncertainty of a wide variety of modelling situations .
Oddly enough , many past colleagues describe Benoit Mandelbrot as " a really awkward bastard to deal with " , which perhaps tells us something about self - similarity in general .

ABC : ' Is Murdoch taking over the world ? '
David Edwards and Will Menaker
Published : Wednesday July 18 , 2007 Print This Email This
What do you get for the media tycoon who has everything ?
In Rupert Murdoch 's case it would be another " crown jewel " in his already immense media empire .
Wednesday 's Good Morning America reports on the overnight deal that would add the Dow Jones co. into the Newscorp. fold .
Murdoch appears to be " days away " from completing the $ 5 billion deal that would land him the prestigious Wall Street Journal .
In many ways , the Journal is the " complete antithesis " of Murdoch 's most famous newspaper , The New York Post .
Why would Murdoch care about one newspaper amid a global media empire ?
" Instant credibility " , says Dennis Kneale , managing editor of Forbes , who points out the " nameplate " recognition of the Journal .
While Murdoch insists he will have no editorial control of the paper , others balk at this idea .
Ken Auletta of The New Yorker echoes the fears of many on the Journal staff about Murdoch 's " fair and balanced " track record stating , " his editorial views , political views , and commercial interests bleed into the ways stories are covered . "
The following video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast on July 18 .
Pizza

What a pity that most Americans have never eaten pizza and confuse it for the junk food advertised on television .
In Italy there are laws defining pizza , which set allowances on the type of flour , tomato , mozzarella , olive oil , basil and oregano .
Pizza is inherently nutritious and filling .
Street corner pizza shops in Philadelphia , New York and other large cities kept close to the original idea of simple , fresh ingredients .
Then came the pizza chains , which put most local shops out of business .
Fresh ingredients were replaced with preservative - laden , cheap and fatty ingredients that could be mass - produced , frozen and shipped across the country .
Commercial pizza is now a high - calorie , high - fat , high - sodium , low - nutrient food .
Commercial Organic

It started as a brilliant idea .
Dedicated farmers would become stewards of the land , shunning the toxic chemical pesticides and fertilizers that had proliferated after WWII .
They would raise food naturally , cultivate diverse crop varieties native to their soils .
Animals raised for food would be treated with care and dignity .
And for 30 - some years , this has been the case .
But organic food is so popular that its value system is in jeopardy .
Big players such as Wal - Mart and Kraft want part of the profits , and their demand for cheaper production methods undermines what it means to be organic .
And so we now have organic milk from caged cows force - fed organic grain .
And we have organic junk food with organic ingredients flown in from around the globe , disguised as health food by virtue of the organic label .
Breakfast Cereal
( Image credit : Dreamstime.com )
True cereals --- the likes of wheat , barley , rice and oats , to name a few --- are and have always been the most important food of the human race .
The combination of protein , healthy fat and vitamins is unbeatable .
The word " cereal " has been hijacked , however , by food producers who make tiny , crunchy breakfast cakes out of true cereal with the addition of sugar , corn syrup , salt , food dyes and preservatives .
Try oats with raisins , or barley with 100 - percent fruit spread .
These are far healthier and far cheaper .

Sliced Bread

The most common form of bread in America ( the mass - produced white , soft doughy bread in plastic bags with a shelf life of weeks ) is likely a major component of obesity and diabetes .
True bread is flour and water with a pinch of salt and yeast .
Packaged white bread contains flour plus sugar , corn syrup and often a dozen other ingredients .
The processing creates a food product that , once eaten , is quickly converted to blood sugar , called glucose .
This causes the pancreas to work overtime and ultimately destroys the organ .
Even mass - produced whole wheat breads are unhealthy because they are made palatable by some evil means : the unholy trinity of sugar , salt and softening additives .
Popcorn

Popcorn today rarely resembles the healthy treat it used to be .
Popcorn is , well , corn .
It 's high in fiber , low in calories , and contains only nominal traces of sugar , salt and fat .
That changes , of course , when you add sugar , salt and fat .
Microwave popcorns are the biggest offenders with their long list of ingredients to enhance flavor .
Try buying popcorn kernels in bulk for pennies a serving and control the amount of salt and ( real ) butter .

Russet Potatoes

At the risk of pissing off Idaho , the Russet varieties of potatoes , with their brown skin and white flesh , are only marginally healthy to begin with .
Cheap and hardy , yes , with a few nutrients , they serve some purpose as a filler .
But their starch is quickly converted by the body into blood sugar , called glucose , and raises the risk of diabetes and obesity .
And because they are arguably the least flavorful of the hundreds of potato varieties in the Americas , we have to do things to make them tasty .
We boil and mash them and cover them in butter , or we cut them into strips , deep - fry them and cover them with salt .
Green Tea

Green tea is widely consumed throughout Asia and is nothing short of an art form in Japan .
The tea contains antioxidants and other healthful components shown in clinical studies to possibly prevent cancer , heart disease , senility and other diseases associated with aging .
But most Americans do n't like the taste , so what you get here is a green tea drink loaded with sugar and other additives , sold under the disguise of a health drink .
Any ingredient after the words " green tea " on the bottle chisels away the health benefits .
Canned Soup

Soup is remarkably healthy , inexpensive and easy to make .
A lunch of hardy homemade soup and bread , cooked in bulk and frozen in individual containers for the week , will cost less than a dollar a day .
Canned soup , on the other hand , is a miserable concoction of salt , fat , artificial additives , preservatives , water and maybe part of a carrot .
One serving typically contains 1,000 milligrams of sodium , about half your daily allowance .
Save your chicken and beef bones and vegetable tops and make you own broth .
Yogurt

Armenians in my neighborhood when I was growing up used to make their own yogurt , which is essentially milk fermented with certain bacteria .
This is high in protein , calcium and vitamins and can be eaten by adults , who generally cannot digest milk well .
What is sold in mainstream U.S. supermarkets under the name yogurt is really a dairy dessert loaded with sugar and processed fruit , disguised as a health food .
Try plain , fat - free yogurt and add your own fruit .
Fish Sticks

The fish part is usually pollock , rather healthy .
The stick part seems to be the remaining 20 ingredients listed on the box , which are n't so healthy .
Doctors have been advising people to eat more fish for years , because they are high in healthy fats and low in unhealthy fats compared to beef and pork .
Yet when you buy processed fish products or when you order deep - fried fish from a fast - food joint , the bad starts to outweigh the good .

Rats do unto others as they have been done to .
A helping paw : rats are more generous when another rat has helped them out .
Punchstock
Rats that benefit from the charity of others are more likely to help strangers get a free meal , researchers have found .
This phenomenon , known as ' generalized reciprocity ' , has only ever been seen before in humans .
A good example , says Michael Taborsky of the University of Bern , Switzerland , is what happens when someone finds money in a phone box .
In controlled experiments such people have been shown to be much more likely to help out a stranger in need following their good luck .
In humans , such benevolence can be explained by cultural factors as well as by underlying biology , says Taborsky .
But if similar behaviour can be found in other animals , he reasons , an evolutionary explanation would be far more likely .
To test for this behaviour in animals , Taborsky trained rats to pull a lever that produced food for its partner , but not for itself .
Rats who had received a free meal in this way were found to be 20 % more likely to help out an unknown partner than rats who had received no such charity1 .
Taborsky believes this behaviour is n't confined to just rats and humans .
" I 'm convinced generalized reciprocity will be very widespread and found in many different animal species , as our study suggests that an underlying evolutionary mechanism is responsible . "
" Generalized reciprocity is certainly underappreciated in animals , " notes Laurent Keller , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Lausanne , Switzerland .
But with so little data in this area , he adds , " it is very difficult to make predictions about how prevalent it 's likely to be . "
Survival of the friendliest
Explaining why animals cooperate has long been a tricky area for evolutionary biologists .
According to darwinian evolution , organisms are adapted to maximize their individual chances of survival , so how is it possible to account for acts of charity ?
Among family members , it makes sense for one animal to help another in order to help their shared genes to get on in the world .
But when it comes to helping non-family members , things are more complicated .
It might make sense for one animal to help another in exchange for receiving help themselves later on .
But this is open to abuse by cheats who are happy to take , but not to give in return .
Highly intelligent animals — including humans — can judge whether or not to give help based on the individual track record of a specific potential partner .
But this kind of ' direct ' reciprocation between two individuals only happens under restricted conditions , says Taborsky .
" Animals have to meet frequently and have to remember what other individuals have done and how they acted in the past .
That means animals have to possess high cognitive abilities .
And for these reasons it has n't been demonstrated very often . "
Another strategy , called ' generalized reciprocity ' , is for an animal to assume that its most recent interaction with any other individual is representative of how the whole community usually behaves .
In that case , an animal only has to remember its last experience .
" It 's a simpler mechanism and therefore more likely to be evolutionarily important , " says Taborsky .
Not - so - dirty rats
Taborsky thinks he has seen both types of reciprocity in his rats .
In addition to being 20 % more likely to help out an unknown partner if they had received a bit of charity , his study shows that rats were more than 50 % more likely to help a specific rat who had helped them in the past1 .
Taborsky thinks that it is likely that the two forms of reciprocity work together .
If an animal can remember how generous another individual is it will use this information to decide whether it 's wise to cooperate .
But if not , then it can base its decision on more general recent experience — how helpful other animals have been towards it in the recent past .
ADVERTISEMENT
Other researchers point out that because rats typically live in family groups , it 's hard to discount the idea that they 're just trying to help their relatives out .
" What we need to understand now is the physiological and neurological mechanisms responsible , " says Taborsky .
He suspects that hormonal changes in response to charity might be behind the tendency to cooperate .
" We are going to look at hormonal regulation , and we 're also looking at other animals — cichlid fish at the moment . "

Spend enough time on the campaign trail and you really do wonder how presidential candidates manage to stay sane .
Twenty - four hours into John McCain ’s announcement tour , the venues have already started to run together in a blur of streamers , hot - dog stands , and high - school bands playing “ This Land Is Your Land ” in the same trumpet squall .
The senator has received all manner of pointless tchotchkes and doodads .
( “ Do you know how many baseball caps a candidate gets per day ? ” asks Michael Deaver , the old Reagan hand . )
He has said I ’m not the youngest candidate , but I am the most experienced at least six times .
Twice , he ’s had to smile — and act as if he found it so original — when his supporters gave him valedictory send - offs to the tune of “ Barbara Ann , ” a nod to the “ Bomb Iran ” wisecrack he made some weeks back .
And somewhere between New Hampshire and South Carolina , the Arizona senator has gotten into a tense quarrel with the press corps , who cannot believe that a man who bills himself as a straight talker refused , just the day before , to answer their questions about Alberto Gonzales until they ’d already filed their stories — at which point he told Larry King he thought the attorney general should resign .
“ Well , the fact is , I wanted yesterday ’s stories to be about the announcement of our campaign , ” says McCain when confronted about the discrepancy at a press conference .
“ If your tender feelings are bruised , then I apologize . ”
Given America ’s unconcern with the Geneva Conventions and McCain ’s own harrowing history as a prisoner of war , perhaps Mark McKinnon , an adviser to the senator , could find a more delicate metaphor when he compares the process of running for president to torture .
But he ’s certainly onto something .
“ Think about it , ” he says .
“ There ’s sleep deprivation .
You do n’t know when your next meal is .
You have the same sensory stimuli over and over until it drives you crazy .
People are asking you questions , trying to trap you .
And you ’re watched all the time .
It ’s designed to break you down . ”
It ’s also the last remaining freak show in the United States , which is hardly to everyone ’s taste .
Gary Bauer , a Republican Evangelical who made a quixotic primary bid in 2000 , says he had a hard enough time coping with the “ butter lady ” at the Iowa State Fair .
“ Her claim to fame was that she always brought sculptures made completely out of butter , ” he says .
“ They were displayed in a refrigerated case .
And … well , you ’re going to think I ’m making this up , but guess what the sculpture was that year ? ”
A bust of his head ?
“ No , ” he says .
“ That I probably could have dealt with .
No , no .
It was the famous painting of the Lord ’s Supper .
The Lord ’s Supper !
It was humongous .
The length of this room ” — he points to the opposite wall of his Arlington , Virginia , office , maybe twelve feet away — “ and pretty darn deep .
I ’m serious .
The entire scene of Christ and all the disciples .
And I do n’t even know how you react to that . ”
When Bob Dole ran for president in 1996 , he says , the journalists who followed him knew his stump speech so well they ’d recite it on the plane .
After two days of following McCain , I realize I could probably do the same .
Already I can reel off his jokes , his favorite rhetorical questions , and , of course , his tagline :
That ’s not good enough for America .
And when I ’m president , it wo n’t be good enough for me !
Which raises a crucial question :
If I ’m already sick of McCain , how does McCain feel ?
“ I get tired of some of it , ” he says , as we roll along on the Straight Talk Express .
“ But there ’ll always be new issues , new aspects of whatever the issues are .
They ’re always changing , when you think about it . ”
And this is a fine answer , a perfectly politic answer .
Any man with serious presidential ambitions cannot say how anesthetizing , peculiar , or extravagantly nuts he finds certain aspects of the modern American presidential campaign .
But his response was disappointing somehow , and it ’s only later that I realized why :
It was rote .
Even this question — Golly , how can you stand it ?
— John McCain had probably been asked a dozen times before .
Authenticity has become a dominant meme of this campaign season .
From the very beginning of the 2008 cycle , both parties — or large segments of them , anyway — seemed eager to find a presidential candidate who did n’t suffer from a phoniness problem .
Admittedly , Democrats experienced this desire more urgently than Republicans , because the men their party ran in the past two elections looked as if they ’d been specifically selected for their extra coatings of polyurethane .
With Al Gore , voters at least sensed that there was another man rattling around in there somewhere — a funnier man , one who cared deeply about the environment and had a gift for explaining why we should , too — and An Inconvenient Truth showed this to be true .
With John Kerry , the problem ran deeper :
To this day , it ’s not clear what he ’s passionate about .
( He was more like the random books one finds on the shelf at a summer share — palatable , but loved by no one . )

After Kerry ’s defeat , many Democrats thought it a sensible goal to find a nominee in 2008 who was n’t stage - managed and poll - tested within an inch of his or her life .
But 2008 is supposed to be Hillary ’s year .
And , as millions discovered this March , she looks entirely plausible in a parody of an Apple campaign based on 1984 .
Complicating matters further this cycle is the advent of YouTube .
When television came along , politics may have become a scripted teleplay .
But with YouTube , it ’s a reality show , where the audience gets to see not only the final , blow - dried product , but the blow - drying itself ( John Edwards , predictably , is the poster boy for this effect ) , as it happens in real time .
This is a very profound change .
YouTube has the power to expose the lies that make political theater possible .
It has the power to show how backstage versions of our politicians can , at times , not just be unlovely but directly contradict the image of the person we see on television .
If this new world of amateur surveillance makes candidates paranoid and self - censoring , their speech really could be like something out of 1984 — measured , state - approved , one size fits all .
This year , each primary , in a sense , is a contest between those who are fake and those who are not .
One of the main sources of Barack Obama ’s appeal is that he ’s not Hillary , as the Apple - Orwell - 1984 mash - up so pitilessly pointed out .
Rather , he seems a fellow with a low zombie quotient — someone who wrote a moving and introspective memoir , someone who sang the Muslim call to prayer for the New York Times ’
Nicholas Kristof and called it “ one of the prettiest sounds on Earth at sunset . ”
( As Kristof wrote , this is n’t exactly going to endear the man to voters in Alabama . )
On the Republican side , there ’s Mitt Romney at one extreme ( high zombie quotient ) , Rudy Giuliani at the other ( still hewing to the pro-choice line , still talking with the cheerful opinionatedness of a New York City mayor ) , and McCain as a kind of phoniness parable , a cautionary example of what happens when a leopard tries to change its spots .
Back in early 2000 , McCain lived up to the overused moniker of maverick , saying whatever popped into his head , including his unmistakable conviction that Jerry Falwell and his brethren were “ agents of intolerance . ”
Yet at the beginning of this cycle , when it was clear he stood a real chance of winning , the shorter odds corrupted him , prompting him to give the commencement speech at Falwell ’s Liberty University and make a few other cynical overtures to the conservative base .
It cost him dearly among independents , according to polls .
Now , with some modifications , he ’s back to his old self , criticizing Bush and cursing those who stand in his way .
( Recently , when Senator John Cornyn gave him grief about his immigration bill , he succinctly retorted , “ Fuck you . ” )
“ You ’d be amazed at how many senators are shy people .
They hate running for office .
They just force themselves . ”
— Gary Hart
It ’s easy to blame the system , the endless fund - raising and staged events and media scrutiny that borders on the proctological , for the current epidemic of phoniness .
If only , the argument goes , a system could be arranged where politicians ’ real selves and real ideas were always and everywhere on display , we would have the politics we deserve .
But it ’s also possible that phoniness , at least in certain forms , serves an important purpose .
It may even be a desirable quality in politics .
It ’s certainly something we consistently choose , consciously or not .
In The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life , a seminal social - science book that ’s a de facto primer on effective political communication , sociologist Erving Goffman gives a great deal of thought to how people show themselves to the world , viewing all forms of human interaction as a kind of managed drama .
“ When the individual has no belief in his own act and no ultimate concern with the beliefs of his audience , ” he writes , “ we may call him cynical , reserving the term ‘ sincere ’ for the individuals who believe in the impression fostered by their own performance . ”
Anyone who ’s listened to Mitt Romney for more than ten seconds can surely grasp this distinction .
But there ’s a whole spectrum of behaviors , Goffman notes , between these two extremes .
Sometimes sincere actors delude their audiences because their audiences want to be lied to — body - conscious women in clothing stores , patients taking placebos .
Sometimes people grow into roles that were once unnatural .
Sometimes they grow disenchanted with roles they once inhabited so well .
And sometimes actors believe in the sincerity of their performance and its fraudulence all at once .
But whatever the circumstances , writes Goffman , part of playing a role well is learning how to suppress spontaneous reactions .
In political terms , this is part of what ’s known as message discipline .
More broadly speaking , Goffman ’s point is that it ’s important , in any performance , to maintain the line between audience and actor .
As Bob Kerrey , the former Nebraska governor and senator who ran in the Democratic primary in 1992 , points out , “ One of the things I discovered when I became governor of Nebraska is , ‘ There ’s a role I gotta play here . ’
We did n’t have to put on robes and all that , obviously .
But I had to learn how to be this person . ”

But who can best learn to be the president ?
Seeking the forces that are driving the political process leading up to the election in 2008 , I wanted to look at this process from the inside , from the point of view of those who ’ve undergone it in the past or are undergoing it now .
What does it do to a person to devote all his or her energies to something that can seem so ludicrous ?
Do you have to be a mannequin to survive a pageant ?
Does the process turn you into one ?
Exactly whom do you have to be ?
McCain is sitting in the back of the Straight Talk Express , having a lively dispute with a reporter about what , precisely , Harry Reid , the majority leader of the Senate , meant when he said the war was lost .
“ He meant it could n’t be won militarily , ” the reporter says .
“ Well , that ’s the way wars are usually decided , ” McCain replies , giving her a look of deadpan exasperation .
“ Generally speaking . ”
Then , gamely : “ Though sometimes they are decided by a jousting match !
Between two selectees !
Of the opposing armies ! ”
For all of McCain ’s attempts to recast himself as a mainstream character , he remains , at bottom , an insurgent , someone whose instincts are more rebellious than political .
One senses it has something to do with the five and a half years he spent in a POW camp in Vietnam — after enduring the things he did , what does he care if he pisses off people or speaks his mind ?
( As the late Michael Kelly was fond of noting , veterans often make interesting political candidates for this reason . )
But whatever the provenance of McCain ’s candor , it ’s been in full flower recently .
In addition to the recent “ fuck you ” incident , he told bloggers he had little patience with Mitt Romney ’s wifty positions on immigration : “ Maybe he can get out his small varmint gun and drive those Guatemalans off his yard . ”
He also piquantly highlighted Obama ’s failure , in a press release , to spell a word a president ought to know : “ By the way , Senator Obama , it ’s ‘ flak ’ jacket , not a ‘ flack ’ jacket . ”
“ I would much rather have a phony , competent person in the White House than an incompetent , authentic person .
I ’m not sure the two are n’t correlated :
The greater competence you ’ve got , the more you ’ve got to be phony in order to get the job done . ”
— Bob Kerrey
In the Straight Talk Express , McCain has found the vehicle , both literally and figuratively , that plays to his strengths .
In the protected confines of a bus , he ’s free to schmooze , argue , uncork in his loony - tunes way .
The problem is that this discursive quality does n’t translate well into the rigid formatting of televised debate — he looks tense , rattling through his talking points like an auctioneer — and his irreverence is positively jarring out of context .
Think of the angry reaction to his “ Bomb Iran ” moment , or the moment on The Daily Show when he awkwardly joked he ’d picked up an improvised explosive device at the Baghdad market .
It ’s worth pointing out that McCain sang “ Bomb Iran ” to a small VFW hall of veterans like himself ( in response to a very specific question : “ When do we send ’em an airmail package to Tehran ? ” ) , and two days after his appearance on The Daily Show , he twice referred to roadblocks to immigration reform as “ IEDs , ” rather than “ obstacles . ”
Unless you follow McCain on the campaign trail , you ’d never know how war metaphors suffuse his speech .
Zephyr Teachout , the Internet philosopher and director of online organizing for Howard Dean ’s primary campaign in 2004 , writes in an e-mail that she sees two possible directions political discourse could take in a YouTube age :
The first future , the gloomy one , is one in which constant surveillance turns our politicians into plastic people , and turns creative , thoughtful people — people who are willing to think out loud — off from pursuing public office .
The second future is the one in which the current plasticness becomes so unsustainable that it goes the other way — we become much more comfortable with awkward phrasing .
Unfortunately , she concludes , the gloomy future strikes her as the more likely one .
It has something to do with the way the media — writ large , new and old — teaches us all to be strategists , not citizens , and to think poorly of someone as a strategist , not a person , for saying something stupid .
The irony in this new , strange age of amateur surveillance is that the old media may also come to the rescue .
The press at least mediates ( it ’s not called the media for nothing ) , providing context for remarks and maintaining confidentiality if certain things were said off the record or in jest .
It ’s yet another reason McCain may like the Straight Talk Express so much .
On the bus , I ask him if YouTube is going to make him more neurotic about what he says in small settings .
“ I ca n’t be any different , ” he says .
“ This is a tough slog ” — another war metaphor — “ everybody knows that .
You gotta be who you are .
But will I make some mistakes ?
Absolutely .
Stand by . ”

Paul Begala , one of the senior advisers to Bill Clinton in 1992 , makes a useful observation about his former boss , and oddly enough , he invokes Goffman to do it .
“ Erving Goffman used to make the distinction between front stage and backstage personas , ” he says .
The terms are self - explanatory — front stage is who the audience sees , and backstage is who intimates see , the person we suppress while performing .
“ Bill Clinton has the least distance between his front stage and his backstage personas out of anyone I know . ”
Deaver says the same thing about Ronald Reagan .
It ca n’t be an accident that both of these men were the two most popular presidents of the late - twentieth century .
Nor can it be an accident that men with more private selves — Gore , Kerry , Dole — had a harder time when they stepped into the limelight .
I ask Kerry ’s former campaign adviser Mary Beth Cahill when the senator seemed most like himself on the campaign trail , and her answer is startling : “ On the plane , I think , when he ’d be in the front cabin , playing his guitar by himself . ”
He was most like himself , in other words , when he was alone .
Yet here ’s a wrinkle : McCain is also the same both front stage and back .
Many mavericks are .
Bob Kerrey .
Chuck Hagel .
( Also both Vietnam vets , it should be noted . )
So why do they seem like longer shots for president ?
What makes them different ?
Why do n’t they have the same success ?
‘ They would n’t let me be funny ! ” Dole is saying , then catches himself .
“ Well , they . ”
He leans back .
He ’s sitting in one of the stateliest rooms in his suite at Alston & Bird , yet looking uncharacteristically informal : navy slacks and no jacket , legs stretched way out , as if lounging on a deck chair .
“ They kind of said , ‘ We do n’t want a comedian .
This is serious business . ’ ”
Bob Dole is not a man whose front - stage and backstage personas were the same , at least while he was in politics .
Backstage , Dole was a total cut - up ; front stage , he was stiff , gruff — and 1996 was a real improvement over 1988 , when he made a credible primary run .
( Then , his front - stage persona was perilously close to Darth Vader ’s , minus the wheezing . )
So one of the first questions I ask when I visit him at his law office in Washington is , Why was n’t he funny on the stump ?
And his answer is , They would n’t let me .
“ I do n’t think anyone asked him not to be funny , ” explains William Lacy , a former Dole adviser .
“ We just saw the importance of more message discipline , of having a message every day to get across , and that ’s something he struggled with . ”
The trouble with humor , explains Lacy , is that it ’s discursive — once Dole got rolling , there was no stopping him .
That worked just fine when he first came of age politically , stopping in people ’s farmhouses and putting 50,000 miles on his car , but television changed all that .
He never got used to it .
Bob Dole the person was so alienated from Bob Dole the brand that he referred to it — referred to himself — in the third person .
“ I had trouble staying on message , yeah , that was one of my problems , ” says Dole .
“ I ’d wander into some forest somewhere and finally get back to where I was supposed to be .
But after you give the same speech over and over , you do n’t have the enthusiasm !
It ’s not like , Boy , I ’ve got a great speech here — I ’m going to go out and wow the crowd ! ”
Indeed , that tends to be something natural performers , like Clinton and Reagan , are far better at pulling off .
To them , it does n’t feel like dreary repetition .
The transaction with the crowd , not the words themselves , gives them energy .
I ask Dole about the pageantry and props that come with the territory .
“ Yeah , I found it hard to do a lot of those things , ” he says .
“ All the stupid things you wear — the jackets are okay , but the aprons and big tall chef ’s caps while you ’re serving chop suey or whatever it is .
You look like a monkey . ”
He thinks some more , then remembers something .
“ A parade in Illinois — Wheaton , Illinois — Bob Woodward ’s hometown , think his father was a judge there . ”
Dole is filled with such asides .
“ It was n’t that I was wearing anything .
But I remember the incident well , because this lady came rushing out with her baby and handed me her baby .
But I do n’t use my right arm .
And my left is not too strong .
So , uh , I ’m just scared to death . ”
He never says what happened to the child .
He simply says what happened next : “ Somebody next to me got under me right away and caught the baby . ”

He tells this story so matter - of - factly it ’s easy to miss the punch line — and its implications .
As a wounded World War II veteran , Dole went an entire presidential campaign giving people the impression he was afraid of small kids .
“ You know , people want you to kiss the babies , hold the babies , ” says Dole .
“ It ’s fine .
But , uh , I remember that very well .
I was scared to death . ”
Not that Dole ever had much of a chance .
The economy was thriving ; Clinton ’s popularity was high .
He says it took a toll on him sometimes , having to pretend the election was winnable .
“ I said at my convention that I ’m the most optimistic man in America , ” he says .
“ But privately … you know .
When you kinda have that cloud hangin ’ over , it does n’t look good . ”
Dole had to exit political life in order to bring his backstage and front - stage personas into alignment .
Today , he ’s everything his advisers wished he were then : open about his disability , sunny , funny .
Like Gore , he just needed a different kind of media experience — appearances on Letterman , commercials about Viagra and Pepsi — to get him there .
“ I can remember the Secret Service dropping me off on Election Night , ” he concludes .
“ You know — good - bye ! ” He gives a little wave .
“ And then you say , ‘ What do I do tomorrow ? ’ ” He smiles , and I notice that his right arm , which he ’d always taken such enormous care to hike up and close around a pen , now rests , relaxed , at his right side .
The pen ’s still there .
But the tension ’s gone .
“ But somebody has to win , ” he says .
“ And somebody has to lose . ”
“ This Lady came rushing out and handed me her baby .
But I do n’t use my right arm .
And my left is not too strong .
So , uh , I ’m just scared to death . ”
Dole never says what happened to the child .
He simply says what happened next .
“ Somebody next to me got under me right away and caught the baby . ”
Years ago , while they were serving together in the Senate , Bob Kerrey and John McCain both worked on the POW / MIA committee .
It was an extremely sensitive assignment for both of them , but even more so for McCain , who ’d been a prisoner of war .
Over the course of the year , Kerrey recalls , McCain got so incensed at a fellow senator — an Iowa farmer named Chuck Grassley — he was convinced McCain was going to bodily harm him during a meeting with colleagues and staff .
“ I knew he was n’t going to stand up and hit Grassley , ” says Kerrey , “ because when John came out of the plane in Vietnam , his arms were ripped out of his sockets , and they rebroke them several times when he was in prison .
But I am thinking ,
He ’s going to head - butt Grassley and drive the cartilage in his nose into his brain .
I ’m going to watch a colleague kill a colleague .
That ’ll give me something to remember on this day . ”
McCain did n’t head - butt his colleague .
Instead , he kept repeating , “ You know what your problem is , Senator ?
You do n’t listen , ” until the two men were nose - to - nose .
Then McCain revised his opinion : “ But that ’s not your problem .
Your problem is , you ’re a fucking jerk . ”
“ John hates when I tell this story , ” says Kerrey .
“ But I like that anger .
When he got mad , I liked that he became Shiva . ”
Shiva is the Hindu god of destruction , the destroyer of worlds .
“ I have a very high regard for John McCain , ” he adds .
“ But in a campaign , that temperament becomes an issue . ”
Straight talk , in other words , may be hazardous to a political career , as welcome as it may be .
Hello ?
Hi , Brian .
When do you want to come over ?
I ’ve got a meeting from 3:30 to 4:30 ; otherwise I ’m clear …
I am sitting in Michael Dukakis ’s office at Northeastern University , where he is , ever the retail politician , answering his own phone .
He finishes , looks up , and apologizes .
“ I loved the primary , ” he begins , recalling the golden days of 1988 , before his campaign ended in an electoral rout .
“ Because I ’m a guy who loves campaigning on the ground .
I would n’t have been made dogcatcher if I were n’t a grass - roots , precinct - based sort of guy .
But once you ’re the nominee … then you get security .
I never had it as governor ” — of Massachusetts , his day job at the time — “ so I was the last candidate on either side to say yes to the Secret Service .
And if it had n’t been for 15,000 absolutely insane Greeks in Astoria that almost trampled us to death with their enthusiasm … ” Kitty , his wife , remembers it well .
They were shaking the car with such vigor she thought they were going to turn it over .
“ Once you say yes to the Secret Service , a kind of walling off takes place , ” he says .
“ And I found it difficult . ”
During the 1988 presidential campaign , Dukakis came across as cold , academic , and overly righteous .
It is shocking how different he comes across in a small setting .
In his office , his style is warm and unfussy ; he ’s a careful listener and questioner .
Even the famous Velcro eyebrows make sense .
They give his eyes depth .

“ Now , are there ways to break through that ? ” he asks .
“ Yeah .
I think the Clinton - Gore bus trips were an inspired idea .
I ’m sorry we did n’t have those .
Because on that level , you see things , people tell you about things .
Drove the Secret Service crazy , but Clinton and Gore got the kind of spontaneity — the kind of learning — you do n’t get in canned events , where you ’re up in the plane , down , up in the plane , down . ”
Like Dole , Dukakis did n’t have a flair for the up in the plane , down .
“ Part of the problem here is that most of us — I do n’t care whether it ’s Dukakis , Gore , Hart , whoever — most of us started in politics in living rooms and backyards and Legion halls , ” Dukakis concludes .
He ’s talking about himself in the third person , just like Dole , as if to say , that politician - fellow named Mike Dukakis is a different man entirely .
“ And generally speaking , if I may say so , we ’re very good at it .
But see , how do ya translate that ?
I ca n’t deliver a speech off prepared text for love nor money .
If I had a nickel for everybody who ’s come up to me since 1988 and said , ‘ You ’re nothing like the guy we were watching on television … ’ I say to them , well , that was eight seconds .
Clinton — Clinton can do it in eight seconds .
Reagan .
I gotta spend an hour with people . ”
Anything short of that had the potential to result in disaster .
During the second presidential debate , CNN ’s Bernard Shaw famously asked Dukakis whether the death penalty would be appropriate if a stranger raped and killed his wife .
He gave a characteristically unemotional answer :
No , I do n’t , Bernard .
And I think you know that I ’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life …
People say it cost him the election .
Kitty herself was stunned .
( “ Afterwards , I turned to him in the car and said , ‘ What were you thinking ? ’ ” she says . )
“ Look , when you ’re opposed to the death penalty , you ’re asked that question a thousand times , ” Dukakis says today .
“ Unfortunately , I answered it as if I ’d been asked it a thousand times .
Folks expected more , I guess . ”
A couple weeks ago , Warren Beatty called me up and said , ‘ Let me ask you something :
Do you think you have to be crazy to run for president ? ’ ”
This is Gary Hart , the Democratic senator who swept half the primaries in 1984 before flaming out .
“ And I said , ‘ What do you mean ?
Not crazy crazy , right ? ’ ” he says .
“ And he said , ‘ Well , not conventionally normal . ’
And I began to think about that .
Because I … I do n’t think I ’m crazy .
But I think what he was getting at was some combination of compulsion , drivenness , neuroses — who knows ? ”
What does he mean , who knows ?
He ran for president .
What are the excesses of a presidential personality ?
“ Well , high energy .
And a bit of … let ’s see .
Whatever the sane side of messianic is .
A sense that you can see farther ahead than most people .
I ’ve always felt that that was my strength , that I could see farther ahead than most people . ”
Whatever the sane side of messianic is .
Because of its fractured grammar , this is possibly the loveliest — and truest — iteration of a campaign cliché , that a candidate for president must have a vision to convey .
“ And an ability to relate , ” he adds .
“ And I ’ll tell you how this is strange .
The tagline for me throughout ’ 83 was ‘ cool and aloof . ’
But the only reason ‘ cool and aloof ’ came about is because I was shy — instead of working a room , I ’d get my back against the wall .
But I ’d get into a conversation , and within twenty minutes , I had the whole room around me . ”
How does a shy person run for president ?
He gives a mild shrug .
“ There ’s a stereotypical belief that to be a politician , you have to need acclaim and gratification and acceptance , ” he says .
“ I never did .
You would be amazed at the number of senators who are shy people .
They hate running for office .
They just force themselves .
You ’ll do whatever it takes , if you have that sense of seeing over the horizon . ”
Hart is surely right .
Given the right circumstances , a shy person can become president .
But if history is any guide , it helps to be the kind of person who ’s amenable to the steady breaches of privacy that a president must endure .
“ If you were running for office , this is what I ’d say to you , ” says Bob Kerrey , now head of the New School .
“ At some point , arriving in your life is an organization called the United States Secret Service .
And when the Secret Service arrives , you ca n’t open your own car door .
They interfere with all your neighbors ; anyone who wants to get in contact with you has to deal with them .
So the best advice I could ever give to a candidate is , Think about this .
You might win . ”
“ The moment I remember , ” Kerrey continues , “ is discovering that Bill Clinton wanted to live in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
He had intentionally overnighted there when Jimmy Carter was president .
He knew where the living spaces were .
He knew what they looked like .
He had a feel for what that experience was going to be , and it made him feel good .
Whereas when I got to thinking about living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , it gave me the chills . ”
What about it ?
“ What about it ?
I was single . ”
And this suggests the biggest distinction between candidates like Kerrey and McCain versus candidates like Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan .
It ’s true that both have the same front - stage and backstage personas .
But for people like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton , the front - stage persona is the person backstage .
Clinton especially : Even when the cameras are n’t rolling , he ’s always performing .
The fantasy about Clinton is that he ’s exactly like you or me .
But he ’s nothing like you or me .
After I followed him around Africa for seven days in 2005 , this , to me , was the most startling revelation .
Even in the most solitary circumstances , he lit up like a Christmas tree .
He enjoyed performing in these quiet circumstances , often repeating the same jokes and anecdotes , including ones that had already appeared in his autobiography .
It was like an imaginary camera was always rolling .
Everything he said seemed meant for a dais .
Reagan , though less pyrotechnic in style , had a similar openness .
Deaver points out , “ His whole adult life had been public . ”
And by the time he became president , adds Ed Rollins , another one of his advisers , “ having 10,000 people clapping for him did n’t do anything unusual to him .
Some people , the adrenaline gets them so high they ramble . ”
Or yelp , as was the case of Howard Dean — Yeeeeeeeow !
And in that yelp is the difference .
For politicians like Dean , McCain , Kerrey , or ( yes , sorry ) Ross Perot , their backstage personas were what they trotted out front , not the other way around .
For Dean , this meant we saw arrogance , hotheadedness , and a teenager ’s response to a screaming crowd ( Yeeeeeeeow ! ) in addition to his candor and passion .
With Perot , we saw a barking loony .
With Kerrey , we saw ambivalence ( his Senate colleagues called him “ Cosmic Bob ” ) and dread about losing his privacy .
And with McCain , we see anger and irreverence .
These are all emotions we associate with private settings .
They are not ones we generally haul out for public view .
Yet in almost every campaign cycle , the press has a brief romance with the candidates whose backstage personalities are also out front .
They are invariably the most entertaining people as well as the most relatable .
But they seldom hold up over the long haul .
The rougher parts of themselves eventually start to worry us .
“ I would muuuuch rather have a phony , competent person in the White House than an incompetent , authentic person , ” says Kerrey .
“ I ’m not sure the two are n’t correlated :
The greater competence you ’ve got , the more you ’ve got to be phony in order to get the job done .
I want my president to put a mask on .
When they ’re negotiating for a national - security agreement ?
Put the mask on .
When they ’re negotiating with Congress ?
Put the mask on .
If someone says to me a politician is phony , my response , at some point , is , ‘ Well , they gotta be .
That ’s their job . ’ ”
This front - stage –backstage distinction is a weirdly good predictor of who survives presidential races , and probably forces us to rethink what authenticity means in politics — and who , in 2008 , might survive over the long haul .
Obama , for instance , does n’t suffer using this guideline .
Even backstage , in one - on - one interviews , he ’s smooth , collected , disciplined , in control .
Perhaps more surprising , though , is that Hillary does n’t necessarily suffer using this guideline either .
Like many people , I used to assume that it was public life , and more specifically the unique constraints of her marriage , that made her build a carapace around herself .
And I ’m sure it ’s partly true .
But people who ’ve known
Hillary a long time say her emotional life has always been opaque .
As far back as Wellesley , her peers were in awe of her composure , trying to figure out who she was underneath .
Though there probably is another Hillary buried somewhere in her , she ’s spent so long in her current role that she ’s more or less internalized it , the way soldiers internalize their place in the army .
Last month , the Times reported that Hillary has hired a communications consultant who trains his clients to “ jam ” and “ get to cool . ”
It ’s a rotten idea .
Hillary may as well lead with her weakness , as she did in her Senate race , embracing the fact that she ’s contained but serious about the job .
If she can convince the public that she is n’t a cold schemer , but simply a woman of purpose and reserve — that that ’s who she is , front stage and back — she has a shot .
( It ’s certainly one possible explanation for her strong poll numbers . )
It might even be the ideal for the first female commander - in - chief .
McCain has the opposite problem .
As exhilarating as it would be for someone as candid as he is to step into the Oval Office , voters would have to radically depart from their previous patterns to choose a man whose backstage rawness was in full frontal view .
Right until September 10 , New Yorkers would have said that Giuliani ’s backstage rawness was in full frontal view , too ( as when he told a ferret - loving talk - show caller , “ There is something really , really very sad about you ” ) .
But the events of September 11 recast his front - stage persona from bully to hero , and as the Times pointed out last week , he ’s been extremely disciplined on the trail , keeping his cheerful insults to a minimum .
( And this may explain his good poll numbers . )
Though many , especially New Yorkers , are still waiting for the other Rudy , the sharp - tongued and freewheeling egomaniac ( in the manner of most New York City mayors ) , to reappear .
One of the most stunning asides Goffman makes in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life is based not on his own observation but that of Robert Ezra Park , a founder of the Chicago School of sociology .
He noted that the word person itself comes from the Latin word persona , or actor ’s mask .
“ Insofar as this mask represents the conception we have formed of ourselves — the role we are striving to live up to — this mask is our truer self , the person we would like to be , ” Goffman quotes him as saying .
Viewed in this light , the performances our politicians give are n’t necessarily cynical but aspirational , idealistic even :
Some are using this process to become the person they think they ’re meant to be .
All the butter sculptures and corn dogs and ceaseless repetition of platitudes — this bizarre , debasing torture of our candidates — may actually contribute to something positive .
Phoniness may just be a kind of chrysalis , a stage a politician must pass through in order to become presidential .
The trouble is , not all of them make it .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A majority of Americans do n't trust the upcoming report by the Army 's top commander in Iraq on the progress of the war and even if they did , it would n't change their mind , according to a new poll .
Gen. David Petraeus confers with officers in Iraq in July .
His progress report on the war is due next month .
President Bush frequently has asked Congress -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his so - called troop surge in Iraq until Gen.
David Petraeus , the commander in Iraq , and Ryan Crocker , U.S. ambassador to Iraq , issue their progress report in September .
But according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday , 53 percent of people polled said they suspect that the military assessment of the situation will try to make it sound better than it actually is .
Forty - three percent said they do trust the report .
CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said he does n't think the mistrust is directed at Petreaus as much as it is what he represents .
Holland said , " I suspect most people are hearing the words ' general ' and ' Iraq ' and that 's what they 're basing their opinion on . "
He added , " It does seem to indicate that anyone associated with the Bush administration may be a less than credible messenger for the message that there is progress being made in Iraq . "
Another interesting thing about the poll , Holland said , is that it indicates that about half of those surveyed -- 47 percent -- feel that the military is making progress in Iraq , although slightly more -- 49 percent -- do not .
White House press secretary Tony Snow reacted to the poll , saying that he hoped that " people do not try to engage in personal attacks on Gen. Petraeus or Ambassador Crocker . "
" David Patraeus is basically the guy who 's written the manual on counterinsurgency , and the one thing that you see with returning Democratic and Republican congressman is that something very significant has taken place , " Snow said .
How the report is phrased also might determine how it is received , Holland said .
If the report details military progress , that might be better received than what political progress the Iraqi government is making .
Twenty - six percent of those polled feel that the Iraqi government is making progress , while 69 percent said that it was n't .
" We have n't done a lot of polling about the Iraqi government , " Holland said , " but the numbers we have seem to indicate that people are pretty skeptical of any government official in Iraq . "
The poll indicates that most of America 's mind is made up about the war -- 72 percent said the report will have no effect on their view of the war .
Of those opposed to the war , 47 percent said Petreaus ' report could not change their mind while 17 percent said it could .
Thirty - three percent said they support the war .
The poll was based on interviews of 1,029 Americans by telephone between August 6 and 8 .
The sampling error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points , except for the questions based on the respondents ' support or lack of support of the war , which was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .

A Vermont prosecutor has dropped dog- taunting charges against Jayna Hutchinson of Lebanon , New Hampshire , thus possibly averting a constitutional showdown over free expression .
Hutchinson was arrested on July 31 after police responded to reports of a brawl going on at a market in the town of West Fairlee .
Hutchinson was not part of the brawl , and in fact approached the officers to tell them that she had been assaulted the day before by one of the men who was fighting .
But the officers refused to take her statement , noting that she appeared to be drunk ( she was ) and telling her that they would take a statement another time .
That did not please Hutchinson , and after words were exchanged she then allegedly approached the police car and engaged in the dog - taunting behavior .
According to Sgt. Todd Protzman ’s affidavit , Hutchinson approached the car , put her face close to the window behind which police dog Max was minding his own police business and " star[ed ] at him in a taunting / harassing manner . "
( Most reports of this incident claim that Hutchinson " made faces " at the dog , and that may be true but the details of any such faces were not provided .
It makes a good headline , however . )
The affidavit was not so clear as to why this justified an arrest .
" While the defendant taunted my canine , " Sgt. Protzman wrote , " Max was focused on the defendant and the perceived threat she presented to him .
He was no longer focused on me and the other officers at the scene . "
This may be an argument that Max could not perform his duties due to the distraction of Hutchinson ’s glare , but since Max was evidently still sitting inside the police car and not performing any duties , it sounds more like they were just jealous .
Whatever the reason , the officers arrested Hutchinson , and added a charge for resisting arrest when she struggled .
She was scheduled to go to trial today ( Thursday ) on that charge and a charge of cruelty to a police animal , but on Tuesday the prosecutor , Will Porter , decided to drop the charges .
Having watched a video of the event over the weekend , Porter said he had decided that it would be difficult to prove that the defendant ’s conduct had actually changed the dog ’s behavior .
" Most of the time [ in harassment cases ] people would come tell the court what it felt like , " Porter said .
" Dogs ca n’t do that . "
Really ?
Why not put Max on the stand and have Hutchinson make a face at him , sort of like how they always ask witnesses to point at the defendant if they see him or her in the courtroom ?
Let the jury decide .
How many more police dogs have to be stared at in this country before we start taking this kind of thing seriously ?

Cubans celebrated the 81st birthday of their president , Fidel Castro .
Although he has not appeared in public since a stomach operation a year ago , Mr Castro is still nominally in charge of the communist country he has led since a revolution in 1959 .
This makes him the world 's longest - serving living leader .
Indeed , many rulers coming to power through a revolution or coup , like absolute monarchs , are likely to enjoy a lengthy stint in charge .
A few , such as Robert Mugabe , were legitimately elected at some point .
Now , however , most rulers use fraudulent democratic elections as a figleaf for their continued reign .
Home Depot seems to have had a change of heart .
They ’re now unequivocally telling their customers that they will not advertise on Bill O’Reilly ’s show .
Oddly , however , they ’re now also claiming that they never advertised on O’Reilly ’s show .

Good morning ,
Thank you very much for your message .
The Home Depot has a policy that prohibits the running of its advertising on programs that express strong opinions or political views .
Please note that this includes Bill O’Reilly ’s program .
Thank you ,
Ron
Funny , though , that Home Depot already admitted to advertising on O’Reilly ’s show in the hateful email they sent customers just a few days ago – you know , the one where they blamed you for hurting the environment :
Dear C ( me ) , Thank you for contacting The Home Depot Customer Care .
We appreciate you taking the time to forward your concerns regarding The Home Depot ’s sponsorship of Bill O’ Reilly ’s show on FOX .
The Home Depot has a strong passion for being environmentally responsible both in the Company ’s operating principles and in responsible retailing through our industry - leading Eco Options initiative , a program that allows customers to easily identify products that have less of an impact on the environment and empowers them to help make a difference in their own homes .
We have led many initiatives with interest groups to develop standards and set environmental goals for ourselves and suppliers .
Some of these at great expense and sweat equity to the company .
Our advertising campaigns have one simple objective to communicate with audiences in the most effective way possible .
The Company is receptive to many forms and styles of media as we seek a balanced representation of programming to reach our customer base .
Unfortunately campaigns like this one cause us to take time away from our sustainability goals and address a variance of political views .
Sincerely , Atul
Customer Care
Gee , Atul , it seems that your story is changing fast .
Perhaps Home Depot is doing “ run of network ” ads that appear across the FOX networks , with FOX choosing which shows the ads run on .
A lot of companies like to use this kind of advertising to claim that they do n’t advertise on particular shows – it ’s a smoke screen and a lie .
If this is the case here , then Home Depot needs to specifically inform us that they have asked FOX not to run any Home Depot ads on The O’Reilly Factor .
Having said that , Home Depot has some explaining to do if it thinks Hannity is any better than O’Reilly .
FOX , across the board , smears gays , blacks , attacks the environment , and more .
Home Depot needs to dump the hate network now , across the board .

In trying to win , has Dewhurst lost a friend ?
AUSTIN — Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst may have bought some future political advantage this week at the cost of a friendship .
The political gain is with fellow Republicans who want to require that registered voters present photo IDs proving their citizenship before voting .
The friend is Sen. John Whitmire — a Houston Democrat and the longest serving member of the Senate , often referred to as the dean .
He has been a staunch Dewhurst ally and hunting buddy .
Dewhurst , who presides over the Senate , fought to get a voter identification bill to the Senate floor .
Whitmire opposed it , and the dispute turned nasty .
On Tuesday , Whitmire protested when Dewhurst said he missed a vote on bringing the GOP - backed voter ID bill to the floor .
Whitmire said he was " working the floor " but present when the vote was called .
" Right is right , and wrong is wrong , " Whitmire said hitting his desk and cursing for punctuation .
" You do n't have to win this this way . "
Dewhurst threatened to kick Whitmire out of the Senate chamber .
" Dean , you 're going to compose yourself or you are going to leave the floor . "
The motion to debate the bill failed .
Dewhurst added fuel to the fire the next day when he blasted an e-mail across the Capitol saying Whitmire " gamed the voting process , " then tried to make himself the victim .
The tone was highly uncharacteristic for the diplomatic Dewhurst .
The lieutenant governor said staff sent the letter without his approval , and retracted portions of it .
Hot topic on both sides
Voter identification legislation has always been a hot - button issue .
It 's even hotter this year because of Democratic gains in 2006 , concern about illegal immigration and Dewhurst 's political ambition .
He has designs on the governor 's seat , and he has been much more political this session as he tries to shore up support among the Republican base .
Republicans like the voter ID bill because they believe it will weaken Democrats , but can argue that it is a reasonable requirement .
People need identification to board planes , to rent an apartment , to buy Sudafed , they say .
None of those , however , is a constitutional right — voting is .
Republicans say the bill is needed to protect against voter fraud by people who cast ballots using false identification or stolen identity .
Democrats counter that Republicans grossly exaggerate the prevalence of voter fraud .
The Democrats fear that requiring identification will suppress turnout among two key constituencies — low - income minorities and the elderly — because they are more likely to be deterred from voting by additional requirements .
In his letter , Dewhurst cited " independent polls , like one recently conducted by Austin - based Baselice & Associates . "
Mike Baselice is n't exactly independent .
He is Gov. Rick Perry 's pollster and most of his clients are Republicans .
Baselice conducted a poll the first week in April for an anonymous client on another subject .
He says he threw the voter ID question in on his own , because it was a hot topic at the time .
He provided the results to Republicans , who are now using it to support their cause .
The poll found 95 percent of Republicans , 91 percent of independents and 87 percent of Democrats support using photo IDs .
Royal Masset , the former political director of the Republican Party of Texas , who trained Baselice , says it is easy to elicit that kind of response to a poll question .
Recalling Vo-Heflin race
Among Republicans it is an " article of religious faith that voter fraud is causing us to lose elections , " Masset said .
He does n't agree with that , but does believe that requiring photo IDs could cause enough of a dropoff in legitimate Democratic voting to add 3 percent to the Republican vote .
Remember that in the 2005 election contest between Hubert Vo and Talmadge Heflin , Heflin questioned more than 250 votes cast in the state House race .
But a Republican lawmaker who investigated the contest concluded that Heflin produced " no evidence of any intentional voter fraud " that would have affected the outcome .
Vo 's margin narrowed , but he won the election by at least 16 votes .
Democrats maintain that Republicans ' general claims of voter fraud are similarly overstated .
Dewhurst has declared the voter ID bill all but dead this session , but nothing is ever really dead until the deadline for passing bills expires .
That 's next Wednesday .
Let 's see which version of Dewhurst — the diplomat or the partisan — we get in the next few days .

SILICON VALLEY , as the old joke goes , was built on ICs — Indians and Chinese that is , not integrated circuits .
As of the last decennial census , in 2000 , more than half of all the engineers in the valley were foreign - born , and about half of those were either Indian or Chinese — and since 2000 the ratio of Indians and Chinese is reckoned to have gone up steeply .
Understandably , therefore Silicon Valley has strong views on America 's visa regime .
The latest reminder of the power of the “ quota raj ” , as Indians like to call it , came on April 2nd , the day the Citizenship and Immigration Services began receiving applications from employers for this year 's batch of H - 1B visas , a special class of visa that allows highly qualified foreigners such as software programmers to work in America for up to six years .
The number of these is currently capped at 65,000 a year , well down from 195,000 a year in 2003 .
Within hours , 150,000 applications flooded in and the government picked the winners by computerised lottery .
An additional tranche of 20,000 H - 1Bs for graduates from American universities will run out very soon .
As the Harvard Crimson , the university 's daily paper , puts it , many of the foreigners in its class of 2007 have received their “ deportation orders ” .
A lot of this has to do with a political backlash against Indian and other foreign scientists caused by offshoring , the practice of farming out technology operations to firms in places such as India — “ exporting jobs ” in populist jargon .
But the quota actually mostly hurts American firms .
“ There is a skills shortage in Silicon Valley , ” says M.R. Rangaswami , who migrated from Chennai ( then Madras ) in 1976 and now runs the Sand Hill Group , a firm in the valley that advises software companies .
Bill Gates told a Senate panel in March that the H - 1B quota was endangering America 's future and should be abolished .
Senator Edward Kennedy asked Mr Gates whether this might cause a brain drain in poor countries .
AnnaLee Saxenian , a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and author of “ The New Argonauts ” , a book on the subject , argues that the exact opposite is the case .
It might be called brain circulation .
Immigrants , she maintains , tend not to leave a place altogether .
They form networks that , in effect , make Silicon Valley the head office and their home countries the branch offices .
That 's what the Taiwanese and Israelis who came to Silicon Valley in the 1970s and 1980s did , and the Indians and Chinese followed the same pattern .
Thus the Taiwanese built Hsinchu , near Taipei , into a “ silicon sibling ” for manufacturing gadgets dreamed up in California ; the Israelis , with ties to their army , built a transnational security - software industry ; and the Chinese and Indians are now turning Shanghai and Bangalore into new silicon siblings in , respectively , microchips and software .
As a result , the typical start - up firm in Silicon Valley today is a global multinational from its day of incorporation , with entrepreneurs travelling back and forth , hiring talent inside and outside the United States and transferring technology , capital and chutzpah in both directions .
Take Prem Uppaluru , who graduated from the Bombay branch of the elite Indian Institute of Technology in 1975 .
Some 30 % of his class came to Silicon Valley and all have founded technology companies ;
Mr Uppaluru is currently on his fourth , and has just hired 35 people in Silicon Valley and 25 in Bangalore .
More of these immigrant entrepreneurs are now returning home , but without giving up on Silicon Valley , says Sridar Iyengar , a former president of the Indus Entrepreneurs , a predominantly Indian network .
He himself moved back to India in 1997 but keeps his home in Silicon Valley and his green card .
All this could change for the next generation of talented Indians and Chinese , says Mr Iyengar , who is 60 .
His generation typically came with an H - 1B visa , then got a green card and eventually citizenship .
Now , getting just the first is much harder .
At the same time , the quality of life and opportunity at home in India or China has improved spectacularly .
Increasingly , Mr Iyengar , who is an adviser to and investor in several Indian start - ups , is advising young Indians to stay at home .
The Dick Cheney Hooker Disposal Act of 2007
Ladies and gentlemen of the internet , today I would like to introduce a bill for consideration by The Congress of the United States of America .
Please join me in supporting this critical piece of legislation .
In the rough and tumble world of politics a man needs a chance to unwind at the end of the day so he can face tomorrow refreshed and ready to go .
This is especially important when that man is engaged in the stressful task of starting wars and silencing enemies .
Is n't it time to give back to the man who has taken so very much ?
I hope you 'll join me in lobbying Congress to passFull text of this important bill :
110th CONGRESS
1st Session
H. R. 6660
To amend the Department of Hookers and Cheap Cigars Department Act of 1914 , and for other purposes .
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
June 18 , 2007
A BILL
To amend the Department of Hookers and Cheap Cigars Department Act of 1914 , and for other purposes .
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled ,
SECTION 1 . SHORT TITLE .
This Act may be cited as the " The Dick Cheney Hooker Disposal Act of 2007 " .
SEC .
2 . It shall be resolved forthwith that —
( a) Any prostitutes the Vice President of the United States of America , His Honor Richard B. Cheney wishes to dispose of shall have duly deposited into the account relating to her post -use period via her microchip implant a credit of not less than 8,000 U.S. dollars and not more than 1 million ( $ 1,000,000 ) U.S. dollars , plus free shipping in Wyoming .
( b) Definitions -
For purposes of this section —
(1) The term " prostitute " shall be defined as " a woman who for whatever reason has sex with Dick Cheney and is not his wife " and shall be used throughout this bill .
(2) The term " hooker " shall have identical meaning herein .
(3) The term “ pimp ” shall refer to the business associate of a hooker
( c) All prostitutes shall be supplied by Madam Palfrey or a duly appointed representative ( or " Pimp " ) .
SEC .
3 . Hooker disposal in accordance with Hooker Disbursement and Collection Agency ( HDCA ) rules and regulations
( a) All prostitutes must be disposed of in a method befitting the secreting of all evidence of prostitute fucking and killing from the general public .
Since they never read these bills , they 'll never fucking know .
Therefore , all prostitute remains must be remanded to the control of the Chief Deputy of the Hooker Disbursement and Collection Agency ( HDCA ) or his duly appointed representative .
( b) It is resolved that hooker remains must be deposited into —
(1) The cement foundation of new buildings or
(2) Blended with molten steal
( c) So as to ensure no evidence will be found of the Department of Hookers and Cheap Cigars Department Act of 1914 , and all subsequent legislation , including this Act .
(d) Furthermore , it is resolved that Dick Cheney 's hooker disposal is hereby given utmost priority over other hooker disposal requirements , including
(1) The President 's ( POTUS ) Playboy Bunnys Get Fucked Department and related activities , known as Section 69 - G , and
( 2 ) all other hooker disposal priorities .
SEC .
4 . It is further resolved that funding for this act shall —
( a) Be acquired by secretly re-routing funds appropriated to the Faking Unsolicited Concern for Kids , Orphans , Females and Freedom ( FUCKOFF )
Act of 1969 and
( b) From the Central Intelligence Agency ’s ( C.I.A. ) Secret Slush Fund for Hookers and Blow .
You may be wondering if I 'm serious .
You 're damn right I 'm serious .
We live in an age of unprecedented government corruption and corporate malfeasance and few people seem to care .
The point of this admittedly cynical satire to make people think .
In my wildest wet dream this bill would be introduced and even debated on the floor of House of Representatives .
I do n't expect them to pass it ; shit , I 'd be the first to say they should vote against it .
Getting the bill passed is not the point .
I 'd just like to see a member of the House introduce it to make a point about how incredibly corrupt and evil our government has become .
There are so many secret or just oft - ignored parts of the government all running around doing god - knows - what with the trillions of dollars the taxpayers have given them , it 's hard to imagine the government is even aware of what its doing .
Like an octopus with a million tentacles a few must inevitably be up to no good .
A few errant tentacles I can accept but when a man like Dick Cheney takes control of the Octopus ' cranium and controls it so effectively I begin to wonder if maybe corruption is the plan .
Cheney 's deft control of the war machine revealed that corruption is not the exception ; it 's the norm .
And if he 's ordered a prostitute or two ?
Well , maybe reality is more corrupt and decrepit than my darkest nightmares .
Please , join me in supporting a bill that you do n't really support .
It 's a crazy choice for crazy times .

Okay , we linked to the funnybook version on Monday , but what ’s happened to Matt Boyd is more tragic than humorous .
From what I ’ve gathered things were , if not exactly good , then at least no -hard - feelings for Boyd on the part of those that used to be his bosses ; they understood it was a stupid overreaction on the part of people that he worked with , they did n’t personally hold it against him , and they were willing to give him good references .
Couple weeks of unemployment benefits , grab a new job , all good .
Then the cops showed up on his doorstep .
Details are sketchy at this time , but it appears that making a comic about his experience counts as making terroristic threats .
I realize that by this logic , me reporting on the making of a comic that ’s seen as a terroristic threat may count as lending support to terrorists .
If I wake up in Gitmo , tell my wife that I love her , and I ’m sorry I ’m not there to help walk the dog .
In the meantime , the best information appears to be from Rich Stevens ( story on the front page now , here eventually ) ; more on this as it develops .
Edit to add : interview just conducted with Boyd , to run tomorrow .

Howard Kerr talks about BSI 's values >
We are all observing events around the world and thinking of our colleagues and clients in many countries who struggle for equality and human rights .
Our world is challenged by the effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic and social division .
Social injustice across our communities strikes at the very core of both personal and organizational values , and actions which threaten these values cause harm not just to the individuals targeted but to our society in general .
Apparently threatening to take a gun to Hillary Clinton and suggesting we burn down the US Capitol building is okay to post on Bill O’Reilly ’s Web site , but complaining about those terrorist and assassination proposals gets your banned .
Which brings into question just how serious Bill O’Reilly is about the death threats being posted on BillOReilly.com since an attempt to find those threats is cause for being banned .
Where ’s your free speech now , Bill ?
Why are jetBlue and Home Depot insisting on supporting people who seem more concerned about liberals than they are terrorists ?
Perhaps you should ask them .

Computer Architecture Series 第二作のために、日々素材作りを進めているのですが、この作業の間に " binfmt_flat " というオタッキーなモジュールが誕生しました。今日は、このモジュールを使った
" Hello golf " をご紹介しましょう ( 注 : 昨年一世を風靡した ELF golf ではありませんので、あしからず ) 。
初学者の理解を阻む複雑な ELF
皆さんご存じの通り 、PC-UNIX 上における標準のオブジェクトファイルフォーマットは
ELF ( Executable and Linking Format ) ですが、このフォーマットは高機能を追求しているため、内部はかなり複雑な作りになっています。
実は、当初 Computer Architecture Series 第二作のテーマは、この ELF を予定していました。私にしては珍しく、前もって原稿も書き貯めていたのですが、考えた挙げ句に途中でお蔵入りとなってしまった次第、トホホ・・。
ELF の内部構造を理解するためには、アセンブリ言語はもとより、さらに深い機械語レベルの知識が必須となります。具体的には「オペコードマップを元に、アセンブラーとリンカーを自作できる位の腕力」が望ましいのですが、スクリプト言語全盛の時代に、このような時代錯誤の前提を置くわけにはいきません。
そこで、思い切って ELF のテーマは繰り越すことと し( Micro Controller Unit の解説以降を予定 ) 、第二作では基本的な UNIX 環境に関する解説を行うこととしました。基本的かつ重要ではあるけれど、これまで語られることのなかったテーマの数々が登場します。
プログラムからプロセスへ
さて、ファイルイメージとして焼き付けられたプログラムファイルは、execve
システムコールにより、メモリー上のプロセスへと生まれ変わります。
サナギから蝶への完全変体のように、プログラムファイルを鋳型にしたプロセスの生成は、大変興味深く、また好奇心を刺激される現象です。一体どのような仕組みでプロセスは誕生するのでしょうか？
binfmt モジュー ル
Linux カーネルにおいて、プログラムファイルからプロセスを起動する主要処理は、binfmt ( BINary ForMaT ) モジュールが担当しています。ELF
フォーマットであれば binfmt_elf、旧来の a.out フォーマットであれば binfmt_aout がその処理を担当します 。
しかしながら 、binfmt モジュールに関する資料は、皆無に近い状況( Linux では毎度のことですが ) 。linux / Documentation ディレクトリ中に用意されている古い資料は binfmt_misc のみに関するものですし、ネット上の資料 も
Playing with binary formats のように、拡張子に基づいたファイルビューアーの自動起動方法を述べるだけで、肝心の binfmt コア部分に関するものはありません 。
頼りの " Understanding the LINUX KERNEL 3rd Ed. " も、binfmt については軽く言及しているだけで、重要なところがあちこち抜け落ちています。ウッキ〜〜！！
ということで、結局ソースにあたるしかないのですね。幸いなことに、プログラムファイルからプロセス生成に関わるコードは、多くはありません。fs/exec.c , fs/binfmt_*.c および関連するヘッダーファイル群を読み込んでいけば、意外なほど単純な仕組みが明らかになります。
世界最小の実行フォーマット binfmt_flat
で、この解析結果を元に、世界一シンプルな実行可能ファイルフォーマット binfmt_flat のモジュールを作ってみました。
フォーマットの仕様ですが、.rodata セクションは必要ないので削除。.bss
セクション、そんな高級なもの必要ないので却下。ついでに .data セクションもありません。開始アドレスもゼロ番地固定。実は、.text セクションも・・ないんです。
「 なんじゃそりゃ？！」と言われそうですが、昔はセクションなんて気の利いた代物はなかったのであります。CPU
の前には、コードもデータも全て平等。だから、" flat " 。
binfmt_flat フォーマットに要求される唯一の約束事は、先頭２バイトに " EB 00 " が位置すること。これは 、OMAGIC における " 0407 " をもじった、x86 版の " jmp short " 命令コードです。つまり、binfmt_flat フォーマットの 「 ヘッダーデータはわずか２バイト」ということになります。
さらば、ELF ！
何もしないプログラム exit
手始めに、最も簡単なプログラムファイル exit.asm を用意します。crt ファイルとリンカースクリプトを用意すれば GNU C コンパイラも使えるのですが、今日は見通しの良い
Netwide assembler でコンパクトに片付けてしまいましょう。なお、AT&T syntax の gas は、コードが美しくないので却下 。
bits 32 ; operand / address size is 32 bits jmp short _start ; file signature ( EB 00 ) _start : mov eax , 1 ; one means " _exit " system call mov ebx , 123 ; exit status is 123 int 0x80
先頭の " jmp short _start " 命令は、file signature ( EB 00 に展開される ) を兼ねています。残りは、教科書的な内容ですね。レジスタ指定を介して、Linux の _exit システムコールを直接呼び出しています。EBX レジスタ に 123 を指定しているので、親プロセスであるシェルには終了ステータスコードとして 123 が返されます 。
それでは、アセンブリソースファイルから binfmt_flat 実行可能ファイルを生成します。
$ nasm exit.asm $ ls -l exit - rw - r--r-- 1 wataru wataru 14 2007-04-12 01:51 exit $ hexdump - C exit 00000000 eb 00 b8 01 00 00 00 bb 7 b 00 00 00 cd 80 |?.?....?{...?.| 0000000e
実は 、NASM には binfmt_flat フォーマットの出力オプションなどありません 。NASM はデフォルトでバイナリーフォーマットで出力しますから、これでOKなのです。
ファイルサイズは驚きの１４バイト。exit ファイルの内容を見ると、確かに先頭に EB 00 が位置しています。全体を逆アセンブルしてみましょう。
$ objdump - b binary -m i386 - D exit exit : file format binary Disassembly of section .data : 0000000000000000 < .data > : 0 : eb 00 jmp 0x2 2 : b8 01 00 00 00 mov $ 0x1 , %eax 7 : bb 7 b 00 00 00 mov $ 0x7 b , %ebx c : cd 80 int $ 0x80
このような時は、objdump の - D オプションを使います( - b , - m オプションも定石ですので、覚えておきましょう)。逆アセンブルリストが、みっともない
AT&T syntax に置き換わっていますが、意図通りのコードが生成されています。高級言語やスクリプト言語にはない、この「 一対一」の感覚は、アセンブリ言語ならではですね。
exit の実行前に 、binfmt_falt モジュールをコンパイルし、カーネルにモジュールとして組み込みます。Linux カーネ ル 2.6 環境は複雑で初学者には向いていないため、書籍の作業環境には敢えて
Debian sarge を採用しています 。
$ gcc-2.95 -c - Wall -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__
- O binfmt_flat.c $ sudo insmod binfmt_flat .o
最後に、exit ファイルに実行可能属性を付与して、シェルから呼び出します。
$ chmod +x exit $ ./ exit ; echo $ ?
123 $
わずか、１４バイトのプログラムファイルがプロセスの命を与えられ、立派に動いています。これぞ、モジュールプログラミングの醍醐味と言えるでしょう。
Hello golf のはじまり、はじまり・ ・
それでは、お題目 の Hello golf を始めましょう 。NASM 版 Hello , world !
プログラム hello.asm は次のようになります。
bits 32 ; operand / address size is 32 bits jmp short _start ; file signature ( EB 00 ) _start : mov eax , 4 ; EAX = " write " system call mov ebx , 1 ; EBX = STDOUT decsriptor mov ecx , msg ; ECX = message address mov edx , mend - msg ; EDX = message length int 0x80 mov eax , 1 ; EAX = " _exit " system call mov ebx , 123 ; EBX = exit status ( 123 ) int 0x80 msg : db ' Hello , world ! ' db 10 mend :
こちらも、教科書的な内容です。先ほどの exit.asm に、標準出力への write システムコールを付加しただけですね。アセンブルしてみましょう。
$ nasm hello.asm $ chmod +x hello $ wc -c hello 50 hello
来ました来ました 、 「 ヘッダー２バイトの威力」により、最初から難なく５０バイトを叩き出しています。ホンマに動くの？
$ ./hello ; echo $ ?
Hello , world !
123
ちゃんと動きましたが、まだまだ油断はできません。菊やんの雑記帳では、ELF
でありながら５８という恐るべきスコアを叩きだしています。
もう少し、刻んでみましょう。
レジスタ即値転送命令の無駄
hello の逆アセンブルリストを見直し、コードのどこに無駄が隠されているかチェックします。
$ objdump - b binary -m i386 - D hello hello : file format binary Disassembly of section .data : 0000000000000000 < .data > : 0 : eb 00 jmp 0x2 2 : b8 04 00 00 00 mov $ 0x4 , %eax 7 : bb 01 00 00 00 mov $ 0x1 , %ebx c : b9 24 00 00 00 mov $ 0x24 , %ecx 11 : ba 0e 00 00 00 mov $ 0xe , %edx 16 : cd 80 int $ 0x80 18 : b8 01 00 00 00 mov $ 0x1 , %eax 1d : bb 7 b 00 00 00 mov $ 0x7 b , %ebx 22 : cd 80 int $ 0x80 24 : 48 dec %eax 25 : 65 gs 26 : 6 c insb ( %dx ) , %es : ( %edi ) 27 : 6 c insb ( %dx ) , %es : ( %edi ) 28 : 6 f outsl %ds :( %esi ) , ( %dx ) 29 : 2 c 20 sub $ 0x20 , %al 2b : 77 6 f ja 0x9c 2d : 72 6 c jb 0x9 b 2f : 64 21 0a and %ecx , %fs : ( %edx )
このリスト中で目立つのは、１や４などの定数をレジスターに格納する際(レジスタへの即値転送命令)に、５バイトも消費している点です。ここを工夫してみましょう。
xor 命令とバイト転送命令の活 用
bits 32 ; operand / address size is 32 bits global _start ; intended for ELF version jmp short _start ; file signature ( EB 00 ) _start : xor eax , eax xor ebx , ebx xor ecx , ecx xor edx , edx mov al , 4 ; EAX = " write " system call mov bl , 1 ; EBX = STDOUT decsriptor mov cl , msg ; ECX = message address mov dl , mend - msg ; EDX = message length int 0x80 xor eax , eax xor ebx , ebx mov al , 1 ; EAX = " _exit " system call mov bl , 123 ; EBX = exit status ( 123 ) int 0x80 msg : db ' Hello , world ! ' db 10 mend :
hello2.asm では、アセンブリ野郎にはおなじみの xor 命令によるゼロクリアを使っています。続く、バイト転送命令も８０８６野郎には常識の手段。x86 は 64 ビットへ進化を遂げようとも、内部では未だに基本論理命令やバイト転送命令が最短コードなのです。
$ nasm hell o2.asm $ wc -c hell o2 44 hell o2 $ objdump - b binary -m i386 - D hell o2 hell o2 : file format binary Disassembly of section .data : 0000000000000000 < .data > : 0 : eb 00 jmp 0x2 2 : 31 c0 xor %eax , %eax 4 : 31 db xor %ebx , %ebx 6 : 31 c9 xor %ecx , %ecx 8 : 31 d2 xor %edx , %edx a : b0 04 mov $ 0x4 , %al c : b3 01 mov $ 0x1 , %bl e : b1 1e mov $ 0x1e , %cl 10 : b2 0e mov $ 0xe , %dl 12 : cd 80 int $ 0x80 14 : 31 c0 xor %eax , %eax 16 : 31 db xor %ebx , %ebx 18 : b0 01 mov $ 0x1 , %al 1a : b3 7b mov $ 0x7 b , %bl 1 c : cd 80 int $ 0x80 1e : 48 dec %eax 1f : 65 gs 20 : 6 c insb ( %dx ) , %es : ( %edi ) 21 : 6 c insb ( %dx ) , %es : ( %edi ) 22 : 6 f outsl %ds :( %esi ) , ( %dx ) 23 : 2 c 20 sub $ 0x20 , %al 25 : 77 6 f ja 0x96 27 : 72 6 c jb 0x95 29 : 64 21 0a and %ecx , %fs : ( %edx )
xor 命令とバイト転送命令はそれぞ れ２ バイトとなり、hello2 のサイズは４４バイトとなりました。こうなったら、意地でも４０バイトを切りたいところ。
hello3.asm
もしも、プロセス起動時に EAX , EBX , ECX , EDX がゼロクリアされていることが保証されていれば、xor 命令が不要になりますので、かなりコードを節約できます。少しズルイ気もしますが、binfmt_flat モジュールに手を加え、プロセス開始時
EAX = EBX = ECX = EDX = 0 となるようにしてみました。
" 神様 " には、こういう事も許されるのであります。
bits 32 ; operand / address size is 32 bits ; binfmt_flat guarantess that " EAX = EBX = ECX = EDX = 0 " jmp short _start ; file signature ( EB 00 ) _start : push eax push ebx mov al , 4 ; EAX = " write " system call mov bl , 1 ; EBX = STDOUT decsriptor mov cl , msg ; ECX = message address mov dl , mend - msg ; EDX = message length int 0x80 pop ebx pop eax mov al , 1 ; EAX = " _exit " system call mov bl , 123 ; EBX = exit status ( 123 ) int 0x80 msg : db ' Hello , world ! ' db 10 mend :
xor 命令がなくなると、随分スッキリしましたね。write システムコール実行中に EAX , EBX レジスタの内容が変化すると困るので、コードサイズの小さい
PUSH / POP 命令で保存/復活させています。
さて、そのサイズはいかに？
$ nasm hello3.asm $ wc -c hello3 36 hello3 $ chmod +x hello3 $ ./hello3 ; echo $ ?
Hello , world !
123
遂に、スコ ア３６ の Hello , world !
が誕生しました。
閑話休題
思わず脱線してしまいましたが、binfmt_flat モジュールは
Golf をやるために作成したのではありません( 意識はしましたが)。最も単純なフラットファイルフォーマットまで遡り、これを発展させていく過程を通じて、なぜセクション構造が必要になったのか、その意味を読者の方々に実体験して頂くことが目的です。
GNU 開発ツールは強力なセクションコントロール能力を持っていますが、その力を最大限に発揮させるためには、基本の理解が不可欠だと私は考えています。
Retaliatory massacres by gunmen and bombers linked to rival Muslim sects have left more than 130 people dead across Iraq over the last two days , the latest casualties of what some politicians now are calling an undeclared civil war .
At least 57 Iraqis were killed Tuesday and scores more injured when a suicide bomber lured a group of day laborers to his minivan with the promise of work before setting off explosives .
The bombing in Kufa rained blood , burnt debris and charred body parts on a small market across the street from the Muslim bin Aqil mosque , the main platform for radical Shiite cleric and militia leader Muqtada Sadr .
Since the beginning of May , attacks by Sunni Arab and Shiite Muslims have claimed the lives of more than 6,000 Iraqi civilians , according to a United Nations study and Iraqi police reports .

The Kufa blast , coming on the heels of mass killings and bombings attributed to Sadr ’s Al Mahdi militia and its Sunni Arab enemies , brought the battle to the Shiite cleric ’s doorstep , igniting fears of a fresh wave of reprisal killings .
“ The message is clear , and the message confirms the sectarian differences , ” said Fadhil Sharih , a leader of the Sadr movement .
“ It seems clear that it ’s been moving toward the direction of civil war . ”
U.S. and Iraqi government leaders have argued that the 150,000 - strong foreign troop presence has kept the country from descending into full - scale civil war .
But many Iraqi officials fear the threshold has been crossed .
“ What is happening in Iraq is a disaster and a tragedy , ” Adnan Dulaimi , a Sunni Arab leader , said in an interview .

“ It ’s bloodshed and killing of the innocents , killing the elderly and women and children .
It ’s mass killings .
It ’s nothing less than an undeclared civil war . ”
Many members of Iraq ’s political class spoke gravely of the massacres and bombings of the last few days , even as two U.S. Cabinet officials visiting Baghdad ’s heavily fortified Green Zone this week touted Iraq as a potential bonanza for private investors .
The Iraqi Islamic Party , the largest Sunni Arab political group , warned Tuesday that “ Iraq is witnessing a grave escalation in violence , ” and it called on Iraqis “ to return to their senses instead of slipping into the abyss . ”
The surge in violence has terrified residents of Baghdad and other mixed Sunni and Shiite areas .
The Baghdad airport has been flooded with Iraqis of modest means seeking to escape even temporarily the country ’s upswing in sectarian slayings .

According to a U.N. study based on Health Ministry statistics , 2,669 Iraqi civilians were killed in May and 3,149 were killed in June .
And this month , the violence appears to be accelerating , particularly in the Baghdad area that is the target of a sweeping security crackdown aimed at quelling the violence .
U.S. and Iraqi troops launched the sweep , to great fanfare , after a visit in mid-June by President Bush .
“ Things are getting worse , ” said Mahmoud Othman , a Kurdish lawmaker .
Even those who hesitate to call Iraq ’s sectarian violence a civil war have begun saying that defusing the situation will require the international mechanisms used to mediate previous ethnic , religious and political conflicts in Central America , the former Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka .
“ I start to feel the need to say that there is a civil war , ” said Salim Abdullah Jabouri , a Sunni politician , “ in order to borrow the tools and solutions of past civil wars to apply them here , and to call upon the international community to deal with Iraq ’s problems on this basis . ”

The latest cycle of violence began with the July 8 bombing of a small Shiite mosque in the Jihad neighborhood of southwest Baghdad .
Shiite militiamen took to the streets the next day , pulling Sunnis from their homes and cars and executing them on the spot .
A string of bombings targeting Shiite mosques and markets followed .
In the morgue , the bodies of Sunnis piled up , felled with single bullets to the head , apparently by Shiite death squads .

And in the religiously mixed Dora section of Baghdad , Sunni gunmen began stopping cars filled with Shiite mourners headed to the cemetery in the Shiite holy city of Najaf , pulling out the occupants and killing them .
In apparent retaliation , three Sunni Arab members of the Ghereir tribe were abducted Sunday night and slain .
Their burned and mutilated bodies were found in a pickup truck near Musayyib .
Hours later , dozens of gunmen flocked into the Shiite town center of Mahmoudiya , killing 42 civilians as they sought to flee the well - coordinated force , officials said .
Later Monday night , the bodies of 32 Sunni Arab men were found in Baghdad .
The discovery was followed by Tuesday ’s attack in Kufa .

“ I got out of my car to drink some water , ” said Sadik Kadhim Ali , a 30 - year - old Shiite farmer being treated at the nearby hospital in Najaf for multiple shrapnel wounds to his legs from the minivan blast .
“ The car exploded .
Many people were killed , and there were body parts all over . ”
Hours later , police discovered 14 more bodies near the mixed Mahmoudiya area .
The broken glass mingles with specks of human blood .
The corpses and anger mount .
Each attack , played over and over on satellite television channels controlled by political parties with sectarian agendas , is magnified across the airwaves .
“ It is actually a civil war , ” said Ayad Samaraie , a leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party .
Advertisement
“ It is action and reaction .
And it is increasing day after day . ”
Iraq ’s elected political leaders have floated several plans to contain the fighting , among them the Baghdad security plan , which includes new checkpoints and curfews and a requirement that Iraqis own no more than one automatic weapon and keep it at home .
That crackdown has been declared a failure by all but the most strident supporters of the current government .
Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and his aides also continue to promote a reconciliation plan meant to draw at least some of the Sunni insurgents away from the gun and bring Shiite militias under the authority of government security forces .

In recent days , Iraqi politicians have proposed joint neighborhood watch groups made up of loyalists of both Shiite and Sunni political parties , in an attempt to spur dialogue and prevent reprisal killings .
“ We ’re talking about the security situation on the ground in different neighborhoods , ” said Haider Abadi , a lawmaker and member of Maliki ’s Islamic Dawa Party .
“ Without having understanding and cooperation on the ground , we ’ll be drawn into civil war . ”
Still , even Sunni and Shiite political leaders , who meet frequently in the Green Zone , are far from an accord and often seem to talk past one another in discussing solutions for ending the escalating violence .
Shiites continue to heap most of the blame on loyalists of former President Saddam Hussein and takfiris , or Sunni Arab extremists , many of them from other countries .
Sunnis contend that organized Shiite gunmen in the government security forces , perhaps trained by neighboring Iran , are instigating the violence .

“ Elements inside the government are not in agreement , ” Othman said .
“ Some people call a group terrorist and others say they are the resistance .
Some say the problem is Saddamists ; others say , no , the problem is militias . ”
Unbridled lawlessness continued elsewhere .
On Tuesday , gunmen in Iraqi army uniforms robbed a bank in west Baghdad , making off with about $ 1 million in Iraqi currency .
Clashes also broke out in the southern city of Basra between Sadr ’s followers and British soldiers .
A Mahdi army official said at least four Iraqis were killed .
Five Iraqi police officers were killed by a roadside bomb near Hawija , a Sunni Arab city near the ethnically contested city of Kirkuk .

In Baqubah , gunmen killed a police officer on his way to work .

BOOK BANNED IN AMERICA WHILE TROOPS DIE FOR FREEDOM April 4 , 2003 -- 1:05 am PST
NewsWithViews.com LAS VEGAS , NV -- Irwin Schiff is a well known author with over 500,000 books in print about the economy and the income tax .
He is also now amongst the few who have had a book banned by the U.S. Government .
On March 19 , 2003 , Federal Judge Lloyd George ordered Schiff to stop selling his book " The Federal Mafia " which has been in print for over 13 years .
According to Schiff the Federal Government is using the American people 's preoccupation with the war in Iraq as an opportunity to squelch freedom here at home .
Mr Schiff says , " The 1st Amendment is designed so people can have opinions different from the government and there is no legal basis whatsoever for banning my book .
Its all contrived , it 's bull ***t .
The government is banning the book because the information is accurate and correct . "
With the exception of the Las Vegas Review Journal , there has been very limited press about this book banning .
Mr. Schiff attributes this to the timing of the government 's actions .
He said , " The reason there have n't been more articles is that the government banned the book the day the war broke out .
A number of people have already told me they wanted to do material but because of the war they could n't .
For example , Alan Combs , of Hannity and Combs , said he could n't believe they banned my book and that he would love to do something , but they were really pressed because of the war .
I really believe the reason they issued their restraining order on the day they did was so the war would cover it up .
If there was no war going on , this would be a major story throughout the country .
Also , it 's fear of an IRS audit that keeps the media in line to a large extent . "
Mr. Schiff was asked to explain why a book that had been in print and circulating freely for over 13 years was suddenly banned .
He replied , " The answer is easy .
Within the last 2 months I started advertising nationally .
My ads were on major stations .
For instance , in L.A. I was on station 97.1 with Howard Stern and Tom Leicus .
I was also on the Michael Savage show two times a day .
Until this year I did n't advertise nationally , and my business really picked up .
Businessmen were hearing my commercial , calling me , and buying my book .
The book is very persuasive ; it was becoming increasingly more popular . "
According to Schiff 's website ( www.paynoincometax.com), Judge George 's order also bars Schiff from lecturing on the Income Tax .
Mr. Schiff was asked if his free speech rights were being violated .
" Absolutely " said Irwin .
" This is a pure violation of my 1st .
Amendment rights .
I have been doing a radio show on KLAV for the last seven years .
They got a call from the FCC lawyer telling them not to let me on .
I told KLAV that I would n't advertise my book , I just wanted to explain to my audience how my book was banned , and wanted the audience to know they did n't even take any testimony .
The Judge did n't even look at the book .
But apparently KLAV is so intimidated by the IRS , they would n't honor my contract with them . "
Irwin Schiff 's books also include The Great Income Tax Hoax and How Anyone Can Stop Paying Income Tax .
Mr. Schiff was asked why only The Federal Mafia was banned but not his other books .
He replied , " The reason they donï¿½t like The Federal Mafia is because it provides a method whereby the public can avoid paying income tax without running the risk of being charged criminally .
The other books expose the illegal collection of income taxes but donï¿½t provide the method to stop paying . "
According to Schiff the banning of his book may be a first in American History .
He stated , " This has never happened before , " said Schiff .
" This is prior restraint .
Never to my knowledge has a book on economics and taxes been banned .
The only books that have been banned were primarily pornographic , like Tropic of Cancer .
Never before has a book been banned primarily because the government did n't agree with what was written .
Americans should be shouting from the rooftops .
If the government can do this , the Constitution is really dead .
People should go to my website and download a letter to the editor and send it off .
They shut me down because they do n't like what I say .
The minute the government can shut you down because they do n't like what you say , it 's all over : that 's the mark of a police state .
People should write their Congressmen . "
Schiff 's final statement was , " As U.S. forces seek to bring democracy and freedom to Iraq , the U.S. government is seeking to eliminate it here . " ï¿½ 2003 - NewsWithViews.com - All Rights Reserved Sign Up For Free E-Mail Alerts

On the surface of it , I ’m a natural candidate to upgrade to one of the latest HD DVD formats : I have an extensive and ever - growing DVD collection , and I have a pretty decent HD TV and sound system .
So it would be logical for me to take the next step — upgrade to either Blu - Ray or HD - DVD .
But I ’m just not going to do it , not yet , and maybe not ever .
I ’m also guessing that I ’m not alone .
Here ’s why :
Greetings Diggers :
And congratulations on crashing my server .
I am Britain ’s sweariest science writer , and I ’d like to see any one of you beat this in the British Medical Journal .
I write about pseudoscience in the media , quackery and health scares , like here on TV nutritionist Dr Gillian McKeith PhD , and here in my angry geek manifesto .
When I went to meet the editorial policy / legal people at the BBC , the first thing I wanted to know , as you can well imagine , was this : which swear words am I allowed to use ?
I was shown a ranked list of rudeness .
It was every bit as entertaining as I had hoped , but to my disappointment , there was no possibility of removing this fabulous document from the room .
I do n’t like to paint too much of a melodramatic picture , but the offending piece of paper was physically removed from my hand ( I think they had the idea that I would scan it , post it on my blog , and write an article about it ) .
Anyway , I mentioned this to someone else from the BBC at a party recently : she sent me a copy this morning , and as you can see , I have indeed scanned it and posted it on my blog .
Disappointingly the list turned out to be from a report which is freely available in the public domain here , but that does n’t stop it being almost as funny as I remember .
Ooh , and in case you forgot : Positive Internet are gods .
Elaine Meinel Supkis
DeVaul , one of the readers of this blog , sent me a photocopy of the famous case , Juilliard v. Greenman which was an 1884 Supreme Court case which opened the barn doors for a Federal bank to issue fiat paper currency .
Since this is the week the Federal Reserve which was launched by really rich men at a secret meeting offshore in 1913 , issues its annual reports , it is time to talk about the Consitution , money and why we have a political economy that is destroying America 's economic future in the name of quick profits for the top 1 % of the nation and cheap prices for the working class .
On May 31 , 1878 , the lower courts in New York held that certificates issued by the Army during the Civil War were legal tender and could be passed around as if it were gold coin and it would carry the face value of gold on redemption but this was all false since the inflation caused by the war had significantly reduced the value of these bills handed out by the US Army and so when a manufacturer tried to use them in lieu of coinage , the man selling the cotton wanted payment in currency and not a goverment IOU of indeterminant value .
Namely , due to the war between the states , hard coins were gaining in value and paper IOUs issued by the government were always dropping in value .
This situation is common in time of war .
This week , the Federal Reserve released their annual report which has lots of interesting data hidden in the lists of numbers that have little commentary attached .
The door to a fiat currency was first opened by the Supreme Court in 1884 but the consequences of all this was n't felt until on the very doorstep of the first of the global Great Wars : WWI .
Namely , there was a long political struggle between the believers in gold currency , the silver fanatics and of course , the manufacturers who wanted paper money because then the sky is the limit .
This was an early form of ' carry trade ' whereby industrialists would try to use the paper script as the face amount when paying for commodity volumes .
Presidential races were bedevilled by this debate over gold coins versus paper money .
The Confederacy published paper money , the one photographed here says the Confederacy will pay the bearer of this note issued on February 17 , 1864 , TWO YEARS after a ' peace treaty is signed ' , namely , if and when there is victory and the Confederacy triumphs , THEN the holder of this $ 10 paper can collect this amount in gold ( talk about fantasy ! ) .
Of course , these pieces of paper became worthless when General Robert E. Lee handed over his sword and surrendered .
But the Union had many of these bonds all over the place and all were similiar , namely , after 2 years or so , one was supposed to get gold in return only there was n't any gold at all .
The Supreme Court decided unilaterally that these pieces of paper if issued by the winning side in a war , were ' money ' and had to be accepted at face value .
One justice was so outraged , he wrote a long objection to this ruling , one that gold bugs to this day refer to :
Justice Field dissented on this important case that seemed to be so trivial on the surface : From the Supreme Court 's home page :
From the decision of the court I see only evil likely to follow .
There have been times within the memory of all of us when the legal - tender notes of the United States were not exchangeable for more than one - half of their nominal value .
The possibility of such depreciation will always attend paper money .
This inborn infirmity no mere legislative declaration can cure .
If congress has the power to make the notes a legal tender and to pass as money or its equivalent , why should not a sufficient amount be issued to pay the bonds of the United States as they nature ?
Why pay interest on the millions of dollars of bonds now due when congress can in one day make the money to pay the principal ?
And why should there be any restraint upon unlimited appropriations by the government for all imaginary schemes of public improvement , if the printing - press can furnish the money that is needed for them ?
Click on all images of money to enlarge .
Here is a ' Fractional Dollar ' from 1874 : the USA Treasury kept printing these long after the Civil War ended .
This is what that case is all about , this sort of script .
Quite .
He goes through the long and awful history of paper money which always ends up being used to wage wars and thus , inflated out of value rapidly .
Throughout the then - short history of paper writs , bankruptcy always followed the use of paper money like a baby calf trails after a milch kuh .
I was curious to see if the Federal Reserve which was launched right on the eve of WWI , did it do the usual money printing to enable wars ?
I know that right off the bat , the US goverment began to issue certificates of silver deposits .
I have in my possession a real , bonafide 1899 Silver Certificate for $ 1 .
" This certifies that there has been deposited in the Treasury of the United States of America , ONE SILVER DOLLAR . "
In other words , the silver dollar was supposedly safe and sound in the Treasury 's care and the paper represented it .
Alas , this fiction was soon shown to be fake !
The bank runs that announce the beginning of depressions or great collapses always features fearful holders of these certificates demanding GOLD OR SILVER COINS .
People looking at stories of these events today think the banks ran out of paper money .
This is silly .
Banks NEVER run out of paper money !
Even when the technophiles of Germany ran up the biggest inflation printing race ever , they still could keep up with the inflation they created by simply adding more and more zeros .
This can go to infinity !
What the good people rushing to banks in all the bank runs in history have been people anxious to convert paper or tulip bulbs into gold or silver !
And this is strictly limited !
And when there is a run and there is no gold or silver , only tulips or paper , then there is a panic .
A bad panic .
And lots and lots of people die in the aftermath .
To see the numbers better , I used the basic statistics at their webpage , The Federal Reserve 's Annual Report : Lucky for me , they provide the data going back to day one !
Turning this into a series of graphs , the fact that a government can use paper money to wage war is most striking !
Each of these graphs have a different way of tracking the money .
Since the amount rises rapidly , to show each era clearly , I used the same relative scale but each era involved 10X more money than the earlier eras which is why each graph starts near the bottom with everything compressed .
The inflation of paper money has been very great indeed and the peaks are all involved with waging wars .
The smallness of banking reserves is obvious at the very beginning : the Federal Reserve has a vanishingly small money pot !
But from 1916 to 1920 , it literally shoots to the heavens .
12X over only 4 years .
This is 3X higher each year !
Because the new Federal Reserve was created magically via a conspiracy of the nation 's top money men seeking some way of creating money for themselves , they had to promise they would not inflate the currency madly and would anchor it to gold reserves which were to be kept at Fort Knox .
Due to the Alaskan gold rush , there was a lot more gold available and everyone thought keeping it safe in Fort Knox and not letting it cirulate but to use certificates that said , ' Pay the bearer in GOLD ' would keep the paper money from inflating rapidly .
This was hopeless .
Right off the bat , there was great inflation .
We can see the timelag between issuing of these certificates and the war 's progress .
Of course , the printers could n't see what would happen next so of course , they overshot their goals and a lot of equity was now available to slosh around within the economy .
In a frazzle , the rich men running the Federal Reserve scheme backpeddled rapidly especially when they saw what was happening in Germany and Britain .
The German inflation really spooked them badly so they clamped down on production of dollars starting with 1922 .
This caused great problems so they upped the money production which simply created a huge asset bubble as everyone rushed to move along these ' free money ' certificates !
So in late 1928 , the Federal conspiritors suddenly strangled the money making and we got the Great Depression .
Roosevelt strongarmed them into releasing some money when he was elected but we can see how grudgingly they did this .
Here is a gold certificate .
The runs of the banks in 1933 were ' fixed ' by simply declaring these notes to be FAKE .
They could not be used to demand gold .
In none of the old bills I own from before 1933 does anyone of them have ' In God We Trust ' on them .
The addition of this line when faith in the Federal Reserve was badly shaken was to give the whole business of fiat certificates some sort of faith and authority .
My grandfather taught me to be suspicious of all this because he got stuck with these gold and silver certificates that were made ipso - facto via government fiat , worthless as far as trust is concerned .
I also have from family members who went to war , a parcel of gold certificates from the government of the Philippines and Nationalist China all of which became worthless due to wars , of course .
If one loses one 's country , it is hard to pretend the paper has any value just as the Confederacy discovered .
We can see from these charts how , starting with Germany 's invasion of Poland , the money machine was unleashed to pay for WWII .
It climbed as fast as a rocket .
The Fed slowed down a tad after the war and we had a recession but then the Korean war and the Cold War broke out and off it took to the skies .
For paper money always=war .
This chart starts when I was born : 1950 .
The money machine was set at only $ 250 million .
Eisenhower was very conservative and he tried to keep costs down and he shut down the hopeless Korean war and kept things under control .
For example , the imperialists of France and England wanted him to help them suppress the natives of their former colonies and he refused and even used money to force them to back down .
Thus , India , Egypt and others won freedom and became sovereign nations .
But not Vietnam , for example .
Here is a chart from the Big Picture showing how coins rise in value as the dollar drops .
Again , war makes the printing presses roll .
As the long , disasterous , stupid Vietnam War ground on , money was printed with reckless abandon .
We passed one warning sign after another .
For example , the value of the minerals in our coins greatly surpassed the value on the face !
People like me began to hoard silver coins and use them as raw material .
So the government , just like in 1933 when they ceased honoring their gold certificates , made it illegal to turn a quarter into 65 ¢ by melting it down !
The coins were rapidly debased by using cheap metals .
And the destruction of the dollar continued .
I note on this graph when each destructive event happened .
None of this stopped the military madness !
The sky was the limit and the whole point of the Constitution whereby the goverment is to be HINDERED from going to war via all sorts of restrictions , the one thing our Founding Fathers feared were foreign adventures that would bankrupt America --- this is obvious .
They failed to protect us from the madness of our own leaders who will merrily print money for war forever if they could .
From 1982 to 1994 , the Fed tried to keep things at an even keel but even then , when we had Gulf War I , there was a blip upwards .
In 1994 , Greenspan decided to up the ante and the money took off .
In the Great Asian Currency Crisis which I suspect was created by the Bank of Japan so they could kill the yen , the interest earned by the Federal Reserves collapsed suddenly to ZERO .
At no point in the history of the Fed has this happened .
It is very significant because usually the numbers try to track each other .
I confess I have no idea what this means but the fact that it coincides with that event makes me very suspicious .
Of course , from 1980 to 2006 , the Fed 's numbers have shot up from slightly more than $ 10,000,000,0000 to around $ 40,000,000,000 .
It quadrupled in only 26 years .
One thing is obvious , the production of money is roaring ahead even if there are temporary drops .
I read in the business pages people wondering where all this money sloshing around the world 's economies is coming from .
Well ... DUH .
Ask Bernanke and his ilk .
Ask the damn Bank of Japan .
And I will also note that the money machine turned on not on 9/11 but the summer of 2003 with the invasion of Iraq .
It is shooting up because of that , as per usual .
From Market Watch :
Although there has been anxiety in financial markets all week about inflation , the Federal Reserve does not have an itchy trigger finger to hike rates , an expert on inflation said Friday .
Instead , inflation has been like a lumpy chair in which one can't get comfortable .
Core consumer price inflation increased 2 % year - over - year in April , making it the first time in 14 months that core prices have been inside the Fed 's unofficial target zone of 1 % to 2 % .
See full story .
In addition , the core CPI over the last three months has risen only 1.9 % .
" If the Fed looks at where inflation rates are , while they are not going to leap for joy , they certainly are about where the Fed has a right to hope they would be .
But obviously the Fed is not only looking where we are , but where we are going .
I would say right now there is a lot of uncertainty , " said Don Ratajczak , an expert on inflation and an economic consultant to Morgan Keegan .
Worries about growth are diminishing , wage pressures are possibly building up and the dollar has been weak .
A lumpy chair ?
Maybe Bernanke should be put in an Iron Maiden and get some holes poked in himself .
And the fake inflation numbers piss me off .
If the price of gasoline goes up for six weeks , that is one thing .
But the price of energy has climbed steeply for going on 5 years now !
And this has either raised prices since then or if they are dropping like with Japanese cars and Chinese goods then this is still inflation , the trade deficits should be thrown into the calculations so that if we are importing to hide inflation , then this should be revealed in these numbers by simply adding this deficit to the inflation figures !
Since we ran up nearly ONE TRILLION in red ink trade last year , then this trillion should be added to the inflation figures .
Then we see reality .
Only they wo n't do this because they have a vested interest in hiding the inflation THEY are creating by printing money like crazy .
We know the inflation rate is over 5 % .
This is the rate the Feds are charging for the money they are printing .
So to speak .
From the Wall Street Journal :
The South Korean won has risen 10 % against the U.S. dollar since the start of 2005 , appreciating more than any other Asian currency and causing problems for the country 's export - oriented economy .
The currency 's strength forces South Korean companies to raise prices of their products or cut into profit margins .
Major manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. in the past two years have seen their price advantage against competitors erode , operating profits tumble and stock prices decline .
All over the earth , bankers are raising rates because all of them are printing money and this emphatically includes the Bank of Japan who ships this out so inflation is hidden even as they amass the world 's # 2 largest FOREX funds by hoarding dollars so the yen can look weaker than it really should be .
This global money moving game is not only rigged , it is explosively dangerous because the players hate each other and are looking to do something nasty at some point .
Far from keeping this going forever , they track the money carefully and either bide their time or bite their nails with fear .
From the WSJ article :
For example , a shipbuilder that takes a $ 100 million order today for a ship delivered in 2010 may receive a $ 10 million down payment from the buyer and then hedge the other $ 90 million .
It does this by offering to pay a bank in 2010 the $ 90 million if the bank will at that time give the shipbuilder today 's equivalent value in won , or about 83.4 billion won .
The bank then will go to the foreign - currency market and obtain 83.4 billion won , which it will hold in an account earmarked for the shipbuilder .
The act of acquiring won today creates demand that raises the value of the currency .
And the rising value of the won reinforces shipbuilders ' desire to hedge and protect their future revenue .
" This is a vicious circle being created , with the expectation that the won will become stronger causing it to happen , " says Hong Sun-young , an economist at the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul .
But he does n't blame the shipbuilders , saying they are engaging in " very rational behavior . "
Everyone is being rational and looking out for me , myself and I .
But not all players are blind to what is going on .
And when we couple open door trade with currency games run by various banks that are run by secretive individuals who have their own agendas and some of these are quite nasty , we get constant churning of money and events .
And these things , as they move about the planet and everyone adds or subtracts numbers , numbers that are n't attached to anything at all , not even scraps of paper , we get the present system which is far from stable --- it is about to fly apart !
From the Street.com :
The salutary impact of an increasingly levered hedge fund industry , globalization , financial innovation , recycling of financial flows , lower taxes , free trade and loose monetary policy -- which Pimco 's Bill Gross recently described as leading to a " stable disequilibrium " and others have termed leading to Goldilocks -- appears to be waning .
At the same time that these factors are changing , it is particularly worrisome that risk spreads are at near historic lows , global equity markets seem priced nearly for perfection , the world 's investor base has never been more leveraged with margin debt and carry trades , and the U.S. consumer has never had so much debt , nor has he been so dependent on cheap money and the appreciation of stocks and homes .
Today , a synchronized worldwide economic expansion is morphing into a simultaneous tightening by the world 's major central banks .
The world 's debt markets are making lows in price and highs in yields ( e.g. , the yield on the 10 - year U.S. note increased by 20 basis points last week and by 50 basis points over the last four to five weeks ) .
And here it is : even with the world 's leading states either printing money or in the case of Japan , giving it away virtually free or in the case of China , hoarding it , we get a very dangerous situation where all the birds and there are several trillion birds flying madly about , if they all come home to roost they will pour into the USA 's Federal Reserves .
And this is what we call ' a panic ' which is when everyone presents their certificates and demands blood .

One of the more embarrassing mysteries of human evolution is that people are host to no fewer than three kinds of louse while most species have just one .
Even bleaker for the human reputation , the pubic louse , which gets its dates and residence - swapping opportunities when its hosts are locked in intimate embrace , does not seem to be a true native of the human body .
Its closest relative is the gorilla louse .
( Do n’t even think about it . )
Louse specialists now seem at last to have solved the question of how people came by their superabundance of fellow travelers .
And in doing so they have shed light on the two major turning points in the history of fashion : when people lost their body hair , and when they first made clothing .
Three kinds of louse call Homo sapiens their home , but each occupies a different niche on the human body .
The head louse , Pediculus humanus , lives in the forest of fine hairs on the scalp .
Its cousin , the body louse , lives not on the skin but in clothes .
And the exclusive territory of the pubic louse , Phthirus pubis , is the coarser hairs of the crotch .
Fidel Castro is recovering from intestinal surgery last summer
Last week the CIA published documents called the " Family Jewels " , revealing spy plots and assassination attempts .
The documents included plans to use Mafia help to kill Fidel Castro .
Mr Castro , still recovering after surgery last year , said in the official media the US was trying to pretend the tactics belonged to another era .
" Everything described in the documents is still being done , only in a more brutal manner around the entire planet , including an increasing number of illegal actions in the very United States , " President Castro wrote .
In an editorial called the Killing Machine , he wrote : " Sunday is a good day to read what appears to be science fiction . "
Lee Harvey Oswald
One of the key revelations of the documents was that the CIA tried to persuade mobster Johnny Roselli in 1960 to plot the assassination of the Cuban leader .

The plan was for poisoned pills to be put in Mr Castro 's food , but it was shelved after the US - sponsored invasion of the Bay of Pigs failed a year later .
Mr Castro has long accused the US , including President George W Bush , of plotting to kill him .
In his editorial , Mr Castro also refers to the assassination of John F Kennedy , saying the US president was the victim of the CIA and anti-Castro Cuban exiles .
Mr Castro says Lee Harvey Oswald could not have acted alone in killing the president .
" You lose the target after every shot even if it is not moving and have to find it again in fractions of a second , " Mr Castro , himself an expert marksman , says .
Mr Castro underwent intestinal surgery in July last year but in recent weeks his writings have been appearing more frequently .
The abuses and illicit activities listed in the CIA report date from the 1950s to the 1970s .
On Friday Cuba 's parliament passed a resolution stating that : " What the CIA recognises is not old history .
It is present - day reality and the facts show it . "
Advertisers have no control over where on Facebook their ads appear
First Direct , Vodafone , Virgin Media , the AA , Halifax and the Prudential have all withdrawn ads .
Virgin said it had to " protect its brand " .
The advertisements appeared on a rotating basis on the BNP - related page .
A BNP spokesman said there was no reason to avoid the party .
Facebook has declined to comment on the decision .
Mobile phone giant Vodafone and bank First Direct were alerted to the positioning of the ads by New Media Age magazine , while Virgin Media , the AA , Halifax and the Prudential withdrew later .
The spokesman for the BNP said : " There 's nothing wrong with the BNP . "
He added : " Unfortunately the media have created a bogeyman and really the fault lies with the media , who for some reason have vilified the BNP , and it has scared these people off . "
' Highly controversial '
However , the firms expressed concern over the ads ' positioning .
New Media
Age editor Justin Pearse said : " On the internet you often have little control of where your ads are shown , something that 's been highlighted by the unwitting association of some of the UK 's favourite brands with a highly controversial political cause . "
Our public policy principles state that we do not make political donations or support particular party political interests
Vodafone spokeswoman
First Direct spokesman Rob Skinner said : " We are obviously concerned about where our advertising appears .
" We have got to make sure that the places we advertise are consistent with our own values and identity . "
Vodafone said it wanted to continue to work with Facebook while " staying true " to its policies .
A spokeswoman for the mobile phone giant said it bought bundles of advertising space across a number of websites .
' Brand protection '
" As a result we were not aware that a Vodafone advertisement would appear next to a British National Party group on Facebook , " she said
" Our public policy principles state that we do not make political donations or support particular party political interests and therefore to avoid misunderstandings we immediately withdrew our advertising as soon as this was brought to our attention . "
The Prudential also said its policy was not to advertise with any political party .
A Virgin Media spokeswoman said : " We want to advertise on social networks but we have to protect our brand " .
She said the company was now talking to its advertising agency to find ways of giving it some control over where its adverts would be placed online .
The AA also said it booked advertising space through a specialist agency and had " strict procedures in place with its agency to ensure it does not advertise on inappropriate sites . "
It said it had recently pulled ads from YouTube after the BBC Panorama programme showed that videos of children fighting were being regularly uploaded .
In a statement , the Halifax said the position of ads on the site " is such that it may appear that we support the owners of specific pages .
This is not the case . "
As you may know , Dane County became the second county in the nation to call for impeachment on a 20 - to - 3 vote with 10 county board supervisors walking out of the meeting .
Above you should be able to see the YouTube video Luciano made of the August 16th mock funeral march , press conference and rally conducted in front of the Dane city / co. bldg . prior to the County Board meeting .

Am I my brother ’s reviewer ?
A word of explanation is needed here .
Some of you may know that I have a brother , Christopher , who disagrees with me about almost everything .
Some of those who read his books and articles also know that I exist , though they often dislike me if so .
But in general we inhabit separate worlds – in more ways than one .
He is of the Left , lives in the United States and recently became an American citizen .
I am of the Right and , after some years in Russia and America , live in the heart of England .
Occasionally we clash in public .
Scroll down for more
We disagreed about the Iraq War – he was for it , I was against it .
Despite the occasional temptation , I have never reviewed any of his books until today .
But now , in God Is Not Great , he has written about religion itself , attacking it as a stupid delusion .
This case , I feel , needs an answer .
Most of the British elite will applaud , since they see religion as an embarrassing and ( worse ) unfashionable form of mania .
And I am no less qualified to defend God than Christopher is to attack him , neither of us being experts on the subject .
People sometimes ask how two brothers , born less than three years apart , should have come to such different conclusions .
To which I ’d answer that I ’m not sure they ’re as different as they look , and that it ’s not over yet .
Christopher has quite often written and spoken about our upbringing and background , whereas I have n’t , but I think I ’m now entitled to give a small account of what we have in common .
Because my father was in the Navy , we were brought up in a very old - fashioned Britain .
Looking back , it often seems to have been a sombre landscape of grey warships and the stench of fuel - oil – but also of cathedral towers , bells and choral evensong .
Our boarding - school education , mainly on the edge of Dartmoor , took place in conditions closer by far to the Thirties than to now .
Our ancestry , so far as I have been able to dig it up , is a volatile mixture .
On my father ’s side , fierce West Country nonconformists mixed with gentle , rather saintly Hampshire Anglicans .
One grandfather was a pioneer of the National Union of Teachers and a straggler from the First World War , saved from the trenches by being sent to India .
Well into the Sixties his house was a museum of the world before 1939 : no telephone , no TV , but a quietly singing kettle always on the hob and a mangle in the porch , and he refused to read fiction because he thought it immoral .
As for the other grandfather , I have yet to track him down , and we were always told he was " killed in the war " , which is true in the sense that he was run over by a bus in the blackout .
From what I can gather , nobody was sorry about this , least of all his wife , my mother ’s mother , who had long before thrown him out of the house for his misdeeds .
She was partly Jewish , granddaughter of an immigrant from Prussian Poland , who confused things greatly ( from the point of view of the racially obsessed ) when he married a nice English girl .
There ’s enough material in that background for quite a lot of fraternal variety , I think .
Christopher is an atheist .
I am a believer .
He once said in public : " The real difference between Peter and myself is the belief in the supernatural .
" I ’m a materialist and he attributes his presence here to a divine plan .
I ca n’t stand anyone who believes in God , who invokes the divinity or who is a person of faith . "
I do n’t feel the same way .
I like atheists and enjoy their company , because they agree with me that religion is important .
I liked and enjoyed this book , and recommend it to anybody who is interested in the subject .
Like everything Christopher writes , it is often elegant , frequently witty and never stupid or boring .
I also think it is wrong , mostly in the way that it blames faith for so many bad things and gives it no credit for any of the good it may have done .
I think it misunderstands religious people and their aims and desires .
And I think it asserts a number of things as true and obvious that are nothing of the sort .
At the heart of this book are two extraordinary , bold statements .
One is a declaration of absolute faith , faith that religion has got it wrong , a mental thunderbolt of unbelief .
Christopher describes how at the age of nine he concluded that his teacher ’s claim that the world must be designed was wrong .
" I simply knew , almost as if I had privileged access to a higher authority , that my teacher had managed to get everything wrong . "
At the time of this revelation , he knew nothing of the vast , unending argument between those who maintain that the shape of the world is evidence of design , and those who say the same world is evidence of random , undirected natural selection .
It ’s my view that he still does n’t know all that much about this interesting dispute .
Yet at the age of nine , he " simply knew " who had won one of the oldest debates in the history of mankind .
It is astonishing , in one so set against the idea of design or authority in the universe , how often he appeals to mysterious intuitions and " innate " knowledge of this kind , and uses religious language such as " awesome " – in awe of whom or what ?
Or " mysterious " .
What is the mystery , if all is explained by science , the telescope and the microscope ?
He even refers to " conscience " and makes frequent thunderous denunciations of various evil actions .
Where is his certain knowledge of what is right and wrong supposed to have come from ?
How can the idea of a conscience have any meaning in a world of random chance , where in the end we are all just collections of molecules swirling in a purposeless confusion ?
If you are getting inner promptings , why should you pay any attention to them ?
It is as absurd as the idea of a compass with no magnetic North .
You might as well take moral instruction from your bile duct .
Two pages later , speaking for atheists in general , he announces : " Our belief is not a belief . "
To which one can only reply : " Really ?
And that thing in the middle of your face .
I suppose that ’s not a nose , either ? "
Christopher is not tentative about his view on God .
He describes himself as an " anti- theist " , so certain of his , er , faith that he wars with bitter mockery against those who doubt his truth .
Well , I wish I were as certain about any of these things as Christopher is about his anti-creed .
He reminds me rather more of the bearded Muslim sages of the Deoband Islamic university in India I met last year , than of the cool , thoughtful Anglicanism that we were both more or less brought up in .
For the purposes of this book , religion is identified as a fanatical certainty .
No doubt there are plenty of zealots who suffer from this problem .
But it is obvious to anyone that vast numbers of believers in every faith are filled with doubt , and open to reason .
The Church of England ’s greatest martyr , Thomas Cranmer , was burned at the stake for changing his mind once too often .
The noblest thinker of that Church , Richard Hooker , enthroned reason , alongside tradition and scripture , as one of the governing principles of faith , and warned against crude literal use of the Bible to justify or prohibit any action .
Yet Christopher repeatedly asserts that believers " claim to know " , not just to know , but to know everything .
This simply is not true .
Nor do we take the Bible literally .
I never imagined that scripture had the fact - checked authenticity of , say , an account in The New York Times – though as we know even that grand newspaper sometimes publishes made - up stories without realising it .
Did the Supper at Emmaus really take place ?
How I hope that it did , but I do not know that it did , in the way that I know a British soldier has recently been flown home dead from Basra or Helmand , or even in the way that I know that another such soldier will soon make the same sad journey .
Many decades have passed since I fancied the story of Adam and Eve was literal truth , if I ever did .
Rather more recently I have realised the great warning against human arrogance that is contained in it , the serpent ’s silky promise that if we reject the supposedly foolish , trivial restrictions imposed on us by an interfering , jealous nuisance of a God , then we shall be liberated .
As the serpent promises : " Ye shall be as gods . "
These may be the most important words in the whole Bible .
Take the enticing satanic advice , and you arrive , quite quickly , at revolutionary terror , at the invention of the atom bomb , at the torture chamber and the building of concentration camps for those unteachable morons who do not share your vision of a just world .
And also you arrive at the idea , embraced by Christopher , that by invading Iraq , you can make the world a better place .
I hesitated about mentioning this .
Was it unfair , a jab below the belt ?
No .
Much of his book is devoted to claiming that religious impulse drives Man to do , or excuse , or support wicked and terrible things in the name of goodness .
Is this not a perfect description of the Iraq War , which he backed ?
On the few occasions where Christopher is prepared to admit that religious people have done any good , he concludes that they did so in spite of their faith , not because of it .
He even suggests that the atheist Soviet tyranny was itself a form of religion .
You ca n’t win against this sort of circular absolutism .
Yet he has this absurdly backwards .
Religious and unbelieving people have both done dreadful things , and the worst of them have committed their murders and their tortures in the belief that they were doing good .
Nothing is proved by either side in this argument , by pointing to the mountains of skulls piled up by evil atheists , and evil theists .
What they have in common is that they are human , and capable of the sin of pride .
The practice of religion does not automatically prevent this , and nobody said it did .
It sometimes joins in with it , as Christopher points out .
But if there is a voice raised against such arrogant pride in the heedless modern world , it is usually a religious one , and the death camps and dungeons of dictators always contain their ration of the faithful who – at the cost of all they held dear in the world – have listened to their consciences even when the message was so unwelcome .
Perhaps they are just mad : I do not think so .
My claims , you see , are much milder than his .
When I skulk in the pew of a nearly - empty church , repeating the lovely , poetic formulas of the Church of England , I do not imagine that I am saved for all eternity .
For all I know , Christopher is absolutely right – my prayers are pointless and a meaningless oblivion awaits .
But if he is right , what a dispiriting , lowering truth it is .
Atheists like to claim they behave no worse than believers , and often better .
I do n’t deny it , in my case .
It would be easy for almost anyone to have lived a more virtuous life than mine .
But why should atheists care , or use such terms as " good " and " virtue " anyway ?
If we are weak and poor , we can all summon up self - interested decency , behaving in a kind way , in public , towards those from whom we hope for decency in return .
But as soon as we have the power to do evil , we generally do .
What is to stop us , unobserved , doing and planning acts of selfish unkindness against others , as so many of us do – for example – in office politics ?
What is to stop us , in the privacy of the home , taking advantage of the goodness of others more generous than ourselves ?
Who will ever know ?
If we become rich or mighty , how much worse the problem is .
We can rob , wound and defraud our fellow creatures without any fear that they will be able to take revenge .
A surprising number of us have power to act in this way .
Look at the annual massacre of unborn babies , done away with for the convenience of adults .
In the harsher parts of our great cities , strong , violent people rule their neighbours with pre-medieval savagery , demonstrating a fine understanding of what it means if there is no God : that if something works for you , and you can get away with it , then you may do it without fear of consequence in this world – and there is no next world .
That is practical atheism .
Those who follow it probably cannot even spell it .
Comfortable , suburban unbelievers hate to have this pointed out to them .
They would never behave like that , surrounded as they are by the invisible web of ten centuries of Christian law and morality , which still protects the nicer parts of our country .
But it is the application of what they preach , the worship of self and power .
Faith and belief can be and often are restraints on this arrogance of power .
They offer the possibility of justice where human society fails to provide it – as it almost always does fail .
There is one chapter in this book whose implications are sinister .
It is Chapter 16 , which attempts to suggest that religion is child abuse .
On the basis of such arguments , matched by similar urgings from Professor Richard Dawkins , I can see a movement growing to outlaw the teaching of faith to children .
Then what ?
Liberal world reformers make the grave mistake of thinking that if you abolish a great force you do n’t like , it will be replaced by empty space .
We abolished the gallows , for example , and found we had created an armed police and an epidemic of prison suicides .
We abolished school selection by exams , and found we had replaced it with selection by money .
And so on .
We are in the process – encouraged by Christopher – of abolishing religion , and so of abolishing conscience , too .
It is one of his favourite jibes that a world ruled by faith is like North Korea , a place where all is known and all is ordered .
On the contrary , North Korea is the precise opposite of a land governed by conscience .
It is a country governed by men who do not believe in God or conscience , where nobody can be trusted to make his own choices , and where the State decides for the people what is right and what is wrong .
And it is the ultimate destination of atheist thought .
If you do not worship God , you end up worshipping power , whether it is Kim Jong Il , Leon Trotsky or the military might of George W. Bush .
In which case , God help you .
Which Hitchens do you agree with ?

Many people are teaching programmers object oriented programming by thinking about real world objects .
A chicken and a sparrow are both birds , so think about creating a bird class , and deriving 2 subclasses .
A sparrow definitely cannot cluck , so only the chicken gets a cluck method .
At this point , the teacher , who likely has never seen a chicken without breading and cole slaw , tries to figure out if chickens can fly .
Since I grew up with a friend who raised chickens , I will give both a fly method , but the chickens will print ' flutter ' .
This gives us :
abstract class Bird
{
abstract void Fly ( ) ;
bool has Feathers ( ) { return true ; }
}
public class Sparrow : Bird
{
override void Fly ( )
{
print ( ' Fly ' ) ;
}
}
public class Chicken : Bird
{
override void Fly ( )
{
print ( ' Flutter ' ) ;
}
void Cluck ( )
{
print ( ‘ Cluck ’ ) ;
}
}
void SomeMethod ( )
{
Chicken chicken = new Chicken ( ) ;
Sparrow sparrow = new Sparrow ( ) ;
print ( ' Do sparrows have feathers ' ) ;
print sparrow.hasFeathers ( ) ;
print ( ' Can sparrows fly ? ' ) ;
print ( ' Sparrows ' ) ;
print sparrows .
Fly ( ) ;
print ( ' Do chickens have feathers ' ) ;
print chicken.hasFeathers ( ) ;
print ( ' Can chickens fly ? ' ) ;
print ( ' Chickens ' ) ;
print chicken .
Fly ( ) ;
}
What could be easier ?
This teaches a student how to categorize based on logical real world concepts and how to implement inheritance in C++ style languages .
There is a huge problem with this though .
We do n't want new programmers to categorize based on logical real world concepts .
Often times , logical real world concepts is a good place for production programmers to start dividing up large problems .
But students at this level are n't ready to work on problems 1/10th that size .
Consider the code :
void SomeMethod2 ( )
{
print ( ' Do sparrows have feathers ?
True ' ) ;
print ( ' Can sparrows fly ?
Sparrows fly ' ) ;
print ( ' Do chickens have feathers ?
True ' ) ;
print ( ' Can chickens fly ?
Chickens flutter ' ) ;
}
Aside from being too trivial to use to teach programmers , SomeMethod2 ( ) is better in all possible ways ( extensible , readable , maintainable etc ) .
If we wanted to write a non-trivial program to track various attributes about birds , we likely would create a relational database .
This is an extremely dangerous , wrong lesson that programmers will need to unlearn later .
Some programmers simply do n't unlearn this , just cannot stop classifying , and probably would have been happier as taxonomists in the biology department .
Legal secretaries are users , so why not derive a class from them for users - heck why not even derive them from a secretary class ?
U.S. Dollars are money , Wednesday is a weekday .
When the only tool you have is a hammer , every problem looks like a nail .
There is no end to the number of real world relationships that the tool of object oriented programming seems to apply to .
Maybe someone can teach them Prolog .
The reason we have object oriented programs is not to classify but to create good coupling and cohesion in ways easy for human beings to understand .
Bad chicken code completely ignores coupling and cohesion , the above example ( and most bad chicken code ) only suffers from bad cohesion , but throw a bad chicken coder at a large enough problem , and you get coupling issues as well , since they are thinking in terms of classification , not relationships , abstraction or data flow .
Ian Griffiths ( http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2005/09/26/extensionmethods) comments on inheritance and says “ It conflates two very important but really rather different concepts : reuse and polymorphism ” .
Now we are teaching our students to use inheritance to define relationships and classifications rather than reuse or polymorphism .
I was writing programs complicated enough to justify object oriented code long before I learned object oriented programming , and I am not sure how I would go about teaching a new programmer now .
You cannot completely ignore classes if you teach using Java or similar languages , and teaching Pascal ( how I learned ) is just too outdated .
Maybe it would be best to gloss over the class keyword until programmers are writing 1,000 line programs ( 1 class , several methods ) , and then show them how much easier programming is if you break code up based on related functionality .
That way they understand why and when to use different classes at the same time they learn how .
Being able to add an independent , event driven program to any object in the world makes scripting in Second Life really intuitive : you add a script and your object becomes an independent agent able to sense its world through event handlers , sit and think and then effect the world through library calls .
It 's a model that works equally well whether you 're coding a fish which swims around looking for food or an information post that just hands out notecards whenever it 's poked .
It 's an approach that quickly leads to lots of running scripts .
Some of the more complex regions constantly run 1000s of scripts .
Abbotts Aerodrome runs around 2000 scripts and while most of these are of the give notecard when poked variety they could just as well be calculating PI or running SETI at Home , which means they all need to behave as if they were independent processes running concurrently within the simulator .
Supporting such high levels of concurrency has been one of the major challenges in integrating Mono in to Second Life .
Although Mono and the CLI support the concept of independent threads of execution , each Mono thread maps on to an operating system thread which tend to be fairly heavyweight .
By default most operating systems reserve megabytes of memory for each thread and do n't cope with more than a few dozen running concurrently .
Even reducing the allocated stack size to 32 K and using the latest thread libraries on Linux does n't get you much past 1000 running threads before the system starts to wheeze .
The other difficulty with Second Life scripts is that they can migrate between simulators while they are running .
You are perfectly entitled to write a script which never stops running and then to tie it to a rocket that you fire in to another region .
This is relatively easy to do when all of your script state is in a single 16 K block , but much harder when your script has been Just In Time compiled to machine code and its state is scattered throughout memory , registers and an operating system thread .
The solution we implemented for Second Life was to use RAIL on top of .
NETs Reflection and Reflection .
Emit facilities to inject microthreading in to the script assemblies , an approach used by the JavaGoX and Brakes projects to implement mobile agents in Java .
Our microthread injector searches through the script assembly finding points where the script should yield and inducing the types on the stack at those points .
It can then inject extra opcodes in to the assembly which copy the stack in to a heap object and cause the script to yield .
Whenever a script yields we can restore another script from its previously saved heap object and start it running again , allowing us to schedule many microthreaded scripts on a single operating system thread .
By marking the heap objects as serializable we can then just use the standard .NET communication facilities to migrate scripts to remote simulators where they can continue running .
The approach is memory efficient as the memory needed to save the microthread is allocated when it yields , so a large amount of stack space does n't need to be conservatively reserved up front for the thread .
The problems with this approach is that it is expensive in CPU time spent switching microthreads and the space taken up by injected opcodes .
An alternative approach to microthreading Mono has been taken by Tomi Valkeinen who has written some very funky code ( inspired by Eve Online 's use of Stackless Python ) to save and restore the native stack to switch between microthreads .
This approach should be a lot faster than opcode injection .
We can't currently use Tomi's microthreads for Second Life as the saved stack may contain pointers which can't be transferred to a remote machine , but it may be possible in the future to use Mono 's garbage collector to identify the pointers in the native stack and twizzle them in to a form that can be sent to a remote machine .
It would be very cool to build a library which automatically switched between Tomi 's microthreading implementation on Mono and Linden Lab microthreading on .
NET .
People could then build portable microthreaded applications which take advantage of Mono 's native microthreading when it 's available .

Like a molten thread of white heat , lightning cuts across the grey skies above midtown Manhattan to find the top of the Empire State Building .
The storm yesterday afternoon was part of the latest blast of bad weather to hit New York .
The murky skies and lightning , seen from across the East River in this dramatic picture , were accompaniedby 72 mph winds and a deluge which saw an inch of rain fall in nearby Central Park .
Scroll down for more ...
There was no damage to the 1,454ft Empire State Building .
The lightning rod at its very top absorbs such strikes around 100 times a year .
It may not , however , have been such a good day to visit the outdoor viewing gallery on the 86th floor .
Watching a phishing attack live Yesterday a phishing mail for a community bank in a US east coast state ( throughout this blog post I have obscured many details including names , domains and IP addresses ) slipped through GMail 's spam / phish filter and then right through POPFile .
Only Thunderbird bothered to warn me that it might be a scam .
The message itself was sent from an ADSL connected machine in China .
Of course , since I do n't have an account with this bank it was an obvious phish , but I was curious about it so I followed the link in the message .
The link appeared to go to https://*****bank.com/Common/SignOn/Start.asp but actually went to http://***.***.164.158:82/*****bank.com/Common/SignOn/Start.html.
Clearly a phish running on a compromised host .
A reverse DNS lookup on the IP address of the host revealed that the phish was being handled by a web server installed in a school in a small central Californian town .
The machine appeared to be running IIS , but the phishing server identified itself ( on port 82 ) as Apache / 2.0.55 ( Win32 ) Server .
The Start . html page was identical to the actual sign on page used by the bank .
In fact taking a screen shot of the real page and doing a screen shot of the phishing page revealed that they were identical .
Even the MD5 checksum of the images was the same .
Naturally , not everything was the same in the HTML .
Although almost all the HTML was identical ( with the phishing site even pulling its images off the real bank 's site ) , the name of the script that handled validation of the user name and password had been changed from SignOn.asp ( the actual bank uses ASP ) to verify . php ( the phisher used PHP ) .
The only significant diff between the phisher site and the real site is :
272c272
< < form action =" verify.php " method= " post " id =" form1 " name = " form1 " >
---
> < form action = " SignOn.asp " method= " post " id =" form1 " name = " form1 " >
Once a username and password was entered the phishee was taken to a page asking for name , email address , credit card number , CVV2 number and PIN ( with the PIN asked for a second time for validation ) .
After that the user was thanked for verifying their details .
The user name , password , credit card number , CVV2 number and PINs were saved to a file called red.txt in the same directory as the HTML and PHP files used to make the phishing site .
How do I know that ?
Simple , by popping up one level in the phishing URL to http://***.***.164.158:82/*****bank.com/Common/SignOn/
I was able to get a directory listing .
In the directory there were three HTML files , two PHP scripts and red.txt .
Clicking on that file gave me access to the phished details as they came in .
I quickly informed the bank and US CERT of the phishing site .
I tried to figure out how to contact the school , but it was 0500 in California .
Here 's a sample entry from the actual log file .

The time is local to California and you can see the details that the person entered .
Here clearly a vigilante has decided to mess with the phisher by entering bogus details .
In fact , the last time I was able to access the site ( before it was pulled down ) there were 33 entries in the log file .
Of these 32 contained nothing , or offensive user names and passwords .
But one seemed to contain legitimate information .
The log file had a first entry at 0454 California time from a machine owned by MessageLabs ( I assume that they are doing some automated testing of phishing sites ) , the last entry was as 1226 California time .
The one legitimate entry contained a valid Visa card number ( valid in the sense that the number validated against the standard Luhn check digit algorithm ) .
Also the user name and password looked legitimate and a quick Google search revealed that the username was also used as part of the email address of a small business in the same town as one of this small bank 's branches .
It looked very likely that this entry was legitimate and the person had given away their real card number and PIN .
US CERT quickly responded with an auto - response assigning me an incident number and I received an email from the bank 's IT Ops Manager Jack .
Jack told me that he was already aware of the site and that this was the third time this little bank had been phished from machines in California and Germany .
I gave Jack the name of the school in California , and he said he'd get in contact with them ( he 'd already called the FBI ) .
I also told Jack about the one card number that looked totally legitimate ; he told me he was in charge of all card operations at the bank and had the power to deal with it .
Some hours after that the site went offline .
Yesterday a phishing mail for a community bank in a US east coast state ( throughout this blog post I have obscured many details including names , domains and IP addresses ) slipped through GMail 's spam / phish filter and then right through POPFile .
Only Thunderbird bothered to warn me that it might be a scam .
The message itself was sent from an ADSL connected machine in China .
Of course , since I do n't have an account with this bank it was an obvious phish , but I was curious about it so I followed the link in the message .
The link appeared to go tobut actually went to .
Clearly a phish running on a compromised host .
A reverse DNS lookup on the IP address of the host revealed that the phish was being handled by a web server installed in a school in a small central Californian town .
The machine appeared to be running IIS , but the phishing server identified itself ( on port 82 ) as The Start . html page was identical to the actual sign on page used by the bank .
In fact taking a screen shot of the real page and doing a screen shot of the phishing page revealed that they were identical .
Even the MD5 checksum of the images was the same .
Naturally , not everything was the same in the HTML .
Although almost all the HTML was identical ( with the phishing site even pulling its images off the real bank 's site ) , the name of the script that handled validation of the user name and password had been changed from ( the actual bank uses ASP ) to ( the phisher used PHP ) .
The only significant diff between the phisher site and the real site is :
Once a username and password was entered the phishee was taken to a page asking for name , email address , credit card number , CVV2 number and PIN ( with the PIN asked for a second time for validation ) .
After that the user was thanked for verifying their details .
The user name , password , credit card number , CVV2 number and PINs were saved to a file calledin the same directory as the HTML and PHP files used to make the phishing site .
How do I know that ?
Simple , by popping up one level in the phishing URL toI was able to get a directory listing .
In the directory there were three HTML files , two PHP scripts and red.txt .
Clicking on that file gave me access to the phished details as they came in .
I quickly informed the bank and US CERT of the phishing site .
I tried to figure out how to contact the school , but it was 0500 in California .
Here 's a sample entry from the actual log file .
The time is local to California and you can see the details that the person entered .

Secret Document : U.S. Fears Terror ' Spectacular ' Planned
http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=3336148 ^ | July 1 , 2007 | BRIAN ROSS , RHONDA SCHWARTZ and RICHARD ESPOSITO
Posted on by BenLurkin
A secret U.S. law enforcement report , prepared for the Department of Homeland Security , warns that al Qaeda is planning a terror " spectacular " this summer , according to a senior official with access to the document .
U.S. officials have kept the information secret , and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said today on ABC News ' " This Week with George Stephanopoulos " that the United States did not have " have any specific credible evidence that there 's an attack focused on the United States at this point . "
As ABCNews.com reported , U.S. law enforcement officials received intelligence reports two weeks ago warning of terror attacks in Glasgow and Prague , the Czech Republic , against " airport infrastructure and aircraft . "
The warnings apparently never reached officials in Scotland , who said this weekend they had received " no advance intelligence " that Glasgow might be a target .
Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff declined to comment specifically on on the report today , but said " everything that we get is shared virtually instantaneously with our counterparts in Britain and vice versa . "
Unlike the United States , officials in Germany have publicly warned that the country could face a major attack this summer , also comparing the situation to the pre-9/11 summer of 2001 .

The media claims that the Bush Administration is overstating the threat from international terrorism and they screaming that “ we ” are n’t being open about the threat posed by specific terrorist groups .
The Nattering Naybobs of Negativity should ask John Freeloadin ’ Kerry how much terrorism it takes to rise about his acceptable “ nuisance level ” of terrorism .

IMO it ’s only a matter of time .
We allow tens of thousands of people to come and stay in our nation from states where the populace hates us .
In round about manners we actually allow people to enter from states that allow terrorist training camps on their soil .
When it happens our leaders will voice astonishment that any of these practices could lead to tens of thousands of dead U.S. citizens .
I ’ve got a good idea .
Why not close more bases , specifically air bases that would allow us to get aircraft in the air over D.C. or New York city .
Before 09/11 our brain - trusts seemed to think this was a super idea .

This seems to be standard operational procedure for the media ... immediately after a terrorist attack release a news bulletin stating that a warning had been received by authorities prior to the attack .
With the clear implication that official bungling was somehow to blame ...

Congressman Peter King ( the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security Committee ) said on WABC Radio ’s Religion on the Line program this morning that the “ chatter ” going on on the terrorist networks is at the same level as the summer of 2001 ; and that it looks like a “ difficult ” summer .

Former US Attorney alleges Justice cover - up in his firing RAW STORY
Published : Monday May 21 , 2007 Print This Email This
One of the nine U.S. attorneys whose firing has led to an investigation into the Justice Department alleged a government cover - up of the real reason he was ousted .
John McKay , who was a U.S. Attorney in Seattle during a disputed 2004 Governor 's race in Washington , said over the weekend that he may have been sacked because of insufficient pursuit of criminal charges against Democrats related to that ultra-close race .
" I can see why they would want to come up with an explanation other than the governor 's election for why I would be on such a list , " McKay said in a speech to a group of moderate Republicans in Wenatchee , Wash . , according to a McClatchy Newspapers report .
McKay , who was fired in December , said he first appeared on a list of prosecutors to be let go in 2005 , in the midst of disputes over the state 's governor 's race .
Democrat Chris Gregoire won that election by just 133 votes , and Republicans were calling for election fraud charges to be brought .
If McKay was fired for not bringing charges , he said , " I think it is an entirely improper and perhaps illegal reason for my termination . "
A federal investigation McKay led found no evidence of a crime in the election .
The Justice Department has given conflicting explanations for McKay 's dismissal , with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales telling congressional investigators it was because of McKay 's public comments about budget cuts and dissatisfaction with his pursuit of an information - sharing project .
Gonzales has faced withering criticism for his role in the firing of the nine U.S. Attorneys and allegations from Democrats and some Republicans that the prosecutors were fired because they were not sufficiently loyal to Republican priorities .
Several attorneys who were fired either were in the midst of investigations against Republicans or were not pursuing charges against Democrats .
At least five Republican Senators have called for Gonzales ' resignation , and many observers say it is only President Bush 's intense feelings of loyalty to his longtime aide that is keeping Gonzales in office .
The senate is expected to take up a " no confidence " vote on Gonzales , perhaps as early as this week , unless he resigns first .
[ That 's my dad at right , in a picture from 1979 or 1980 .
I 'm there on the left , my brother is on the right . ]
One of my earliest memories of my father and technology dates back to 1980 when he bought a VCR .
The VCR he'd purchased was a boxy , clunky affair with a wired remote , but we were all amazed that we could just watch a movie anytime we wanted , as many times as we wanted .
At least when we were able to find videos to play on it .
There was no such thing as a video store back then ( at least not in Merced , California , where I grew up ) , but I remember vividly the first two VHS tapes he bought : Alien and Blazing Saddles , neither of which I was allowed to watch at the time .
One day my dad brought home a copy of Empire Strikes Back way before it was officially released .
I do n't know where he got it from , but I do remember that we had so many people over to watch it that my dad split the signal from the VCR and set up a second feed on a TV in another room just for the kids .
It seemed like magic to me that you could even do something like that .
Early the next year I had my tonsils removed and had to miss about two weeks of school .
To help me pass the time my dad did what any responsible parent would do : he bought me an Atari 2600 , which instantly made me the most popular kid in the neighborhood .
My father never took much interest in gaming -- he thought it was a little frivolous , if harmless .
He was interested in computing , so not long after buying me the 2600 he bought an Atari 400 ( and then later an Atari 800 ) for the family and then started to teach himself BASIC .
My dad was never much of a programmer -- the only application I ever remember him creating was a very simple racing game -- but around this time he did take me along to a few meetings of the local computer enthusiasts group he belonged to .
From then on there was n't a time when we did n't have a computer in the house .
He realized pretty early on that computers were going to be the future and when I was about ten years old I remember him telling me one day that I needed to stop playing King 's Quest and get better at using MS - DOS .
If anything , though , my father was an A /V guy at heart .
He was an audiophile who used to tell me stories about how he'd been so obsessed with music that when he was a teenager he installed a portable turntable into the family car so they could listen to 45s on the road , a plan which backfired not because the needle would constantly skip ( which it did ) , but because one day he parked the car in the sun and accidentally melted all of his favorite records .
His quest for audio perfection led him to buy the first CD player sold in the US ( the Sony CDP - 101 , which I actually found in a stack of old A/V components here in his house ) and immediately started building a collection of CD's that numbers somewhere around 30,000 today .
He did his best to get me hooked as well , and for my 13th birthday he gave me a Sony D - 88 Pocket Discman , which was designed primarily for playing 3 - inch CD - singles .
[ Pictured at right : my dad in 1985 with the A/V rig he had set up in his bedroom .
Note the Pioneer LaserDisc player at the bottom with the Sony CDP - 101 just above it . ]
As he got older it became more difficult for my father to keep up with the latest technology -- he just never got totally comfortable with spending time online -- but he was a lifelong photographer who dived right into the digital revolution , picking up one of the first digital Canon digital SLRs and converting our family room into a digital photography workshop , complete with a large - format Epson printer that he used for giant prints he sold to corporate clients .
He loved being able to edit and correct his photos using a computer rather than a darkroom , and he spent hours scanning and organizing the tens of thousands of slides and negatives he had from before he made the switch to digital .
My father instilled me in his love for technology , but the most important things I learned from him have nothing to do with gadgets .
Even though he loved gadgets and electronics , he never made them his life ; they were just tools to make life easier or more enjoyable and were never a substitute for the friends , family , and patients that he always put first .
( He was a fierce advocate for his patients ; in all his years as an obstetrician he delivered almost 8,000 infants and never lost a single mother . )
What always amazed me about him was how multifaceted he was .
He was an intellectually curious physician living in a small town who had traveled the world , read at least a book a week up until he died , could continually kick my ass in Scrabble even though he did n't learn English until he was 23 , and knew practically everything there was to know about classical music , Spanish wines , and French cinema .
All I wanted to be when I grew up was as smart as my dad .
I knew that on some level I disappointed him when I decided not to follow in his footsteps and become a doctor .
He never really put much pressure on me to go to medical school or anything , but he did express his hope that I 'd love medicine as much as he did .
It took me a few years , but when I did finally figure out that I wanted to write about technology for a living he was tremendously supportive , and I remember how he'd always ask for extra copies of Red Herring so that he could send them to his brothers in South America .
And when he told me that one of his patients had asked him if he was related to me , I knew he was proud of what I was doing -- and to show it he even started asking me for advice about what gadgets to buy .
It 's difficult for me to write this .
I 've never shared much of my personal life on the site , mainly because I know that all of you read Engadget for the gadgets , not to hear me ( or anyone else ) whine about the details of what they did that day .
But I also know that there would n't be an Engadget without my father -- and not just because he inspired my passion for technology , or that it 's always been his dry , irreverent sense of humor that I 've tried to emulate in my writing .
He was the person who I turned to when I was wrestling with the decision to quit Gizmodo and start all over again with a new site , and he gave me the push in the right direction I needed .
My father grew up in an impoverished developing country where the only ticket out of poverty was to get an advanced degree and get a " safe " job as a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer , so it was a big deal for me when he said that I needed to take a risk and toss everything aside to start Engadget .
When I was home for Christmas in 2003 we stayed up late almost every night talking , and he gave me the confidence I needed to take the plunge and create the site when I was terrified about taking a chance on something that might fail .
Even though he had worked all his life for the kind of financial security he never had growing up , he also believed that you should never spend a second of your life doing something you did n't care about , and he knew how much I loved blogging .
He saw potential in me that I did n't see in myself .
That 's why one of the happiest moments in my life was when he was able to come to an Engadget reader meetup in San Francisco .
It meant a lot to me for him to see how successful Engadget had become , and it was so gratifying seeing him geek out with our readers , showing off his Canon EOS 5D to a fellow photographer and talking about and playing with all the gadgets on display like everyone else .
So maybe it's not all that surprising that this past Sunday the very last conversation I had with my father -- just three days before his untimely death -- was about gadgets .
He wanted to tell me about the new HDMI - enabled A/V receiver he'd just installed and about how this new universal remote he'd bought was n't working properly .
He even wanted some insider info on whether he should buy a replacement or whether there was a new version that was n't announced yet that he should wait for .
I advised him to wait , and promised that when I was back home in California next month I 'd help him get everything set up .
I expected I 'd spend this Father 's Day on the phone with him , maybe talking about the new two megapixel cameraphone he was using for casual photos ( he 'd just bought a 1GB microSD card for storing more pictures on the go ) and my upcoming wedding that is now just six weeks away .
Instead I 'm spending it in his home , surrounded by his family and friends , wishing that I had one last chance to help him troubleshoot his Sonos , or watch Da Ali G Show with him , or sit at his computer while he showed me photos from his last trip , or talk about what it was like growing up in Peru ( he had so many amazing stories which I 'd love to hear him tell again ) .
I 'll never have a chance to do any of that again , but I 'm beyond grateful for the 32 years I was able to spend with him .
My father was an intensely private person who'd probably be embarrassed that I 'm even talking about him here , but he was a good , honest , highly principled man who did everything he could to give his family a life that was better than the one he'd had growing up in Peru -- and the world deserves to know it .
I 'll spend the rest of my life trying to live up to the example he set for me .
Thanks for letting me share this with you .
Friday night on PBS Bill Moyers tells his personal take on Karl Rove , his career and his long , destructive political journey with the worst President in American history .
If you enjoy Bill Moyers work , or are just a fan of the truth , you 'll want to take a look at this clip .
If you 'd like to watch the entire segment you can watch it here .

Moyers : " Karl Rove figured out a long time ago that the way to take an intellectually incurious draft - averse naughty playboy in a flight jacket with chewing tobacco inhis back pocket and make him governor of Texas , was to sell him as God 's anointed in a state where preachers andtelevangelists outnumber even oil derricks and jack rabbits .
Using church pews as precincts
Rove turned religion into a weapon of political combat -- a batteringram , aimed at the devil 's minions , especially at gay people .
It 's so easy , as Karl knew , to scapegoat people you outnumber , and if God is love , as rumor has it , Rove knew that , in politics , you better bet on fear and loathing .
Never mind that in stroking the basest bigotry of true believers you coarsen both politics and religion . "

Out of all of Bill Joy 's contributions to technology , users appear most fond of one of the simplest - the vi editor .
Joy leaves a lasting legacy of work both in the general technology domain and at Sun Microsystems .
The Sun co-founder announced this week that he is leaving the company .
Among Joy 's list of achievements are BSD Unix , NFS , UltraSPARC designs and some work on Java .
But it 's vi , created in 1976 , that really captured Reg readers ' hearts .
" Bill 's greatest gift to mankind was left off his list of achievements ( in your article ) ... the vi editor , " writes reader Matthew Hawkins in Australia .
" I can live without NFS , Java and related technologies .
I 'm not sure if I can live without vi . "
Matthew is not alone in his feelings .
Other readers called vi , " Joy 's lasting contribution to humanity " and agreed they could not have worked without it .
To do vi justice , we turn to Linux Magazine , which has one of the best accounts of how Joy came up with this little gem .
Back in 1999 , the mag asked Joy what inspired him to write vi :
What happened is that Ken Thompson came to Berkeley and brought this broken Pascal system , and we got this summer job to fix it .
While we were fixing it , we got frustrated with the editor we were using which was named ed.
ed is certainly frustrating .
We got this code from a guy named George Coulouris at University College in London * called em - Editor for Mortals - since only immortals could use ed to do anything .
By the way , before that summer , we could only type in uppercase .
That summer we got lowercase ROMs for our terminals .
It was really exciting to finally use lowercase .
So we modified em and created en .
I do n't know if there was an eo or an ep but finally there was ex. [ laughter ]
I remember en but I do n't know how it got to ex .
So I had a terminal at home and a 300 baud modem so the cursor could move around and I just stayed up all night for a few months and wrote vi .
Linux Mag then asked : " So you did n't really write vi in one weekend like everybody says ? "
No .
It took a long time .
It was really hard to do because you 've got to remember that I was trying to make it usable over a 300 baud modem .
That 's also the reason you have all these funny commands .
It just barely worked to use a screen editor over a modem .
It was just barely fast enough .
A 1200 baud modem was an upgrade .
1200 baud now is pretty slow .
9600 baud is faster than you can read .
1200 baud is way slower .
So the editor was optimized so that you could edit and feel productive when it was painting slower than you could think .
Now that computers are so much faster than you can think , nobody understands this anymore .
The people doing Emacs were sitting in labs at MIT with what were essentially fibre - channel links to the host , in contemporary terms .
They were working on a PDP - 10 , which was a huge machine by comparison , with infinitely fast screens .
So they could have funny commands with the screen shimmering and all that , and meanwhile , I 'm sitting at home in sort of World War II surplus housing at Berkeley with a modem and a terminal that can just barely get the cursor off the bottom line .
It was a world that is now extinct .
People do n't know that vi was written for a world that does n't exist anymore - unless you decide to get a satellite phone and use it to connect to the Net at 2400 baud , in which case you 'll realize that the Net is not usable at 2400 baud .
It used to be perfectly usable at 1200 baud .
But these days you can't use the Web at 2400 baud because the ads are 24KB .
That 's just a bit of background on the creation of vi .
Enterprising types can take a peek here and here for more information on Joy 's vi work and the history of BSD Unix .
For the record , Reg readers did put Joy 's work writing the TCP / IP stack for BSD right up there with vi . ®
* Shortly after our story posted , Keith Clarke - a friend of George Coulouris - contacted The Reg with some updated information .
Coulouris was actually at Queen Mary College , University of London and not University College in London , as Joy recalled .
Coulouris then contacted us with some other fresh insights .
Many thanks , Keith and George .
Of course Keith is correct in saying that I was a Lecturer at Queen Mary College , University of London when I wrote the ' em ' editor .
There 's a bit more about what it was and how I came to pass it to Bill Joy on the web page that Keith has already cited .
There is some stuff about the design of ' em ' appended at the end of the page .
Paradoxically , I think we had more experience in screen - based interaction at the time than Bell Labs or Berkeley and it was for that reason that I saw the need for a screen editor .
It was less powerful than 'vi ' in that it allowed the cursor to move only within a single line .
This constraint arose mainly from the desire to make it work on the variety of vdu's ( and even the TTYs ) that we had available at the time .
But a full - screen editor is a lot more work to write and Bill deserves most of the credit he has received .
Having said that , 'vi ' would probably never have seen the light of day if I had n't sat down at the terminal next to him at Berkeley in the summer of 1976 and I would n't be surprised if some of my code lives on in ' vi ' .

Cambridge University has become an unlikely supporter of the government in the row about whether or not A - level exams have been dumbed down .
Academics at the university have praised ministers for introducing a new ' super - grade '
A* with more difficult questions to stretch the brightest pupils .
If the A * and other reforms are successful , they will consider withdrawing tough entrance tests that were introduced when confidence in the A - level slipped .
Dr Geoff Parks , director of admissions at Cambridge , said : ' We have stopped discussing introducing more admissions tests because of the reforms in A - levels . '
'[ The government ] is moving in the right direction and it is possible that , in a few years time , we will discontinue some of the tests already in place , ' he said .
' If the public examination system is doing the job , we will not need them . '
Currently , many candidates sit Thinking Skills Assessment tests in which they face 50 multiple - choice questions designed to measure potential .
But Parks and his colleagues have been impressed by the changes proposed for A - levels .
He welcomed the planned introduction of ' more open - ended questions ' , and the decision to bring work currently covered in the high level Advanced Extension Awards into A - level .
He is also pleased that one of the university 's recommendations was taken up - to base the A* grade only on final exams rather than the AS modules that can be retaken .
Exam boards , at the heart of the criticism around exam standards , welcomed the news yesterday .
Dr Mike Cresswell , director general of the exam board AQA , said he was ' delighted ' by Parks 's remarks .
Cresswell argued that A - levels were accessible to all students and it was preferable for universities to use a national system of exams rather than set their own tests .
Meanwhile , a study of how GCSEs have evolved over the past 20 years has found that these exams give girls a bigger advantage over boys than O - levels had .
An analysis by Alan Smithers , director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research , at the University of Buckingham , found that the ' gender gap ' grew much more quickly when the new exam system was introduced two decades ago .
' GCSE rewards consistency and persistence because questions tend to be structured and course work plays an important part , ' said Smithers .
' Those play to the strengths of girls .
Boys tend to do better at exams . '
Although the gap exists across the developed world , Smithers argued that some countries had education systems that gave girls a bigger advantage .
' Iceland has the archetypal girl - friendly system , ' he said .
The report also showed GCSE A grades ( including A* from 1994 ) have risen from 8.6 to 19.5 per cent , while A* to C has increased from 42.5 to 63.3 per cent .
The initiative could mean new ways to deal with mail messages
By opening up the code Yahoo hopes to help create a series of innovative ways to deal with e-mail messages .
Eventually it said there could be " tens of thousands " of add - ons and extras for the e-mail reader .
Yahoo is only the latest of the big web companies to open up their main services to the wider code developing community .
Mail man
Although Yahoo plans to keep control of the code that deals with user names and passwords , programmers will be able to tinker with almost every other part of the e-mail reading program .
Yahoo Mail has more than 257 million registered accounts .
The initiative could result in new looks for the Yahoo e-mail reader , innovative ways to display messages to get a quick idea of message contents or a series of add - ons that do more with the information found in mail messages .
" Yahoo is a very large company but we can't build every application that a user might want , " Chad Dickerson , head of Yahoo 's software developer relations , told the Reuters news agency .
In making this move , Yahoo is following the lead of many web firms including Google , Amazon , Flickr and business software maker Salesforce.com .
Before now only Yahoo's broadband partners , such as BT , have had access to the innards of the e-mail program .

Simulation proves it 's possible to eavesdrop on super - secure encrypted messages .
Hackers might be able to pick up on quantum encrypted messages .
Punchstock
A team of researchers has , for the first time , hacked into a network protected by quantum encryption .
Quantum cryptography uses the laws of quantum mechanics to encode data securely .
Most researchers consider such quantum networks to be nearly 100 % uncrackable .
But a group from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in Cambridge was able to ' listen in ' using a sort of quantum - mechanical wiretap .
The trick allowed them to tease out about half of the data , in a way that could n't be detected by those transmitting or receiving the message .
The group admits that their hack is n't yet capable of eavesdropping on a real network .
" It is not something that currently could attack a commercial system , " says Jeffrey Shapiro , a physicist at MIT and one of the authors on the study .
But they expect that one day it will be able to do so , if quantum encryption is n't adequately adapted to stop such hackers from succeeding .
Tangled message
“ It is not something that currently could attack a commercial system . ” Jeffrey Shapiro
MIT
Most quantum networks send secret data in the polarization of photons .
The sender encodes each photon 's polarization such that the receiver who tries to measure it will only get the right information out about half of the time .
When this information does come through , the duo can agree to use that particular bit of data as a key to encode and decode a message .
The system ensures secrecy because anyone intercepting a transmitted photon will disrupt its polarization , and affect the rate at which the receiver can correctly measure it .
So the sender and receiver can detect the eavesdropper by noticing a spike in the transmission error rate .
They can then stop communicating or try again on a different network .
Shapiro and his co-authors have successfully executed a trick that gets at least part - way around this .
To listen in , the team used a quantum - mechanical principle known as entanglement , which can link together two different traits of a particle .
Using an optical setup , the team was able to entangle the transmitted photon 's polarization with its momentum .
The eavesdropper could then measure the momentum in order to get information about the polarization , without affecting the original polarization .
But the tap is n't perfect , says co-author Franco Wong .
The entanglement does sometimes perturb the polarization , and Wong says that the team can only extract about 40 % of the transmitted data without causing the error rate to rise noticeably .
The idea for this cunning trick has been around since 1998 , but nobody had put it into practice until now .
The team 's experimental proof - of - concept is published in the 25 April issue of the journal Physical Review A1 .
Simulated attack
ADVERTISEMENT
Aside from the occasional perturbation to the polarization , there is a more important reason why the team 's particular setup would n't work in the real world , says Hoi-Kwong Lo , a quantum cryptographer at the University of Toronto in Canada .
Their apparatus destroys the photon by measuring its momentum .
So in this setup , the detector has to measure both polarization and momentum simultaneously , giving one bit of information to the eavesdropper and the other bit to the receiver .
This means both people have to be sitting in the same room , using the same photon detector , notes Lo .
That might just give the eavesdropper away .
To grab the information en-route would require a ' quantum non-demolition box ' — a theoretically possible but as - yet - unbuilt device that could measure the photon and pass it along .
" What they have done is a simulation of an attack , not a real one , " says Lo .
Shapiro and Wong agree .
And they add that a quantum cryptographic network can be simply tweaked to beat their attack .
By making the key out of a lot of photons instead of just a few , the sender and receiver could ensure that the eavesdropper never got enough of the key to use it .
Still , they say , the work shows that secrets — even quantum ones — are never entirely safe .

History of Neuro linguistic programming
Neuro Linguistic Programming ( NLP ) is a system co-founded by John Grinder and Richard Bandler for bringing about personal development in any individual by interpreting and translating the human perception , experience , beliefs and language .
It was developed in early 1970s with the active involvement of Gregory Bateson .
Gregory Bateson was a distinguished anthropologist , linguist , social scientist and a cyberneticist at the University of California at Santa Cruz between the periods of 1960s to1970s
What is Neuro Linguistic Programming ( NLP )
The basic principle of Neuro Linguistic Programming is that success can be achieved by increasing the positive habits and reducing the negative ones .
These positive habits either can belong to the same individual , or can be a model of habits of highly successful people .
The initial study of interpreting success patterns and behaviors was done on exceptional psychotherapists who were had attained the zenith of success in their field .
Neuro linguistic course started with the modeling the key behaviors and methods taken by the psychotherapists in order to achieve outstanding outcomes in their field .
This model would then be applied to individual wanting to achieve a similar level of success and excellence .
The Theory behind Neuro Linguistic Programming
The initial concept of Neuro Linguistic Programming could have said to be derived from the General Semantics theory by Alfred Korzybski , which was based on concept of creating a brand new outlook in life by training the mind .
This approach led to the creation of multiple schools of thought , with financially successful organizations set up to realize highest human potential with techniques such as Scientology , Dianetics and EST .
Several Esalen seminars were conducted that caught the attention of a range of people , such as the famous Virginia Satir , Milton H. Erickson , Gregory Bateson and Fritz Perls .
A ground - breaking aspect of the neuro linguistic philosophy was the method of practicing a technique rather than investing time in its theory .
The general process followed by most neuro linguistic practitioners was the generating a brand new concept , testing its merits by actual application on individuals , and concluding with detailed scientific reports on the outcome of the idea .
As a rule , no set process or guidelines were followed .
There was no bound on the exploration process , avoiding use of any standard procedure for Neuro Linguistic Programming Development .
The Neuro Linguistic Programming was influenced by the modern outlook of considering any problem as subjective to an individual ’s perception and experiences .
Anthropologist Bateson supported the concept of cultural relativism .
These techniques prodded Bandler and Grinder to make observations on their subjects by understanding their specific behaviors , rather than adopting the psychoanalytic approach of manipulating the interpretation as per the theory .
The ensuing linguistic model was used to influence a change in individual behavior by interpreting therapeutic recognition and analyzing the language patterns .
The model was initially published as “ The Structure of Magic Volume I ” in 1975 .
The book “ The Structure of Magic Volume II ” published in 1976 expanded on the model .
In 1976 , with the help of Satir , the book “ Changing with Families ” was published later on known as the Meta model and developing into a new field by itself .
The initial development on the Meta model generated keen interest of the anthropologist Gregory Bateson , who later on influenced foundation of domains such as double bind theory , logical levels and types , cultural relativism and cybernetic epistemology .
The initial studies on models such as Meta model and Milton model grasped the interest of several renowned psychotherapists and anthropologists , and also gained popularity with common people through their series of seminars and workshops .
With the increasing popularity and demand of NLP , a development group was formed with the NLP cofounders Grinder and Bandler , and noted NLP contributors such as Stephen Gilligan , Leslie Cameron - Bandler , Robert Dilts , David Gordon and Judith DeLozier .
The NLP seminars of Bandler and Grinder were later on published into a successful book “ Frogs into Princes ” by Steve Andreas in 1979 .
In an article titled “ Still Think That The Housing Bubble Is The Fault Of The Buyers And Not The Lenders ? ” , I proposed that while borrowers were not completely innocent , the lenders were still using quite devious practices to lure the borrowers into the fire .
If you ’ve been following the news at all , you ’ve no doubt heard of Countrywide ’s layoffs and what else has been going on with them .
But The New York Times just ran an expose of sorts on the inside of this lending giant .
Taken below were some of the more interesting parts .
Because of the size , I highlighted some of the more eye - popping moments in blue for you :
Providing “ the best loan possible ” to customers was n’t always the bank ’s main goal
On its way to becoming the nation ’s largest mortgage lender , the Countrywide Financial Corporation encouraged its sales force to court customers over the telephone with a seductive pitch that seldom varied .
“ I want to be sure you are getting the best loan possible , ” the sales representatives would say .
But providing “ the best loan possible ” to customers was n’t always the bank ’s main goal , say some former employees .
Instead , potential borrowers were often led to high - cost and sometimes unfavorable loans that resulted in richer commissions for Countrywide ’s smooth - talking sales force , outsize fees to company affiliates providing services on the loans , and a roaring stock price that made Countrywide executives among the highest paid in America .
…
Countrywide ’s entire operation , from its computer system to its incentive pay structure and financing arrangements , is intended to wring maximum profits out of the mortgage lending boom no matter what it costs borrowers , according to interviews with former employees and brokers who worked in different units of the company and internal documents they provided .
One document , for instance , shows that until last September the computer system in the company ’s subprime unit excluded borrowers ’ cash reserves , which had the effect of steering them away from lower - cost loans to those that were more expensive to homeowners and more profitable to Countrywide .
…
Homeowners , meanwhile , drawn in by Countrywide sales scripts assuring “ the best loan possible , ” are behind on their mortgages in record numbers .
As of June 30 , almost one in four subprime loans that Countrywide services was delinquent , up from 15 percent in the same period last year , according to company filings .
Almost 10 percent were delinquent by 90 days or more , compared with last year ’s rate of 5.35 percent .
Many of these loans had interest rates that recently reset from low teaser levels to double digits ; others carry prohibitive prepayment penalties that have made refinancing impossibly expensive , even before this month ’s upheaval in the mortgage markets .
Few companies benefited more from the mortgage mania than Countrywide
“ In terms of being unresponsive to what was happening , to sticking it out the longest , and continuing to justify the garbage they were selling , Countrywide was the worst lender , ” said Ira Rheingold , executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates .
“ And anytime states tried to pass responsible lending laws , Countrywide was fighting it tooth and nail . ” …
Countrywide lends to both prime borrowers — those with sterling credit — and so - called subprime , or riskier , borrowers .
Among the $ 470 billion in loans that Countrywide made last year , 45 percent were conventional nonconforming loans , those that are too big to be sold to government - sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac .
Home equity lines of credit given to prime borrowers accounted for 10.2 percent of the total , while subprime loans were 8.7 percent .
Regulatory filings show that , as of last year , 45 percent of Countrywide ’s loans carried adjustable rates — the kind of loans that are set to reprice this fall and later , and which are causing so much anxiety among borrowers and investors alike .
Countrywide has a huge presence in California : 46 percent of the loans it holds on its books were made there , and 28 percent of the loans it services are there .
Countrywide packages most of its loans into securities pools that it sells to investors .
…
But Countrywide documents show that it , too , was a lax lender .
For example , it was n’t until March 16 that Countrywide eliminated so - called piggyback loans from its product list , loans that permitted borrowers to buy a house without putting down any of their own money .
And Countrywide waited until Feb. 23 to stop peddling another risky product , loans that were worth more than 95 percent of a home ’s appraised value and required no documentation of a borrower ’s income .
As recently as July 27 , Countrywide ’s product list showed that it would lend $ 500,000 to a borrower rated C - minus , the second - riskiest grade .
As long as the loan represented no more than 70 percent of the underlying property ’s value , Countrywide would lend to a borrower even if the person had a credit score as low as 500 .
( The top score is 850 . )
The company would lend even if the borrower had been 90 days late on a current mortgage payment twice in the last 12 months , if the borrower had filed for personal bankruptcy protection , or if the borrower had faced foreclosure or default notices on his or her property .
Such loans were made , former employees say , because they were so lucrative — to Countrywide .
The company harvested a steady stream of fees or payments on such loans and busily repackaged them as securities to sell to investors .
As long as housing prices kept rising , everyone — borrowers , lenders and investors — appeared to be winners .
Blowing The Whistle : Countrywide ’s commission structure rewarded sales representatives for making risky , high - cost loans
One former employee provided documents indicating Countrywide ’s minimum profit margins on subprime loans of different sizes .
These ranged from 5 percent on small loans of $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 to 3 percent on loans of $ 350,000 to $ 500,000 .
But on subprime loans that imposed heavy burdens on borrowers , like high prepayment penalties that persisted for three years , Countrywide ’s margins could reach 15 percent of the loan , the former employee said .
Regulatory filings show how much more profitable subprime loans are for Countrywide than higher - quality prime loans .
Last year , for example , the profit margins Countrywide generated on subprime loans that it sold to investors were 1.84 percent , versus 1.07 percent on prime loans .
A year earlier , when the subprime machine was really cranking , sales of these mortgages produced profits of 2 percent , versus 0.82 percent from prime mortgages .
And in 2004 , subprime loans produced gains of 3.64 percent , versus 0.93 percent for prime loans .
…
As a result , former employees said , the company ’s commission structure rewarded sales representatives for making risky , high - cost loans .
For example , according to another mortgage sales representative affiliated with Countrywide , adding a three - year prepayment penalty to a loan would generate an extra 1 percent of the loan ’s value in a commission .
While mortgage brokers ’ commissions would vary on loans that reset after a short period with a low teaser rate , the higher the rate at reset , the greater the commission earned , these people said .
Persuading someone to add a home equity line of credit to a loan carried extra commissions of 0.25 percent , according to a former sales representative .
“ The whole commission structure in both prime and subprime was designed to reward salespeople for pushing whatever programs Countrywide made the most money on in the secondary market , ” the former sales representative said .
When borrowers had difficulty making payments , Countrywide cashed in
Consider an example provided by a former mortgage broker .
Say that a borrower was persuaded to take on a $ 1 million adjustable - rate loan that required the person to pay only a tiny fraction of the real interest rate and no principal during the first year — a loan known in the trade as a pay option adjustable - rate mortgage .
If the loan carried a three - year prepayment penalty requiring the borrower to pay six months ’ worth of interest at the much higher reset rate of 3 percentage points over the prevailing market rate , Countrywide would pay the broker a $ 30,000 commission .
When borrowers tried to reduce their mortgage debt , Countrywide cashed in : prepayment penalties generated significant revenue for the company — $ 268 million last year , up from $ 212 million in 2005 .
When borrowers had difficulty making payments , Countrywide cashed in again : late charges produced even more in 2006 — some $ 285 million .
The company ’s incentive system also encouraged brokers and sales representatives to move borrowers into the subprime category , even if their financial position meant that they belonged higher up the loan spectrum .
Brokers who peddled subprime loans received commissions of 0.50 percent of the loan ’s value , versus 0.20 percent on loans one step up the quality ladder , known as Alternate - A , former brokers said .
For years , a software system in Countrywide ’s subprime unit that sales representatives used to calculate the loan type that a borrower qualified for did not allow the input of a borrower ’s cash reserves , a former employee said .
The monthly payment on the F.H.A. loan would have been $ 1,829 , while Countrywide ’s subprime loan generated a $ 2,387 monthly payment
According to the former sales representative , Countrywide ’s big subprime unit also avoided offering borrowers Federal Housing Administration loans , which are backed by the United States government and are less risky .
But these loans , well suited to low - income or first - time home buyers , do not generate the high fees that Countrywide encouraged its sales force to pursue .
A few weeks ago , the former sales representative priced a $ 275,000 loan with a 30 - year term and a fixed rate for a borrower putting down 10 percent , with fully documented income , and a credit score of 620 .
While a F.H.A. loan on the same terms would have carried a 7 percent rate and 0.125 percentage points , Countrywide ’s subprime loan for the same borrower carried a rate of 9.875 percent and three additional percentage points .
The monthly payment on the F.H.A. loan would have been $ 1,829 , while Countrywide ’s subprime loan generated a $ 2,387 monthly payment .
That amounts to a difference of $ 558 a month , or $ 6,696 a year — no small sum for a low - income homeowner .
“ F.H.A. loans are the best source of financing for low - income borrowers , ” the former sales representative said .
So Countrywide ’s subprime lending program “ is not living up to the promise of providing the best loan programs to its clients , ” he said .
Countrywide ’s Oasis of Rapport
Workdays at Countrywide ’s mortgage lending units centered on an intense telemarketing effort , former employees said .
It involved chasing down sales leads and hewing to carefully prepared scripts during telephone calls with prospects .
One marketing manual used in Countrywide ’s subprime unit during 2005 , for example , walks sales representatives through the steps of a successful call .
“ Step 3 , Borrower Information , is where the Account Executive gets on the Oasis of Rapport , ” the manual states .
“ The Oasis of Rapport is the time spent with the client building rapport and gathering information .
At this point in the sales cycle , rates , points , and fees are not discussed .
The immediate objective is for the Account Executive to get to know the client and look for points of common interest .
Use first names with clients as it facilitates a friendly , helpful tone . ”
If clients proved to be uninterested , the script provided ways for sales representatives to be more persuasive .
Account executives encountering prospective customers who said their mortgage had been paid off , for instance , were advised to ask about a home equity loan .
“ Do n’t you want the equity in your home to work for you ? ” the script said .
“ You can use your equity for your advantage and pay bills or get cash out .
How does that sound ? ” …
Other documents from the subprime unit also show that Countrywide was willing to underwrite loans that left little disposable income for borrowers ’ food , clothing and other living expenses .
A different manual states that loans could be written for borrowers even if , in a family of four , they had just $ 1,000 in disposable income after paying their mortgage bill .
A loan to a single borrower could be made even if the person had just $ 550 left each month to live on , the manual said .
Independent brokers who have worked with Countrywide also say the company does not provide records of their compensation to the Internal Revenue Service on a Form 1099 , as the law requires .
These brokers say that all other home lenders they have worked with submitted 1099s disclosing income earned from their associations .
One broker who worked with Countrywide for seven years said she never got a 1099 .
“ When I got ready to do my first year ’s taxes I had received 1099s from everybody but Countrywide , ” she said .
“ I called my rep and he said , ‘ We ’re too big .
There ’s too many .
We do n’t do it . ’ ”
Countrywide Gets Sued
Last April , Countrywide customers in Los Angeles filed suit against the company in California state court , contending that it overcharged borrowers by collecting unearned fees in relation to tax service fees and flood certification charges .
These markups were not disclosed to borrowers , the lawsuit said .
Appraisals are another profit center for Countrywide , brokers said , because it often requires more than one appraisal on properties , especially if borrowers initially choose not to use the company ’s own internal firm .
Appraisal fees at Countrywide totaled $ 137 million in 2006 , up from $ 110 million in the previous year .
Credit report fees were $ 74 million last year , down slightly from 2005 .
All of those fees may soon be part of what Countrywide comes to consider the good old days .
The mortgage market has cooled , and so have the company ’s fortunes .
Mr. Mozilo remains undaunted , however .
In an interview with CNBC on Thursday , he conceded that Countrywide ’s balance sheet had to be strengthened .
“ But at the end of the day we could be doing very substantial volumes for high - quality loans , ” he said , “ because there is nobody else in town . ”
A very scary thought indeed .
Sogod Bay in Southern Leyte is still one of the Philippines ’ best kept dive secrets .
There ’s a smorgasbord of pristine reefs , abundant fish life , lots of critters and the promise of whale sharks – and very few other people there .
It ’s not often you go revisit somewhere nearly a decade later and find it almost totally untouched .
But that ’s what I found on a return trip to Sogod Bay in Southern Leyte in April 2016 , which is still , I think , the most underrated diving destination in the Philippines .
In fact , it was so good I recently went back for a third time in April 2017 .
I first went to Sogod Bay ten years ago in 2007 .
Back then it had already received a fair bit of coverage in dive magazines as a new hot spot with pristine reefs , plentiful fish life and bonus whale sharks making an appearance for a few months a year .
Amazingly , and hearteningly , very little has changed between April 2007 and April 2017 .
I was worried that the beautiful reefs and plentiful critters I remembered would be the stuff of fond memories rather than current reality – yet , after this second visit , it was frankly better than I remembered .
Whereas many dive spots are either coral reef noodling or muck / critter diving , Sogod has a great mix of several kinds of sites with different topography , all within half hour ’s boat ride of the resort .
If you want gorgeously coloured , teeming with fish reef on sloping walls with literally thousands of anthias making it a wide angle heaven , then Napantao marine reserve is the place to go .
If you want to play Hunt the mimic octopus in grey sand , head to the supposedly barren grey sands of Ghost Town .
If you want a sandy reef dive with nudibranches , demon stingers and zebra crabs galore , explore the house reef just in front of the resort .
And you have to do the " world famous in Southern Leyte " Padre Burgos pier night dive , where amongst the town ’s detritus live seahorses , snake eels and stargazers .
Napantao and Limasawa
Sogod has at least 20 sites and several are very much worth repeat dives , meaning you could be happily occupied here for a couple of weeks .
Napantao is the standout as the clouds of anthias around the corals are just endlessly beautiful , and the pristine reef continues further along at Olly ’s Wall ( actually more of a slope with wall - y interludes ) .
We had the pleasure of meeting Olly in 2016 as he was over visiting Sogod from the UK when we were there – he was previously a dive guide at Sogod and is a very nice chap .
Our dive guide Adam in 2017 was also great ( although he made me feel old by being only 19 ) and has been taught well by the resort ’s senior instructor and partner , the semi-legendary Pedro Batestil , who has been there since the resort ’s inception .
Several kilometres away Limasawa island in the mouth of the gulf harbours another two sites that are also marine protected areas .
Adrian ’s Cove and Zach ’s Cove are both remarkably pretty dives welll worth the 30 minute boat ride to get out there
Sogod Bay House Reefs
One of the other joys of the resort is that there is the house reef and then several other excellent sites that are essentially just a bit further along making them super accessible – 5 minutes and you ’re ready to descend on the site .
There ’s Max Climax , Baluarte and Bunga Bend all in close proximity to the house reef which shares its characteristics of a sandy slope interspersed with clumps of coral .
Max Climax however has a gorgeous drop off at 15 metres where you suddenly feel like you ’re in mid air .
Santa Sofia lies south of the resort just by the town of Padre Burgos and it ’s a lovely afternoon dive along a gentle slope as its home to several turtles , a couple of which are impressive sizes .
We dived here a couple of times and the hazy afternoon light made me want to see it in early morning as the reef wakes up .
Juvenile Barracuda are regularly spotted here , adding to the feel that the site is a sanctuary and something of an underwater nursery .
Sogod Bay Whale Sharks
Sogod Bay is part of the massive Leyte Gulf , with aqua waters of the shallow reefs by the shore quickly turning a dark inky blue as the reef drops off into abyssal depths .
This great depth so near the shoreline means that some of the biggest , deep sea creatures are occasionally seen – whales have been spotted coming up for air and dolphins skipping around prow of a boat are a common sight .
Most common of all though is the otherwise rarely seen whale shark .
( Watch this amazing video footage of Sogod Whale sharks shot by ace dive guide Pedro Bastille back on my Sogod Bay trip back in 2007 . )
The world ’s biggest fish usually start showing up in Sogod Bay around November and stay until April .
However , in 2016 they stopped showing around February and in 2017 in January , so their presence ca n’t be guaranteed .
They only started appearing in the gulf in the early 2000s , probably attracted by the spawning of the healthy local coral reefs which had been rigourously protected by legislation from an enlightened regional governness which has largely stayed in place .
Diving with the whale sharks is not allowed , only snorkelling , and special spotter boats go out looking for them .
It ’s a sedate affair with only 1 or 2 boats in the water usually – unlike the whale shark circus at Oslob .
Frankly , the diving at Sogod is so good ( sorry , had to do it ) that the non-appearance of whale sharks is a mild annoyance rather than a major disappointment – those who do n’t have too high expectations will be well rewarded .
How To Get To Sogod Bay
There ’s several reasons why Sogod Bay has remained pretty much untouched over the last 10 years – and that ’s because getting there is still fairly hard work .
You can get a domestic flight from Manila to Cebu and then get a ferry from Cebu to Leyte , and then it ’s a couple of hours drive to Sogod Bay .
Or , more typically , get a domestic flight from Manila to Tacloban which is in the northern part of the island .
The dive resort can send a driver to meet you , and then it ’s a three and a half drive down to southern Leyte .
Check on Skyscanner to compare prices and timings of flights to Manila , Cebu and Tacloban .
Tacloban airport and its namesake city were badly damaged during the 2013 typhoon season but is now fully restored .
As the only airport on the island , the typhoon has injected fresh drive into plans to open Maasin airport in the south so the island Leyte has two airports .
Sogod Bay would be only a 45 minute drive from the airport , making it far more convenient to visit .
It would probably open the floodgates for development and tourism too – and the impact of that development on Sogod ’s reefs , the very thing that makes it special , could be terrible if not handled carefully .
But , locals think Maasin airport will take years to materialise – it ’s been under discussion for a couple of decades already .
Until then , Sogod Bay is very much worth the effort to visit .
The reefs are fantastic and there ’s almost no - one else about – despite there being several dive operations here that have been in business for over a decade , it still feels like discovering a magical place that ’s all your own .
Go now before everyone else does .
Where To Stay At Sogod Bay
All three trips I ’ve done to Sogod Bay I ’ve stayed at Sogod Bay Scuba Resort – you can read previous guest reviews and book online at Agoda .
There are several other resorts in the area – Peter ’s Dive Resort , Padre Burgos Castle , Southern Leyte Divers and Leyte Dive resort .
Sogod Bay Liveaboards
Liveaboards do not feature Sogod Bay regularly on their itineraries .
It ’s possible to do a liveaboard around the Visayas ( central Philippines region ) and then from Cebu make your own way to Sogod – it ’s a great addition to a liveaboard trip if you have a couple of weeks in the Philippines .
Two liveaboards which run regular trips in the Visayas are Philippines Siren and Atlantis Azores – follow the links to check dates , availability and pricing .

Although Congressional staff members involved with the measure say Mr. Bush may want to sign it for patriotic reasons , he may also be reluctant to appear to be ceding power over federal officials to the states .
Under the bill , Mayor Adrian M. Fenty of Washington , a Democrat , would have the same authority as governors , meaning that he could instruct the White House and other federal buildings in the capital to lower the flag .

At a federal veterans hospital in Iron Mountain , Mich. , the flag stayed at full staff .
A bill would let governors order flags to half - staff .

In states where flags are lowered , the extent of the governors ’ orders varies .
Each time a soldier from California is killed , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , orders American and state flags lowered at the Capitol .
In Wisconsin , Gov. James E. Doyle , a Democrat , lowers the flag at all state buildings in such cases .
Virginia lowers just state flags .
In Michigan , Ms. Granholm has ordered the lowering of all flags at all state buildings , and urged the same for rest of the state , each time a soldier from the state was killed , or 127 times since December 2003 , when she began the practice .
“ It is not a statement about the war , but it is a statement about service and about soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice , ” she said .
Signed into law in 1942 , the United States Flag Code offers nonmandatory flag etiquette guidelines .
Joyce Doody , executive director of the National Flag Foundation in Pittsburgh , said governors had the authority to order flags flown at half - staff , though her organization suggests lowering state , not American flags , for fallen soldiers .
I was watching a top political consultant on TV the other day .
His head sported two tufts of over - achieving dryer lint above each ear , loosely connected by a few desperate strands across his bald - pated tundra .
It looked like the top part of a bad Halloween mask .
His job is to advise future presidents of the United States while being unaware of what ’s happening atop his own head .
This leads me to the story of presidential hopeful John Edwards and his $ 400 haircut .
In the interest of equal time , let ’s throw in Mitt Romney ’s recently reported $ 300 haircut .
Apparently the reason these haircuts are “ news ” is that rich men might be out of touch with the common person ’s issues .
I have a different take .
First , you ca n’t complain about $ 400 haircuts and also complain that the rich do n’t pay enough taxes .
The people who cut hair and mow lawns have taken matters into their own hands .
Something tells me that when Mitt Romney buys a cup of coffee and a doughnut at the local diner , it costs him $ 900 .
Second , what ’s wrong with being out of touch with the common person ’s issues ?
If our president had all the problems the common people do , he ’d be so busy itching and crying that he ’d have no time to run the country .
All things being equal , I prefer a president who has read an article about leprosy but does n’t have it .
Third , anyone who ca n’t afford a $ 400 haircut does n’t get my vote .
While it ’s theoretically possible that the guy working the French fry station at Burger World would make the best president ever , it ’s not a chance I ’m willing to take .
That guy has a lot of explaining to do .
No , I want a president who is so rich he can pay $ 400 for a haircut and pay another $ 300 to the pedicurist to fluff him while he ’s there .
I want a president who knows how to make money and is n’t afraid to use it .
Fourth , any candidate that does n’t understand the importance of good hair is too dumb to lead the country .
Just because Fred Thompson can pay $ 8 to get his head Turtle Waxed , that does n’t make him presidential material .
The men and women of this country have just two questions of our potential leaders :
Men : “ Would I want to be him ? ”
Women : “ Would I do him ? ”
A good head of hair goes a long way toward answering both of those questions .

Millions of Muslims now live in Western countries
What drives tension and conflict between Islam and the West ?
Is there an inherent incompatibility between the two , making a " clash of civilisations " inevitable ?
There are certainly Muslims and non-Muslims who hold that view .
Poll results : Common ground or conflict ?
Osama Bin Laden and his global jihadists see the " crusader "
West as inherently aggressive , waging a remorseless campaign to subjugate and humiliate Muslims .
Samuel Huntington , the Harvard professor who fathered the " clash of civilisations " thesis more than a decade ago , argues that cultural clashes - in particular between Islam and the West - have taken the place of the old ideological divide between communist East and capitalist West .
Ayaan Hirsi Ali argues Islam is incompatible with democracy
High - profile figures - such as the former Dutch MP , the Somali - born Ayaan Hirsi Ali - claim Islam is incompatible with democracy , women 's rights and modernity .
Many Muslims , as well as specialists on Islam , reject the sweeping generalisations on which such opinions rest .
Last year , Ayaan Hirsi
Ali's views were directly challenged by a prestigious think - tank in The Hague .
In a report submitted to the Dutch government , the Scientific Council for Government Policy said it was wrong to say Islam was at odds with democracy and human rights .
Analysing trends in a dozen Muslim countries , the report highlighted the diversity of Muslim thought .
While there were radical , jihadi trends , there were also mainstream movements moving , albeit gradually , towards democratisation .
Testing opinion
So what do ordinary people , Muslim and non-Muslim , think ?
Osama Bin Laden sees the West as inherently anti-Muslim
A new BBC poll taken by Globescan suggests there is a significant middle ground which rejects the view that Islam and the West are doomed to clash .
The pollsters questioned some 28,000 people in 27 countries .
An overall majority believes there is no inherent incompatibility between Islam and the West , and so no inevitable collision .
Problems arise from intolerant minorities - on both sides - rather than from cultures as a whole .
Muslims will welcome the finding that tensions are the result of conflicts over political power and interests , rather than differences of religion or culture .
They often argue that Muslim radicalism is the product of global inequalities of wealth and power - and Western foreign policy in Iraq , Afghanistan , Israel / Palestine and elsewhere .
The large Muslim minorities now living in the West also argue they are the victims of social disadvantage and " Islamophobic " prejudice .
Bucking the trend
Polls , however , need careful reading .
The BBC poll suggests significant numbers of people do not share the broadly optimistic view of the majority .
It is worth noting that most victims of Islamic intolerance and terrorism are Muslims themselves .
Anon , UK
Send us your comments
Kenyans and Poles are ambivalent .
A slight majority of Indonesians think violent conflict between Islam and the West is inevitable .
While 49 % of Americans believe there are political reasons for tensions between Islam and the West , 38 % believe they result from differences of religion and culture .
So the picture is mixed , and perhaps this is not surprising .
Polarisation
The current global climate is one of polarisation .
Many Muslims are angry about Iraq and Palestine and what they perceive as a Western drive for hegemony .
Since 9/11 , the West has been nervous about the al - Qaeda threat .
The Madrid and London bombings kept that threat alive .
The sense of polarisation has been sharpened by recent controversies - over Danish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed , over the Pope 's remarks about Islam , over whether face - veils hinder integration .
All these things have set relations between Islam and the West on edge .
Many Muslims , and some non-Muslims , blame the media for fanning the flames .
In a wired - up world , local disputes can quickly become global ones .
Most people , when asked , are likely to favour co-existence and tolerance .
But at moments of crisis , they do not always practise them .

Worst Excuse of the Day
If you have n't seen the photo of Romney holding up a sign that said " Obama Osama , " you can see it here .
Now you can read , via Eric Kleefeld , the worst excuse of the day :
Election Central contacted Romney spokesman Kevin Madden for comment , asking if it was appropriate for the candidate to hold the sign up with the woman .
" The governor stopped briefly for a picture with a supporter who just happened to be holding their own sign with an alliterative play on words , " Madden said , via e-mail .
" I do n’t think it was equating or comparing anyone . "
Say whaaaaat ?
So there is today 's worst excuse of the day .
Anyone who knew him , he told reporter Louie Robinson , would immediately recognize that he could never have uttered those words .
Amid testimonials from black people who did know him , he described his attendance as a teenager at the church of celebrated black gospel composer , the Rev. W. Herbert Brewster , whose songs had been recorded by Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward and whose stand on civil rights was well known in the community .
( Elvis ’s version of “ Peace in the Valley , ” said Dr. Brewster later , was “ one of the best gospel recordings I ’ve ever heard . ” )
The interview ’s underlying point was the same as the underlying point of his music : far from asserting any superiority , he was merely doing his best to find a place in a musical continuum that included breathtaking talents like Ray Charles , Roy Hamilton , the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and Howlin ’
Wolf on the one hand , Hank Williams , Bill Monroe and the Statesmen Quartet on the other .
“ Let ’s face it , ” he said of his rhythm and blues influences , “ nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people .
I ca n’t sing it like Fats Domino can .
I know that . ”
And as for prejudice , the article concluded , quoting an unnamed source , “ To Elvis people are people , regardless of race , color or creed . ”
So why did n’t the rumor die ?
Why did it continue to find common acceptance up to , and past , the point that Chuck D of Public Enemy could declare in 1990 , “ Elvis was a hero to most ... straight - up racist that sucker was , simple and plain ” ?
Chuck D has long since repudiated that view for a more nuanced one of cultural history , but the reason for the rumor ’s durability , the unassailable logic behind its common acceptance within the black community rests quite simply on the social inequities that have persisted to this day , the fact that we live in a society that is no more perfectly democratic today than it was 50 years ago .
As Chuck D perceptively observes , what does it mean , within this context , for Elvis to be hailed as “ king , ” if Elvis ’s enthronement obscures the striving , the aspirations and achievements of so many others who provided him with inspiration ?
Elvis would have been the first to agree .
When a reporter referred to him as the “ king of rock ’ n ’ roll ” at the press conference following his 1969 Las Vegas opening , he rejected the title , as he always did , calling attention to the presence in the room of his friend Fats Domino , “ one of my influences from way back . ”
The larger point , of course , was that no one should be called king ; surely the music , the American musical tradition that Elvis so strongly embraced , could stand on its own by now , after crossing all borders of race , class and even nationality .
“ The lack of prejudice on the part of Elvis Presley , ” said Sam Phillips , the Sun Records founder who discovered him , “ had to be one of the biggest things that ever happened .
It was almost subversive , sneaking around through the music , but we hit things a little bit , do n’t you think ? ”
On the very day before the British documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle is to hit Aussie TV screens , the Royal Society has published the work of 2 scientists who claim to have disproved its core position - that the actions of the sun , not humans , cause global warming .
And , unlike the countless studies which support solar forcing theories , this one you most definitely WILL be hearing about from the mainstream media .
Following a week of press leaks , Mike Lockwood and Claus Fröhlich have submitted a paper to Proceedings of the Royal Society A , which admits that :
" There is considerable evidence for solar influence on the Earth 's pre-industrial climate and the Sun may well have been a factor in post - industrial climate change in the first half of the last century . "
However , observe they , the sun 's magnetic field has declined since 1985 , even as the world heats up .
It is the " rapid rise in global mean temperatures " during this 22 year period ALONE which they claim " cannot be ascribed to solar variability . "
Imagine that -- less than a quarter of a century ?
Even though old Sol has been bombarding us with its warming rays for over 4.5 billion years and clear Sun / Climate correlations have been observed spanning millennia .
Of course , it will take a little time for fellow scientists to absorb , analyze and respond to their 14 page report , right ?
Well , not quite - particularly when there 's a pesky contrarian opinion about to be broadcast to a new continent of potential Gore - bots the very next day .
So , faster than you can say " Solar Resonant Diffusion Waves , " University of Melbourne climate scientist David Karoly smugly blurted out that [ emphasis added ] :
" These findings completely refute the allegations made by some pseudo - scientists that all recent global warming is due to solar effects . "
Incidentally , Dr. Karoly will be joining a panel arguing the assertions of the documentary immediately following its broadcast on Australia 's ABC Thursday night .
Any guesses which side the longtime IPCC contributor might be taking ?
And Stefan Rahmstorf , who once referred to awful The Day After Tomorrow scriptwriter Jeffrey Nachmanoff as " well - informed about the science and politics of global climate change , " did n't let any ice melt under his feet either .
The ever - alarmed climate scientist from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany claimed an immediate , albeit macabre , victory :
" This paper is the final nail in the coffin for people who would like to make the sun responsible for present global warming "
Ouch -- final nail in the coffin ?
Sure , enviro- mental - case Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently referred to AGW skeptics as traitors , but do he and his fellow alarmists really want us all stood up against a wall and offered a last big - bad - industry - pushed cancer - causing smoke ?
Meanwhile , right on cue and despite the fact that these were the freshly published opinions of but 2 men ( enough for a consensus ? ) , eager Greenhouse Gas passers set to work on triumphant headlines , exemplified by :
Not surprisingly , little such fanfare was awarded last month 's fine work by noted Paleoclimatologist R. Timothy Patterson or the myriad others that tell the exact opposite story .
But then , why would there be ?
The sheer simplicity of solar impact makes it public enemy number one to the scare - mongers .
Last weekend 's dismal Live Earth concerts were yet another attempt to forward the green agenda and silence dissent - this time with thunderous overture , silly mantras put to driving beats , and flash - in - the - pan special effects .
Now it seems they fear the truth that one well - made documentary might convey and , therefore , feel the need to squash it with more pageantry .
How pathetic .
Why does anyone think this makes security sense ?
The Justice Department ’s proposed budget for 2008 reveals for the first time how often names match against the database , reporting that there were 19,967 “ positive matches ” in 2006 .
The TSC had expected to match a far fewer number 14,780 .
The watch list matched people 5,396 and 15,730 times in 2004 and 2005 respectively .
The report defines a positive match as “ one in which an encountered individual is positively matched with an identity in the Terrorist Screening Data Base , or TSDB . ”
It ’s not clear from the report whether those numbers include individuals whose names only coincidently match one of those on list , such as when Sen .
Ted Kennedy was confused with a former IRA terrorist also named Kennedy .
The watch list has been hounded by these mismatches , which have included small children , former presidential candidates , and Americans with common names such as David Nelson .
Thousands of people in Britain and around the world are dying prematurely from heart disease triggered by long - term exposure to excessive noise , according to research by the World Health Organisation .
Coronary heart disease caused 101,000 deaths in the UK in 2006 , and the study suggests that 3,030 of these are caused by chronic noise exposure , including to daytime traffic .
Deepak Prasher , professor of audiology at University College London , told the New Scientist magazine : " The new data provide the link showing there are earlier deaths because of noise .
Until now , noise has been the Cinderella form of pollution and people have n't been aware that it has an impact on their health . "
The WHO 's working group on the Noise Environmental Burden on Disease began work on the health effects of noise in Europe in 2003 .
In addition to the heart disease link , it found that 2 % of Europeans suffer severely disturbed sleep because of noise pollution and 15 % can suffer severe annoyance .
Chronic exposure to loud traffic noise causes 3 % of tinnitus cases , in which people constantly hear a noise in their ears .
Research published in recent years has shown that noise can increase the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol , adrenaline and noradrenalin in the body , even during sleep .
The longer these hormones stay in circulation around the bloodstream , the more likely they are to cause life - threatening physiological problems .
High stress levels can lead to heart failure , strokes , high blood pressure and immune problems .
" All this is happening imperceptibly , " said Prof Prasher .
" Even when you think you are used to the noise , these physiological changes are still happening . "
The WHO came to its figures by comparing households with abnormally high exposure to noise with those in quieter homes .
It also studied people with problems such as coronary heart disease and tried to work out if high noise levels had been a factor in developing the condition .
This data was then combined with maps showing the noisiest European cities .
According to the WHO guidelines , the noise threshold for cardiovascular problems is chronic night - time exposure of 50 decibels ( dB ) or above - the noise of light traffic .
For sleep disturbance , the threshold is 42dB , for general annoyance it is 35dB , the sound of a whisper .
Ellen Mason , a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation , said : " Our world is undoubtedly getting busier and noisier .
Some people find noise pollution more stressful to live with than others do .
Noise cannot directly kill us , but it may add to our stress .
Occasionally , stressful events can trigger a heart attack in someone with underlying heart disease .
We know that stressed people are more likely to eat unhealthily , exercise less and smoke more , and these can increase the risk of developing heart disease in the first place . "
Mary Stevens , policy officer at the National Society for Clean Air , said of the study 's results : " We welcome this because one of the problems with noise is that it's one of the areas that local authorities get most complaints about and it's a big draw on their resources .
But , unlike air quality , it has n't been taken that seriously policy - wise because there [ was n't ] the link between noise and health . "
Ms Stevens said that there were many options for reducing noise .
Traffic could be quietened if more cars used low - noise tyres and councils installed low - noise road surfaces , for example .
And coordinating roadworks by utility companies would also prevent the proliferation of potholes , another source of noisy traffic .
The EU has already issued a directive that obligates European cities with populations greater than 250,000 to produce digitised noise maps showing where traffic noise and volume is greatest .
" [ The research ] all supports work going on at the moment to manage traffic noise , which is driven by the environmental noise directive , " said Ms Stevens .
The Iraqi government has hit upon a novel idea to improve security in the country .
Arming the citizenry .
The call for civilians to take up arms in their own defense was echoed Sunday by the country ’s Sunni Arab vice president , Tariq al - Hashemi .
“ People have a right to expect from the government and security agencies protection for their lives , land , honor and property , ” al - Hashemi said in a statement .
“ But in the case of ( their ) inability , the people have no choice but to take up their own defense . ”
Now many Americans might be confused by this statement .
After all , is n’t Iraq awash with weapons ?
Are n’t the armed people the cause of the instability ?
What is this all about ?
This actually represents a massive change in a policy toward personal protection , a policy imposed by the U.S. army in 2003 that , I think , played a significant role in the U.S. defeat in Iraq .
The policy imposed by the U.S. government was simply this .
Every household could own an AK - 47 or similar rifle for self - defense .
If a civilian carries the weapon in public , U. S. forces can kill him without warning .
The only Iraqis allowed to go out armed are government officials , army officers , or police .
Local militias are banned .
In effect , this is a slightly less restrictive law than the DC gun control law , and it has the same effect : it leaves the common man and woman at the mercy of criminals .
When locals understandably form militias to defend their neighborhoods , they become targets for U.S. government attack .
Their attackers , who tend to be members of militias dedicated to some sectarian cause can operate with near impunity ; they have safe zones where they can refit unmolested by U.S. soldiers or the Iraqi government , in some cases they even are part of the Iraqi government .
The U.S. government policy throughout the post war period has been to promote a strong centralized state at the expense of the common man .
This has manifested itself in such bizarre actions as pursuing illegal suppliers of electricity ( who use generators to supply power to neighborhoods ) , gasoline black - marketers ( the U.S. price controls on gasoline have caused massive shortages ) .
In doing so , they have worked decisively to lose whatever support the Iraqi population might have had for the U.S. occupation .
It is no wonder that 90 % of the Iraqi populace wants the U.S. government out of Iraq .
They are fed up with an organization that sends armed men blundering through their homes , depriving them of access to electricity , undermining their security and killing them by mistake .
With the U.S. out of the way , they know that the current Iraqi government would collapse quickly .
And the residents would no longer have to fear two entities that actively work against their security .
Encouraging the citizenry to arm themselves , permitting them to publicly bear arms without fear of being killed is an absolutely necessary step to rebuilding a peaceful society in Iraq .
It ’s a pity that it has taken 4 years for the U.S. government to permit this .
The Money Myth Myth Exploded The Financial Enigma Resolved -- A Debt -Money System by Louis Even " Social Credit considers realities .
It refuses to be hypnotized by the halo with which finance has been surrounded .
The economic realities are , on one hand , the production ; not only the existing production , but the production immediately possible , the production capacity ; and they are , on the other hand , the human needs .
Social Credit gives priority to the realities over the financial signs that are not realities , that must simply represent , and faithfully represent , the realities .
This is why Social Credit makes a distinction between real credit ( a reality ) and financial credit ( a representation ) .
The word " credit " comes from the Latin word " credere " and bears the idea of confidence .
Even in everyday language , to give credit to someone , is it not to indicate that we have confidence in him ? "
Above Quote is taken from the essay , " From Parable to Reality " by Louis Even , which follows the cartoon parable below .
( Network America Editor 's prefatory note : Mr. Even 's explanation of the origin of the word " credit " is obvious , for instance , when we think of the granting of low interest credit cards , even high interest credit cards , and other forms of financial credit so common in our society today , the granting of which indicates a degree of confidence in the person who receives the credit card or other forms of financial credit .
All of these are looked at as " real credit " today in the societies of the 21st century .
But Louis Even goes beyond the common modern understanding to explain " real credit " vs. " financial credit , and many other concepts critical to understanding " money " , -- so be sure to read the parable AND the essays which follow to understand clearly all the distinctions being made by Mr. Even , and you will be rewarded with a real understanding of how our economy is being run today , as well as how it SHOULD work in a better world ) .

1. Shipwreck survivors
An explosion had blown their ship apart .
Each one grasped the first bit of wreckage that came to hand .
And when it was over , there were five left , five huddled on a raft which the waves carried along at their will .
As for the other victims of the disaster , there was no sign of them .
Hour after long hour their eyes searched the horizon .
Would some passing ship sight them ?
Would their make - shift raft finds its way to some friendly shore ?
Suddenly a cry rang out : " Land !
Look !
Over there , in the direction the waves are carrying us ! "
And as the vague silhouette proved itself to be , in fact , the outline of a shore , the figures on the raft danced with joy .
They were five , five Canadians , as in the picture opposite .
There was Frank , the carpenter , big and energetic .
It was he who had first cried , " Land ! " .
Then Paul , a farmer .
You can see him , front and left in the picture , on his knees , one hand against the floor , the other gripping the mast of the raft .
Next is Jim , an animal breeder ; he 's the one in the striped pants , kneeling and gazing in the direction of land .
Then there is Harry , an agriculturist , a little on the stout side , seated on a trunk salvaged from the wreck .
And finally Tom , a prospector and a mineralogist ; he is the merry fellow standing in the rear of the picture with his hand on the carpenter 's shoulder .
2. A Providential island
To our five men , setting foot on land was like returning to life from the grave .
When they had dried and warmed themselves their first impulse was to explore this little island on to which they had been cast , far from civilization .
A quick survey was sufficient to raise their spirit .
The island was not a barren rock .
True enough , they were the only men on it at the moment .
But judging from the herds of semi- domesticated animals they encountered , there must have been men here at some time before them .
Jim , the animal breeder , was sure he could completely domesticate them and put them to good service .
Paul found the island 's soil , for the most part , to be quite suitable for cultivation .
Harry discovered some fruit trees which , if properly tended , would give good harvests .
Most important were the large stands of timber embracing many types of wood .
Frank , without too much difficulty , would be able to build houses for the little community .
As for Tom , the prospector , well , the rock formations of the island showed signs of rich mineral deposits .
Lacking the tools ,
Tom still felt his ingenuity and initiative could produce metals from the ores .
So each could serve the common good with his special talent .
All agreed to call the place Salvation Island .
All gave thanks to Providence for the reasonably happy ending to what could have been stark tragedy .
3 . True wealth
Here are the men at work .
The carpenter builds houses and makes furniture .
At first they find their food where they can .
But soon the fields are tilled and seeded , and the farmer has his crops .
As season followed season this island , this heritage of the five men , Salvation Island , became richer and richer .
Its wealth was not that of gold or of paper bank notes , but one of true value ; a wealth of food and clothing and shelter , of all the things to meet human needs .
Each man worked at his own trade .
Whatever surpluses he might have of his own produce , he exchanged for the surplus products of the others .
Life was n't always as smooth and complete as they could have wished it to be .
They lacked many of the things to which they had been accustomed in civilization .
But their lot could have been a great deal worse .
Besides , all had experienced the depression in Canada .
They still remembered the empty bellies side by side with stores crammed with food .
At least , on Salvation Island , they were n't forced to see the things they needed rot before their eyes .
Taxes were unknown here .
Nor did they go in constant fear of seizure by the bailiff .
They worked hard but at least they could enjoy the fruits of their toil .
So they developed the island , thanking God and hoping for the day of reunion with their families , still in possession of life and health , those two greatest of blessings .
4 . A serious inconvenience
Our men often got together to talk over their affairs .
Under the simple economic system which had developed , one thing was beginning to bother then more and more ; they had no form of money .
Barter , the direct exchange of goods for goods , had its drawbacks .
The products to be exchanged were not always at hand when a trade was discussed .
For example , wood delivered to the farmer in winter could not be paid for in potatoes until six months later .
Sometimes one man might have an article of considerable size which he wished to exchange for a number of smaller articles produced by different men at different times .
All this complicated business and laid a heavy burden on the memory .
With a monetary system , however , each one could sell his products to the others for money .
With this money he could buy from the others the things he wanted , when he wished and when they were available .
It was agreed that a system of money would indeed be very convenient .
But none of them knew how to set up such a system .
They knew how to produce true wealth - goods .
But how to produce money , the symbol of this wealth , was something quite beyond them .
They were ignorant of the origin of money , and needing it they did n't know how to produce it .
Certainly , many men of education would have been in the same boat ; all our governments were in that predicament during the ten years prior to the war .
The only thing the country lacked at that time was money , and the governments apparently did n't know what to do to get it .
5. Arrival of a refugee
One evening , when our boys were sitting on the beach going over their problem for the hundredth time .
they suddenly saw approaching , a small boat with a solitary man at the oars .
They learned that he was a refugee from war - torn , central Europe .
Along with other emigrants he had boarded a ship bound for Australia .
A storm had driven their ship on to a reef .
He was the only survivor of the wreck .
His name , Oliver Glucksterlingmann .
They could remember only his first name .
Delighted to have a new companion , they provide him with the best they had and took him on an inspection tour of the colony .
" Even though we 're lost and cut off from the rest of the world , " they told him , " we have n't too much to complain about .
The earth and the forest are good to us .
We lack only one thing - money .
That would make it easier for us to exchange our products . "
" Well , you can thank Providence , " replied Oliver , '' because I am a banker and in no time at all I 'll set up a system of money guaranteed to satisfy you .
Then you 'll have everything that people in civilization have .
A banker !...
A BANKER ! ...
An angel coming down out of the clouds could n't have inspired more reverence and respect in our men .
For , after all , are we not accustomed , we people in civilization , to genuflect before bankers , those men who control the life - blood of finance ?
6. Civilization 's god Mr. Oliver , as our banker , your only occupation on this island will be to look after our money ; no manual labour . "
" I shall , like every other banker , carry out to complete satisfaction my task of forging the community 's prosperity . "
" Mr. Oliver , we 're going to build you a house that will be in keeping with your dignity as a banker .
But in the meantime , do you mind if we lodge you in the building we use for our get - togethers ? "
" That will suit me , my friends .
But first of all , unload the boat .
There 's paper , and a printing press complete with ink and type ; and there 's a little barrel which I exhort you to treat with the greatest care . "
They unloaded everything .
The small barrel aroused intense curiosity in our good fellows .
" This barrel , Oliver announced , " contains treasure beyond dreams .
It is full of . . . gold ! "
Full of gold !
The five all but swooned .
The god of civilization here on Salvation Island !
The yellow god , always hidden , yet terrible in its power ; whose presence or absence or slightest caprice could decide the very fate of all the civilized nations !
" Gold !
Mr. Oliver , you are indeed a great banker ! "
" Oh august majesty ! oh honorable Oliver !
great high priest of the god , gold !
accept our humble homage and receive our oaths of fealty ! "
" Yes , my friends , gold enough for a continent .
But gold is not for circulation .
Gold must be hidden .
Gold is the soul of healthy money , and the soul is always invisible .
But I 'll explain all that when you receive your first supply of money . " .
7 . The secret burial
Before they went their separate ways for the night , Oliver asked them one last question .
" How much money will you need to begin with in order to facilitate trading ? "
They looked at one another then deferentially towards the banker .
After a bit of calculation and with the advice of the kindly financier , they decided that $ 200 each would do .
The men parted , exchanging enthusiastic comments .
And in spite of the late hour , they spent most of the night lying awake , their imaginations excited by the picture of gold .
It was morning before they slept .
As for Oliver , he wasted not a moment .
Fatigue was forgotten in the interests of his future as a banker .
By dawn 's first light he dug a pit into which he rolled the barrel .
He then filled it in , transplanting a small shrub to the spot about which he carefully arranged sod .
It was well hidden .
Then he went to work with his little press to turn out a thousand $ 1 bills .
Watching the clean new banknotes come from his press , the emigrant turned banker , thought to himself : " My ! how simple it is to make money .
All its value come from the products it will buy .
Without produce these bills are worthless .
My five naive customers do n't realize that .
They actually think that this new money derives its value from gold !
Their very ignorance makes me their master . "
And as evening drew on , the five came to Oliver - on the run .
8 . Who owns the new money Five bundles of new banknotes were sitting on the table .
" Before distributing the money , " said the banker , " I would like your attention .
" Now , the basis of all money is gold .
And the gold stored away in the vault of my bank is my gold .
Consequently , the money is my money .
Oh !
do n't look so discouraged .
I 'm going to lend you this money and you 're going to use it as you see fit .
However , you 'll have to pay interest .
Considering that money is scarce here , I do n't think 8 % is unreasonable . "
" Oh , that 's quite reasonable , Mr. Oliver . "
" One last point , my friends .
Business is business , even between pals .
Before you get the money , each of you is going to sign a paper .
By it you will bind yourselves to pay both interest and capital under penalty of confiscation of property by me .
Oh !
this is a mere formality .
Your property is of no interest to me .
I 'm satisfied with money .
And I feel sure I 'll get my money and that you 'll keep your property . "
" That makes sense , Mr. Oliver .
We 're going to work harder than ever in order to pay you back . "
" That 's the spirit .
And any time you have a problem , come and see me .
Your banker is your best friend .
Now , here 's two hundred dollars for each of you . "
And our five brave fellows went away , their hands full of dollar bills , their heads swimming with the ecstasy of having money .
9 . A problem in arithmetic And so Oliver 's money went into circulation on the island .
Trade , simplified by money , doubled .
Everybody was happy .
And the banker was always greeted with unfailing respect and gratitude .
But now , let 's see ...
Why does Tom , the prospector , look so grave as he sits busily figuring with a pencil and paper ?
It is because Tom , like the others , has signed an agreement to repay Oliver , in one year 's time , the $ 200 plus $ 16 interest .
But Tom has only a few dollars in his pocket and the date of payment is near .
For a long time he wrestled with the problem from his own personal point of view , without success .
Finally he looked at it from the angle of the little community as a whole .
" Taking into consideration everyone on the island , as a whole , he mused , " are we capable of meeting our obligations ?
Oliver turned out a total of $ 1000 .
He 's asking in return $ 1080 .
But even if we bring him his every dollar bill on the island we 'll still be $ 80 short .
Nobody made the extra $ 80 .
We turn out produce , not dollar bills .
So Oliver can take over the entire island since all the inhabitants together can't pay him back the total amount of capital and interest .
" Even if a few , without any thought for the others , were able to do so , those others would fall .
And the turn of the first spared would come eventually .
The banker will have everything .
We 'd better hold a meeting right away and decide what to do about it . "
Tom , with his figures in his hand , had no difficulty in proving the situation .
All agreed they had been duped by the kindly banker .
They decided upon a meeting at Oliver 's .
10 .
The benevolent banker Oliver guessed what was on their minds but put up his best front .
While he listened , the impetuous Frank stated the case for the group .
" How can we pay you $ 1080 when there is only $ 1000 on the entire island ? "
" That 's the interest , my friends .
Has n't your rate of production increased ? "
" Sure , but the money has n't .
And it 's money you 're asking for , not our products .
You are the only one who can make money .
You 've made only $ 1000 and yet you ask ; $ 1080 .
That 's an impossibility ! "
" Now listen .
fellows .
Bankers , for the greater good of community , always adapt themselves to the conditions of the times .
I 'm going to require only the interest .
Only $ 80 .
You will go on holding the capital . ''
" Bless you , Mr. Oliver !
Are you going , to cancel the $ 200 each of us owes you ? "
" Oh no !
I 'm sorry , but a banker never cancels a debt .
You still owe me all the money you borrowed .
But you 'll pay me , each year , only the interest .
If you meet the interest payments faithfully each year I wo n't push for the capital .
Maybe some wo n't be able to repay even the interest because of the money changing hands among you .
Well , organize yourselves like a nation .
Set up a system of money contributions , what we call taxes .
Those who have more money will be taxed more : the poor will pay less .
See to it that you bring me , in one lump sum , the total of the amount of interest and I 'll be satisfied .
And your little nation will
thrive . "
So our boys left , somewhat pacified but still dubious .
11 . Oliver Glucksterlingmann exults
Oliver is alone .
He is deep in reflection .
His thoughts run thus : " Business is good .
These boys are good workers , but stupid .
Their ignorance and naivety is my strength .
They ask for money and I give them chains of bondage .
They give me orchids and I pick their pockets .
" True enough , they could mutiny and throw me into the sea .
But pshaw !
I have their signatures .
They 're good Christians .
They 're honest .
They 'll honor their pledges .
Honest , hardworking people were put into this world to serve the financiers .
" Oh great Rothchild !
I feel your banking genius coursing through my entire being !
Oh , illustrious master !
how right you were when you said : " Give me control of a nation 's money and I wo n't mind who makes its laws . "
I am the master of Salvation Island because I control its money .
" My soul is drunk with enthusiasm and ambition .
I feel I could rule the universe .
What I , Oliver Glucksterlingmann , have done here , I can do throughout the entire world .
Oh !
if only I could get off this island !
I know how I could govern the world without wearing a crown .
My supreme delight would instill my philosophy in the mind of those who lead society ; bankers , industrialists , politicians , reformers , teachers , journalists , - all would be my servants .
The masses are content to live in slavery when the elite from among them are constitute their overseers . "
And so the entire philosophy of banking , that spawn of Rothschild , was summed up in this ecstasy of Oliver Glucksterlingmann .
12 . The cost of living unbearable Meanwhile things went from bad to worse on Salvation Island .
Production was up , bartering had dropped to a minimum .
Oliver collected his interest regularly .
The others had to think of setting money aside for him .
Thus , money tended to clot instead of circulating freely .
Those who paid the most in taxes complained against those who paid less .
They raised the prices of their goods to compensate for this loss .
The unfortunate poor who paid no taxes lamented the high cost of living and bought less .
If one took a salaried job with another he was continually demanding increases in salary in order to meet the mounting cost of living .
Morale was low .
The joy went out of living .
No one took an interest in his work .
Why should he ?
Produce sold poorly .
When they made a sale they had to pay taxes to Oliver .
They went without things .
It was a real crisis .
And they accused one another of wanting in charity and of being the cause of the high cost of living .
One day , Harry , sitting in his orchard , pondered over the situation .
He finally arrived at the conclusion that this " progress " , born of a refugee 's monetary system , had spoiled everything on the island .
Unquestionably all five had their faults ; but Oliver 's system seemed to have been specifically designed to bring out the worst in human nature .
Harry decided to demonstrate this to his friends and to unite them for action .
He started with Jim , who was not hard to convince .
" I 'm no genius " , he said , " but for a long time now there 's been a bad smell about this foreigner 's system . "
One by one they came to the same conclusion and ended by deciding upon another conference with Oliver .
13 . Interview with the enshackler A veritable tempest burst about the ears of the banker .
" Money 's scarce on the island , fellow , because you take it away from us !
We pay you and pay you and still owe you as much as at the beginning .
We work our heads off !
We 've the finest land possible and yet we 're worse off than before the day of your arrival .
Debts !
Debts !
up to our necks in debts ! "
" Oh ! now boys , be reasonable !
Your affairs are booming and it's thanks to me .
A good banking system is a country 's best asset .
But if it is to work beneficially you must have faith in the banker .
Come to me as you would to a father . . . is it more money you want ?
Very well .
My barrel of gold is good for many thousands of dollars more .
See , I 'm going to mortgage your latest acquisitions and lend you another thousand dollars right now . "
" So !
Now our debt goes up to $ 2,000 !
We are going to have twice as much interest to pay for the rest of our lives ! "
Well , yes - but I 'll lend you more whenever the value of your property increases .
And you 'll never pay anything but the interest .
You 'll lump all your debts into one - what we call consolidated debt .
And you can add to the debt year after year . "
" And raise the taxes year after year ?. "
" Obviously .
But your revenues also increase every year " .
" So then , the more the country develops each year because of our labor , the more the public debt increases ! "
" Why , of course !
Just as in your Canada - or in any other part of the civilized world for that matter .
The degree of a country 's civilization is always gauged by the size of its debt to the bankers " .
14 .
The wolf devours the lambs " And that 's a healthy monetary system , Mr. Oliver ? "
Gentlemen , all sound money is based on gold and it come from the banks in the form of debts .
The national debt is a good thing .
It keeps men from becoming too satisfied .
It subjugates governments to the supreme and ultimate wisdom , that which is incarnate in bankers .
As a banker , I am the torch of civilization here on your little island .
I will dictate your politics and regulate your standard of living . "
" Mr. Oliver , we 're simple uneducated folks , but we do n't want that kind of civilization here .
We 'll not borrow another cent off you .
Sound money or not , we do n't want any further transactions with you . "
" Gentlemen , I deeply regret this very ill - advised decision of yours .
But if you break with me , remember , I have your signatures .
Repay me everything at once - capital and interest . "
" But that 's impossible , sir .
Even if we give you all the money on the island we still wo n't be square with you .
" I can't help that .
Did you or did you not sign ?
Yes ?
Very well .
By virtue of the sanctity of contracts I hereby seize your mortgaged property which was what you agreed to at the time you were so happy to have my help .
If you do n't want to serve willingly the supreme authority of money then you 'll obey force .
You 'll continue to exploit the island , but in my interests and under my conditions .
Now , get out !
You 'll get your orders from me tomorrow . "
15 . Control of the press Like Rothschild , Oliver knew that whoever controlled the nation 's money , controlled the nation .
But he knew also that to maintain that control it was necessary to keep the people in a state of ignorance and to distract them by a variety of means .
Oliver had observed that of the five islanders , two were conservatives and three were liberals .
That much had evolved from their evening conversations , especially after they had fallen into slavery .
And between the conservatives and those who were liberals there was constant friction .
On occasions , Harry , the most neutral of the five , considering that all had the same needs and aspirations , had suggested a Union of Electors .
Such a union , Oliver could not tolerate ; it would mean the end of his rule .
No dictator , financial or otherwise , could stand before a people united and educated .
Consequently Oliver set himself to foment , as much as possible , political strife between them .
The refugee put his press to work turning out two weekly newspapers , THE SUN for the liberals and THE STAR for the conservatives .
The general tenor of THE SUN was : " If you are no longer master , it is because of those traitorous conservatives who have sold out to the big business .
That of THE STAR : " The ruinous state of business and the national debt can be traced directly to the political irresponsibility of those unmentionable liberals " .
And the two factions wrangled ferociously , forgetting the one who had forged their chains , that money master , the banker Oliver .
16 . A priceless bit of flotsam
One day , Tom , the prospector , discovered on a small beach hidden by tall grass at one end of the island , a lifeboat , empty except for a trunk in good condition lying in the bottom of it .
He opened the trunk .
Among the articles within , a sort of album caught his eye : " Premiere année de Vers Demain " .
Between the covers he found the first Volume of a Social Credit publication from Canada .
Tom could read French .
Curious , he sat down - and began to read the volume .
His interest grew ; his face lit up .
" Well just look at this ! " he cried out loud " This is something we should have known a long time ago . "
" Money gets its value , not from gold but from the products which that money buys . "
Simply put , money should be a sort of accountancy , credits passing from one account to another according to purchases and sales .
The sum total of money will depend upon the sum total of production .
" Each time production increases there is a corresponding increase in the amount of money .
Never at any time should interest be paid on new money .
Progress is marked , not by an increase in the public debt , but by the issuance of an equal dividend to each individual ...
Prices are adjusted to the general purchasing power by a coefficient of prices .
Social Credit . . . "
But Tom could no longer contain himself .
He got up and set off at a run , the book in his hands , to share this glorious discovery with his four comrades .
17 . Money - elementary accounting So Tom became the teacher .
He taught the others what he had learned from that God-sent Social Credit publication .
" This " , he said " is what we can do without waiting for a banker and his keg of gold or without underwriting a debt .
" I open an account in the name of each of you .
In the right hand column are the credits which increase your account ; to the left are the debits which subtract from your account .
" Each wants $ 200 to begin with .
Very well .
We write $ 200 to the credit of each .
Each immediately has $ 200 .
" Frank buys some goods from Paul for $ 10 .
I deduct $ 10 from Frank leaving him $ 190 .
I add $ 10 to Paul and he now has $ 210 .
" Jim buys from Paul to the amount of $ 8 .
I deduct from Jim $ 8 leaving him $ 192 .
Paul now has $ 218 .
" Paul buys wood from Frank for $ 15 .
I deduct $ 15 from Paul leaving $ 203 .
I add 15 to Frank 's account and it goes back to $ 205 .
And so we continue ; from one account to another in the same fashion as paper banknotes go from one man 's pocket to another's .
" If someone needs money to expand production , we issue him the necessary amount of new credit .
Once he has sold his products he repays the sum to the credit fund .
The same with public works ; paid for by new credits .
" Likewise , each one 's account is periodically increased but without taking credits from anyone , in order that all may benefit from the progress society makes .
That 's the national dividend .
In this fashion money becomes an instrument of service . "
18 .
The banker 's despair Everyone understood .
The members of this little community became Crediters .
The following day , Oliver , the banker received a letter signed by the five : " Dear sir .
without the slightest necessity you have plunged us into debt and exploited us .
We do n't need you anymore to run our money system .
From now on we 'll have all the money we need without your gold , debts or thieves .
We are establishing , at once , the system of Social Credit on the island .
The national dividend is going to replace the national debt .
" If you insist on being repaid , we can repay you all the money you gave us .
But not a cent more .
You can't lay claim to that which you have not made .
" We have nothing against you as a foreigner .
We respect every human being .
But we reject your mentality and philosophy .
And we will not permit anyone to regiment and exploit us .
Oliver was in despair .
His empire was crumbling .
His dreams shattered .
What could he do ?
Argument would be futile .
The five were now Crediters ; money and credit were now not more mysterious to them than they were to Oliver .
" Oh ! esteemed Rothchild !
What will become of your disciple ?
These men have been won to Social Credit .
Their doctrine will spread far more quickly than mine .
Should I beg forgiveness ?
become one of them ?
I , a financier and a banker ?
Never !
Rather , I shall try and put as much distance between them and me as I can ! " 19 .
Fraud unmasked
To protect themselves against any future claim by Oliver , our five men decided to make him sign a document attesting that he again possessed all he had when he first arrived on the island .
An inventory was taken ; the boat , the oars , the little press and the famous barrel of gold .
Oliver had to reveal where he had hidden the gold .
Our boys hoisted it from the hole with considerably less respect than the day they had unloaded it from the boat .
Social Credit had taught them to despise gold .
The prospector , who was helping to lift the barrel , found it surprisingly light for gold .
If the barrel was full , he told the others , there was something in it besides gold .
The impetuous Frank did n't waste a moment ; a blow of the axe and the contents of the barrel were exposed .
Gold ?
Not so much as a grain of it !
Just rocks - plain , worthless rocks !
Our men could n't get over the shock .
" Do n't tell us he could bamboozle us to this extent ! "
" Were we such muttonheads as to go into raptures over the mere mention of gold ? "
" Did we morgage all our possessions for a few pieces of paper based on a few pounds of rocks ?
It 's robbery compounded by lies ! "
" To think that we sulked and almost hated one another all because of such a fraud !
That devil ! "
Furious , Frank raised his axe .
But already the banker had taken to his legs in full flight towards the forest .
20 . Farewell to Salvation Island
After the opening of the barrel and the revelation of his duplicity , nothing , further was heard of Oliver Glucksterlingmann .
Shortly after , a ship , cruising off ' the normal navigation route , noticed signs of life on this uncharted island and cast anchor a short distance offshore .
The men learned that the ship was en route to America .
So they decided to take with them what they could carry and return to Canada .
Above all , they made sure to take back with them the album " The First Year of Social Credit " which had proven to be their salvation from the hands of the financier , Oliver , and which had illumined their minds with an inextinguishable light .
All five solemnly engaged themselves to get in touch with the management of this paper , once back in Canada , and to become devoted and zealous apostles of the cause of Social Credit in Canada .

From parable to reality 1 : A Debt money system
The debt money system introduced by Oliver into the Salvation Island made the little community sink into financial debt in proportion as it developed and enriched the island by its own work .
This is exactly what happens in our civilized countries , is it not ?
Canada of today is certainly richer , in real wealth , than it was 50 , 100 years ago , or in the pioneers ' age .
But compare the national debt , the sum of all public debts of Canada today with this sum 50,100 years , three centuries ago !
Yet the Canadians themselves produced this enrichment by their labour and their know - how .
Then why should they be collectively indebted for the result of their own activities ?
As examples , consider the schools , the municipal aqueducts , the bridges , roads and other fabrics of public character .
Who build them all ?
Builders of the country .
Who supply them with the needed materials ?
Manufacturers of the country .
And how come they can be employed in public works ?
Because there are other kinds of workers who produce food , clothes , shoes , who supply all the things and services required for the wants of the constructors and manufacturers .
Thus the whole population of Canada by its work of different kinds , produce all those developments .
If we must obtain goods from abroad , we send other goods abroad in counterpart of them .
Now , what do you .
see ?
Everywhere the citizens are taxed to pay those schools , those hospitals , those bridges , roads and other public works .
The Canadians , as a collectivity , are thus compelled to pay what they produce as a collectivity .
You pay much more than the double price
And this is not all .
The population is made to pay more than the price of what it produced .
Their own production , - a real enrichment - has become for the Canadians a debt burdened with interest .
When years add to years , the sum of the interests can equal or even exceed the amount of the debt imposed by the system .
It happens that the population may have to pay two , three times the cost of what its members produced .
In addition to the public debts , there are industrial debts , also loaded with interests .
They compel the manufacturers and contractors to increase their prices beyond the cost of production , in order to reimburse the capital and the interests ; otherwise they would become insolvent , bankrupt .
Both public and industrial debts are paid , plus interest , by the Canadian population , to the financial system .
We pay taxes for the public debts , and a surplus of price for the industrial debts .
Prices are swelling while the purse is flattened by taxes .
A tyrannical system
These and many other facts are indicative of a money system , a financial system which controls instead of being a servant ; a system to dominate the people - as Oliver dominated the fellows of the Island before they rebelled .
And if the money masters refuse to lend , or if they make their conditions unbearable for the public bodies or for the manufacturers , what happens ?
It happens that the public bodies give up many projects , no matter how urgent ; and the manufacturers give up development or production plans that would answer to real needs of Canadians .
This is a cause of unemployment .
And those who still have something , or who earn a salary , must be taxed to prevent the unemployed from starving completely .
Can you imagine a more tyrannical system , with so baneful effects on every Canadian ?
A bar to distribution
And this is not all .
Not only the money system indebts the producers , or paralyzes the production it refuses to finance , but it is a wretched financial tool for the distribution of the goods .
Notwithstanding the fact that stores , shops and warehouses are full , and that everything is at hand for an even greater production , the distribution of the goods already produced is stinted .
You can obtain only what you can pay .
In face of an abundant production , there should be an abundance of purchasing power , of money in the wallets of the people .
Such is not the fact .
The price of the finished goods is always higher than the amount of money distributed as purchasing power in the course of their production .
This is inherent to the accountancy of the present system of finance which has no mechanism to fill the gap .
The capacity to pay is not made to equal the capacity to produce .
Finance and reality do not work at the same rate .
Reality means an abundance of goods easy to produce .
Finance means a lacking money hard to obtain .
To correct what is wicked Thus the present money system is truly an oppressive one , when it should be a system of service .
This does not mean that we must do away with it , but we must correct it .
The application of the financial principles known as Social Credit would make this correction magnificently .
( Do not confound Social Credit with the political party which usurps that name while pursuing other ends and practising an adverse policy . )
The principles of Social Credit , when applied , would make the money system a servant instead of a master .
They were discovered and enunciated by a genius , C. H. Douglas ( deceased in 1952 ) .
His first writings on this subject were published in 1918 .
Louis Even
2 : Social Credit Exact .
Logical .
Humane A commission under Pope Pius XI in 1939 found that Social Credit was not socialism in any way , but reflected the Church 's teaching on a just society .
The economic reform , called Social Credit , which was proposed in 1917 by Major C.H. Douglas , would perfectly assure a " wider and immediate redistribution of riches . "
We give here a little summary of Social Credit .
Social Credit would distribute the products to everyone .
At the same time , it would help the free enterprises .
It is the great protection against all dictatorship of finance and of the State against socialism and communism .
Social Credit considers realities .
It refuses to be hypnotized by the halo with which finance has been surrounded .
The economic realities are , on one hand , the production ; not only the existing production , but the production immediately possible , the production capacity ; and they are , on the other hand , the human needs .
Social Credit gives priority to the realities over the financial signs that are not realities , that must simply represent , and faithfully represent , the realities .
Real credit and financial credit
This is why Social Credit makes a distinction between real credit ( a reality ) and financial credit ( a representation ) .
The word " credit " comes from the Latin word " credere " and bears the idea of confidence .
Even in everyday language , to give credit to someone , is it not to indicate that we have confidence in him ?
Social Credit calls real credit of a country what really gives confidence in that country , confidence that one can live there without too much difficulty .
The real credit of a country is its production capacity .
It is its degree of possibility to produce and deliver the goods to the needs .
And Social Credit affirms that Financial credit must be the exact representation of the real credit .
It is therefore the production capacity that must determine the movement of finance .
It is absolutely not for finance to command , paralyze or limit the production capacity .
This is why Social Credit demands the establishment of an office of credit that would keep an account of national ( or provincial ) credit .
Any production , those of consumption goods and those of capital goods , would then be entered as an increase of wealth .
And all consumptions ( or destruction , or depreciation ) would then be entered as a decrease of wealth .
The net increase in wealth would be production minus consumption .
With very few and passing exceptions where a country would live at the expense of another , the production of a country surpasses its consumption .
The country is becoming richer .
It is therefore absurd to say that it is going into debt .
The public debt is an absurdity .
And when a country is getting richer , its citizens must certainly draw advantage of it .
This is what Social Credit recognizes , when speaking of a dividend to all , instead of debts and taxes on everyone .
Money without inflation
The present system is subject to inflation .
Inflation means rising prices .
When money cannot begin without , as today , creating a debt , it is necessary that ways be found to draw from the public more money than there was put into circulation , so as to refund the debt plus the interest of the debt .
Whence taxes , that are added to prices or that diminish the purchasing power before the prices .
Whence also increases of prices by industrials , who must draw from the public only the money to pay for the products , but also for the financial charges , the interests on the industrial loans .
Social Credit would suppress this cancer , this tumor upon the prices , since the production would be an increase of wealth , and not an indebtedness .
And , Social Credit would lower the prices to be paid by the buyers , since it would have the community pay only what it consumes , and not all what it produces .
If , as an example , in the whole country , the consumption was only equal to three quarters of the production , the buyers would only pay , on any article bought by them , only three quarters of the accounting price .
The Office of Credit would take care of compensating the retailer so that he may recuperate all of his accounting price .
This means that the amounts of money included in the prices , but not having reached the hands of the public , or directed towards saving or investment , are not applied to the purchase of the production , would be by the organism of credit replaced to the benefit of those who are in need of the products .
This would prevent the accumulation of products in the face of needs .
And the mechanism to do it would have the advantage of operating with a decrease in prices , therefore in eliminating all possible inflation .
A dividend to everyone
The periodic dividend to everyone , recommended by Social Credit , is also in conformity with the economic realities .
The modern production , in fact , is more and more the result of applied science , of inventions , of improvements in production techniques , and of all these things that constitute a common good : an heritage transmitted and increased from one generation to
the other .
The modern production is less and less the result of individual labour .
Hoping to distribute the production only through the reward of human labour , is therefore contrary to the facts .
It is at the same time impossible , for the money distributed as recompense for work can never buy the production that contains other elements in its prices .
Seeking salary increases with decreases in human labour , is also to change the meaning of the word salary .
It is no more a recompense for work ; it is the inclusion in the salary of the hired persons of what should be a dividend for all , since it is the fruit of progress and not of labour .
This deviation is a hindrance to the desired goal , since in becoming a salary instead of remaining a dividend , these additional amounts go into the prices .
Social Credit would distribute the dividend to everyone , directly , without charging it to industry .
It would truly raise everyone 's purchasing power .
Besides being the recognition of a very productive community capital , this social dividend would at the same time be an excellent way of satisfying to the primitive destination of the earthly goods .
" Earth and its riches were created for all men "
( Pie XII ) .
What is totally ignored by the present economic regime in its financial technique of distribution .
Social Credit would thus directly establish an adequate repartition of the goods of nature and of industry , instead of leaving the task to the surgery of taxation , that amputates and grafts continually , without ever healing the disease .
A share to each and everyone , guaranteed by the dividend to each and everyone from birth till death ; and this share should be sufficient to at least insure what is necessary for life .
Not a Political Party
The first idea that comes to the mind of too many people living in Canada , when they hear the words Social Credit , is the idea of a political party .
- Oh ! yes , they will say .
I know .
Social Credit , that small group from the West in a corner of the House of Commons .
Or that new name for a government , when people are tired of the old parties , as in Alberta , or this year in British Columbia .
I am not interested .
I am a Liberal ... or a Conservative ... or , maybe , a C.C. F.... or simply , I do n't bother about political parties ; they are all the same , taxing us and laughing at us when in power .
But no .
Social Credit is not a party , although there may be a party by that name .
Social Credit is no more a party than Christianity is a party , even if , in some countries you find political parties with such names as Christian Democrats , Christian Party , Christian Center , etc .
A political party exists purposely to seek power , to be or strive to be the group that rules the country .
Social Credit works in the very opposite way .
Social Credit will set the individual free ; it will place the individual in a situation where he can himself be the ruler of his own life .
Social Credit will thus distribute power to individuals not the power to boss their neighbours , but the power to order the goods they want from the potential production of their country .
Louis EVEN 3 : The present taxes are banditry
Debt service
In all the budgets of our public bodies , at the federal , provincial , municipal , school board , etc. , there is an item - and not the least - which is not at all allocated to pay a public service . "
It is the one that bears the name " Debt service " .
The debt is surely not a public service .
Rather the tribute to a public enslavement .
The money allocated each year to this purpose does not build nor maintain a single bridge , not even an inch square of pavement .
However , it is the most sacred point of the budget .
The least discussed , or rather not discussed at all .
Incompressible expense , they say .
Incompressible , but expandible because it is generally going to increase with the years .
All that has been built in the country , as for roads , bridges , schools , churches , public establishments , was done by the population of the country : some working at it directly , others producing what is needed in all sorts of things to satisfy the needs of those employed by the public sector .
Therefore , it is the fruit of the population 's collective work .
And yet , it is the population of the country who are thus taxed every year , to serve interests to some persons who , in no way , have put a hand to the work , who even often are perfect strangers .
In that , the taxation mechanism is a robbery mechanism .
Legalized robbery , but robbery just the same .
All the cities , all the towns , all the villages , have in their budgets this item that takes by force the money of the citizens without giving them anything in compensation .
The robbers do exactly like that .
With this difference that the robbers , those whom everybody call robbers , act without authorization .
They run some risks : they risk prison , penitentiary .
While the robbers to whom the citizens ' taxes go do not risk anything .
They do not even have to move from their place to get the hoard .
Our municipal councils , our school boards undertake to execute the robbery for them and to devoutly pass on the fruit to them .
The police , the authorities , the law come only on those who neglect or who refuse to thus give up their money .
The punished will be he who dares say " no " to the
agents of the robbers , to the tax collectors .
He will loose his house .
He is not quite told " Money or life ! " , but : " Your money , or the road for your family ! "
It goes the same with the provincial government .
The same with the federal government , or it is prison for he who does not want to bow before the requirements of the agents of this legalized robbery .
Public developments
Even when the money for the taxes and income taxes is really used to pay public services , why tax the individuals in order to pay the works , when the productive capacity of the country can at the same time provide public developments and products to be put on the market ?
If the people of the country can provide both , there is no reason to remove from them the right to private goods as conditions to allow them to have public goods .
Well , population is capable of providing both , when there are hundreds of thousand workmen who offer their services and of whom production has no need .
A great productive capacity therefore is not used .
Facing unused productive capacity , the taxes , that diminish the right of the individuals to products responding to their needs , are a robbery .
Social Security measures
There are also the taxes imposed in order to finance what is called Social Security : Family Allowances , Old Age Pensions , pensions for the invalids , allowances for the needy mothers , etc .
It is certainly just that , in some way , each person , employed or not , healthy or sick , has access to the necessary things of life .
But in a world where production abounds without even employing all the available workmen , why remove from some to allow others to have something ?
Why take from Peter 's plate to put in Paul 's empty plate when the pantry is overflowing ?
However , this is what is financially done , by the taxes , because the financial system is false : it rations in front of abundance .
To maintain it and to tax in front of abundance is to rob those who are taxed .
Therefore , here is another slice of modern taxes that makes up legalized robbery .
And there are others of it .
Governments outside of their role Today , governments are entering , more and more , into functions that are not particularly theirs .
It is not the role of a government to do what the persons , the families , the free groups , the intermediary bodies , the local administrations are capable of accomplishing as well , and even better , than the government .
If any hindrance stop the individuals , families , intermediary bodies to well accomplish their proper function , the government must intervene , not to do it in their place , but rather to remove the obstacle that the government alone can well remove .
It is the case of the purely financial obstacle .
The absence of means of payment in front of powerful physical means makes up a vice of finance .
If , instead of correcting this vice of the financial system , a correction that can only be well made by the government , the government taxes the citizens to take the place of the families or of the intermediary bodies , it commits many faults .
It neglects its proper role .
It allows financial monopoly to endure and to grow stronger .
It robs those whom it taxes .
It interferes with what is not of its jurisdiction .
The government thus become a robber at the same time as an invader .
It gives as an excuse the financial powerlessness of the inferior groups , when it should suppress the source of this powerlessness engendered by a disorderly financial system .
All the governments do the same .
The tax payers are sucked more and more .
It is not only their purchasing power that suffers a bit .
Their personal freedom is sponged on by the growing encroachments of the State and of its bureaucrats .
In the meetings between the Federal and Provincial governments , it is mostly a question of dividing up the sources of the fiscal policy .
That is to say , to decide what will be the part of the provinces in the money to draw from the tax payers .
Federal rights to tax and provincial rights to tax .
The rights of the citizens do not come into consideration .
It is however for them that the governments exist : to protect them and not to rob them .
When will there be a meeting of the taxers and the taxed to protect the rights of the second in limiting the powers of the first ?
Therefore , the legalized robbery that we denounce includes , at least :
What the government takes away from the population to pay tribute to a system that gets the population into debt in proportion as the population develops the country ;
What the government removes from the purchasing power of the individuals , when offered production waits for buyers ;
What the government takes in taxes to attend to functions that it must leave to persons , families , intermediary bodies ;
All what it deducts from the fruits of existing production , when potential production stays in nothingness owing to a vicious financial system that the government refuses to correct ;
All what this taxation system involves in heavy costs that would be useless under a system of sound finance , conforming to realities of modern productive capacity in the public sector at the same time as in the private sector .
The present mechanism of taxes and of income taxes , which keeps the governments so busy , is therefore a mechanism of legalized robbery .
The robber above all is the monopoly of money and credit .
The agents of the robber are the governments .
The victims are the tax payers , that is to say directly or indirectly , all the population .
Louis EVEN
WASHINGTON , Jan. 4 — Harriet E. Miers , the White House counsel who endured a brief moment in the spotlight as President Bush ’s Supreme Court nominee in 2005 , is leaving the administration , Mr. Bush ’s chief spokesman said today .
Ms. Miers ’s resignation will take effect Jan. 31 , and a search for a successor is under way , the White House spokesman , Tony Snow , said .
Mr. Snow said the resignation was not part of a big shift in the presidential staff .
“ She ’s been here six years , ” Mr. Snow said .
“ It ’s hard duty .
Yes , it really is . ”
Ms. Miers was known for her marathon work days in the service of President Bush .
Mr. Snow added , “ She is beloved not only because she is a really good human being , she ’s an extraordinarily wonderful human being , but also somebody who is a very careful and scrupulous lawyer , a ferocious defender of the Constitution , and somebody who was also deeply loyal to the president , and just somebody who is a delight to work with . ”
This image shows a DNA double helix ( green and purple strands ) being separated by a helicase enzyme ( green globule ) at the junction where the two strands fork .
To show that helicases actively separate the two strands of DNA , the researchers attached one end of a DNA strand to a microscope cover slip and attached the end of the other DNA strand to a micron - sized plastic bead .
The bead was then trapped in a tightly focused laser beam ( red ) , which allowed the researchers to measure the motion of the helicase as it unwound the DNA .

Cornell researchers have answered a fundamental question about how two strands of DNA , known as a double helix , separate to start a process called replication , in which genes copy themselves .
The research , published in the current issue of the journal Cell , examined the role of an enzyme called a helicase , which plays a major role in separating DNA strands so that replication of a single strand can occur .
Scientists have known that helicases bind to the area of a double helix where the two strands fork away from each other , like the free ends of two pieces of thread wound around each other .
The forked area opens and closes very rapidly .
But scientists have debated whether helicases actively separate the two strands at the fork or if they passively wait for the fork to widen on its own .
The research found that the helicase appears to actively exert a force onto the fork and separate the two strands .
" A simple passive unwinding mechanism does not explain our data , " said Michelle Wang , associate professor of physics and the paper 's senior author .
" Defects in helicases are associated with many human diseases , ranging from predisposition to cancer to premature aging , " said co-author Smita Patel , a biochemistry professor at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway , N.J. " Helicases are involved in practically all DNA and RNA metabolic processes . "
The researchers made their discovery by anchoring one end of one of the strands in a double helix to the surface of a microscope cover slip .
The end of the other strand was attached to a micron - sized plastic bead .
They then focused a laser beam on the tiny bead and trapped the bead in place within the beam of light .
This setup allowed the researchers to measure the position and force on the bead , creating a very precise sensor of the helicase motion .
As the helicase moved toward the fork and the double helix unwound , the tension on the two strands lessened .
Using statistical mechanics models , the researchers could then compare actual measurements of movement with predictions based on both active and passive scenarios .
" The unwinding has to have some active component to it , and based on our data , we can tell you exactly how active it is , " said Wang .
" Basically , it is an active unwinding motor . "
While helicases unwind very rapidly in cells , in test tube experiments the unwinding is much slower .
The researchers believe that helicases work with other enzymes , where " accessory proteins are helping the helicase out by destabilizing the fork junction , " said Wang .

The Young Economist 's Guide to Professional Etiquette
Daniel S. Hamermesh
Journal of Economic Perspectives , Volume 6 , Number 1 , Winter 1992 - Pages 169-179
Nearly all advanced graduate students and new assistant professors demonstrate astounding naiveté in their non-substantive professional dealings .
Graduate programs in economics offer courses that lead to written drafts of important research ; they teach little about how to refine those drafts and , more generally , about the personal interactions that cut and polish intellectual diamonds in the rough .
I provide here a short course aimed at removing that naiveté and helping young economists to avoid faux pas that might reduce their success in the profession .
If I Am Not For Myself , Who Is For Me ?
With tenure decisions usually made 5 1 / 2 years after you start your first full - time academic job , a leisurely revision of your thesis and slow submission for publication court disaster .
A major reason for denying tenure at most schools is lack of publications resulting from the researcher 's slow start .
Committee work , lecture preparation and advising students can quickly fill your schedule .
At least one manuscript from your thesis should be sent to a journal before you have finished your first year as an assistant professor .
Better still , have the entire thesis material submitted by that time , then move on to other research .
Unless you discipline yourself to produce research and to try to publish it , it simply will not happen .
Young economists are often extremely diffident about presenting their work .
Remember , though , good research is rarely done in solitary confinement ; and appearing inexperienced in public leaves you no worse off than obscurity and anonymity .
A presentation can improve your work , acquaint senior scholars with it , and raise your visibility with editors and potential employers .
Present your work at seminars , professional meetings and conferences .
These last in particular often welcome younger people , and can be broadly attended .
If you do so , make sure you get the paper to discussants at least 10 days before the meeting .
At least one well - known economist has killed off many relatives in excuses about tardy papers and has a wide reputation for irresponsibility .
Do not be embarrassed to send your work to more senior people ( but do not be forlorn if few or none respond ) .
A simple cover note stating that the recipient might be interested is sufficient .
Do not write a letter praising your work ; and never attempt to enhance the recipient 's interest by criticizing others .
I received a cover letter that asked , " Are 20 million Americans wrong , or are [ the authors ' antagonists ] wrong ? "
This appeal generated neither respect nor interest .
An advanced graduate student asked if he should mail his revised paper to a senior economist who had already provided comments .
Except for very close friends and colleagues , you cannot ask people to read multiple drafts .
His only " hook " was to send the revision as a courtesy , with thanks for the earlier comments but with no expectation of eliciting further aid .
The chief rule in presenting your research orally is to make sure that you convey the paper 's main contribution .
Too often , a junior lecturer will spend a large fraction of the allotted time reviewing the literature or engaging in needless algebraic pyrotechnics .
Stick to your point .
You have every right to tell a pesky interlocutor that you will handle a question after the presentation , provided you do so gently .
One - and - a- half hours are enough to demonstrate what you have done and why it is important , if you prevent others from wasting time and do not yourself dissipate the time with trivia .
When is a draft ready to send out for comments and presentation ?
Except for seminars at your own institution ( where the participants may be more friendly , or at least more forgiving ) , I recommend using the draft before the one you plan to submit for publication .
By this time the roughest edges are rounded off , yet it is still possible to improve the work greatly .
Waiting until the near - final version turns your interactions with other scholars into mere formalities .
How to respond to written and oral comments ?
Do n't respond to written comments that you think are foolish or correct , and do n't , as one student proposed , write a detailed refutation .
Other than offering thanks for the comments when you next see the person , no written response is necessary unless the point is partly correct and would benefit from further discussion .
For oral comments ( including those offered at seminars ) , immediate thanks are always in order , for both brilliant insights and complete nonsense .
Disputation may be beneficial , but only to advance understanding by both parties , not to score debating points .
The deepest expression of gratitude is explicit thanks in the acknowledgement footnote of the paper .
Thank people who offered major substantive comments that you incorporated , but avoid the usual callow exculpation of them .
If you have borrowed heavily and fairly generally from someone else 's work , be sure to include a statement to that effect in the footnote or elsewhere in the paper .
A journal editor asked one department chair about a young colleague whom a referee accused of wholesale plagiarism .
The young man had not plagiarized ; but the problem would have been avoided ( and the paper perhaps not summarily rejected ) if he had noted his intellectual debt .
Beyond these , the footnote should include only your title , affiliation , and thanks for any grants that supported the work .
An editor is unlikely to choose someone whom you have thanked to referee your paper .
Thus , some economists strategically fail to thank people , hoping for a friendly referee .
Others thank someone who has not seen the paper , as a talisman against that person being chosen .
DON'T PLAY THESE GAMES � the gains are not worth the potential costs of being caught .
You now revise your paper in light of the comments that you thought were useful .
Make sure the paper is not overly long , as no editor wants to publish even 50 typescript pages , and few referees wish to read that much .
Your writing style may not win you a Pulitzer Prize , but it should not be so horrendous that it masks your ideas .
( A good guide is McCloskey , 1987 . )
Check that the paper is not riddled with typing errors ; they may lead a referee to infer that the substance of your work is also careless .
Verify that all pages are included ; on several occasions I have received papers to referee that were missing pages .
Do not worry about the detailed style instructions that appear in many journals .
Those are for the final submission of an accepted paper .
Editors are not prejudiced against a legibly - typed submission that is not in the journal 's final format .
Even if the journal does not request one , it may make sense to enclose a short abstract of the paper .
Most professional communication is in refereed journals , all of which welcome unsolicited submissions .
In choosing among these , avoid underselling your work .
Start with a higher - quality outlet than your eventual target .
Better journals are more widely read , which increases attention to your subsequent efforts ( Siow , 1991 ) .
They use higher - quality referees ( Hamermesh , 1991 ) , so that you probably receive better comments .
Also , most of the 40 departments among the top 25 require publications in leading journals for granting tenure .
The professional returns to choosing a better journal are higher .
But a strategy of aiming high requires a thick skin ; the acceptance rate at major economics journals is around 10 percent .
Thus , it pays to have a " submission tree " in mind , a sequence of alternative outlets for your work .
Choose a journal that recently published works suggesting the editor might be interested in your work , that published a paper included in your references , or that a senior colleague tells you is appropriate .
Some journals specialize in theory , or in empirical work , or in subfields .
To acquaint different audiences with your work , avoid journals where you have published within the last year or where you have just had a paper accepted ( unless the editor explicitly invites submission ) .
Certainly do not , as a colleague did early in his career , submit a second paper upon receipt of the letter accepting the first .
He was kindly told by the editor to withdraw the second paper .
Unlike in some fields ( like legal scholarship ) , submitting the same paper to several economics journals is absolutely forbidden .
An editor wrote to me stating that a referee had handled my paper elsewhere and wondering if I had submitted it to two places .
I had not � it had been rejected at the other journal � but the implied threat in the letter showed the importance attached to this prohibition .
A cover letter for your submitted paper might be : " Please consider the enclosed manuscript , � Paper Title , ' for possible publication in the Review of Economic Nonsense .
I look forward to your response on this paper . "
If a submission fee is enclosed , mention it .
Nothing else is needed .
Do not summarize the paper , ballyhoo it , tell the editor why the journal is appropriate , or discuss your personal or professional problems .
Nearly all journals send an acknowledging postcard when your paper is received .
I have never failed to receive a postcard .
( I did , though , receive one from a journal to which I had not submitted a paper , but to whose editor I had sent the paper for comments . )
If you have not received the postcard within one month , you should call the editorial office .
The real wait is for an editorial response .
I have had responses within two weeks ( negative ) and as long as 13 months ( somewhat positive ) .
Colleagues report initial responses taking 24 months ( both negative and positive ) .
After four to six months , it is reasonable to call or write the editorial office .
In most cases the editor is aware of the problem , but is waiting for a dilatory referee .
Occasionally , though , the paper has slipped through the cracks .
One colleague waited two years , only to hear that a new editor had discovered his paper in a filing cabinet , and that the referee who had been assigned to it had died .
Having read the paper the previous evening , the new editor accepted it without changes .
An editor will not reject a paper solely because of an author 's reminder after four to six months of waiting .
( One even reprimanded an author for " letting your comment grow a beard " by waiting four months to inquire . )
I sent a birthday card to a journal editor ( whom I knew ) on the first anniversary of submission ( of a paper that was later accepted ) .
A long editorial lag can jeopardize the paper 's publication .
One junior colleague waited ten months to inquire about a paper 's status for fear of offending the editor .
The editor responded that he was having trouble deciding , but that he wanted the paper revised .
The resubmission several months later was immediately rejected by a new editor who was not interested in the topic .
One fine day you will receive an editor 's letter and the reports that the editor obtained from referees .
By far the most common is a Type I letter , outright rejection .
Most editors are careful to make clear they do not wish to see the paper again .
They include statements like , " . . . your paper does not contain a contribution sufficient enough to warrant publication . "
You should view the paper as finished with that journal .
Only if you believe the referee comments are completely misguided ( a frequent view of rejected authors ) and the editor indicates that he or she relied heavily on the referee should you think to ask the editor to reconsider your work .
Even then , think twice .
An editor 's mention of a specific reason for rejection does not invite resubmission ; the editor usually has several reasons .
Asking for reconsideration may make you look foolish ; you may wish to submit future work to the journal ; and there are more fish in the sea of journals .
A Type II letter , the next most common , suggests major changes with no strong hope of eventual publication .
Examples range from : " I would be willing to consider a major revision of the paper , but . . .
I can promise you nothing .
My judgment is that you have an uphill battle ; " to " The Journal of Economic Rubbish will not be able to publish your paper .
One of the responses is positive enough that I would not entirely rule out the possibility of resubmission . . . .
Another possibility would be to submit a revised version elsewhere ; " to " If you are willing to completely redo the paper to take account of the reviewers ' criticisms , we would be willing to take another look at it . "
Should you bother resubmitting the paper ?
Only the third letter is encouraging .
One young colleague firmly believed that a letter like it was an outright rejection and took substantial convincing before resubmitting her paper .
A good rule is that , unless the door has been slammed in your face , or you cannot in good conscience comply with the editorial suggestions , you should resubmit the paper .
The vagaries of the refereeing and editorial process make the likelihood of eventual acceptance far greater on a resubmission , even after a tepid response , than on any alternative second journal of equal quality .
Also , if you constructed a " submission tree , " your next alternative will be of lower quality .
Only on the first Type II letter should there have been any hesitation to resubmit .
The still less common Type III letter encourages resubmission but asks for substantial revisions , along the lines of : " Please prepare a revision . . . that deals with these issues .
I will check back with the referees before making a decision . "
A Type IV letter states that the journal is happy to publish your paper and asks for none , or only editorial changes .
This species is extremely rare .
Before sending the paper to a different journal in response to a Type I or very negative Type II letter , wait at least one week to digest the letters .
Then , if the editor or referees made comments that you think are useful , incorporate them .
In many cases a conscientious editor or helpful referee will indicate other potential outlets for the paper , perhaps better ones than you had in mind .
Send the paper off to the next journal , and wait again .
Remember that the editorial / refereeing process is sufficiently random that one rejection hardly provides definitive information about the quality of the paper .
Several colleagues report that after they had become discouraged by initial rejection , other authors published papers that an objective observer would agree were substantively identical to the rejected works .
If the paper is rejected by a second journal , what do you do with a two - time loser ?
Two rejections do not a bad paper indicate ; but three , and certainly four rejections suggest something is seriously wrong with the work .
At least rethink the paper completely .
You may also realize that your time is better spent on new projects .
Euthanasia � permanent commitment of the paper to the filing cabinet � is recommended for papers that are terminally ill ; and most experienced economists have buried papers after repeated rejections .
The problem diminishes with experience , not because one writes fewer bad papers , but because one gains increasing access to non-refereed outlets .
( Those outlets are often indistinguishable from the filing cabinet . )
Assume your work was good enough ( or you were fortunate enough ) , and you did not receive an outright rejection .
Take a few weeks to mull over the referee(s ' ) and editor 's comments .
Remember that waiting too long can result in your confronting a new , less sympathetic editor when you resubmit , or the same editor may reject your resubmission on the grounds that the result is now well - known .
One journal editor states that a resubmission will not be considered if the delay exceeds one year .
The resubmitted paper should include all major changes that the referees and editor suggested , unless you are convinced that they are mistaken .
In that case , a detailed explanation should accompany the resubmission ( on which more below ) .
For minor suggestions , appease the editor or referee if the change does not lower the quality of the paper .
This is what produces the accretion of footnotes as drafts progress toward publication .
If two referees make suggestions that conflict directly , you must sort out which ( if any ) is correct .
The resubmission letter should clarify what you did and why .
The editor may indicate that the paper can be shortened , and may be explicit about the desired length .
The ceiling should be strictly adhered to .
Playing games with longer paper , single spacing , narrower margins , and so on , is transparent to the editor .
Between initial submission and resubmission you may have had some brilliant new insights on the topic .
Is n't an invitation to resubmit also a chance to display the fruit of your additional labor ?
Do n't succumb to this temptation .
Minor changes can be included , with a justification in the resubmission letter .
But if the new work is sufficiently different or extensive , it merits another paper .
Editors and referees react adversely to attempts to lengthen a publication by sneaking in additional material .
The resubmission letter should summarize and justify all the major changes you have made .
Specific references to individual referees ' comments help the editor reach a decision .
One journal even suggests numbering each part of the referee reports and keying your letter to these numbers .
Other than a final sentence like , " I look forward to hearing from you on this revised paper , " nothing else is required .
The letter need not exceed two pages , though I have seen longer ones that essentially restate the paper .
Do not make gratuitous comments about the referees , both because such comments are never justified , and because the editor may send your letter to the same referees along with the revised manuscript .
On some Type II and III resubmissions none or not all the referees will be contacted ; in rare cases new referees will be sought on Type II resubmissions .
Your second wait will end when you receive another editorial letter and perhaps additional referees ' reports .
If the editor and referees were satisfied with your revision , the letter will accept the paper .
Most commonly it will request yet another resubmission .
Or the letter may be a rejection , giving you the choice between euthanasia for the paper and submission elsewhere .
The same etiquette applies on the second resubmission , and usually the changes suggested are more minor .
But what if the process seems nonconvergent ?
One editor invited a colleague to resubmit and enclosed two favorable referees ' reports .
The resubmission generated an unfavorable report from a third referee and another invitation to resubmit .
A second resubmission produced a glowing report from a fourth referee .
A third invited resubmission was rejected curtly with a negative report from a fifth referee !
In the very rare case where the paper does not seem to be converging to publication , you should ask whether they will eventually publish your piece .
If an explicit commitment is not received after the second resubmission , it may indicate the editor does not have the heart to deliver the coup de grace .
You may be better off submitting the paper elsewhere .
Your paper is " accepted " when the editor writes that it will be published in some agreed - upon form .
At that point or earlier the editor may suggest style changes and request that you rewrite your paper in accordance with the style of the journal .
( Instructions are usually enclosed with the letter . )
Always abide explicitly by the style requirements .
The ease of making these changes on word processors gives no excuse for shirking , and you have the chance to build up capital with the journal 's editorial staff .
The cover letter that transmits the final version to the journal should state that you have made the small changes requested .
You might also ask when the editor expects the article to appear , and when you will receive galley or page proofs .
Publication can be as quick as two months after final acceptance , or as long as two years ( Yohe , 1980 ) .
( The economics profession is regrettably slow in this area compared to the so - called hard sciences . )
After that , your next contact with the journal ( except with the few journals that ask you to check the copy - edited manuscript ) is to examine proofs .
All journals request an immediate turnaround on these ; failure to honor the request does not ( usually ) jeopardize publication , but it does type you as irresponsible .
READ THE GALLEYS CAREFULLY !
One press recommends , " Another person should read the manuscript aloud slowly while you read the proof .
If this is not possible , you should proofread by reading word for word from the manuscript to proof . "
One colleague had a reference to the New York Jets and ignored the error in the galleys that identified the New York Jests .
Be especially careful checking mathematics , and watch out for transposed numbers , rows or columns in tables .
Checking galleys is not the time to amend the article ; most journals threaten dire consequences for any changes , and some actually charge you for changes .
Also , do n't buy the reprints the journal offers .
They are an expensive throwback in an era of high quality photocopying .
Having checked the galleys and filled out whatever forms are required , send the package back immediately and look forward to seeing your paper in print some months later .
When the paper appears , make enough photocopies to supply people who gave you useful comments and others in the profession who might be interested in or benefit from seeing the published work .
If I Am for Myself Alone , What Am I ?
Even as a junior person , you will receive drafts of papers from colleagues and graduate school friends .
There is no obligation to comment on papers you receive , especially if you have nothing to say .
If you have nothing to say on any paper you receive , though , you might question whether you have sufficient interest to justify remaining in the profession .
Unless your comments are absolutely trivial , it is worth taking the time to write a letter , telephone or talk face - to - face with the author .
Major comments are received all too infrequently by most authors , but even minor ones are rare .
Unless you are convinced that your research will generate a deluge of helpful suggestions , aiding others is the only way to build up the capital that will prevent you from doing your own work in an intellectual vacuum .
No one has any obligation to pay attention to your research , not even your dissertation advisor , after you have headed out into the cold cruel world .
This activity should not detract from your own research .
Surely , though , there are times when your work is not progressing .
A " morning person " like me can set aside evenings for this type of professional service .
Pick times that fit your own diurnal or hebdomadal comparative advantage .
This sort of mutual intellectual aid society can be a lasting relationship .
One individual and I have been commenting on each other 's work for over 20 years , though we have never been classmates or colleagues .
Neither of us remembers who made the initial step ; but I at least continue to benefit immensely from his comments .
Attending seminars is another aspect of reciprocity .
You can not expect people to attend your presentations unless you attend theirs .
Seminars are good places to absorb research results , generate your own new ideas , and learn how to present your own work .
In addition , economists are a verbal lot ; the disputation in the best seminar situations has an almost Talmudic cast that sharpens the economic thinking of all participants .
Some economists have gained reputations for brilliance from their comments at seminars , and a concomitant professional recognition , that far exceeds the impact of their written work .
How talkative should a young economist be at seminars ?
Save corrections of minor algebraic or statistical errors for a private talk with the lecturer after the presentation .
Repeated silly interruptions will gain you the reputation of a fool ; wait a few seconds before opening your mouth .
One brilliant young colleague comments frequently but only occasionally sensibly at seminars ; however , his useful comments are among the best any lecturer could get .
The fraction of incorrect or idiotic remarks that is tolerated is directly proportional to the brilliance of the correct ones .
Refereeing is a more formal service to the research of others .
As you become known , you will receive an increasing stream of requests to referee .
( One editor explicitly states in acceptance letters that he will send you papers to referee and asks you to respond immediately if you do not wish to do so .
The implicit threat of revoking the acceptance creates a powerful disincentive to decline ! )
Most editors ask that you respond within one or two months , and a few journals provide a small monetary incentive for compliance .
Many editors request a referee 's report that will be sent to the author and a cover letter with your recommendation about publication .
No junior person should ever decline a request to referee because of pressing commitments , as none can claim to be swamped with other professional service .
At most schools this sort of service is expected , desired and even rewarded .
However , if the paper is far removed from your own work , send it back to the editor by return mail stating this fact .
Offer to referee a paper more in your area , lest the editor infer that you are shirking your professional responsibility .
If you have already refereed the manuscript for another journal , also return the request to the editor immediately .
Double jeopardy should not be part of refereeing , even if the paper has been amended in response to your comments .
If no one else is as capable as you of refereeing the piece , perhaps the editor should reject it as being of very limited interest .
Having decided to referee the paper , do it expeditiously .
A delay exceeding two months is unconscionable , though regrettably common .
Only the most brilliant young person should risk developing a reputation for slacking , and being responsible ingratiates you with editors and editorial staff .
It probably has no effect on whether they will publish your work , since editors strive to publish high - quality research regardless of the authors ' peccadilloes ; but it can affect their desire to push your paper through the refereeing process .
Refereeing the paper should hardly be all - consuming , nor should it be broad - brush .
The amount of time devoted to a paper depends on your interest in it and its difficulty .
If your report is not at least one tightly written page , though , you probably did not give the paper enough attention .
In writing your report ( to be seen by the author ) , lead off with a succinct summary of the paper , or move immediately to your major comments , criticisms and suggestions .
Then deal with specific , less important problems and arguments .
Do point out mathematical and econometric errors ; but unless the central result of the paper depends on such an error , finding one is not by itself cause for a negative view of the work .
If you recommend rejecting the paper , informing the author of a more appropriate outlet ( if you believe the paper is publishable somewhere ) is helpful .
The proper tone of the report is conveyed well by one editor 's admonition to referees :
" The reports should ... be no more abrasive than absolutely necessary .
Especially if the manuscript is to be declined , insert a kind remark if you can .
It will shine like a good deed in a naughty world . "
A major purpose of refereeing is to improve research .
Your constructive comments may be ignored if they are couched in a negative tone .
Never make your report part of a vendetta against another researcher .
The temptation is often great , as you will be asked to referee papers by scholars who have criticized your own work , who have sharply conflicting views , or who have been patently nasty to you .
Resist temptation .
Do not make gratuitous comments about the author 's morality .
In one case , such comments led to legal action by the author against the referee .
Never go beyond the refereeing process , as numbers of economists have done , by writing an unsolicited letter to an editor seeking to stifle publication of an article .
Your letter to the editor should mention briefly ( not repeat ) the major problems , strengths and contributions of the paper .
It should also assess whether even a greatly revised version of the paper merits publication in that particular journal .
A large fraction of rejections should result partly from cover letters that state something like : " Though there is nothing wrong with the paper , the original point is fairly minor and of insufficiently general interest to appear in a major journal . "
Keep this in mind when you receive a Type I letter despite what appear to be moderately favorable referees ' reports .
Frankness is crucial in the cover letter , as the editor may lack the expertise to place the paper in the context of other research .
If you recommend rejection , make it as clear as the colleague who wrote , " Let me state plainly that this is a very bad paper . "
Do not , though , base your recommendation on strategic considerations involving your own research , such as speculation that publication of the paper might diminish interest in your work .
In many cases , you will receive a resubmitted manuscript for further refereeing .
Unless the author added new material or made a truly fundamental mistake that you failed to catch in the original , your comments and criticisms should be limited to follow - ups .
Otherwise , you are encouraging a nonconvergent refereeing process and being unfair to the author .
A Few General Rules
First , do not be hostile .
People pay attention to correct and interesting ideas they read or hear .
Hostility only reduces the attention your ideas receive by concentrating listeners on your style instead of your substance .
Second , be forthcoming and speak up ; be assertive without being pushy .
Each year roughly 800 new Ph.D.s in economics are minted .
Unless you advertise your ideas , your work will be ignored .
Finally , and most important , the Golden Rule ( biblical , not growth - theoretic ) is a good guide for professional etiquette for young economists .
Graduate students and many necessarily anonymous faculty at my own and other schools provided helpful suggestions and a wealth of anecdotes .
I am especially indebted to Thomas Klier and Michael McPherson .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Hackers stole information from the U.S. Department of Transportation and several U.S. companies by seducing employees with fake job - listings on advertisements and e-mail , a computer security firm said .

Hackers stole information from the U.S. Department of Transportation and several U.S. corporations by seducing employees with fake job - listings on ads and e-mail , a computer security firm said on Monday .
REUTERS / Handout
The victims include consulting firm Booz Allen , computer services company Unisys Corp , computer maker Hewlett - Packard Co and satellite network provider Hughes Network Systems , a unit of Hughes Communications Inc , said Mel Morris , chief executive of British Internet security provider Prevx Ltd .
Of the list , only Unisys acknowledged that viruses had been detected and removed from two PCs , saying no information had been leaked .
A Department of Transportation spokeswoman said the agency could not find any indication of a breach and a spokeswoman for Hughes said she was unaware of any breaches .
The other parties either declined comment or did not respond to requests for comment .
Prevx said the malware it identified uses a program named NTOS .
exe that probes PCs for confidential data , then sends it to a Web site hosted on Yahoo Inc .
That site ’s owner is likely unaware it is being used by hackers , Morris said .
He believes the hackers have set up several “ sister ” Web sites that are collecting similar data from other squadrons of malware .
It was not clear whether the hackers used any information stolen from more than 1,000 PCs .
The hackers only targeted a limited group of computers , which kept traffic down and allowed them to stay under the radar of security police , who tend to identify threats when activity reaches a certain level .
“ What is most worrying is that this particular sample of malware was n’t recognized by existing antivirus software .
It was able to slip through enterprise defenses , ” said Yankee Group security analyst Andrew Jaquith , who learned of the breach from Morris .
Security experts say such crimes occur frequently because hackers have access to software that allows them to build undetectable malware that security firms are unable to fight .
In this case , the malware had not been flagged as dangerous , although security firms put out updates identifying it as such on Monday night after Prevx sounded the alarm .
“ The sophistication is really far out there .
There is no way security companies are going to catch up , ” said Rick Wesson , chief executive of Support Intelligence , a San Francisco firm that helps companies and government agencies detect and fight attacks on their computer systems .
Wesson said his company is monitoring three other campaigns that are currently ongoing , but declined to discuss them , saying that could hamper counter - intelligence efforts .
WAKE -UP CALL
Many large organizations -- including government agencies -- do not use all the bells and whistles in their security software , security experts say .
For example , organizations can choose to only let employees run programs on a list of safe software , but most take the opposite approach , banning programs listed as dangerous .
Also , sensitive information on PCs is rarely encrypted .
Doing so makes stolen information useless to hackers , but requires extra work by employees who access the data .
A researcher with a large security firm said the attack disclosed by Prevx is “ a wake - up call . ”
“ We try to strike a balance between usability and protection .
It ’s a delicate balance .
But organizations need to lean more toward the protection side than the usability side , ” said the researcher who declined to be identified .
What is unusual about the case publicized by Prevx , security experts say , is that the firm named the victims .
Prevx CEO
Morris said he did so to bring attention to vulnerabilities in security systems protecting sensitive government data .
Hackers use security tools to help them determine whether their malware will be able to get past corporate and government defenses .
For example , a Web site called virustotal .com lets users upload files to see if they are safe .
Hackers use it to see if their malware will make it past security systems .
Morris said he had downloaded the data from the Web site used by the hackers and provided it to investigators from the FBI ’s Law Enforcement Online , or LEO , program .
An FBI spokesman declined comment .

1 “ Hygiene ” comes from Hygieia , the Greek goddess of health , cleanliness , and . . . the moon .
Ancient Greek gods apparently worked double shifts .
2 The human body is home to some 1,000 species of bacteria .
There are more germs on your body than people in the United States .
3 Not tonight dear , I just washed my hands : Antibacterial soap is no more effective at preventing infection than regular soap , and triclosan ( the active ingredient ) can mess with your sex hormones .
4 Save the germs !
A study of over 11,000 children determined that an overly hygienic environment increases the risk of eczema and asthma .
5 Monks of the Jain Dharma ( a minority religion in India ) are forbidden to bathe any part of their bodies besides the hands and feet , believing the act of bathing might jeopardize the lives of millions of microorganisms .
6 It ’s a good thing they ’re monks .
7 Soap gets its name from the mythological Mount Sapo .
Fat and wood ash from animal sacrifices there washed into the Tiber River , creating a rudimentary cleaning agent that aided women doing their washing .
8 Ancient Egyptians and Aztecs rubbed urine on their skin to treat cuts and burns .
Urea , a key chemical in urine , is known to kill fungi and bacteria .
9 In a small victory for cleanliness , England ’s medieval King Henry IV required his knights to bathe at least once in their lives — during their ritual knighthood ceremonies .
10 That ’s their excuse , anyway : Excrement dumped out of windows into the streets in 18th - century London contaminated the city ’s water supply and forced locals to drink gin instead .
11 A seventh grader in Florida recently won her school science fair by proving there are more bacteria in ice machines at fast - food restaurants than in toilet bowl water .
12 There ’s no “ five - second rule ” when it comes to dropping food on the ground .
Bacteria need no time at all to contaminate food .
13 The first true toothbrush , consisting of Siberian pig hair bristles wired into carved cattle - bone handles , was invented in China in 1498 .
But tooth brushing did n’t become routine in the United States until it was enforced on soldiers during World War II .
14 Please do n’t squeeze the corncob .
In 1935 , Northern Tissue proudly introduced “ splinter - free ” toilet paper .
Previous options included tundra moss for Eskimos , a sponge with salt water for Romans , and — hopefully splinter - free — corncobs in the American West .
15 NASA recently spent $ 23.4 million designing a toilet for the Space Shuttle that would defy zero gravity with suction technology at 850 liters of airflow per minute .
That ’s a lot of money for a toilet that sucks .
16 In 1843 , Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. campaigned for basic sanitation in hospitals .
But this clashed with social ideas of the time and met with widespread disdain .
Charles Meigs , a prominent American obstetrician , retorted , “ Doctors are gentlemen , and gentlemen ’s hands are clean . ”
17 Up to a quarter of all women giving birth in European and American hospitals in the 17th through 19th centuries died of puerperal fever , an infection spread by unhygienic nurses and doctors .
18 TV kills !
University of Arizona researchers determined that television remotes are the worst carriers of bacteria in hospital rooms , worse even than toilet handles .
Remotes spread antibiotic - resistant Staphylococcus , which contributes to the 90,000 annual deaths from infection acquired in hospitals .
19 It is now believed President James Garfield died not from the bullet fired by Charles Guiteau but because the medical team treated the president with manure - stained hands , causing a severe infection that killed him three months later .
20 What on earth made them think manure - stained hands were remotely acceptable to treat anyone ?
These are the notes for a talk that I ’m giving tomorrow at Makerere University in Kampala , Uganda .
I ’m posting them here because it is a convenient way to write and others might find these interesting .
I ’ll talk about MIT because that is where I have the most experience teaching .
MIT operates the same way that it did upon opening in 1865 : two semesters with long vacations in between ; students do most of their learning in take - home problem sets ( 6 - 9 hours / week / course ) for which they get some inspiration in lectures ( 2 - 3 hours / week ) ; evaluation / grading is done by the same people who are teaching / coaching .
The calendar was designed for rich families .
You want your kid available in the winter so that you can take him down to your estate in Florida .
You want him free to accompany you on a Grand Tour of Europe during the summer .
In 2007 , however , most college students are from middle - class families .
Why would you want to pay for the kid to attend four years of college , plus spring break trips to Mexico and summer vacations , when a bachelor ’s degree could be obtained in 2.5 years on a normal 48 - week / year work schedule ?
How about lectures ?
You need to broadcast some information to 100 people .
Printing was expensive and cumbersome in 1865 .
Telephone , television , and Internet did not exist .
A lecture was probably indeed the most efficient way of getting some information to a large group , despite the fact that humans can read 3X faster than they can listen ..
Compare to 2007 , however , when you could simply email a list of those 100 people or provide them with a URL .
Why did people come to lectures in 1865 ?
Their lodgings were n’t centrally heated and the temperatures in Boston can get down to - 10C .
Many came to get warm .
They had no television , no radio , no Internet , no email , no instant messaging , no mobile phone .
Many students came to lecture for entertainment .
What about homework ?
Students would do homework either in the library or at home .
In 1865 both places lacked television , video games , email , etc .
In 2007 , the students who do best may be the ones with the best study habits , not those who are the most able .
Companies do not rely on lecture + homework for getting work done ; they create an environment with limited distractions and keep workers there for most of each day .
Evaluation and grading in 1865 was done by the teachers .
This is an invitation to dishonesty since you are always tempted to give students
As , but there was little alternative since student work was not easily accessible to others .
In 2007 in most areas of academia , student work can be viewed just as easily by someone on the other side of the planet as by the teacher .
If we want to ensure quality and that students always regard us teachers as allies , why would we want to be involved in evaluation ?
How well does the MIT system work ?
It should work pretty well .
We have some of the best and most energetic lecturers in the U.S. Lectures are generally kept to 50 minutes ( more than double the limit established by education researchers ) .
The lectures are demanding ; if you tune out for 5 minutes , you will have a lot of trouble catching up .
Professors do not put up PowerPoints and read them bullet by bullet .
Homework assignments are weekly in most courses and are extremely demanding .
The students are among the most able and best - prepared in the U.S.
Yet when you ask graduates in CS what percentage of their classmates are capable of programming and what percentage they would enjoy working with , the answer is usually 25 - 30 percent .
People who studied poetry , physics , or civil engineering are often better software engineers than an MIT CS graduate ( contrast with medicine ; not too many good doctors out there who skipped med school ) .
A MIT student graduates ready to work for an engineer , not to be an engineer .
Not too impressive considering the near - $ 200,000 cost and the abilities of the incoming students .
( And the problem is not always fixed on the first job ; companies tend to give junior engineers a tiny piece of a big problem , not a small problem to solve by themselves ) .
6.171 : Software Engineering for Internet Applications .
This is a one - semester attempt to address the deficiencies in the rest of the curriculum .
What do we try to teach in 13 weeks ?
object - oriented design where each object is a Web service ( distributed computing )
about concurrency and transactions
how to build a stateful user experience on top of stateless protocols
about the relational database management system ( there is no DBMS course at MIT )
how to work at every stage of the engineering life cycle : listen to a vague request , write down a precise spec , build a prototype , document for other programmers , test with users , refine , launch , refine , document for decision - makers
How does it work ?
Students organized themselves into teams of 2 ( ideal ) or 3 ( acceptable ) and are connected with a real - world client .
Lecture time is devoted to teams presenting either designs or prototypes and the other teams criticizing .
This prepares students to participate in engineering design reviews .
If nobody makes a suggestion I consider important , I will make it myself at the end of a review or via email to the class mailing list after class .
If I have something that I want everyone to know , I add it to the online textbook or email it to the class prior to meeting .
Occasionally we will use the meeting time for teams to work together ( sometimes paired with another team ) on a data modeling challenge .
This works great in rooms with a lot of blackboards and after 20 minutes we start asking teams to present their work while others criticize and comment .
Most evaluation is done by the clients ( usually non-technical ) , professional interface designers whom I bring in , and professional software engineers whom I bring in as mentors and critics .
The final presentation and write - up is evaluated by a team of business executives and venture capitalists ; students are told to pitch the project as though they were seeking follow - on funding .
How well does it work ?
Students report that this was the most useful class at MIT
Most graduates of the course ended up getting the jobs that they wanted , usually at Microsoft or Google ( though the ones who went to Microsoft subsequently quit to work for Google )

Conclusion :
Lecturing has been found to be extremely ineffective by all researchers .
The FAA limits lectures to 20 minutes or so in U.S. flight schools .
Lab and project work are where students learn the most .
The school that adopted lab / projects as the core of their approach quickly zoomed to the first position among American undergrad schools of engineering ( www.olin.edu).
Engineers learn by doing progressively larger projects , not by doing what they ’re told in one - week homework assignments or doing small pieces of a big project
Everything that is part of a bachelor ’s in CS can be taught as part of a project that has all phases of the engineering cycle , e.g. , teach physics and calculus by assigning students to build a flight simulator
It makes a lot of sense to separate teaching / coaching from grading and , in the Internet age , it is trivial to do so .
Define the standard , but let others decide whether or not your students have met the standard .
A student who graduates with a portfolio of 10 systems , each of which he or she understands completely and can show off the documentation as well as the function ( on the Web or on the student ’s laptop ) , is a student who will get a software development job .

David Gergen responds to Bush 's speech on his rewriting of conflicts that we 've fought in and clearly understands our history a little , much , incredibly , " fill in the blank " --- better than the President .
We do keep records of past events .
I figured I 'd give him a heads up .
And let 's again ask President Bush why he did n't serve in Vietnam along with our co-President Cheney ?
Maybe they could have helped .
Then again they smeared Kerry for actually fighting .
Download Download
GERGEN : Well , he may well have stirred a hornet 's nest among historians , because there are so many differences between this struggle and what we faced in past , and I think by just invoking Vietnam , something he has tried not to do .
He 's tried all along to say this is not Vietnam .
By invoking Vietnam he raised the automatic question , well , if you 've learned so much from history , Mr. President , how did you ever get us involved in another quagmire ?
Why did n't you learn up front about the perils of Vietnam and what we faced there ?
And Vietnam and Korea , of course , were not victories for America .
Korea ended in a draw and Vietnam ended in a loss .
So it 's surprising to me he would go back to that to make -- and I think he 's going to get a lot of criticism , or a lot of critiques , that will disagree with him and point out differences
Thanks to CNN for the transcript :
COLLINS : We have heard Iraq compared to Vietnam before .
But just a few minutes ago it was President Bush making the comparison this time .
He invoked Vietnam to argue against pulling out of Iraq .
David Gergen served as counselor to four presidents .
He 's joining us this morning from Cambridge , Massachusetts .
David , it 's nice to see you again .
DAVID GERGEN , FMR .
ADVISER TO 4 PRESIDENTS : Thank you .
COLLINS : If you were able to listen into the president , it was kind of an interesting speech , a history lesson , different conflicts that this country has been involved in .
What 's your take on his comparison of the Iraq War to Vietnam ?
GERGEN : Well , he may well have stirred a hornet 's nest among historians , because there are so many differences between this struggle and what we faced in past , and I think by just invoking Vietnam , something he has tried not to do .
He 's tried all along to say this is not Vietnam .
By invoking Vietnam he raised the automatic question , well , if you 've learned so much from history , Mr. President , how did you ever get us involved in another quagmire ?
Why did n't you learn up front about the perils of Vietnam and what we faced there ?
And Vietnam and Korea , of course , were not victories for America .
Korea ended in a draw and Vietnam ended in a loss .
So it 's surprising to me he would go back to that to make -- and I think he 's going to get a lot of criticism , or a lot of critiques , that will disagree with him and point out differences .
But I think the larger point of the speech was that this president is continuing to hang very tough .
This is not a man who 's talking about compromises .
This is not a man who 's talking about a plan B .
This is not a man who is talking about , you know , let 's reconfigure our forces in Iraq the way our Iraq Study Group did .
This is a man saying , I 'm hanging tough , and , by the way , what you may have heard yesterday from Maliki is not my true position ; I 'm still with him .
Despite not only what Democrats are saying , but despite what his own ambassador has said in the last 48 hours , Mr. Crocker , who has really distanced the United States from Maliki .
COLLINS : All right , well , certainly all of this coming out in light of the report that will be expected from General Petraeus and from Ambassador Crocker coming up in September , so no question there as to why we are seeing some of these speeches .
I 'm sure that there will be another one or two before that September report .
Buy quickly , David , I want to get back to the Vietnam issue , because I think it 's something that will be talked about further today , if not tomorrow , as well .
GERGEN : Sure .
COLLINS : He did say exactly this -- we listened carefully -- he said the real problem was America 's presence , and that if we would just withdraw then the killing would end .
Three decades later , though , there is one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam , and that is the price of America 's withdrawal paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms , like boat people , re-education camps and killing fields .
Is he not making a comparison not about why we got into the war , but about whether or not the United States should withdraw ?
GERGEN : Yes , he is .
And there are a couple of issues there .
He 's right , that initially when we pulled back in Vietnam there were massive killings .
I think he 's wrong to say that Cambodia only occurred because we pulled back .
There are many who believed had we not have gone into Cambodia ourselves , this country might have been more stable .
But there are a couple of things about it .
Everybody , including General Petraeus under his plan to let the surge diminish here in the spring , and the Iraq Study Group is to pull back off the streets , I think everybody understands that when we start doing that there are going to be a lot of killings in Iraq , too .
We 're not going to stay there forever to prevent killings .
When we start pulling back there is likely to be a bloodbath in Iraq , too .
But here 's the other point , that if you look at Vietnam today , you have to say that Vietnam at the end , after 30 years , has actually become quite a driving country .
It 's a very strong economy .
So there are those who say , yes , when we pull back there were bloodbaths in the immediate aftermath , but after that the Vietnamese started putting their country together .
Is that not what we want Iraq to do over the long term ?
COLLINS : Yes ,
In fact , the president said the Iraq war will show an advance of freedom , just like that in Japan and Korea , if we 're looking at the other Asian countries .
Do you agree with that ?
GERGEN : Well , I think that 's right .
But the other issue and why it 's dangerous territory for him to go into Vietnam and the Vietnam analogy is reason we lost Vietnam in part was because we had no strategy .
And the problem we 've got now in Iraq , what is the strategy for victory ?
If the strategy for victory is let our troops give the Maliki government enough time to get everything solved , and the Maliki government is going nowhere , as everybody now admits , you know , what strategy are we facing ?
What strategy do we have to win in Iraq ?
It 's not clear we have a winning strategy in Iraq .
And that 's what cost us Vietnam , and that 's why we eventually withdrew under humiliating circumstances .
I do think that what the Democrats are coming around to and what many Republicans will support is some sort of gradual pullback from the cities in Iraq , but keep a significant American presence in Iraq .
Not to pull a full withdrawal .
And the question becomes for the president , he talks black and white -- victory or withdrawal , Those are the two options .
And Democrats and Republicans are saying , Mr. President , there is a third option here , and that is a partial pullback .
Stay there , try to prevent a civil war , try to prevent al Qaeda from gaining too much ground .
Is he willing to recognize that as a third option ?
Is he willing to bargain ?
today there was no indication that he as willing to do that .
COLLINS : The age - old point , I think , is even clear today .
Every conflict is so vastly different , and every enemy different , too .
David Gergen , nice to talk to you .
GERGEN : Thank you so much .
Take care .
LEGISLATORS in cities across the United States , alarmed at the spread of " McMansions " , are trying to contain the size of American houses .
Inspired by concerns that communities are disappearing and alarmed by the environmental costs , planners have drawn up measures to ensure new homes stay within a footprint that is proportionate to the plot size .
Since 1973 the median size of a new home in the US has grown from 142 square metres to 208 square metres .
At the same time , the number of people per household has fallen from 3.1 to 2.6 .
France ’s legally mandated 35 - hour work week gives workers a lot of leisure time but not necessarily the means to enjoy it .
Taxes on high - wage earners are so burdensome that hordes have fled abroad .
( Mr. Sarkozy cites the case of one of his stepdaughters , who works in an investment - banking firm in London . )
In her National Assembly speech , Ms. Lagarde said that there should be no shame in personal wealth and that the country needed tax breaks to lure the rich back .
“ All these French bankers ” working in London and “ all these fiscal exiles ” taking refuge from French taxes in Belgium “ want one thing : to come back to France , ” she said .
“ To them , as well as to all our compatriots who are looking for the keys to fiscal paradise , we open our doors . ”
Indeed , the idea of admitting one ’s wealth , once considered déclassé , is becoming more acceptable .
A cover story in the popular weekly magazine VSD this month included revelations that just a few years ago would have been unthinkable : the 2006 income of leading French personalities ( $ 18 million for soccer star Zinedine Zidane , $ 12.1 million for rock star Johnny Hallyday , $ 334,000 for Prime Minister François Fillon , $ 109,000 for Mr. Sarkozy ) .
“ We are seeing an important cultural change , ” said Eric Chaney , chief economist for Europe for Morgan Stanley .
“ Working families in France want to be richer .
Wealth is no longer a taboo .
There ’s a strong sentiment in France that people think prices are too high and need more money .
It ’s not a question of thinking or not thinking . ”
Still , the French seem to be divided about the best way to get rich .
On Thursday , a widely reported TNS - Sofres poll of more than 1,000 people concluded that 39 percent of the French think that it is possible to get rich by winning the lottery ; only 40 percent believe that getting rich can happen through work .
Certainly , the veneration of money more than ideas is new to French politics .
Other French presidents flaunted their intellectual sides .
Georges Pompidou was a teacher and author of a widely read anthology of poetry still used in French schools .
François Mitterrand was a literature buff who collected rare books .
' Terrorism " has two faces .
There are real threats and real terrorists , and then again there is a realm of nameless fears , vague forebodings and irrational responses .
The German federal police seem to have succumbed to the latter : on July 31 they raided the flats and workplaces of Dr Andrej Holm and Dr Matthias B , as well as of two other people , all of them engaged in that most suspicious pursuit - committing sociology .
Dr Holm was arrested and flown to the German federal court in Karlsruhe ; he has since been put in ( pre-trial ) solitary confinement in a Berlin jail .
Of course the police may have solid , rational knowledge they are withholding , but their public statements belong to the realm of farce .
Dr B is alleged to have used , in his academic publications , " phrases and key words " also used by a militant group , among them " inequality " and " gentrification " .
The police found it suspicious that meetings occurred with German activists in which the sociologists did not bring their mobile phones ; the police deemed this a sign of " conspiratorial behaviour " .
Thirty years ago Germany had a terrible time with indisputably violent militant groups , and that leaden memory hangs over the police .
And it may well be that " gentrification " is a truly terrifying word .
But this police action in a liberal democracy seems to fall more into Guantánamo mode than genuine counter - espionage .
Consider the hapless
Dr B a little further .
He 's not actually accused of writing anything inflammatory , but seen rather to be intellectually capable of " authoring the sophisticated texts " a militant group might require ; further , our scholar , " as employee in a research institute has access to libraries which he can use inconspicuously in order to do the research necessary to the drafting of texts " of militant groups , though he has n't writtten any .
The one solid fact the cops have on Dr Holm is that he was at the scene of the " resistance mounted by the extreme leftwing scene against the World Economic Summit of 2007 in Heiligendamm " , perhaps mistakenly believing he is studying this scene rather than stage - managing it .
These are not reasons for Brits , any more than Americans , to cluck in righteous disapproval ; in the long , sad history of the IRA , reality and fantasy entwined in an ever tighter cord .
But , apart from hoping that our colleague Dr Holm will be freed if only he promises to carry his mobile phone at all times , we are struck by the grey zones of fragile civil liberties and confused state power that this case reveals .
The liberal state is changing .
In the 60s , Germany had the most enlightened rules for refugees and asylum seekers in Europe ; the US passed the most sensible laws on immigration in its history ;
France granted automatic citizenship to all those born on its territory , including all Muslims .
Today all these countries have , in the name of the war on terror , revised their rules - the state of emergency prevails .
The laws meant for real threats are invoked to counter shapeless fear ; in place of real police work , the authorities want to put a name - any name - to what they should dread .
States of emergency are dangerous to the legitimacy of states .
In cases conducted like this one , a government stands to lose its authority and so its ability to root out actual terrorists .
If our colleagues are indeed dangerous sociologists , they should be prosecuted rationally .
But , as in Guantánamo , persecution seems to have taken the place of prosecution .

Meet the Chork , a fork - chopstick hybrid food gadget , like the spork , or the Futter .
This is perfect for those times when you want to use chopsticks but do n’t really know how , but still want the luxury of wood pressing against your lips as you shovel food into your mouth .
That was always my problem with chopsticks .

The underworked American Stop your whining : leisure time is on the rise IF YOU'RE WORKING next week -- a time designed by nature for fleeing office parks and sweltering , odoriferous cities -- you could be forgiven for feeling a touch of self - pity : poor , overworked American .
Read about labor trends and you 'd feel even more beleaguered .
In May , a report titled " No - Vacation Nation , " from a Washington , D.C. , think tank , rubbed our noses in the fact that we get comically brief vacations compared with Europeans .
Then there was the recent Harvard Business Review article decrying the rise of the " extreme job " :
More and more high achievers are forced to choose between a 70 - hour workweek or lifetime " Team B " career status .
Working beneath the radar , however , some sociologists and economists have been gathering provocative data that suggest that Americans are not nearly as workaholic as we think we are .
True , we do n't evacuate our cities in August , like the French .
But today , these scholars say , we spend far less time on work than Americans did four decades ago .
From 1965 to 2003 , according to one study published this month , the average American gained the equivalent of seven weeks of vacation -- in the form of extra leisure time spread throughout the year .
Much of the time - savings comes from a source few people think about when they whine ( or brag ) about their workweeks : cleaning and cooking .
We do much less of it than we used to , thanks to vacuum cleaners , takeout food , and other innovations .
And the time - savings there more than offsets the extra time women now spend in offices , according to the study , which appears in the latest issue of The Quarterly Journal of Economics .
" The amount of stuff that my wife and I do around the house , compared to what my mom and father did around the house , is lower by an order of magnitude of 30 or 40 percent than what they did , " says Erik Hurst , an economist at the University of Chicago who coauthored the study .
His parents did n't have a dishwasher .
" We have takeout food twice a week from a variety of healthy opportunities ; they did n't . "
The new study is part of a quiet revolution offering an arguably more accurate , and certainly surprising , portrait of how we spend our time .
Hurst , along with coauthor Mark Aguiar , a University of Rochester economist , is among a growing number of scholars who champion the use of so - called time - diary surveys , which ask people to recount in detail how they spent a specific recent day .
The technique has been used for decades but is gaining in popularity as economists realize the importance of pinning down the time spent on small , forgettable tasks ( like mopping a floor ) .
And it discourages exaggeration , its advocates say , because the time estimates for a given day can't add up to more than 24 hours .
That 's important , because when it comes to working hours in our macho office culture , " the greater the estimate , the greater the overestimate , " says John P. Robinson , a sociologist at the University of Maryland who draws on time - diary data in his own work .
" People who estimate 70 hours are more likely to put in 55 . "
That highballing contributes to the sense that we are all overworked .
In their analysis , Aguiar and Hurst break the day into numerous subcategories : " core market work " ( time at your desk , or tightening rivets ) , " total market work " ( add the commute ) , " core nonmarket work " ( housework ) , " obtaining goods and services , " and childcare .
And they offer four alternative definitions of leisure -- a slippery concept , to be sure .
The one that may best match the common - sense view includes playing sports , watching TV , pet care , hobbies , sleeping , and eating .
( This definition treats childcare as 100 percent work , though , ignoring the fun parts . )
For men , much of the gain in free time comes from a decrease in on - the - job hours .
Their core market work has dropped from 42 to 36 hours weekly , the economists say .
Men do about four more hours of housework and shopping a week than they did in 1965 .
On balance , their leisure time , using the above definition , is up 6.2 hours a week .
The average " core " time women spend on the job has climbed a bit , from 19 to 23 hours , but their total nonmarket work has plummeted -- from 33 to 23 hours .
( The data in the study are corrected for demographic shifts . )
Leisure has expanded even though both men and women spend about two hours more each week on childcare than in 1965 .
Overall , women 's free time is up by five hours a week , the study finds .
A depressing finding is what we do with our alleged extra time : mostly , watch TV .
Hobbies are flat while reading and socializing are both down .
And there is also a striking socioeconomic split in the allocation of free time , according to the new study : Men and women with college degrees have seen no change in leisure time , but the lower you go on the educational scale , the more your free time has grown .
This finding raises a red flag for skeptics of the study -- of whom there are many .
John Schmitt , an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research , in D.C. , and coauthor of the " No - Vacation Nation " report , points out that Aguiar and Hurst 's account -- though an admirable technical accomplishment -- makes the mistake of lumping together voluntary and involuntary leisure .
In their study , an executive 's round of golf equals a downsized call - center operator 's lounging around the house , depressed because he can't get a job .
This touches on a central concern of labor economists , the shrinking options for men in the bottom half of the income scale , Schmitt explains .
" It strikes me as a bit of a stretch to say , after all these years of studying the issue , ' Oh , my gosh , what these low - income men decided to do was take more leisure time . ' "
( Hurst counters that fully half of the increase in leisure time comes from the part of the sample that is employed full - time . )
Other critics point out that by focusing on the increase in average leisure time , it 's easy to miss all the people who are seeing less .
The sociologist Jerry Jacobs rattles off categories of people whose ranks have grown markedly since 1965 : Men who work more than 50 hours a week , women who do so , couples who work more than 100 hours weekly .
Sixty percent of married couples today include both a male and female earner , he points out -- and on average those couples work 82 hours a week .
Those figures were simply unheard of in 1965 .
" Time - diary studies are useful in some ways , but one thing that drives me crazy about them is that people who use them tend to look for national averages , " says Jacobs , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and coauthor of " The Time Divide . "
But , as you trudge to work on Monday , forget that academics are warring over just how overworked you are .
( Forget , too , that an extra half - hour here and there is just not the same as a month on the Riviera . )
Think , instead , lovingly , of those seven extra weeks of vacation that two economists have just announced that you have .

Volunteers write and edit the site 's thousands of articles
The editor , known as Essjay , had described himself as a professor of religion at a private university .
But he was in fact Ryan Jordan , 24 , a college student from Kentucky who used texts such as Catholicism for Dummies .
He has now retired from the site .
Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia open to all , written by volunteers worldwide .
' Trust and tolerance '
Under the name Essjay , Mr Jordan edited articles and also had the authority to arbitrate disputes between authors .
In his user profile , he said he taught both undergraduate and graduate theology , and in an interview with the New Yorker in July 2006 , was described as a " tenured professor of religion " .
His real identity came to light last week when the magazine added an editorial note to the piece highlighting the deception .
" At the time of publication , neither we nor Wikipedia knew Essjay 's real name , " the note said .
Essjay told them he hid his identity because " he feared personal retribution from those he had ruled against online " , the magazine 's note said .
Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales , writing on the site on 3 March , said that Mr Jordan was apologetic , but that Wikipedia was " based on twin pillars of trust and tolerance " .
" Despite my personal forgiveness , I hope that he will accept my resignation request , because forgiveness or not , these positions are not appropriate for him now , " he wrote .
And in a post the next day , Mr Jordan announced his retirement from the site .
" I hope others will refocus the energy they have spent the past few days in defending and denouncing me to make something here at Wikipedia better , " he said .
Given the peace , tranquility , and general happiness that orgasms can bring , it may be shocking to learn that many women have a difficult or even impossible time reaching this state of sexual bliss .
It is important to understand that there is nothing physically wrong with women who cannot orgasm .
On the contrary , most women can reach the peaks that they desire by overcoming these ten common reasons ( in no particular order ) why women do n’t orgasm ;
One of the most important things that a woman needs to have an orgasm is a clear mind .
She should be able to focus on the pleasure that she feels , not the desired outcome of that pleasure .
When a woman gets too caught up in worrying about whether or not she will have an orgasm , she can get distracted .
This , in turn , makes it even harder for her to have an orgasm .
By reducing the pressure level and enjoying sexual acts for what they are , women will be much more likely to relax and let go .
When it comes to sexual satisfaction , communication is key .
Unfortunately , only 22 percent of couples are willing to communicate their sexual needs to one another .
This lack of communication can make it very difficult for a woman to verbalize what she needs in order to orgasm .
By explaining her desires , a woman has a much higher success rate of reaching the orgasm that she craves .
Mildewed and damp , they are an incongruous sight in the middle of a jungle .
But the three portraits of Britain 's Prince Philip , husband to Queen Elizabeth II , are the most prized possessions of a cluster of villages in the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu .
As unlikely as it sounds , a few thousand villagers on the island of Tanna worship the 85 - year - old prince as a deity , holding hope that he will one day appear among them , dispensing gifts .
For years , they say , he has moved among them in spirit .
" He is a god , not a man , " says village chief Jack Naiva , a wiry , elderly man with graying hair and broken teeth .
" Sometimes we hear his voice , but we can't see him . "
The unusual beliefs held by the inhabitants of Yaohnanen and surrounding villages in the jungles of Tanna first emerged in the 1960s , anthropologists say .
Villagers took an ancient prophecy that the son of a mountain spirit would venture faraway in search of a powerful woman to marry and melded it with what Christian missionaries had taught them about the returning Messiah .
Their convictions were bolstered by the respect accorded the Duke of Edinburgh by the colonial authorities of the Anglo - French territory of the New Hebrides – as Vanuatu was known until independence in 1980 .
Villagers were used to seeing the prince 's portrait , and that of the queen , in police stations and government offices .
Their veneration for the queen 's consort is tinged with irony , given Philip 's history of politically incorrect gaffes about foreigners and minorities .
He once asked a group of Australian Aborigines if they still threw spears at one another ; he inquired of a black British member of parliament what country he came from , and he advised some British students in China not to stay too long for fear of developing " slitty eyes . "
But such faux pas are unknown to the villagers of Tanna , who have very little concept of the outside world .
Their lives could hardly be further removed from the opulence enjoyed by the prince and " Misis Kwin , " the pidgin name for the queen .
The village – situated on an 80 - island archipelago – lies at the end of a muddy track barely navigable by four - wheel - drive vehicles .
Few Tannese have ever left the island , and villages have no electricity , no running water , and no school .
There are no newspapers , radios , or TVs , and life has changed little since Tanna was first encountered by Capt .
James Cook in 1774 .
Children – picaninis in pidgin English – run around naked or in ragged clothes , and men wear either dirty shorts or nambas , grass penis sheaths .
They hunt wild pigs and fruit bats with bows and arrows .
The prince 's status among islanders received a boost in 1971 when , resplendent in a white naval uniform , he steamed into the New Hebrides capital , Port Vila , with the queen .
Chief Jack traveled 150 miles by sea especially for the event .
The Prince Philip cult is just one of several " cargo cults " that began emerging in the south Pacific with the first Western colonization in the 1800s .
As strange as they may seem , cargo cults were a highly complex reaction by bewildered islanders to the influence of Western modernity .
" Movements like these were a way for traditional people to come to terms with colonialism and Christianity , " says Kirk Huffman , a British anthropologist who lived in Vanuatu for 17 years .
" Vanuatu 's culture would have been entirely squashed if it was n't for cults like [ these ] . "
Often they put their faith in a Christ - like messiah who would chase away colonial overlords and bring wealth , or " cargo . "
Such beliefs were reinforced by the arrival of US forces in the South Pacific during World War II .
The avalanche of materiel – battleships , bulldozers , medicines , and ration packs – astonished islanders .
They were also impressed by black American soldiers who descended with apparently unlimited candy and Coca - Cola .
Around 1,000 men from Tanna worked as porters and laborers for the US military on the New Hebrides islands of Efate and Espiritu Santo .
It is a period of the war immortalized by James Michener in " Tales of the South Pacific . "
To this day villagers in one part of Tanna believe in the eventual arrival of a messiah they call Jon Frum – thought to be a contraction of " John from America , " perhaps a GI who showed them particular regard , anthropologists speculate .
Every year on February 15 , followers show their devotion to this shadowy American spirit by daubing the letters U - S - A in red paint on their chests , dressing in GI - style uniforms , and marching barefoot around a parade ground beneath a fluttering Stars and Stripes .
Shouldering bamboo " rifles , " they execute perfect drills in the shadow of Mount Yasur , an active volcano .
In the past , the cult – to which at least half of Tanna 's 20,000 people adhere – built makeshift runways , piers , and wooden planes to tempt the Americans and their cargo back to the island .
" Towers with tin cans strung from wires , imitating radio stations , were erected so Jon Frum could ' speak ' to his people , " writes travel guide author David Stanley in his book " South Pacific . "
Dozens of similar cults arose across the region .
In 1964 , when the first elections were held for Papua 's House of Assembly , the inhabitants of New Hanover Island decided they wanted as their candidate US President Lyndon Johnson .
They refused to pay taxes and instead put their money into a fund to entice LBJ to stand for them .
They were disappointed when he failed to turn up .
Most of the cults have withered away , but Tanna remains a stronghold .
" Cults like this are a way to preserve traditional culture and reject organized religion , " says Ralph Regenvanu , director of the Vanuatu National Cultural Council .
" There was a great deal of pressure from missionaries for people to abandon their customs and embrace the church . "
To islanders ' dismay , the British and French tried to ban polygamy , dancing , and kava , a narcotic beverage made from pepper plant roots .
" The colonial authorities arrested a lot of the cult leaders , but that only made them grow more , " Mr. Regenvanu says .
" It 's still basically a cultural preservation movement ....
It melds exposure to the West with old belief systems .
It 's served people well . "
Prince Philip is well aware of the distant adoration and has allowed staff to discreetly send his devotees framed portraits of himself .
The villagers fetch them from a thatched hut and present them reverently to visitors .
The first , a black - and - white print now badly damaged by damp , dates from the early ' 60s .
The second shows the prince holding a pig - killing nal - nal club in 1980 .
The most recent was sent in 2000 .
Letters from Buckingham Palace were also highly prized , but humidity and mice destroyed them .
Despite venerating the prince for half a century , the villagers – none of whom can read or write – only learned recently that his birthday falls on June 10 .
Great plans are now under way to celebrate the occasion this year with feasting and dancing .
Chief Jack has even managed to acquire a new Union Jack , which will be run up a bamboo flagpole and saluted .
The celebrations will only really be complete if Prince Philip himself turns up , the chief says .
" You must tell King Philip that I 'm getting old and I want him to come and visit me , " he says .
" If he can't come perhaps he could send us some things to help us : a Land Rover , bags of rice , or a little money . "
This islanders ' devotion to such a distant figure is perhaps not unusual , anthropologists insist .
" If you say to the Tannese , ' You 've been waiting all this time and neither Jon Frum nor Philip has turned up , ' they point out that Christians have been waiting for the return of Jesus for 2,000 years , " says Mr. Huffman .
" This is not South Seas mumbo jumbo – these are strong , vibrant millennial movements , and they are only getting stronger . "
When Tony Blair announced his resignation after ten years as prime minister of the United Kingdom , his voice choked with emotion and he nearly shed a tear .
He asked his audience to believe that
he had always done what
he thought was right .
He would have been nearer the mark had he said that he always thought that what was right was whatever he had done .
Throughout his years
in office , he kept inviolable
his belief in the existence of
a purely beneficent essence of himself , a belief so strong that no quantity of untruthfulness , shady dealings , unscrupulousness , or constitutional impropriety could undermine or destroy it .
Having come into the world marked by Original Virtue , Blair was also a natural - born preacher .
In a confessional mood , Blair admitted that he had sometimes fallen short of what was expected of him .
He did not give specifics , but we were expected to admire his candor and humility in making such an admission .
It is no coincidence , however , that Blair reached maturity at the time of the publication of the famous book Psychobabble , which dissects the modern tendency to indulge in self - obsession without self - examination .
Here was a mea culpa without the culpa .
Bless me , people ( Blair appeared to be saying ) , for I have sinned : but please do n’t ask me to say how .
There undoubtedly were things to be grateful for during the Blair years .
His support for American policy in Iraq won him much sympathy in the U.S. , of course .
He was often eloquent in defense of liberty .
And under Blair ’s leadership , Britain enjoyed ten years of uninterrupted economic growth , leaving large parts of the country prosperous as never before .
London became one of the world ’s richest cities , vying with New York to be the global economy ’s financial center .
Blair
did inherit a strapping economy from his predecessor , and he left its management more or less to the man who succeeds him , Gordon Brown .
Still , unlike previous Labour prime ministers , he did not preside over an economic crisis : in itself , something to be proud of .
But how history will judge him overall , and whether it will absolve him ( to adapt slightly a phrase coined by a famous , though now ailing , Antillean dictator ) , is another matter .
Strictly speaking , history does n’t absolve , or for that matter vindicate , anybody ; only people absolve or vindicate , and except in the most obvious cases of villainy or sainthood , they come to different conclusions , using basically the same evidence .
There can thus be no definitive judgment of Blair , especially one contemporaneous with his departure .
Still , I will try .
Blair ’s resignation announcement was typical of the man and , one must admit , of the new culture from which he emerged : lachrymose and self - serving .
It revealed an unfailing eye and ear for the ersatz and the kitsch , which allowed him so long to play upon
the sensibilities of a large section of the population as upon a pipe .
He knew exactly what to say of Princess Diana when she died in a car accident , for example : that she was “ the people ’s princess . ”
He sensed acutely that the times were not so much democratic as demotic : that economic egalitarianism having suffered a decisive defeat both in theory and practice , the only mass appeal left to a politician calling himself radical was to cultural egalitarianism .
He could gauge the feelings of the people because , in large part , he shared them .
A devotee himself of
the cult of celebrity , in which the marriage of glamour and banality both reassures democratic sentiment and stimulates fantasies of luxury , he sought the company of minor show - business personalities and stayed in their homes during his holidays .
The practical demonstration that he worshiped at the same shrines as the people did , that his tastes were the same as theirs , more than compensated for the faint odor of impropriety that this gave off .
And differences of taste , after all , unite or divide men more profoundly than anything else .
No prime minister had ever been at once so ubiquitous and so inaccessible .
Instinctively understanding the dynamics of the cult of celebrity , Blair was both familiar ( he insisted on being known by a diminutive ) and distant ( he acted more as head of state than as head of government , and spent three times more on his own office than did his predecessor ) .
Having invited 60 ordinary citizens into Downing Street so that they could give him their views , and so that he could say that he listened to the people , he proceeded to address them via a huge plasma screen , though he was in the building .
So near , and yet so far : this was a grand vizier ’s durbar for the age of virtual reality .
With Blair , communication , like time ’s arrow , flew in one direction only .
Tony Blair was the perfect politician for an age of short attention spans .
What he said on one day had no necessary connection with what he said on the following day : and if someone pointed out the contradiction , he would use his
favorite phrase , “ It ’s time to move on , ” as if detecting contradictions in what he said were some kind of curious
psychological symptom in the person detecting them .
Many have surmised that there was an essential flaw in Blair ’s makeup that turned him gradually from the most popular to the most unpopular prime minister of recent history .
The problem is to name that essential flaw .
As a psychiatrist , I found this problem peculiarly irritating ( bearing
in mind that it is always highly speculative to make a diagnosis at a distance ) .
But finally , a possible solution arrived in
a flash of illumination .
Blair suffered from a condition previously unknown to me : delusions of honesty .
Blair came to power promising that his government would be “ purer than pure , ” an expression both self - righteous and somewhat foolish , given the fallen nature of man .
The Tories preceding him in government had become notorious for acts of corruption that now appear trifling .
Indeed , one objection to those acts — for example , asking questions in the House of Commons in return for payment , handed under the table in used banknotes wrapped in brown paper envelopes — was the derisory sums involved .
What kind of person would risk ruin for amounts of money that honest people could make in a week or two ?
Soon after Blair took office , however , a billionaire named Bernie Ecclestone offered the Labour Party a $ 2 million
donation if the government exempted Formula 1 motor racing , which he controlled , from the ban on cigarette ads at sporting events .
The government granted the exemption .
After public exposure , Blair declared himself to be such a “ straight kind of guy ” that it was inconceivable that he had involved himself in such an unsavory arrangement — though clearly he had .
It was his capacity to believe his own
untruths that proved so persuasive to others ; it was among his greatest political assets .
Such scandals — involving
favors granted to rich men ,
followed , after exposure , by protestations of injured innocence — punctuated Blair ’s tenure with monotonous regularity .
One of the more notorious was the letter that Blair sent to the Romanian prime minister , Adrian Nastase , encouraging him to sell the state - owned steel producer Sidex to billionaire industrialist Lakshmi Mittal ; it would help Romania ’s application to join the European Union , Blair argued , if a British company bought the steel producer .
But Mittal ’s company was not British ; of its 125,000 employees , only 100 worked in Britain ; indeed , Mittal himself was not British .
He had , however , donated $ 250,000 to Labour shortly beforehand .
Far from being purer than pure , Blair was laxly forgiving of impropriety in others , provided that they were loyal
or politically useful to him .
The case of Peter Mandelson is
particularly instructive .
When first a minister , Mandelson borrowed a large sum of money from another minister , Geoffrey Robinson , a multimillionaire , in order to buy a house .
Not only did Mandelson fail to tell the bank that lent him the rest of the money for the purchase that the money he had in hand was not his own ( in less well - connected mortals , that would be
considered fraud ) ; the government department that Mandelson headed at the time was investigating Robinson ’s own business affairs for suspected improprieties .
Public exposure forced Blair to accept Mandelson ’s resignation .
But the prime minister soon reappointed Mandelson
to the cabinet .
Blair accepted Mandelson ’s resignation a second time , however , when it emerged that he had pushed through the passport application of one of the Hinduja brothers , Indian businessmen accused of corruption in
India , after a $ 2 million donation to Labour .
Blair then rewarded Mandelson with the
lucrative and powerful post of European Commissioner .
What is one to conclude from this ?
Having come into power deeply critical of the previous government ’s use of private consultants , Blair promptly increased spending on them at least tenfold , ensuring the loyalty of senior civil servants ( traditionally a professional cadre , not political appointees ) by allowing them to cross
back and forth between public and private employment , enriching themselves enormously at public expense in the process .
Thus Blair played Mephistopheles to the civil
service ’s Faust , introducing levels of corruption and patronage not seen in Britain since the eighteenth century .
Huge sums of money have disappeared , as if into a black hole , into such organizations as the National Health Service , where bureaucracies have hugely expanded and entwined their interests so closely with those of private suppliers and consultancies that it is difficult to distinguish public from private any longer .
Spending on the NHS has increased by two and a half times in the space of ten years ; yet it is hard to see any corresponding improvement
in the service , other than in the standard of living of those who work in it .
Blair even became the first serving prime minister in history to find himself questioned by the police in Downing Street , under caution of self - incrimination , in the course of
a criminal investigation — in this case , into the selling of seats in the House of Lords .
Small wonder that for much of the population , truth and Blair now appear to inhabit parallel universes .
Reflecting the country ’s mood is the famous remark that Gordon Brown made to Blair : “ There is nothing that you could say to me now that I could ever believe . ”
Blair proved unusually expert in the postmodernist art of spin .
A political advisor to the government perfectly captured this approach on September 11 , 2001 , when she said that it was “ a good day to bury bad news . ”
In other words , you can get away with anything if the timing is right .
At the outset of his tenure , Blair said that his government would be tough on crime and on the causes of crime .
He wanted to appeal — and succeeded in appealing — to two constituencies at once : those who wanted criminals locked up , and those who saw crime as the natural consequence of social injustice , a kind of inchoate protest against the conditions in which they lived .
Blair ’s resultant task was to obfuscate , so that the electorate and even experts could not find out , without great difficulty , what was going on .
For example , Blair ’s government , aware of public unrest about the number of criminals leaving prison only to commit further serious crimes , introduced indeterminate sentencing — open - ended imprisonment — apparently a tough response to repeat offenders .
But the reality was different : the sentencing judges still had the discretion to determine such criminals ’ parole dates , which , in England , are de facto release dates .
The sentences that criminals would serve , in other words , would be no longer than before the new law .
Another way to confuse the public was to corrupt official statistics .
Last year , to take
one example , the government dropped three simple but key measures from the compendious statistics that it gathers about people serving community sentences — that is , various kinds of service and supervision outside prison : their
criminal histories prior to sentencing , their reconviction rates , and the number given prison sentences while serving their community sentences .
Instead , it introduced an utterly meaningless measure , at least from a public - safety perspective : the proportion of people with community sentences who abide by such conditions as weekly attendance for an hour at a probation office .
The police also received encouragement to keep crime numbers down by not recording crimes .
The crime rate has fallen in part because shoplifting has ceased to be a crime , for instance .
Police now deal with it the way they do with parking violations : shoplifters get on - the - spot fines worth half , on average , of the value of the goods that they have stolen .
The problem of unemployment in Britain illustrates perfectly the methods that Blair ’s government used to obscure the truth .
The world generally believes that , thanks to Labour ’s prudent policies , Britain now enjoys low unemployment ; indeed , Blair has often lectured other leaders on the subject .
The low rate is not strictly a lie : those counted officially as unemployed are today relatively few .
Unfortunately , those counted as sick are many ; and if you add the numbers of unemployed and sick together , the figure remains remarkably constant in recent years , oscillating around 3.5 million , though the proportion of sick to unemployed has risen rapidly .
Approximately 2.7 million people are receiving
disability benefits in Britain , 8 or 9 percent of the workforce , highly concentrated in the areas of former unemployment ; more people are claiming that psychiatric disorders prevent them from working than are claiming that work is unavailable .
In the former coal - mining town of Merthyr Tydfil ,
about a quarter of the adult population is on disability .
Britain is thus the ill man of Europe , though all objective indicators suggest that people are living longer and healthier lives than ever .
Three groups profit from this statistical legerdemain : first , the unemployed themselves , because disability benefits are about 60 percent higher than unemployment benefits , and , once one is receiving them , one does not have to pretend to be looking for work ; second , the doctors who make the bogus diagnoses , because by doing so they remove a possible cause of conflict with their patients and , given the assault rate on British doctors , this is important to them ; and finally , the government , which can claim to have reduced unemployment .
But such obfuscation is destructive of human personality .
The unemployed have to pretend something untrue — namely , that they are sick ; the medical profession winds up humiliated and dispirited by taking part in fraud ; and the government avoids , for a time , real economic problems .
Thus the whole of society finds itself corrupted and infantilized by its inability to talk straight ; and that Blair could speak with conviction of the low unemployment rate , and believe that he was telling the truth , is to me worse than if he had been a dastardly cynic .
Tony Blair ’s most alarming characteristic , however , has been his enmity to freedom in his own country , whatever his feelings about it in other countries .
No British prime minister in 200 years has done more to curtail civil liberties than has Blair .
Starting with an assumption of his infinite beneficence , he assumed infinite responsibility , with the result that Britain has become
a country with a degree of official surveillance that would make a Latin American military dictator envious .
Sometimes this surveillance is merely ludicrous — parking - enforcement officers ’ wearing miniature closed - circuit security cameras in their caps to capture abusive responses from those ticketed , say , or local councils ’ attaching sensing devices to the garbage cans of 3 million homes to record what people throw away , in order to charge them for the quantity and quality of their trash .
But often the government ’s reach is less innocuous .
For example , in the name of national security , the government under Blair ’s leadership sought to make passport applicants provide 200 pieces of information about themselves , including bank - account details , and undergo interrogation for half an hour .
If an applicant refused to allow the information to circulate through other government departments , he would not get a passport , with no
appeal .
The government also cooked up a plan to require passport holders to inform the police if they changed their address .
A justification presented for these Orwellian arrangements was the revelation that a would - be terrorist , Dhiren Barot , had managed to obtain nine British passports before his arrest because he did
not want an accumulation of stamps from suspect countries in any of them .
At the same time , it came to light that the Passport Office issues 10,000 passports a year to fraudulent applicants — hardly surprising , since its staff consists largely of immigrants , legal and illegal .
As was often the case with Blair and his government , the solution proposed was not only completely disproportionate to the problem ; it was not even a solution .
The government has admitted that criminal gangs have already forged the U.K. ’s new high - tech passports .
The only people , then , whom the process will trouble are the people who need no surveillance .
No sensible person denies the danger of Islamic extremism in Britain ; but just as the fact that the typical Briton finds himself recorded by security cameras 300 times a day does not secure him in the slightest from crime or antisocial behavior , which remain prevalent in Britain , so no one feels any safer from the terrorist threat despite the ever - increasing government surveillance .
Blair similarly showed no
respect for precedent and
gradual reform by Parliament itself , which — in the absence
of an American - style written
constitution — have been the
nation ’s guiding principles .
By decree , he made the civil
service answerable to unelected political allies , for the first time in history ; he devoted far less attention to Parliament than did any previous prime minister ; the vast majority of legislation under his premiership ( amounting to a blizzard so great that lawyers cannot keep up with it ) passed without
effective parliamentary oversight , in effect by decree ; one new criminal offense was
created every day except
Sundays for ten years , 60 percent of them by such decree , ranging from the selling of gray squirrels and Japanese bindweed to failure to nominate someone to turn off
your house alarm if it triggers while you are out ; he abolished the independence of the House of Lords , the only , and very limited , restraint on the elected government ’s power ; he eliminated the immemorial jurisprudential rule against double jeopardy ; he wanted
to introduce preventive detention for people whom doctors deemed dangerous , even though they had as yet committed no crime ; he passed a Civil Contingencies
Act that permits the British government , if it believes that an emergency anywhere in the world threatens serious damage to human welfare or to the environment in Britain , to confiscate or destroy property without compensation .
That Blair should have turned out to be so authoritarian ought to come as no surprise to those who listened to the timbre of some of his early pronouncements .
His early emphasis on youth ; his pursuit of what he called , grandiosely , the Third Way ( as if no one had thought of it before ) ; his desire to create a “ New Britain ” ; his assertion that the Labour Party was the political arm of the British people ( as if people who did not support it were in some way not British ) — some have thought all this
contained a Mussolinian , or possibly Peronist , ring .
It is ridiculous to say that Tony Blair was a fascist ; but it would be equally absurd to see him as a defender of liberty , at least in his own country .
Blair found the Muslim threat far easier to tackle abroad than at home , perhaps because it required less courage .
Intentionally or not , he pandered to domestic Muslim sentiment .
During the general election , in which the leader and deputy leader of the opposition were Jewish , he allowed Labour to portray them as pigs on election campaign posters .
The Jewish vote in Britain is small , and scattered throughout the country ; the Muslim vote is large , and concentrated in constituencies upon which the whole election might turn .
It is not that Blair is anti-Semitic : no one would accuse him of that .
It is simply that , if mildly anti-Semitic connotations served his purposes , he would use them , doubtless persuaded that it was for the higher good of mankind .
Further , Blair ’s wife , Cherie , is a lawyer who now practices little , but who by convenient coincidence — immediately before a general election , and at a time of Muslim disaffection with Labour over the Iraq War — appeared before the highest court in the land , defending a 15 - year - old girl who claimed the right to wear full Muslim dress in school .
It turned out that an extreme British Islamic group backed the case legally and financially .
Blair also presided over the extension of mail voting in Muslim areas , despite having been warned about the likely consequence : that frequently , the male heads of households would vote for all registered voters under their roofs .
Indeed , it is difficult to resist the conclusion that Blair supported voting by mail because of this consequence , which would tip the vote toward the many Labour candidates who were Muslim men themselves .
Pro-Labour fraud became so widespread that the judge leading a judicial inquiry into an election in Birmingham concluded that it would have disgraced a banana republic .
The prime minister also proved exceptionally feeble during the Danish cartoon crisis , and repeatedly said things about Islam — that it is a religion of peace , for one — that he must have known to be untrue .
Blair , then , is no hero .
Many in Britain believe that he has been the worst prime minister in recent British history , morally and possibly financially corrupt , shallow and egotistical , a man who combined the qualities of Elmer Gantry with those of Juan Domingo Perón .
America should think twice about taking him to its heart now that he has stepped down .
Andy Schlafly was appalled .
He was teaching a history class to home - schooled teens and one student had just turned in an assignment that dated events as “ BCE , ” before the common era -- rather than “ BC , ” before Christ .
“ Where did that come from ? ” he demanded .
Her answer : “ Wikipedia . ”
At that , Schlafly knew he had to act .
In his mind , the popular online encyclopedia -- written and edited by self - appointed experts worldwide -- was riddled with liberal bias .
Dating events without referring to the New Testament was just one example .
How about Wikipedia ’s entry on golfer Zach Johnson , winner of the 2007 Masters ?
Not a single word about how Johnson gave credit for his win to Jesus Christ .
Advertisement
Thus was born Conservapedia.com -- labeled “ a conservative encyclopedia you can trust . ”
Schlafly , 46 , started small , urging his students to post brief -- often one - sentence -- entries on ancient history .
He went live with the site in November .
In the last six months , it ’s grown explosively , offering what Schlafly describes as fair , scholarly articles .
Many have a distinctly religious - right perspective .
Take the Pleistocene Epoch .
Most scientists know it as the ice age and date it back at least 1.6 million years .
But Conservapedia calls it “ a theorized period of time ” -- a theory contradicted , according to the entry , by “ multiple lines of evidence ” indicating that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old , as described in the Book of Genesis .
“ We have certain principles that we adhere to , and we are up - front about them , ” Schlafly writes in his mission statement .
“ Beyond that we welcome the facts . ”

Conservapedia defines environmentalists as “ people who profess concern about the environment ” and notes that some would want to impose legal limits on the use of toilet paper .
Femininity ?
The quality of being “ childlike , gentle , pretty , willowy , submissive . ”
A hike in minimum wage is referred to as “ a controversial manoeuvre that increases the incentive for young people to drop out of school . ”
And the state of the economy under President Bush ?
Much better than the “ liberal media ” would have you think : “ For example , during his term Exxon Mobile has posted the largest profit of any company in a single year , and executive salaries have greatly increased as well . ”

With fewer than 12,000 entries and typos galore ( the misspelling of Mobil above ; the mayor of L.A. is referred to as “ Anthony Varigoso ” ) , Conservapedia is n’t about to supplant Wikipedia -- which boasts 1.8 million articles in English alone .
But the all - volunteer site has several thousand active readers and writers .
Schlafly encourages his students to use it as a reference , saying that the articles are more concise than those on Wikipedia .
On the home page , just above the daily Bible verse , he tallies total views : 12.3 million and counting .
Conservapedia ’s critics for the most part have no problem with the articles heaping praise on former President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher , former prime minister of Britain .
But they worry about material presented as fact in science and medicine entries that typically seek to debunk evolution , condemn homosexuality and raise fears about abortion .
They ’re also concerned that children who stumble onto the site will assume everything in it is authoritative .
Schlafly says students can always follow the footnotes to get more information , but few links connect to dissenting -- or even mainstream -- views .

“ The project specifically targets high - schoolers , and that ’s probably what I find most dangerous , ” said Andreas Kjeldsen , 27 , a Danish graduate student who wrote several entries on medieval history before stopping in protest .
Many , perhaps most , of Conservapedia ’s articles are free of ideology .
There are brisk , straightforward entries about hundreds of topics : the tuba , Claude Monet , the nation of Latvia , Robin Hood , polygons , the Renaissance .
But consider the entry on Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton ( b. 1947 ) .
She “ may suffer from a psychological condition that would raise questions about her fitness for office ” -- namely , “ clinical narcissism , ” Conservapedia asserts .
Evidence of her instability includes her “ ever - changing opinion of the Iraq war . ”
Though Schlafly demands that entries be rigorously footnoted , these sentences are not .
Schlafly calls the armchair psychology “ borderline in acceptability ” for his site , but he defends the Clinton article on balance as “ an objective , bias - free piece from a conservative perspective . ”

The whole point of his encyclopedia , he said , is to provide a different angle on the facts -- ones that a student researcher would n’t necessarily find on Wikipedia , or in the school library .
Schlafly , the son of Republican activist Phyllis Schlafly , is a Harvard - educated attorney who practices in Chester , N.J .
He does not know most of Conservapedia ’s contributors ; they ’re spread out across the world and communicate through online pseudonyms .
He promotes writers he finds trustworthy to be systems administrators , who are able to block editors and protect certain articles from changes .
Even among this elite group , there ’s no ideological conformity .
Terry Koeckritz does n’t take the creation account in the Book of Genesis literally , but he enjoys the site and spends hours writing articles on topics such as Fox News .
“ It is what it is , ” said Koeckritz , 56 , a computer consultant in Reno .
“ A family - friendly , Christian - friendly encyclopedia . ”

That makes it an interesting window into a foreign world for college student Tasha D. Jones , 24 , who says she loves to browse random pages and see how writers have inserted Biblical quotes or framed historical events in religious terms .
“ It gives me a better understanding of how people feel religion relates to our lives , ” said Jones , who attends Sacramento City College and has contributed articles on lemons , mangoes and other nonpartisan topics .
The articles change constantly , as most are open to editing by anyone online ; on a recent day , a few showed dissenting views .
An entry about kangaroo origins , for instance , stated that most scientists believe in evolution .
( It was the last line in the entry , after a lengthy discussion about which marsupials Noah may have brought aboard his ark . )
In other cases , a glance at the entry ’s history -- which shows editing over time -- makes clear how quickly dissenting views are deleted .
Dr. Peter A. Lipson , an internist in Southfield , Mich. , repeatedly tried to amend an article on breast cancer to tone down Conservapedia ’s claim that abortion raises a woman ’s risk .
The site ’s administrators , including Schlafly , questioned his credentials and shut off debate .
Advertisement
After administrators blocked their accounts , Lipson and several other editors quit trying to moderate the articles and instead started their own website , RationalWiki.com .
From there , they monitor Conservapedia .
And -- by their own admission -- engage in acts of cyber- vandalism .
In recent months , Conservapedia ’s articles have been hit frequently by interlopers from Rational Wiki and elsewhere .
The vandals have inserted errors , pornographic photos and satire , including this addition to an entry on Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales : “ Mr. Gonzales is a strong supporter of torture as a law enforcement tool for use against Democrats and third world inhabitants . ”
The vandalism aims “ to cause people to say , ‘ That Conservapedia is just wacko , ’ ” said Brian Macdonald , 45 , a Navy veteran in Murfreesboro , Tenn. , who puts in several hours a day on the site fending off malicious editing .

Such aggression has reinforced the view among some Conservapedia writers that left - wingers are out to suppress their free speech .
“ I had heard it spoken of , but it had never really hit home before just how hostile they are , ” said a 15 - year - old in New Jersey whose mother asked that her name not be used .
The girl , who is home - schooled , wrote an article for Conservapedia on Irish dancing and uses the site to research papers .
But the biggest lesson she ’s taken away as a young conservative is : “ There are people who want to destroy us . ”

The rumored pictures seemed plausible enough , and now Apple has confirmed the hopes / fears of typists the world over : there 's a new desktop keyboard ( er , two actually ) in town .
The new keyboards ( one larger wired USB 2.0 edition with two USB 2.0 ports , one smaller Bluetooth 2.0 flavor ) are crafted from anodized aluminum , and include dedicated keys for screen dimmer / brighter , expose , media controls , volume controls , and eject for optical drive .
Clearly , they 're making an obvious play to capture that good will the MacBook has garnered for its interesting spacing and flat keys , but it remains to be seen if such a laptop - ish keyboard can keep up with the more tactile big boys on the desktop frontier .
But hey , with that much sexy , we 're willing to find out .

According to this article , Barry Goldwater ’s book , The Conscience of a Conservative , is being reissued .
Timely reading ?
Depends on what audience at which this is aimed .
I seriously doubt conservatives of the Rove / Norquist stripe will have much sympathy with Goldwater , who now seems admirable and even iconic compared to the dunces dancing to the tune of the Far Right today .
It might be well to remember that traditional conservatism bears little substantive resemblance to what passes as popular conservatism today .
Since Reagan , the Right has taken up the gauntlet of attack as its primary ethic , and this is now costing them .
It has been asked in recent decades just what Liberals stand for , but I think the question is better applied to Conservatives .
A quick glance at the Right ’s c.v.s suggests they stand for fewer taxes , more rigid controls on judicial interference with private business , fewer taxes , banning sex , fewer taxes , weakening environmental conservation , fewer taxes , more expensive health care , fewer taxes …
Not an impressive list .
They have become reactive , even when they clearly had won the field in popular support , shouting back at the Left as if people still were n’t listening , and it has become all they seem to do .
Goldwater ’s considered conservatism is almost balm - like in its relative rationalism .
Conservatism itself has never been a bad thing .
Harkening back to an earlier time , all it meant was being more cautious , being less willing to spend public money on “ What if ? ” proposals , and being averse to change for change ’s sake .
It meant relying on the vast resource of the private sector to solve most problems instead of assuming that corporations automatically meant bad things about to happen .
Liberalism , on the other hand , was once all about Free Markets .
Laissez - faire capitalism is a liberal invention .
It meant , in this formulation , opening up opportunities for those kept artificially out by a staid and traditional set of procedures .
Things change .
We have now devolved in politics to what amounts to screaming matches , cut fights , and ritual playground games , with both sides lining up on opposite sides to denounce anything the other side offers .
It has perverted the discourse .
Consider : birth control is a privacy issue .
It ought to be the most conservative issue we have .
Conservatives who traditionally would denounce any invasion of privacy as an infringement on fundamental rights should embrace the notion of a right to choose almost reflexively .
Consider : Barry Goldwater became a mighty advocate of environmentalism .
Preserving the land , nurturing natural resources , ought to be a seedbed for conservative activism .
Consider : Involvement in foreign wars has been the legacy of our most progressive and ( in a contemporary sense ) Liberal presidents .
Conservatives have generally been averse to what amounts to gunpowder diplomacy , yet that situation has now reversed itself profoundly .
Since the end of WWII , a brand of conservatism has evolved , exemplified early on by writers like Phyllis Schlafly , that has less to do with authentic conservatism and mostly to do with the creation of an established order wherein public policy amounts to little more than protectionism of the privileges of an elite .
The desire for a preconceived social order , supportive of the self - selected “ natural ” rights of those on the top end of private money , has predominated this strain of rightwing thought .
Fewer taxes , to these folks , does not so much equate with less public service as it does to less government oversight .
Environmental policy ends with what one of these folks can see from the front porch of his or her mansion in the midst of a vast estate .
Denial of birth control has less to do with any moral right than it is a method of keeping the lower incomes population bound to a cycle of child - rearing that makes it virtually impossible for most of them ever to rise up economically –or intellectually –to challenge the status quo .
( When I say intellectually , what I mean is this : how many people have the time or resource to continue an education when they have children to raise and more children to raise ?
Some can manage , but without a viable method of child care , this becomes categorically impossible — and what is one of the chief failures of the welfare and antipoverty programs of the past four decades ?
No child care . )
Rove , Norquist , Reed , Schalfly , Coulter , Riley , Limbaugh , Lott …. these folks would not be recognized by Barry Goldwater as conservatives .
They are wanna - be aristos .
But this just makes the response of the Left even more problematic .
Not all aspects of conservatism are repugnant , and not all conservatives are fascists .
It is a mistake to shut out their voices simply because they ’re on the other side of the playground .
Maybe checking out Goldwater ’s book would be a good place to start over .
We might discover , under the detritus of 27 years of ugly schoolyard rumbles , that we have more in common than we think .
Solving financial problems and exploring new opportunities ... investing , saving , financial planning , and the world of personal finance .
I got a couple reactions to my last post .
As I said , it was half baked , which is to say that I did n't know my conclusion when I started writing the post , and I did n't rewrite everything that came ealier once I realized my conclusion .
So they labelled me uninformed , rather than merely disorganized .
I did a fair amount of Smalltalk programming at one time when I was in school .
I drank the Kool Aid , I understood the philosophy , I read the literature .
I only used Squeak , and I am aware that other systems offer more tools .
Those other systems are all proprietary , and sadly the Smalltalk community ( for the most part ) is not a Free Software kind of community .
I 'm sure cool Open Source things happen ( and Squeak is certainly cool ) , but all the most advanced ( most " modern " ) features seem to be proprietary .
Maybe it 's not fair to dismiss them because of that .
But I am not fair and I dismiss them because of that .
And I offer no apologies for this .
Now , working back from my conclusions :
Smalltalk offers no path from here to there .
Smalltalk has a lot of nice things about it .
A lot of them involve different ways of thinking about programming and thinking about the nature of programs themselves .
There 's also the syntax -- it 's not a bad syntax , but it 's not the dominant syntax , and it clashes badly with the dominant syntax .
It 's hard to phrase one in terms of the other ( i.e. , they do not map to each other ) .
The syntax is only a small part of it , but it's one of many things where Smalltalk reinvents everything from the ground up .
Much of it is successful , much of it is particularly elegant when viewed as a whole .
But you take it or you do n't , it 's very hard to go part way .
That 's a huge flaw .
Smalltalk devalues the idea of a " program " .
The Smalltalk image is a lively set of interacting objects , like agents in a community .
It often seems almost spontaneous the way they interact , and it's like they are all peers with no center .
Ravioli code is often the result .
But it 's more than just ravioli code .
Smalltalk encourage a style where there 's often no program at all .
Everything is developed in a persistent environment where there 's little distinction between code and infrastructure .
You open a workspace , set up some objects and tie them together , then trigger a key method that sets it in motion .
But as a result the program is hard to distinguish from your one - time workspace .
Zope has a lot of the same problems , and interestingly this article advises that you follow a methodology that " Devalues the data that goes into any given ZODB storage , " due the challenge of cooperating in such an environment .
I know there exist better tools for Smalltalk collaboration than for Zope .
But they are generally proprietary , so I dismiss them :P ( I do n't live in a Smalltalk world either , so please do n't ask me to choose to abandon my existing tools )
Still , the damage that ravioli code causes should not underestimated !
A quick definition from the wiki page :
In the structured programming world , when things got messy your code became SpaghettiCode .
Everyone knows what SpaghettiCode is .
It has been said that with objects you get RavioliCode : thousands of little classes everywhere and no one knows how to find the places where things really happen .
Again , ravioli code does n't offer a path from here to there .
" Here " in this case is the ignorant programmer first introduced to the code , " there " is the same programmer successfully making whatever change they need to make .
In my experience with ravioli code there is a gestalt which is arrived at in a sudden realization , when the picture comes together .
But before you reach that realization you find yourself in a murky set of code where it is difficult to predict effects or determine causality , and you seldom know how far away you are from the gestalt realization .
This is some of what I was referring to when I said that Smalltalk programming styles led to too many frameworks and not enough libraries -- a framework requires you to take on a certain metaphor of execution , to adapt your thought process to the framework instead of adapting the program to your thoughts .
Frameworks can be worth it , but they always exact a significant cost .
The lack of decent syntactic support for simple imperative programming ( i.e. , functions ) also does n't help Smalltalk be any simpler or more accessible .
I 've become distracted from my main point here : Smalltalk code feels organic and extensible , but it 's not well congealed into something as distinct as a " program " .
The current computing world is a world of programs , not objects .
Maybe we 'll get to that world of objects , but there needs to be a path leading there that starts here .
So maybe my new conclusion is that Smalltalk is uncompromising in its vision , but the world is not ready for that vision .
I say " the world is not ready " from an empirical basis , not as a judgement .
Nor do I judge the world or rail against its ignorance for not embracing a good thing .
The world is what it is , we are where we are .
We can push the world in the direction we choose , but we can only move it , not wish it elsewhere .
( Maybe that 's not fair -- we as individuals can leap about as we wish , for our minds are light ; perhaps this is the nature of invention ; thus my conclusion is self - doubting )
This article is translated to Serbo - Croatian language by Jovana Milutinovich .
Tourism is the world ’s largest export , yet it is ephemeral , produced within an encounter , usually fleeting , between host and guest .
It has enormous growth potential ; almost every country desires an expansion in this sector .
Yet whether and how to grow is not nearly as straightforward as one might hope .
Because each tourist and each native brings along a unique jumble of expectations , knowledge , power , and aspirations , multiplying tourist encounters transforms the tourist and the native , and can permanently alter the social and political contexts in which they live .
When people , who believe they are so different brush up against each other , they exchange more than cash .
Tourism always contains a message : this is what we value , this is what we do n’t .
Tourists come to see some things and not others ; they vote with their money but also with their feet and their eyes and ears .
Local people look back , and change as a result .
Natural sites and ceremonies change in response to the presence of tourists .
International tourism presents itself as straightforward , passive and benign , yet it is complex , interesting and important , full of contradictions and depths .
Here are nine of tourism ’s most conflicting paradoxes :
1 . Only through artifice can locals meet the tourist demand for authenticity .
By definition , tourists travel to encounter the different , the original , the authentic .
In this globalizing world , what they want is regional and unique .
Only through display and packaging are they confident about what is worthy of attention .
As Dean MacCannell explains in The Tourist , there must be an obvious front to an attraction ; only by going through it into the ‘ back ’ do tourists know themselves to be in the zone of the authentic .
Natural sites , too , need to be framed .
Gates , permits , and interpretive texts set them apart from the mundane .
Complicated staging allows tourists to recognize , by sight , the actual thing .
Of course , living culture and the natural world are characterized by being integral , not at all separated .
2 . To capitalize on what you already have , you must borrow .
Tourism can provide the ideal export for developing countries , which avoid debt by capitalizing on what they already have : a unique culture , a singular natural environment , and a definite place in world history .
However , this means airports , major sanitation facilities , local transportation , hydroelectric plants , medical facilities , and hotels .
The government faces a choice : it could build them itself .
The financing would come from foreign lenders , placing the country in debt , or come from local tax revenue , making local people pay for major infrastructure and services that will only be used by outsiders .
Or the government could allow others to build .
With foreign investment , the country relieves itself of providing capital , but forgoes profits .
3 . What is environmentally sustainable is often unprofitable and insulting .
Environmental degradation results from tourism as well as from general human activity .
Ecotourism developed as a way to prevent and reverse this damage .
Ecotourists distance themselves from mainstream hotel tourists ; they pay to sleep in tents on platforms in tropical rainforests , to swim along reefs , to walk over a tree canopy on a net bridge .
What is fortunate for the birds is not always so fortunate for the local people .
They value the ecosystem as it is and are willing to pay for its preservation .
In this way , they create an incentive for local people to refrain from using natural resources for short - term gain .
What is fortunate for the birds is not always so fortunate for the local people .
In order to be environmentally sustainable , eco-tourists have to be few in number .
The economies of scale that allow tourism to be profitable cannot operate in a small bush camp .
Ecotourism proves that tourism does not have to be in conflict with environmental preservation .
Unfortunately , it also proves that the realm in which the environment and the economy can be mutually supporting is tiny .
4. Commodifying culture simultaneously preserves , transforms , and destroys it .
Tourism favors the visible parts of a culture ( handicrafts , costume , and architecture ) , and slides over those that are not , like the rules governing seating on a bus , assumptions about clergy , or bases for legitimate authority .
In this way , tourism favors what can be commodified .
One way to preserve traditional crafts and folkways is to market tradition , using the production process and ethnic - heritage connection as a brand name that increases the value of an otherwise uncompetitive item .
Because souvenir stores sell baskets , weavings , carvings and preserved foods , all typically produced by women , the result of exposure to the market can raise the position of women relative to men , and the position of the household economy relative to that of the formal economy .
But it also alienates the producer from what is being produced , as mass production eschews meaning .
When non-commodities , such as religious objects , go up for sale , not only does their status fall , but their price tags give a clear sense of the worth powerful people accord them .
5 . Money tourists spend to vacation never benefits the local population .
Tourists of every stripe give most of their money to corporations headquartered in and owned by the wealthy countries .
They buy airline tickets from Air France , hotel rooms from Westin , rental cars from National .
Vacationers buy their luggage , bathing suits and fishing gear at local malls and specialty shops before they leave home .
New hotel chains bring blueprints and contractors of their own , marketing departments and managers who come with the hotel .
When tourists buy combination package deals their spending is contained , literally , within the corporate fortress , whose goal is to contain leakage .
6. Governments pursue tourism to benefit the local people , but become oriented toward outsiders .
Tourism promotes an external orientation .
Like other exports , the tourism experience is produced by local people , and consumed by foreigners .
Unlike other exports , it is consumed in the country of production .
This natural external quality combines with international lending conditions to orient the government to foreign , rather than domestic , interests .
To obtain loans and ultimately create revenue , a government ( of whatever size ) has to please outside investors and potential travelers .
Once an airport is built , there are advantages to economy of scale , yet that prevents economic diversification , making the entire economy more dependent on a single , outward - oriented sector .
Tourism lends itself to politics with an authoritarian cast .
7 . Attempts to present living nature or culture to tourists have the effect of deadening them .
Cultural idiosyncracies and natural spectacles change over time .
Tourists can’t be attracted , however , to an unstable and ambiguous culture , nor to a natural site that is in the process of transforming itself .
As a consequence , efforts are made to fix and standardize : folk dances , tortilla - making , and peace pipes , bird habitats and the course of the Amazon have all been bounded and defined .
Real life proceeds around them .
Had they not been fixed , however , they would not be accessible .
Much of the real cultural change comes from tourism itself .
Tourists look , but locals look back .
They see bikinis , independent women , wasted food .
They see Westerners wanting to have their pictures taken with locals , but not to pay them or offer a favor in exchange .
Insofar as culture involves subtle valuations , etiquette , and meanings , tourists at a minimum present an alternative to local culture , and at maximum a critique of it .
8. Tourism is the best possible development sector and the most treacherous .
Whoever owns and runs the main tourist industries profits .
Visitors to and employees of hotels and museums , corporate shareholders and state officials , all can benefit .
Prairies can suddenly become an asset .
Taxes levied on tourists can fund public schools , courts and police .
The tourist enjoys a luxurious holiday , and in exchange local employees , shareholders , and the state all benefit directly .
Many more benefit indirectly as dollars multiply through the regional economy .
Tourism is , however , a risky investment .
Owners have to be careful not to price themselves out of the market .
Even unique sites compete with others .
Beach or jungle countries are interchangeable in tourists ’ eyes .
Investments ca n’t be guaranteed .
Small islands and remote provinces have to maintain airports capable of handling international jumbo jets , have to create roads used mainly by tourists and to provide fresh water for hotels .
Yet volume can be cut to less than half in one day with a single hurricane or a terrorist attack ; or it can peter out more slowly as a resort becomes less desirable .
Empty hotels , wildlife sanctuaries , and jet - skis ca n’t then be turned into anything that local people need .
When successful , countries and localities are faced with a dilemma : allow it to remain an enclave sector , limited in benefits , or force it to grow roots , extending benefits but also deepening dependence on a single , fickle industry .
When unsuccessful , tourism investment is an economic loss like any other , with an added twist .
Governments cannot declare bankruptcy , but are stuck with their losses .
9 . Tourism pretends to be apolitical
When tourists encounter local people , they bring with them the weight of their expectations , their leisure and their power .
Locals see this , and respond : they react against it , make a counter offer , or adapt to expectations .
This seemingly trivial exchange can have profound economic , environmental , cultural and political effects , not only on individuals but on the global political economy .
The exchange it pretends to be passive , yet it is produced by an encounter between host and guest in which anything is possible .

Canaima : Sapo and Sapito falls
Very near from Canaima Lagoon , from a branch of the Carrao river , you will find one of the most beautiful waterfalls in all the region : The Sapo ( Frog ) Fall .
The amount of water is really impressive , specially in the rainy season ( May to November ) .
Panoramic view from the top of the fall .
Enlargement :
The first thing that strikes you , when you get there , is the beauty of the view .
Across the river , you can see the 3 tepuys of Canaima : Zamuro ( Vulture ) , Venado ( Deer ) and Cerbatana ( Blowpipe ) , below the green prairies ( savannas ) .
You could think that before falling , the water from the Carrao river ( the river that leads to Angel Falls ) practices the major fall itself with small steps .

The Allegro CL Source Stepper
Watch the recorded webinar here .
The new Allegro CL Source Stepper is an offering unique to existing Lisp debuggers , and in fact probably unique to source - level debuggers provided by other languages .
The new Allegro Source Stepper provides the following :
Debug / stepping info can be loaded on demand , without recompiling the function under debug .
Assembler instructions can be displayed and stepped .
Macros are rendered transparent , allowing macro forms as well as all levels of their expansions to fully participate in the debug process .
Language personalities can be defined and loaded , which customize the debugger behavior for domain specific languages implemented in Common Lisp .
The source stepper displays source code while stepping through a form .
When using it with the IDE , ( not available on Sparc or AIX platforms ) the source stepper is associated with the new Stepper Dialog .
The Stepper Dialog allows carefully testing compiled code by interrupting execution at selected forms in the original source code and at macroexpansions of the code , allowing state to be examined at each stop point .
The dialog displays the original lisp source code for a function or method that is being stepped through , highlighting the form at which the stepper is stopped .
Button widgets allow proceeding in various ways each time execution has been interrupted .
The dialog also displays macroexpanded forms and the values of arguments and local variables , updated after each step .
The IDE 's code editor can be invoked at any time on the code being stepped through .
The dialog is implemented on top of the base lisp 's stepping facility , which also has a simpler textual interface that can be used in a lisp listener .
See The Lisp DeBug ( ldb ) stepper and The source stepper , both in debugging .htm .
Stepper Dialog Example ( click on picture to enlarge )
The Definition Pane
The Definition Pane ( at the top of the dialog ) shows the source code for the function or method that 's currently being stepped through .
This is a copy of the real source code text , complete with comments and original line breaks .
The form at which the stepper is currently stopped will be highlighted with a different background color .
Red parentheses are drawn around any breakpointed forms .
The breakpointable form under the mouse ( if any ) in the Definition Pane will have a blue border drawn around it .
The form in the Definition Pane where the stepper is stopped is drawn with a background color that can have different meanings .
An explanatory note will appear in the dialog the first three times each highlighting color is used .
The default color is blue .
When green , source - level debugging information is available for the function that the highlighted form will call .
This is a " green light " that pressing the Step Into button will continue doing source - level stepping .
When orange , you are stopped at a macro form .
When gray , it means that no source code range is known for the current step point .
The Form Pane
The Form Pane ( second from the top ) shows just the form at which the stepper is currently stopped .
This form would be executed by a subsequent Step Next .
Sometimes this is a form in the original source code , and is the same as the highlighted form in the Definition Pane , and at other times it is all or part of a macroexpansion .
The Stack Pane
The Stack Pane ( third from the top ) lists the arguments and local variables of the function that is being stepped through , followed by the arguments to the function that called the function being stepped , and then by the arguments to to the next calling function .
Assembly - Language Stepping in the Stepper Dialog
If breakpoints are added to functions for which source - level debugging information is not available , the Stepper Dialog will still display some information and allow stepping to be done .
Documentation
Please refer to the Stepper Dialog documentation for the full details .
International Business Machines Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. , longtime rivals , said IBM will become the first major hardware vendor to resell Sun 's Solaris operating system .
The deal will allow IBM customers to buy Solaris on selected Big Blue server systems , starting with those that use the x86 chip design offered by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. IBM and Sun executives added that the software may later be offered on IBM 's popular mainframe systems .

[ I have recently published a series of posts on airline security at my own blog .
One of the air marshals I quoted , Robert MacLean , mentioned the vulnerability of overnighting aircraft — aircraft parked overnight waiting for the next flight .
He told me that the person to ask about this threat was David Mackett , the president of the Airline Pilots Security Alliance , an organization of pilots concerned with airline security .
I wrote Mr. Mackett and asked him if he could discuss the issue of airline security generally , and overnighting planes specifically .
In response , I received a lengthy and thoughtful e-mail touching on many aspects of airline security , of which the issue of overnighting planes forms only a small part .
Below I have reprinted Mr. Mackett ’s e-mail in its entirety , with only the lightest possible editing .
What you are about to read is a comprehensive , thoughtful , and sobering commentary on the state of airline security , and what can be done about it .
— Patterico ]
As background , no conversation about airline security should take place without at least trying to conceive of the almost incomprehensible size of the air transportation system .
The size of the system is the reason everything the public and policymakers “ think ” should work in airline security does n’t , and the reason our entire approach to airline security is almost completely ineffective against a threat like Al Qaeda — and the reason security almost always fails when tested by covert testers , innocent civilians and , occasionally , persons with intent .
At this moment , there are roughly 5000 commercial airliners in the skies above you .
There will be 28,000 flights today , and 840,000 in the next month — every month .
The U.S. fleet consists of some 6000 aircraft — almost all of which will be parked unattended tonight at a public airport .
We will carry almost 7 billion passengers this year , the number increasing to 10 billion by 2010 , barring an exogenous event like another 9/11 .
There is simply no deployable technology that has a prayer of keeping a motivated , prepared terrorist out of the system every time — even most times .
TSA misses more than 90 % of detectable weapons at passenger checkpoints in their own tests , and it is not their fault , because of the limitations of technology and the number of inspections they must conduct .
This does n’t count several classes of completely undetectable weapons like composite knives and liquid explosives .
What is TSA ’s fault is their abject failure to embrace more robust approaches than high visibility inspections , and their accommodations to the Air Transport Association ’s revenue interests at the expense of true security , while largely ignoring the recommendations of the front - line airline crews and air marshals who have no direct revenue agenda and are much more familiar with airline operations than are the bureaucrats ( remember government ignoring the front - line FBI agents who tried to warn them about 9/11 ? ) .
Deplorable amounts of money have been wasted on incomprehensible security strategies , while KISS [ Keep It Simple , Stupid ] methods proven to work have been ignored .
Aircraft on the ramp are just one example of this .
Immediately after 9/11 , the Administration deployed the National Guard to airport checkpoints to reassure the public , though the terrorists ’ objective was not the checkpoint , but the aircraft .
The Airline Pilots Security Alliance ( APSA ) called for putting National Guardsmen on airport ramps to monitor anyone around the aircraft , conduct random ID checks , and protect the aircraft from anyone putting suspicious cargo in the holds or cabin .
We also called for 100 % ground employee security screening , which , while flawed , provided some layer of prevention against minimum wage employees planting illicit weapons on commercial aircraft ; we also called for behavioral profiling of passengers at security checkpoints .
None of this was done , and the aircraft on the ramp were “ protected ” only by vigilant employees who had other , more primary responsibilities .
These aircraft were still freely accessible to many other employees who worked on the strength of a background check that said they had n’t done anything yet .
Today , RON ( remaining overnight ) aircraft are invariably unattended and unlocked all night .
Commercial aircraft typically do not have locks in their doors .
They are protected by roving airport police patrols and closed circuit cameras .
Neither methodology is very robust .
A skeleton crew of employees is also on duty who may see something suspicious , but most have gone home .
Jetway doors prevent access from the terminal but the exterior aircraft doors are unlocked to anyone who pushes a stairway up to them .
There have been numerous breaches of airport perimeters ( see www.secure-skies.org, How Safe Are You ? , Airport Perimeter Security ) , often by people who were n’t even trying .
At least one Al Qaeda sympathizer employed as a catering truck driver was arrested after driving onto airports for months , gathering intelligence .
It is certainly possible for a terrorist to jump the airport fence and walk to the airplanes , particularly at smaller airports , some with low fences and no or few cameras .
But the greatest threat to RON aircraft is that anyone with an airport swipe card can get on board unsupervised .
This includes third - party catering trucks coming in from outside the perimeter ( almost impossible to inspect in any meaningful way ) , subcontracted cleaning crews , and unskilled ramp employees .
There have been at least three “ rings ” of employees arrested since 9/11 : one for large - scale theft from passengers ’ bags , and two for putting illicit guns and drugs onboard aircraft .
The only reason these events did not result in a successful terror attack is because the bad guys were thieves and smugglers , not terrorists .
If those guns had been planted in the cabin of an aircraft , a terrorist team could have simply cleared security with their fellow passengers the next day , and armed themselves once they were onboard .
This threat is mitigated by the fact that pilots , flight attendants , and ramp agents now routinely inspect the aircraft before flight each day , and this provides a measure of security .
But it is not foolproof .
Since there is little time to do a thorough inspection prior to passenger boarding , well - concealed weapons can be missed .
A Maryland college student successfully planted hidden weapons in the lavatories of four or five Southwest Airlines jets several years ago .
He carried them right through the security checkpoint .
He was successful every time he tried .
And in some cases , the weapons were not discovered for weeks .
There is also a strong suspicion that weapons were “ pre-planted ” on some of the aircraft targeted on 9/11 .
From a terrorist ’s point of view , the downside of pre-planting weapons is that if they are found , the attack is thwarted literally before the plane gets off the ground , and warning is given to the entire air transport system .
But remember : the terrorists are also warned of the find , and do not have to risk compromise — they just stay home .
Conversely , if CNN is n’t broadcasting found weapons on airliners , the terrorists would know the operation has a good chance of succeeding , even before they arrive at the airport .
By the way , we constantly have to walk the line between sharing enough information to get fixes implemented , while not sharing so much it compromises our safety even more .
Everything I ’m writing is easily available to a motivated intelligence - gathering cell .
There are other problems I wo n’t discuss , because the information is not publicly available .
That does n’t mean it ’s not real .
What needs to happen across all segments of airline security is a philosophical change from trying to prevent an attack ( which does n’t work in a system this size ) to defending against one ( which does — a la Flight 93 ) .
Almost six years after 9/11 , it is inexcusable that — in an environment where TSA misses more than 90 % of weapons , RON aircraft are not secured , and ground employees are not screened — fewer than 2 % of our airliners have a team of armed pilots aboard , fewer than 5 % have air marshals , and the flight attendants have no mandatory tactical or behavioral assessment training .
$ 24 billion dollars later , we are not materially safer , except in the areas of intelligence that prevent an attack from getting to an airport .
Once at the airport , there is little reason to believe the attack wo n’t succeed .
If these airplanes were appropriately defended , it would matter less who got onboard and with what weapon .
We could then redeploy TSA assets to protecting RON aircraft , securing the ramps against suspicious persons , and randomly checking employee ID ’s , as well as implement 100 % cargo / baggage inspection and government funding for explosive - proof cargo compartments and missile defense .
It has taken six years , but TSA is now finally flirting with behavioral assessment training for screeners and random ( but not mandatory ) ground employee inspections .
The airlines complain screening all ground employees would significantly hinder airline operations .
They ’re right — it would .
As usual , though , it has taken far too long for even these fixes , and there ’s no action on the most meaningful improvements : dramatic expansion of the Federal Flight Deck Officer program , redeployment of air marshals on more specific , instead of random flights , and treating crews as critical assets , instead of as members of the general public , in terms of training and information sharing .
There is no question that we will get airline security right someday .
My only question is whether , at this point , we will get it right before the next attack .
After 9/11 , we were given the gift of time and of awareness .
I am very concerned we have squandered the gift of time — and there is little left before we are hit again — and we are losing the gift of awareness , as we truly forget what that morning was like .
There is no question in my mind , based on everything I hear in my position , that Al Qaeda is actively , aggressively preparing to target the United States again , and that commandeering an airliner is still the easiest , quickest method of possessing a weapon of mass destruction .
I am even more concerned that the next attack could be far worse than 9/11 , which , while devastating , would pale in comparison to other available targets .
Recalling World War II , the Japanese did n’t surrender after Hiroshima because they believed there was only one atom bomb .
It was only after another bomb hit Nagasaki — after we proved we could do it again — that their country collapsed .
Similarly , another successful 9/11 would devastate our country in ways we can’t even imagine — probably much more than the first attack , as we realize they can do it again despite our “ best ” efforts .
Government and airline management are taking an awful chance in promoting the appearance of security , instead of using , as President Bush promised , “ every resource available ” in this new world war .
I know I ’ve gotten pretty far afield of your topic , but I want to give you the sense that RON aircraft are just one small piece of a multilayered security system wherein every layer leaks like a sieve .
The problem is much , much bigger than any single element .
In the end , we should be starting with defending the smallest spaces — the cockpits and cargo compartments , and working outward to the limits of our resources ; instead of starting with the airport perimeter and working inward , ignoring the actual defense of those spaces that are actually the terrorist targets .
And we should be using the resources already in place to the greatest extent possible , instead of trying to bring new , untried methods into play , then waiting to find out they do n’t work nearly as well in reality as they do on paper .

I might never have found my way to Polyface Farm if Joel Salatin had n’t refused to FedEx me one of his chickens .
I ’d heard a lot about the quality of the meat raised on his “ beyond organic ” farm , and was eager to sample some .
Salatin and his family raise a half - dozen different species ( grass - fed beef , chickens , pigs , turkeys , and rabbits ) in an intricate rotation that has made his 550 hilly acres of pasture and woods in Virginia ’s Shenandoah Valley one of the most productive and sustainable small farms in America .
But when I telephoned Joel to ask him to send me a broiler , he said he could n’t do that .
I figured he meant he was n’t set up for shipping , so I offered to have an overnight delivery service come pick it up .
“ No , I do n’t think you understand .
I do n’t believe it ’s sustainable — ‘ organic , ’ if you will — to FedEx meat all around the country , ” Joel told me .
“ I ’m afraid if you want to try one of our chickens , you ’re going to have to drive down here to pick it up . ”
This man was serious .
He went on to explain that Polyface does not ship long distance , does not sell to supermarkets , and does not wholesale its food .
All of the meat and eggs that Polyface produces is eaten within a few dozen miles or , at the most , half a day ’s drive of the farm — within the farm ’s “ foodshed . ”
At first I assumed Joel ’s motive for keeping his food chain so short was strictly environmental — to save on the prodigious quantities of fossil fuel Americans burn moving their food around the country and , increasingly today , the world .
( The typical fruit or vegetable on an American ’s plate travels some 1,500 miles to get there , and is frequently better traveled and more worldly than its eater . )
But after taking Joel up on his offer to drive down to Swoope , Virginia , to pick up a chicken , I picked up a great deal more — about the renaissance of local food systems , and the values they support , values that go far beyond the ones a food buyer supports when he or she buys organic in the supermarket .
It turns out that Joel Salatin , and the local food movement he ’s become an influential part of , is out to save a whole lot more than energy .
In Joel ’s view , the reformation of our food economy begins with people going to the trouble and expense of buying directly from farmers they know — “ relationship marketing , ” the approach he urges in his recent book , Holy Cows and Hog Heaven : The Food Buyer ’s Guide to Farm Friendly Food .
Joel believes that the only meaningful guarantee of integrity is when buyers and sellers can look one another in the eye , something few of us ever take the trouble to do .
“ Do n’t you find it odd that people will put more work into choosing their mechanic or house contractor than they will into choosing the person who grows their food ? ”
Joel , who describes himself as a “ Christian - libertarian - environmentalist - lunatic farmer , ” speaks of his farming as his “ ministry , ” and certainly his 1,000 or so regular customers hear plenty of preaching .
Each spring he sends out a long , feisty , single - spaced letter that could convince even a fast - food junkie that buying a pastured broiler from Polyface Farm qualifies as an act of social , environmental , nutritional , and political redemption .
“ Greetings from the non -bar code people , ” began one recent missive , before launching into a high - flying jeremiad against our disconnected “ multi-national global corporate techno - glitzy food system ” with its “ industrial fecal factory concentration camp farms . ”
( The dangerous pileup of modifiers is a hallmark of Joel ’s rhetorical style . )
Like any good jeremiad , this one eventually transits from despair to hope , noting that the “ yearning in the human soul to smell a flower , pet a pig and enjoy food with a face is stronger now than anytime in history , ” before moving into a matter - of - fact discussion of this year ’s prices and the paramount importance of sending in your order blanks and showing up to collect your chickens on time .
I met several of Polyface ’s parishioners on a Thursday in June as they came to collect the fresh chickens they ’d reserved .
It was a remarkably diverse group of people : a schoolteacher , several retirees , a young mom with her towheaded twins , a mechanic , an opera singer , a furniture maker , a woman who worked in a metal fabrication plant in Staunton .
They were paying a premium over supermarket prices for Polyface food , and in many cases driving more than an hour over a daunting ( though gorgeous ) tangle of county roads to come get it .
But no one would ever mistake these people for the well - heeled , urban foodies generally thought to comprise the market for organic or artisanal food .
There was plenty of polyester in this crowd and a lot more Chevrolets than Volvos in the parking lot .
So what exactly had they come all the way out here to the farm to buy ?
Here are some of the comments I collected :
“ This is chicken as I remember it from my childhood .
It actually tastes like chicken . ”
“ I just do n’t trust the food in the supermarket anymore . ”
“ These eggs just jump up and slap you in the face ! ”
“ You ’re not going to find fresher chickens anywhere . ”
“ All this meat comes from happy animals — I know because I ’ve seen them .
And the pork tenderloin is to die for ! ”
“ I drive 150 miles one way to get clean meat for my family . ”
“ It ’s very simple : I trust the Salatins more than I trust Wal - Mart .
And I like the idea of keeping my money right here in town . ”
I was hearing , in other words , the same stew of food fears and food pleasures ( and food memories ) that has driven the growth of the organic food industry over the past 20 years — that , and the satisfaction many Polyface customers clearly take in spending a little time on a farm , porch - chatting with the Salatins , and taking a beautiful drive in the country to get here .
For some people , reconnecting with the source of their food is a powerful idea .
For the farmer , these on - farm sales allow him to recapture the 92 cents of a consumer ’s food dollar that now typically winds up in the pockets of processors , middlemen , and retailers .
I asked Joel how he answers the charge that because food like his is more expensive , it is inherently elitist .
“ I do n’t accept the premise , ” he replied .
“ First off , those were n’t any ‘ elitists ’ you met on the farm this morning .
We sell to all kinds of people .
Second , whenever I hear people say clean food is expensive , I tell them it ’s actually the cheapest food you can buy .
That always gets their attention .
Then I explain that , with our food , all of the costs are figured into the price .
Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution , of antibiotic resistance , of food - borne illnesses , of crop subsidies , of subsidized oil and water — of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap .
No thinking person will tell you they do n’t care about all that .
I tell them the choice is simple :
You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food . ”
As it is , artisanal producers like Joel compete on quality , which , oddly enough , is still a somewhat novel idea when it comes to food .
“ When someone drives up to the farm in a BMW and asks me why our eggs cost more , well , first I try not to get mad , ” said Joel .
“ Frankly , any city person who does n’t think I deserve a white - collar salary as a farmer does n’t deserve my special food .
Let them eat E. coli .
But I do n’t say that .
Instead I take him outside and point at his car .
‘ Sir , you clearly understand quality and are willing to pay for it .
Well , food is no different :
You get what you pay for . ’
“ Why is it that we exempt food , of all things , from that rule ?
Industrial agriculture , because it depends on standardization , has bombarded us with the message that all pork is pork , all chicken is chicken , eggs eggs , even though we all know that ca n’t really be true .
But it ’s downright un -American to suggest that one egg might be nutritionally superior to another . ”
Joel recited the slogan of his local supermarket chain : “ ‘ We pile it high and sell it cheap . ’
What other business would ever sell its products that way ? ”
When you think about it , it is odd that something as important to our health and general well - being as food is so often sold strictly on the basis of price .
Look at any supermarket ad in the newspaper and all you will find in it are quantities — pounds and dollars ; qualities of any kind are nowhere to be found .
The value of relationship marketing is that it allows many kinds of information besides price to travel up and down the food chain : stories as well as numbers , qualities as well as quantities , values rather than “ value . ”
And as soon as that happens , people begin to make different kinds of buying decisions , motivated by criteria other than price .
But instead of stories about how it was produced accompanying our food , we get bar codes — as illegible as the industrial food chain itself , and a fair symbol of its almost total opacity .
Much of our food system depends on our not knowing much about it , beyond the price disclosed by the checkout scanner ; cheapness and ignorance are mutually reinforcing .
And it ’s a short way from not knowing who ’s at the other end of your food chain to not caring — to the carelessness of both producers and consumers that characterizes our economy today .
Of course , the global economy could n’t very well function without this wall of ignorance and the indifference it breeds .
This is why the American food industry and its international counterparts fight to keep their products from telling even the simplest stories — “ dolphin safe , ” “ humanely slaughtered , ” etc. — about how they were produced .
The more knowledge people have about the way their food is produced , the more likely it is that their values — and not just “ value ” — will inform their purchasing decisions .
TO TALK TO THE CUSTOMERS and farmers working together in Joel Salatin ’s corner of the country to rebuild a local food chain is to appreciate it is a movement and not merely a market .
Or rather it is a novel hybrid , a market - as - movement for at its heart is a new conception of what it means to be a “ consumer ” — an attempt to redeem that ugly word , with its dismal colorings of selfishness and subtraction .
Many of the Polyface customers I met ( though by no means all of them ) had come to see their decision to buy a chicken from a local farmer rather than from Wal - Mart as a kind of civic act , even a form of protest .
A protest of what exactly is harder to pin down , and each person might put it a little differently , but the customers I met at Polyface had gone to some trouble and expense to “ opt out ” — of the supermarket , of the fast - food nation , and , standing behind that , a globalized industrial agriculture .
Their talk of distrusting Wal - Mart , resenting the abuse of animals in farm factories , insisting on knowing who was growing their food , and wanting to keep their food dollars in town — all this suggested that for many of these people spending a little more for a dozen eggs was a decision inflected by a politics , however tentative or inchoate .
“ Opting out ” is a key term for Joel , who believes that it would be a fatal mistake to “ try to sell a connected , holistic , ensouled product through a Western , reductionist , Wall Street sales scheme ” — by which ( I think ) he means selling to big organic supermarkets like Whole Foods .
As far as Joel is concerned , there is n’t a world of difference between Whole Foods and Wal - Mart .
Both are part of an increasingly globalized economy that turns any food it touches into a commodity , reaching its tentacles wherever in the world a food can be produced most cheaply and then transporting it wherever it can be sold most dearly .
Shortly before I traveled to Virginia , I ’d reread an essay by Wendell Berry in which he argued that reversing the damage done to local economies and the land by the juggernaut of world trade would take nothing less than “ a revolt of local small producers and local consumers against the global industrialism of the corporations . ”
He detected the beginnings of such a rebellion in the rise of local food systems and the growing market “ for good , fresh , trustworthy food , food from producers known and trusted by consumers . ”
Which , as he points out , “ cannot be produced by a global corporation . ”
Berry would have me believe that what I was seeing in the Polyface salesroom represented a local uprising in a gathering worldwide rebellion against what he calls “ the total economy . ”
Why should food , of all things , be the linchpin of that rebellion ?
Perhaps because food is a powerful metaphor for a great many of the values to which people feel globalization poses a threat , including the distinctiveness of local cultures and identities , the survival of local landscapes , and biodiversity .
When José Bové , the French Roquefort farmer and anti-globalization activist , wanted to make his stand against globalization , he used his tractor to smash not a bank or insurance company but a McDonald’s .
Indeed , the most powerful protests against globalization to date have revolved around food : I ’m thinking of the movement against genetically modified crops , the campaign against patented seeds in India ( which a few years ago brought as many as half a million Indians into the streets to protest World Trade Organization intellectual property rules ) , and Slow Food , the Italian - born international move - ment that seeks to defend traditional food cultures against the global tide of homogenization .
Even for people who find the logic of globalization otherwise compelling , the globalization of food often stops them short .
Treating food as a commodity like any other simply does n’t square with their beliefs or experience .
But that is precisely where the logic of globalization leads :
Once the last barrier to free trade comes down , and the last program of government support for farmers ends , our food will come from wherever in the world it can be produced most cheaply .
The iron law of competitive advantage dictates that if another country can grow something more efficiently — whether because its land or labor is cheaper or its environmental laws more lax — we will no longer grow it here .
What ’s more , under the global economic dispensation , this is an outcome to be wished for , since it will free our land for more productive uses — more houses , say .
Since land in the United States is relatively expensive , and our tolerance for agricultural pollution and animal cruelty is rapidly wearing thin , in the future all our food may come from elsewhere , as well it should .
This argument has been made by , among others , economist Steven C. Blank , in a book rather bloodlessly titled The End of Agriculture in the American Portfolio .
And why should a nation produce its own food when others can produce it more cheaply ?
A dozen reasons leap to mind , but most of them the Steven Blanks of the world — and they are legion — are quick to dismiss as sentimental .
I ’m thinking of the sense of security that comes from knowing your community , or country , can feed itself ; the beauty of an agricultural landscape ; the outlook and kinds of local knowledge the presence of farmers brings to a community ; the satisfactions of buying food from a farmer you know rather than the supermarket ; the locally inflected flavor of a raw - milk cheese or honey .
All those things — all those pastoral values — free trade pro-poses to sacrifice in the name of efficiency and economic growth .
Though you do begin to wonder who is truly the “ realist ” in this debate , and who the romantic .
We live , as Berry has written , in an era of “ sentimental economics , ” since the promise of global capitalism , much like the promise of communism before it , ultimately depends on an act of faith : that if we permit the destruction of certain things we value here and now , we will achieve a greater happiness and prosperity at some unspecified future date .
As Lenin reputedly put it , in a sentiment the WTO endorses in its rulings every day , you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet .
Perhaps it is no accident that sentimental communism foundered precisely on the issue of food .
The Soviets sacrificed millions of small farms and farmers to the dream of a collectivized industrial agriculture that never managed to do what a food system has to do : feed the nation .
By the time of its collapse , more than half of the food consumed in the Soviet Union was being produced by small farmers and home gardeners operating without official sanction on private plots tucked away in the overlooked corners and cracks of the crumbling Soviet monolith .
George Naylor , an outspoken Iowa corn and soybean farmer who heads up the National Family Farm Coalition , has likened the rise of alternative food chains in America to “ the last days of Soviet agriculture .
The centralized food system was n’t serving the people ’s needs , so they went around it .
The rise of farmer ’s markets and CSAs [ community supported agriculture , the name for farms that offer weekly boxes of produce on a subscription basis ] is sending the same signal today . ”
Of course , the problems of our food system are very different — if anything , it produces too much food , not too little , or too much of the wrong food .
But there ’s no question that it is failing many consumers and producers , who together are finding creative ways around it .
So much about life in a global economy feels as though it has passed beyond the individual ’s control — what happens to our jobs , to the prices at the gas station , to the votes in the legislature .
But somehow food still feels a little different .
We can still decide , every day , what we ’re going to put into our bodies , what sort of food chain we want to participate in .
We can , in other words , reject the industrial omelet on offer and decide to eat another .
This might not sound like a big deal , but it could be the beginnings of one .
Already the desire on the part of consumers to put something different in their bodies has created a $ 14 billion market in organic food in the United States .
That marketplace was built by consumers and farmers working informally together outside the system , with exactly no help from the government .
The total economy , astounding in its ability to absorb every challenge , is well on its way to transforming organic food from a reform movement into an industry — another flavor in the global supermarket .
It took capitalism less than a quarter century to turn even something as ephemeral as bagged salads of cut and washed organic mesclun , of all things , into a cheap international commodity retailed in a new organic supermarket .
Whether this is a good or bad thing , people will disagree ; probably it ’s a little of both .
Joel Salatin and his customers want to be somewhere that juggernaut ca n’t go , and it may be that by elevating local above organic , they have found exactly that place .
By definition , local is a hard thing to sell in a global marketplace .
Local food , as opposed to organic , implies a new economy as well as a new agriculture — new social and economic relationships as well as new ecological ones .
It ’s a lot more complicated .
Of course , just because food is local does n’t necessarily mean it will be organic or even sustainable .
There ’s nothing to stop a local farm from using chemicals or abusing animals — except the gaze or good word of its customers .
Instead of looking at labels , the local food customer will look at the farm for himself , or look the farmer in the eye and ask him about how he grows his crops or treats his animals .
That said , there are good reasons to think a genuinely local agriculture will tend to be a more sustainable agriculture .
For one thing , it is much less likely to rely on monoculture , the original sin from which almost every other problem of our food system flows .
A farmer dependent on a local market will , perforce , need to grow a wide variety of things , rather than specialize in the one or two plants or animals that the national market ( organic or otherwise ) would ask from him .
The supermarket wants all its lettuce from the Central Valley , all its apples from Washington state , and all its corn from Iowa .
( At least until the day it decides it wants all its corn from Argentina , all its apples from China , and all its lettuce from Mexico . )
People in Iowa can eat only so much corn and soybeans themselves .
So when Iowans decide to eat locally , rather than from the supermarket , their farmers will quickly learn to grow a few other things besides .
And when they do , they ’ll probably find they can give up most of their fertilizers and pesticides , since a diversified farm will produce much of its own fertility and its own pest control .
Shopping in the Organic Supermarket underwrites important values on the farm ; shopping locally underwrites a whole set of other values as well .
Farms produce a lot more than food ; they also produce a kind of landscape and kind of community .
Whether Polyface ’s customers spend their food dollars here in Swoope or in the Whole Foods in Charlottesville will have a large bearing on whether this lovely valley — this undulating checkerboard of fields and forests — will endure , or whether the total economy will find a “ higher use ” for it .
“ Eat your view ! ” is a bumper sticker often seen in Europe these days ; as it implies , the decision to eat locally is an act of land conservation as well , one that is probably a lot more effective ( and sustainable ) than writing checks to environmental organizations .
“ Eat your view ! ” takes work , however .
To participate in a local food economy requires considerably more effort than shopping at the Whole Foods .
You wo n’t find anything microwavable at the farmer ’s market or in your weekly box of organic produce from the CSA , and you wo n’t find a tomato in December .
The local food shopper will need to put some work into sourcing his own food — learning who grows the best lamb in his area , or the best sweet corn .
And then he will have to become reacquainted with his kitchen .
Much of the appeal of the industrial food chain is its convenience ; it offers busy people a way to delegate their cooking ( and food preservation ) to others .
At the other end of the industrial food chain that begins in a cornfield in Iowa sits an industrial eater at a table .
( Or , increasingly , in a car . )
The achievement of the industrial food system over the past half - century has been to transform most of us into precisely that creature .
All of which is to say that a successful local food economy implies not only a new kind of food producer but a new kind of eater — one who regards finding , preparing , and preserving food as one of the pleasures of life rather than a chore .
One whose sense of taste has ruined him for a Big Mac , and whose sense of place has ruined him for shopping for groceries at Wal - Mart .
This is the consumer who understands — or remembers — that , in Wendell Berry ’s memorable phrase , “ eating is an agricultural act . ”
He might have added it ’s a political act as well .
ON MY LAST DAY ON THE FARM , a soft June Friday afternoon , Joel and I sat talking at a picnic table behind the house while a steady stream of customers dropped by to pick up their chickens .
I asked him if he believed the industrial food chain would ever be overturned by an informal , improvised movement made up of farmer ’s markets , box schemes , metropolitan buying clubs , Slow Foodies , and artisanal meat - processing plants .
Even if you count the Organic Supermarket , the entire market for all alternative foods remains but a flea on the colossus of the industrial food economy , with its numberless fast - food outlets and supermarkets backed by infinite horizons of corn and soybeans .
“ We do n’t have to beat them , ” Joel patiently explained .
“ I ’m not even sure we should try .
We do n’t need a law against McDonald ’s or a law against slaughterhouse abuse — we ask for too much salvation by legislation .
All we need to do is empower individuals with the right philosophy and the right information to opt out en masse .
“ And make no mistake : it ’s happening .
The mainstream is splitting into smaller and smaller groups of like - minded people .
It ’s a little like Luther nailing his 95 theses up at Wittenberg .
Back then it was the printing press that allowed the Protestants to break off and form their own communities ; now it ’s the Internet , splintering us into tribes that want to go their own way . ”
Of course !
Joel saw himself as more of a Luther than a Lenin ; the goal was n’t to blow up the Church but simply to step around it .
Protestantism also comes in many denominations , as I suspect will the future of food .
Deciding whether that future should more closely resemble Joel ’s radically local vision or Whole Foods ’ industrial organic matters less than assuring that thriving alternatives exist ; feeding the cities may require a different sort of food chain than feeding the countryside .
We may need a great many different alternative food chains , organic and local , biodynamic and Slow , and others yet undreamed of .
As in the fields , nature may provide the best model for the marketplace , and nature never puts all her eggs in one basket .
The great virtue of a diversified food economy , like a diverse pasture or farm , is its ability to withstand any shock .
The important thing is that there be many food chains , so that when any one of them fails — when the oil runs out , when mad cow or other food - borne diseases become epidemic , when the pesticides no longer work , when drought strikes and plagues come and soils blow away — we ’ll still have a way to feed ourselves .
It is because some of those failures are already in view that the salesroom at Polyface Farm is buzzing with activity this afternoon , and why farmer ’s markets in towns and cities all across America are buzzing this afternoon too .
“ An alternative food system is rising up on the margins , ” Joel continued .
“ One day Frank Perdue and Don Tyson are going to wake up and find that their world has changed .
It wo n’t happen overnight , but it will happen , just as it did for those Catholic priests who came to church one Sunday morning only to find that , my goodness , there are n’t as many people in the pews today .
Where in the world has everybody gone ? ”
Iraqi team wins Asian Cup , captain condemns US occupation
By Patrick Martin
31 July 2007
The 1 - 0 victory by the Iraqi soccer team in Sunday ’s Asian Cup featured a brilliant goal on a header by Younis Mahmoud , the team ’s 24 - year - old captain .
This was followed by an “ own goal ” for the Bush administration and its Iraqi stooge regime , which had hoped to reap a propaganda windfall from the event .
Instead , Mahmoud told a worldwide television audience that he dared not return to his homeland because of the conditions created by the US occupation .
“ I want America to go out , ” he said .
“ Today , tomorrow , or the day after tomorrow , but out .
I wish the American people did n’t invade Iraq and hopefully it will be over soon . ”
Mahmoud said he would return to the Persian Gulf sheikdom of Qatar , where he plays on a professional team .
“ I do n’t want the Iraqi people to be angry with me , ” he said .
But “ if I go back with the team , anybody could kill me or try to hurt me . ”
He added , “ One of my closest friends , they came to arrest him , and for one year neither me nor his family knew where he is . ”
The Iraqi team ’s unexpected progress through the quadrennial tournament was greeted with enthusiasm throughout the country , and many saw the national team ’s effort , uniting players of all ethnic and religious backgrounds , as a welcome rebuff to the increasingly vicious sectarian conflict at home .
The winning goal came on a corner kick by Hawar Mohammed , a Kurd , headed into the net by Mahmoud , a Sunni Turkoman from Kirkuk ( Ironically , Kurdish nationalist parties are campaigning for Kirkuk , and its nearby oilfields , to be transferred to the control of the Kurdish regional government , a demand adamantly opposed by Turkoman and Arab groups , both Sunni and Shiite ) .
Goalkeeper Noor Sabri Abbas , a Shiite , played a central role in the Iraqi team ’s progress through the field , posting four consecutive shutouts , including the semi-final victory over South Korea where he blocked two shots in the final shootout after a regulation 0 - 0 tie , resulting in a 4 - 3 victory for the Iraqi team .
During the tournament , Sabri ’s brother - in - law was killed in a bombing , and two other team members lost relatives during the same period .
Other incidents in the month - long tournament reflected the terrible conditions in the occupied and war - torn country .
Mahmoud , the captain and final - winning star , was detained at the airport in Bangkok , Thailand for 12 hours and nearly missed the opening game .
The entire team wore black armbands for the final against Saudi Arabia to honor the memory of the dozens of fans killed by two car bombs during celebrations of the semi-final victory .
The political leaders of the US - backed puppet government in Baghdad sought to associate themselves with the national team .
Before the final , Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki promised each member of the team a $ 10,000 bonus .
State television broadcasts described al - Maliki making congratulatory phone calls to the team , at a time when the television pictures showed all the players celebrating out on the field .
President Jalal Talabani pledged an additional $ 10,000 to each player and $ 20,000 to Mahmoud after the victory .
But Talabani admitted that it might not even be possible to stage a welcome - home celebration in the Iraqi capital because of security considerations .
“ We will receive them in Baghdad airport .
If that ’s not possible , Irbil or Sulaymaniya , ” he said , referring to the main cities in the Kurdish region .
The American media was geared up for an orgy of propaganda , seeking to use the soccer victory as a metaphor for a military victory by the US and puppet forces over the anti-occupation resistance .
Mahmoud ’s forthright opposition to the occupation — a sentiment shared by the overwhelming majority of the Iraqi population — did not fit that script , so it was relegated to a near - footnote in newspaper reports by the Washington Post and New York Times , and omitted entirely in broadcast reports by NBC , ABC , CBS and Fox .
Only
Fox even reported Mahmoud ’s comments on its web site , in an AP story .
Diet Coke is 99 % Water ( And That Is Now a Good Thing )
Back in the day , when people noted that Diet Coke was 99 % water , it was an insult .
The point was that water was free , and Diet Coke was just free water plus a little bit of artificial this and that — so you would have to be a fool to pay so much for it .
Of course , times have changed .
Bottled water now generates an estimated $ 50 billion in sales each year , with that number growing rapidly .
According to this CBS News report , which puts soda revenues at $ 68 billion a year and stagnant , bottled water is now as big a business as soda .
All of which explains the new print ad I saw for Diet Coke , which was simply a picture of a can of Diet Coke and the words “ 99 Percent Water . ”
The implication is that if Diet Coke and water are almost the same thing , but Diet Coke tastes better , you might as well drink Diet Coke .
Which is a pretty sensible point of view , as long as the 1 % that is not water is n’t hurting you .
Still , imagine if an ad agency in the 1980s proposed such a slogan for Diet Coke .
They would have been laughed out of the building , and for good reason .
What consumers are willing to pay for a good depends on at least two things ( although this is not the way economists usually talk about how demand is determined ) .
The first is how much utility or enjoyment they get from the good .
The second is how much it costs to make the good — consumers do n’t like big markups , even if they enjoy consuming the good .
So , in a world where free water is the benchmark , if you make Diet Coke , you want to hide the fact that it is mostly water with a few cheap extras mixed in .
On the other hand , when water is priced the same as soda , that part of the equation falls away .
The emphasis can instead move to the fact that a lot of people strongly prefer the flavor of Diet Coke to that of water .
I do n’t know whether this ad campaign will work , but it definitely shows cultural — not to mention economic — insight .
GOP senator criticizes Iraq war in emotional speech WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In an emotional speech on the Senate floor Thursday night , Sen Gordon Smith , a moderate Republican from Oregon who has been a supporter of the war in Iraq , said the U.S. military 's " tactics have failed " and he " cannot support that anymore . "
Smith said he is at , " the end of my rope when it comes to supporting a policy that has our soldiers patrolling the same streets in the same way , being blown up the same bombs , day after day .
" That is absurd , " he said .
" It may even be criminal . "
Smith said he has tried to quietly support President Bush during the course of the war -- and does n't believe the president intentionally lied to get the U.S. into the war -- but now recognizes , " we have paid a price in blood and treasure that is beyond calculation " for a war waged due to bad intelligence .
Moved this week by the findings of the Iraq Study Group , Smith said he needed to " speak from my heart .
" I , for one , am tired of paying the price of 10 or more of our troops dying a day .
So let 's cut and run or cut and walk , but let us fight the way on terror more intelligently that we have because we have fought this war in a very lamentable way , " he said .
-- From CNN Congressional Producer Ted Barrett
Is it just me , or has Feedster been completely useless for over 6 months now ?
I have no idea if it's related to the recent departure of Scott Rafer ( former CEO ) and Scott Johnson ( former co-founder ) , but I 'm amazed at how bad it is .
And I should know .
I 've been a Feedster user from the first day it was announced , back when it was called " Roogle . "
Ever since then , I 've had a few Feedster keyword search subscriptions in my aggregator so I 'd know when bloggers wrote about something I 'm interested in : my name , my company , my favorite technology , etc .
And for quite a while now the results have been abysmal .
They 've often been broken chunks of HTML from seemingly random blog posts that are months ( or years ! ) old , and more than half are content scraping spam blogs .
About the only thing it 's been useful for is finding the latest spam blogs to begin stealing my content .
Technorati used to have that distinction but they 've done an excellent job of cleaning up the spam .
Over a year ago a friend of mine got a job at Feedster .
( I had introduced him to Scott . )
Not long after that , we were driving up to San Francisco when I asked him a question .
It went something like this :
What do you think Feedster 's window of opportunity is ?
6 months ?
12 ? 18 ?
They 're clearly in a race to establish themselves in the market , carve out their space , and compete with Technorati before the Big Three build blog / rss search .
He had n't really thought about it .
I encouraged him to do so mainly because I think it 's easy to get caught up in the fun and excitement of building while things are actually crumbling around you and your company is steadily loosing ground .
He wisely left Feedster in the middle of last year .
A lot of folks have been making predictions for 2006 .
Here is the first of mine : by the end of 2006 , Feedster will be dead and buried .
Technorati , on the other hand , will be just fine .

How Much does Solar Power Cost ?
This will depend on many factors including :
Your location – your government rebate amount will depend on where you live ( among other things )
System size –
This is measured in kW and starts from 1.5kW
Solar Panel Quality –
You can get expensive ( overrated in my opinion ) German made solar panels , or like 95 % of people getting Solar Power in Australia , use China made panels .
Solar Inverter Quality –
There are many brands on the market , make sure you visit some forums like Whirlpool where people are talking about their experiences with certain brands ( of inverter OR solar panels )
Your installer – we have seen it all when it comes to solar power quotes , and it ’s quite often that one installer can over - quote by $ Thousands while using the same level of quality of inverter and panels as everyone else .
So ensure you get 3 quotes from 3 Quick Quotes and make the Installers compete for your business .
On average a 1.5 kW system fully installed SHOULD cost $ 2,000 - $ 3,000 ( after the rebate has been factored in ) .
How Much will I Save on my Electricity Bills ?
This will depend on where you live ( i.e. the amount of sunlight there ) and also the system size you have .
As a general rule a 1.5 kW system installed in NSW can save you $ 100 - $ 150 per Quarter on your electricity bills .
Therefore Solar is definitely a worthwhile investment .
As you go up in system size , the savings will also go up .
Is there a Government Rebate for Solar and if so How Much ?
Yes there is a solar power rebate , it is known as the Solar credits scheme ( among other names ) and involves the signing over of Small - scale Technology Certificates ( STCs ) to YOU the home owner or in most cases the installer of your system , who usually prices in the rebate into the supply and install of your system .
The amount of the Government rebate varies through the Country depending in which Zone you reside ( there is 4 Zones ) .
But as mentioned previously your Solar Installer should explain the rebate and they will price the rebate into your quote .
How Many Solar Panels will I need on My Roof ?
One of the deterrents of people getting Solar Electricity is the panels that have to go on top of your house ’s roof , so how many panels do you need on your roof ?
This depends on the Watts in each panel and the Size your system – Example :
If you are getting a 1.5 kW system and the Panels that your solar power company uses are 200W , then you will need 8 panels – because 8 x 220W = 1,600W .
So the more wattage your panels have – the less you will need on your roof .
What Steps Do I need to Take to Get Solar Energy ?
1 ) Choose your system size – the minimum system size is 1.5 kW – this will save you $ 100 - $ 200 per quarter on your Electricity bills .
Other options are 2 kW , 3 kW and so on – you can even get 10kW .
But a 5 kW would probably be enough for most family homes to completely cover their Electricity bills ( not many people get 5 kW systems as they cost $ 10 k ++ ) .
2 ) Use this website to get 3 quick quotes from local providers in your area .
3 ) Get it Installed – Once you sign up with a local installer , the installer will install two main components – photovoltaic panels on your roof and an Inverter on the side of your house .
Once the system is installed you will then pay the installer and sign over the STC credits ( rebate ) to them .
4 ) Grid Connection –
You will now need to get your system connected to the grid – this need
5 ) Electricity Company – Notify your electricity supplier of the connection of your new system .

This post is about executing Javascript inside the JVM without using a browser .
Besides the fact that people are talking about running Javascript on the server again , and again ) , here ’s why my colleagues and I used it on a recent project :
We have some logic that needs to run on the server and on the client , depending on when the application applies it .
There is like an incredibly complex form validation involed .
Think of a loan application , for example .
Zillions of rules like “ at least five years at current location or at most three locations in ten years or owns current location for at least one year . ”
The whole thing forms a big logical expression that needs to be evaluated in such a way that we can report which pieces are missing or do not meet requirements ( Declined because income is insufficient and does not state purpose of loan ) .
There are a couple of ways to handle this .
One is to submit the form back to the server for validation .
Another is to write everything in Java , but use a sophisticated tool to render the Java into Javascript .
Naturally , our team chose a third option , The Rails Way ( available for pre-order ) .
We have a Domain - Specific Language for describing the rules .
Business users use the DSL , and another tool writes code from that .
We could , in theory , write Java methods for the server and write Javascript for the client .
We chose to start with Javascript , and we ’ll write Java for the server if running Javascript on the server turns out to beslow .
In the mean time , we decided that having some Java make a simple function call to a Javascript function and process a simple result was a reasonable first step .
As a side benefit , we run all our server - side Javascript unit tests in Java test suites alongside our Java unit tests .
And after some fiddling around , we got Javascript working on the JVM .
My bet is that you can get it working too , and it wo n’t take more than fifteen minutes .
Care to try it ?
You ’ll need JDK 1.5 or 1.6 from Sun .
If you already have this , move on to step one .
Still reading ?
You ’ll need to do a big install before we go further .
Go to the downloads page and download the latest thing they have on offer with the words “ JDK ” in it .
You wo n’t need JEE ( the framework formerly known as J2EE ) for this exercise , but if you know what it is you know enough to decide whether to download it .
Right now , you want .
Go get it and suffer through the installation process .
Java6 has a new framework for running “ scripting ” languages , and it ’s built into Java6 .
We ’re not going to use it today , just because some of you may still need to make stuff work with JDK 1.5 in production .
Instead , we ’re going to go get the Jakarta Bean Scripting Framework ( BSF ) .
You can download it here .
We ’ll needYMMV , but I found that I could n’t get BSF working without including the Jakarta Commons - Logging jar .
So if you do n’t have this floating around , go here and download it .
I experimented , and I could ignore everything except .
If that was missing , BSF kakked .
Since we ’re going to run Javascript , we need an interpreter .
Rhino to the rescue .
Download it .
We ’ll needReady to code ?
Let ’s start with a directory for all of our stuff .
Call it .
For the sake of keeping thing simple , set up the sub - structure as follows :
You may be using a fancy IDE , you may be using a text editor and have to graft your classpaths together with chicken wire .
The important thing is that your classpath , besides including all of Java ’s required stuff , and your own Java classes , also includesandWe ’ll put all three in thesubdirectory :
Let ’s write some Java : create the following subdirectories and put a file calledin it :
Let ’s give it some code : Run your new Java application .
Did you see that ?
It interpreted some Javascript in the JVM without a browser .
Check your watch .
Did you need more than a quarter of an hour ?
I did n’t think so .
You can try more ambitious code : I did n’t find an easy way to get Javascript files to include other Javascript files .
This is n’t the worst thing in the world , but you certainly do n’t want to write anything substantial inside of Java strings .
So try experimenting with reading javascript files right off the classpath .
I created a subdirectory calledAnd you can read Javascript into your strings or Stringbuffers with some fairly simple code , thanks to a utility built into BSF : That reads some script into a string .
You can then prepend it to whatever you want to evaluate .
Note that if you want to set up some sort of simple checking to make sure that you do n’t “ include ” the same file twice , you will need to write yourself a little framework for that , perhaps using ato keep track of what you ’ve already loaded .
This is nice , and with a little work you could make a program that reads paths to Javascript files off the commend line and executes them .
But to make things really interesting , you want to find a way to get Java data into your JavaScript and do something useful with the results , not just print it as a String .
BSF provides a way to inject objects into the scripting language ’s environment , so you could use that facility .
When writing automated unit tests for that particular project , I chose a simpler route : I serialized the data into JSON and used that to call a Javascript function directly via BSF : This is a really bad idea if your JSON is handed you from an insecure source , such as a public web page calling you back via , but if you trust your source , this works wonderfully .
Now what do you do with the result ?
If you are generating something esoteric like a Javascript function , I have no idea .
In my own case , I return all values as simple trees of Hashes ( Javascript objects without any special methods ) and Arrays .
I convert those into Java trees of Maps and Arrays : Check your watch .
Are you still under fifteen minutes ?
Great !

Never , under any circumstances , take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night .
If you had to identify , in one word , the reason why the human race has not achieved , and never will achieve , its full potential , that word would be “ meetings . ”
There is a very fine line between “ hobby ” and “ mental illness . ”
People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them .
You should not confuse your career with your life .
Nobody cares if you ca n’t dance well .
Just get up and dance .
Never lick a steak knife .
The most destructive force in the universe is gossip .
You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight savings time .
You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that you think she ’s pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment .
There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a big deal about your birthday .
That time is age eleven .
The one thing that unites all human beings , regardless of age , gender , religion , economic status or ethnic background , is that , deep down inside , we ALL believe that we are above - average drivers .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Upheaval in the Middle East and Islamic civilization could cause another world war , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was quoted as saying in an Austrian newspaper interview published on Monday .
The U.S. ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , passes near the children of Mala Krusa , 70 km ( 43 miles ) southwest of the capital Pristina , April 28 , 2007 .
Upheaval in the Middle East and Islamic civilization could cause another world war , Khalilzad was quoted as saying in an Austrian newspaper interview published on Monday .
REUTERS / Hazir Reka
Zalmay Khalilzad told the daily Die Presse the Middle East was now so disordered that it had the potential to inflame the world as Europe did during the first half of the 20th century .
“ The ( Middle East ) is going through a very difficult transformation phase .
That has strengthened extremism and creates a breeding ground for terrorism , ” he said in remarks translated by Reuters into English from the published German .
“ Europe was just as dysfunctional for a while .
And some of its wars became world wars .
Now the problems of the Middle East and Islamic civilization have the same potential to engulf the world , ” he was quoted as saying .
Khalilzad , interviewed by Die Presse while attending a foreign policy seminar in the Austrian Alps , said the Islamic world would eventually join the international mainstream but this would take some time .
“ They started late .
They do n’t have a consensus on their concept .
Some believe they should return to the time ( 6th - 7th century ) of the Prophet Mohammad , ” he was quoted as saying .
“ It may take decades before some understand that they can remain Muslims and simultaneously join the modern world . ”
Khalilzad was also quoted as saying Iraq would need foreign forces for security for a long time to come .
“ Iraq will not be in a position to stand on its own feet for a longer period , ” he said in the interview .
Asked whether that could be 10 - 20 years , he said : “ Yes , indeed , it could last that long .
What form the help takes will depend a lot on the Iraqis .
Up to now there is no accord between Iraq and the United States about a longer military presence . ”
Khalilzad said the chaos in Iraq since U.S. - led forces overthrew Saddam Hussein in 2003 was not unavoidable but arose from mistakes in the initial period of occupation .
“ Historians are discussing now whether we should have sent more troops to Iraq to preserve law and order , if it was right to dissolve the Iraqi army , if we should have built an Iraqi government quicker , if there should have been such a sweeping de-Baathification program ( removing Saddam - era officials ) . ”
We mobilize the public and put together rallies , protests , trainings and town - hall meetings across the country .

Our solar system , which careers around our galaxy ’s center at nearly half a million miles per hour , is n’t round .
It is n’t even symmetrical .
Instead , says George Mason University astrophysicist Merav
Opher , the sun ’s domain is shaped like a slightly squashed bullet and tilts up to 90 degrees away from the plane of the magnetic field of the rest of the Milky Way .
Opher got her results by working with particle and radio - wave data from the two Voyager probes , which are now more than 100 times as far from Earth as we are from the sun , near a boundary known as the termination shock .
There , the barrage of particles blasting out from the sun — the solar wind — is slowed by our motion through the galaxy .
Using the Voyager data , researchers can now monitor the magnetic field at the edge of our solar system .
“ Even though the local interstellar field is kind of weak , it really distorts the shape of our solar system , ” Opher says .
“ Because of our motion through the galaxy , we have a bullet shape , like a boat going through the ocean .
But the magnetic field takes our bullet shape and tilts it .
This is a huge effect ; we ’re really inclined . ”
Larry Craig Nabbed in Another Republican Gay Sex Scandal ( Yawn ) Posted by wizeGurl ( 14318 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Sex ]
Seriously , guys ... could you just save the entire country the trauma of watching you get caught in various types of secret sexual deviancy already ?
I mean , if it is n't gay flirting with Senate pages , or wearing diapers with hookers , it 's soliciting gay sex in airport bathrooms .
( I wo n't even count the fundamentalist minister putting the fun back in fundamental with gay prostitutes and crystal meth - - he 's not an elected official . )
That 's right , one more high - level Republican -- this time , the senior senator from Idaho , Larry Craig - - has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct after a police officer witnessed him engaging in lewd behavior in an airport bathroom .
According to the police report , Craig entered the airport restroom and lingered outside a stall occupied by a plainclothes police officer .
Craig then entered an adjacent toilet stall , tapped his foot against the officer 's foot and put his hand under the divider separating the two men .
The police officer then arrested him for lewd behavior .
But as always , it 's the hilarious details that we love about these stories .
During booking , Craig denied any guilt , saying " that he has a wide stance when going to the bathroom , " according to the police report .
His wide stance notwithstanding , he pleaded guilty to the charges on August 8 .
UPDATE : Sen .
Craig now says that his actions were " misinterpreted , " and he now regrets pleading guilty .
Y'know , it 's a real shame when U.S. Congressmen do n't have access to the kind of money and power required to get good legal advice .
If only someone with a sharp legal mind had been there to advise him that when you plead guilty , people will sort of naturally assume that you did it .

So , is anyone else disturbed by the fact that hinting you might want to engage in behavior that 's only marginally illegal ... is illegal ?
There was no monitary arrangement .
There was no nudity .
There was some footsie and , quite literally , hand - waving .
Ok , I get the peeping charge ( looking through the crack in the stall ) , but the disorderly conduct ?
What ?
" Engaging in offensive , obscene , abusive , boisterous , noisy conduct ... "
Yeah , not seein ' it .
damn pervert !!!

I 'm sorry but thats just gross , just gross !!!
I mean a number of people already admited to letting him pork em in public washrooms and a undercover cop catches him looking for a toiletstall humpingfest !!!
ewww , eww ewww ewwwwwwww .
And the peeping charge !!!
man
Thats new to me , , , I got one word to say about that , and that is you guessed it , Ewwww !!!
my goodness hmm
Posted by johana on 2007-08-31 13:14:02 i know the have cameras in all the stalls at the airport , why not get someone to monitor everyone doing poopy time , then if they engage in non poopy behaviour , raid them !
arrest them and send them to the pen !!!
johana Posted by ned on 2007 - 08 - 31 14:28:00 quit shamefull .
What I think they should do is spank him real real real hard , barebutted and on cnn !
he should be spanked till he 's red in the face , And I want to see hand welts on his behind when their done !!!
If that does n't stop him from having sex with man in the toilets then I do n't know what will !
And btw if i ever , and i mean ever catch someone peeking in the toilet stall crack at me taking a dump , AND I WILL CATCH HIM , drag him in there and dunk his face in my crap filled toilet !!!
DAMN RIGHT !!!
Senator , congressmen , hell if were the president I would do it !!!
toilet stall peepers better freakin watch out , , , Im mad , i'm mean and I 'm a biker , and I 'M BIG , and yes i will shove your face in it when i catch you peeking !!!
Posted by ned on 2007-08-31 14:48:58 and one more thing i forgot to mention , if i'm taking a dump and i so much as see someones hand come creeping into my stall from below , I WILL f-ing grab their hand and yank the guy right into my stall and ask him wtf he thinks he 's doing !!!

Well ned your one brave guy !
Mr Craig is lucky he was n't in a stall next to you .
I would just stun gun his hand if I saw his hand in my stall .

Tonight on Countdown , Keith delivered a powerful special comment about the leaked Bush Administration letter that blames Senator Hillary Clinton and all war dissenters for President Bush 's own failures in Iraq .

This , sir , is your war .
Go to Baghdad now and fulfill , finally , your military service obligations .
Transcripts below the fold ...
Good evening from Los Angeles .
And we begin with a Special Comment , on this day 's ominous , almost indescribable events .
It is one of the great , dark , evil lessons , of history .
A country -- a government -- a military machine -- can screw up a war seven - ways - to - Sunday ... it can get thousands of its people killed ... it can risk the safety of its citizens ... it can destroy the fabric of its nation .
But as long as it can identify a scapegoat , it can regain ... or even gain power .
The Bush Administration has , tonight , opened this Pandora 's Box , about Iraq .
It has found its scapegoats -- Hillary Clinton -- and us .
The lies and terror - tactics with which it deluded this country into war -- they had nothing to do with the abomination that Iraq has become -- it is n't Mr. Bush 's fault .
The selection of the wrong war , in the wrong time , in the wrong place -- the most disastrous a geo-political tactic since Austria - Hungary attacked Serbia in 1914 and destroyed itself in the process -- that had nothing to do with the overwhelming crisis Iraq has become -- it is n't Mr. Bush 's fault .
The criminal lack of planning for the war -- the total " jump - off - a- bridge - and - hope - you - can - fly " tone to the failure to anticipate what would follow the deposing of Saddam Hussein -- that had nothing to do with the chaos in which Iraq has been enveloped -- it is n't Mr. Bush 's fault .
The utter , blinkered idiocy of " staying the course " -- of sending Americans to Iraq , and sending them a second time , and a third , and a fourth , until they get killed or maimed -- the utter de-prioritization of human life , simply so a politician can avoid having to admit a mistake -- that had nothing to do with the tens of thousand individual tragedies darkening the lives of American families , forever -- it is n't Mr. Bush 's fault .
The continuing , relentless , remorseless , corrupt and cynical insistence that this conflict somehow is defeating , or containing , or just engaging the people who attacked us on 9/11 -- the total " Alice Through The Looking Glass " quality that ignores that in Iraq , we have made the world safer for Al - Qaeda -- it is n't Mr. Bush 's fault !
The fault , brought down -- as if a sermon from this mount of hypocrisy and slaughter , by a nearly anonymous Under - Secretary of Defense -- the fault has tonight been laid on the doorstep of Senator Hillary Clinton and , by extension , at the doorstep of every American -- the now vast majority of us -- who have dared to criticize this war , or protest it , or merely ask questions about it , or simply , plaintively , innocently , honestly , plead , " do n't take my son ; do n't take my daughter . "
Senator Clinton has been sent -- and someone has leaked to the Associated Press -- a letter , sent in reply to hers , asking if there exists , an actual plan for evacuating U.S. troops from Iraq .
This extraordinary document was written by an Under - Secretary of Defense named Eric Edelman .
" Premature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq , " Edelman writes , " reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq , much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam , Lebanon and Somalia . "
Edelman adds : " such talk understandably unnerves the very same Iraqi allies we are asking to assume enormous personal risks . "
A spokesman for the senator says Mr. Edelman 's remarks are " at once both outrageous and dangerous " and those terms are entirely appropriate and may in fact understate the risk the Edelman letter poses to our way of life , and all that our fighting men and women are risking , have risked , and have lost , in Iraq .
After the South was defeated in our Civil War , the scapegoat was Confederate President Jefferson Davis , and the ideas of the " Lost Cause " and " Jim Crow " were born .
After the French were beaten by the Prussians in 1870 and 1871 -- it was the imaginary " Jewish influence " in the French Army General Staff , and there was born 30 years of self - destructive anti-Semitism , culminating in the horrific Dreyfus case .
After the Germans lost the First World War , it was the " back - stabbers and profiteers " at home , on whose lives the National Socialists rose to prominence in the succeeding decades , and whose accused membership eventually wound up in torture chambers and death camps .
And after the generation before ours , and leaders of both political parties , escalated and re-escalated , and carpet bombed and re-carpet bombed , Vietnam , it was the protest movement and Jane Fonda and as late as just three years ago Senator John Kerry , who were assigned the kind of blame with which no rational human being could concur , and yet which still , across vast sections of our political landscape , resonates , unchallenged , and accepted .
And now Mr. Bush , you have picked out your own Jefferson Davis , your own Dreyfus , your own " profiteer " -- your own scapegoat .
Not for the sake of this country ...
Not for the sake of Iraq ...
Not even for the sake of your own political party ...
But for the sake of your own personal place in history .
But in reaching for that place , you have guaranteed yourself tonight , not honor , but infamy .
In fact , you have condemned yourself to a place among that remarkably small group of Americans whom Americans cannot forgive .
Those who have sold this country out , and who have willingly declared their enmity to the people at whose pleasure they supposedly serve .
A scapegoat , sir , might be forgivable , if you had n't just happened to choose a prospective presidential nominee of the opposition party .
And the accusation of spreading " enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq , much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam , Lebanon and Somalia , " might be some day atoned for , if we all did n't know -- you included , and your generals , and the Iraqis -- that we are leaving Iraq , and sooner rather than later -- and we are doing it , even if to do so requires first , that you must be impeached and removed as President of the United States , sooner , rather than later .
You have set this government at war against its own people , and then blamed those very people when they say , " enough . "
And thus it crystallizes , Mr. Bush .
When Civil War General Ambrose Burnside ordered a disastrous attack on Fredericksburg in which 12,000 of his men were killed , he had to be physically restrained from leading the next charge himself .
After the First Lord of the British Admiralty , Winston Churchill , authored and enabled the disastrous Gallipoli campaign that saw a quarter million Allied Soldiers cut down in the First World War , Churchill resigned his office and took a commisson as a front - line officer in the trenches of France .
Those are your new role models , Mr. Bush .
Let your minions try to spread the blame to the real patriots here , who have sought only to undo the horrors you have wrought since 2002 .
Let them try it , until the end of time .
Though the words might be erased from a million books and a billion memories , though the world be covered knee - deep in your lies , the truth shall prevail .
This , sir , is your war .
Senator Clinton has reinforced enemy propaganda ?
Made it impossible for you to get your ego - driven , blood - steeped win in Iraq ?
Then take it into your own hands , Mr. Bush .
Go to Baghdad now and fulfill , finally , your military service obligations .
Go there and fight , your war ... yourself .
Four other soldiers were injured in the attack near Basra
Susan Hull reaction
Lance Corporal of Horse Matty Hull , 25 , died near Basra on 28 March 2003 when a US pilot fired on his tank convoy .
US spokesman Sean McCormack said it was a " tragedy " during a time of war .
The coroner was critical of US failure to send witnesses to the inquest but the Pentagon said he had access to most information from its own inquiry .
Speaking at a State Department briefing in Washington , Mr McCormack said : " Clearly we do n't agree with the assessment .
What we have here is a tragedy that occurred during a time of war .
" We have conducted an investigation into the matter - our military has - they have come to their own conclusions .
" We certainly would not agree with any conclusion that categorised this as a criminal act . "
Widow reacts
Recording a narrative verdict , Oxford assistant deputy coroner Andrew Walker said L / Cpl Hull 's death was " entirely avoidable " .
" It was unlawful because there was no lawful reason for it and in that respect it was criminal , " he said .
The US pilots from the Idaho Air National Guard should have flown lower to confirm identities before opening fire , he added .
" I do n't think this was a case of honest mistake . "
Speaking after the verdict , L / Cpl Hull 's widow Susan said she was now prepared to " draw the line " on the event .
" I think all of our family feel it was the right verdict .
It was what we 'd waited four years to hear , " she said .
" It 's been a long and painful time and we need to move forward . "
But she said the lack of co-operation from the US was " very disappointing " .
The Ministry of Defence said it was " very sorry for confusion and upset " caused by the delay in releasing video footage taken from the cockpit of the US A - 10 plan .
The recording was not initially shown to the inquest , but the US authorities only agreed for it to be released after the footage was leaked to the Sun newspaper .
An MoD spokesman said a team has been set up to liaise with coroners and bereaved families and to ensure documents are made available quickly to future inquests .
Lawyer Geraldine McCool said the verdict did not suggest there would be a prosecution of the US pilot and the Hull family would not be calling for one .
' Combat environment '
Constitutional affairs minister Harriet Harman , who met with US diplomats in London ahead of the inquest , said she shared the " frustration " at their failure to send witnesses .
" I explained that this was not a criminal court , nobody could be found guilty and sent to prison , it is simply asking questions and requiring answers , " she said .
In a statement the US defence department described the incident as a " tragic accident " .
The Hull family believes key information was blacked out of a US Friendly Fire Investigation Board Report given to the coroner investigating his death .
But the Pentagon said the US shared all the information from its inquiry with the MoD , except those parts that had to be withheld for " security , privacy or other reasons " .
" The investigation determined that the incident took place in a complex combat environment , the pilots followed applicable procedures , " it said .
BC Cancer Agency scientists , led by Dr. Poul Sorensen , have discovered a novel gene that suppresses the growth of human tumours in multiple cancers , including breast , lung , and liver cancers , as well as melanomas , lymphomas and sarcomas .
Published in the advance online publication of Nature Medicine , the study found that a gene , HACE1 , has the ability to help cells deal with various forms of stress , including environmental cancer triggers that cause tumour formation .
When the HACE1 gene is missing or inactive , cancerous cells are able to form tumours , and when the gene is re-expressed , it prevents these cells from forming tumours .
The study was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Josef Penninger of the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences .
“ The discovery of this gene is very exciting because it clearly impacts a wide range of cancers , and provides a novel link between cellular stress and cancer , ” says Dr. Sorensen , Senior Scientist at the BC Cancer Agency , an agency of the Provincial Health Services Authority .
“ If we can learn how to reactivate HACE1 or block cancer cells from inactivating this gene , it may be possible to improve treatments for many cancer patients . ”
To test whether HACE1 is a tumour suppressor gene , researchers knocked out the gene in mice .
They hypothesized that the mice would be more susceptible to tumour growth , and diverse tumours did indeed form but at a low rate .
However , when the mice were also subjected to various forms of stress , including ultraviolet radiation , lung carcinogens , or other genetic alterations , this resulted in a dramatic increase in cancer growth , with the mice developing breast , lung , and liver cancers , as well as lymphomas , melanomas and sarcomas .
Researchers also re-introduced the HACE1 gene into human tumour cells and found that cells lost their ability to form tumours .
Conversely , when levels of HACE1 were experimentally reduced in non-cancerous cells , they were able to form tumours .
“ We ’ve always suspected that cancer is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors working together , ” says Dr. Sorensen .
“ Our results give us insight into how the disease takes root when a single gene is inactivated . ”
The next step is to study the biological mechanism that enables HACE1 to deal with cancer stress and block tumour formation .
Core support for research at the BC Cancer Agency is provided by the BC Cancer Foundation .
Support for this research project was also provided by the National Cancer Institute of Canada , the Children ’s Oncology Group , and the Johal Endowed Chair in Childhood Cancer Research through the BC Children ’s Hospital Foundation .
Weak Link in the Daily Grill Chain – While dining at the Daily Grill at LAX recently , I was reminded of the famous Bette Davis movie line , " What a dump ! "
I 've had many enjoyable meals at five other Daily Grill locations .
I 've had lunch and / or dinner at the Brentwood location at least 100 times over the years .
I know what to expect from the Daily Grill .
Unfortunately , this LAX version is far below their usual standards .
Far , far below !
The faux leather seating of my booth had a huge tear in it -- at least two feet long .
It looked as if it had been torn gradually over time and never repaired .
As I looked around , I could see that the entire place was in dire need of a major make - over , with obvious signs of wear and tear everywhere .
I 'm convinced our waiter does n't speak English .
He told us that they had no tomatoes , and when I asked why , he stated that they had no tomatoes .
I repeated my question , and he blankly repeated that they did n't have any tomatoes .
He appeared noticeably uncomfortable that I actually asked him a question .
I got the impression that he was hoping I would wordlessly point to the items on the menu that I wanted to order .
I tried to play it safe by ordering a cheeseburger ( $ 14 ) .
This was by far the worst cheeseburger I 've ever had .
The meat was completely tasteless ( and looked pre-formed , like the meat patties at Carl 's Jr. , but without the " charbroiled " flavor ) , the bun was stale -- and , of course , no tomato .
They also forgot the onion rings that are supposed to be on the burger .
I 'm normally a big fan of the Daily Grill -- but , definitely NOT this LAX version !
It is a sub-par imitation of a real Daily Grill .
Eat just about anywhere else instead .

The Del.icio.us Lesson
Personal value precedes network value .
The amazing popularity of the bookmarking site Del.icio.us is one of the hallmarks of the current social software renaissance happening on the Web .
Along with Flickr , Del.icio.us is a poster child of tagging , a simple feature whereby people attach words or phrases to an item .
In the case of Del.icio.us , those items are bookmarks .
While Del.icio.us rose to prominence , much was made of the ability to aggregate the tags that the service ’s user population created .
The resulting framework , called a folksonomy , promised to redefine web navigation .
If users could tag their own bookmarks and navigate to them through a direct tag - based interface , then there was really no need for an overarching , expert - developed taxonomy .
In addition , if Del.icio.us could aggregate the bookmarks over all users , they could come up with a folksonomy for everybody , based on how the total population actually valued and referred to the content .
One of the hardest problems in web design is to speak the user ’s language .
With folksonomies and tagging , the web site could be designed with , and evolved by , the user ’s own words .
Unfortunately , somewhere along the line the vast majority of excited technologists ( including me ) forgot the original reason why people use and enjoy Del.icio.us .
I call this reason the Del.icio.us Lesson , and I first posted about it last December in Learning more about Structured Blogging .
Since then , that post has become the most referenced post on Bokardo .
This post is an attempt to further illustrate the Del.icio.us Lesson .
Personal Value Precedes Network Value
The one major idea behind the Del.icio.us Lesson is that personal value precedes network value .
What this means is that if we are to build networks of value , then each person on the network needs to find value for themselves before they can contribute value to the network .
In the case of Del.icio.us , people find value saving their personal bookmarks first and foremost .
All other usage is secondary .
As people use Del.icio.us more , and in order to gain more personal value , they use tags to be able to find their bookmarks later .
Tagging is n’t even the primary function of Del.icio.us .
Most of the tagging done on Del.icio.us is done secondarily , and for personal use .
The social value of tags on Del.icio.us is only a happy side - effect .
Even though most of the ink spilled about Del.icio.us is about the social value , it ’s really not the reason why people use it .
Similar to Google aggregating links that were originally created for taking readers from one document to another , Del.icio.us can aggregate tags in order to find out how people value content .
If 1,000 people save and tag the same bookmark , for example , that ’s a good sign that they find value in it .
But to think that people tag so that this information can be aggregated is to give people a trait of altruism they just do n’t possess .
Blinded by the Aggregation Light
Unfortunately , the ability to aggregate has blinded many software developers to think that tags are a cure - all to the success of their software .
Tags have almost become a requisite feature in new software .
I ’ve received many emails in which developers try to sell me on the merits of their brand - new software based mostly on the ability of potential users to tag things , as if users inherently enjoy tagging things as a matter of course .
Real people , in contrast , tag for their own benefit .
And they surely wo n’t tag if the incentive to do so is n’t clear .
Aggregation , in general , is probably more effective as a second - order feature of software .
If we create features just to aggregate them , without providing users with tangible value first , then people simply wo n’t use the features .
My guess is that aggregation technologies which prove most useful will be ones that are added to some activity that users have already started doing without the promise of any aggregation benefits .
Why Del.icio.us
Tags are n’t like Meta Keywords
Shortly after Yahoo bought Flickr , Danny Sullivan , of Search Engine Watch , was dubiously skeptical of tags .
He compared them with the meta keyword tag , observing that meta keyword tags have failed miserably on the Web and are n’t recognized by major search engines .
He was certainly right : meta keyword tags are n’t useful anymore .
However , Del.icio.us tags are n’t like meta keyword tags because of the Del.icio.us Lesson .
Meta keyword tags provide no personal value whatsoever .
All of their value is social .
They ’re for aggregation engines to find and tell other people about .
In other words , they ’re for getting attention only .
Del.icio.us tags , on the other hand , provide personal value each time someone uses them to recall a bookmark .
Danny was right to be skeptical , though .
Some tagging initiatives do n’t seem to provide much personal value at all .
On sites like Amazon and Technorati , who have their own versions of tags , it is not clear what personal value users are getting .
On Amazon , we already have multiple wish lists for items we want to remember .
On Technorati , the tags seem like a pure - play for aggregation benefit without any real benefits for users .
Dave Sifry ’s suggestion that “ Many bloggers use this ( Technorati’s ) tagging capability to help get their content found by people who are searching for a particular topic ” sounds an awful lot like the value promised by meta keywords .
Going further , the Del.icio.us Lesson might help us parse Dave ’s statistics , especially this one : 47 % of blog posts have tags or categories associated with them .
If the Del.icio.us Lesson is predictive , it would suggest that nearly all of that 47 % would be categories that users are applying for their personal value on their blog , rather than tags applied for attention only .
Any way to separate out those numbers , Dave ?
Working toward Valuable Services
The level of innovation and discussion in and around tagging is phenomenal .
There is increasing talk about tagging in intranets , there is Rashmi Sinha ’s great piece on why tags are easier than categories , and there is even a Collaborative Web Tagging Workshop at WWW2006 this month .
Tagging , it seems , has hit the big time .
Everybody wants to know how and why tags work , and the best working example is the site that started it all : Del.icio.us .
Philipp Keller ( who will be speaking about tags at WWW2006 ) in a post about how to spread the word on tagging , asks “ is the tagging revolution stuck ? “ .
This is a common question these days , as the number of services trying to leverage tagging skyrockets .
I say no , tagging is n’t stuck .
Just do n’t try and make it the primary thing to do .
Instead , make sure personal value preceeds network value .
Then you ’ll have plenty to aggregate .

Ten years ago today , Carl Sagan died .
I lost one of my great heroes , and the world lost one of its greatest popularizers of science .
Sagan ’s efforts were not limited to physics and astronomy but extended to molecular biology and evolution , as in this clip from his famous series Cosmos .
Here , he describes two tales of artificial selection ( of the Heike crab in Japan , and of domestic animals ) , using these stories to create a foundation from which to discuss natural selection .
In the meantime , he takes a couple of premonitory shots at intelligent design ( a nonsense that he was mercifully spared , but which it would have been breathtaking to see him demolish ) :
Sagan was not the first to use artificial selection , a notion to which few would object , to demonstrate the reasonability of natural selection .
From The Origin of the Species first chapter , “ Variation Under Domestication ” :
Thus , a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can , and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs , but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed .
Nevertheless I cannot doubt that this process , continued during centuries , would improve and modify any breed … by this very same process , only carried on more methodically , did greatly modify , even during their own lifetimes , the forms and qualities of their cattle .
Slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago , which might serve for comparison .
It may well have been Sagan ’s introduction of artificial selection to me as a rapt nine - year - old on the family room sofa that made it so simple for me as an adult to accept the logic of evolution by natural selection .
Whenever people ask why I became a biologist , my answer invariably includes Cosmos .
Sometimes it ’s the story of the Heike crab ; other times it is my clear memory of a computer animation of DNA polymerase , methodically adding nucleotide blocks to a new growing strand ; at yet others it is Carl ’s willingness to entertain fanciful projections of the possible appearance of life on other worlds .
Cosmos provided rich food for my young mind , and I will always be grateful .
Thank you , Dr. Sagan .
“ … and sometimes I despair the world will never see another man like him . ”

Representational State Transfer ( REST ) is the explicit architecture of HTTP and the World Wide Web .
It is a well - designed , well thought out system that enables scalable applications that service millions of users .
It is also a simpler system that enables developers who understand it to bring applications to market faster that perform better .
Well , actually , no , it ’s not .
And therein lies a story .
HTTP is based on four basic operations : GET , PUT , POST , and DELETE .
GET is used for safe operations : ones without any side effects .
GETable operations can be completely specified by the URL and can be bookmarked , linked to , prefetched , cached , and otherwise optimized .
POST is used for unsafe operations : ones that cause things to happen .
You ca n’t even use the back button on a post without seeing a warning .
For example , pressing the buy button in an online store should be a post because it causes the credit card to be charged .
Pushing the buy button twice , causes you to be charged twice .
That ’s unsafe and should n’t be done by a machine without a human decision .
Furthermore , a lot of the data for a POST request is actually encapsulated in the the HTTP request body , not in the URL as with a GET .
Thus POST operations cannot be bookmarked , linked to , prefetched , cached , and otherwise optimized .
However , POST is the most general method and can be used for almost anything .
PUT is used to create or update a resource at a specific URL .
PUT is not safe ( it changes or creates a new resource ) but it is idempotent .
That means that if you are n’t sure if a request succeeded , try it again .
PUTting the same content twice is not a problem .
The end result is the same as PUTting it once .
By contrast , POSTing a form twice might mean you ’ve bought two copies of Oops !…
I Did It Again ( and one ’s embarrassing enough ) .
.
That means that if you are n’t sure if a request succeeded , try it again .
PUTting the same content twice is not a problem .
The end result is the same as PUTting it once .
By contrast , POSTing a form twice might mean you ’ve bought two copies of Oops !…
I Did It Again ( and one ’s embarrassing enough ) .
Finally DELETE is the simplest method .
It deletes the resource at a specified URL .
It too is idempotent , since deleting a previously deleted resource has no effect .
The beauty of REST is that those four verbs are all you need .
Everything you need to do can be done with GET , PUT , POST , and DELETE .
You do n’t need to invent a new verb for every operation you can imagine .
This make HTTP scalable , flexible , and extensible .
Simplicity leads to power .
The problem is that GET , PUT , POST , and DELETE really are a minimal set .
You truly do need all four , and we only have two ; and I ’ve never understood why .
In 2006 browser vendors still do n’t support PUT and DELETE .
A few browsers over the years have tried to implement these as parts of editing functionality , but they ’ve never allowed it in a real web application as opposed to a thick client GUI .
The method of an HTML form is limited to GET and POST .
PUT and DELETE are not allowed .
This is n’t some failure of browser vendors to properly implement the specification either .
The HTML specification only allows GET and POST as form actions .
XHTML and even XForms 1.0 do n’t change this .
This means it ’s impossible to build a fully RESTful client application inside a web browser .
Consequently everyone tunnels everything through POST , and simply ignores PUT and DELETE .
I ’m getting really tired of explaining REST to people , and then having to back off and say , “ This does n’t actually work yet , and there does n’t seem to be a possibility of it working in the near future . ”
Why do we have to tunnel everything through POST ?
Why do n’t HTML forms support PUT and DELETE ?
I ’d understand it if the browser vendors had simply failed to implement the spec .
Lord knows they ’ve ignored enough other things in the past .
But that ’s not the case .
Even XForms 1.0 restricted itself to GET and POST , because , hard as it is to believe , the working group could n’t think of any use - cases for PUT and DELETE !
Fortunately , the REST train may finally be leaving the station , even if it ’s years late .
XForms 1.1 will allow DELETE and PUT as form actions .
No mainstream browsers have yet implemented even XForms 1.0 , but maybe we ’ll be able to use them sometime before I retire .
If you do n’t want to wait that long , you can roll your own with AJAX .
It ’s easy enough to set the method of an open call to PUT or DELETE :
var request = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; request.open ( " DELETE " , " http://www.example.com/foo/bar.html " , true ) ;
At this point you ’re halfway to rolling your own thick client GUI , but at least you can deploy it inside a web browser .
If you are rolling your own thick client GUI , then your options open up a little , as long as you use an HTTP library with full support for PUT and DELETE such as the Apache HttpClient 3.0 .
Even java.net .
HttpURLConnection will do in a pinch ; and if worst comes to worst , you can always roll your own on top of raw sockets .
Of course , then you have to worry about the server side .
The support is once again not as ubiquitous as it should be , but it ’s a lot better than on the client .
All major web servers accept PUT and DELETE requests , and most recent versions of web app frameworks like the Java Servlet API or PHP also do .
Some older versions have problems , but it ’s easier to upgrade your server than everybody ’s client .
You may have to tell the server how to handle a PUT or DELETE request , just as you have to tell it how to handle a POST .
In the future , I ’d like to see mainstream servers treat PUT and DELETE more like GET : that is , support them out of the box with a little basic configuration rather than requiring a script to tell them how to handle it .
POST needs a script because a POST can mean almost anything , but PUT and DELETE should n’t require the webmaster to set up more than a simple configuration and some user names and passwords .
However , it really is the client side , that ’s the problem .
Right now the best option for client - side PUT and DELETE seems to be to hook up a some onClick actions that use JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest to send the right verb at the right time .
It makes me gag to depend on JavaScript for anything , but there really does n’t seem to be a better choice ; nor does one seem likely soon .
Was n’t REST supposed to make things simpler ?
If you ’re new to fencing then you may be surprised to learn that there are different types of fencing swords and different competition rules for using them .
I used to think that fencing was fencing and that the swords were all alike .
Now I know better , of course !
Types Of Fencing Swords
There are in fact three different sword types :
the Foil
the Epee , and
the Sabre
In fencing , you always duel against the same type of sword .
Foils
These are light - weight swords with a blade that is thin and rounded , so very flexible .
They were originally made from rolled steel foil ( hence the name ) .
Foils are the most common sword to start learning with .
However , that does n’t mean they are just for beginners .
But the discipline and skills developed by training first with a foil can be transferred to the other two swords .
When duelling with foils , only the tip of the sword may be used to strike your opponent and score , and only the torso may be used as a target .
This is a hangover from the origins of fencing in the 16th century where it was used to train pupils in the art of duelling and sharpen their skills by forcing them to target areas that had lethal consequences .
That way , their opponents were less likely to recover and kill them instead !
Fortunately , modern sporting swords have a round button that covers the otherwise sharp tip to prevent it from doing any real damage .
Because opponents may have advantages over each other ( such as height ) , special “ Right of Way ” rules have been developed to even the odds and reward technical and tactical skill .
Points can be scored by defending as well as attacking .
If an attack results in an off - target strike then the action is stopped and resumed from the initial ‘ on - guard ’ position .
Epees
These are similar to Foils but generally heavier .
Again , points are scored by striking your opponent only with the tip of the sword .
But unlike in Foil fencing , you can strike any part of the body and there is no “ Right of Way ” rule .
If both opponents make a strike at the same time then both score a point .
So Epee duels are very fast and furious , and very popular , probably because almost anything goes !
Sabres
Ah , now we ’re talking !
While Foil and Epee blades are thin and round , Sabres tend to be wider and flat , and therefore less flexible except towards the tip .
With Sabres , you can attack with a cutting action and score with a strike from either side of the blade , not just the tip as with Foils and Epees .
Sabre fighting originates from the late 17th century .
It was the weapon of choice for cavalrymen on horseback .
For this reason , when duelling with Sabres , the target area is restricted to just the upper body since a cut below the ‘ saddle ’ line could hit the horse .
However , unlike with Foils , that does include the arms and head .
Sabre duels also follow the same “ Right of Way ” rules as for Foil duels but an off - target hit does not stop the action .
So what about Rapiers ?
You may also see references to Rapier swords .
These are the heavy , original 16th century swords that Foil and Epee swords were based on .
So most of the Rapiers being sold are reproductions for collectors and for use in re-enactments .
Probably not something you would actually want to fence with !
Grips
Fencing swords can often be highly customised for personal preference .
Sabres nearly always have a straight ‘ French ’ style grip with a rounded bell guard to protect the fingers .
But Foils and Epees are available with many choices of grip including a strange ‘ Pistol ’ grip that is designed to make the sword more comfortable , reduce wrist injuries and offer finer control .
Sword Sizes
The blade of an adult sword will typically be between 85 cm and 96 cm ( 33 ″ and 38 ″ ) in length with the grip extending a further 18 cm ( 7 ″ ) .
Smaller swords are generally used by children and various sizes are available .
Electric Swords
When you ’re just practising , getting the scoring exactly right is not so important .
It ’s all about learning the skill of fencing .
But in competition , it ’s vitally important to know who struck who , where and when , especially with Foil and Sabre duels .
Because fencing is such a fast sport , electronic systems were introduced to help out .
All competition swords have electrical connections and many practice swords can be upgraded to include one .
I hope this has helped to give you a better understanding of the different types of fencing swords and how they are used in competition .
Heading into freedom weekend , THREAT LEVEL decided to ask readers to indulge in some free speech , whistle blowing , corporate bashing by submitting and voting on which companies have the worst privacy practices .
Spammers , squealers and slimy data sellers are all fair game .
For instance , Just a couple weeks ago , I bought a couple tickets to see Sonic Youth perform its Daydream Nation album in its entirety .
The tickets were $ 35 a piece ( ouch ) and Ticketmaster 's usurious fees that reached 33 % of the tickets face value , put the tickets at over $ 90 .
But the kicker came in my inbox where Ticketmaster and concert promoter Live Nation began sending me spam almost immediately .
Both companies believe that the mere fact that I bought a ticket for a show through Ticketmaster means they have the right to add me to their spam lists without asking .
Admittedly , this is legal under the CAN - SPAM Act , but that does n't make it right .
I emailed privacy contacts at both Ticketmaster and Live Nation , but neither has responded and their spam keeps coming .
So I 'm nominating both Ticketmaster and Live Nation as entrants in this tally of the companies with the worst spam and privacy practices .
But I 'm certain my pet peeves wo n't last long in the top ten .

A rare rainbow , called a circumhorizontal arc , presents itself to the skies of Idaho ( Image : Brian Plonka / WPN )
Noon , Saturday 3 June .
Over the fields of northern Idaho , a rare and beautiful sight could be seen .
Known as a circumhorizontal arc , it forms as sunlight is refracted through hexagonal ice crystals in cirrus clouds several kilometres above the ground .
Sunlight enters a near - vertical face of each crystal and leaves from a horizontal face at the bottom .
“ Effectively the crystals act as a 90 - degree prism for the passing rays , ” says Evelyn Hesse of the light - scattering group at the University of Hertfordshire in …
I see your talking raven and raise you one tool - fashioning crow .
To obtain out - of - reach food , the crow repeatedly took a piece of straight wire and bent it to create a hook .
According to the researchers , who report their findings in the August 9 , 2002 issue of Science , this behavior suggests that New Caledonian crows " rival nonhuman primates in tool - related cognitive capabilities . "
New Caledonian crows living in the wild do create hooked probes from twigs , but the captive crow did something very different .
" To our knowledge , there are no confirmed reports of any animal making a hook out of unnatural material , such as wire , to solve a new problem , " said Alex Kacelnik , a behavioral ecologist who coauthored the report with Alex A. S. Weir and Jackie Chappell .

A rumor is circulating among well - connected and formerly high - level Iraqi bureaucrats in exile in places like Damascus that a military coup is being prepared for Iraq .
I received the following from a reliable , knowledgeable contact .
There is no certitude that this plan can or will be implemented .
That it is being discussed at high levels seems highly likely .
“ There is serious talk of a military commission ( majlis `askari ) to take over the government .
The parties would be banned from holding positions , and all the ministers would be technocrats , so to speak .
. .
[ The writer indicates that attempts have been made to recruit cabinet members from the ranks of expatriate technocrats . ]
The six - member board or commission would be composed on non-political former military personnel who are presently not part of the government OR the military establishment , such as it is in Iraq at the moment .
It is said that the Americans are supporting this behind the scenes .
The plan includes a two - year period during which political parties would not be permitted to be part of the government , but instead would prepare and strengthen the parties for an election which would not have lists , but real people running for real seats .
The two year period would be designed to take control of security and restore infrastructure .
. . .[ I ]t is another [ desperate plan ] , but one which many many Iraqis will support , since they are sick of their country being pulled apart by the “ imports ” – Maliki , Allawi , Jaafari et al .
The military group is composed of internals , people who have the goal of securing the country even at the risk of no democracy , so they say . “
Lately I ’ve been trying a promising new method for managing my time .
It ’s similar to timeboxing , except that instead of allocating a certain amount of time for a specific activity , I divide my total work time between three different classes of activities .
Here ’s how it works …
First , I define three different classes of activities based on the time period in which I expect them to pay off .
Classes of Tasks
A tasks are expected to yield significant benefits over a 5 - year time span and beyond .
This could include starting a new business , writing a book , changing my diet , adding a new passive income stream , etc .
It ’s perfectly fine for an A task to start producing benefits in a shorter period of time , but the idea is that I expect such tasks to still be having a lasting impact 5 + years from now .
This has to be a genuinely realistic expectation , not just wishful thinking .
B tasks are expected to yield benefits over a 2 - year timespan or less .
This class may include writing a new series of articles or blog entries , selling an advertising package , or training to run a marathon .
While there could be long - term benefits that extend for many years , the general expectation is that the benefits will be fully realized sometime within the first two years , and there wo n’t be much additional payoff beyond that .
Think of these as one - shot projects .
You do them once , gain the benefit , and move on .
C tasks are expected to make a difference only in the timespan of 90 days or less .
Most likely I wo n’t even remember the task or see evidence of its benefits beyond that time .
This includes routine actions like answering email , paying bills , returning phone calls , and filing .
If these tasks are n’t done , it might create problems down the road , but doing them well is n’t likely to yield a significant long - term payoff .
There ’s certainly some ambiguity in these definitions , but I ’m OK with that because it allows for flexibility around the edges .
The 50 - 30 - 20 for Time Allocation
The 50 - 30 - 20 rule says that I spend 50 % of my work time on A tasks , 30 % on B tasks , and 20 % on C tasks .
For example , if I work 8 hours per day , that would mean 4 hours on A tasks , 2:24 on B tasks , and 1:36 on C tasks .
The time boundary for C tasks is an upper limit .
This means that I do n’t spend more than 20 % of my work time on C tasks ; if I run out of time , I carry remaining C tasks over to the next day .
The A task boundary is a lower limit , which means I must spend at least 50 % of my work time on A tasks .
The B class absorbs the slack if I go over 50 % on A or under 20 % on C .
I ’ve only been doing this for a few days now , and I can already see that it has a lot of potential .
It ’s similar to other task allocations like Stephen Covey ’s four - quadrant approach , but it actually specifies how much time to invest in each type of activity .
Although this can be done weekly , I find it best to make the time allocations daily when possible .
But if I get overloaded with C tasks one day , I may do virtually none the next day to keep the right weekly balance .
At first I found it very uncomfortable to spend so little time on C tasks , especially when I felt driven to check them off and get them off my task list .
But I could see I was spending too much time on C tasks relative to their worth , while high priority A tasks were being sacrificed .
When I look at a task and see that it will have virtually no impact beyond the current week or month , it helps me see that relatively speaking , the task is a waste of time .
I do n’t have time to complete every single task on my to do list , so I have to sacrifice a lot of good tasks in order to invest sufficient time in the best ones .
Simply doing what comes up each day is incredibly suboptimal — I know because I ’ve tried it .
As previously mentioned I ’ve been getting a lot of email lately due to the increase in traffic this year , more than I can personally answer .
However , virtually all email falls into the C class .
It ’s often urgent but rarely anywhere near the importance of A tasks .
If I were to respond appropriately to all the email I get , it would consume most of my working hours .
Whether I do a great job of answering email or a lousy job , it ’s not going to make that much difference in where I ’ll end up 5 years from now .
Spending more time on email wo n’t help me accomplish my most important goals except through luck or chance .
So I steal time from this area and reallocate it to A and B tasks , since those tasks are actually likely to have a significant long - term impact .
One of my current A tasks is setting new goals for 2006 .
This could have a significant long - term impact based on which goals I choose .
I ’ll be spending at least a couple hours on this task today .
Writing a blog entry like this falls into my B class .
I ’m sure visitors will still be reading this blog entry beyond 90 days , but I ca n’t predict in advance whether this entry will have a significant impact beyond five years .
It ’s the long - term strategy of writing and content development ( A task ) that makes the difference in this time span .
The longer the time perspective , the less important any individual blog post becomes .
Processing today ’s email is one of my C tasks for today .
I probably wo n’t spend more than 15 minutes total on email .
This means that I ’ll only have enough time to respond to perhaps 1 - 2 emails out of every 10 ( not counting spam ) .
I ’m still able to read it all and extract ideas and suggestions , but my writing time is better spent producing articles to be seen by thousands of people rather than individual emails to be seen by only one person .
Sacrificing the Urgent for the Important
Sometimes it ’s hard to sacrifice those C tasks .
I ’ve been using email since 1989 , and this is really the first year where I ’ve had to triage my email so ruthlessly in order to free up time for higher priority tasks .
It is n’t easy to follow , but I like that this system helps me stay focused on tasks which have significant long - term potential instead of those that will merely be forgotten .
By limiting my C tasks to a certain amount of time each day , I create plenty of space for my A tasks .
If you find yourself not getting ahead after years of hard work , perhaps it ’s because too much of your time is focused on short - term C tasks like answering email , attending meetings , and filling out paperwork .
Maybe you could afford to spend less time on those activities in order to reinvest it in what matters most .
Otherwise those little tasks will crowd out the more important ones ; the time pressure of C tasks will see to that .
The ratio of 50 - 30 - 20 ratio is arbitrary , but it feels about right for me .
It gives me enough time to stay on top of the truly urgent , while I ’m still putting a lot of time behind the scenes into projects I expect will make a real difference down the road .
You may wish to vary these percentages based on the nature of your work and your goals .
What ’s important is that we remain consciously aware of how our time is being invested .
Rebalancing Your Time Portfolio
If you ’re familiar with stock investing , think of this model as your portfolio allocation across different levels of risk .
Your A tasks are your high risk , high return investments that may see a lot of short - term volatility , but in the long run , you expect they ’ll pay off better than any other type of investment .
These are your aggressive growth stocks .
The C tasks are your safe , secure investments like a bank savings account .
And the B tasks fall in the mid-range .
If you have n’t been paying attention to your portfolio for a while , it ’s a good idea to go back and rebalance your allocations .
The reason to invest in A tasks is to capitalize on long - term opportunities .
These are the whale projects that could make an enormous positive difference in your life .
Examples from my life are starting my businesses , getting married , and going vegan .
It ’s hard to spend too much time on these types of tasks .
Ideally we want to invest as much time here as we can manage .
The reason to invest in C tasks is to prevent problems .
C tasks keep you out of trouble .
You should spend only a minimal amount of time on them … just whatever is necessary to prevent serious problems .
This includes paying your bills on time , doing your taxes , and doing a reasonable job of keeping up on your communication .
In most cases there ’s no real benefit to doing a great job vs. doing an adequate job — the time difference would be better reallocated to A and B tasks .
B tasks usually fall between A and C tasks .
They help keep you out of trouble , but they also help you get ahead slightly .
They entail moderate risk and offer moderate rewards .
They often help reduce the need for C tasks and free up more time for A tasks .
Organizing and optimizing would usually fall into the B class .
B tasks help put you in a position to capitalize on bigger A task opportunities .
Reading this blog entry is probably a B - class activity for you .
You might find one good idea now and then which will help put you into a position to do more A tasks and fewer C tasks .
Outside of my work time activities , I also have a personal tasks list .
This includes family and home activities .
I have n’t yet tried prioritizing those according to the 50 - 30 - 20 rule , but if it works well for my business , I might also try it for my personal life .
If you want to try this system for a week , simply divide your to do list by putting an A , B , or C next to each task on your to do list .
Then grab a scrap of paper , and make three columns or boxes for tracking how much time you spend on A , B , and C. Estimate how much time you expect to work each day ( breaks do n’t count ) , and then calculate the time limits for each class .
If you want to use a ratio other than 50 - 30 - 20 , feel free .
As you go through your workday , use a stopwatch to time each activity , and then record the elapsed time in your A , B , or C columns .
At the end of the day , add up the times , and then calculate your percentages to see how you did .
The first day or two you may want to just measure your current ratio without actually trying to change anything .
Most likely you ’ll find an imbalance you ’d like to correct .
For example , if you see your actual ratio is something like 10 - 10 - 80 , you know you ’re just spinning your wheels and are n’t going to make much progress in your career .
So you might want to look at those C tasks and see which ones can be reduced , delayed , or cut in order to free up more time for A and B tasks .
Even the mere act of measuring will raise your awareness of where your time is going .
The more time you ’re spending on A tasks , the better .
If you find that you ’re overwhelmed with C tasks , steal as much time as you can from them and devote it to B tasks .
Use your B time to become more organized and effective , such that you are n’t as urgency driven .
Then you can devote some of that savings to A tasks .
It ’s perfectly OK to change your ratio over time .
If you ’re at 10 - 10 - 80 , you may not be able to jump straight over to 50 - 30 - 20 .
You might need to first attempt 5 - 40 - 55 and then 20 - 50 - 30 to get those C tasks tamed .
In the long run , it ’s the A tasks that make or break us .
If we do n’t do them , we essentially let our potential go to waste .
Who wants to devote the bulk of their lives to answering email and paying bills ?
We need to keep such tasks from taking over our lives , so we have time to tackle the truly great challenges that can make a real difference to us … and to the world .
In a drab strip mall in north Seattle , nestled between a hair salon and a State Farm outlet , Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins are working on an idea for the next installment of Penny Arcade , their hugely popular webcomic .
Their nine - room office is a gamer 's paradise — Willy Wonka 's long - lost chip fab .
There are dozens of Xbox 360s , a heaping carton full of Nintendo Wiimotes , an SNK arcade cabinet , a vintage Atari Lynx handheld .
The walls are covered with blowups of their work and game posters autographed by the developers .
There 's also a floor - to - ceiling stack of the latest videogames , sent by publishers eager to be mentioned in the strip .
" We 'll throw them on sometimes when we 're looking for grist for the day 's comic , " Holkins says .
Krahulik wrinkles his nose .
" Grist for the day 's comic ?
Grist ? ! "
" Yes , grist , " Holkins says loftily .
" Look it up .
It 's a word . "

to report an issue .
Krahulik shakes his head in disgust .
" You 're a douche .
That 's a douche word .
Why do n't you just say ‘ raw material ' or something ? "
It 's a fairly typical conversation for the webcomic superstars .
When they are n't trying to crack each other up , they 're ridiculing each other .
Krahulik mocks Holkins ' pretensions ; Holkins mocks Krahulik 's ignorance .
This friendly antagonism fuels their strip , which stars two slightly fictionalized versions of themselves .
Holkins , 31 , and Krahulik , 29 , have cranked out three strips every week for the past eight years .
They check the latest headlines on game sites , scrutinize the latest screenshots and gameplay footage released by publishers , gab about what they 've been playing , and try to settle on a topic by lunchtime .
Holkins types up the dialog and narration while Krahulik sketches something on paper , scans it into his PC , and uses a Wacom tablet and Photoshop to draw the final version .
Even with frequent breaks to goof off , they 're finished by five in the afternoon .
Then the comic is uploaded to their 10 - server collocation facility in San Jose .
Within 24 hours , it will get a quarter of a million hits .
For more , visit wired.com / video Penny Arcade Adventures Penny Arcade may be invisible to the vast majority of Americans , but it has enormous reach and influence among people who care about games — the developers who create them , the publishers who sell them , the retail wage slaves who put them on store shelves , and the gamers who buy them .
The dialog is cited like the Talmud in online debates , and the bizarre words it has coined are part of gamers ' everyday speech — like bullshot , a gorgeous screengrab of a game that gives a false impression of its graphics .
Krahulik and Holkins make a comfortable living from the strip , what with 55 million monthly pageviews driving online advertising and merchandising .
They have a full - time staff of 10 .
They oversee a charity that has given $ 2.2 million worth of toys and games to children 's hospitals since 2003 .
And in late August , their annual convention — the Penny Arcade Expo — will attract 30,000 visitors , making it the largest game conference in the US .
This is the story of how two douches from Spokane , Washington , became the most powerful players in the videogame industry .
" The term geek has acquired a patina , " says Holkins , a writer prone to ornate verbiage and renowned for his witty blog posts that accompany each strip .
He 's right — the word is being reclaimed as a badge of pride .
But the creators of Penny Arcade are n't among these geek - come - latelies .
They 're unreconstructed geeks of the old - school variety — which is to say , of the high school variety .
Krahulik has glasses , a beanpole physique , and a touch of overbite that gives him a pained expression .
Holkins , who also wears glasses , is balding and so pale that he looks like he could get moonburns .
Growing up , they were the prototypical misfits , ostracized by the cool kids at school .
Holkins claims that he owes his success to those formative encounters with jocks and their lacrosse sticks .
" I 've been repaid a thousand times over for the damage they inflicted , " he says cheerfully .
Krahulik agrees .
" One time in high school , someone broke into my locker and stole my stuff , so I had to wear gym clothes for the rest of the day , " he says , wincing at the memory .
" I developed humor as a defense mechanism .
Now I drive a fucking Mercedes . "
The two met 14 years ago in a journalism class at Mead High School in Spokane .
Holkins , a senior and a staff writer on the school paper , noticed Krahulik 's portfolio and wanted to team up with the aspiring cartoonist .
After graduation , they spent their free time making what Krahulik calls " overwrought superhero comics " and playing videogames — lots and lots of videogames .
While they waited for their creations , like Chickenman and Clan Walrus , to set the world on fire , Krahulik stocked shelves in the electronics section of Toys " R " Us and Circuit City .
Holkins found a slightly more lucrative gig doing tech support for the local school district .
The two took an apartment together in 1997 , and Holkins paid a bigger share of the rent , subsidizing his friend so he'd always have a gaming partner .
He also nurtured a vague sense that they were destined for greatness as a creative unit .
" I was very sure that one of the things we were working on would hit , " he says .
Combining their passion for games with their skills as writer and artist never occurred to them until one day in the fall of 1998 , when a now - defunct enthusiast magazine put out a call for game - themed comic strips .
Their submissions were rejected , but a Web site targeted at gamers agreed to run the strips — and then asked for more .
By putting themselves in the comic , they tapped into the classic buddy - comedy formula : Holkins is the left - brained PC gamer , Krahulik the right - brained console gamer .
Holkins ' alter ego , Tycho , named after the 16th - century astronomer Tycho Brahe , is an imperious egotist who loves to scrutinize the story and structure of a game .
Krahulik 's character , Gabe , is an oblivious jerk who adores cool graphics , explosions , and gloating over victories .
They 're perfect complements — Abbott and Costello or Mario and Luigi .
For six months , Holkins and Krahulik wrote their comic gratis .
They had no idea how popular Penny Arcade had become until they moved to their own site in 1999 .
It turned out they were getting a million pageviews a month .
When that number quadrupled the following year , they quit their day jobs .
The site now averages 55 million pageviews a month — more , for example , than Gizmodo .
The Penny Arcade format is familiar — usually a traditional three - panel strip culminating in a gag , like Dilbert or Garfield .
But Penny Arcade will never be syndicated in newspapers ; the humor is incomprehensible to normals , full of references to load times , character classes , and experience points .
It mercilessly lampoons individuals most people have never heard of : Take that , vice president of online commerce at Electronic Arts !
And that , CEO of GameStop !
It 's also joyously and unapologetically filthy , shot through with the sort of scatological epithets that gamers heap on one another in the heat of battle .
It 's not like Holkins and Krahulik have any interest in getting into newsprint anyway .
They 've become media titans and taste makers on their own terms .
Within their subculture , the Penny Arcade guys are like Roger Ebert , Richard Pryor , Thomas Nast , and Edward R. Murrow all rolled into one .
Fans memorize punch lines and wear Penny Arcade T - shirts .
References to the comic pop up in games .
" The Penny Arcade guys represent the true voice of the dedicated gamer , " says Warren Spector , creator of the Deus Ex series of games .
" From the start , it was so apparent that they were just a couple of game grognards like the rest of us . "
One of Penny Arcade 's biggest attractions is that it dares to be dismissive .
Most of the enthusiast press is loath to offend the publishers who provide advertising and access to their content .
But if Holkins and Krahulik think the lightcycle mode in Tron 2.0 is shit , they say so , and they use the word shit .
( They also stress that they do n't mean it 's " the shit . " )
Teen fans love the strip for serving up such flame - war ammo .
Then there 's the willingness to wade into the technical , political , and cultural issues surrounding games .
This earns Penny Arcade plaudits from eggheads :
After participating in an epic online discussion about real - money transactions in virtual worlds , game scholar Julian Dibbell linked to one of Holkins and Krahulik 's strips and wrote , " It is humbling almost to the point of despair to discover that 15 dozen screenfuls of ponderous commentary produced by a small liberal - arts faculty 's worth of beardy gamer geeks can , with almost zero loss of insight , be reduced to the three panels of a Penny Arcade cartoon . "
Back at the office , everyone is playing Ping - Pong .
Not Pong , mind you , but actual meatspace Ping - Pong .
Krahulik is working up a sweat trying to return vicious serves from Robert Khoo .
" Having our own Ping - Pong table has been a longtime goal for the company , " says Khoo , Penny Arcade 's director of business develop ment .
" We just knocked out a wall and took over the adjoining office , so we finally have the room . "
Khoo , 27 , met Holkins and Krahulik five years ago .
A business analyst at a market strategy firm , he was discussing an advertising deal with the pair over lunch at the Golden Chopsticks restaurant in Redmond , Washington .
" I realized right away that they had no idea what they were doing , " he says .
Holkins and Krahulik were booking their own ads and charging " about 98 percent less than they should have been , " Khoo says .
They had signed away book publishing rights to a guy who moved to Alaska and refused to pay them .
They hooked up with a dubious Net company and nearly lost the rights to their intellectual property and the name Penny Arcade .
When Khoo met them , they were living off donations from readers and contemplating the prospect of day jobs again .
" Jerry and I are good at making comics and being funny … and that 's it , " Krahulik concedes .
Khoo coaxed them into a second meeting and presented them with a 50 - page business plan .
He offered to quit his analyst job and work for them free for two months .
" They should not have trusted me , " he says .
They did .
Holkins looks back in astonishment at what easy prey they would 've been for an unscrupulous person looking to get their hands on the business .
" Luckily , Robert perceived greater value in fixing us to the front of his chariot and riding us forever , " he says .
Khoo has created a successful business model that includes merchandising , creative services , and book publishing ( they 've recovered the rights ) .
But the centerpiece is online advertising .
A bell rings in the office , signaling that the Penny Arcade sales department has just closed another deal on a banner ad from a game publisher .
As with every ad that appears on the site , the potential advertiser first had to send over a copy of the game , and Holkins and Krahulik had to deem it worthy .
" There were fights about that at first .
We 'd swat down a $ 20 K buy that Robert had spent weeks working on , " Holkins says .
" But he quickly realized that our choosiness helps him . "
Listen : Tycho Brahe 's " My Belruel " https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/multimedia/magazine/1509/My_Belruel.mp3
Today , Penny Arcade Inc. makes almost half of its money from ads and more than a third from merchandising .
( Holkins and Krahulik refuse to disclose revenue , but it 's probably safe to say it 's in the low seven figures . )
Part of that comes from a lucrative sideline making ads for game publishers , including Ubisoft , Vivendi , and Blizzard .
" If we like a game , we can offer lots of cool services , " Holkins says .
He plays an MP3 of a song he 's created using a Nintendo DS game called Jam Sessions , which simulates an acoustic guitar .
It 's a hilarious , surprisingly melancholy ode to a murdered videogame character , and about the best advertisement for the guitar game imaginable .
Meanwhile , Krahulik and Kiko Villaseñor , the staff graphic designer , have decided on the logo for an upscale line of shirts , complete with collars and buttons .
Every year , they sell hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of T - shirts emblazoned with their characters and catchphrases .
" But not everyone works in a place where you can wear T - shirts , " Khoo says .
" Especially T - shirts that say boobies , which one of ours does . "
( That extremely popular item references the classic math - club gag of tapping out " 5,318,008 " on your calculator , then turning it upside down . )
The line of shirts , called First Party , wo n't feature any Penny Arcade references — just a simple joypad insignia stitched over the heart , like the polo player on a Ralph Lauren shirt or the crocodile on a Lacoste .
If the tiny status symbol is n't enough to coax fans into buying adult clothing , each garment will also come with a helpful pamphlet explaining the rules of fashion to sartorial n00bs .
The clearest evidence of the clout Holkins and Krahulik wield is the Penny Arcade Expo .
This year , 30,000 fans will descend on Seattle in late August and pay $ 45 a pop to attend the fourth edition of their annual convention .
PAX is the biggest gamer gathering in the country now that the Electronic Entertainment Expo has been drastically scaled back .
E3 became infamous for expensive demo booths pumping out trailers at deafening levels , chart - topping rock bands at lavish company - sponsored parties , and appearances by major movie stars flogging the game adaptations of their latest flicks .
The biggest publishers decided that the escalating expense of the event could not be justified , and last year they all dropped out .
PAX is n't geared to retailers and the media like E3 was ; it 's dedicated to entertaining hardcore gamers , the sort of people who like Penny Arcade .
" E3 was like a world 's fair , " says Josh Milligan , director of digital marketing for Ubisoft .
" PAX is like Woodstock . "
His company is a sponsor of PAX and will host a contest in which some lucky fan of the anime Naruto will win their weight in ramen .
Holkins and Krahulik will sit on discussion panels and emcee an epic cyber - tournament .
( Last year , the winner took home a Scion outfitted with an Xbox 360 .
This year , the grand prize is $ 5,000 and an all - expense - paid trip to the Tokyo Game Show , PAX 's only remaining rival . )

Crude oil prices last week were flirting with a record high .
It 's great news – for the Russians .
Low oil prices contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
In Russia today , high oil and natural gas prices are , to a large degree , the reason for an economic boom .
In the first quarter of this year , Russia 's economy steamed along at a level 7.9 percent above the same three months of 2006 .
Last year , Russia 's gross domestic product was up 7.8 percent , notes Charles Movit , an economist at PlanEcon , part of Global Insight , a consulting firm in Waltham , Mass .
Russia 's growth rate is not quite up to that of China .
But , as Mr. Movit puts it , the rate is " pretty enviable from a Western standpoint . "
With its massive exports of gas and oil ( at least $ 200 billion a year ) , Russia has considerable economic clout in Western Europe .
It supplies 40 percent of Germany 's natural gas , for instance .
" Russia is very strong , " says Marshall Goldman , an economist at Wellesley College in Massachusetts .
It may even be " stronger than in its history " – a view not widely shared by other Russia experts .
In November , the Brookings Institution will publish the English translation of " Collapse of an Empire : Lessons for Modern Russia , " now a bestseller in Russia .
Written by Yegor Gaidar , an economist who was Russia 's acting prime minister between 1991 and 1994 , the book uses information from Soviet archives to tell the story of the last few years of the Soviet Union .
It tries to shoot down the " myth " held by most Russians that the Soviet Union was " a dynamically developing world superpower until usurpers initiated disastrous reforms . "
It also warns that Russia should avoid the peril of another collapse in oil prices .
What happened , states Mr. Gaidar , is that Soviet grain production stagnated between 1966 and 1990 .
Meanwhile , 80 million people moved from farms to cities .
New Soviet output of oil and gas was not sufficiently expanded to provide the hard currency needed to buy grain abroad .
Eventually , the Soviets had to borrow foreign money to buy grain .
Mikhail Gorbachev , the last leader of the Soviet Union , told a meeting of the Communist Party , " We are buying [ the grain ] because we cannot survive without it , " noted Gaidar in a talk to the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) in Washington last fall .
An associate of Mr. Gorbachev had warned in March 1991 of the risk of famine in June if foreign grain was n't obtained .
The result was that Moscow could not suppress revolt in its empire – as it had done in earlier years in East Germany , Hungary , and Czechoslovakia – without losing Western loans .
Gaidar argues that if the Soviet military had crushed Solidarity Party demonstrations in Warsaw , " the Soviet Union would not have received the desperately needed $ 100 billion from the West . "
Similarly , when the Soviets tried to use force to reestablish control in the Baltic states in January 1991 , the reaction from the West , including the United States , was : " You can choose any solution , but please forget about the $ 100 billion credit . "
The Soviets backed down .
Oversimplifying history , Gorbachev was perceived as weak for allowing the dissolution of the Russian empire , overthrown in a military coup , and eventually replaced by Boris Yeltsin .
Gaidar 's thesis is n't accepted in its entirety by other experts .
Leon Aron , a fellow at the AEI and a friend of Gaidar , says glasnost – Gorbachev 's effort to bring openness and transparency into the activities of Soviet institutions , with greater freedom of information – opened the USSR to new political , ideological , and spiritual ideas .
" The economic side made collapse faster , " he says .
Goldman figures that Gorbachev 's dismantling of the Soviet military - industrial complex was the main cause of the collapse .
The aluminum industry , for example , supplied raw material for military aircraft , the steel industry for the 60,000 tanks facing the West .
Afterwards , " there was no longer anything there , " he says .
At its peak , the military absorbed 30 percent of total Soviet output .
Today , Russia spends about 5 percent on its military .
Of course , not all is shiny in Russia today .
The nation is not yet investing enough , says Stephen Cohen , a Russia expert at Princeton University in New Jersey .
Too much investment money held by the elite is fleeing abroad .
The World Bank says only 14 percent of Russians were living below the poverty level last year , compared with 30 percent in 1999 .
But Mr. Cohen says " an awful lot of people " are hit by a crumbling infrastructure , the privatization of government property after the Soviet Union 's collapse , and poor pensions , healthcare , and education .
Per capita income is a mere $ 10,600 a year , Movit reckons ( versus $ 22,000 in the US ) .
But Russia today has a budget surplus , a $ 112 billion " Stabilization Fund " to counter a big drop in oil and gas prices , and some $ 400 billion in its international reserves .
Unlike Rodney Dangerfield , Russia gets some respect nowadays .
I read my first book about the secret doings of the CIA in 1964 .
It was an eye - opener called The Invisible Government by David Wise and Thomas Ross .
They exposed the CIA 's overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran in 1953 and of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954 , its role at the Bay of Pigs operation in Cuba , against Sukarno in Indonesia , and covert operations in Laos and Vietnam .
From Random
House , the CIA secretly got hold of the book 's pre-publication galleys , and the director at the time , John McCone , demanded of Wise and Ross that they extensively delete .
They held their ground and Random House did , too , warning McCone that if the agency bought up all its books the way it had threatened to do , the publisher would have to put out a second edition .
So the CIA stuck with its backup plan , working to get bad reviews placed in various media .
Next week , according to this morning 's Washington Post , at the behest of CIA Director Michael Hayden the agency will release hundreds of newly declassified pages relating to agency secrets from the 1950s , '60s and ' 70s , including illegal abuses of its authority .
As the Post says , these are the " so - called ' family jewels ' documenting a quarter - century of overseas assassination attempts , domestic spying , kidnapping and infiltration of leftist groups from the 1950s to the 1970s ... "
Not to mention drug experiments on unsuspecting victims .
The documents , to be publicly released next week , also include accounts of break - ins and theft , the agency 's opening of private mail to and from China and the Soviet Union , wiretaps and surveillance of journalists , and a series of " unwitting " tests on U.S. civilians , including the use of drugs .
" Most of it is unflattering , but it is CIA 's history , " Hayden said in a speech to a conference of foreign policy historians .
The documents have been sought for decades by historians , journalists and conspiracy theorists and have been the subject of many fruitless Freedom of Information Act requests .
If McCone were still alive he 'd probably deep - six Hayden .
The folks at The National Security Archive , one of the most compelling places to visit in wwwLand , must be drooling .
The award - winning non-profit Archive based at George Washington University has been digging out classified documents for more than two decades through the Freedom of Information Act and has provided scholars and others with a wealth of information about government activity the powers - that - be would rather keep under wraps .
But the CIA 's airing of its dirty laundry is what , in the Watergate days , was called a " modified limited hang - out " of documents from a long while back , and there are unlikely to be any major new revelations .
We 'll never know what got shredded or disposed of in burn bags .
Still , the documents should add considerable detail to what was exposed by previous investigations .
Some of the juiciest material as reported by the Post relates to the " rising sense of panic " in the Gerald Ford Administration as newspaper accounts revealed " skeletons in the CIA 's closet . "
A New York Times article by reporter Seymour Hersh about the CIA 's infiltration of antiwar groups , published in December 1974 , was " just the tip of the iceberg , " then - Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger warned Ford , according to a Jan. 3 memorandum of their conversation .
Kissinger warned that if other operations were divulged , " blood will flow , " saying , " For example , Robert Kennedy personally managed the operation on the assassination of [ Cuban President Fidel ] Castro . "
Kennedy was the attorney general from 1961 to 1964 .
What may be of greatest interest is the CIA 's highly illegal domestic activities , including infiltration of antiwar , African - American and other activist organizations .
Not mentioned in the Post story is the fact that the first inklings of those activities were exposed in 1967 , when Robert Scheer , now at Truthdig.com , was writing for Ramparts magazine .
He uncovered the CIA 's infiltration and funding of the National Student Association to the tune of $ 400,000 a year .
What the CIA got for its money was that NSA students abroad would collect information about the personalities , habits and views of foreign student leaders and the goals and policies of their organizations .
The CIA documents scheduled for release next week , Hayden said yesterday , " provide a glimpse of a very different time and a very different agency . "
Barred by secrecy restrictions from correcting " misinformation , " he said , the CIA is at the mercy of the press .
" Unfortunately , there seems to be an instinct among some in the media today to take a few pieces of information , which may or may not be accurate , and run with them to the darkest corner of the room , " Hayden said .
Uh-huh .
Sure .
OK .
But we 'll have until a few more directors have sat at the helm of the CIA before more documents are declassified to tell us about drug- running , torture manuals and the like from the 1980s .
And still more directors before we get a glimpse of how different the agency is today than it was all those years ago when it slipped LSD into the drinks of unsuspecting citizens and toppled governments at will .

Some U.S. astronauts drink recycled urine , sweat , and bathwater in space ...
For NASA ’s # YearInSpace mission , astronauts had to spend a year at the International Space Station .
Since there ’s no water in space , the U.S. team survives on recycled moisture from the immediate environment , namely : the breath and sweat of the crew , shower runoff , and urine from animals on the station .
… and it ’s cleaner than drinking water !?
The ISS recycles 93 % of the liquids it receives .
It takes eight days to recycle , and a long purification process makes it cleaner than the water people drink at home .
This is one of the most disturbing yet surprising facts about space .
The International Space Station ( ISS ) is worth 1 billion US dollars .
It is also the largest manned object put into space .
Putting on a spacesuit takes 45 minutes .
This long process will ensure the maximum safety of the astronaut – any errors can be fatal .
A standard NASA spacesuit costs 12 million dollars .
As of 2017 , NASA experiences a suit shortage .
Only 11 suits are in use , with others built years ago .
Saturn is less dense than water .

Editor 's note : Roland S. Martin is a CNN contributor and a talk - show host for WVON - AM in Chicago .
Roland Martin says non-Catholic Christians should not be too concerned with proclamations of Pope Benedict XVI .
( CNN ) -- Non-Catholics who are up in arms of the proclamation by Pope Benedict XVI that the only true church in the world is that of Catholicism should n't even bother getting upset .
Just chalk it up to an old man trying to get a little attention .
For him to even suggest that only the Catholic Church can provide true salvation to believers in Christ shows that he is wholly ignorant of the Scriptures that I have known all my life .
Sorry , let me take that back .
I 've really only known the Bible for the last 13 of my 38 years .
That 's because those first 25 years were spent as a die - hard Catholic .
That 's right , I was born and raised in the Catholic Church .
One of the first meetings to build the church I was raised in -- Our Lady Star of the Sea in Houston -- took place in my grandparents ' living room .
Many of my Saturdays and Sundays were spent serving as an altar boy , Catholic Youth Organization leader , dedicated student of Catechism , and constantly reciting the Holy Rosary .
And the reality is that we were never really encouraged to study the Scriptures .
The standard practice was for all of us to read the same pamphlets passed out by the church , recite the readings from the New and Old Testaments , listen to the Scripture chosen for us in the Gospel and hear a normally bland homily .
That is n't always the case at some Catholic churches .
If you visit St. Sabina in Chicago , Father Michael Pfleger will surely have your soul jumping with his strong sermons and willingness to engage the community to get involved in direct action .
Yet as I reflect on my years as a Catholic , it pretty much was a wasted experience , as there was more identification with the church , and not with Christ .
And that 's why Pope Benedict XVI is meaningless , along with his decision to re-state the primacy of the Catholic Church .
This week , the pope released a document correcting interpretations of the Second Vatican Council , which some say modernized the church .
But for hardliners like Pope Benedict XVI , the liberals went too far in some of their declarations .
But what ticked folks off was his assertion in the 16 - page document by the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that the only denominations that can call themselves true churches are ones that can trace their roots back to Jesus Christ 's original apostles .
He even suggested they suffer from defects .
This is nothing but a naked attempt by Pope Benedict XVI to " own " Jesus by virtue of the Catholic Church considering the apostle Peter as its leader .
He refuses to acknowledge the reality that Jesus did n't consider a church to be most important .
What was ?
The Great Commission .
The Bible records in Matthew 28:16 that Jesus called his 11 disciples ( the other , Judas , hanged himself after betraying Jesus ) to Mount Galilee and decreed , " All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you .
And surely I am with you always , to the very end of the age . " ( New International Version ) .
It does n't matter what Pope Benedict XVI has to say , or for that matter , any other religious leader .
A Christian believes in Jesus Christ and what He had to say , not what a man of God has to say .
This is not an attempt to completely dismiss religious leaders , but is further evidence of what happens when ego is more important than the work of Christ .
John 14:6 says , " I am the way and the truth and the life .
No one comes to the Father except through me . "
Nowhere does it say that Peter , Pope Benedict XVI or anyone else can supplant Jesus as the leader of the church .
It is these kinds of missives by Pope Benedict XVI that do nothing to support or build the community of faith .
All it does is divide .
Protestant leaders :
Do n't buy into the foolishness .
Let Pope Benedict XVI keep running off at the mouth and making pointless declarations .
If you keep bringing good news to the poor , setting the captives free and assisting those who seek to know Jesus , then you 'll make more headway in doing the work of Jesus than any 16 - page document will .

All About Pope Benedict XVI • The Roman Catholic Church
Claim : Photograph shows a 12 - foot - long , 1000 - lb. hog dubbed ‘ Hogzilla . ’
Status : Multiple — see below .
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 2004 ]
Around these parts , they are calling it Hogzilla : a 12 - foot - long wild hog recently killed on a plantation and now quickly becoming a part of local legend .
Around these parts , they are calling it Hogzilla : a 12 - foot - long wild hog recently killed on a plantation and now quickly becoming a part of local legend .
The plantation ’s owner claims the hog weighed 1,000 pounds and had 9 - inch tusks .
But few people have actually seen the hog — the only proof being a photo that shows the dead beast hanging from a rope .
Chris Griffin and ‘ Hogzilla ’
Whether the hog ever actually existed or is some sort of Faulknerian myth , it has definitely been the topic of conversation in small towns across southern Georgia .
“ People just back up and ask ‘ Is it real ? ’
They ca n’t believe that there ’s a hog that big in the woods , ” said Drew White , who has a copy of the photo on display at an auto parts store in Tifton , about 17 miles away .
Chris Griffin said he killed the beast last month at the River Oak Plantation , where he is a hunting guide , and has been showing off the picture around this small farming community ever since .
The hog is nearly twice as long as the 6 - foot - tall Griffin , who is seen standing next to it in the photo .
“ They say ‘ Man , you look like a dwarf compared to that thing , ' ” he said Wednesday .
The picture is all Griffin has to back up his claims .
He and Ken Holyoak , owner of the plantation , buried the beast on the property and did not want to hassle with slaughtering it since the meat of large feral hogs is typically not very good .
Holyoak said he decided that the hog ’s head also was n’t worth keeping because it was too large to mount on a wall .
He said the head has the diameter of a tire on a compact car .
“ We had to lift him with a backhoe , ” he said .
No one maintains official records on hog kills in Georgia .
But Department of Natural Resources biologist Kent Kammermeyer , who helped write a booklet on feral - hog problems in the state , said he has never heard of one as large as Hogzilla .
Holyoak said the plantation ’s previous record was a 695 - pound hog shot several years ago .
Enough wild hogs roam Holyoak ’s plantation that he has made it a side business to allow people to hunt them , but he said “ Hogzilla ” was too big to let someone else shoot .
“ We killed it because we did n’t want to take a chance of him getting away .
Somebody else would have shot it , ” he said .
Feral hogs , popularly known as wild hogs , are domestic hogs that escaped from farms and began living off the land .
They lay waste to corn and peanut fields and deprive more than 100 species &mdash including squirrels and deer — of food .
“ It ’s a big problem and it ’s getting worse , ” Kammermeyer said .
“ If you have a lot of hogs , you ’re going to have problems .
Hogs are very aggressive .
They run deer off and they can be dangerous if wounded or cornered . ”
Holyoak said he had to climb into a deer stand a few years back to escape a raging hog that circled around for six hours , foaming at the mouth and snapping at branches .
“ They say bears get mad when you mess with their babies , ” Holyoak said .
“ Hogs do n’t need a reason to get mad and come after you . ”
Origins : The “ Hogzilla ”
photo that took the Internet by storm in the last week of July 2004 is an oddity in the world of online rumor , in that the presenting tale and its accompanying snapshot of a giant hog strung over a pit went unnoticed until the media popularized it .
Prior to its appearance on the web sites of CNN , Fox News , MSNBC and Yahoo !
News , the Associated Press article casting doubt on the veracity of a giant hog ’s being shot on a Georgia plantation had not circulated in cyberspace .
Datelined Alapaha , Georgia , the 28 July 2004 Associated Press article advised readers to remain somewhat skeptical of the tale because its writer had been unable to verify the size or weight of the hog , or indeed any of the other details given in the account .
Only
Hogzilla Float , Nov. 2004
two people supposedly saw the beast : its slayer , and the owner of the property where it was downed .
Chris Griffin , the hog ’s slayer , said he and Ken Holyoak , the owner of the River Oak Plantation , buried Hogzilla on the property .
The photograph was taken sometime in June 2004 near Alapaha , a town with a population of 682 .
Holyoak claimed that because he could n’t fit the huge animal in his freezer intact , and its meat was not suitable for eating , he and his crew decided to bury it instead .
He maintained they cut off the head ( described by Holyoak as “ about as big as a car tire ” ) and interred it separately from the rest of the hog ’s remains in an undisclosed location because they were feared someone would try to steal it .
Nonetheless , there was reason to doubt the claim of the hog ’s weighing a thousand pounds — not only are n’t feral hogs known to grow to that size , but one has to wonder how the killer of this particular ground - rooter came by the “ 1000 lbs. ” figure .
It ’s not as if folks routinely port about scales capable of weighing something that large , and according to the AP account , the hog was never dragged to any location where it could have been weighed .
Farm - raised hogs , however , have been known to grow to sizes even larger than that claimed of Hogzilla :
Darrell Anderson , CEO of the Lafayette , Ind. - based National Swine Registry , said farm - raised hogs grow as large as 1,300 pounds and measure as long as 7 feet along the backbone from head to tail .
“ If you hang them by their hind legs and you have the front legs stretching out , you ’ll get another four or five feet , ” he said .
Darrell Anderson , CEO of the Lafayette , Ind. - based National Swine Registry , said farm - raised hogs grow as large asand measure as long asalong the backbone from head to tail .
“ If you hang them by their hind legs and you have the front legs stretching out , you ’ll get another four or five feet , ” he said .
A hog that size would probably be 5 years old , he said .
The animals will grow tusks in the wild .
Domesticated , their tusks are trimmed because they are dangerous .
Although the photograph is real , it contains clues to a bit of exaggeration in the telling of this tale : the man pictured beside the strung - up hog is standing in an area that has been dug up .
Once one accounts for the remainder of the man ’s legs ( which are hidden from view in the pit ) and
mentally compares the complete figure with the suspended hog , the claim of the beast ’s being “ nearly twice as long as the 6 - foot - tall Griffin ” collapses , because the human figure comes up only a bit shorter than that of the felled animal .
Also , items placed in the foreground of photos tend to look larger than they are , and in this picture the man is standing to the rear of the hog .
The beast , therefore , looks bigger in comparison to the man than it would if the two had been snapped side by side .
Indeed , when the National Geographic Society sent a team of scientists to exhume Hogzilla , what they found was not a 12 - foot behemoth of a hog , but an animal they estimated had measured about 7 - 1/ 2 feet in length and weighed around 800 lbs. — a hybrid of wild boar and domestic Hampshire pig that the Atlanta Journal - Constitution described as “ large , perhaps even record - setting large , but not hide - the - children - and - get - your - guns large . ”
May 2007 brought both the announcement that an independent filmmaker was planning to produce a horror movie about the monster porker ( to be entitled The Legend of Hogzilla ) and the claim that an 11 - year - old Alabama boy had killed a hog even bigger than the renowned super swine :
According to various news reports , on 3 May 2007 near Delta , Alabama , 11 - year - old Jamison Stone used a pistol to shoot and kill a wild hog weighing a staggering 1,051 pounds and measuring an incredible 9 - feet - 4 from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail — measurements which , if documented , would make the creature considerably larger than Hogzilla .
Since then , much debate has raged about whether the photographs of the monster pig were genuine , whether the creature was really as big as claimed , and whether the animal was truly feral rather than a domesticated hog that had been raised as a pet and had only recently been released into a hunting preserve ( where Jamison shot it ) .
At the MonsterPig web site wet up to publicize Jamison ’s feat , the boy ’s father now says :
The news media used [ the pig ] for headlines for a week , claiming its size was a hoax .
On the evening of May 31 , I was contacted by Bran Strickland of the Anniston Star and he told me that he had good news and bad news .
He said that the good news is your claims about the pig ’s massive size have been verified .
The bad news is that he came from a hog breeder and that the pig had been sold from the breeder to the preserve for the purpose of hunting .
Early on the morning of June 1 , I went to the computer and read Bran ’s article which portrayed the pig as a family pet .
The pig that Jamison killed did not act like a family pet .
It was a very aggressive animal .
I was upset at first to read this report but after going through a week of being told what we killed did not exist by the network media , I decided to get to the bottom of this myself .
I got my whole family up at 6:00 a.m. and traveled to Heflin , AL to meet with the Blissitts to give Phil Blissitt , whom I have never met or talked to before , the opportunity to explain to Jamison why he had sold a pig that was described as being so gentle and sweet to a hunting preserve in order for someone to come and kill it .

In which I consider the latest example of Richard Stallman ’s utter lack of human empathy .
Dramatis Personæ
Richard M. Stallman ( RMS ) founder of the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation , head developer of GNU Emacs , etc. , etc. , etc. Stefan Monnier Professeur adjoint , Université de Montréal , and Emacs developer Luc Teirlinck Professor , Auburn University , and Emacs developer Nick Roberts Emacs developer
Act I
Luc proposes a small change to Emacs :
I propose to change paragraph - start in Shell mode and Ielm [ … ]
I can install if desired .
After some discussion , the change is made , but problems with the change are soon discovered .
( You can read the whole thread over at gmane if you ’re interested in the technical details , which are irrelevant to my purpose here . )
RMS sensibly decides that reverting the change is best , and asks Stefan to implement :
This is very disturbing news .
There are only two ways out of this squeeze : to back up to the previous consistent design , or move forward to a new one .
One advantages in moving back is that we know where the changes would have to be made .
We do n’t know all the places that would have to be changed to move forward .
Since the change was not made intentionally , and since there is no great advantage in this alteration in the specifications of paragraph - start , I think it is best if we move back .
Stefan , can you work on that ?
Stefan is very understandably busy with his new daughter , and thus ca n’t help just now :
I just got a baby girl and am kind of swamped .
RMS fails to offer the customary congratulations , or in fact any amount of human understanding :
I am sorry to hear it .
Unless someone else can figure these things out , I guess the release has to wait until you have time .
[ Emphasis mine . ]
Now at this point you might assume that RMS is only disappointed that Stefan does n’t have the time to work on Emacs , and that he ’s not disappointed in Stefan ’s particular reason .
Such an assumption would be mistaken .
Nick very reasonably offers Stefan the opposite sentiment :
Congratulations , Stefan !
I suggest that you spend any spare time with your daughter as she will grow up before you know it .
Emacs , on the other hand , will still be around after she has left home .
RMS believes he did n’t make himself sufficiently clear before , and expounds upon his earlier callousness :
It does n’t take special talents to reproduce — even plants can do it .
On the other hand , contributing to a program like Emacs takes real skill .
That is really something to be proud of .
It helps more people , too .
Finis .
Commentary
I ’m not even sure where to start with this one .
Yes , I realize that RMS most likely suffers from a fairly extreme form of Asperger ’s syndrome , and as such is probably quite unaware of how offensive he is .
But seriously people , it ’s not hard to treat other people with respect .
In fact , it ’s pretty easy .
And this is by no means an isolated incident ; the history of the free software movement is littered with good people parting ways with RMS over behavior like this .
I hope that Stefan continues to contribute to Emacs , but I would certainly understand it if he quits .
Addendum 1
After alerting the kind folks in #emacs to this post , bojohan pointed me to this 1993 flame from RMS on the common practice of posting birth announcements to mailing lists ( emphasis mine ) :
Could people please not use this list to announce information of no particular interest to the people on the list ?
Hundreds of thousands of babies are born every day .
While the whole phenomenon is menacing , one of them by itself is not newsworthy .
Nor is it a difficult achievement — even some fish can do it .
( Now , if you were a seahorse , it would be more interesting , since it would be the male that gave birth . ) [… ]
These birth announcements also spread the myth that having a baby is something to be proud of , which fuels natalist pressure , which leads to pollution , extinction of wildlife , poverty , and ultimately mass starvation .
I wonder if RMS is a member of the Church of Euthanasia , who encourage us all to save the planet ; kill yourself .
Addendum 2
Here ’s an example going all the way back to 1978 , replying to the hoopla over the first mass , unsolicted , commercial email , the very first spam ( emphasis his ) :
In a rare interview with a British newspaper , President Lula told the Guardian that Brazil , a fast developing country whose support is critical to a global deal on emission cuts , had not even been informed that Mr Bush was contemplating a new negotiating framework , before the US president made his announcement last Thursday .
" The Brazilian position is clear cut , " Mr Lula said .
" I cannot accept the idea that we have to build another group to discuss the same issues that were discussed in Kyoto and not fulfilled .
" If you have a multilateral forum [ the UN ] that makes a democratic decision ... then we should work to abide by those rules [ rather than ] simply to say that I do not agree with Kyoto and that I will develop another institution , " said Mr Lula , who was in London to watch Friday 's England - Brazil international football friendly .
The Bush administration has sought to cultivate President Lula as an ally , seeing the former trade unionist as a centre - left alternative in Latin America to the more radical anti-American socialism espoused by Cuba 's Fidel Castro and Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez .
Presidents Bush and Lula also share an enthusiasm for the potential for " bio- fuels " made from plants as a substitute for fossil fuels .
However , on overall climate change policy , President Lula was dismissive of the Bush approach , calling it " voluntarism " , meaning a reliance on " coalitions of the willing " rather than establish global institutions and the pursuit of voluntary goals rather than binding commitments .
" We can not let voluntarism override multilateralism , " he said .
President Bush said last week that he wanted Brazil and other rapidly developing countries to join rich nations in what he called a " new framework " to curb greenhouse gas emissions as an alternative to the planned UN process .
He said that later this year he would convene a series of meetings of the 15 nations that produced most greenhouse gas emissions .
But Mr Lula , Brazil 's president since 2003 , rebuked Mr Bush for seemingly sidestepping the UN and not taking its global responsibilities seriously .
" I am open - minded about talking to President Bush ... I will never refuse to discuss any idea , but we should respect the decisions made in the multilateral forums .
It is the only thing we have all agreed on in a democratic way , " he said .
" If the US is the country that most contributes with greenhouse gases , in the world , it should assume more responsibility to reduce emissions . "
The German hosts of this week 's G8 summit at Heiligendamm have also flatly rejected the idea of creating a separate process to deal with climate change .
Chancellor Angela Merkel called it " non-negotiable " .
Tony Blair has been a lonely voice on the world stage , hailing the Bush plan as an " important step forward " .
President Lula will be one of five leaders of rapidly developing countries to join the G8 leaders in Germany , where he will champion Brazil 's global leadership in the use of plant - derived ethanol for fuel .
His promotion of bio-fuels has brought criticism from Mr Chavez , the continent 's leading oil producer and Castro , who has argued that growing bio-fuels is equivalent to taking food crops from the mouths of the poor and putting it in the petrol tanks of the wealthy .
Mr Lula picked his words on his fellow presidents carefully .
" Its normal that those countries that have oil feel a bit strange about this idea of bio- fuels , " he said , but he suggested it was time for the Latin American left to move beyond its instinctive anti-Americanism .
" A long time ago I learned not to put the blame for backwardness in Brazil on the US , " he said .
" We have to blame ourselves .
Our backwardness is caused by an elite which for a century did n't think about the majority and subordinated itself to foreign interests . "
Asked about the global legacy left by the Tony Blair , who has highlighted his own efforts to improve aid and trade conditions for developing countries , President Lula had little to say .
" I did n't have much contact with prime minister Tony Blair , " he noted .
President Lula said the decisive moment in the current " Doha round " of talks would come in the next few weeks , with the G8 summit at a trade ministers ' meeting due in mid-June .
" I think that this month something has to happen .
If nothing happens , we will go into history as a generation of politicians that failed humanity , especially the poor , " the president said .
" If there is no agreement on Doha round , it 's useless to talk about fighting terrorism , its useless to fight organised crime because poverty is the principal seed for the growth of terrorism . "
The only more important issue in the world than trade , President Lula said , is climate change , and both are nearing a potential turning point .
" In the Doha round , I want to solve the issues of today and tomorrow , " the Brazilian leader said .
" On the climate issue I have to solve the problem of planet earth , the only one we know of on which we can survive ...
So for God 's sake , let 's take care of planet earth . "
A : When you ’re selling one in Alabama .
According to a federal court decision announced yesterday ( Valentine ’s Day ! ) , it ’s perfectly fine for the state of Alabama to criminalize the sale of sex toys .
Just to put this in context — 41 years after the Supreme Court decided it was unconstitutional to restrict the sale of condoms , the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit thinks it ’s fine for Alabama to jail ( up to one year for first violation ) or fine ( up to $ 50,000 ) anyone who gets caught selling as much as a dildo .
( PDF of the statue is here . )
I do n’t think anyone would argue that there is any harm worth criminalizing in selling sex toys to adults .
No one ’s being forced to do anything , there ’s no economic harm , no harm to children .
But the Attorney General of Alabama told the court that the law barring sales preserved “ public morality , ” and was , therefore , constitutional .
The AG ’s “ public morality ” argument might have held up in 1999 , but in 2003 , the Supreme Court held , in Lawrence v. Texas , “ the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice . ”
And that , one would have thought , was that .
If public morality alone is n’t a sufficient reason for a law , then a law making it illegal to sell sex toys just has to be unconstitutional , yes ?
Well , no .
The Court of Appeals decided that the Lawrence holding only applied to private behavior .
So Alabama could n’t make it illegal to own or use sex toys .
But it can make it illegal to sell them .
The court decided that selling sex toys was like prostitution , a commercial , public activity that can be punished under the law .
Let ’s get back to my opening question , comparing the sale of guns with the sale of vibrators .
Alabama is one of the easiest places in the US to buy a gun .
There are no state laws requiring licensing , registration , child safety locks , a mandatory waiting period or a limit on the number of weapons that can be purchased at any one time .
Maybe that ’s one of the reasons Alabama has the 4th highest homicide rates in the US .
So let ’s take a look at Alabama ’s moral restrictions on commerce .
Someone sells ten assault rifles to a 16 year old who just walks into the shop without proof of parental permission ?
Perfectly alright .
Someone sells a rubber duckie vibrator to a 40 year old woman at a sex - toy party in the buyer ’s home ?
Better close the shades .

When Senator John McCain appeared at the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth last October as the presumptive next president of the US , the stars seemed fixed in the firmament for him .
The myth of McCain appeared as invincible as ever .
His war story - a bomber pilot shot down over North Vietnam in 1967 , held prisoner for five years and tortured - is the basis of his legend as morally courageous , authentic , unwavering in his convictions , an independent reformer willing to take on the reactionaries of his own party , an " American maverick " as he calls himself in his campaign autobiography .
The titles of his books reflect the image : Character Is Destiny , Why Courage Matters , and Faith of My Fathers .
Defeat at the hands of George Bush in the battle for the Republican nomination in 2000 , in which he was subjected to dirty tricks , completed his canonisation .
The press corps so venerated him that he called them " my base " .
McCain 's political colleagues , however , know another side of the action hero - a volatile man with a hair - trigger temper , who shouted at Senator Ted Kennedy on the Senate floor to " shut up " , and called fellow Republican senators " shithead ... fucking jerk ... asshole " .
A few months ago , McCain suddenly rushed up to a friend of mine , a prominent Washington lawyer , at a social event , and threatened to beat him up because he represented a client McCain happened to dislike .
Then , just as suddenly , profusely and tearfully , he apologised .
Many Republicans who have had dealings with McCain distrust him ( not just conservatives but traditional Republican moderates too ) .
While taking rightwing positions on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage , his simmering resentment of Bush led him virtually to caucus with the Democrats in early 2001 ( before September 11 ) .
Then , abruptly , he rushed to embrace Bush .
McCain 's political advisers believe that he would easily be elected president in 2008 , but fear that he might not capture the nomination .
In 2000 he did not win a primary state where the voting was restricted to Republicans .
So McCain decided to let the election take care of itself as he won over the party faithful .
He campaigned enthusiastically for Bush in 2004 .
He sought to reconcile with the religious right , whose leaders he had called " agents of intolerance " in 2000 .
McCain had belatedly taken the lead in opposing Bush 's torture policy , an issue that could not be more personal for him .
But after the supreme court last year declared Bush 's secret tribunals for detainees and use of extreme interrogation techniques illegal , the president sought congressional approval of his version .
At first , McCain fought Bush , but the right attacked him .
McCain quickly capitulated , even agreeing to suspension of habeas corpus .
Someone close to him explained to me that McCain calculated he could continue to play the issue when he became chairman of the Senate armed services committee in the next Congress .
Asked about the chance that the Democrats might take control , McCain declared : " I think I 'd just commit suicide . "
As the neoconservatives abandoned Bush 's sinking ship , McCain welcomed them aboard .
" McCain began reading the Weekly Standard and conferring with its editors , particularly Bill Kristol , " the New Republic magazine reported .
And he hired a board member of the neocon Project for the New American Century , Randy Scheunemann , as his foreign - policy aide .
McCain positioned himself as consistently belligerent , even to Bush 's right : in favour of bombing Iran and North Korea .
He also proposed a " surge " of troops into Iraq , an idea gleaned from the neocons .
If Bush had adopted the Iraq Study Group approach of diplomacy and redeployment , which McCain had assailed as " dispiriting " , the right would have hailed McCain as a prophet with honour .
However , importuned by the same neocons who had sold it to McCain , Bush seized upon the " surge " .
McCain had trapped himself .
He is now chained to Bush .
As Bush 's war has escalated , McCain 's popularity has nose dived .
Still the frontrunner for the Republican nomination , he might have made himself more acceptable to the base , but his political strategy has shattered his myth .
Bearing the burden of Bush , he may have become unelectable .

A CALL TO ACTION BY WE THE PEOPLE
Dear Minneapolis citizens ,
Please take 2 minutes to contact your city councilperson and ask him / her to support and pass a resolution for the impeachment of Bush and Cheney .
During the June 13th forum with speakers from ImpeachforPeace.org , Cam Gordon , Green Party City Councilman explained the strategic process for making it more feasible to get the Impeachment Resolution on the City Council agenda .
If we inundate the city council with phone calls and emails every day , they will realize there is a strong grassroots movement of constituents behind this issue .
Until then , they will simply believe that there are more important things to deal with ( like the victimization of the poor ) .
Resolutions have already passed in 75 cities , 23 statewide and national political committees , the state legislature in Vermont and has been introduced in 9 state legislatures and 17 state legislatures are considering introducing impeachment resolutions .
Some local elected officials may claim that this is a federal issue , but the policies made by the current administration are reducing our LGA ( Local Government Aid ) which we see affecting our local services .
Including unfunded promises made for Medicare , Social Security , and Federal retirement programs , US taxpayers now have a total debt of $ 59 TRILLION .
That ’s $ 516,000 for every US household .

Here are the 10 reasons for impeachment :
Ten Reasons to Impeach George Bush and Dick Cheney
I ask Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney for the following reasons :
1. Violating the United Nations Charter by launching an illegal “ War of Aggression ” against Iraq without cause , using fraud to sell the war to Congress and the public , misusing government funds to begin bombing without Congressional authorization , and subjecting our military personnel to unnecessary harm , debilitating injuries , and deaths .
2. Violating U.S. and international law by authorizing the torture of thousands of captives , resulting in dozens of deaths , and keeping prisoners hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross .
3. Violating the Constitution by arbitrarily detaining Americans , legal residents , and non-Americans , without due process , without charge , and without access to counsel .
4. Violating the Geneva Conventions by targeting civilians , journalists , hospitals , and ambulances , and using illegal weapons , including white phosphorous , depleted uranium , and a new type of napalm .
5. Violating U.S. law and the Constitution through widespread wiretapping of the phone calls and emails of Americans without a warrant .
6. Violating the Constitution by using “ signing statements ” to defy hundreds of laws passed by Congress .
7. Violating U.S. and state law by obstructing honest elections in 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , and 2006 .
8. Violating U.S. law by using paid propaganda and disinformation , selectively and misleadingly leaking classified information , and exposing the identity of a covert CIA operative working on sensitive WMD proliferation for political retribution .
9. Subverting the Constitution and abusing Presidential power by asserting a “ Unitary Executive Theory ” giving unlimited powers to the President , by obstructing efforts by Congress and the Courts to review and restrict Presidential actions , and by promoting and signing legislation negating the Bill of Rights and the Writ of Habeas Corpus .
10 . Gross negligence in failing to assist New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina , in ignoring urgent warnings of an Al Qaeda attack prior to Sept. 11 , 2001 , and in increasing air pollution causing global warming .

Law enforcement officials have accused Craigslist of enabling prostitution .
But the company ’s president , Jim Buckmaster , said its 24 - member staff cannot patrol the multitude of constantly changing listings — some 20 million per month — and counts on viewers to flag objectionable ads , which are promptly removed .
“ We do not want illegal activity on the site , ” he said .
Asked whether the company supported the police ’s placing decoy ads on Craigslist , Mr. Buckmaster said : “ We do n’t comment on the specifics ” of law enforcement .
Craig Newmark , the site ’s founder and chairman , deferred all questions to Mr. Buckmaster .
The police have also occasionally turned to Craigslist to trace stolen goods offered for sale or make drug arrests .
In June , in Nassau , spotting code words like “ snow ” or “ skiing ” to refer to cocaine , they set up a sting with an undercover officer to arrest a man who advertised cocaine for sex .
Experts say that under the federal Communications Decency Act of 1996 , the ads are legal and Web site owners are exempt from responsibility for content posted by users .
Craigslist , for example , last fall won dismissal of a suit that alleged housing discrimination in ads posted on its Web site .
“ You hold the speaker liable , not the soapbox , ” explained Kurt B. Opsahl , senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a digital civil liberties group based in San Francisco .
While Mr. Buckmaster said Craigslist was no different from old - media publications that have long carried sex - oriented ads , law enforcement officials say its scope and format are especially useful to the sex industry .
With listings for some 450 cities around the world , Craigslist claims to have 25 million users and 8 billion page views a month .
Posting advertisements , except those in the employment and some housing categories , is free , as is responding to them by e-mail .
“ The Internet has allowed people to make contact in a way not possible before , ” said Ronald Weitzer , a sociology professor at George Washington University and a researcher on prostitution .
“ Ten years ago this was not happening at all . ”
As Nassau ’s district attorney , Kathleen Rice , said of Craigslist : “ It ’s as easy as it gets . ”
Tracy Quan , a member of the advocacy group Prostitutes of New York and author of the autobiographical novel “ Diary of a Married Call Girl ” ( Harper Perennial , 2006 ) , acknowledged that “ the Internet became a virtual street for people in the sex industry , ” but said that “ the police are as inventive and as wily as sex workers are . ”
She said that the stings amounted to entrapment of consenting adults , and that “ it seems like an enormous waste of time resources by authoritarian busybodies . ”
SEATTLE , Washington ( CNN ) --
The FBI wants to question two men who were described as behaving oddly on a Washington state ferry earlier this summer .
The FBI wants to speak with these two men seen on a ferry in Washington state earlier this summer .
Members of the public and ferry workers reported the men to authorities after the two were seen pacing in areas of the boat , including a cargo hold , as if trying to measure distances , FBI Special Agent Larry Carr said Tuesday .
The men were also seen about two months ago taking photographs of the ferries -- including restricted areas -- and studying an emergency evacuation poster .
The men were spotted on multiple ferries and ferry routes , Carr said .
The FBI wants to question the men to determine if their behavior was harmless or whether they were surveilling the ferries and ferry terminals for nefarious purposes .
A ferry worker snapped photos of the men using a cell phone camera and gave the stills to law enforcement .
The photos were shown to police and ferry workers , but no one could identify the men , so authorities called on the public for help .
Pictures of the men have appeared in media outlets for more than a week .
None of the 200 tips that have come in so far has led investigators to the men .
Some news organizations have refused to publish the photos , saying the men have not been accused of a crime .
It appears the men could be of Middle Eastern origin .
Although the initial FBI news release on the men did not discuss their possible ethnicity , " We just want to ensure that there is just one standard being implemented for suspicious behavior for both people who appear to be Middle Eastern and those who appear not to be Middle Eastern , " said Naseem Tuffaha of the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee .
Carr said the FBI made the photos public because " the result of not doing anything at that point in time is a ferry blowing up and thousands of people losing their lives .
We ca n't let that happen . "
More than 25,000 people commute daily through the Seattle Ferry Terminal and more than 9 million people travel through the terminal annually , according to the Washington State Department of Transportation web site .
But various FBI officials have stressed the agency is acting out of an abundance of caution and that the men seen on the ferry could have a logical and harmless explanation for what they were doing .
Robbie Burroughs , also with the FBI in Seattle , said the ferry system could be an attractive target to terrorists .
" Here the ferries are the equivalent of subways , so we are cautious , " Burroughs said last week when the effort to identify the men began .
Since the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , U.S. law enforcement has emphasized the need for the public to report suspicious behavior .
Many such reports turn out to be nothing of concern .
However , seizures of al Qaeda materials overseas have turned up reconnaissance photos taken in the United States .

Marguerite Grimmond came to Scotland when she was two
Marguerite Grimmond was born in Detroit but moved to Arbroath with her Scottish mother when she was two .
At the beginning of May she left Scotland for the first time for a holiday in Australia .
But when she returned , officials said her American passport was not valid and that she could not stay in the country .
The immigration officers said Mrs Grimmond , who had never applied for British citizenship , should have had her passport stamped by the Home Office before she set off on her holiday .
I do n't know anyone in America .
I would just be fair lost , to put it mildly
Marguerite Grimmond
They told her she would only be able to stay in Scotland for a further four weeks , after which time she was legally required to return to America .
Mrs Grimmond and husband Dave , from Kirriemuir , Angus , contacted their solicitors , and have now sent off a cheque for £ 750 along with an application to become a naturalised British citizen .
But with only five days to go before the deadline to leave the country , Mrs Grimmond was still waiting to hear whether her application had been successful .
She said : " I 've been an illegal immigrant , would you believe , but I 've paid taxes and done all the things I ought to do .
" My mother was Scottish , I married a Scottish policeman , my children were all born in Scotland so I assumed I was a Scot too .
I was n't aware that I was n't a British citizen .
" I have five days left until I could be tossed out of the country .
I 'm not terribly pleased about that .
" I do n't know anyone in America .
I would just be fair lost , to put it mildly , but I really do n't think there 's any more I can do .
I do n't think it will happen but I 'm just leaving it in the lap of the gods . "
' Commendable efficiency '
When Mrs Grimmond decided to take her first ever foreign holiday , she went to the American consulate and paid £ 70 for her passport .
She claimed that no - one mentioned that she would need to get the passport stamped by the Home Office , and was able to travel freely from Heathrow Airport to Sydney on 1 May .
She added : " I arrived back at Heathrow at the end of the holiday to be told by an official that I could n't stay in the country because I did n't have the Home Office stamp .
" Another more senior official then came along and said he would allow me to stay for a month . "
Her husband added : " This fiasco shows a commendable efficiency in detecting illegal immigrants - even an 80 - year - old lady . "
A spokesman for the Home Office said he could not comment on individual cases , adding : " All applications made to the Border and Immigration Agency are considered on a case - by - case basis . "

Look what £ 170,000 can buy you
The former janitor 's storeroom measures 11ft by 7ft and has a cupboard place for a shower and kitchenette area .
Potential buyers can expect to fork out an extra £ 30,000 to make the room habitable as there is no lighting and it is full of rubble .
Even the estate agent selling the property admitted the flat was " incredibly depressing " .
" We have to go in with a torch because the lights do not work and it is full of rubble , " Jason North , associate director at Lane Fox .
Nevertheless , the flat is expected to attract buyers due to its close proximity to the fashionable bars , shops and leisure facilities of Kensington and Chelsea .
In fact , the £ 170,000 price tag may make it one of the few affordable properties in what is London 's and the UK 's costliest borough .
According to research from property website Rightmove , released on Monday , the average asking price for a house in Kensington & Chelsea in January was £ 1,145,791 .
Many techniques promise to mitigate global warming — planting forests , nuclear power , bioethanol , and cars with better gas mileage , to name a few .
The problem is so enormous and the potential adverse effects so disturbing that we may have to simultaneously implement all available solutions to make the slightest dent in rising carbon dioxide levels .
Unfortunately , we are often slaves to preconceived notions such as “ complex problems require complex solutions . ”
Take the surprising trade - offs between even the most technologically advanced solar panel and plain white paint .
Which product would make you a better environmental citizen ?
To arrive at an answer , consider the following :
Our sun illuminates the earth with a steady 1,350 watts per square meter .
Some of this energy is absorbed by the atmosphere , some is reflected back into space , and some makes it to the earth ’s surface , where it might be absorbed or reflected as well .
A black earth , like a black leather car interior , would be very hot indeed .
Fortunately , white clouds , polar ice caps , and even deserts keep the earth ’s average reflectivity [ “ albedo ” to planetary scientists ] at around 30 % — giving our planet more of a beige leather interior , so to speak .
Degrees and Watts
Countering this reflective system are greenhouse gases like CO and methane .
These now retain an additional 2 watts per square meter of solar energy over and above retention levels in preindustrial times .
Such gases are disproportionately effective at capturing heat despite what actually remains a relatively small atmospheric concentration of 380 parts per million of CO .
That minute increase in retained heat is fairly inconsequential if you are baking cookies in an oven .
But for the earth as a whole , it ’s of critical importance , as the resulting extra few degrees is sufficient to melt the polar ice caps .
In this context , imagine a solar photovoltaic panel .
Unlike burning coal or oil , the production of photovoltaic electricity does not add to the stock of global warming gases permeating our atmosphere .
The panel ’s surface is pitch black — all the better to absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity .
On average , a panel that ’s 1 square meter in size will receive 300 watts of sunlight over a 24 - hour period .
In turning that sunlight into electricity , about 80 % of that energy is lost due to the inefficient conversion process .
But if the remaining 20 % is used to replace the equivalent amount of fossil fuel needed to produce that electricity , the result would be equivalent to eliminating — every single day — a square - meter column of CO gas extending from earth to outer space .
Put another way , each day that one panel would offset the equivalent of those extra 2 watts of global warming per square meter of earth we discussed earlier .
Moreover , the effect would be cumulative : 4 fewer watts of global warming the second day , 6 fewer the third , and so on .
A Panel Discussion
But here ’s the rub .
If , instead of a black solar panel absorbing light and producing electricity , you simply painted that square meter white , it would reflect back into outer space perhaps 50 of the 300 watts incident from the sun .
So it would take about 25 days for the solar panel to catch up with the more efficient reflection of sunlight that the white - painted panel would provide in a single day .
This seems counterintuitive , of course , as solar panels are net - positive in reducing global warming .
And , in many cases , you could install the black solar panel on an existing black building roof , so you would n’t be “ adding ” yet another black , heat - absorbing surface [ another “ albedo - decreaser ” ] to the earth .
Except for the small issue of money .
A 20 % - efficient , 1 - square - meter solar panel costs about $ 1,000 .
For $ 1,000 , you can buy 40 cans of good quality white paint .
Each can covers 2,000 square meters with a nice bright reflecting film .
So for the same $ 1,000 investment you could buy one square meter of photovoltaic cells , or cover 2,000 square meters with white paint .
It would take more than 2,000 times 25 days , or about a century , for the CO mitigation from $ 1,000 of solar panels to catch up with the albedo increase of a large painted roof !
Dollars and Sense
So what ’s a conscientious environmentalist to do ?
Unquestionably , we need solar panels for electricity .
You ca n’t run a washing machine on white paint .
But , for every dollar spent on solar panels , we should spend at least a dime on white paint for every roof , parking lot , and road in the country .
It offers a bigger , faster , and surer contribution to global warming reduction than more photovoltaic cells .
And it would save on fuel costs .
One estimate puts the annual national energy cost savings of more reflective roofs at $ 750 million , not including similar savings for lighter roads and parking lots .
Perhaps such white roofs and parking lots deserve an energy subsidy from Congress .
Perhaps white paint deserves to be traded on the carbon exchanges .
Perhaps white will become the new green .

What appears as clear sky around a cloud as seen from the ground through a digital camera ( left ) actually has a twilight zone of light - reflecting particles around it ( right ) .
To see this , the blue light from the atmosphere in the original image is first subtracted ( middle ) .
The twilight zone is revealed after the darker parts of the image are enhanced ( right ) .
An extensive and previously unknown “ twilight zone ” of particles in the atmosphere could complicate scientists ’ efforts to determine how much the Earth 's climate will warm in the future , a new study finds .
In addition to greenhouse gases , which absorb infrared radiation , or heat , emitted from Earth ’s surface and send it back to the ground , cloud droplets and aerosols , such as dust and air pollutants , in the atmosphere also affect the planet ’s temperature .
The exact overall effect of these two types of particles is still uncertain : while clouds block incoming solar radiation , water vapor also acts as a greenhouse gas , trapping heat like a blanket .
Now , recent satellite observations have found a zone of “ in - between particles ” in the air around clouds that was previously considered clear .
“ The area around clouds has given us trouble , ” said study team member Lorraine Remer of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. “ The instruments detected something there , but it did n’t match our understanding of what a cloud or an aerosol looked like .
What we think we ’re seeing is a transitional zone where clouds are beginning to form or are dying away , and where humidity causes dry particles to absorb water and get bigger . ”
Scientists have been aware of an indistinct “ halo ” surrounding individual clouds , but the newly detected zone is much more extensive , taking up as much as 60 percent of the atmosphere previously labeled as cloud - free .
The previously unknown ingredient in the atmospheric mixture of particles will have to be factored into models that try to predict how the atmosphere influences the change of global temperatures .
“ The effects of this zone are not included in most computer models that estimate the impact of aerosols on climate , ” said lead author Ilan Koren of the Weizmann Institute of Science , in Israel .
“ This could be one of the reasons why current measurements of this effect do n’t match our model estimates . ”
The study was published in the April 18 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
Is Los Angeles ready for the 250 - square - foot apartment ?
That ’s what city planning officials have in mind with a series of sweeping new zoning proposals that would allow developers to build smaller condos and apartments than ever before .
The tiny units -- studios that officials hope would be as small as 250 square feet -- are part of a package of proposed zoning changes aimed at significantly increasing density in downtown L.A .
The rules would apply to the roughly five miles around downtown but could eventually be extended elsewhere in the city .
The idea is to encourage developers to continue to build high - rises downtown even as the market appears poised to slow down -- while also spurring them to build units that are more affordable .
Supporters -- who include the city ’s top planning officials , some developers and Councilwoman Jan Perry , whose district includes downtown -- say the rules will encourage the construction of housing at a time when the city desperately needs it .

“ This is a landmark event , ” said Dan Rosenfeld , a principal in the development firm Urban Partners , which is behind several downtown projects .
“ The people who care about downtown L.A. have been waiting for these ordinances for a long time . ”
But the proposal -- slated to come before the City Council next week -- is already drawing criticism from those who see it as another effort to boost development in a region that is already in a high - rise building boom stretching from downtown through Koreatown and into Century City , Westwood and Marina del Rey .
Some land - use experts question whether there is much of a market for tiny apartments in downtown L.A. , which , despite its recent resurgence , still lacks the cachet of Manhattan , central London or Paris .
Others fear overcrowding and slum conditions if the market goes sour and the units are too densely packed .
“ I see it as creating a neighborhood where parking is horrendous and families are squeezing themselves into these units which are very small because they are affordable , ” said Noreen McClendon , a developer of affordable housing .
“ It ’s just a tenement . ”

The tiny apartment is a fairly new concept in Southern California , which has a long history of suburban sprawl and larger spaces .
But in New York , Boston , San Francisco and many European and Asian cities , residents have squeezed into tiny apartments for decades , usually because the lure of the downtown area is so great -- and the prices for larger places so high .
Gretchen Broussard , who co-owns Tiny Living , a Manhattan store that sells furnishings for small spaces , lived in a 200 - square - foot apartment in that New York borough until five years ago .
“ I could n’t even turn around in the space , ” Broussard said .
“ I maxed out every inch of the wall space , mounted everything to get it off the floor ... “

In San Francisco , Martin Eng rents a 300 - square - foot studio in the swanky Nob Hill neighborhood , across from the Ritz - Carlton hotel .
Though Eng has several other homes around the state , the apartment is his primary residence -- and he said it ’s livable only because it has a good view and plenty of light .
With a rent - controlled cost of $ 400 a month -- below the market rate -- the studio is a convenient city crash pad for Eng , 53 , who works in investment .
“ Mine is a tiny place , not somewhere you would want to entertain or bring people , ” Eng said .
“ It ’s like a poor man penthouse -- you ca n’t really be proud of it . ”
Although the new L.A. ordinance does not directly address the size of the apartments that could be built , it would remove all restrictions on the number of units that developers could put in a single building , a move that planners hope will result in residences as small as 250 square feet -- about the size of a hotel room or a modest living room .
Advertisement
The ordinance would also let developers willing to reserve some apartments for low - and moderate - income families to make their buildings 35 % bigger than zoning rules normally allow and to opt out of providing half the open space typically required .
Those who build units for those with very low incomes would not have to offer parking spaces for those residences .
Perry said the proposed rules would concentrate new housing downtown while preserving single - family homes elsewhere .
The smallest units , Perry said , might be attractive to young professionals who want to buy a condo but ca n’t afford anything larger , or to service workers who could n’t otherwise afford to buy or rent near their downtown jobs .
Burbank architect Mark Gangi , who also teaches at USC , said the rules could help mold downtown into a lively metropolitan center .

The new apartments might be used by those who need an affordable place to live , he said , but they might also become pieds - a - terre for professionals and others who want a modest place where they can stay overnight if they are working or seeing a show or ballgame .
But others are more skeptical about how tiny units would fare in Los Angeles .
Raphael Bostic , associate director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at USC , said developers might take advantage of the city ’s offer to let them build affordable units without parking spaces , because the cost of such parking can be prohibitive .
“ Only the most adventurous would do the very small units , ” he said .
Jeff Lee , a developer active in the downtown area , said he was doubtful there ’d be a market for 250 - square - foot apartments or condos .
“ That would n’t be much more than a bathroom and 10 - by - 10 bedroom , ” said Lee , who built the Market Lofts downtown .
Advertisement
Jane Blumenfeld , L.A. 's principal city planner , said that in cities like New York and San Francisco , people live happily in tiny apartments and condos .
But Joel Kotkin , an urban affairs expert , questioned whether such units would help the city ’s goal of creating a feeling of community downtown .
“ You ’re creating tiny spaces that people live in for short periods of time , ” Kotkin said .
L.A. 's downtown is still not desirable enough to entice well - heeled purchasers to buy or rent a studio when they can live in a larger place elsewhere , Kotkin said .

“ They say that in New York and San Francisco people live [ in small apartments ] a long time .
Well , downtown L.A. , you ’re not New York and you ’re not San Francisco . ”

A reducibly complex mousetrap
John H. McDonald
Department of Biological Sciences
University of Delaware
Creationist Michael
Behe attracted a lot of attention with his advocacy of the " intelligent design " argument .
He makes the claim that certain biochemical processes are " irreducibly complex " : they involve multiple proteins , and removing any one of them would destroy the function of the overall pathway .
From this he concludes that these pathways could not have evolved through the action of natural selection , but instead must have been created by an " intelligent designer . "
To illustrate the concept of irreducibly complexity , Behe uses the common snap mousetrap .
" If any one of the components of the mousetrap ( the base , hammer , spring , catch , or holding bar ) is removed , then the trap does not function .
In other words , the simple little mousetrap has no ability to trap a mouse until several separate parts are all assembled .
Because the mousetrap is necessarily composed of several parts , it is irreducibly complex . "
( Behe , 1996 ) .
It is not my purpose here to point out all of the philosophical flaws in Behe 's argument ; this has been done thoroughly elsewhere ( see Talk Origins and Talk Design to get started into the literature ) .
Instead , I wish to point out that the mousetrap that Behe uses as an analogy CAN be reduced in complexity and still function as a mousetrap .
The mousetrap illustrates one of the fundamental flaws in the intelligent design argument : the fact that one person can't imagine something does n't mean it is impossible , it may just mean that the person has a limited imagination .
Behe 's evidence that biochemical pathways are intelligently designed is that Behe can't imagine how they could function without all of their parts , but given how easy it is to reduce the complexity of a mousetrap , I 'm not convinced .
( Of course , the reduced - complexity mousetraps shown below are intended to point out one of the logical flaws in the intelligent design argument ; they 're not intended as an analogy of how evolution works . )
My original reduced - complexity mousetraps must have struck a nerve , since Behe later added a web page lengthy " rebuttal " of them to his webpage .
I find his objections muddled and confusing , but he seems to be saying that showing how something would work after removing some parts is not enough to reject irreducible complexity ; it is necessary to show how something could be built up , step by step , with each addition or modification of a part improving the function .
This seems to go beyond the original definition ( " necessarily composed of several parts " ) , but I have merely taken it as a challenge .
Here I show how one could start with a single piece of spring wire , make an inefficient mousetrap , then through a series of modifications and additions of parts make better and better mousetraps , until the end result is the modern snap mousetrap .
In addition to demonstrating that a mousetrap is not irreducibly complex , I also illustrate the most important objection to " irreducible complexity " as evidence for " intelligent design " : a part which may be optional at one stage of complexity may later become necessary due to modifications of some of the other parts .
A completely different series of mousetraps in various stages of complexity has been designed by Alex Fidelibus .
A recent article by Joachim Dagg ( Dagg , J. 2011 .
Exploring mouse trap history .
Evolution : Education and Outreach ) reviews the history of actual mousetraps , showing that they did indeed " evolve " from simple to more complex through time , including mousetraps that were similar to the modern snap mousetrap but had fewer parts .
( This page has been translated into Romanian by Jan Rolsky , developer of a free mp4 converter ) .
( If the " Animate " buttons do n't make the pictures move , make sure your browser has Javascript enabled . )
I 'll start with a piece of springy wire , bent so that it can be held open by carefully positioning one end of the wire against the other .
If an unlucky mouse steps on the trap and dislodges the ends , the trap closes .
Most mice knock the trap over rather than sticking their necks through it , and the spring is so weak that some mice wriggle out before they die , so it 's not a very good trap .
Still , it 's better than having no trap at all .
Adding a coil to the previous trap makes the trap close with more force .
Every coil that is added makes the trap close with greater force , increasing the proportion of mice that get killed .
Adding bait makes the trap more efficient by attracting more mice to it .
Bait is an optional part of all of the traps shown here ; all of these traps would catch mice that happened to stumble into them .
The previous traps need to be carefully propped against a wall or other object , which limits the places they can be used and lets mice knock the trap over .
Attaching the spring to the floor with one or two staples increases the usefulness of the trap , because it can now be used anywhere the floor is wooden , and mice wo n't knock it over .
The staples are optional at this point .
Attaching the spring to a piece of wood is even better , since it 's easier to move around , does n't leave holes in the floor , and can be used on concrete floors .
The wooden platform and the staples are optional , though ; the trap would still work with just the spring .
Making the swinging end of the wire ( the " hammer " ) longer increases the chance that it will hit a mouse , so as it gradually goes from I - shaped to L - shaped to U - shaped , it gradually becomes more effective .
The free end of a U - shaped hammer might flex enough that it would n't crush all mice ; tucking it into the coils of the spring improves on this .
The previous trap had the hammer propped up on a vertical piece of wire .
This must be done very precisely , so that a mouse brushing against the vertical piece of wire will dislodge the hammer .
Adding another piece of wire as a hold - down bar makes it easier to set the trap and easier for a mouse to trip it .
One end of the hold - down bar is jammed into the end of the wooden platform , while the other end is hooked under the corner of the hammer .
When a mouse nudges the hold - down bar , dislodging it from the corner of the hammer , it releases the hammer .
Because the hold - down bar is a lever , it holds the hammer down with much less force and therefore requires less force to dislodge .
The base of the previous trap will eventually get splintered where the hold - down bar is jammed into it .
Using a staple to hold the end of the hold - down bar increases the useful life of the mousetrap .
With the hold - down bar in use , the vertical part of the spring wire is unnecessary and maybe even in the way .
Shortening it saves wire , making the trap less costly .
This modification has some dramatic side effects , though .
Now the hold - down bar and the staples are necessary parts of the trap , rather than just optional improvements .
Take away the hold - down bar or the staples , and this version of the trap would not catch any mice .
This is an analogy for the way that an initially optional protein in a biochemical pathway later could become necessary to the function of the pathway , due to adaptative modification of other enzymes .
The previous traps have a lot of upward force on the leftmost staple , which might eventually work its way out .
Eliminating that staple saves a little on the cost of the trap and may increase its useful life .
On the previous traps , the only mice that get caught are those that push the hold down bar outward ; mice that push it in towards the spring fail to dislodge it .
Resting the end of the hold - down bar under the top of a bent - over staple is better ; now a mouse that pushes the bar in either direction will trigger the trap .
Spring wire is harder to work with than regular wire , and I 'll bet it 's more expensive , too .
Using regular wire for the rectangular hammer and using spring wire only for the spring makes the trap a little cheaper and easier to build .
This is an analogy for another way that a seemingly " irreducible " pathway could originate : a single protein that performs two functions could evolve into two proteins , each of which performs a single , necessary function .
The hold - down bar in the previous traps still required a fair - sized nudge to dislodge it from the bent - over staple .
Hooking a clever little catch onto the staple makes it much easier to trigger the trap ; any jiggle of the catch releases the hold - down bar , releasing the hammer , and killing the mouse .

A note from the editors :
This historically important article , while now outdated , predicted the age of web fonts .
CSS is ten years old this year .
Such an anniversary is an
opportunity to revisit the past and chart the future .
CSS
has fundamentally changed web design by separating style from structure .
It has provided designers with a set of properties that can be tweaked to make marked - up pages look right — and CSS3 proposes additional properties requested by designers .
Article Continues Below
Many CSS properties , both old and new , deal with text : they describe text
color , position , style , and direction .
This is all very
good — after all , text fills most of our screens .
But in order for
properties to reach their full potential , we need a good
selection of fonts .
And fonts are sorely missing from the web .
Consider the fine designs in the CSS Zen Garden .
What makes them so
exciting to look at ?
In part , it is the variety of fonts .
Fonts convey design messages and create effect , and while in
traditional print design there are a plethora of fonts available , fonts have been in limited supply on the web .
Web designers
depend on ten or so universally available fonts for their designs , and are reduced in large part to using Verdana and Arial over and over again .
A typical CSS Zen Garden design , on the other hand , uses a hand - picked
font to render text and aligns the glyphs to a pixel - perfect degree …and then uses that text as a background image .
A background image !
There are many reasons why background images should not be used to convey text .
Images are expensive to transmit and hard to make .
Imagine trying to translate a web page into 15 languages and having to produce a set of images for each language .
Additionally , the quality of printed web pages suffers as images do n’t scale to the resolutions offered by modern printers .
Using background images is currently the only way designers can use their favorite fonts on the web .
But should n’t web designers have access to a wider selection of fonts and be able to use them without having to resort to creating background images ?
There is a way : web fonts .
Instead of making pictures of fonts , the actual font files can be linked to and retrieved from the web .
This way , designers can use TrueType fonts without having to freeze the text as background images .
A brief history of web fonts #section2
This is not a new idea .
In 1998 , CSS2 described a way to link to fonts from style sheets , and both Microsoft and Netscape added support for web fonts in their browsers .
However , neither vendor supported the most widely used font format , TrueType .
Instead , they each picked a different , little - used format with few tools to support it ( EOT and TrueDoc , respectively ) .
And so web fonts disappeared from the designer ’s toolbox .
Better news#section3
It ’s a pleasure for me to announce that web fonts are back !
Here
are some recently generated examples that show how a familiar document
can be rendered when TrueType web fonts are available :

The PDF ( and image ) examples shown in this article have been produced by Prince 6 , a
web - to - PDF - through - CSS renderer .
( The Macintosh version must be installed via Terminal .
Instructions are included in a ReadMe file .
— Ed. )
Prince is currently the only program
that supports TrueType web fonts , but it provides the proof of concept we need to begin thinking seriously about web fonts — and to begin advocating for their implementation in common web browsers .
Before we get to that , though , let ’s take a look at the code beneath these examples .
( Disclosure : I ’m on the board
of YesLogic , the company behind Prince .
Being on the board is a neat way of pushing for your favorite
features to be implemented . )
The examples are coded in HTML and CSS only ; no images are
involved .
CSS3 multi-column layouts and rounded borders have been
added for good measure , but they are not essential to the designs .
Each example uses four different web fonts .
The style sheets point to
web font files which are fetched before the documents are rendered .
Web fonts : the code you ’ll use#section4
Here is a simple example of how to use web fonts ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
@font - face { font - family : " Kimberley " ; src : url ( http://www.princexml.com/fonts/larabie/ » kimberle.ttf ) format ( " truetype " ) ; } h1 { font - family : " Kimberley " , sans - serif }
Those familiar with CSS syntax will recognize the last line .
The @font - face construct may not be familiar , however it ’s easy to
explain : as the “ Kimberley ” font is requested , the font file
is fetched from the specified URL .
The syntax is described in the
CSS2 specification .
To avoid long lists of @font - face declarations in the style sheet ,
they can be hidden using @import ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
@import url( http://www.princexml.com/fonts/ » larabie/index.css ) all ; h1 { font - family : Goodfish , serif }
The TrueType files used in the examples above are designed by Ray Larabie .
He is a renowned
font designer who has made hundreds of interesting TrueType fonts
freely available for use on the web .
His fonts are elegant ,
decorative , and playful .
Dieter
Steffmann is another great font designer .
He , too , has made many beautiful fonts available for anyone
to use .
Below are some examples that use his fonts :

Getting more complicated #section5
When browsers start supporting web fonts , designers will be tempted
to adjust more properties than just font - family .
In the examples shown
above , line - height , letter - spacing , word - spacing , and absolute
positioning have been tweaked .
This adjustment of other properties works well when the specified
fonts are fetched from the web .
However , it may have unexpected
results in browsers that do n’t support web fonts , and web designers should always
be make sure their pages degrade gracefully .
The most obvious way to ensure graceful degradation is to
specify a list of similar font families .
For example , Ray Larabie ’s “ Primer Apples ” is a charming , stitched font .
You can see it
used in this example :
Screenshot of web page using real TrueType fonts .
PDF ( via Prince ) .
HTML ( via your browser ) .
“ Primer Apples ” has no obvious replacement in the list
of fonts normally used on the web .
However , the font metrics are quite
similar to the ubiquitous “ Trebuchet ” font which can be specified as an
alternative ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
font - family : " Primer Apples " , " Trebuchet MS " , » sans - serif ;
In a legacy browser without support for web fonts ( or multi-column
layouts or rounded borders ) , the second example will look like this :
Screenshot of web page without support for web fonts .
The stitching is gone , but the degradation is graceful .
A proposal to the W3C : a media query for web fonts #section6
To further limit degradation , it would be useful to have a media query for web
fonts .
Consider this example :
h1 { font - family : " Trebuchet MS " , sans - serif ; letter - spacing : 0.1em ; }@media all and ( web- fonts : " truetype " ) { h1 { font - family : " Primer Apples " , sans - serif ; letter - spacing : 0.2em ; } }
As a result of the media query in the example above , the actual
letter - spacing will depend on whether web fonts are supported or not .
It is also necessary to specify , in the media query , that support for
TrueType is required .
The “ web- fonts ” media query is not in the W3C’s
current Media
Queries specification and it has not been implemented by anyone .
But it ’s a great idea , and very doable .
What does this mean in the real world ?
# section7
While Prince offers a neat proof - of - concept , common web browsers must
also add support for web fonts in order for them to become the next
big thing .
So why have n’t they done so already ?
The arguments against web fonts are mostly legal .
Fonts are
intellectual property and therefore , the argument goes , cannot be
published on the web .
Although the legal status of font shapes is
uncertain , font names are probably covered by copyright law .
As such ,
fonts are similar to copyrighted images and text .
To publish
copyrighted material on the web , you need permission from the
copyright holder .
There is a lot of text and images on the web because
copyright holders allow it , even encourage it .
Likewise , many font
designers ( including Ray
Larabie and Dieter Steffmann , whose fonts I use as examples in this article ) allow
their fonts to be freely used on the web .
The best argument against web fonts , however , is n’t legalities — it ’s aesthetics .
Do we want to wade through web pages displayed in
third - rate fonts put together by designers who once used the
< blink > tag and created backgrounds with animated GIFs ?
Probably not .
Once web fonts are available , make sure you use a browser in which author style sheets can be turned off .
( Another disclosure : That would be Shift + G in Opera . )
Aesthetics also provide a strong argument for web fonts .
There
are many beautiful and interesting fonts that can improve aesthetics
and increase visual variety on the web .
Just as I am sometimes stunned
by beautiful book designs , I want to be overwhelmed by beautiful web
pages .
And , I do n’t want those beautiful pages to be made up of
background images .
You can help !#section8
Two things must happen before web fonts can take web design to the
next level .
First , we must ensure the validity of the approach .
Is the
subset of CSS2 that has been implemented sufficient ?
Do we like the
CSS code ?
The best way to help is to play with the
existing implementation and report back on your experience .
Second , we must convince browser makers to add support for web
fonts .
This can be difficult .
Browser vendors have lots of
specifications and well - intended improvement proposals to choose from .
Some of them are also busy fixing bugs .
In order for new functionality
to make it onto the roadmaps , a compelling story must be told , and a
critical mass of developers must voice their support .
We can make it happen .

What Would Happen To Fanboys Remaking Raiders Of The Lost Ark Today ?

Illegal taping :
The friends were able to learn the entire movie by sneaking a videocamera into the theater and taping it .
As you know , the industry has been passing stricter and stricter laws for anyone found video taping a movie .
The latest law in NY would lead to a $ 5,000 fine ( the boys made their entire movie for $ 4,500 ) and 6 months in jail .

Copyright infringement :
By copying the entire film , clearly they could be accused of copyright infringement .
In fact , just last year , Paramount sued an amateur filmmaker who downloaded the script for an Oliver Stone movie and tried to film his own version using acting students .
Ironically ( or maybe it's just sad ) , it 's Paramount that 's making the film about these boys recreating Raiders .

Music rights :
The film apparently makes use of the original score , which is obviously a no - no for the recording industry , as witnessed by the fact that the famed sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati had to dub in generic music as it could n't afford the rights to use the music it had licensed for the original show .

Public performance : Despite being infringing , this film has n't just been for private use .
It was first shown in a Coca - Cola factory auditorium upon completion , as well as at a variety of underground film festivals since then .

Wired is running a fascinating story about a set of three 12 - year - old friends , who became so obsessed with the moviein 1981 , that they spent the next seven summers refilming the movie shot for shot .
It 's a great story ( in fact , so great , that there 's actually a real movie being madethese three friends making this movie ) , but you have to wonder what would happen if the same thing were tried again today .
You 'd have to think that the three kids would end up in an awful lot of trouble , rather than being celebrated .
Let 's run through the list ...
Everyone seems to acknowledge that this film probably violates all sorts of intellectual property rules -- though both Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas appear to be fine with it .
However , a set of kids trying to do the same thing today would actually find it more difficult .
While the tools to do so have become much more powerful and much cheaper -- the legal regime has become much worse .
And , frankly , does n't it seem like something is wrong with the system when a bunch of kids can't do something like this ?
It was n't just a tremendously fun project for the trio , but apparently a great learning experience .
All three of the " kids " now work in the entertainment industry .
On top of that , the film has a huge cult following and has made many people extremely happy .
You'd be hard pressed to come up with a way that this " cost " the original creators of the content a dime ( and , if anything , probably encouraged a few more people to watch or rewatch the original ) .
So why is it that these same kids today would potentially face time in jail , both criminal and civil lawsuits and huge fines for doing the same thing ?
Any backtracking from Mr. Craig is not likely to go over well with Republican leaders .
Within hours of the incident ’s becoming public , the Senate leadership initiated an ethics inquiry , stripped him of his committee leadership positions and let Mr. Craig know he could face public hearings into his conduct if he chose to try to survive the furor .
A top Senate Republican aide , after hearing about Mr. Craig ’s possible return Tuesday night , suggested that Mr. Craig was desperate .
“ The people of Idaho and the rest of America were led to believe Senator Craig would resign , ” said the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ To go back on that intent means that he will only be a negative distraction for his colleagues .
Like a fish out of water , he is gasping for his last breath of political air . ”
Late Tuesday , Roll Call , the newspaper that covers Congress and first broke the story of Mr. Craig ’s guilty plea , posted on its
Web site an audiotape of a voice message the senator apparently intended for a lawyer of his , Billy Martin , on Saturday morning as he was heading to the news conference in which he announced his intention to resign .
In the message , Mr. Craig indicated he could reconsider resigning .
“ Arlen Specter is now willing to come out in my defense , arguing that it appears by all that he knows that I ’ve been railroaded , all of that , ” the senator said .
“ Having all of that , we ’ve reshaped my statement a little bit to say it is my intent to resign on Sept. 30 . ”
Jon Hanian , a spokesman for Gov. C. L. Otter of Idaho , said Tuesday night that the governor learned that Mr. Craig was wavering on his resignation after a inquiry by a reporter about the possibility earlier in the day .
Mr. Hanian also said the possibility that the senator would reconsider his resignation “ has been buzzing around the delegation . ”

According to the US State Department , anyone who believes that " vast , powerful , evil forces are secretly manipulating events , " is a conspiracy theorist . [ 1 ]
Belief that our government answers to a secret higher authority is an " extremist belief system , " according to the authors of the " Prevention of Homegrown Terrorism Act – H.R. 1955 . " [ 2 ]
Spreading these beliefs to " advance political , religious , or social change " is defined as " radicalization . "
If you believe that the creators and dispensers of fiat money and their corporations control our democratic Republic and manipulate events to outcomes favorable to their control , then you are an extremist .
If you are trying to educate your fellow countrymen , to democratically change this equation , then you may find yourself accused of " facilitating ideologically - based violence . "
If you seek to break the back of the debt - based financial system , you will find yourself up against seemingly insurmountable odds , trying to awaken a demoralized society , that has been broken over many generations by the psychological warfare tactic of " learned helplessness . " [ 3 ]
Total economic control over people provides the controllers of the essential borrowed money with the means to indoctrinate with the psychology of hopelessness .
Fear of further economic losses is a powerful motivating tool .
After nearly one - hundred years of this domination and control , Americans have been robbed of hope .
Today 's sleepwalking zombie population of " sheeple " is a product of the world 's longest running psychological warfare operation .
The brainwashing by the secret rulers of America extends into every conceivable area of possible indoctrination or control .
Learned hopelessness is taught through every communications medium .
In a world of mass - hypnosis and mass - seduction , entertainment has proven to be the most effective psychological weapon .
Television serves that purpose twenty - four hours a day , by providing both negative reinforcement of the idea of the fragility of the human condition ( through the " news " ) , coupled with positive subliminal suggestions of hope in the idea of intervening heroes .
Organized religion is probably the most entertaining and the most debilitating form of mass entertainment , because along with the show comes a false sense of hope , that can only be obtained by surrendering the free will to a " higher power . "
This is the comforting element of the conflicting teachings ( knowing that you will be saved by some superior force ) , providing a counterbalance to the rest of the teachings of personal inferiority , unworthiness and helplessness , which are designed to make you know that you are incapable of saving yourself .
" Christianity " was the official Roman state religion created by order of Caesar .
It was an amalgam of all the popular " pagan " religions within the empire . [ 4 ]
It was designed by " priests , " to make the subject peoples easier to control .
The beauty of this religion 's craftsmanship is that people seduced by this manmade religion , want to be misled .
They are enslaved by its teachings of their own inferiority and " unworthiness , " in relation to the only worthy " One " ( who will save their wretched hides ) .
The dual message of helplessness and hope makes believers susceptible to this form of spiritual / psychological dictatorship , masquerading as the One True Religion .
The best that the faithful can hope for is to accept the teachings about their innate helplessness , to get access to the accompanying " out " clause .
By signing on to the contract , they give up their free will to a more evolved superior , in exchange for promises of eternal rewards .
For Catholics , the pope is the most superior human being ; they believe in his claims of infallibility .
For American Protestants , faith in the magical one , who " will come with the clouds , " is a more intangible belief and a more illogical one .
This belief , that blind faith in an invisible superior brings fantastic magical rewards , makes Protestants even easier to manipulate .
A populace that is conditioned to look for salvation to come down from the sky ( whether it comes in the form of a god or an alien ) , will believe in anything that is done in their hero 's name .
A nation of demoralized lost sheeple is easy to lead further astray by the introduction of false heroes through the twenty - four hour indoctrination box .
Television brings the time - tested formula of learned helplessness and false hope into the lives of everyone , even the non-religious .
It is here where the perfected art of mass brainwashing reaches the peak of perfection .
Escapist entertainment conveys the suggestive brain - numbing message of hope from hopelessness to the hollowed - out minds of the American people .
Here our elitist masters entertain us with pretend heroes , while we " suspend disbelief " and become desensitized to the violence that is necessary to extend the empire beyond America 's shores .
Using imaginary heroes , like Jack Bauer of " 24 , " illegal acts ( ranging from illegal wiretapping , to torture and even cold - blooded murder ) are made acceptable and justified as necessary for " national security . " [ 5 ]
To reach even bigger audiences , a larger indoctrination screen is required .
The big screen brings us heroic figures of messianic proportions .
Comic book super - heroes come to life and save everybody from certain utter doom .
Even more heroic than these " super " types are the heart - wrenching exploits of seemingly ordinary people , who rise above their own hopeless circumstances , to lead other ordinary citizens in mass uprisings against tyranny .
These are the most loaded of all the contrived plots , intended to mislead the real heroic types among the disillusioned masses to believe that violence against corrupted authority is humanity 's only hope .
This is where movies like the " Matrix " series and " V is for Vendetta " become integral parts of the conspiracy to eliminate the last barrier to total permanent dictatorship .
In both of these heroic films , we find elements of the actual conspiracy on display for all to see , leading to a climactic finish where horrendous acts of violence are justified in the end .
" Neo " rages against the system of enforced hopelessness , where society is docilely anesthetized by an unreal " Matrix " of an illusory world , and humans are reduced to a mere commodity ( " copper top " batteries ) , to power the corrupt system .
" Zionism " is equated with the superior humans , who are bold enough to take up arms and have faith to the bitter end , in the process humanizing the inhumane ideology of God 's " chosen people . "
In the movie " V is for Vendetta " ( by the same Jewish film - makers , the Wachowski brothers ) , " V " uses multiple acts of horrific terrorism , in a decimated post - Bush apocalyptic world ( including blowing - up the British Parliament ) , to spark the non-violent revolution that allegedly will free mankind .
This theme , that violent acts of terrorism are justifiable in defense of freedom , is the final piece of the conspiracy puzzle .
We have been bombarded with this message through the hypnotic mediums for many years , for a reason .
Our corporate masters want us to provide the spark of antiwar violence that will justify the final crackdown on American democracy .
Everything that has been done by the current administration to finish building the framework for an American police state has been done in preparation for the anticipated spark of violent resistance .
The American antiwar movement is deeply concerned about the conspiracy 's henchmen the Bush Administration and their next move , intended to complete the transition from democracy to dictatorship .
Many of us are most worried about another " false flag " terror attack initiating the end of freedom , even though the end is more likely to come in response to homegrown terrorism from the disillusioned masses .
Everyday on the Internet we see proof of this growing tendency to answer violent repression with acts of counter - violence , committed in the name of " pacifism . "
Accompanying the many excellent articles and blogs seeking to advance political , religious , or social change by educating the American people about our Constitutional power to change our government , we read commentary that promotes violent revolution .
Whether these comments are made by provocateurs or those lost souls who are simply misled is irrelevant .
What is important is that these ridiculous comments do not go unanswered .
If we want to deter those who urge violence in this manner , we have to refute every comment urging violence and destruction .
We cannot provide the secret government with the justification that they seek .
Effective opposition to the coming police state requires that we become self - policing in our efforts to " radicalize " by spreading the truth .
To become the acceptable source of credible news we must dedicate ourselves to finding the hidden truth , wherever that search takes us .
If we find the hidden truth about government complicity in the many cover-ups , then we must boldly proclaim it to the world as clearly as possible , in truths that are simple to understand .
If that simple truth is that our government promotes a bi-partisan campaign of terrorism and planned genocide in the name of freedom , then we must clearly say just that – no matter the personal cost of that ugly expression of truth .

Dead fish washed up from a hypoxic zone near the German coast
Scientists say conditions are right for the zone to exceed last summer 's 6,662 sq miles ( 17,255 sq km ) .
The dead zone is an area of water virtually devoid of oxygen which cannot support marine life .
It is caused by nutrients such as fertilisers flowing into the Gulf , stimulating the growth of algae which absorbs the available oxygen .
The volume of nutrients flowing down rivers such as the Mississippi into the Gulf has tripled over the last 50 years .
The annual event has been blamed for shark attacks along the Gulf coast , as sharks , along with other highly mobile species , flee the inhospitable waters .
Animals which cannot move simply die .
Nutrient load
The relatively high nitrate loading may be due to more intensive farming of more land , including crops used for biofuels
Eugene Turner
" The relatively high nitrate loading may be due to more intensive farming of more land , including crops used for biofuels , unique weather patterns , or changing farming practices . "
The nitrate load is so high that the dead zone may attain a size of 8,500 sq miles ( 22,015 sq km ) , almost double the average since 1990 .
However , an active storm season could change that forecast , as storms mix the seas , dispersing nutrients and algae and bringing in oxygenated water .
Algae also cause severe pollution in lakes such as Dianchi in China
The United Nations warns that dead zones are becoming more common globally as intensive agriculture spreads .
Its 2003 Global Environment Outlook said that the number of seasonal hypoxic areas has doubled each decade since the 1960s .
The UN believes the algal blooms are having a significant impact on commercially valuable fish stocks .

Bill Brown , of the Surveillance Camera Players , and author of We Know You Are Watching : Surveillance Camera Players 1996 - 2006 discusses the rise of the American surveillance state .
MP3 here .
( 35:09 )
Bill Brown co-founded the Surveillance Camera Players in 1996 and is the brain behind NotBored.org .
OBL's " Bleed Until Bankruptcy Plan " - which he declared in the 1 November 2004 pre-election tape - has worked admirably at leading the USA toward economic self - destruction .
On the 19 January 2006 tape OBL offered the American people - who he recognised as turning against Bush - a truce in exchange for US withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan .
OBL suggested that reasonable Americans should see that , " It is better not to fight the Muslims on their land and for them not to fight us [ Americans ] on our land . "
When OBL then threatened further attacks by saying , " The operations are under preparation and you will see them in your homes , " many interpreted this as meaning more terrorist attacks on American cities .
In fact , it may have been a hint of the new front in the war is the American dependence on Middle Eastern oil .
This became clearer with the release of a 63 page Saudi Al Qaida policy last week .
The attacks in our homes will be on our energy reliance - the essential American comfort of heat , air conditioning , cheap electricity , and cheap gasoline .
From 2001 to 2005 OBL's " Bleed Until Bankruptcy Plan " involved quite small Al Qaida terrorist operations aimed at American targets .
These incurred minor financial outlay , but required suicide terrorists and a expert preparations .
Examples include the attacks on USA military and diplomatic posts in Africa , the 9 - 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon , and the guerilla attacks which ensure wasteful and pointless occupations and deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq .
OBL exploited the American tendency to over - reaction as a means of straining the finances and military strength of the USA .
Again from the November 2004 speech :
al - Qaida spent $ 500,000 on the event , while America , in the incident and its aftermath , lost - according to the lowest estimate - more than $ 500 billion .
Meaning that every dollar of al - Qaida defeated a million dollars by the permission of Allah , besides the loss of a huge number of jobs .
As for the size of the economic deficit , it has reached record astronomical numbers estimated to total more than a trillion dollars .
Now that the majority of Americans recognise the folly of being led to war by Bush , the mammoth challenge of debt weighing on the economy , and dangers of further turmoil in the Middle East , OBL is changing tactics - and it 's brilliant .
OBL is escalating , but in a way that is more likely to alienate Americans from Bush than cause blowback in the Middle East .
OBL is taking Bush 's " We 'll fight 'em over there so we do n't have to fight 'em over here " and turning it on its head .
Al Qaida will now target oil installations in the Middle East as the most effective means of bankrupting and destabilising Americans at home .
The shift in Irish Republican Army tactics in the 1990s toward economic targets - the City of London , the Canary Wharf financial centre , and shopping malls - marked a very successful change of campaign strategy .
Very few lives were lost , but the economic pain and business disruption was enormous .
While governments of all stripes seem capable of ignoring loss of life - although loudly decrying it - they tend to pay attention more closely when business interests start to hurt .
Whether the IRA 's economic targets led to the willingness of the British government to first negotiate and later compromise and finally share power with Irish Republicans may be debatable , but the results are not .
The Al Anzy statement released last week after the Alqaiq refinery attack bodes ill for the future prosperity of Americans :
" Oil is the basis of modern industry and the backbone of industries in infidel countries .
With it , America was able to impose its dominance on the world , " al - Anzy purportedly wrote in the 63 - page document , titled " The Ruling on Targeting Oil Interests . "
" God 's wisdom has decreed that the oil wealth be concentrated in the Arabian peninsula and Iraq .
This , in addition to some religious reasons , is the reason for the American occupation of Saudi Arabia decades ago and its latest occupation of Iraq . "
He continued : " Pipelines may be the front line in a long - term war of attrition on oil and its interests .
There is a great benefit in targeting oil pipelines to spite enemies in a way not realized by other means .
Pipelines are an easy target militarily .
Their protection is virtually impossible because of their length . "
Oil facilities and tankers also are fair targets , the document said .
" Targeting refineries and oil factories is not very different from targeting oil pipelines " as long as they are owned by the state or " a nonbeliever , " he purportedly wrote .
However , oil wells should not be attacked as long as there are other industry targets .
" The harm caused by targeting oil wells in the lands of Muslims outweigh the benefits because of health and environmental damages and because this will deprive Muslims of the benefit ( of the oil wells ) when God allows victory , " the document said .
The Bleed Until Bankruptcy Plan was working well enough .
Any haemorrhage of oil from the pipelines , refineries and tankers OVER THERE will speed defeat of Americans HERE .
An excellent analysis by Gal Luft in the Washington Post this morning reinforces the importance of the shift in Al Qaida strategy :
[ If the car bombers had succeeded at Abqaiq . ]
The attack would have removed 4 million to 6 million barrels a day of supply from an already tight oil market .
That loss would have exceeded all of the oil taken off the market by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries during the 1973 Arab oil embargo .
Depending on the extent of damage to the site , it could have taken months or even years to fix the facility , where two - thirds of Saudi crude oil is processed .
Without extra supplies , the only mechanism left to restore the market to equilibrium would be a rapid and uncontrolled increase in prices .
This vulnerability is n't lost on radical Islamic terrorists .
They have identified the world energy system as the Achilles ' heel of the West and have made attacking it a central part of their plan .
It is difficult to see how America can effectively respond .
Luft recommends increasing strategic reserves , but it is hard to see how this could be done with so little spare production and refinery capacity worldwide .
Whatever steps we take to secure supplies , the truth is that a single ground - launched missile taking out a tanker in the Straights of Hormuz or a single successful suicide attack on a major Saudi refinery would send the US economy into a tailspin of catastrophic proportions .
Without cheap oil from the Middle East , the US economy is about as efficient and productive as East Germany at the time of reunification .
I do n't have any answers , but I sure wish the risk were getting more rational analysis .
And I wish we had some strategists in the Pentagon that could match OBL for results .

1860 : The first Pony Express rider reaches Sacramento , California .
“ Wanted .
Young , skinny , wiry fellows .
Not over 18 .
Must be expert riders .
Willing to risk death daily .
Orphans preferred . ”
The ad , which appeared in a California newspaper , was n’t quite accurate .
Of the 183 men known to have ridden for the Pony Express , few were under 18 ( although the youngest , Broncho Charlie , was 11 ) and few were orphans .
But the message was clear ; it was a tough way to earn a living , even at the princely wage of $ 100 a month .
The Pony Express operated between St. Joseph , Missouri , and Sacramento .
Riders did not make the entire trip but worked in a relay system .
The route per rider averaged between 75 and 100 miles and riders changed horses approximately every 10 to 15 miles .
During summer , it took about 10 days to cover the entire route .
Winter lengthened the travel time to around two weeks .
The advent of the telegraph put a quick end to the Pony Express .
Despite its lofty place in American western folklore , the operation lasted barely 18 months , from April 1860 to October 1861 .

Amec , the British infrastructure project manager , is warning that much of the reconstruction work it has done in Iraq in the past 18 months could be wiped out if funding for programmes is scaled back .
The prediction comes a week after reports indicated that the White House would not seek additional funds for rebuilding the country once the $ 18.4bn agreed by Congress in autumn 2003 has been spent .
In mid-term election year , the Bush administration is working on its 2007 budget and is seeking to cut spending against the background of a growing deficit and the costs of hurricane relief and the Iraq conflict .
Reconstruction in the country appears to be a casualty .
Bush has boasted of leaving Iraqi infrastructure in a better state than it was under Saddam .
In March 2004 he talked of rebuilding the country so that ' a free Iraq can quickly gain economic independence ' .
He pointed to its oil wealth , saying it was producing 2 million barrels a day and to pledges of international aid .
But while a White House spokesman tellingly talked of US funding in the past tense - the officer overseeing reconstruction for the US Army Corps of Engineers said the US had never intended to rebuild Iraq completely .
The $ 18bn was a springboard , he said .
Now , Amec , the biggest non-US operator in Iraq , warns that there is great uncertainty for the future .
Amec , through a joint venture with US engineer Fluor , won several major contracts in Iraq from the Coalition Provisional Authority , the interim body that subsequently handed over to the Iraqi government .
In March 2004 the joint venture won a $ 500 m deal to rebuild electricity infrastructure and secured a $ 1.1 bn contract to restore its water system .
Amec 's share of these deals was $ 240 m and $ 540 m respectively .
It also has a smaller contract for environmental work .
Amec says the work under the main three contracts is largely completed .
It expects to finish what it was asked to do by the end of March .
However , Amec says the work it has done may not last long .
A spokesman said : ' Recently , as much as 25 per cent of work completed has been repairing infrastructure damaged by insurgents .
If funding levels are not maintained , insurgent activity could quickly [ undo ] much of our work over the past 18 months . '
He added : ' Regarding future work , we would say that with uncertainty in the region and the withdrawal of US funding , it is difficult to predict levels of activity . '
The insurgency has bedevilled the reconstruction effort and added massively to costs .
Funds originally earmarked for rebuilding have been diverted to pay for exigencies such as training a security force .
Amec , which has several hundred project managers in the country , managing up to 10,000 contractors , has regularly had to stop projects because of insurgent activity .
For smaller operators , the environment has often proved too much .
Graham Hand of the British Consultants and Contractors Bureau says that of about 30 British contractors in Iraq two years ago , there are now only half a dozen there .
' When companies first went out , they were told by the government that it was difficult , but would get better .
It has got worse . '
Companies have to pay for the protection teams provided by outfits such as Control Risks , which employ ex-servicemen in armoured 4x4 vehicles to escort civilian personnel around the country at a typical cost of $ 5,000 to $ 8,000 a day .
Andy Bearpark , former head of operations at the Coalition Provisional Authority and now a UK - based consultant , says : ' The experience of reconstruction has been expensive , difficult and slow .
People have not seen the improvements they thought they were going to see .
The result is you get an Iraqi population that is disaffected . '
Despite Amec 's claim that it has nearly finished what it was asked to do , Iraq 's infrastructure appears to be in a worse condition that it was before the war .
For example , the electricity supply is still around 4,000 megawatts , about the pre-war level .
On average , there is 12 hours of supply a day .
Meanwhile , oil production is 1.1 million barrels a day , below pre-war levels .
Lack of electricity causes civil unrest - there have been riots .
And , as the US made clear , oil production is vital if Iraq is to stand by itself .
Bearpark says America has invested more than any other country , but it has not seen the results .
' It is a tough position , ' he said .
There is some light , however .
Neil Quillian , an Iraq analyst with Control Risks , says : ' Some contractors are saying they are optimistic following December 's elections . '
He says the fact that disaffected Sunni muslims participated in the vote suggests a more peaceful future .
Does he believe this ?
He is unsure .
Does Bearpark ?
No. And Amec ?
The company will only repeat that the future remains uncertain .

What appears to be going on regarding Iran is a struggle within the administration over how to approach the Shi’ite mullah - dominated country that looms so large not only in the American imagination but as a regional power that is bound to have considerable influence in the region , especially with Iraq ( assuming there is an entity that can be called Iraq in a few years ) .
The basic disagreement is over whether Iran is an essentially hostile power that can only be dealt with through threats and military means , or a country with which the U.S. will have to deal in the future through various means if we hope to get a resolution in Iraq that doesnt look like abject defeat .
Developments this week suggest that President Bush , probably influenced by years of demonizing Iran and the influence of Vice President Cheney , is fairly firmly on the side of an aggressive approach .
But this may not be the final outcome .
THE WE - HAVE-TO - DEAL SCENARIO
Heres one way to look at the situation :
The meetings Monday between Iranian and U.S. representatives over the future of Iraq have been mentioned mostly as fairly inconsequential , with maybe a paragraph or so inserted in a story whose main focus was which group of Iraqi parliamentarians quit that day .
But Stratfor.com thinks they re a lot more significant than that , and I m inclined to agree .
The US , Iraq and Iran have met a number of times since the first multilateral regional meeting on Iraqs future held March 10 in Baghdad , notably May 4 , May 28 and July 24 .
The talks in July lasted seven hours and the talks on Monday are said to have gone on for four hours and were described as " frank and serious , " diplo - speak for they might have gotten down to brass tacks .
Why such extensive meetings ?
The ostensible reason is to work out arrangements for stability in Iraq , and that s surely part of it .
I suspect theres more going on than the two sides trying to plead with one another to control whatever guerrillas they have influence over .
Both Iran and the U.S. must now realize they re not going to get what they had hoped for from the Iraq war , so they re trying to work out a least - damage scenario for both sides .
The U.S. , of course , is not going to get a democratic and stable Iraq that serves as a beacon and inspiration to the rest of the Middle East .
But it is also becoming clear that Iran is not going to get a de facto
Shi’ite satellite state out of the deal ; while many of Iraqs Shi’ites are friendly toward Shi’ite - dominated Iran , many of Iraqs Shi’ites still have bad feelings for Iran left over from the 1980s war .
The Sunnis may be a minority , but they re too troublesome for Iraq to be an Iranian vassal , and the Kurds are semi-autonomous ( which is a problem for Iran , which has a substantial Kurdish population in neighboring regions ) and possibly more militarily capable than either the Sunni or Shi’ite .
OTHER NEIGHBORS
Saudi Arabia is concerned too .
It doesnt want to see Iran become more dominant in the region , so it wants Iraq as a buffer .
So what the talks could have been about is determining whether theres a way to create an Iraq that is not a threat to Iran nor dominated by Iran .
It s all fiendishly complicated , and none of the parties to the talks really trust one another .
But if they succeed  a long shot  we just might see this war end through regional negotiations rather than anything resembling a military victory .
Adding to the idea that the United States might have to think of some way of dealing with Iran other than demonization , relentless hostility and threats of military action is the fact that both of our putatively most valued allies in the region have obviously come to some sort of accommodation with the mullahs regime .
When he met earlier this week with Afghan President Hamid Karzai , Bush was apparently taken aback by Karzais view that Iran has " been a helper " in Afghanistan , and brushed aside administration accusations that Iran has been arming the Taliban .
And he felt compelled to lecture Karzai in public .
" They re not a force for good , as far as we can see , " said Bush of Iran .
" They re a destabilizing influence wherever they are .
Now , the president will have to talk to you about Afghanistan .
But I would be very cautious about whether or not the Iranian influence there in Afghanistan is a positive force .
And therefore , it s going to be up to them to prove to us and prove to the government that they are . "
In other words , weve invested so much emotional energy into demonizing Iran that we consider them guilty until proven innocent , no matter the country , no matter the circumstances .
Then later in the week Bush was confronted with the fact that Iraqi prime minister Nouri al - Maliki , apparently our chosen vessel and only hope for anything remotely resembling a stable government in Iraq , had traveled to Tehran and seemed to be cozying up not just to Iran , but to its calculatedly provocative president , Ahmadinejad , even being photographed holding hands with him .
Just before leaving for a Kennebunkport weekend , Bush said he hoped Maliki was delivering a tough message to Tehran , but " if the signal is that Iran is constructive , I will have a heart to heart with my friend , the prime minister , because I dont believe they are constructive . "
" My message to him [ presumably Ahmadinejad rather than Maliki ; there might have been a veiled threat to Maliki but the Bushman doesnt often do subtle ] is , when we catch you playing a non-constructive role , there will be a price to pay . "
He also warned that " there will be consequences " if the U.S. actually catches Iranians shipping weapons into Iraq .
LIVING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES
All that tough talk may make Bush feel better , but both Karzai and Maliki know they re going to have to live in the region and they re going to have to deal with Iran , the most powerful country in the immediate neighborhood , one way or another , for the foreseeable future .
The United States might or might not be around in a few years , and even if it is it is apparent to all the players that it is far from being infinitely capable of enforcing its writ  backing up its tough talk .
So its difficult to blame Karzai and Maliki for preferring not to antagonize Iran .
They re probably a little concerned that the frat boy in the White House is so intent on antagonizing Iran on their behalf .
What s more difficult is to understand the arrogance of a leader who believes he knows , from halfway around the world and a lifetime of incuriosity about the world outside West Texas , better than those who are actually there and have been there for years , how genuinely threatening one of their neighbors is , or what the best way of dealing with that neighbor is .
It s a little reminiscent of the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
One of the justifications for the invasion was that Saddam posed such a great danger to his neighbors and to regional stability .
In fact , however , none of the actual neighbors was so concerned that they wanted to do anything more provocative than permitting the U.S. and Britain to continue enforcing the " no- fly " zones .
The Gulf States went along when it was obvious the U.S. was going to invade whether the neighbors thought it was needed or not , but there still wasnt a great deal of enthusiasm .
Curious that the U.S. is so determined to " protect " neighbors of demonized regimes who dont see much need for that kind of protection and certainly wouldnt undertake it on their own .
YOUR GUESS OR MINE
So what s going on ?
Were the Monday meetings really just a non -stop lecture from the U.S. representatives about how Iran better stop shipping weapons into Iraq or else , or was their discussion of mutual interests and how they might cooperate on some kind of a least - worst option for Iraq ?
If the discussion was the latter , did Vice President Cheney or other elements in the administration who seem to think anything hinting of diplomacy or discussion is a sign of weakness get to President Bush and badger him into making more bellicose statements ?
Or was the president simply posturing , as is his wont and the wont of all kinds of people comfortably ensconced in safe jobs in Washington where they wont have to face the consequences of their warmongering personally ?
Is the tough talk just that , or is it possibly a calculated way to hustle along a more accommodative agenda that was the real subject of the talks Monday and of ongoing talks ?
I confess that I dont know .
I still suspect that whatever the presidents knee - jerk inclinations , the military will let it be known that initiating military action against Iran would be disastrous , further decimating a military force that is already stretched too thin by the demands placed upon it in Iraq .
But my crystal ball is pretty cloudy just now .
There ’s a common and weird conception in this country of The Great Idea .
This is the idea of PageRank , a graphical user interface , or sticky notes .
Huge successes , right ?
Sure .
But for 99 % of people , The Great Idea is a big fat myth .
At the beginning of 2004 , a few friends came over to get some advice .
They wanted An Idea to start a company around .
Cool , I thought , and we started brainstorming .
But I soon realized that while they said they were looking for An Idea , they were really looking for an excuse not to do anything , to remain where they were and grind their wheels .
I ’m not into BS so I told them as much .
This is what I told them ( fade to black with a pipe in my mouth ) …
* * *
The myth of The Great Idea is a dangerous one .
It makes you constantly search and search for something that you ’ll probably never find .
My friends , for example , are still searching , and it ’s two years later .
How many of you know an older person ( maybe a parent ? ) who is always tinkering and muttering about the Great Idea he wants to find ?
Success almost never comes from a mind - blowing idea , so sitting around trying to find one is a waste of time .
Success comes from a basic idea executed amazingly well .
Ideas are rarely found by thinking .
They ’re found by doing .
I did n’t come up with the idea of IWillTeachYouToBeRich one night , staring out at the beach through a rain - drenched window .
I thought of it after getting a $ 2,000 scholarship check , investing it in the stock market , and losing half of it immediately .
( And really , is the idea of a personal - finance site really that compelling of an idea ? )
I ’ll answer my own question : No !
It ’s all in the execution .
So The Great Idea is a myth .
Now what ?
Ok , you know you want to do something entrepreneurial .
Maybe you want to write a book .
Maybe you ’re good at helping underprivileged children , and really enjoy it , but are n’t sure what to do with that .
Or maybe you are amazing at Etch - A - Sketch drawing .
Sounds good , but you do n’t have the Big Idea yet .
So what !
Most people do n’t .
But you can do better than most people because you ’ll stop searching and start doing .
These are the few steps that have worked for me and some of my entrepreneur friends .
Identify a broad , high - level goal .
It might be an industry ( “ I want to do something in fashion ” ) , it might be a lifestyle ( “ I want to have a flexible schedule ” ) , it might be some kind of financial outcome , etc .
Now you have the top of the funnel .
Now , write down the things you like and the things you do n’t like .
Be brutally honest .
I ’ve been surprised how few people do this .
I wrote down things like “ I like talking to people ” and “ I hate Excel . ”
Next , narrow the funnel down by identifying opportunities that will open up more doors in the right area .
For example , if you want to get involved in fashion , you probably do n’t want to work as an administrative assistant .
Two years after doing that , what will you have to show for it ?
Will you be any closer to your broad goal ?
On the other hand , if you intern at a fashion company , or even start a simple blog about fashion , in a few months , you will have created more opportunities for you in the right area .
In other words , if you want to be in the music business , you do n’t start working at a music store .
That wo n’t give you a leg up on any jackass who can walk in off the street and do it .
Avoid jobs / projects / opportunities that lead to dead ends .
Instead , find opportunities that open more doors in the right direction .
A couple more things :
It takes multiple steps to reach a goal .
It sounds obvious , but I know so many people who are frustrated that they can’t send one email and become a sports agent .
Being entrepreneurial , having a disproportionate impact , takes a lot of steps that do n’t necessarily have a clear payoff .
I do n’t want to belabor the point .
Just think about how this relates to you .
Also , eliminating choices is as important as finding ones that are interesting .
I have a friend who wanted to be an investment banker because , in her words , it ’s glamorous , prestigious , and there are lots of smart people .
She did an internship and realized she hated it .
Great !
Internships are your friend ; they ’re like free trials at a company .
Chalk that one up to the now - I - know - I - do n ’t - like - that category .
And now it ’s time to start doing .
Even though you may not have a sense of exactly what you want to do , you ’ve found some of the right people you want to talk to .
If you want to start a dog - food company ( or whatever ) , you do n’t have to have contacts at Kibbles .
Think laterally –do you know anyone who runs a retail business ?
Email them and take them out to lunch .
Know pet owners ?
Go over and find out what their problems are and what they ’d want from a new product .
You ’ll be surprised after talking to 10 people –I guarantee this .
People love others who are eager to learn and full of energy .
They ’ll offer you help with connections , ideas , and maybe even resources .
The idea will come .
It may be something as prosaic as “ let ’s do photos online ! ” ( Flickr , acquired by Yahoo ) or “ let ’s build a social network –for college kids ! ! ”
( The Facebook , multi- million - dollar VC - funded startup ) .
It ’s not about The Idea .
It ’s about the process that gets you there and the people around you .
And once you start doing all these things , you ’ll get closer and closer to your end game–even if you did n’t know what it was when you started .

Back to The Great Idea .
The whole reason it ’s such a terrible way to think about personal entrepreneurship is that it ’s a veiled excuse to get not get anything done : “ Oh , I ’m waiting around for an idea ” is the most foolish thing anyone can say .
The myth of the Great Idea is a great way to think yourself into oblivion and failure .
Look , at our age , there ’s nothing wrong with not knowing what we want to ultimately end up doing .
Let me say that again : Stop feeling guilty that you do n’t know exactly what you want to do !
But I think there ’s something entirely wrong with not actively trying to find out exactly what we do want .
Trying , not waiting .
Experimenting , not “ thinking about it . ”
Give it a shot .
I ca n’t wait to hear how it goes .
